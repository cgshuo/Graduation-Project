 1. Introduction
Sourcing is the process by which a firm obtains direct inputs used in the processing of its primary outputs. A range of materials needed by the firm for production, operation, supporting activities, and office operation are generally the main items of sourcing i.e. raw material, semi-finished components, subassem-blies, tools, spare parts, office stationary, etc. The sourcing is a vital decision for firm because it not only derives the cost, quality and reliability of the product and responsiveness to customer but is also one of the major components of the firm X  X  overhead cost.
With the emergence of internet and growth of the information technology many firms have realised the possibilities for cost savings and increasing their efficiency by using online procure-ment. This process for identifying, evaluating, and configuring the optimal grouping of buyers and suppliers in a supply chain that respond to changing market demands is often referred as e-sourcing ( Bichler et al., 2001 ). 1.1. Context
E-sourcing is a catchall term that refers to the use of Internet-enabled applications and decision support tools that facilitate competitive and collaborative interactions among buyers and suppliers through the use of online negotiations, reverse (decreas-ing bid) auctions, and other related tools ( Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Katok, 2006 ). The process is inherently based on traditional (forward) auctions in reverse so; it is also named as reverse auction. In forward auction (English auction) a seller offers a product for sale to the highest bidder. The seller controls the market because a product is being offered that is in demand by a number of buyers. The price offered by the buyer continues to increase until a theoretical rational price is met in the market.
Where, in reverse auction a buyer offer a tender for the supply of specific goods and services. The buyer controls the market because the item is being offered by a number of sellers. The price offered by the sellers continues to decrease until a theoretical rational market price is achieved ( Smeltzer and Amelia, 2003; Croom, 2000 ).
 e-sourcing of goods and services from last two decades in order to seek lower prices of goods and services, faster purchasing cycle, short order processing and fulfilment cycles, extend strategic sourcing to a wider range of products and services, identify and negotiate with a broad range of qualified suppliers and to lower the cost of sourcing engagement and the administrative cost ( Teich et al., 2006; Tim Minahan and Flanagan, 2001 ). On the other hand, the suppliers are motivated by the factors like potential to acquire new and wider customer base, improvement of sale and market potential, reduction in cycle time between bidding and receiving the business resulting in reduction in the excess inventory, and reduction in the cost of goods and services sold ( Smeltzer and Amelia, 2003; Teich et al., 2006 ). one-shot or single round auction and iterative or multiple round auctions. Single round auctions are sealed bid auctions. Multi-round auctions can be sealed bid or open bid, but has more than one round of bidding. After every round, there will be flow of information from auctioneer to the bidders so that the bidders can prepare their bids for next bidding round. The reverse auction process initiates with the creation of request for quotation (RFQ).
In an RFQ, a corporate buyer announces his requirements in the form of technical specification of the object, lists a number of negotiable attributes and invites potential suppliers to submit multidimensional bids on negotiable attributes. The suppliers bid against each other on internet to secure the order. These, auctions can be single round sealed bid type or it can be multi-round sealed bid/open bid type. Detailed review of the principals and procedures of online reverse auction can be referred from ( Emiliani, 2000; Chandrashekar et al., 2007 ).

There is a recent growing interest in e-sourcing by auction both in industries and academics that lead to new generation of procurement techniques depending on the verity and quantity of items to be procured i.e. volume discount auction ( Kameshwaran and Benyoucef, 2008; Kothari et al., 2003; Kameshwaran et al., 2005 ), combinatorial auction ( Kameshwaran and Benyoucef, 2008;
Cramton et al., 2006; Sandholm, 2006 ), and multi-attribute auction ( Kameshwaran and Benyoucef, 2008; Che, 1993; Bichler et al., 1999 ).
In volume discount based auction the suppliers offers discounts to the buyer on price for procurement o f large quantity of a single good by sharing the numerous economic advantages gained by reducing the processing cost of large quantity which might include reduction in manufacturing cost, packaging and handling costs, administrative cost, shipping cost, etc. ( Sadrian and Yoon, 1994 ). In volume discount based auction the suppliers bid is based on a cost function defined over quantity clearly reflecting the discount offered by the supplier on the quantity procured ( Kameshwaran et al., 2005 ).
Several approaches have been developed to deal with this problem ( Kothari et al., 2003; Kameshwaran et al., 2005, 2007; Eso et al., 2005; Kameshwaran and Narahari 2009a; Sadrian and Yoon 1994; Goossens et al., 2007 ).

Combinatorial auction CA allows package bidding, that is, quoting a single cost for a bundle (subset) of items for procuring a set of related heterogeneous items ( Kameshwaran and Benyoucef, 2008 ). The supplier can bid on a combination of items by providing a single bid price ( Cramton et al., 2006 ). The bid price is conditional on winning the entire combination of items. The supplier can submit more than one bid and the items in different bids can be overlapping. Winner determination problems for combinatorial bids are well studied and various algorithms like algorithms that find a provable optimal solution but with higher computational time ( Sandholm, 2006 ), algorithms that are fast with guaranteed computational time but can only find a feasible, not necessarily an optimal solution ( Lehmann et al., 2002 ), and the algorithms that restrict the bundles/combinations on which bids can be submitted in order to obtain fast optimal solution ( Rothkopf et al., 1998 ) are proposed.

In many real life situations, it is essential to consider multiple attributes of a deal in addition to price for negotiation and selection through a more effective information exchange of buyer X  X  preferences and supplier X  X  offerings. Such auctions are termed as multi-attribute ( Strecker and Seifert, 2004; Bichler and
Kalagnanam, 2005 ), multidimensional ( Che, 1993; Branco, 1999 ), multiple issue ( Teich and Wallenius, 1999 ), and multi-criteria ( Smete and Multicriteria, 2002 ) auction. In a multi-attribute reverse auction (MARA), the auctioneer chooses multiple negoti-able attributes of an object and defines a scoring rule (value or utility function) based on his preference relation. During the auction process, the auctioneer collects bids from invited bidders (suppliers) according to the rules of the bidding procedure. The buyer X  X  scoring rule is used to evaluate submitted bids and to designate the contract to the highest utility score to the bidder ( Che, 1993; Bichler et al., 1999 ). 1.2. Motivation
Traditionally e-sourcing are based on reverse auctions (volumetric and combinatorial) in which price is the unique strategic dimension and all non-price attributes of an object are fixed prior to the negotiation ( X  X  X rice-only auctions X  X ). Most of the practitioners and researchers view the reverse auction as an effective e-sourcing mechanism for bargaining with suppliers, in order to reduce the unit price of the purchase products taki ng into consideration the afore-mentioned approaches ( Tim Minahan and Flanagan, 2001; Emiliani, 2000; Chandrashekar et al., 2007; Kameshwaran and Benyoucef, 2008; Kothari et al., 2003; Kameshwaran et al., 2005; Cramton et al., 2006; Sandholm, 2006 ), without giving proper consideration to other important attributes of a deal such as production capabilities, financial implication to supplier s ide, delivery time, quality, after sales service, terms of payment, acceptance of company commercial terms, compliance to specifications, e tc. Although price-only auctions have been reported to lower explicit and implicit transaction costs for the buyer, they potentially lead to inefficient outcomes when differences in quality exist and supplier X  X  exhibit comparative advantages in production costs ( Strecker and Seifert, 2004 ).
Most of the MARA methods are developed based on the concept of accurate measurement and crisp evaluation i.e. exact measuring values such as price in $, delay in days, etc. In real B2B purchasing the price only methodologies or the methodologies which convert all the attributes in terms of price does not provide the best solution to the auctioneers, resulting in loosing of best selection. The decision process of selecting an appropriate alternative usually has to take several qualitative and quantitative attributes, making the selection process complex and challenging. In order to incorporate qualitative and quantitative multi-attributes in winner determination problem of reverse auction in this article we have formulated the problem as multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problem.

In MADM problems the qualitative attributes depends upon the judgement of decision makers. Due to the vagueness of human being X  X  thought, the selection is often based on inadequate information or personal judgments resulting in inappropriate and biased decision. The fuzzy MCDM (fuzzy multiple criteria decision making, FMCDM) approach can explain more appropriately decision maker X  X  evaluation of available alternatives for the selection of best solution when critical criteria have subjective perceptions. Therefore, the evaluation process must be conducted in a fuzzy environment taking into account linguistic variables. In this article WD problem for single round reverse e-auction is formulated as MCDM problem and is solved by a version of TOPSIS in fuzzy environment while taking into consideration both subjective (qualitative) and objective (quantitative) attribute X  X . TOPSIS is an ideal method for evaluating alternatives simulta-neously on the basis of cost criteria X  X  and benefits criteria X  X . It bases upon the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS), i.e., the solution that maximises the cost criteria and minimises the benefit criteria. This study includes fuzzy TOPSIS methodology to improve the quality and efficiency of reverse auction process. 1.3. Contributions
The main contributions of this article are: a) WD problem of reverse auctions is formulated as fuzzy multiple criteria decision making problem for considering both quantitative and qualitative attributes. Fuzzy is incorpo-rated to remove the vagueness of the decision makers.
Although, the fuzzy TOPSIS method used to solve the problem is not novel its application in the e-sourcing is proposed first time by the authors. b) New attributes for reverse auction are proposed after several rounds of discussions with the industries. c) Very simple methods for determining the linguistic value of alternatives for criterion directly from the bid submitted by the suppliers without the interference of decision makers has been proposed. Decision makers are indirectly involved for setting the rules for identification of linguistic values. d) Entropy method is proposed for determination of the weights of the criterion.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we give brief literature review of multi-attribute auction and fuzzy
MCDM approaches. Section 3 deals with the problem environ-ment. In Section 4 we focus on preliminary definitions of fuzzy, and introduce the concept of fuzzy multi-attribute reveres auction method. Section 5 details the proposed methodology. An illustrative example is provided in Section 6. The final section makes conclusion. 2. State of the art
A number of researchers have considered generalizations of standard price only auction theory to the multi-attribute reverse auction by selecting quantitative and qualitative attributes such as delivery time, the colour or quality grade of the product, warranty terms, etc. along with price for negotiation with suppliers by reverse auction ( Che, 1993; Bichler et al., 1999;
Branco, 1999 ). However, only a few research works have considered multi-attribute reverse auction (MARA) so far. In this section, some important methods of multi-attribute reverse auction are summarised.

We have used fuzzy TOPSIS, a fuzzy MCDM methodology to solve the WD problem of MARA. A brief overview and applications of some fuzzy MCDM methodologies and fuzzy TOPSIS is also provided in this section. 2.1. Multi-attribute reverse auction
Che (1993) investigated two-dimensional (price and quality) sealed-bid auctions in government contracting. Che proposed an optimal scoring rule based on the assumption that the buyer knows the probability distribution of the supplier X  X  cost para-meters and there costs are independent of each other. Branco (1999 ) extended Che X  X  (1993 ) work by proposing a two-stage auction model to correlate costs among suppliers, where, in the first stage, a supplier is selected and in the second stage, the buyer bargains about the level of quality to be provided. However, both the methods considered only cost and quality as attribute. Beil and Wein (2003 ) examined a mechanism by which the buyer can learn the suppliers X  cost functions when suppliers are assumed to bid myopically. Asker and Cantillon (2004) explored the general properties of multi-attribute auctions when the buyer X  X  scoring function is linear in price. Researchers have successfully used laboratory experiments of multi-attribute auction mechanisms. In
Bichler (2000 ), the bidding takes place in two dimensions in the context of financial derivatives. In Chen-Ritzo et al. (2005) , bidding takes place in three dimensions (price, quality, and delivery time). In both studies, the scoring rules are proposed for multi-attribute auction to increase efficiency and buyer X  X  welfare.
In all these methods only quantitative attributes such as cost, delay, and quality are considered for solving the WD problem. theory (MAUT) to carry out bid evaluation in multiple issue reverse auction process using ABSoulte software and WORA weight assessment methodology. However the details of the methodology are not provided. David et al. (2002) studied a multi-round variant of a multi-attribute reverse auction in which the buyer announces a scoring rule and suppliers bid sequentially in a randomly defined order. The supplier X  X  costs are indepen-dently distributed and the distribution function is known by the buyer. Detailed review of multi-attribute reverse auction and their design features can be referred at Teich et al. (2004 ). Most of the multi-attribute reverse auction mechanisms discussed above assumes that the multi-attribute bids are described as attribute value pairs of only price and delay as quantitative attributes and qualitative attributes are not considered for analysis. winner determination problems in case of multiple sourcing multi-attribute reverse auction. The objective is to find the combination of suppliers offers which collectively satisfy the demand and maximise a sourcing function. They extended the concept of multi-attribute auctions to allow for configurable offers which enable suppliers to specify multiple values and price markups for each attribute. In addition, suppliers can define configuration and discount rules in form of propositional logic statements. These extensions provide suppliers with more flexibility in the specification of their bids and allow for an efficient information exchange among market participants. Each bid contains a number of different configurations, and the buyer solves the demand allocation problem by selection the optimum combination of configurable offers submitted by various bidders.
They used branch and bond approach to solve the problem. The methodology proposed by Bichler and Kalagnanam (2005 )is complex and needs excessive computational time with increase in the complexity of problem.
 mechanism called NegotiAuction , for auctioning multiple units of an item, primarily in B2B e-sourcing using pricing out technique and suggested an optimization-based mechanism to help the bidders in determination of best price acceptable to the buyer.
The proposed NegotiAuction mechanism performs the bidding process in two different stages. The first stage minimise the total buyer cost by a linear programming model and designates each the NegotiAuction system solves another linear programming model for maximising the bidding price under the constraint to reduce the buyer X  X  total cost by a predefined amount. The bidder can then choose to accept or reject the suggested price, or to change the bid in order to obtain a new price from the system to make her bid active. In this method also only price and delay attributes are considered.
 e-sourcing of multiple unit of a single item with multi-attributes, while taking into consideration volume discount cost functions, business constraints, and multiple criteria in bid evaluation from the buyer X  X  perspective. The bid evaluation problem is formulated as a mixed linear integer multiple criteria optimization problem and goal programming is used as the solution technique.
However, the approach proposed by them is complex in nature and computationally difficult to solve. As the number of supplier and attributes increases their approach will take very long computational time.
 multiple-attribute reverse auction problem, using multiple-criterion decision-making (MCDM) approaches. The model is designed to satisfy the interests of both the auctioneer and the bidders. From the auctioneer perspective, Technique for Order
Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is utilised to determine the winning bidder by considering the process as a multiple-attribute decision-making problem. From the supplier perspective, fuzzy multiple-objective programming and an exhausted enumeration algorithm are proposed to help the bidders in construction of a bid which is both profitable and likely to secure the contract. Accurate estimation of the produc-tion costs associated with specific delivery dates is made by making adjustments in the production plan, based on the current master production schedule (MPS) and the available-to-promise (ATP) inventory. Although, Chi-Bin (2008 ) proposed a MCDM (TOPSIS) approach for determining the winning bid they consider only crisp values for evaluation. 2.2. Fuzzy MCDM
Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) provides effective frame-work for ranking and selection of one or more options from a set of alternatives based on evaluation of their multiple conflicting attributes ( Wang and Lee, 2009 ). A number of approaches have been proposed for solving MCDM problems such as analytical hierarchy process (AHP), data env elopment analysis (DEA), and
TOPSIS. These are classical MCDM approaches which measures the alternative ratings and weights of the criteria X  X  in crisp or precise numbers which depends upon decisi on makers judgement/prefer-ences ( Wang and Lee, 2009 ).

In real life the judgement of the decision makers may not be correct as it depends upon the uncertainty of human judgement.
In such cases fuzzy set theory is used to model the human judgement. Such problems are known as fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) problems ( Wang et al., 2003 ). FMCDM methods evaluates the alternative ratings and the weights of criteria on imprecision and vagueness expressed by linguistic terms which are further converted into fuzzy numbers i.e. fuzzy AHP, fuzzy ANP, fuzzy TOPSIS, etc.

AHP proposed by Saaty (1980) decomposes a complex problem into a hierarchy. Elements at given hierarchy levels are compared in pairs to assess their relative preference with respect to each of the elements at the next higher level. However in certain cases where the crisp pair wise comparison is insufficient and imprecise to capture the degree of ratings fuzzy AHP is used. Many variants of fuzzy AHP are proposed by various researchers to solve the selection problems in different fields of application such as supplier selection, project selection, manufacturing system selec-tion, machine selection, etc. ( Vaidya and Kumar, 2006) .
Analytical Network Process (ANP) ( Satty, 1996 ) provides a general framework to deal with decisions without making assumptions about the independence of higher level elements from lower level elements and about the independence of the elements within a level. ANP uses a network of the problem without the need to specify levels as in a hierarchy and then use a system of pair wise comparisons to measure the weights of the components of the structure, and finally to rank the alternatives in the decision. In ANP the preferences of decision makers are crisp values while in case of fuzzy ANP they are fuzzy numbers and also fuzzy arithmetic is used to evaluate the decision. ANP is used in many kind of decision making and priority setting problems. In the literature examples to the application of ANP selection ( Mohanty et al., 2005 ), SWOT analysis ( Y  X  uksel and
Da  X  gdeviren, 2007 ), etc. However, when the numbers of alter-natives are more AHP/fuzzy AHP and ANP/fuzzy ANP does not provide feasible solution.

In case of fuzzy AHP and fuzzy ANP the preferences are required to be provided by decision makers. These methods can be used for strategic decision making where time of decision making is not very important. However, in our case we are dealing with on-line reverse auction where decision time is very important, so, AHP/ANP and other decision making methods which use X  X  evaluation by decision makers cannot be used. In this article we propose a fuzzy extension of TOPSIS approach. The advantage of proposed approach is that it not only benefits from decision makers expertise, but also involves the buyers and suppliers into the whole decision making process.

Technique for Order Performance by similarity to Ideal solution (TOPSIS), one of the most classical methods for solving MCDM problem, was first developed by Hwang and Yoon (1981 ). It is based on the principle that the chosen alternative should have the longest distance from the negative-ideal solution i.e. the solution that maximises the cost criteria and minimises the benefits criteria; and the shortest distance from the positive-ideal solution i.e. the solution that maximises the benefit criteria and minimises the cost criteria. In classical TOPSIS ( Hwang and Yoon, 1981 ), the rating and weight of the criteria are known precisely. However, under many real situations crisp data are inadequate to model real life situation since human judgement are vague and cannot be estimated with exact numeric values. To resolve the ambiguity frequently arising in information from human judge-ment fuzzy set theory ( Zadeh, 1965 ) has been incorporated in many MCDM methods including TOPSIS. In fuzzy TOPSIS all the ratings and weights are defined by means of linguistic variables.
A number of fuzzy TOPSIS methods and applications have been developed in recent years. Chen and Hwang (1992 ) first applied fuzzy numbers to establish fuzzy TOPSIS. Triantaphyllou and Lin (1996 ) developed a fuzzy TOPSIS method in which relative closeness for each alternative is evaluated based on fuzzy arithmetic operations. Liang (1999 ) proposed Fuzzy MCDM based on ideal and anti-ideal concepts. Chen (2000 ) considered triangular fuzzy numbers and defined crisp Euclidean distance between two fuzzy numbers to extend the TOPSIS method to fuzzy GDM situations. Chu (2002) and ChuandLin(2002) further improved the methodology proposed by Chen (2000) . Jahanshahloo et al. (2006) and Chu and Lin (2009 ) extended the fuzzy TOPSIS method based on alpha level sets with interval arithmetic. Chena and Li-Wei (2010 ) extended fuzzy TOPSIS based on type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS method in order to provide additional degree of freedom to represent the uncertainties and fuzziness of the real world. The fuzzy TOPSIS approach is applied to verity of problems like evaluation of initial training aircraft ( Wang and Chang, 2007 ), industrial robotic system ( Kahraman et al., 2007 ), Plant selection ( Yong, 2006 ), supplier selection (Chena et al., 2006) , etc. by various researcher.
In this article we have modified Wang and Lee (2009 ) approach which is extension of the Chen ( Wang et al., 2003 ) approach automatically calculate the weights of the criterions using entropy method ( Pomerol and Romero, 2000 ) without direct involvement of the decision makers. The method is further modified to incorporate the automatic enumeration of fuzzy linguistic variable preferences directly from the quotation provided by the suppliers. The decision makers are only involved in selection of criterions, and rules for evaluation of linguistic variables from the supplier X  X  quotation. 3. Problem environment
In this research work, a particular case of sealed-bid reverse auction for B2B Industrial purchase is considered, in which the bid has multiple attributes. There is only one buyer and many suppliers, and only one supplier can win the bidding process (sole sourcing). Only qualified suppliers are selected for the auction. Three quantitative attributes price (C 1 ), delay (C time between failure (C 3 ); and three qualitative attributes terms-of-payment (C 4 ), acceptance of company commercial terms (C and compliance to specifications (C 6 ) are considered for evalua-tion of the winning bid (see Table 1 ). Attributes C 1 and C criteria X  X  which auctioneer wants to minimise where C 3 ,C , and C 6 are benefit attributes which auctioneer wants to maximise. 4. Theoretical background
Although fuzzy MCDM/TOPSIS is a well discussed concept with several applications, in this section the theoretical background of methodology proposed in this article is highlighted. In many situations where performance rating and weights cannot be given precisely, the fuzzy set theory is introduced to model the uncertainty of human judgments and such problems is known as fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (FMCDM). Zadeh (1965 ) first introduced fuzzy set theory into MCDM as an approach for effectively dealing with the inherent imprecision, vagueness and ambiguity of the human decision making process. 4.1. Fuzzy set and fuzzy number
Fuzzy set theory which is an extension of ordinary set theory was introduced by Zadeh (1965 ) for dealing with uncertainty and imprecision associated with information. The preliminary of fuzzy set theory used for development of fuzzy TOPSIS method used in this article is as follows: is characterised by a membership function m ~ a ( x ) which associate each element x in X , a real number in the interval [0,1].
Membership function m ~ a ( x ) is termed as the grade of membership of x in ~ a ( Zadeh, 1965 ). ~ a  X f x , m ~ a  X  x  X  9 x A X g :  X  1  X 
Definition 2. ( Fuzzy number) . A fuzzy number is a quantity whose value is imprecise, rather than exact as is the case with  X  X  X rdinary X  X  (single-valued) numbers. Any fuzzy number can be thought of as a function whose domain is a specified set usually the set of real numbers, and whose range is the span of non-negative real numbers between, and including, 0 and 1. Each numerical value in the domain is assigned a specific  X  X  X rade of membership X  X  where 0 represents the smallest possible grade, and 1 is the largest possible grade.

The fuzzy number, ~ a 2 is closer to fuzzy number, ~ a 1 than other fuzzy number, ~ a 3 if, and only if, d  X  ~ a 1 , ~ a 2  X  o d 4.1.1. Arithmetic operations on fuzzy numbers 1965 ) are as follows: ~ a 1  X  ~ a 2  X  a 1  X  a 2 , b 1  X  b 2 , c 1  X  c 2  X  X  X  4  X  ~ a 1 ~ a 2  X  a 1 a 2 , b 1 b 2 , c 1 c 2  X  X  X  5  X  ~ a 1 ~ a 2  X  X  a 1 a 2 , b 1 b 2 , c 1 c 2  X  X  6  X  ~ a = ~ a 2  X  X  a 1 = a 2 , b 1 = b 2 , c 1 = c 2  X  X  7  X   X  ~ a k  X  X  X  a 1 k , b 1 k , c 1 k  X  , for k A X  X  8  X  4.1.2. Linguistic values
A linguistic variable is a variable whose values are expressed in linguistic terms. The linguistic variable is a very helpful concept for dealing with situations which are too complex or not well-defined enough to be reasonably described by traditional quantitative expression ( Zadeh, 1965 ). For example, Chen and
Hwang (1992 ) considered  X  X  X elevance X  X  as a linguistic variable whose values include VG(very good), G(good), MG(medium good),
F(fair), P(poor), MP(medium poor) and VP(very poor) which can be further represented by triangular fuzzy numbers such as
VG(0.8, 1, 1), G(0.65, 0.8, 0.95), MG(0.5, 0.65, 0.8), F(0.35, 0.5, 0.65), P(0.2, 0.35, 0.5), MP(0.05, 0.2, 0.35), and VP(0,0,0.2). The fuzzy linguistic terms and their corresponding values proposed by
Chen and Hwang, 1992 ) is shown in Table 2 . 4.2. Fuzzy TOPSIS
In this article, we propose an fuzzy extension of TOPSIS method which integrates the entropy method ( Pomerol and
Romero, 2000 ) for determination of attributes weights. The steps of the fuzzy TOPSIS method ( Wang and Lee, 2009; Chen, 2000 ) used in this study can be outlined as follows: Step 1: Construct the fuzzy decision matrix
Assume there are m alternatives (bidders) A i ( i  X  1,2, y
MADM can be concisely expressed in matrix format as Eqs. (9) and (10).
 ~ D  X 
W  X  ~ w 1 , ~ w 2 , ... , ~ w n  X  10  X  triangular fuzzy numbers, ~ w j  X  X  ~ w j 1 , ~ w j 2 , ~ w ~ x ij is the performance rating of the i th alternative A i with respect to j th criteria C j and ~ w j represent the weight of the j th criteria C j .
 Step 2: Normalise the fuzzy decision matrix
The raw data are normalised to eliminate anomalies with different measurement units and scales in several MCDM problems. However, the purpose of linear scales transform normalisation function used in this study is to preserve the property that the ranges of normalised triangular fuzzy numbers to be included in [0,1]. If QUOTE denotes the normalised fuzzy decision matrix, then ~ R  X  ~ r ij m n , i  X  1 , 2 , ... , m and j  X  1 , 2 , ... , n  X  11  X  Where, for fuzzy data denoted by triangular fuzzy number as ( a , b ij , c ij ), the normalised values for benefit-related criteria and cost-related criteria are calculated as follows: ~ r  X  ~ r  X  where j  X  max i c ij if j A B a  X  min i a ij if j A C Step 3: Construct weighted normalised fuzzy decision matrix
Considering the different weight of each criterion, the weighted normalised decision matrix can be computed by multiplying the importance weights of evaluation criteria and the values in the normalised fuzzy decision matrix. The weighted normalised decision matrix ~ V is defined as ~ V  X  ~ v ij m n , i  X  1 , 2 , ... , m ; j  X  1 , 2 , ... , 3 n  X  14  X  ~ v  X  ~ r ij ~ w ij  X  15  X  where ~ w ij is fuzzy weight of the criteria C j .

Step 4: Determine the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution.

Because the positive triangular fuzzy numbers are included in the interval [0,1], the fuzzy positive ideal reference point ( FPIRP, A + ) and fuzzy negative ideal reference point ( FNIRP, A ) can be defined as A  X   X  ~ v  X  1 , ~ v  X  2 , ... , ~ v  X  j A  X  ~ v 1 , ~ v 2 , ... , ~ v j
Step 5: Calculate the distances of each initial alternative to FPIRP and FNIRP
The distance of each alternative from fuzzy positive ideal reference point and fuzzy negative ideal reference point can be derived, respectively, as follows: d  X  where d ~ v ij , ~ v  X  j numbers and is calculated by Eq. (3). d  X  i represents the distance of alternative Ai from FPIRP, and d i is the distance of alternative Ai from FNIRP .

Step 6: Obtain the closeness coefficient and rank the order of alternatives Calculate the closeness coefficient ( CC ) of each alternative as CC
An alternative with index CC i approaching 1 indicates that the alternative is close to the fuzzy positive ideal reference point and far from the fuzzy negative ideal reference point. Rank each CC of each alternative in descending order. The alternative with the highest CC value will be the best choice. 5. Solution methodology
This section describes the solution methodology used in this research work. Initially the bidder issue RFQ to qualified suppliers.
The RFQ provides a complete definition of the buyer X  X  require-ments and include details such as the quantity, the product specification, delivery time, details of terms of payment, company commercial terms, etc. In the RFQ the mandatory and negotiable components of various attributes specially the qualitative attri-butes are clearly mentioned. Only the suppliers agreeing to fulfil the mandatory components of the specific attributes qualifies for auction. Fig. 2 illustrates the different stages of the developed methodology.
 maximising their own benefits while simultaneously satisfying the buyers requirements laid out in the RFQ. The bids are then submitted to auctioneer. The automated procurement model checks whether all the mandatory requirements are satisfied or not. The non-satisfying bids are re-sent to the respective suppliers for re-formulation.
Stage II: After receiving all the bids the auctioneer solve this multi-attribute winner determination problem using fuzzy TOP-
SIS method by identifying the bid which lies at the shortest distance from the ideal solution, and at farthest distance from negative idle solution as the optimum bid. This stage is characterised by formulation of fuzzy decision matrix for solving the WD problem of multi-attribute reverse auction (MARA) using fuzzy TOPSIS. Linguistic terms proposed by Chen and Hwang ( Saaty, 1980 ) are used to formulate the decision matrix. The linguistic terms range from  X  X ery poor X  to  X  X ery good. The specific term  X  X ery X  is utilised to stress the degree of each alternative for each attribute. Table 2 and Fig. 3 illustrates each fuzzy linguistic term to its correspondent triangular fuzzy number for each alternative. The construction of fuzzy decision matrix consists of two steps: i. Evaluation of quantitative attributes ii. Evaluation of qualitative attributes i. Evaluation of quantitative attributes
The quantitative attributes are normalised into the range of [0 X 1] using Eqs. (21) and (22) and the respective linguistic values are determined form the membership function shown in Fig. 3 . ii) Cost attributes (smaller the better type) ii. Evaluation of qualitative attributes
In order to determine the performance rating of the bids for qualitative attributes using linguistic variables, the bids are rated on the basis of level of their compliance to the components or sub-attributes. Four types of methods namely decision makers preference, number method, rule based method, utility function scoring and methods are used for preference ranking of qualitative attributes. (a) Direct preference . Linguistic variable scoring may be (b) Depending on numbers . For attribute C 5 suppose the
Once the linguistic variable decision matrix is constructed all the linguistic variables are converted in to triangular fuzzy numbers using Table 2 .
 Stage III: The next stage is evaluation of weights . In the proposed TOPSIS based e-sourcing methodology  X  X  X ntropy Method X  X  [Poremal 2000] is used to determine the weights w j of the 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1 0.5 0 attributes. The weights are ascertained without the direct involvement of the decision maker. The entropy method is based on believe that importance of a criterion is direct function of the information conveyed by it relative to whole set of alternatives. It is based on the principle that a criterion is more important, if there is a greater dispersion in the evaluations of the alternatives.
The main advantage of entropy method over the conventional methods is that it removes the subjectivity of decision maker in determining the weights and is very useful in the cases when decision makers conflicts on the values of weights.

The entropy method works as follows: a) Obtain the crisp decision matrix. b) Normalise the decision matrix to obtain the projection value P for each alternative of alternative for criterion j . c) The entropy,  X  En i  X  of each criterion  X  j  X  is enumerated as En j  X  k where k is a constant and determined through relation k  X  1 = ln  X  m  X  d) Measure of Dispersion  X  X P j  X  of the intrinsic information of each criterion C j as DP j  X  1 En j  X  25  X 
Measure of Dispersion represents the inherent contrast intensity of C j . The higher the DP j is the more important the criterion C j is for the problem. e) Finally, objective weight  X  w j  X  of each attribute C j w j  X  DP j P n f) Convert the crisp weights into triangular fuzzy numbers by using Fig. 3 and Table 2 .

Stage IV: Once the fuzzy decision matrix is formulated and the weights are evaluated using Step 2 X  X tep 4 mentioned in fuzzy
TOPSIS methodology in Section 4.2 the ranking of various bids can determined for identification of best bid. 6. Empirical illustration methodology is provided. An RFQ is generated and is sent to fifteen preselected suppliers. The suppliers analyse the RFQ X  X  and provide their preferences in the form of bid. As mentioned in the model presented in Fig. 2 all the bids are checked for the respective bidder X  X  agreement to the mandatory terms or sub-attributes. All the qualified bids are evaluated for determination of the best bid as mentioned in the previous section. The computational procedure is summarised as below: submitted bids is given in Table 3 . Attributes C1, C2, and C3 are crisp values where the attributes C4, C5, and C6 are linguistic variables. The linguistic scores of each bid for attributes C4, C5, and C6 are determined using Stage II (ii) of solution methodology given in Section 5.

C2, and C3 are normalised into the range of [0 X 1] using Eqs. (21) and (22) in order to transform the performance ratings to fuzzy linguistic variables.
 attributes. The normalised values are shown in Table 4 . By using membership function shown in Fig. 3 the normalised scores of C1,
C2, and C3 are converted in linguistic variable. The resulting fuzzy linguistic variables decision matrix for the problem are shown in
Table 5 . By converting the fuzzy linguistic variables into triangular fuzzy membership numbers using Table 2 the fuzzy decision matrix is obtained. The fuzzy decision matrix is shown in Table 6 .

The next stage is determination of weights of the attributes using the entropy method. Crisp decision matrix is obtained by converting all the fuzzy linguistic variables given in Table 3 into
Next using Eqs. (23) X (26) the crisp weights of the attributes are determined. These crisp weights are further converted into fuzzy linguistic weights using membership function given in Fig. 3 .
Table 7 shows the normalised crisp decision matrix. Table 8 shows the weight calculation by entropy method for all the six attributes.

In the next step weighted normalised fuzzy decision matrix,  X  ~ v ij m n is enumerated. Table 9 shows, the fuzzy weighted decision matrix which is calculated by using Eqs. (14) and (15). Since, the triangular fuzzy numbers are in the range of [0 X 1] they are not normalised further.

From Table 9 , it is established that the elements ~ v ij normalised positive triangular fuzzy numbers in closed interval [0 X 1]. Thus, the fuzzy positive ideal solution ( FPIS, A + fuzzy negative ideal solution ( FNIS, A ) can be defined as: ~ v  X   X  X  1 , 1 , 1  X  and ~ v j  X  X  0 , 0 , 0  X  , j  X  1,2 y , n .
The distance d + and d of each alternative from A + and A is derived, respectively, by using Eqs. (18), (19), and (3). The closeness coefficient ( CC i ) for each alternative is obtained using
Eq. (20). The final results obtained by proposed fuzzy TOPSIS analysis are shown in Table 10 . According to the analysis, the best performer among the 15 bids is bid 1 (B1). The overall performance ranking is B1 4 B7 4 B11 4 B10 4 B6 4 B15 4 B4 4 B2 4 B5 4 B3 4 B14 4 B8 4 B9 4 B13 4 B12. 7. Conclusion
This article presents a methodology for solving the problem of winner determination (WD) by multi-attribute reverse auction, in a manufacturing industry setup. The auctioneer is buyer and the seller X  X  bids and offers desired item or service. Most reverse auction mechanism are based on price and attributes quantified in terms of price therefore leading to a poor bid selection due to the MADM nature of the reverse auction problem. In the proposed methodology a number of quantitative and qualitative attributes are considered to formulate the WD problem in MADM frame-work. In order to address the imprecision and vagueness of the decision makers in giving exact opinion about the alternatives the present study explore the use of fuzzy in solving a problem of winner determination in reverse auction by TOPSIS method. Some mechanisms are also suggested for determining the fuzzy score of the qualitative attributes on the basis of data provided by the bidders. With an illustrative example the proposed methodology is validated. It is found the Bid 1 is the highest rank bid and the order of ranking of various bids is B1 4 B7 4 B11 4 B10 4 B6 4 B15 4 B4 4 B2 4 B5 4 B3 4 B14 4 B8 4 B9 4 B13 4 B12.

In future methodologies may be developed for helping the sellers in formulating their bids. An extensive comparison can be made for various subjective and objective and combined sub-jective-objective weight determination methodology on the ranking of various bids as extension of this research.
