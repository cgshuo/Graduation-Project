 Distributed representations have become an in-creasingly important tool in machine learning. Such representations X  X ypically continuous vec-tors learned in an unsupervised setting X  X an fre-quently be used in place of hand-crafted, and thus expensive, features. By providing a richer rep-resentation than what can be encoded in discrete settings, distributed representations have been suc-cessfully used in many areas. This includes AI and reinforcement learning (Mnih et al., 2013), image retrieval (Kiros et al., 2013), language modelling (Bengio et al., 2003), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2011; Hermann and Blunsom, 2013), frame-semantic parsing (Hermann et al., 2014), and doc-ument classification (Klementiev et al., 2012).
In Natural Language Processing (NLP), the use of distributed representations is motivated by the idea that they could capture semantics and/or syn-tax, as well as encoding a continuous notion of similarity, thereby enabling information sharing between similar words and other units. The suc-cess of distributed approaches to a number of tasks, such as listed above, supports this notion and its implied benefits (see also Turian et al. (2010) and Collobert and Weston (2008)).

While most work employing distributed repre-sentations has focused on monolingual tasks, mul-tilingual representations would also be useful for several NLP-related tasks. Such problems include document classification, machine translation, and cross-lingual information retrieval, where multi-lingual data is frequently the norm. Furthermore, learning multilingual representations can also be useful for cross-lingual information transfer, that is exploiting resource-fortunate languages to gen-erate supervised data in resource-poor ones.
We propose a probabilistic model that simulta-neously learns word alignments and bilingual dis-tributed word representations. As opposed to pre-vious work in this field, which has relied on hard alignments or bilingual lexica (Klementiev et al., 2012; Mikolov et al., 2013), we marginalize out the alignments, thus capturing more bilingual se-mantic context. Further, this results in our dis-tributed word alignment (DWA) model being the first probabilistic account of bilingual word repre-sentations. This is desirable as it allows better rea-soning about the derived representations and fur-thermore, makes the model suitable for inclusion in higher-level tasks such as machine translation. The contributions of this paper are as follows. We present a new probabilistic similarity measure which is based on an alignment model and prior language modeling work which learns and relates word representations across languages. Subse-quently, we apply these embeddings to a standard document classification task and show that they outperform the current published state of the art (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014b). As a by-product we develop a distributed version of F AST A LIGN (Dyer et al., 2013), which performs on par with the original model, thereby demonstrating the ef-ficacy of the learned bilingual representations. The IBM alignment models, introduced by Brown et al. (1993), form the basis of most statistical ma-chine translation systems. In this paper we base our alignment model on F AST A LIGN (FA), a vari-ation of IBM model 2 introduced by Dyer et al. (2013). This model is both fast and produces alignments on par with the state of the art. Further, to induce the distributed representations we incor-porate ideas from the log-bilinear language model presented by Mnih and Hinton (2007). 2.1 IBM Model 2 Given a parallel corpus with aligned sentences, an alignment model can be used to discover matching words and phrases across languages. Such mod-els are an integral part of most machine translation pipelines. An alignment model learns p ( f , a | e ) (or p ( e , a 0 | f ) ) for the source and target sentences e and f (sequences of words). a represents the word alignment across these two sentences from source to target. IBM model 2 (Brown et al., 1993) learns alignment and translation probabilities in a gener-ative style as follows: p ( f , a | e ) = p ( J | I ) where p ( J | I ) captures the two sentence lengths; p ( a j | j,I,J ) the alignment and p f j | e a translation probability. Sentence likelihood is given by marginalizing out the alignments, which results in the following equation: p ( f | e ) = p ( J | I ) We use F AST A LIGN (FA) (Dyer et al., 2013), a log-linear reparametrization of IBM model 2. This model uses an alignment distribution defined by a single parameter that measures how close the alignment is to the diagonal. This replaces the original multinomial alignment distribution which often suffered from sparse counts. This improved model was shown to run an order of magnitude faster than IBM model 4 and yet still outperformed it in terms of the BLEU score and, on Chinese-English data, in alignment error rate (AER). 2.2 Log-Bilinear Language Model Language models assign a probability measure to sequences of words. We use the log-bilinear language model proposed by Mnih and Hinton (2007). It is an n-gram based model defined in terms of an energy function E( w n ; w 1: n  X  1 ) . The probability for predicting the next word w n given its preceding context of n  X  1 words is expressed using the energy function where Z c = normalizer, r w C and b r  X  R d , b w biases respectively. Here, the sum of the trans-formed context-word vectors endeavors to be close to the word we want to predict, since the likelihood in the model is maximized when the energy of the observed data is minimized.

This model can be considered a variant of a log-linear language model in which, instead of defining binary n-gram features, the model learns the features of the input and output words, and a transformation between them. This provides a vastly more compact parameterization of a lan-guage model as n-gram features are not stored. 2.3 Multilingual Representation Learning There is some recent prior work on multilin-gual distributed representation learning. Simi-lar to the model presented here, Klementiev et al. (2012) and Zou et al. (2013) learn bilingual embeddings using word alignments. These two models are non-probabilistic and conditioned on the output of a separate alignment model, un-like our model, which defines a probability dis-tribution over translations and marginalizes over all alignments. These models are also highly re-lated to prior work on bilingual lexicon induc-tion (Haghighi et al., 2008). Other recent ap-proaches include Sarath Chandar et al. (2013), Lauly et al. (2013) and Hermann and Blunsom (2014a, 2014b). These models avoid word align-ment by transferring information across languages using a composed sentence-level representation.
While all of these approaches are related to the model proposed in this paper, it is important to note that our approach is novel by providing a probabilistic account of these word embeddings. Further, we learn word alignments and simultane-ously use these alignments to guide the represen-tation learning, which could be advantageous par-ticularly for rare tokens, where a sentence based approach might fail to transfer information.
Related work also includes Mikolov et al. (2013), who learn a transformation matrix to reconcile monolingual embedding spaces, in an l norm sense, using dictionary entries instead of alignments, as well as Schwenk et al. (2007) and Schwenk (2012), who also use distributed repre-sentations for estimating translation probabilities. Faruqui and Dyer (2014) use a technique based on CCA and alignments to project monolingual word representations to a common vector space. Here we describe our distributed word alignment (DWA) model. The DWA model can be viewed as a distributed extension of the FA model in that it uses a similarity measure over distributed word representations instead of the standard multino-mial translation probability employed by FA. We do this using a modified version of the log-bilinear language model in place of the translation proba-bilities p ( f j | e i ) at the heart of the FA model. This allows us to learn word representations for both languages, a translation matrix relating these vec-tor spaces, as well as alignments at the same time.
Our modifications to the log-bilinear model are as follows. Where the original log-bilinear lan-guage model uses context words to predict the next word X  X his is simply the distributed extension of an n-gram language model X  X e use a word from the source language in a parallel sentence to pre-dict a target word. An additional aspect of our model, which demonstrates its flexibility, is that it is simple to include further context from the source sentence, such as words around the aligned word or syntactic and semantic annotations. In this pa-per we experiment with a transformed sum over k context words to each side of the aligned source word. We evaluate different context sizes and re-port the results in Section 5. We define the energy function for the translation probabilities to be
E( f,e i ) =  X  where r e source and target words e i + s  X  V E ,f  X  V F in their respective vocabularies, T s  X  R d  X  d is the transformation matrix for each surrounding con-text position, b r  X  R d are the representation bi-ases, and b f  X  R is a bias for each word f  X  V F .
The translation probability is given by p ( f | e i ) = 1 Z
In addition to these translation probabilities, we have parameterized the translation probabilities for the null word using a softmax over an addi-tional weight vector. 3.1 Class Factorization We improve training performance using a class factorization strategy (Morin and Bengio, 2005) as follows. We augment the translation probabil-is a unique predetermined class of f ; the class probability is modeled using a similar log-bilinear model as above, but instead of predicting a word representation r f we predict the class representa-tion r c add respective new context matrices and biases. Note that the probability of the word f depends on both the class and the given context words: it is normalized only over words in the class c f .
In our training we create classes based on word frequencies in the corpus as follows. Considering words in the order of their decreasing frequency, we add word types into a class until the total fre-quency of the word types in the currently consid-ered class is less than total tokens  X  less than class size affects the speed the most. The original FA model optimizes the likelihood using the expectation maximization (EM) algo-rithm where, in the M-step, the parameter update is analytically solvable, except for the  X  parameter (the diagonal tension), which is optimized using gradient descent (Dyer et al., 2013). We modified the implementations provided with CDEC (Dyer et al., 2010), retaining its default parameters.
In our model, DWA, we optimize the likelihood using the EM as well. However, while training we fix the counts of the E-step to those computed by FA, trained for the default 5 iterations, to aid the convergence rate, and optimize the M-step only. Let  X  be the parameters for our model. Then the gradient for each sentence is given by where the first part are the counts from the FA model and second part comes from our model.

We compute the gradient for the alignment probabilities in the same way as in the FA model, and the gradient for the translation probabilities using back-propagation (Rumelhart et al., 1986). For parameter update, we use A DA G RAD as the gradient descent algorithm (Duchi et al., 2011). We first evaluate the alignment error rate of our approach, which establishes the model X  X  ability to both learn alignments as well as word representa-tions that explain these alignments. Next, we use a cross-lingual document classification task to ver-ify that the representations are semantically useful. We also inspect the embedding space qualitatively to get some insight into the learned structure. 5.1 Alignment Evaluation We compare the alignments learned here with those of the F AST A LIGN model which produces very good alignments and translation BLEU scores. We use the same language pairs and datasets as in Dyer et al. (2013), that is the FBIS Chinese-English corpus, and the French-English section of the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005). We used the preprocessing tools from CDEC and fur-ther replaced all unique tokens with UNK. We trained our models with 100 dimensional repre-sentations for up to 40 iterations, and the FA model for 5 iterations as is the default.

Table 1 shows that our model learns alignments on part with those of the FA model. This is in line with expectation as our model was trained using the FA expectations. However, it confirms that the learned word representations are able to ex-plain translation probabilities. Surprisingly, con-text seems to have little impact on the alignment error, suggesting that the model receives sufficient information from the aligned words themselves. 5.2 Document Classification A standard task for evaluating cross-lingual word representations is document classification where training is performed in one and evaluation in an-other language. This tasks require semantically plausible embeddings (for classification) which are valid across two languages (for the semantic transfer). Hence this task requires more of the word embeddings than the previous task.
 Table 1: Alignment error rate (AER) compar-ison, in both directions, between the F AST A L -IGN (FA) alignment model and our model (DWA) with k context words (see Equation 1). Lower numbers indicate better performance.

We mainly follow the setup of Klementiev et al. (2012) and use the German-English parallel cor-pus of the European Parliament proceedings to train the word representations. We perform the classification task on the Reuters RCV1/2 corpus. Unlike Klementiev et al. (2012), we do not use that corpus during the representation learning phase. We remove all words occurring less than five times in the data and learn 40 dimensional word embed-dings in line with prior work.

To train a classifier on English data and test it on German documents we first project word rep-resentations from English into German: we select the most probable German word according to the learned translation probabilities, and then compute document representations by averaging the word representations in each document. We use these projected representations for training and subse-quently test using the original German data and representations. We use an averaged perceptron classifier as in prior work, with the number of epochs (3) tuned on a subset of the training set.
Table 2 shows baselines from previous work and classification accuracies. Our model outper-forms the model by Klementiev et al. (2012), and it also outperforms the most comparable models by Hermann and Blunsom (2014b) when training on German data and performs on par with it when learns more informative representations towards document classification, even without additional monolingual language models or context informa-tion. Again the impact of context is inconclusive. Table 2: Document classification accuracy when trained on 1,000 training examples of the RCV1/2 corpus (train  X  test). Baselines are the majority class, glossed, and MT (Klementiev et al., 2012). Further, we are comparing to Klementiev et al. (2012), BiCVM A DD (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014a), and BiCVM B I (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014b). k is the context size, see Equation 1. 5.3 Representation Visualization Following the document classification task we want to gain further insight into the types of fea-tures our embeddings learn. For this we visu-alize word representations using t-SNE projec-tions (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008). Fig-ure 1 shows an extract from our projection of the 2,000 most frequent German words, together with an expected representation of a translated English word given translation probabilities. Here, it is interesting to see that the model is able to learn related representations for words chair and rat-spr  X  asidentschaft (presidency) even though these words were not aligned by our model. Figure 2 shows an extract from the visualization of the 10,000 most frequent English words trained on an-other corpus. Here again, it is evident that the em-beddings are semantically plausible with similar words being closely aligned. We presented a new probabilistic model for learn-ing bilingual word representations. This dis-tributed word alignment model (DWA) learns both representations and alignments at the same time. We have shown that the DWA model is able to learn alignments on par with the F AST A LIGN alignment model which produces very good align-ments, thereby determining the efficacy of the learned representations which are used to calculate Figure 1: A visualization of the expected represen-tation of the translated English word chair among the nearest German words: words never aligned (green), and those seen aligned (blue) with it. Figure 2: A cluster of English words from the 10,000 most frequent English words visualized us-ing t-SNE. Word representations were optimized for p ( zh | en ) ( k = 0 ). word translation probabilities for the alignment task. Subsequently, we have demonstrated that our model can effectively be used to project doc-uments from one language to another. The word representations our model learns as part of the alignment process are semantically plausible and useful. We highlighted this by applying these em-beddings to a cross-lingual document classifica-tion task where we outperform prior work, achieve results on par with the current state of the art and provide new state-of-the-art results on one of the tasks. Having provided a probabilistic account of word representations across multiple languages, future work will focus on applying this model to machine translation and related tasks, for which previous approaches of learning such embeddings are less suited. Another avenue for further study is to combine this method with monolingual lan-guage models, particularly in the context of se-mantic transfer into resource-poor languages.
