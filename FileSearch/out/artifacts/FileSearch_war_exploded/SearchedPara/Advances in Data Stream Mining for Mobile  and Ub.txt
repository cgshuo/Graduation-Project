H.2.8 [ Database Management ]: Database Applications  X  Data Mining Algorithms Data Stream Mining, Mobile Co mputing, Ubiquitous Computing The phenomenal growth of mobile devices coupled with their ever-increasing computational capacity presents an exciting new opportunity for real-time, intelligent data analysis in mobile and ubiquitous environments. Ubiquitous /Mobile data mining refers to the process of performing data st ream mining using mobile and/or embedded devices (e.g. sensors) to support critical applications such as mobile healthcare, intelligent transportation systems, mobile activity recognition, smar t homes, and emergency/disaster management like bushfires [1, 2]. Thus, the key focus is on developing data stream mining algorithms that are highly scalable/computationally efficient, energy-efficient, and context/resource-aware. These f eatures enable the continued operation of data stream mining algorithms in a highly dynamic mobile/ubiquitous environment. The typical constraints that have to be addressed in performing mobile/ubiquitous data stream mi ning are: (1) data streams are generated and sent in real-time in a stream format with little or no potential for persistent storage, (2) resource constraints include limited computational resources such as memory, processor speed, network bandwidth, battery power, and screen real-estate, (3) temporal constraints refer to real-time information and decision-making needs that, in turn, necessitate the analysis to be online, incremental and continuous, (4) mobility of users and devices and the connectivity issues thereof, and (5) adaptation and context-awareness of the analysis process to varying/dynamically changing resource-levels and user needs. In the last few years, rapid strides have been made in accurately and efficiently mining high speed data streams in mobile devices such smart phones] and there is a growing focus on  X  X n-network X  processing using embedded devices such as se nsor nodes. These techniques leverage the body of work that ex ists in mining data streams and aim to enable the operation of these algorithms in resource-constrained environments. There is also an emerging focus on context-aware data stream mining which targets the learning process to be aware of its opera tional and application constraints and self-adapt according to changing situations/needs. The body of work in mobile/ubiquitous data stream mining ranges from mobile/ubiquitous environments, sy stems/toolkits for mobile data mining and innovative/new applications. The tutorial is organized as follows. We will present the fundamental techniques for data st ream analysis such as change detection, clustering, classifica tion, frequent patterns, and time series analysis from distributed da ta streams. We will present the critical factors that need to be considered in order to develop and deploy data stream mining in mobile/ubiquitous environments including the need for adaptation and context/situation-aware reasoning. We will then present state-of-the-art algorithms for mobile data stream mining, including the emerging topic of Pocket Data Mining (PDM), focusing on ad hoc distributed data stream mining in mobile environments. The tutorial will also present the Open Mobile Miner (OMM) toolkit [3] for rapid deployment of mobile data stream mining and real-world application/case studies and demons trations to stimulate the real need for this growing research fi eld. Finally the tutorial will be concluded with open issues and future directions.
