 Statistical machine translation (SMT) relies on par-allel corpus. Aside from collecting parallel cor-pus, we have seen interesting research on automat-ically generating corpus from existing resources. Typical examples are paraphrasing using bilingual (Callison-Burch et al., 2006) or monolingual (Quirk et al., 2004) data. In this paper, we propose a dif-ferent methodology of generating additional parallel corpus. The basic idea of paraphrasing is to find al-ternative ways that convey the same information . In contrast, we propose to build new parallel sen-tences that convey different information , yet retain correct grammatical and semantic structures.
The basic idea of the proposed method is to sub-stitute source and target phrase pairs in a sentence pair with phrase pairs from other sentences. The problem is how to identify where a substitution should happen and which phrase pairs are valid can-didates for the substitution. While syntactical con-straints have been proven to helpful in identifying good paraphrases (Callison-Burch, 2008), it is in-sufficient in our task because it cannot properly filter the candidates for the replacement. If we allow all the NPs to be replaced with other NPs, each sen-tence pair can generate huge number of new sen-tences. Instead, we resort to Semantic Role Labeling (Palmer et al., 2005) to provide more lexicalized and semantic constraints to select the candidates. The method only requires running SRL labeling on ei-ther side of the language pair, and that enables ap-plications on low resource languages. Even with the SRL constraints, the generated corpus may still be large and noisy. Hence, we apply an additional fil-tering stage on the generated corpus. We used an SVM classifier with features derived from standard phrase based translation models and bilingual lan-guage models to identify high quality sentence pairs, and use these sentence pairs in the SMT training. In the remaining part of the paper, we introduce the ap-proach and present experimental results on Chinese-to-English translation tasks, which showed improve-ments across 5 NIST test sets. The objective of the method is to generate new syn-tactically and semantically well-formed parallel sen-tences from existing corpus. To achieve this, we first collect a set of rules as the candidates for the substi-tution. We also need to know where we should put in the replacements and whether the resulting sentence pairs are grammatical.

First, standard word alignment and phrase extrac-tion are performed on existing corpus. Afterwards, we apply an SRL labeler on either the source or tar-get language, whichever has a better SRL labeler. Third, we extract SRL substitution rules (SSRs) from the corpus. The rules carry information of se-mantic frames, semantic roles, and corresponding source and target phrases. Fourth, we replace phrase pairs in existing sentences with the SSR if they have the same semantic frames and semantic roles.
The newly generated sentence pairs will pass through a classifier to determine whether they are acceptable parallel sentences. And, finally, we train MT system using the new corpus. The resulting phrase table can either be used directly in translation tasks or be interpolated with baseline phrase tables. Swapping phrase pairs that serve as the same seman-tic role of the same semantic frame can provide more combinations of words and phrases. Figure 1 shows an example. The phrase pair  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  Xinjiang X  X  Yili will hold X  would not be observed in the original corpus without substitution. In this pa-per, we call a tuple of semantic frame and semantic role a semantic signature . Two phrase pairs with the same semantic signature are considered valid substi-tutions of each other.

The extraction of SSRs is similar to the well-known phrase extraction algorithm (Och and Ney, 2004). The criteria of a phrase pair to be included in the SSR set are 1 :  X  The phrase on side A must cover a whole se- X  The phrase on side B must not contain words  X  Both of the two boundary words on side B
Utilizing these rules, we can perform the sentence generation process. For each semantic structure of each sentence, 2 we determine the phrase pair to be replaced by the same criteria as mention above, and search for suitable SSRs with the same semantic sig-nature. Finally, we replace the original phrases with the source and target side phrases given by the SSRs. Notice that for each new sentence generated, we al-low for application of only one substitution.
Although the idea is straightforward, we face two problems in practice. First, for frequent semantic frames, the number of substitution candidates can be very large. It will generate many new sentence pairs, and can easily exceed the capacity of our system. To deal with the problem, we pre-filter the SSRs so that each semantic signature is associated with no more than 100 SSRs. As we can see from the cri-teria for extracting SSRs, all the entries in the SSR rule set satisfies the commonly used phrase extrac-tion heuristics. Therefore, the set of SSRs is a subset of the phrase table. Because of this, We use the fea-tures in the phrase table to sort the rules, and keep 100 rules with highest the arithmetic mean of the feature values.

The second problem is the phrase boundaries are often inaccurate. To handle this problem, we use a simple  X  X lue X  algorithm during the substitution. If the inserted phrase has a prefix or suffix sub-phrase that is the same as the suffix or prefix of the adjacent parts of the original sentence, then the duplication will be removed. We can expect the generated corpus be noisy, and needs to be filtered. In this paper we use an SVM classifier to perform this task. First we label a set of sentence pairs 3 randomly sampled from the gener-ated data. We ask the following questions: 1. Are the two sentences grammatical, especially 2. Are the two sentences still parallel?
If both questions have positive answers, we label the sentence pair as positive. We can then use the la-bels together with the features to train the classifier. It is worth mentioning that when we say  X  X rammat-ical X , we do not care about the validity of the actual meaning of the sentence.
 The set of SSR is a subset of the phrase table. Therefore, the features in the phrase table can be used as features. It includes the bidirectional phrase and lexicon translation probabilities.
 In addition, we use the language model features. The language model score of the whole sentence is useless because it is dominated by words not af-fected by the substitution. Therefore, we only con-sider n-grams that are affected by the substitution. I.e. only the boundary words are taken into account. Given an n -gram language model, we only calculate the scores in windows with the size 2 n  X  2 , centered on the boundary of the substituted phrases. In other words, n  X  1 words before and after the boundaries will be included in the calculation.

Finally, there are two additional features: the probability of observing the source/target phrase given the semantic signature. They can be calculated by counting the frequencies of source/target phrases and the semantic signature in extracted rules.
As we have abundant sentence pairs generated, we prefer to apply a more harsh filtering, keeping only the best candidates. Therefore, when training the SVM model, we intentionally increase the cost of false positive errors, so as to maximize the pre-cision rate of positive decisions and reduce possible contamination. In an experiment, we used 900 of the 1000 labeled sentence pairs as the training set, and the remaining 100 (41 positive and 59 negative samples) sentence pairs as the test set. By setting the cost of false positive errors to 1.33, we classified 20 of 41 positive samples correctly, and only 3 of the 59 negative samples are classified as positive. With the generated corpus, we perform training and generate a new phrase table. There are many ways of utilizing the new phrase table; the simplest way is to use it directly for translation tasks. However, the new phrase table may be noisier than the original one. To solve this, we interpolate the new phrase ta-ble with the baseline phrase table. If a phrase pair is only observed in the baseline phrase table, we keep it intact in the interpolated phrase table. If a phrase pair is observed only in the new phrase table, we discount all the feature values by a factor of 2. And if the phrase pair is in both of the phrase tables, the feature values will be the arithmetic mean of the cor-responding values in the two phrase tables.

We also noticed that the new corpus may have very different distribution of words comparing to the baseline corpus. The word alignment process us-ing generative models is more likely to be affected by the radical change of distributions. Therefore, we also experimented with force aligning the gener-ated corpus with the word alignment models trained baseline corpus before building the phrase table. We performed experiments on Chinese to English MT tasks with the proposed approach. The base-line system is trained on the FBIS corpus, the statis-tics of the corpus is shown in Table 1. We adopted the ASSERT English SRL labeler (Pradhan et al., 2004), which was trained on PropBank data us-ing SVM classifier. The labeler reports 81.87% precision and 73.21% recall rate on CoNLL-2005 shared task on SRL. We aligned the parallel sen-tences with MGIZA(Gao and Vogel, 2008), and per-formed experiments with the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al, 2007).

The rule extraction algorithm produces 1.3 mil-lion SSRs. As we can observe in Table 1, we gener-ated 29.6 million sentences from the 387K sentence pairs, and by using the SVM-based classifier, we fil-ter the corpus down to 7.2 million. We also observed that the average sentence length increases by 15% in the generated corpus. That is because longer sen-tences have more slots for substitution. Therefore, they have more occurrences in the generated corpus.
We used the NIST MT06 test set for tuning, and experimented with 5 test sets, including MT02, 03, 04, 05, 08. Table 2 shows the BLEU and TER scores of the experiments. As we can see in the results, by using only the generated sentence pairs, the per-formance of the system drops. However the inter-polated phrase tables outperform the baseline. On average, the improvements on all the 5 test sets are 0.45 on BLEU score and -1.22 on TER when using the interpolated phrase table. We do observe MT08 drops on BLEU scores; however, the TER scores are consistently improved across all the test sets. When using baseline alignment model, we observe a quite different phenomenon. In this case, interpolat-ing the phrase tables no longer show improvements. However, using the generated corpus alone achieves -1.80 on average TER. An explanation is that us-ing identical alignment model makes the phrases ex-tracted from the baseline and generated corpus sim-ilar, which undermines the idea of interpolating two phrase tables. As shown in Table 3, it generates less new source phrases and 10% more phrase pairs that overlaps with the baseline phrase table. For com-parison, we also provide scores from a system that uses the training data for GALE project, which has 8.7M sentence pairs 4 . In Table 3 we observe that the large GALE system yields better BLEU results while the IT or GA systems have even better TER scores than the GALE system. The expanded cor-pus performs almost as well as the GALE system even though the large system has a phrase table that is four time larger.

The statistics of the phrase tables and translation outputs are listed in Table 3. As we can see, the generated sentence introduces a large number of new source phrases and the average lengths of matching source phrases of all the systems are longer than the baseline, which could be an evidence for our claim that the proposed approach can generate more high quality sentences and phrase pairs that have not been observed in the original corpus. In this paper we explore a novel way of generating new parallel corpus from existing SRL labeled cor-pus. By extracting SRL substitution rules (SSRs) we generate a large set of sentence pairs, and by apply-ing an SVM-based classifier we can filter the corpus, keeping only grammatical sentence pairs. By inter-polating the phrase table with the baseline phrase ta-ble, we observed improvement on Chinese-English machine translation tasks and the performance is comparable to system trained with larger manually collected parallel corpus. While our experiments were performed on Chinese-English, the approach is more useful for low resource languages. The advan-tage of the proposed method is that we only need the SRL labels on either side of the language pair, and we can choose the one with a better SRL labeler.
The features we used in the paper are still prim-itive, which results in a classifier radically tuned against false positive rate. This can be improved by designing more informative features.

Since the method will only introduce new phrases across the phrase boundaries of phrases in existing phrase table, it is desirable to be integrated with other paraphrasing approaches to further increase the coverage of the generated corpus.
