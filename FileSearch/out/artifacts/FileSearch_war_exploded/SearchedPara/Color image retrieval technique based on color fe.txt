 1. Introduction
Image retrieval has been a very active research topic since the 1970s. Most convenient image retrieval schemes are annotated-based that annotate each image in an image database by using keywords for similar keywords for each image is time-consuming. The second problem is that different people may give the same solve the problems of the annotated-based image retrieval methods. In a CBIR system, images are automat-shape, texture, color, size, and so on.

Many researchers used color feature to depict image contents for region matching, semantic categoriza-2001; Wang &amp; Du, 2001 ). For example, in 1996, Gong et al. proposed an image indexing and retrieval ( Kou, 2001 ).

In 2003, Chan and Liu proposed a CBIR system based on color differences on edges in spiral scan order local features of an image.

In this paper, we adopt another local feature, image bitmap, to investigate similar image from the huge database. The image bitmap is obtained from an image compressed with the block truncation coding method. instead of numerous image features. 2. Related works
Swain and Ballard (1991) proposed an image indexing scheme based on color histogram in 1991. In their images from the database. In order to reduce the memory space for storing the histogram, they reduce the their scheme, a color image is transformed to three spectrums, H, S and V. The scheme, then, calculated the three statistic moments for each spectrum. The nine moments obtained from the three spectrums are the features of the image.

In Chan and Liu (2003) and Chang and Chan (2000) used color differences on edges in spiral scan order is shown in Fig. 1 .

 effectiveness of the CBIR scheme. 3. The block truncation coding method
Many image compression methods have been proposed to reduce the size of the image. The block trunca-tion coding method is one of the efficient image compression methods. The block truncation coding method resent the pixel. Otherwise, the scheme used  X  X 1 X  X  to represent the pixel.
 block. The mean value of the block is approximately equal to 79.125, and the standard deviation is about map of the block is shown in Fig. 3 .
 4. The proposed method
This paper uses two features, the color distribution and image bitmap, to represent an image. 4.1. The color distribution feature in this paper are the mean values and the standard deviations of images.
 In the proposed scheme, each pixel of a color image is represented by a vector where P i is the i th pixel of the image, 1 6 i 6 M , the size of the image is M and the components of P RGB components of the color image.

The mean value ( l ) and the standard deviation ( r ) of the color image are determined as follows: respectively, where l  X  feature to describe the local characteristics of the image. 4.2. The image bitmap feature the mean value for each block. Let l B where l B In the third step, the scheme compares the mean values of the block l to determine the characterization of the block B j for generating the image bitmap. Let T  X  image bitmap of the image. Each component in T is expressed as TR =( TR
TG =( TG 1 , TG 2 , ... , TG m ), and TB =( TB 1 , TB 2 , ... , TB respectively given by all feature of the image is ( l , r , T ). 4.3. The similarity measure of the features of the image is normalized by using where a the average value of whole l in the database that is given by a  X  1 whole l that is given by c  X  1 by using where b is the average value of whole r in the database that is given by b  X  1 deviation of the y th image, and s is the standard deviation of whole r that is given by s  X  1 For two given images A and B , the hamming distance used to evaluate the similarity is defined by follows: where l 0 A z is the normalized mean value of the image A in z color space, meanwhile, r similar to the query image. 5. Experiments and results
The proposed scheme was developed on an AMD 1.4 GHz personal computer with 512 RAM. Three existing 5.1. The retrieval accuracy mations ( Chan &amp; Liu, 2003 ). We divided the database into two sets, the query set Q where each set has 400 animations. Each image in Q 1 has a corresponding image in D of Q 1 are shown in Fig. 4 (a) and its corresponding target images in D set Q 2 and the target set D 2 . Each image in Q 2 has a corresponding image in D of Q 2 and its corresponding images in D 2 are shown in Fig. 5 (b).

The scheme treated each image in the query sets Q 1 and Q tances arranged in an ascending order. The number of retrieved images is N the target image.
 The retrieval accuracy of the method is given by the expression from the answer set and j Q j is the total number of images in the query set. of the proposed scheme with bitmap sized 15  X  15. In addition, the memory space of the bitmap sized assigned as 5  X  5 and 10  X  10.
