 Trust plays a very important role in the Online Social Network (OSN) and E-commerce applications, especially when the user encounters unfamiliar people or products. Epinions.com is a such consumer reviews web site that helps users make informed buying decisions by the Web of Trust . Trust inference based on trust transitivity considers that people X  X  trust can be relayed along the trust propagation paths with the consistent trust scope. How to accurately discount and fuse the user X  X  trust along these paths emerges as a question.

Most existing trust discounting operators [1,5,2] actually utilize the structure balance theory principles, under the assumption that the triangle relationships in the social network are all balanced. However, the triads in the real world are not all balanced and it may lead to inaccurate trust discounting. The fusion of independent and dependent trust are discussed in [5]. However, the recom-menders X  conflicts on observations are not distinguishable during the trust fusion operation for dependent opinions in practice, because the observations are al-ready discounted in the previous trust discounting. In order to solve these issues, we first illustrate the distribution regularities of the balanced triads and propose the adaptive trust discounting operator. Then, the situation that different rec-ommenders have conflicting judgements on the same observations is discussed and the partial dependent trust fusion operator is proposed to fuse the trust opinions in a practical way. The research on trust discounting and trust fusion attracts much attention. Gol-beck [1] proposed TidalTrust to personalize applications through integration of inferred trust. The indirect trust is deduced by a weighted sum of the witnesses X  trusts about the target, taking the source user X  X  trusts about the witnesses as the weights. J X sang et al. [5] analyzed different trust discounting operators and fusion operators with the subjective logic. The trust fusion operator for depen-dent and independent opinions are also proposed to deduce the opinion of a user combination about the target user. But the shared observations can not be distinguishable in the trust fusion, which leads to the trust fusion operator unpractical. Based on the subjective logic, Hang et al. [2] proposed the Con-catenation, Aggregation and Selection operators to propagate and fuse trust in social networks. The trust discounting operations mentioned above are mainly consistent with the structure balance theory under the assumption that all triads are balanced, but they ignore that triads are not all balanced in fact.
There are also novel trust operators based on other theories. Victor et al. [10,9] built a trust model based on bilattice theo ry and proposed different trust score propagation and aggregation operators with t-norms and t-conorms. Zhang et al. [11] considered that the trust evaluation is similar to the physical measurement, which increases the measurement accura cy by combining different measurement methods, or repeating the measurement. They also proposed the trust metrics and trust operators to propagate and aggregate trust based on measurement theory and error propagation theory. This paper follows J X sang X  X  work [5] to model trust with the subjective logic and discusses the trust discounting operator and the trust fusion operator for the trust opinions . 3.1 Structure Balance Based Adaptive Trust Discounting The structure balance theory [3] considers that balanced triads are more plausi-ble and prevalent than the unbalanced triads in social networks. The transitive triad cases t 1 , t 2 , t 5 and t 6 (shown in Fig.1) are investigated in [7], because they are consistent with the intuition of recommendation. Based on the structure bal-ance theory, we can derive A  X  X  relationship with X by the recommender B and the dashed relation in t 1 can be derived as a positive r elation, according to the principle 1) X  X he friend of my friend is also my friend X . The rest cases correspond with the principles 2) X  X he enemy of my friend is my enemy X , 3) X  X he friend of my enemy is my enemy X  X nd 4)  X  X he enemy of my enemy is my friend X  respectively.
However, the triads are not all balanced in reality and there is a negative cor-relation between the distribution of the Balanced Transitive Triad Percentage (BTTP) and the edge uncertainties of the triads [7]. According to the statistics, nearly half of the transitive triads for t 2 ,t 5 and t 6 cases are not balanced, which means that for example the enemy of my friend is probably my friend. Without any priori knowledge of the distribution of the balanced transitive triads, the ex-isting trust discounting operators are risking the misuse of the structure balance theory for t 2 ,t 5 and t 6 cases at the probability nearly 50%. Definition 1. Adaptive Trust Discounting Operator Let A, B and X be three users, the trust opinions of A and B about the competence of B and X be expressed as  X  A B and  X  B X . The adaptive trust discounted opinion where the number of the deduced A X  X  observations about X can be here  X  ,  X  ,  X  and  X  are the balance confidence factors of the t 1 , t 6 , t 2 and t 5 .
The distributions of the balance confidence factors are obtained by building in Fig.2) to approach the surfaces of BTTP distribution shown in [7]. For the given three users ( A , B and X ), the balance confidence factors vary according to the edge uncertainties ( u A B and u B X ) and the proposed ATD operator adjusts the utilization rate of the mentioned principles for the four cases. 3.2 Trust Fusion for Partial Dependent Opinions Given the source and target user ( S and T ) and multiple recommenders R i (1  X  i  X  m ) as shown in Fig.3, we want to infer S  X  X  trust opinion about T by the recommenders. Different recomme nders may have different judgements on the same observation (the shared black dot in Fig.3) and their opinions are called dependent opinions. Note the set of R i  X  X  observations on T as O ( R i )and 0 means that R i may take o j as a positive response or a negative one.
The observations which share the same recommender(s) are classified into a new set of observations O k and  X  = { O k | 1  X  k  X  p } is a partition of O ,here p is the number of the observation sets. Then each O k is assigned with a virtual recommender R k . For the set of observations that share only one recommender, there is no conflicting judgements on observations and the source user X  X  opinion about the corresponding virtual recommender is identical to his opinion about the recommender. For the example in Fig.3,  X  S R observations O k that share multiple recommenders { R  X  i | 1  X  i  X  n } here n is the number of the shared recommenders, the source user X  X  opinion about the corresponding virtual recommender R k , i.e.  X  S R c by the weighted average opinion of  X  S R 1 and  X  S R 2 . Furthermore, the number of the virtual recommender X  X  observations about the target can be and the corresponding opinion  X  R k T can be obtained by Eq.(1).
 Definition 2. Partial Dependent Trust Fusion Operator Let S and T be the source and target users, { R i } (1  X  i  X  m ) be the set of recom-menders who have direct observations O ( R i ) about T with conflicting judgements and the opinion of S about recommender R i be  X  S R tial dependent trust fused opinion of S about T by recommenders { R i } can be denoted ommenders and  X  is the Consensus Operator for Independent Opinions in [5].
The PDTF operator first regards the recommenders who share the same obser-vation set as a virtual recommender. Then, the source user X  X  trust opinion about the virtual recommenders and the virtual recommenders X  trust opinions about the target user are obtained and concatenated by the trust discounting operator. Finally, the virtual recommenders share no observations and the trust opinions of the source user about the target user via multiple virtual recommenders are fused as independent trust opinions. Comparative experiments are carried on the Epinions data set [8] to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed trust discounting and fusion operators over the representative existing work (J X sang [4,5], Hang [2], Zhang [11] and Victor [10,9]) on trust inference accura cy. The random walk based sampling method [6] is used to scale down the extended Epinions data set (available at trustlet.org) and there are 33036 users who issued 84141 trust and distrust statements. 4.1 Methodology and Metrics Given a pair of arbitrary users ( A and B ), we regard the number of the A  X  X  ratings on B  X  X  articles as the number of observations (noted as n rating  X  0) and compute the mean rating (noted as m rating  X  [1 , 5]). For each article written by 2000 edges are randomly chosen from the data set as samples and each edge is associated with the source and target users. The cross validation technique Leave-one-out is utilized. We first remove one sample edge and find multiple paths connecting the user pair (total number of the paths found is 230089). Then, 1) infer the source vertex X  X  opinion about the target  X  along the trust operation but different trust fusion operations  X  are applied to deduce  X  by  X  T =  X  with one trust inference path to avoid the mass hysteria [5]. For the both parts,  X  is compared with the opinion  X  mapped by the ground truth (Eq.(5)) in terms of E-error ( E  X  error (  X , X  )= | ( b + u  X  a )  X  ( b + u  X  a ) | ) and B-error ( B  X  error (  X , X  )= | b  X  b | ) [2] for trust inference accuracy evaluation. 4.2 Results and Analysis The overall MAEs (Mean Absolute Errors) of E-error and B-error for the trust inference with different trust operators are given in the Table 1. While, the partial MAEs are plotted from differen t perspectives for further analysis. (1) Trust Discounting Operation. J X sang(o1) (Uncertainty Favouring Dis-counting operator in [5]), J X sang(o2) (Opposite Belief Favouring Discounting op-erator in [5]), Hang (Concatenation operator in [2]), Zhang (Transitive operator in [11]), Victor (Propagation operator in [9] which shows the best performance) and the proposed ATD operator are compared in terms of MAEs of B-error and E-error. Fig.4 shows that the trust inference with most trust discounting opera-tors becomes inaccurate as the path lengt h increases. However, the B-error and E-error of the proposed ATD are insensitive to the path length and they are the lowest among the six operators. The overall MAEs of B-error and E-error of ATD (0.1943 and 0.1048 shown in Table 1 are also the lowest, which are 46.6% and 44.9% lower than Hang X  X  0.3637 and 0.1902. (2) Trust Fusion Operation. J X sang&amp;Hang (Consensus operator for indepen-dent opinions in [5] or Aggregation operator in [2], which are the same), Zhang (Aggregation operator in [11]), Victor ( KAAV 2 in [9]), PDTF(belief)(taking be-lief as confidence) and PDTF(cert.)(taking certainty as confidence) are compared in terms of MAEs of B-error and E-error. Fig.5 shows that the deviations of the trust inference float as the number of witness increases. It means that more wit-nesses do not lead to more accurate trust i nference, which is consistent with the phenomenon in [10]. The main reason is that the trust scopes are coarse grained and we even can not differentiate the referral trust and functional trust in the data set. As shown in Table 1, the proposed PDTF(cert.) and PDTF(belief) op-erators yield the lowest overall MAEs of B-error and E-error (0.2041 and 0.1143) among the five trust fusion operators, which are 7.4% and 5.0% lower than the closest J X sang&amp;Hang X  X  0.2205 and 0.1203. The proposed adaptive trust discounting operator can adjust the utilization of structure balance theory principles according to the distribution of the balanced transitive triads. The partial dependent trust fusion operator is also given to con-sider recommenders X  conflicting judgements and it can handle this issue in a prac-tical way. Comparative experiments on rea l data set demonstrate the superiority of the proposed trust operators on trust inference accuracy. For future work, we will discuss how to efficiently apply the trust operators to multiple trust inference path with shared edges and avoid the mass hysteria in the trust aggregation. Acknowledgment.
