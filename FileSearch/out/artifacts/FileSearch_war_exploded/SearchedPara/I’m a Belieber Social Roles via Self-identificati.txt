 With the rise of social media, researchers have sought to induce models for predicting latent au-thor attributes such as gender, age, and politi-cal preferences (Garera and Yarowsky, 2009; Rao et al., 2010; Burger et al., 2011; Van Durme, 2012b; Zamal et al., 2012). Such models are clearly in line with the goals of both computa-tional advertising (Wortman, 2008) and the grow-ing area of computational social science (Conover et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2011; Paul and Dredze, 2011; Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Moham-mad et al., 2013) where big data and computa-tion supplement methods based on, e.g., direct hu-man surveys. For example, Eisenstein et al. (2010) demonstrated a model that predicted where an au-thor was located in order to analyze regional dis-tinctions in communication. While some users ex-plicitly share their GPS coordinates through their Twitter clients, having a larger collection of au-tomatically identified users within a region was preferable even though the predictions for any given user were uncertain.

We show that media such as Twitter can sup-port classification that is more fine-grained than gender or general location. Predicting social roles such as doctor , teacher , vegetarian , christian , may open the door to large-scale passive surveys of public discourse that dwarf what has been pre-viously available to social scientists. For exam-ple, work on tracking the spread of flu infections across Twitter (Lamb et al., 2013) might be en-hanced with a factor based on aggregate predic-tions of author occupation.

We present two studies showing that first-person social content (tweets) contains intuitive signals for such fine-grained roles. We argue that non-trivial classifiers may be constructed based purely on leveraging simple linguistic patterns. These baselines suggest a wide range of author categories to be explored further in future work. Study 1 In the first study, we seek to determine whether such a signal exists in self-identification : we rely on variants of a single pattern,  X  I am a  X , to bootstrap data for training balanced-class binary classifiers using unigrams observed in tweet con-tent. As compared to prior research that required actively polling users for ground truth in order to construct predictive models for demographic in-formation (Kosinski et al., 2013), we demonstrate that some users specify such properties publicly through direct natural language.

Many of the resultant models show intuitive strongly-weighted features, such as a writer be-ing likely to tweet about a story , or an ath-lete discussing a game . This demonstrates self-identification as a viable signal in building predic-tive models of social roles. Study 2 In the second study we exploit a com-plementary signal based on characteristic con-ceptual attributes of a social role, or concept class (Schubert, 2002; Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004; Pas  X ca and Van Durme, 2008). We identify typical attributes of a given social role by collect-ing terms in the Google n-gram corpus that occur frequently in a possessive construction with that role. For example, with the role doctor we extract terms matching the simple pattern  X  doctor X  X   X . All role-representative users were drawn from the free public 1% sample of the Twitter Fire-hose, over the period 2011-2013, from the sub-set that selected English as their native language (85,387,204 unique users). To identify users of a particular role, we performed a case-agnostic search of variants of a single pattern: I am a(n) , and I X  X  a(n) , where all single tokens filling the slot were taken as evidence of the author self-reporting for the given  X  X ole X . Example tweets can be seen in Table 1, examples of frequency per role in Table 2. This resulted in 63,858 unique roles
We manually selected a set of roles for fur-ther exploration, aiming for a diverse sample across: occupation (e.g., doctor , teacher ), family ( mother ), disposition ( pessimist ), religion ( chris-tian ), and  X  X ollowers X  ( belieber , directioner ). 2 We filtered users via language ID (Bergsma et al.,
For each selected role, we randomly sampled up to 500 unique self-reporting users and then queried Twitter for up to 200 of their recent publicly tative content for that role, with any tweet match-ing the self-reporting patterns filtered. Three sets of background populations were extracted based on randomly sampling users that self-reported En-glish (post-filtered via LID).

Twitter users are empowered to at any time delete, rename or make private their accounts. Any given user taken to be representative based on a previously posted tweet may no longer be avail-able to query on. As a hint of the sort of user stud-ies one might explore given access to social role prediction, we see in Figure 1 a correlation be-tween self-reported role and the chance of an ac-count still being publicly visible, with roles such as belieber and directioner on the one hand, and doctor and teacher on the other.

The authors examined the self-identifying tweet of 20 random users per role. The accuracy of the self-identification pattern varied across roles and is attributable to various factors including quotes, e.g. @StarTrek Jim, I X  X  a DOCTOR not a down-load! . While these samples are small (and thus estimates of quality come with wide variance), it is noteworthy that a non-trivial number for each were judged as actually self-identifying.
 Indicative Language Most work in user clas-sification relies on featurizing language use, most simply through binary indicators recording whether a user did or did not use a particular word in a history of n tweets. To explore whether lan-guage provides signal for future work in fine-grain social role prediction, we constructed a set of ex-periments, one per role, where training and test sets were balanced between users from a random background sample and self-reported users. Base-line accuracy in these experiments was thus 50% .
Each training set had a target of 600 users (300 background, 300 self-identified); for those roles with less than 300 users self-identifying, all users were used, with an equal number background. We used the Jerboa (Van Durme, 2012a) platform to convert data to binary feature vectors over a un-igram vocabulary filtered such that the minimum frequency was 5 (across unique users). Training and testing was done with a log-linear model via LibLinear (Fan et al., 2008). We used the pos-itively annotated data to form test sets, balanced with data from the background set. Each test set had a theoretical maximum size of 40, but for sev-eral classes it was in the single digits (see Fig-ure 2). Despite the varied noisiness of our simple pattern-bootstrapped training data, and the small size of our annotated test set, we see in Figure 3 that we are able to successfully achieve statisti-cally significant predictions of social role for the majority of our selected examples.

Table 3 highlights examples of language indica-tive of role, as determined by the most positively weighted unigrams in the classification experi-ment. These results qualitatively suggest many roles under consideration may be teased out from a background population by focussing on language that follows expected use patterns. For example the use of the term game by athletes, studio by artists, mixtape by rappers, or jesus by Christians. Bergsma and Van Durme (2013) showed that the task of mining attributes for conceptual classes can relate straightforwardly to author attribute predic-tion. If one views a role, in their case gender, as two conceptual classes, male and female , then ex-isting attribute extraction methods for third-person content (e.g., news articles) can be cheaply used to create a set of bootstrapping features for building classifiers over first-person content (e.g., tweets). For example, if we learn from news corpora that: a man may have a wife , then a tweet saying: ...my wife... can be taken as potential evidence of mem-bership in the male conceptual class.

In our second study, we test whether this idea extends to our wider set of fine-grained roles. For example, we aimed to discover that a doctor may have a patient , while a hairdresser may have a salon ; these properties can be expressed in first-person content as possessives like my patient or my salon . We approached this task by selecting target roles from the first experiment and ranking charac-teristic attributes for each using pointwise mutual information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990).
First, we counted all terms matching a target social role X  X  possessive pattern (e.g., doctor X  X  ) in the web-scale n-gram corpus Google V2 (Lin et al., 2010) 5 . We ranked the collected terms by computing PMI between classes and attribute terms. Probabilities were estimated from counts of the class-attribute pairs along with counts match-ing the generic possessive patterns his and her which serve as general background cate-gories. Following suggestions by Bergsma and We removed attributes that were either (a) not nominal, or (b) not indicative of the social role. This left fewer than 30 attribute terms per role, with many roles having fewer than 10.

We next performed a precision test to identify potentially useful attributes in these lists. We ex-amined tweets with a first person possessive pat-tern for each attribute term from a small corpus of tweets collected over a single month in 2013, discarding those attribute terms with no positive matches. This precision test is useful regardless of how attribute lists are generated. The attribute term chart , for example, had high PMI with doc-tor ; but a precision test on the phrase my chart yielded a single tweet which referred not to a med-ical chart but to a top ten list (prompting removal of this attribute). Using this smaller high-precision set of attribute terms, we collected tweets from the Twitter Firehose over the period 2011-2013. Attribute terms are less indicative overall than self-ID, e.g., the phrase I X  X  a barber is a clearer signal than my scissors . We therefore include a role verification step in curating a collection of positively identified users. We use the crowd-whether the person tweeting held a given role Tweets were judged 5-way redundantly. Me-chanical Turk judges ( X  X urkers X ) were presented with a tweet and the prompt: Based on this tweet, would you think this person is a B AR -BER /H AIRDRESSER ? along with four response options: Yes , Maybe , Hard to tell , and No .
We piloted this labeling task on 10 tweets per attribute term over a variety of classes. Each an-swer was associated with a score (Yes = 1, Maybe = .5, Hard to tell = No = 0) and aggregated across the five judges. We found in development that an aggregate score of 4.0 (out of 5.0) led to an ac-ceptable agreement rate between the Turkers and the experimenters, when the tweets were randomly sampled and judged internally. We found that making conceptual class assignments based on a single tweet was often a subtle task. The results of this labeling study are shown in Figure 4, which gives the percent of tweets per attribute that were 4.0 or above. Attribute terms shown in red were manually discarded as being inaccurate (low on the y-axis) or non-prevalent (small shape).
From the remaining attribute terms, we identi-fied users with tweets scoring 4.0 or better as posi-tive examples of the associated roles. Tweets from those users were scraped via the Twitter API to construct corpora for each role. These were split intro train and test, balanced with data from the same background set used in the self-ID study.
Test sets were usually of size 40 (20 positive, 20 background), with a few classes being sparse (the smallest had only 16 instances). Results are shown in Figure 5. Several classes in this balanced setup can be predicted with accuracies in the 70-90% range, supporting our claim that there is discrimi-nating content for a variety of these social roles. Conditional Classification How accurately we can predict membership in a given class when a Twitter user sends a tweet matching one of the tar-geted attributes? For example, if one sends a tweet saying my coach , then how likely is it that author is an athlete ?
Using the same collection as the previous ex-periment, we trained classifiers conditioned on a given attribute term. Positive instances were taken to be those with a score of 4.0 or higher, with neg-ative instances taken to be those with scores of 1.0 or lower (strong agreement by judges that the orig-inal tweet did not provide evidence of the given role). Classification results are shown in Figure 6. We have shown that Twitter contains sufficiently robust signal to support more fine-grained au-thor attribute prediction tasks than have previously been attempted. Our results are based on simple, intuitive search patterns with minimal additional filtering: this establishes the feasibility of the task, but leaves wide room for future work, both in the sophistication in methodology as well as the diver-sity of roles to be targeted. We exploited two com-plementary types of indicators: self-identification and self-possession of conceptual class (role) at-tributes. Those interested in identifying latent de-mographics can extend and improve these indica-tors in developing ways to identify groups of inter-est within the general population of Twitter users.
