 The overabundance of scientific article information has cre-ated much inconvenience to researchers seeking interesting articles online. In this paper, we provide a Bi-Relational graph to represent the heterogenous information of scien-tific article recommendation system, which includes three parts: the article content similarity, researcher interest cor-relation, and researcher-article readership. Meanwhile, an iterative random walk with restarts learning method is pro-posed on the Bi-Relational graph to recommend a researcher rating for each article by making use of the known informa-tion. The proposed method has ability to perform both old and new article recommendation. A series of experiments on CiteULike dataset have shown that our method is more effective than other testing methods in the paper.

With the development of Internet, more and more web-sites like CiteULike and Mendeley allow researchers to create their own on-line reference libraries for the scientific articles they are interested in. As a consequence, an urgent problem is how to automatically extract the hidden information and effectively recommend an article to the potential relevant researchers.

For finding the interesting articles, keyword searching and citation tracking are popularly used in practice. Both of
In order to make use of the existing information sources, a Bi-Relational Graph (BG) is designed to represent recom-mendation data as shown in Figure 1. The graph contains article similarity subgraph, researcher similarity subgraph, and a bipartite graph connecting articles and researcher-s. Among them, article similarity is computed based on the article content. The bipartite graph indicates the read-ership information between articles and researchers, which can also be used to calculate the implicit interest similar-ity between researchers. Consequently, both articles and researchers are equally regarded as vertices, and scientific article recommendation is transformed to a new problem to measure how closely an article is related to a researcher.
In the literature, random walk with restart (RWR) [11] is a good choice to measure vertex-to-vertex relevance, and has recently applied in recommendation systems [3, 4, 5, 9, 14]. The existing RWR technique is based on a fixed graph, however, the Bi-Relational Graph built for scientific article recommendation could be changed once its subgraph is updated. Thus, we propose an iterative Bi-Relational Graph-based RWR method (BG-IteRWR) to compute the article-researcher relevances with automatical and iterative updating the BG graph. Finally, the weight of dashed line with red question mark in Figure 1 can be predicted for old article recommendation and the weight of dashed line with green question mark can be predicted for new article rec-ommendation. A series of experiments on CiteULike data are conducted to demonstrate that BG-IteRWR outperform-s the existing methods for recommending both old and new articles.
In scientific article recommendation system, we have m researchers R = { R 1 ,R 2 ,  X  X  X  ,R m } and n articles A = { A 1 ,A 2 ,  X  X  X  ,A n } . Each article has its title and abstract as content, then it can be represented by a feature vector with v vocabulary words, like A i = { A i 1 ,A i 2 ,  X  X  X  ,A iv } . Then, we can give the pairwise similarities between the articles, denoted as W AA  X  R n  X  n with W AA ( i 1 ,i 2) measuring how closely A i 1 and A i 2 are related. In experiments, the cosine similarity is used to computer W AA .

Based on the researcher-article readership information, each article is associated with r i  X  m researchers X  libraries represented by a binary vector q i  X  X  0 , 1 } m , such that q i ( j )= 1if A i appears in R j researcher X  X  library, otherwise, q i ( j )= 0 (empty value) which needs predicting with the recom-mendation system and let Q =[ q 1 ,q 2 ,  X  X  X  ,q m ]. Each col-umn of Q can be taken as an article vector representing the corresponding researcher. The similarity between two columns (e.g., cosine similarity) indicates how these two re-searchers have the common interests, which is defined as W Let G =( V A V R , E AA E RR E AR ), where E AA  X  X  A  X  V , E RR  X  X  R  X V R ,and E AR  X  X  A  X V R .Amongthem, V A and V R indicate the article and researcher vertices set respec-tively. Obviously, G covers both article content graph G A = ( V
A , E AA ), researcher similarity graph G R =( V R , E RR ), and they are connected by a bipartite graph G B =( V A , V R , E AR ). E
AA and E RR describe the intra-type relations, while E AR
Once the relatedness between all articles and researchers in BG are known, it is easy to recommend article to the corresponding researchers.
 In this paper, we adopt Random Walk with Restart (R-WR) technique to measure the relatedness of two vertices in the graph. In BG graph, the initial researcher correlation subgraph S RR is given, but it is calculated based on Q where the information is incomplete. Thus, a ( n + m )-dimension column vector p  X  j is constructed for the j th researcher sta-tionary probability to simultaneously update the research-article relation and researcher-researcher correlation, which is defined as In this case, the starting station Y is defined as ness between articles and researchers, and P  X  RR  X  R m  X  m , Y
RR  X  R m  X  m for the relatedness between researchers. A-mong them,
Then, the random walk with restart process on S and Y can be defined as
P The stationary probability P  X  of random walk process can be determined via the method proposed in [15] as Since max i j S ( i, j ) = 1, the maximum eigenvalue of S should be less than 1 according to Perron-Frobenius theo-rem, and then I  X  (1  X   X  ) S T is positive definite and invertible, thus, P  X  is solvable.

The above RWR on S is able to learn a better researcher correlation matrix P  X  RR from the original matrix S RR which is directly built from the input data. Thus, it may improve the overall performance by replacing S RR with the learned matrix P  X  RR . Repeat this process, we can recommend good articles to the corresponding researchers.

The proposed BG-IteRWR is different from the RWR method in [5] in two facets. Firstly, we constructed different graph by considering the implicit researcher-researcher correlations and explicit article-article correlations, while Konstas et al. [5] ignored the former one which also leads to different RWR learning process. Secondly, the random walker in [5] has the same probability to hop between inter-type and intra-type subgraph (i.e.,  X  =1 / 2), which is not always tenable and may depend on data as shown in next section. Figure 2: Comparison of old/new article recommen-dation with Recall@N metrics. spectively. Among them, CF only considers the researcher-article readership information, thus it can not recommend new article because there is no relevant researcher for a new coming article. CF-Content, CTR [12], RWR [5] and BG-IteRWR consider article content except for the readership information, thus they has ability to recommend new arti-cle.

It is obvious that BG-IteRWR outperforms the existing methods. For both old and new article recommendation, the improvement is greater when the returned relevant re-searchers is small on Recall, which indicates that BG-IteRWR is able to find the potential researchers which are really in-terested in the corresponding articles. One main reason is as follows. BG-IteRWR considers the researcher correlation-s (sub-matrix S RR in transition probability matrix S )and iteratively updates it, which are helpful to recommend an ar-ticle to the researchers with similar interest. However, such information is ignored in CF, CF-Content, CTR and RWR.
A novel Bi-Relational Graph model is proposed to com-bine article content and researcher-article readership infor-mation in a unified framework for scientific article recom-mendation system. Based on BG, we design an iterative random walk with restarts technique to predict both article-researcher relevances and researcher-researcher correlation-s. The article-researcher relevance can be used to directly recommend both new and old article to the corresponding researchers. Meanwhile, the proposed BG-IteRWR method makes use of the learned researcher-researcher correlation-s to improve the final recommending performance, and is applied on a real world data set CiteULike.
