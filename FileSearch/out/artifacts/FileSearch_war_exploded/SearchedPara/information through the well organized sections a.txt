The Nextgen Librarian X  X  Survival Guide, Rachel Singer Gordon. Information Today, Inc. (2006). xiv, 208 pp., $29.50, ISBN: 1-57387-256-3
Researchers in different fields (psychology, human resource management) are now investigating genera-tional diversity in the workplace. As many have observed, this is the first time in recent history, that four dis-tinct generations  X  Veterans (1922 X 1945); Boomers (1946 X 1964); Gen X (1965 X 1978); and Gen Y (1979 X 2000) also called Millennials or Net Gen are active in the workforce. Those investigating generational differences seek to better understand how generational diversity affects work dynamics. Different generations may share traditional work values, but different generations have very different lifestyles and attitudes and expectations towards their careers, managers and co-workers.

The Nextgen Librarian X  X  Survival Guide by Rachel Singer Gordon addresses some generational issues affect-ing a particular group  X  nextgens  X  in a particular work environment  X  the library workplace. The author is herself a successful nextgen librarian. Her list of achievements include  X  X  The Accidental Library Manager; The Librarian X  X  Guide to Writing for Publication; and The Accidental Systems Librarian; she is also the creator of
LISjobs.com as well as the founding editor of, and frequent contributor to Info Career Trends, an electronic newsletter.

Gordon sets out to provide a practical guide for new and prospective librarians on how to survive the early years of their career. Although the survival guide is broadly aimed at all new library graduates, it specifically targets the perceived needs of those next generation librarians in their 20s and 30s. According to the author, this demographic group is more likely to share age-related attitudes and experiences that are not essentially common to all new librarians some for whom librarianship is a second or third profession.

The survival guide comprises 10 chapters (and two appendices). It is written in an easy to read style with advice offered in a clear and direct manner. The first chapter deals briefly with several issues and opportunities that for the author place next generation librarians in a unique situation. The chapter continues into a discus-sion on the definition of next generation librarianship. Here, the author acknowledges the risk of making sweeping conclusions and advocates instead a scenario of real-life Venn diagrams to findout where overlap-ping experiences and outlooks intersect or differ.

Survival is the broad theme of chapters X  two to five. In these chapters, nextgen librarians are offered prac-tical advice accompanied by lots of support resources. Each of these chapters treat with the down-to-earth challenges of an aspiring librarian: choosing and gaining entry into the right library school, surviving the pro-gramme; when and where to job hunt; what warning signs to watch for during the interview; how to survive entry level positions; how to work with older colleagues; and how to move up the career ladder.
In the remaining chapters more abstract issues are examined such as  X  X  X mage, Stereotypes, and Diversity X  X  in chapter six. Here, Gordon takes a candid look at the profession X  X  self-absorption with its own image as well as the public X  X  perception of librarians.

In chapter six, the author also deals with generational stereotyping and cautions against making age related assumptions about colleagues. Chapter seven outlines the importance of establishing and maintaining profes-sional relationships and networks through various means like professional associations, lifelong learning and mentoring while chapter eight explains why a work/life balance is a vital issue for nextgens. How next gener-ation librarians can transform the profession is the topic of chapter nine and many opportunities and tech-niques to enable pro-activity are cited.

The last chapter is aimed at library administrators and managers. Here, Gordon recommends tips on how library managers can bridge the generational gap and provide growth opportunities for nextgen librarians.
Throughout the book, there is constant emphasis on the need for mutual respect between library staff of all generations. The author also encourages library staff to learn from each other and to take advantage of the numerous and varied strengths that exist in the workplace.

Each chapter in the guide is supported by profiles, resources and statistics. There are as well many quotes and comments taken from two 2005 surveys on the attitudes and experiences of librarians, library workers and Library students both under and over the age of 40. From these voices, the reader is able to form a distinct snapshot of nextgen librarians: their dissatisfaction within the workplace as well as their hopes for the profession and its future.
The updated live links (http://www.lisjobs.com/nextgen/toc.htm) to all the URLs listed in the guide X  X  appendix adds value as does the reading list that includes works from the non-library sector as Neil Howe (on leadership) and Bruce Tulgan (on management training).

One small weakness of the survival guide is that it speaks of the American experience (no nextgen librarians outside America are quoted). For the most part though, nearly all of the issues discussed are global and new librarians everywhere can take advantage of some sound practical counselling backed up by the many lists of resources. The multitude of quotes with advice, experiences and ideas from library workers also adds a rich layer of realism.

The Nextgen Librarian X  X  Survival Guide is an important resource for new and prospective librarians. Fur-thermore, even though the guide targets a particular  X  X  X eneration, X  X  older more established librarians will also find the survival guide interesting reading: the cited concerns of younger librarians as well as their hopes for the profession can help contribute towards a better understanding and improved communication in the multi-generational library workplace.
