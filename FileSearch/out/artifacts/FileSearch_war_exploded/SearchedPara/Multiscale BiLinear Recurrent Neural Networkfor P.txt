 The dynamic nature of bursty traffic data in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks may cause severe netwo rk congestion when a number of bursty sources are involved. Therefore, the demand for dynamic bandwidth allocation to optimally utilize the network resources and satisfy Quality of Service(QoS) requirements should be taken into account. In order to dynamically adapt for bandwidth allocation, prediction of the future network traffic generated by end-users according to the observed past traffic in the network plays a very important role in ATM networks. Various traffic prediction models have been proposed for MPEG video traffic prediction. Classical linear models such as the Autogressive (AR) model [1] and adaptive linear model [2] have been widely used in prac-tice. However, these models may be not suitable for predicting traffic over ATM networks due to the bursty characteristics of these networks.

A number of new nonlinear techniques have been proposed for MPEG video traffic prediction. Among them, the neural network (NN)-based models have received significant attention [3,4]. These recent studies reported that satisfac-tory traffic prediction accuracy can be achieved for a single-step prediction,i.e., the prediction for only next frame. However, the sing-step prediction may not be suitable in application such as dynamic bandwidth allocation since it is im-practical to reallocate the bandwidth fr equently for a single frame. Therefore, multi-step prediction of MPEG video traffic should be explored.
 In this paper, a MPEG video traffic prediction model using a Multiscale BiLinear Recurrent Neural Network (M-BLRNN) [5]is proposed. The M-BLRNN is a wavelet-based neural network archi tecture based on the BiLinear Recurrent Neural Network (BLRNN)[6]. The M-BLRNN is formulated by a combination of several individual BLRNN models in which each individual model is employed for predicting the signal at a certain level obtained by the wavelet transform.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a review of multiresolution analysis with the wavelet transform. A brief review of the BLRNN is given in Section 3. The proposed M-BLRNN-based predictor is presented in Section 4. S ection 5 presents some expe riments and results on several real-time MPEG data sets includi ng a performance comparison with the traditional MLPNN-based predictor and BLRNN-based predictor. Concluding remarks provided in Section 6 close the paper. The multiresolution analysis produces a high quality local representation of a signal in both the time domain and the frequency domain. The wavelet trans-form [7] has been proven suitable for the multiresolution analysis of time series data [8].

The ` a trous wavelet transform was first proposed by Shensa [7] and the cal-culation of the ` a trous wavelet transform can be described as follows: First, a low-pass filter is used to suppress the high frequency components of a signal and allow the low frequency components to pass through. The smoothed data c j ( t ) at a given resolution j can be obtained by performin g successive convolutions with the discrete low-pass filter h , where h is a discrete low-pass filter associ ated with the scaling function and c ( t ) is the original signal. A suitable low-pass filter h is the B 3 spline, defined
From the sequence of the smoothing of the signal, the wavelet coefficients are obtained by calculating the difference b etween successive smoothed versions:
By consequently expanding the original signal from the coarsest resolution level to the finest resolution level, the original signal can be expressed in terms of the wavelet coefficients and the scaling coefficients as follows: where J is the number of resolutions and c J ( t ) is the finest version of the signal. Eq.(3) also provides a reconstruction formula for the original signal. The BLRNN is a simple recurrent neural network, which has a robust ability in modeling dynamically nonlinear systems and is especially suitable for time-series data. The model was initially proposed by Park and Zhu [6]. It has been successfully applied in modeling time-series data [6,9]. In the following, we sum-marize a simple BLRNN that has N input neurons, M hidden neurons and where K = N  X  1 degree polynomials is given. The input signal and the nonlinear in-tegration of the input signal to hidden neurons are: where T denotes the transpose of a vector or matrix and the recurrent term is a M  X  K matrix And where w p is the weight of bias neuron. A p is the weight vector for the recurrent portion, B p is the weight matrix for the bilinear recurrent portion, and C p is the weight vector for the feedforward portion and p =1 , 2 ..., M .
More detailed information on the BLRNN and its learning algorithm can be found in [6,9]. The M-BLRNN is a combination of several individual BLRNN models where each individual BLRNN model is employed to predict the signal at each resolution level obtained by the wavelet transform [5]. Fig. 1 illustrates an example of the M-BLRNN with three levels of resolution.

The prediction of a time-series based on the M-BLRNN can be separated into three stages. In the first stage, the original signal is decomposed into the wavelet coefficients and the scaling coefficients based on the number of resolution levels. In the second stage, the coefficients at each resolution level are predicted by an individual BLRNN model. It should be noted that the predictions of coefficients at each resolution level are independent and can be done in parallel. In the third stage, all the prediction results from ea ch BLRNN are combined together using the reconstruction formula given in Eq.(3): coefficients, the predicted values of the wavelet coefficients at level j ,andthe predicted values of the time-series, respectively. The experiments were conducted based on several real-time MPEG trace se-quences provided by the University of t he Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany. These trace sequences can be downloaded at
We selected 4 typical trace seque nces for training and testing:  X  Star Wars  X ,  X  Mr. Bean  X ,  X  New Show  X , and  X  Silence of the Lambs  X . From these sequences, the first 1,000 frames of the  X  Star Wars  X  sequence were used for training while the remaining of  X  Star Wars  X  and other sequences were saved for testing. All data were subsequently normalized in a range (0,1) to render it suitable for inputs of neural networks.

In order to demonstrate the generalization ability of the M-BLRNN-based predictor, a M-BLRNN model with 3 resolution levels using the adaptive learn-ing algorithm is employed. Based on the statistical analysis of correlations, each individual BLRNN model in the M-BLRNN model shares a 24-10-1 structure and 3 recursion lines in which the indices denote the number of neurons in the input layer, the hidden layer and the output layer, respectively. A traditional BLRNN employing a structure of 24-10-1 with 3 recursion lines and a MLPNN model employing a structure of 24-10-1 are also employed for a performance comparison. The iterated multistep prediction [11] was employed to perform the multistep prediction of the real-time MPEG video traffic. To measure the per-formance of the multistep prediction, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) was employed.

Figs. 2 and 3 show the prediction performance on the remainder of the the  X  X ilence of the Lambs X  and the  X  X ews Show X  , respectively. As can be seen from these figures, the M-BLRNN-based predictor that employs the wavelet-based neural network architecture outperforms both the traditional MLPNN-based predictor and the BLRNN-based predictor. In particular, the M-BLRNN-based predictor can predict up to a hundred steps with a very small degradation of performance whereas the traditional MLPNN-based predictor and the BLRNN-based predictor fail to do so. A MPEG traffic prediction model using a Multiscale BiLinear Recurrent Neural Network (M-BLRNN) is proposed in this paper. The M-BLRNN is a wavelet-based neural network architecture b ased on the BiLinear Recurrent Neural Network (BLRNN). The proposed M-BLRNN-based predictor is applied to the long-term prediction of MPEG video traffic . Experiments and results on several real-time MPEG data sets show a significant improvement in comparison with the traditional MLPNN-based predictor and BLRNN-based predictor. This con-firms that the proposed M-BLRNN is an efficient tool for dynamic bandwidth allocation in ATM networks.
