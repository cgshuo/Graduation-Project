 Speech recognition for dictation or prepared radio and television broadcasts has had huge advances during the last decades. For example, broadcast news (BN) in English can now be recognized with about ten percent word error rate (WER) (NIST, 2000) which results in mostly quite understandable text. Some rare and new words may be missing but the result has proven to be sufficient for many im-portant applications, such as browsing and retrieval of recorded speech and information retrieval from the speech (Garofolo et al., 2000). However, besides the development of powerful computers and new al-gorithms, a crucial factor in this development is the vast amount of transcribed speech and suitable text data that has been collected for training the mod-els. The problem faced in porting the BN recogni-tion systems to conversational speech or to other lan-guages is that almost as much new speech and text data have to be collected again for the new task.
The reason for the need for a vast amount of train-ing texts is that the state-of-the-art statistical lan-guage models contain a huge amount of parameters to be estimated in order to provide a proper probabil-ity for any possible word sequence. The main reason for the huge model size is that for an acceptable cov-erage in an English BN task, the vocabulary must be very large, at least 50,000 words, or more. For languages with a higher degree of word inflections than English, even larger vocabularies are required. This paper focuses on the agglutinative languages in which words are frequently formed by concatenat-ing one or more stems, prefixes, and suffixes. For these languages in which the words are often highly inflected as well as formed from several morphemes, even a vocabulary of 100,000 most common words would not give sufficient coverage (Kneissler and Klakow, 2001; Hirsim X ki et al., 2005). Thus, the solution to the language modeling clearly has to in-volve splitting of words into smaller modeling units that could then be adequately modeled.

This paper focuses on solving the vocabulary problem for several languages in which the speech and text database resources are much smaller than for the world X  X  main languages. A common fea-ture for the agglutinative languages, such as Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian and Turkish is that the large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) attempts so far have not resulted comparable perfor-mance to the English systems. The reason for this is not only the language modeling difficulties, but, of course, the lack of suitable speech and text train-ing data resources. In (Geutner et al., 1998; Sii-vola et al., 2001) the systems aim at reducing the active vocabulary and language models to a feasi-ble size by clustering and focusing. In (Szarvas and Furui, 2003; Alum X e, 2005; Hacioglu et al., 2003) the words are split into morphemes by language-dependent hand-crafted morphological rules. In (Kneissler and Klakow, 2001; Arisoy and Arslan, 2005) different combinations of words, grammati-cal morphemes and endings are utilized to decrease the OOV rate and optimize the speech recognition accuracy. However, constant large improvements over the conventional word-based language models in LVCSR have been rare.

The approach presented in this paper relies on a data-driven algorithm called Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2002; Creutz and Lagus, 2005) which is a language independent unsupervised machine learn-ing method to find morpheme-like units (called sta-tistical morphs) from a large text corpus. This method has several advantages over the rule-based grammatical morphemes, e.g. that no hand-crafted rules are needed and all words can be processed, even the foreign ones. Even if good grammatical morphemes are available, the language modeling re-sults by the statistical morphs seem to be at least as good, if not better (Hirsim X ki et al., 2005). In this paper we evaluate the statistical morphs for three agglutinative languages and describe three different speech recognition systems that successfully utilize the n-gram language models trained for these units in the corresponding LVCSR tasks. 2.1 Unsupervised discovery of morph units Naturally, there are many ways to split the words into smaller units to reduce a lexicon to a tractable size. However, for a subword lexicon suitable for language modeling applications such as speech recognition, several properties are desirable: 1. The size of the lexicon should be small enough 2. The coverage of the target language by words 3. The units should be somehow meaningful, so 4. In speech recognition one should be able to de-
A common approach to find the subword units is to program the language-dependent grammatical rules into a morphological analyzer and utilize that to then split the text corpus into morphemes as in e.g. (Hirsim X ki et al., 2005; Alum X e, 2005; Ha-cioglu et al., 2003). There are some problems re-lated to ambiguous splits and pronunciations of very short inflection-type units, but also the coverage in, e.g., news texts may be poor because of many names and foreign words.

In this paper we have adopted a similar approach as (Hirsim X ki et al., 2005). We use unsupervised learning to find the best units according to some cost function. In the Morfessor algorithm the minimized cost is the coding length of the lexicon and the words in the corpus represented by the units of the lexicon. This minimum description length based cost func-tion is especially appealing, because it tends to give units that are both as frequent and as long as possi-ble to suit well for both training the language models and also decoding of the speech. Full coverage of the language is also guaranteed by splitting the rare words into very short units, even to single phonemes if necessary. For language models utilized in speech recognition, the lexicon of the statistical morphs can be further reduced by omitting the rare words from the input of the Morfessor algorithm. This operation does not reduce the coverage of the lexicon, because it just splits the rare words then into smaller units, but the smaller lexicon may offer a remarkable speed up of the recognition.

The pronunciation of, especially, the short units may be ambiguous and may cause severe problems in languages like English, in which the pronuncia-tions can not be adequately determined from the or-thography. In most agglutinative languages, such as Finnish, Estonian and Turkish, rather simple letter-to-phoneme rules are, however, sufficient for most cases. 2.2 Building the lexicon for open vocabulary The whole training text corpus is first passed through a word splitting transformation as in Figure 1. Based on the learned subword unit lexicon, the best split for each word is determined by performing a Viterbi search with the unigram probabilities of the units. At this point the word break symbols are added between each word in order to incorporate that information in the statistical language models, as well. Then the n-gram models are trained similarly as if the language units were words including word and sentence break symbols as additional units. 2.3 Building the n-gram model over morphs Even though the required morph lexicon is much smaller than the lexicon for the corresponding word n-gram estimation, the data sparsity problem is still important. Interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothing is utilized to tune the language model probabilities in the same way as found best for the word n-grams. The n-grams that are not very useful for modeling the language can be discarded from the model in order to keep the model size down. For Turkish, we used the entropy based pruning (Stolcke, 1998), where the n-grams, that change the model entropy less than a given treshold, are discarded from the model. For Finnish and Estonian, we used n-gram growing (Siivola and Pellom, 2005). The n-grams that increase the training set likelihood enough with respect to the corresponding increase in the model size are accepted into the model (as in the minimum description length principle). After the growing pro-Text corpus Figure 1: The steps in the process of estimating a language model based on statistical morphs from a text corpus (Hirsim X ki et al., 2005). cess the model is further pruned with entropy based pruning. The method allows us to train models with higher order n-grams, since the memory consump-tion is lower and also gives somewhat better mod-els. Both methods can also be viewed as choosing the correct model complexity for the training data to avoid over-learning. Before presenting the speech recognition results, some statistical properties are presented for the three agglutinative languages studied. If we consider choosing a vocabulary of the 50k-70k most common words, as usual in English broadcast news LVCSR systems, the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate in En-glish is typically smaller than 1%. Using the lan-guage model training data the following OOV rates can be found for a vocabulary including only the most common words: 15% OOV for 69k in Finnish (Hirsim X ki et al., 2005), 10% for 60k in Estonian and 9% for 50k in Turkish. As shown in (Hacioglu et al., 2003) this does not only mean the same amount of extra speech recognition errors, but even more, because the recognizer tends to lose track when un-known words get mapped to those that are in the vo-cabulary. Even doubling the vocabulary is not a suf-Figure 2: Vocabulary growth of words and morphs for Turkish language ficient solution, because a vocabulary twice as large (120k) would only reduce the OOV rate to 6% in Estonian and 5% in Turkish. In Finnish even a 400k vocabulary of the most common words still gives 5% OOV in the language model training material.
Figure 2 illustrates the vocabulary explosion en-countered when using words and how using morphs avoids this problem for Turkish. The figure on the left shows the vocabulary growth for both words and morphs. The figure on the right shows the graph for morphs in more detail. As seen in the figure, the number of new words encountered continues to increase as the corpus size gets larger whereas the number of new morphs encountered levels off. 4.1 About selection of the recognition tasks In this work the morph-based language models have been applied in speech recognition for three differ-ent agglutinative languages, Finnish, Estonian and Turkish. The recognition tasks are speaker depen-dent and independent fluent dictation of sentences taken from newspapers and books, which typically require very large vocabulary language models. 4.2 Finnish Finnish is a highly inflected language, in which words are formed mainly by agglutination and com-pounding. Finnish is also the language for which the algorithm for the unsupervised morpheme discovery (Creutz and Lagus, 2002) was originally developed. The units of the morph lexicon for the experiments in this paper were learned from a joint corpus con-taining newspapers, books and newswire stories of totally about 150 million words (CSC, 2001). We obtained a lexicon of 25k morphs by feeding the learning algorithm with the word list containing the 160k most common words. For language model training we used the same text corpus and the re-cently developed growing n-gram training algorithm (Siivola and Pellom, 2005). The amount of resulted n-grams are listed in Table 4. The average length of a morph is such that a word corresponds to 2.52 morphs including a word break symbol.

The speech recognition task consisted of a book read aloud by one female speaker as in (Hirsim X ki et al., 2005). Speaker dependent cross-word triphone models were trained using the first 12 hours of data and evaluated by the last 27 minutes. The models included tied state hidden Markov models (HMMs) of totally 1500 different states, 8 Gaussian mixtures (GMMs) per state, short-time mel-cepstral features (MFCCs), maximum likelihood linear transforma-tion (MLLT) and explicit phone duration models (Pylkk X nen and Kurimo, 2004). The real-time fac-tor of recognition speed was less than 10 xRT with a 2.2 GHz CPU. However, with the efficient LVCSR decoder utilized (Pylkk X nen, 2005) it seems that by making an even smaller morph lexicon, such as 10k, the decoding speed could be optimized to only a few times real-time without an excessive trade-off with recognition performance. 4.3 Estonian Estonian is closely related to Finnish and a similar language modeling approach was directly applied to the Estonian recognition task. The text corpus used to learn the morph units and train the statis-tical language model consisted of newspapers and books, altogether about 55 million words (Segakor-pus, 2005). At first, 45k morph units were obtained as the best subword unit set from the list of the 470k most common words in the corpora. For speed-ing up the recognition, the morph lexicon was after-wards reduced to 37k by splitting the rarest morphs (occurring in only one or two words) further into smaller ones. Corresponding growing n-gram lan-guage models as in Finnish were trained from the Estonian corpora resulting the n-grams in Table 4.
The speech recognition task in Estonian consisted of long sentences read by 50 randomly picked held-out test speakers, 7 sentences each (a part of (Meister et al., 2002)). Unlike the Finnish and Turkish micro-phone data, this data was recorded from telephone, i.e. 8 kHz sampling rate and narrow band data in-stead of 16 kHz and normal (full) bandwidth. The phoneme models were trained for speaker indepen-dent recognition using windowed cepstral mean sub-traction and significantly more data (over 200 hours and 1300 speakers) than for the Finnish task. The speaker independence, together with the telephone quality and occasional background noises, made this task still a considerably more difficult one. Other-wise the acoustic models were similar cross-word triphone GMM-HMMs with MFCC features, MLLT transformation and the explicit phone duration mod-eling, except larger: 5100 different states and 16 GMMs per state. Thus, the recognition speed is also slower than in Finnish, about 20 xRT (2.2GHz CPU). 4.4 Turkish Turkish is another a highly-inflected and agglutina-tive language with relatively free word order. The same Morfessor tool (Creutz and Lagus, 2005) as in Finnish and Estonian was applied to Turkish texts as well. Using the 360k most common words from the training corpus, 34k morph units were obtained. The training corpus consists of approximately 27M words taken from literature, law, politics, social sciences, popular science, information technology, medicine, newspapers, magazines and sports news. N-gram language models for different orders with interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothing as well as en-tropy based pruning were built for this morph lexi-con using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). The number of n-grams for the highest order we tried (6-grams without entropy-based pruning) are reported in Table 4. In average, there are 2.37 morphs per word including the word break symbol.

The recognition task in Turkish consisted of ap-proximately one hour of newspaper sentences read by one female speaker. We used decision-tree state clustered cross-word triphone models with approx-imately 5000 HMM states. Instead of using letter to phoneme rules, the acoustic models were based directly on letters. Each state of the speaker inde-pendent HMMs had a GMM with 6 mixture compo-nents. The HTK frontend (Young et al., 2002) was used to get the MFCC based acoustic features. The explicit phone duration models were not applied. The training data contained 17 hours of speech from over 250 speakers. Instead of the LVCSR decoder used in Finnish and Estonian (Pylkk X nen, 2005), the Turkish evaluation was performed using another de-coder (AT&amp;T, 2003), Using a 3.6GHz CPU, the real-time factor was around one. The recognition results for the three different tasks: Finnish, Estonian and Turkish, are provided in Ta-bles 1  X  3. In each task the word error rate (WER) and letter error rate (LER) statistics for the morph-based system is compared to a corresponding word-based system. The resulting morpheme strings are glued to words according to the word break symbols included in the language model (see Section 2.2) and the WER is computed as the sum of substituted, in-serted and deleted words divided by the correct num-ber of words. LER is included here as well, because although WER is a more common measure, it is not comparable between languages. For example, in ag-glutinative languages the words are long and contain a variable amount of morphemes. Thus, any incor-rect prefix or suffix would make the whole word in-correct. The n-gram language model statistics are given in Table 4.
 Table 1: The LVCSR performance for the speaker-dependent Finnish task consisting of book-reading (see Section 4.2). For a reference (word-based) lan-guage model a 400k lexicon was chosen.
 Table 2: The LVCSR performance for the speaker-independent Estonian task consisting of read sen-tences recorded via telephone (see Section 4.3). For a reference (word-based) language model a 60k lex-icon was used here. Table 3: The LVCSR performance for the speaker-independent Turkish task consisting of read news-paper sentences (see Section 4.4). For the refer-ence 50k (word-based) language model the accuracy given by 4 and 5-grams did not improve from that of 3-grams.

In the Turkish recognizer the memory constraints during network optimization (Allauzen et al., 2004) allowed the use of language models only up to 5-grams. The language model pruning thresholds were optimized over a range of values and the best re-sults are shown in Table 3. We also tried the same experiments with two-pass recognition. In the first pass, instead of the best path, lattice output was gen-erated with the same language models with prun-ing. Then these lattices were rescored using the non-pruned 6-gram language models (see Table 4) and the best path was taken as the recognition output. For the word-based reference model, the two-pass recognition gave no improvements. It is likely that the language model training corpus was too small to train proper 6-gram word models. However, for the morph-based model, we obtained a slight improve-ment (0.7 % absolute) by two-pass recognition. The key result of this paper is that we can success-fully apply the unsupervised statistical morphs in large vocabulary language models in all the three ex-perimented agglutinative languages. Furthermore, the results show that in all the different LVCSR tasks, the morph-based language models perform very well and constantly dominate the reference lan-guage model based on words.

Note that the Turkish language model was not prepared by the growing n-gram algorithm as the others and the model was limited to 6-grams. con is built from the word fragments allows the con-struction of statistical language models, in practice, for almost an unlimited vocabulary by a lexicon that still has a convenient size.

The recognition was here restricted to agglutina-tive languages and tasks in which the language used is both rather general and matches fairly well with the available training texts. Significant performance variation in different languages can be observed here, because of the different tasks and the fact that comparable recognition conditions and training re-sources have not been possible to arrange. However, we believe that the tasks are still both difficult and realistic enough to illustrate the difference of per-formance when using language models based on a lexicon of morphs vs. words in each task. There are no directly comparable previous LVCSR results on the same tasks and data, but the closest ones which can be found are slightly over 20% WER for the Finnish task (Hirsim X ki et al., 2005), slightly over 40 % WER for the Estonian task (Alum X e, 2005) and slightly over 30 % WER for the Turkish task (Erdogan et al., 2005).

Naturally, it is also possible to prepare a huge lex-icon and still succeed in recognition fairly well (Sar-aclar et al., 2002; McTait and Adda-Decker, 2003; Hirsim X ki et al., 2005), but this is not a very con-venient approach because of the resulting huge lan-guage models or the heavy pruning required to keep them still tractable. The word-based language mod-els that were constructed in this paper as reference models were trained as much as possible in the same way as the corresponding morph language models. For Finnish and Estonian the growing n-grams (Sii-vola and Pellom, 2005) were used including the op-tion of constructing the OOV words from phonemes as in (Hirsim X ki et al., 2005). For Turkish a con-ventional n-gram was built by SRILM similarly as for the morphs. The recognition approach taken for Turkish involves a static decoding network construc-tion and optimization resulting in near real time de-coding. However, the memory requirements of net-work optimization becomes prohibitive for large lex-icon and language models as presented in this paper.
In this paper the recognition speed was not a ma-jor concern, but from the application point of view that is a very important factor to be taken into a ac-count in the comparison. It seems that the major fac-tors that make the recognition slower are short lexi-cal units, large lexicon and language models and the amount of Gaussian mixtures in the acoustic model. This work presents statistical language models trained on different agglutinative languages utilizing a lexicon based on the recently proposed unsuper-vised statistical morphs. To our knowledge this is the first work in which similarly developed subword unit lexica are developed and successfully evaluated in three different LVCSR systems in different lan-guages. In each case the morph-based approach con-stantly shows a significant improvement over a con-ventional word-based LVCSR language models. Fu-ture work will be the further development of also the grammatical morph-based language models and comparison of that to the current approach, as well as extending this evaluation work to new languages.
