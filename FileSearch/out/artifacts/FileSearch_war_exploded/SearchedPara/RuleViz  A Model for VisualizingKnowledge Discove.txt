 W e prop ose an interactive mo del, RuleViz, for visualizi ng the entire pro cess of knowledge discovery and data mining. The mo del consists of ve comp onents according to the main ingredients of the knowledge discovery pro cess: original data visualizati on, visual data reduction, visual data prepro cess, visual rule discov ery , and rule visualiza tion . The RuleViz mo del for visualizi ng the pro cess of knowledge discovery is intro duced and each comp onent is discussed. Tw o asp ects are emphasized, human-machine interaction and pro cess vi-sualization . The interaction helps the KDD system navigate through the enormous search spaces and recognize the in-tentions of the user, and the visualizati on of the KDD pro-cess helps users gain b etter insigh tin to the multidimensi on al data, understand the intermediate results, and interpret the discovered patterns.
 According to the RuleViz mo del, we implemen tanin ter-active system, CViz, which exploits \parallel co ordinates" technique to visualize the pro cess of rule induction. The original data is visualized on the parallel co ordinates, and can b e interactively reduced b oth horizontall y and vertically. Three approaches for discretizing numerical attributes are provided in the visual data prepro cessing. CViz learns clas-si cation rules on the basis of a rule induction algorithm and presents the result as the algorithm pro ceeds. The discov-ered rules are nally visualized on the parallel co ordinates with each rule b eing displayed as a directed \p olygon", and the rule accuracy and quality are used to render the \p oly-gons" and control the choice of rules to b e displayed to avoid clutter. The CViz system has b een exp erimented with the UCI data sets and synthesis data sets, and the results demonstrate that the RuleViz mo del and the implemented visualizati on system are useful and helpful for understand-ing the pro cess of knowledge discovery and interpreting the nal results.

Kno wledge discovery in databases (KDD) is a pro cess of discovering useful patterns from the original large data sets. The KDD pro cess is interactive and iterative, inv olving n u-merous steps with many decisions b eing made b y the user [13]. Most existing metho ds for kno wledge discovery re-p orted in the literature stresses the interactions b etween the human and the machine. Their implementations , however, fo cus on the logical algorithms for data mining rather than the in teractions. Some visualiza tion systems develop either the original data visualizatio n or the nal results visualiza -tion, but few of them emphasize the visualizati on of the en tire pro cess of KDD and the interactions for navigating through the searc hspace.
 Currently ,t wo imp ortant approaches for knowledge disco v-ery can b e c haracterized as algorithm-based and visualizatio n-based [8]. The former includes rule induction [3], concept learning [27], asso ciation mining [26], decision tree induc-tion [30], neural networks [10], etc. These metho ds sp ecify the target formats and pursue the asso ciations b etween the outcome variable and the indep enden tv ariables. On the other hand, the latter sp eci es the hyp othesis by means of visualizati on metaphors. Man ytec hniques and systems for data visualizatio n and/or knowledge visualizatio n hav ebeen dev elop ed and implemented [2, 5, 7, 11, 12, 17, 18, 23, 24]. These visualizati on systems can b e divided into tw o cate-gories, one visualizi ng the raw data like Sp ot re [2], Inde-p endence Diagrams [7], Perio dic Data [11], DViz [18], and VisDb [23], and the other visualizin g the nal results like Decision Tree Construction [5], Map Visualizer and Tree Visualizer develop ed by Silicon Graphics [17]. One com-mon feature of these existing systems is their dep endence on computer graphics and scienti c visualizati on. Most visual-ization systems lack the ability to visualize the en tire pro-

KDD 2000, Boston, MA USA  X  ACM 2000 1 -58113 -233 -6/00/0 8 ...$5.00 cess of kno wledge disco v ery . In data visualizatio n systems, the complex data are carefully arranged and displa y ed in a sp eci c visual form, and the kno wledge b ehind the original data is left to the users who m ust observ e and determine the meaning of the pictures. This usually requires a w ealth of bac kground kno wledge on graphics and application s. On the other hand, the kno wledge visualizati on systems visualize the disco v ered kno wledge according to di eren ttec hniques suc h as decision trees, neural net w orks, etc. Ho w ev er, these systems only displa y the results on the basis of some param-eters sp eci ed b y the user, and the user can not understand ho w the results are obtained and in terpreted. In teractiv e visualizati on system of kno wledge disco v ery should pro vide a user with not only the original data and/or the disco v ered results but also the en tire pro cess in visual forms so that the user can participate in the disco v ery pro cess, pro vide heuristics, guide the na vigation of searc h, and in terpret the disco v ered kno wledge.
 W e prop ose an in teractiv e visualizatio n mo del, RuleViz, whic h stresses t w o asp ects, h uman-mac hine in teraction and visu-alization during the en tire KDD pro cess. The in teraction bet w een the user and the mac hine helps the KDD system na vigate through the enormous searc h spaces and recognize the in ten tions of the user, and the user easily pro vides the system with heuristics and domain kno wledge and sp eci es parameters. On the other hand, the visualizati on of the KDD pro cess helps users gain b etter insigh tin to the m ulti-dimensional data, understand the in termediate results, and in terpret the disco v ered patterns.
 W e also implemen tanin teractiv e system, CViz, according to the RuleViz mo del for visualizin g the pro cess of classi -cation rule induction. The CViz system uses p ar al lel c o or-dinates tec hnique [22, 24] to visualize the original data and the discretized data, and the disco v ered rules are also vi-sualized as rule p olygons on the parallel co ordinates system with di eren t colors represen ting the rule accuracy and the rule qualit y .
 This pap er is organized as follo ws. The RuleViz mo del and its v e comp onen ts are prop osed in Section 2. In Section 3, the CViz system is presen ted, and the exp erimen ts with CViz are illustrated. Finally , Section 4 is the concluding remarks. Generally sp eaking, the kno wledge disco v ery in databases is considered to b e the nontrivial pr o c ess of identifying valid, novel, p otential ly useful, and ultimately understandab le p at-terns in data [14]. It uses the database along with an yre-quired selection, prepro cessing, sub-sampling, and transfor-mations to apply data mining algorithms to en umerate pat-terns and to ev aluate the pro ducts of data mining to iden tify the subset of the en umerated patterns deemed \kno wledge" [10]. This pro cess underlines an in teractiv e and user-friendly c haracter of o v erall activities. Man y discussions ab out the KDD pro cess and its main ingredien ts are presen tin the literature. Basically , the KDD pro cess consists of data col-lection, target data creation, data cleaning, data prepro-cessing, data reduction, data mining, pattern in terpretation, and kno wledge application [8]. The KDD pro cess relies on ah uman-system in teraction. It is imp ossibl e to en vision a fully automated pro cess of kno wledge disco v ery b ecause this requires that the system p ossess all domain kno wledge and b e capable of recognizing the in ten tions of the user. Hence, e ectiv eh uman-mac hine in teraction pla ys an imp ortan t rule in the KDD pro cess. V arious visualizati on to ols can b e used to concern the in teraction and help incorp orate the user's in-ten tions and na vigate through the enormous searc h spaces in teractiv ely .
 In order to construct suc hin teractiv e systems, w e suggest an in teractiv e visualiza tion mo del, RuleViz, to visualize the en tire pro cess of kno wledge disco v ery . It consists of the v e comp onen ts: original data visualizati on , in teractiv e data re-duction (horizon tally and v ertically), visual data prepro cess suc hasn umerical attribute discretization and data transfor-mation, pattern disco v ery lik e rule induction and decision tree construction, and pattern visualizati on , sho wn in Fig-ure 1. According to this mo del, w e implemen tanin teractiv e visualizati on system, CViz, for rule induction. In this sec-tion, w e brie y describ e eac h comp onen t and explain what tec hniques can b e used in eac hstep. Original data visualizati on is to use a v ariet y of data visual-ization tec hniques to appropriately displa y the original data in some visual form. Ho w the original data is visualized de-p ends on the patterns that are to b e disco v ered. The goal of this comp onen tistogiv e the user insigh t that is virtually imp ossible to get from lo oking at tables of output or simple summary statistics. The original data visualizati on can tell ho w the ra w data is distributed, where the in teresting data fo cuses on, and whether the patterns can b e observ ed. The patterns to b e searc hed for migh t b e classi cati on rules or asso ciation rules, at rules or hierarc hical rules, etc. Di eren t patterns ma y require di eren t visual forms in order for the user to observ e and determine the in teresting areas. F or example, classi cation rules ma y require that the fo cus b e on the relationshi ps b et w een the condition attributes and their v alues and decision attribute and their class lab els. The asso ciation rules ma y require the fo cus to b e on the relationship s among item subsets for item transaction data sets, or the relationship s among the v alue ranges of di eren t attributes for n umerical data sets. The decision trees ma y require the fo cus to b e on the hierarc h y of concepts or the distribution of data in di eren t regions (branc hes). According to [24], the goals of data visualizati on could b e one of three asp ects: explor atory analysis , whic h searc hes for the structures, trends, and clusters of the data; c on r-matory analysis ,whic h con rms or rejects the pre-de ned h yp otheses; and pr esentatio n , whic h presen ts the facts. In our mo del, w e assume the original data visualizati on is to presen t the data.
 There are man y data visualizatio n tec hniques that can b e used in our mo del, including geometric tec hniques, icon-based tec hniques, pixel-orien ted tec hniques, hierarc hical tec h-niques, graph-based tec hniques, dynamic tec hniques, and their com bination. It m ust b e emphasized that the dis-tance measure b et w een data p oin ts when visualized is so imp ortan t that inappropriate measure will lead the user in a wrong direction or in to a mistak en action in the follo w-Preprocessed Data Set ing steps. Usually , the distance measure can b e Euclidean, Mank o wski, Tsc heb ysc hev, and others.
 In the CViz system [20], the parallel co ordinates approac h, a kind of geometric tec hnique, is used to visualize the original data, where eac hh yp erp oin t is displa y ed as a p olyline across the parallel co ordinates. Data reduction is to reduce the redundan t or insigni cant data, or select a small p ortion to represen t the en tire set due to time complexit y and/or main memory capacit y . This is necessary for real-w orld applicatio ns as databases are usu-ally h uge. F or example, the database in W al-Mart is in-creased o v er 20 million transactions a da y [13]. Ho w ev er, man y kno wledge disco v ery tec hniques are v ery sensitiv eto the size of data in terms of time complexit y and storage complexit y .F or in teractiv ekno wledge disco v ery , the origi-nal data can b e cleaned b y the user who ma y observ ethe data distribution through the visual form of the original data and determine whic h data area he/she is in terested in, whic h attributes are more imp ortan t than others, and whic h at-tribute v alues are redundan t and can b e remo v ed. Man y approac hes to data reduction ha v e b een prop osed and implemen ted for kno wledge disco v ery [21]. Basically ,t w o categories of algorithms ha v ebeenin v estigated and dev el-op ed extensiv ely . One category fo cuses on the reduction of features or attributes (v ertical reduction) whic h are used to represen t the original data, called fe atur e sele ction [10, 25]. F eature selection is trying to nd the b est feature subset from the original feature set according to a giv en selection criterion. The goal is to reduce the data dimensionali t yb y selecting imp ortan t attributes without or with less loss of in-formation b ehind the data so that the data can b e expressed in some succinct formation and the data size is decreased to the exten t that the algorithms can e X cien tly execute in the main memory . In CViz, users can remo v e attributes whic h they think less in teresting b yclic king the corresp onding co-ordinates.
 The other category addresses example sele ction ,or tuple se-le ction (horizon tal reduction) whic h selects or searc hes for a represen tativ e p ortion of the original data set that can ful-ll a kno wledge disco v ering task as if the whole data set is exploited [10, 21]. Example selection tec hniques can b e di-vided in to t w o main classes: p ar ametric te chnique s and non-p ar ametric te chnique s [6]. The former assumes a parametric mo del for the data distributio n, lik e Gaussian or exp onen-tial distributions , and then estimates the parameters of the mo del. After the parameter estimate is obtained the t ypical data, with resp ect to the parametric mo del, can b e dra wn according to their t ypicalit y measure, whic h forms the rep-resen tativ e p ortion of the original data [21]. The latter do es not assume an y mo del for the data. The original data can b e randomly sampled or sampled based on the use of criterion functions.
 The n umerical attribute discretization and concept hierar-c h y clim bing can also b e used to reduce the original data set horizon tally . By discretizing the n umerical attributes in to in terv al attributes, the tuples that fall in the same h yp er-in terv als can b e com bined. In the RuleViz mo del, n umerical attribute discretization is done in the next comp onen t, data pr epr o c essing . By clim bing the concept hierarc h y , feature v alues can b e substituted b y their higher lev el v alues in the prede ned hierarc h y of categorical v alues of this attribute. In CViz, users can remo v e the unin teresting attribute v alues b y clic king corresp onding co ordinates p ortion, th us all tu-ples that pass b y this attribute-v alue p oin t will b e remo v ed from the data set.
 The outcome of data reduction is a subset of the original data set whic h has b een cleaned v ertically and horizon tall y , and will b e used to b e the represen tativ e of the en tire data set. This step can b e rep eated un til the selected data subset is satisfactory in terms of the user's in ten tions or some pre-sp eci ed criteria. Data prepro cess is a sequence of op erations that con v ert the original data to the target format for the data mining algo-rithms. It includes sev eral asp ects suc h as data normaliza-tion, data transformation and feature extraction, handling the missing attribute v alues and noisy data, n umerical at-tribute discretization , and so on [10].
 When the data is visualized or pro cessed for the kno wledge disco v ery , they ma y require scaling and normalization. A simple normalization form ula is: where x and x are the mean and standard deviation of attribute x , resp ectiv ely .
 Data transformation is to transform the curren t data in to appropriate format whic h can b e used directly b y the sp e-ci c kno wledge disco v ery algorithms. F or example, in the CViz system, ELEM2 is c hosen as the rule induction algo-rithm, whic h requires that the data and the nal rules b e in the form of &lt; attr ibute; v al ue &gt; pairs. Another trans-formation is fe atur e extr action ,whic hma ylo w er the dimen-sionalit y of the patterns b y extracting the most informativ e data features based on the attribute dep endency analysis. It transforms the ra w data in to condensed represen tation, resulting in the reduction of data. Principle co ordinates analysis (PCA) is an imp ortan t approac h for extracting fea-tures [16]. Basically ,for p -dimensional space, b y analyzing the distance matrix b et w een data p oin ts, PCA searc hes for s&lt;p and de nes s axes to appro ximately represen tthe original space.
 Sev eral solutions to the problem of generating decision tree or decision rules from the training set of examples with un-kno wn v alues ha v e b een prop osed [27, 30]. The simplest among them consists in remo ving examples with unkno wn v alues or replacing missing v alues with the most common v alues. More complex approac hes are to use a Ba y esian formalism to determine the probabilit y distribution of the missing v alue o v er the p ossible v alues from the domain, and either c ho ose the most lik ely v alue or divide the example in to fractional examples, eac h with one p ossible v alue w eigh ted according to the probabili ties determined.
 As men tioned previously , one imp ortan t task of data prepro-cess is to discretize n umerical attributes. Most approac hes for disco v ering kno wledge discretize the n umerical attributes in to in terv als and then treat the discretized attributes as categorical ones and in terv als as categorical v alues. A dis-cretization pro cess consists of t w o general steps. The rst is deciding the n um b er of discrete in terv als, and the second is determining the b oundaries of eac hin terv als. There are man y approac hes to this problem, suc has e qui-size dp arti-tion [15, 18], whic h nds the minim um and maxim um v alues for eac hn umerical attributes and divides this range in to a n um b er of user-sp eci ed equal width discrete in terv als; e qui-depth p artition [29], whic h sorts the v alues of eac h attribute and then divides these v alues in to the user-sp eci ed n um-ber of in terv als suc h that eac hin terv al con tains the roughly same n um b er of sorted attribute v alues; entr opy-b ase dp ar-tition [4, 10, 30], whic h discretizes the attributes based on maximal en trop y of the partition; and distanc e-b ase dp ar-tition [26], whic h partitions the attribute v alue range b y iden tifying and com bining clusters of data p oin ts. In CViz, three approac hes for discretizing n umerical attributes are pro vided, including e qui-size dp artition , bin-p acking b ase d e qui-depth appr o ach , and the ED A-DB ( Entr opy-b ase d Dis-cr etization A c c or ding to Distribution of Boundary p oints ) metho d [20], where the bin-pac king based approac hisan image-based approac h, while the other t w o are algorithm-based approac hes. P attern disco v ery is the task of data mining, an imp ortan t step of KDD, whic hsearc hes for patterns of in terest in a particular represen tation form.
 There ha v ebeen t w o approac hes for pattern disco v ery so far. One is algorithm-b ase d , and the other is image-b ase d . Algorithm-based approac h stresses the logic and/or statis-tics reasoning and attempts to nd the patterns b ehind the data mathematically . Decision tree tec hniques [30], neural net w orks, statistics metho ds [27] asso ciation rule mining al-gorithms [26], rule induction [3], and case-based reasoning [27] b elong to this category .
 The other category of approac hes for nding patterns from large data sets is to directly use the images that visualize the prepro cessed data [19, 15]. The c haracteristics suc has shap e, color, brigh tness, etc. of the image pro vides us di-v erse information whic hcanbedev elop ed to disco v er pat-terns. This approac h dep ends on the visualizatio n tec h-niques.
 In our implemen tation, CViz em b eds a learning algorithm ELEM2 [3] to disco v er classi cation rules, while A Viz is an image-b ase d approac h for disco v ering n umerical asso ciation rules for large data sets [19]. The last comp onen t is pattern visualizati on whic h is to vi-sualize the patterns ac hiev ed in pattern disco v ery on the screen. Since di eren t patterns ma yha v e di eren tc harac-teristics, they m ust b e dra wn with di eren t tec hniques. A collection of visualizatio n routines should b e dev elop ed to adapt to di eren t patterns to re ect their c haracteristics. F or example, a tree structure can b e used to represen t hier-arc hical concepts. Icon shap es and colors whic hc hange with sliders can b e used to represen t the asso ciations b et w een at-tributes. Animation and uid o w can b e used to sho w the ev olution of attributes.
 There ha v e b een sev eral pattern visualizati on systems. Sil-icon Graphics dev elop ed a data mining pac k age, MineSet, whic hhassev eral visualiza tion comp onen ts [9, 17], including Map Visualizer and T ree Visualizer. The Map Visualizer is used to displa y quan titativ e and relational c haracteristics of spatially orien ted data, where data items are asso ciated with graphics \bar c hart" ob jects in the visual landscap e whic h can consist of a collection of spatially related ob jects, eac h with individua l heigh ts and colors. The T ree Visualizer dis-pla ys quan titativ e and relational c haracteristics of data b y sho wing them as hierarc hical ly connected no des. It tak es the data at the lo w est lev el of the hierarc h y as input, visualizes the data as a three-dimensional \landscap e", and presen ts the data as clustered, hierarc hical blo c ks (no de) and bars through whic h part or all of the data set can b e dynami-cally na vigated and view ed. In addition, sev eral researc hers ha v e also studied extensiv ely the decision tree visualiza tion , lik e the in teractiv e visualizatio n of decision tree construc-tion [5] and the in teractiv e construction of t w o-and three-dimensional decision trees [1]. Items asso ciation rules visu-alization and neural net w orks visualizati on are discussed in [1], while the n umerical asso ciation rules visualizati on meth-o ds can b e found in [15, 19].
 The CViz system dra w the classi cation rules on the parallel co ordinates as rule p olygons . W e dev elop an in teractiv e system, CViz, for visualizin g the pro cess of classi catio n rule induction according to the Rule-Viz mo del. The CViz system is based on the parallel co-ordinates tec hnique, a kind of geometric tec hniques [24]. CViz uses in teractiv e visualizati on tec hniques to visualize the original data, help the user clean and prepro cess the data, and in terpret the rules disco v ered. CViz also con-ducts n umerical attribute discretization and rule induction to learn classi cation rules based on the training data set. CViz consists of v e comp onen ts, original data visualiza tion , data reduction, n umerical attribute discretization , classi ca-tion rule induction and classi cati on rule visualiza tion . In this section, w e brie y in tro duce the implemen tation of the CViz system and demonstrate our exp erimen t results with the UCI data sets and arti cial data set. The CViz system is implemen ted with Visual C++ 6.0 in terms of the RuleViz mo del. The rst step to visually dis-co v er kno wledge is visualizi ng the original data. CViz as-sumes the training data are represen ted as n -ary tuples. n equidistan t axes are created to b e parallel to one of the screen axes, sa y Y-axis, and corresp ond to the attributes. The axes are scaled to the range of the corresp onding at-tributes and normalized, if necessary . Ev ery tuple corre-sp onds to a p olylin e whic hin tersects eac h of the axes at the p oin t that corresp onds to the v alue for the attribute [22]. Figures 3 and 9 sho ws the e ects of using parallel co-ordinates tec hnique to visualize m ultidimensi onal data sets. Eac h co ordinate is in terpreted further with a list of v alues for a categorical attribute, while a n umerical attribute can b e attac hed with the minim um and maxim um, ev en mean, v ariance, etc. As the algorithm pro ceeds, n umerical in terv als can b e added, includin g the start p oin t and the end p oin t for eac hin terv al and the n um b er of total in terv als once the n umerical attribute is discretized.
 The second comp onen t is to reduce the original data, if nec-essary . Once the original data is visualized on the parallel co ordinates, the user can get a rough idea ab out the data distribution so that data cleaning migh t b e done. The data reduction in v olv es t w o asp ects: horizontal and vertic al re-duction. An attribute that the user thinks irrelev an tto the kno wledge disco v ery can b e in teractiv ely remo v ed b y \deleting-cli c k", th usthedataisv ertically reduced. While an attribute v alue can b e deleted if the distribution of the data tuples passing the v alue is to o sparse, th us the data tuples that ha v e this v alue could b e remo v ed so that the data is horizon tall y reduced. The data reduction is highly dep enden t on the user [18].
 The third comp onen t is to discretize n umerical (con tin uous) attributes. The CViz system pro vides three approac hes: e qui-length , bin-p ackin gb ase d metho d [19], and entr opy-b ase d metho d ED A-DB [4]. The user can select the metho d that he/she lik es, or select all of them for di eren t learning runs for comparison of the learning results. The discretized at-tributes are visualized again where an attribute in terv al cor-resp onds to a p oin t on the attribute co ordinate. Figures 4 and 10 sho w the discretized parallel co ordinates.
 F or the pattern disco v ery , a rule induction algorithm, ELEM2, is used to learn classi cati on rules [3]. ELEM2 conducts a general-to-sp eci c heuristic searc ho v er a h yp othesis space to sequen tiall y generate a disjunctiv e set of prop ositiona l rules for eac h class. It uses a se quential c overing learning strategy to reduce the problem of learning a disjunctiv eset of rules to a sequence of simpler problems, eac h requiring that a single conjunctiv e rule b e learned that co v ers a sub-set of p ositiv e examples.
 The last comp onen t is the visualizati on of the disco v ered classi cation rules. The nal rules are displa y ed as colored strips (p olygons), and the rule accuracy and rule qualit yare used to render the rule p olygons .Eac h rule is illustrated b y a subset of co ordinates with corresp onding v alues and/or in terv als. The co ordinates in the subset are connected to-gether through the v alues or in terv als. The rule accuracy and qualit yv alues are used to render the rule strips. If man y rules are obtained and visualized on a same picture, it is hard to distinguish them. CViz allo ws user to sp ecify a class lab el to view all rules that ha v e this class lab el as the decision v alue. Additionally , the rule prediction accu-racy and rule qualit y are used to con trol the displa y of the disco v ered rules to a v oid clutter. Tw o sliders are used to set the range of rule accuracy , and one slider is used to sp ecify the rule qualit y threshold. If these con trol sliders are set, only can the rules with accuracy in the accuracy range and qualit y higher than the qualit y threshold b e displa y ed. As the sliders mo v e, the displa y ed rules c hange. The basic idea of visualizi ng classi cation rules in the CViz system is to represen t a rule as a strip, called rule p olygon , whic hco v ers the area that connects the corresp onding at-tribute v alues. A classi cati on rule induced b y the ELEM2 algorithm is a logical statemen t that consists of t w o parts: c ondition p art and de cision p art .The de cision part is simply the class lab el. The c ondition part is comp osed of a set of simple relations, eac h of whic h has the format of &lt;a;r ;v &gt; as ab o v e, where r 2f = ; != g and v is a set of v alues of a if a is a categorical attribute, or r 2f &lt; = ;&gt;; 2g and v is a single v alue for &lt; =and &gt; or a pair of v alues for 2 if a is an umerical attribute. The follo wing is the explanation for eac h relational op erator. ;p according to a sp eci c v alue; ;p according to an in terv al; ;p 3 according to a sp eci c v alue; ;p 3 according to an in terv al; F or example, the follo wing is a classi catio n rule obtained in our exp erimen t with an arti cial data set, and is visualized in Figure 11: This rule means that if n umerical attributes A ge and Sc or e ha v ev alues b et w een 30 and 60 and b et w een 1 : 5 and 3 : 5, resp ectiv ely , and categorical attribute Color has v alue red or yellow , then the instance will b e in class bad . The corre-sp onding rule p olygon consists of t w o p olygons whic h are en-closed b y the p oin ts that corresp ond to v alue red and yellow on co ordinate Color , resp ectiv ely , the p oin ts corresp ond to 30 and 60 on co ordinate A ge , the p oin ts that corresp ond to 1 : 5 and 3 : 5 on co ordinate Sc or e , and the p oin t corresp onding to class bad on the decision co ordinate. Actually ,abo v erule can b e logically decomp osed in to t w o equiv alen t rules, cor-resp onding to &lt;Color = red &gt; and &lt; C ol or = yellow &gt; , resp ectiv ely .
 The rule p olygon is constructed b ya rule p olygon gener ating pro cedure, whic hdra ws the rule strip from the co ordinate corresp onding to the rst condition to the decision co ordi-nate in terms of the condition part and is depicted in Figure 2.

The IRIS data are represen ted b y only con tin uous attributes ex-cept the class lab el, while the Monk data set consists of only discrete attributes. In the arti cial data set, w e design it con tains b oth n umerical and discrete attributes. The IRIS data set con tains three classes of iris plan ts with 50 ob jects b elonging to eac h class. One of the iris t yp es is linearly separable from the other t w o while the other t w o are not linearly separable from eac h other. Eac hobjectis describ ed b yfourn umerical attributes, sep al-leng th, sep al-width, p etal-length , and p etal-width . Three classes are IRIS Setosa, IRIS V ersicolor, and IRIS Virginica.
 Figures 3 through 7 demonstrate the exp erimen tal results with the IRIS data set. Figure 3 is the original data visu-alization, while Figure 4 is the visualiza tion of discretized Figure 4: The IRIS attributes discretization with ED A-DB metho d n umerical attributes with ED A-DB metho d. F rom Figure 4, w e see that four n umerical attributes are discretized in to di eren tn um ber of in terv als with di eren twidth. F or ex-ample, attribute p etal-width is discretized in to eigh t disjoin t in terv als, and the b oundary p oin ts are 0 : 0, 0 : 6, 1 : 3, 1 : 4, 1 : 5, 1 : 6, 1 : 7, 1 : 8, and 2 : 5, resp ectiv ely . Figure 5 sho ws all rules that ELEM2 learns from the IRIS data sets, whic hin-v olv es eigh t classi cation rules, including four rules for class 3 , three rules for class 2 , and one rule for class 1 ,respec-tiv ely . Figure 6 illustrates all rules for class 2 disco v ered from the IRIS data set, and the rules for class 1 and class 3 disco v ered from the IRIS data set ha v e the similar displa y form. Figure 7 sho ws the rules for class 2 with accuracy greater than 90%, and qualit y greater than 85%. F rom Fig-ure 7, it is easy to see w e obtain t w o rules that satisfy the accuracy and qualit y sp eci cation through sliders, whic hare Figure 7: The rules for IRIS class 2 with qualit y greater than 85% and W e also exp erimen t the CViz system with the Monk-1 data set, whic h consists of a set of rob ots describ ed b y six at-tributes: head shap es, b o dy shap es, facial expressions, ob-jects b eing held, jac k et colors, and whether or not the rob ot is w earing a tie. The last attribute is a decision attribute (whether a rob ot b elongs to a p ositiv e or negativ e class). This data set con tains 432 examples. The rules obtained are illustrated in Figure 8, from whic hw e can see there are nine classi cation rules where v e rules are for class 0 (neg-ativ e class) and four rules for class 1 (p ositiv e class). An arti cial data set is designed to in v olv et w on umerical attributes A ge and Sc or e , one condition categorical attribute Color , and one decision categorical attribute Class . A ge is of in teger t yp e and has range [0 ; 90]. Sc or e is of real-v alued t yp e and has range [0 : 0 ; 5 : 0]. Color has four discrete v alues: r e d, blue, yel low ,and gr e en . The decision attribute has t w o class lab els: go o d and b ad . The relationship b et w een the class lab els and the condition attributes in the data set is designed as follo ws: Figures 9 through 13 illustrate the exp erimen t with the arti-cial data set. Figure 9 visualizes the original arti cial data, and Figure 10 is the result of discretizing the n umerical at-tributes A ge and Sc or e with ED A-DB metho d [4]. Figure 11 illustrates all disco v ered rules, includin g one rule for class b ad and three rules for class go o d , whic h are the same as our designation and corresp ond to the follo wing three con-ditions: Figure 10: The n umerical attributes discretization of the arti cial data set Figure 12 sho ws, w eha v e only t w o rules with accuracy b e-t w een 90% and 95% and qualit y greater than 90%, one for class go o d , one for class b ad . While Figure 13 illustrates the rules for class go o d with accuracy greater than 95%. RuleViz is an in teractiv e mo del for visualizi ng the pro cess of kno wledge disco v ery in databases. This mo del consists of v e comp onen ts, original data visualizatio n, visual data re-duction, visual data prepro cess, pattern disco v ery , and pat-tern visualizati on. The basic idea is to use visualizati on tec hniques to dra w the original data and get insigh tin to the data distribution , in tuitiv ely limit the domain of data b yin teraction, then disco v er rules from the reduced data, and nally visualize the resulting kno wledge. Tw o asp ects are addressed. One is the in teraction b et w een the h uman Figure 11: All rules disco v ered with arti cial data set Figure 12: The rules from arti cial data with accu-racy b et w een 90% and 95% Figure 13: The rules for the go o d class with accuracy bet w een 95% and 100% and the mac hine, and the other is the visualizati on of eac h comp onen t. The in teraction helps the KDD system na vi-gate through the enormous searc h spaces and recognize the in ten tions of the user, and the visualizati on of the KDD pro cess helps users gain b etter insigh tin to the m ultidimen-sional data, understand the in termediate results, and in ter-pret the disco v ered patterns. The information visualizati on tec hniques can b e used for visualizin g eac h comp onen t, but new tec hniques for in teractiv e visualizati on should b e dev el-op ed.
 According to the RuleViz mo del, an in teractiv e visualiza -tion system, CViz, for visualizi ng the pro cess of classi ca-tion rule induction is dev elop ed. In our implemen tation , w e emphasize the h uman-mac hine in teraction, since w ebe-liev e that in teractiv e visualizatio n pla ys an imp ortan t role in data mining and mac hine learning to guide the pro cess of disco v ering kno wledge. The exp erimen tal results with the UCI data, and arti cial data ha v e also demonstrated that it is useful for users to understand the relationshi ps among data and to concen trate on the in teresting data to disco v er kno wledge.
 Enhancing the CViz system, dev eloping other systems for visually disco v ering other t yp es of kno wledge, and nally in-tegrating these systems under the RuleViz mo del constitute our next w ork. The capabili ties of CViz will b e impro v ed with other visualizati on tec hniques and expanded to pro vide more in teractiv e to ols for the data prepro cess, suc h as in-teractiv ely dra wing clusters so that the clustering problem can b e transformed to classi cation problems. W e are also adapting the CViz system to other rule-based learning sys-tems so that CViz con tains man y rule induction algorithms for di eren t domains. Other in teractiv e systems based on the RuleViz mo del are b eing dev elop ed to visualize the pro-cess of mining asso ciation rules, ev olution rules, etc. The authors are mem b ers of the Institute for Rob otics and In telligen t Systems (IRIS) and wish to ac kno wledge the sup-p ort of the Net w orks of Cen ters of Excellence Program of the Go v ernmen t of Canada, the Natural Sciences and Engineer-ing Researc h Council, and the participation of PRECARN Asso ciates Inc.
