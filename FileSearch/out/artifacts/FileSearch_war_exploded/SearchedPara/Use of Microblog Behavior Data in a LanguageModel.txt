 Recent years have seen the emergence of personalized Web search as an effective approach to deal with the diversity present in users X  information needs [ 15 , 18 , 23 ]. This diversity arises as a result of differences in users X  preferences and interests and often leads to different search results satisfying different users even when the issued query is the same 1 [ 19 ]. The personalization process within Web search involves incorporation of user X  X  preferences into the retrieval model of the search system thereby moving from a  X  X ne size fits all X  approach to customization of search results for people with different information interests and goals. built from a user X  X  search history (e.g., query logs and clickthrough data) and browsing history [ 7 , 12 , 17 ]. However, use of such history data is not feasible on account of users X  privacy considerations which limit the availability of the data and furthermore, history data is more prone to noise as previous interactions with the search system are not necessarily reflective of current user needs [ 22 ]. This paper therefore argues for an alternative information source (namely, microblogs) from which to build a rich user profile.
 The proliferation of Web 2.0 services has created a new form of user col-laboration where users engage within a social network while at the same time generating their own content which is popularly known as user-generated con-tent. Microblogs such as Twitter 2 are an immensely popular forum for such collaboration and we explore their worth as a source of user profile data for the Web search personalization process. Earlier research efforts that aim to exploit information from online social systems for personalized search rely mostly on social bookmarking and tagging systems [ 14 , 20 ]. However, Heymann et al. [ 9 ] questioned the usability of bookmarking meta-data for Web search engines by collecting a very large dataset (in fact, the largest known to the academic com-munity) from a social bookmarking site. Heymann et al. X  X  findings revealed that social bookmarking lacks the size and distribution of tags necessary to make a significant impact for information retrieval at large. This is further confirmed in a user-survey based study by Younus et al. [ 25 ] revealing a very low usage of social bookmarking sites as compared to other social networking tools. To the best of our knowledge, the use of microblogging platforms and, in particular, Twitter has not, with the exception of a few works [ 10 , 26 ], been explored as a source of user profile construction for personalized Web search and we undertake such a direction in this work. Our paper makes the following contributions: 1. We propose a statistical language modeling approach for user profile construc-tion which takes into account various features of a user X  X  Twitter network and his behavior on Twitter. This extends previous work [ 26 ] in that the model also considers the Twitterers followed by a user whereas previous work only considered the Twitterers mentioned and retweeted by a user. 2. As a further extension from previous work [ 26 ], we attempt to achieve an optimization of the model X  X  parameters by introducing the concept of  X  X rust scores X  between a user and his/her Twitter network. These trust scores are derived based on various aspects of a user X  X  Twitter X  X  activities (i.e., mentions and retweets). 3. We propose different weighting strategies within the language model based on a user X  X  similarity with his/her Twitter network. We extend previous work [ 26 ] by taking into account topical similarity measures instead of solely rely-ing on network-based similarity. We additionally enhance the model through application of similarity-based weights instead of relying on a binary inclusion decision 3 . 4. We perform extensive evaluations with other personalization approaches pro-works that are related to our research along with an explanation of how we dif-fer from past work. In Sect. 3 , we define the proposed methodology in sufficient detail. In Sect. 4 , we discuss different variants within the parameters of the pro-posed personalization model based on a user X  X  Twitter behavior and derived trust scores . In Sect. 5 , we present the experimental evaluations. Finally in Sect. 6 ,we provide some conclusions with a discussion on implications of our findings. As described previously, the majority of efforts aimed at Web search personal-ization have attempted to model user preferences through the use of search and browse history data. These approaches are further classified based on whether the history data reflects a user X  X  short-term [ 6 , 16 ] or long-term [ 12 , 17 ] prefer-ences. History based approaches introduce major privacy concerns for users and based on psychological reasons the problem persists even with client-side per-sonalization approaches [ 6 ]. The work by Teevan et al. examines a variety of sources (e.g. documents on user X  X  hard drive, emails and so forth) in addition to history data to build a rich model of user interests. However, emails and desktop documents also contain sensitive information which users may not be willing to share with the search system.
 tems as an alternative for user profile construction in the Web search person-alization process with most of the approaches relying on social bookmarks and tags [ 2 , 14 ]. Approaches by Noll and Meinel [ 14 ] utilize the notion of frequency of occurrence for tags that users apply to resources (in this case web documents) in order to define a user-document similarity measure that re-ranks the search results. Vallet et al. [ 20 ] also utilize a user-document similarity measure based on the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf ) scheme in which both the tf-idf weights in the user space and document space are calculated for com-putation of a joint similarity measure. A recent approach by Bouadjenek et al. [ 3 ] uses the social bookmarks assigned to documents in a collaborative filtering setting in order to take into account tags used by similar users. Other approaches that do not solely rely on social bookmarks and also take into account social net-works of users remain limited to enterprise settings and hence, find limited use in Web search engines [ 5 , 22 ]. More recently, some efforts have attempted to undertake the process of user profile construction from Twitter data [ 1 , 13 , 21 ]. Of these approaches, some attempt to construct Twitter-based user profiles through semantic enrichment of tweet messages. As an example Abel et al. [ 1 ] apply a weighting heuristic to three types of user profiles: entity-based, topic-based and hashtag-based which is then tested in a personalized news recommendation system. Similarly, Meij et al. [ 13 ] utilize machine learning over a Wikipedia-based rich feature set to identify Wikipedia concepts in tweets. Another class of approaches aims to eliminate the information overload problem within the expanding microblogging site Twitter through recommendation of useful Twitter messages according to users X  interests [ 11 , 24 ]. Despite the fact that the research community within text mining and information retrieval has turned its attention towards construction of Twitter-based user profiles, its use remains limited to recommendation systems and to the best of our knowledge the work by Ameni et al. is the first to utilize data collected from Twitter for Web search personalization [ 10 ]. This section describes the proposed personalization model in detail. We follow a strategy in which non-personalized search results returned from a search system are re-ranked with the help of the user profile to return results that are more relevant to the user [ 17 ]. 3.1 Microblog Behavior Based Language Model We adopt a statistical language model to model various aspects of Twitter behav-ior. Using this model, we then define our re-ranking approach. We first present a brief overview of the Twitter-specific behaviors after which the formulations for re-ranking search results are presented.
 The Twitter microblog network enables a user to follow any other user and unlike most online social networking sites the relationships of following and being followed require no reciprocation. Being a follower on Twitter enables a user to receive all the messages (called tweets) from those members the user follows. Twitter presents the opportunity to users to post 140-character long status updates about a variety of topics. Twitter also enables users to engage in con-versations with each other through a feature known as mentions while at the same time allowing users to share a tweet written by another Twitter user with his/her followers through a feature known as retweets . We incorporate the men-tion , retweet and follow features of Twitter within our model with the underlying intuition that those Twitterers a particular user mentions, retweets or follows may reflect, to a large extent, the user X  X  own preferences and interests. the likelihood of generating a document d from a language model estimated from a user X  X  Twitter model as follows: system (i.e., d ), W the set of all the words in the title and snippet of document d , n(w,d) the term frequency of w in d ,and u is the user for whom we want to personalize Web search results. Here, T is used to represent the uniform mixture of the user X  X  Twitter model as follows: by those Twitterers whom the user u mentions (i.e., Twitterers in set U T U r denotes the tweets by those Twitterers whom the user u retweets (i.e., Twitterers in set U r ) and T U f denotes the tweets by those Twitterers whom the user u follow (i.e., Twitterers in set U f ). The individual Twitter models can be estimated as: those Twitterer X  X  tweets whom the user mentions, those Twitterers X  tweets whom the user retweets and those Twitterers X  tweets whom the user follows. Note that sim(u,u i ) in Eqs. ( 4 ) X ( 6 ) denotes the similarity between a target user u for whom we want to personalize search results 5 and each user u i U r or U f . We explore a range of similarity measures in the next subsection. The constituent language models for T o ,T U m ,T U r and T mixture of their tweets X  language models employing Dirichlet prior smoothing: where n(w,.) denotes the frequency of word w in (.), col l is short for collection which refers to all tweets by user u (in case of Eq. ( 3 )), all tweets by Twitterers in set U m (in case of Eq. ( 4 )) and all tweets by Twitterers in set U Eq. ( 5 )), and | . | is the overall length of the tweet or the collection. Finally, after estimation of a user X  X  Twitter model (using Eqs. 3  X  6 )weuse Eq. ( 1 ) to re-rank the documents returned by a search system and hence, present personalized search results to the user u . 3.2 Similarity Measure Between Users The previous subsection presented the language modeling framework employed for the purpose of search results re-ranking which utilized the essential compo-nent of a similarity measure between the target user and the user in his/her Twitter network (more specifically, the user in mention, retweet or following network). We propose two classes of similarity measures based on the following intuitions:  X  Two users are more likely to have common preferences and interests if they share many users within their Twitter network and hence, we propose network-based similarity measures.  X  Two users are more likely to have common preferences and interests if they share interests in the same topics and hence, we propose topical similarity measures.
 Network-Based Similarity: Previously, we defined U m as the set of users mentioned by u , U r as the set of users whose tweets were retweeted by user u and U f as the set of users whose tweets were followed by user u .Wepresenta network-based similarity measure which we then use as a weighing heuristic for a particular user in U m , U r or U f .
 We calculate the similarity between the current user u and each user u occurring in either U m , U r or U f based on the heuristic that the more people u follows in these sets, the more likely that user X  X  interests overlap with the user u . Furthermore, we normalise this score by the maximum of total number of users that user u i follows or the number of users in U m , U r formula to calculate the similarity score between user u and a user u where follow(u i ) is the set of users followed by u i .
 approach.
 Topical Similarity: For the definition of topical similarity we make use of the Twitter-LDA model [ 27 ] in order to obtain the topics from tweets of all the users in sets U m , U r and U f . It is significant to note that Twitter-LDA differs from the original LDA framework in that a single tweet is assigned a single topic instead of a distribution over topics 6 . We use the Twitter-LDA to determine the tweets X  topics which are then utilized in a probabilistic model to determine topical similarity between a target user and a user in U m
Sim ( u, u i )= related to topic j, n(topic j , Topic U m ) denotes the number of tweets by users in set U m related to topic j, and t u denotes the total number of tweets by the target user u . The topical similarity measure is essentially a weighted average of the commonality between topical distributions of a target user and the users in his/her network and is hence a good indication of shared preferences and interests.
 approach. This section outlines the parameter setting heuristics that are derived based on the behavior of a target user on the Twitter social network. More specifically, we apply a Page-Rank like intuition over the network of users followed by the target user. Furthermore, depending on the amount of mentions and retweets within the tweets of a user we determine  X  X rust scores X  which are used as parameters for the model (  X  o ,  X  m and  X  r in Eq. ( 2 )). 4.1 Random Surfer Behavior on Twitter Network As explained in Sect. 3.1 the proposed model takes into account those Twitterers X  tweets whom the user mentions, whom the user retweets and whom the user follows. However, the likelihood that the Twitterers followed by a target user reflect his/her preferences is less unless the target user mentions or retweets the Twitterer followed 7 . The model already incorporates the mention and retweet network and hence, the likelihood that the target user is interested in a followed Twitterer mimics the  X  X andom surfer model X  where the random surfer gets bored after several mentions and retweets and switches to a random followed Twitterer. Based on this intuition, we propose the following parameterization for  X   X  and  X  f Here,  X  represents the damping factor which is basically the probability of the target user X  X  interests being reflected by Twitterers mentioned or retweeted. We set the damping factor to 0.85 which is the standard value used by the PageRank algorithm giving the value for  X  f of 0.15. 4.2 Trust Scores Based on Tweeting Activities Users differ in their behavior on Twitter in that some actively engage in conver-sations through the mention feature while others diffuse information in the form of retweets [ 4 ]. These differences in behavior form the basis for  X  X rust scores X  within our model. The  X  X rust scores X  measure the proportion of the target user X  X  own tweets, tweets in which he or she engages in the mention activity and tweets in which he or she engages in the retweet activity. More precisely we set the para-meters  X  o ,  X  m ,  X  r as follows where, t o represents original tweets by the target user, t by the target user in which he/she engages in the mention activity and t resents those tweets by the target user in which he/she engages in the retweet activity. In this section we describe our experimental evaluations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In the first step we perform an offline evaluation using user-defined relevance judgements, and in the second step we perform interleaved evaluations which as demonstrated by Matthijs and Radlin-ski [ 12 ] is an effective method for evaluation of real user workload on search systems. We test various variations of our system (i.e., the two different simi-larity measures of Sect. 3.2 and the different parameter settings) expressed by short-hand notation of Table 1 .
 in addition to the approach by Matthijs and Radlinski [ 12 ]. However, we replace the search and browsing history data of these approaches by tweets of the target user and his/her network due to the limitation of such history data not being available. 5.1 Experimental Setup We recruited 84 active Twitter users and used their Twitter data for the purpose of experimental evaluations. We obtained the search queries and underlying cor-pus (i.e., search documents X  collection) from a publicly available dataset called  X  X iteData X  by Harpale et al. [ 8 ]. CiteData comprises 81,432 academic articles and 41 queries. The dataset also contains relevance judgements which we do not use on account of them not being truly reflective of personalized relevance judge-ments and furthermore, the relevance judgements are not graded which makes it impossible to calculate normalized discounted cumulative gain.
 of the queries that were similar to a search query that he/she had issued at some point. Each user was asked to select 12 queries from the 41 queries of the dataset and the re-ranked results were graded as highly relevant (2), relevant (1) and non-relevant (0). We re-rank the top-50 search results obtained through a non-personalized BM25 retrieval model.
 uation and this is to estimate the performance of our system on real users with real information needs so as to ensure that the results of offline evaluation do not overfit to the dataset. A browser plugin was developed and 16 out of the 84 users who participated in the offline evaluation agreed to participate in the online evaluation. We performed the interleaved evaluation over a two-week period for the 16 users and we follow the approach similar to Matthijs and Radlinski [ 12 ]. Search results from Google were re-ranked and the two rankings i.e., the origi-nal one from Google and the one produced after re-ranking by our system were interleaved to ensure that a click at random would be equally likely to be on a result from either ranking. 5.2 Experimental Results Once we obtain relevance judgements and clickthrough data for both set of exper-iments, we evaluate the performance of our proposed personalization model using the evaluation metrics of mean average precision (MAP), precision at top 10 doc-uments (P@10) and normalized discounted cumulative gain at top 10 documents (NDCG@10) which respectively measure the system X  X  overall retrieval accuracy, its performance for those documents that are most viewed and the overall ranking positions of relevant/highly relevant documents. Table 2 shows the experimental results for the offline evaluation i.e. MAP, P@10 and NDCG@10 values for the various variants of our approach (using notations of Table 1 ), and other person-alization approaches (denoted by Teevan and Matthijs ) 8 . We report the results together across the queries and judgements for all 84 users who took part in the offline evaluation.
 The results for the offline evaluation show clearly, the benefits of using Twit-ter data to personalize search results for users. Furthermore, the MAP, P@10 and NDCG@10 scores for the personalized results corresponding to LM best performance effectively implying that topical similarity between the target user and his/her network is likely to lead to greater user satisfaction during the information-seeking process. Additionally, the incorporation of Twitter behavior in the form of trust scores outperforms the uniform weighting schemes. and of these 489 queries received a click on a search result. Of these 489 queries, 302 (61.8 %) queries received higher votes across our personalization model while the remaining 187 (38.2 %) received higher votes across the original Google rankings. This again demonstrates the potential for search personalization based on Twitter data to improve the search experience. Note that we only personalize using the vari-ant that performs best in the offline evaluation (i.e., the one denoted by LM The main conclusion is that exploiting evidence available from a person X  X  microblog behaviour to allow personalization can improve the accuracy of a system. We adopt a language modeling approach and show that including a sim-ilarity measure based on shared topical interests from a user X  X  Twitter network provides the best performance. Moreover, taking into account a user X  X  social network behavior leads to a rich model that dynamically adjusts parameters optimally. Future work will involve a combination of search history data and browsing history data to enable us to merge the social sources of evidence with more richer evidences of user profile information.
