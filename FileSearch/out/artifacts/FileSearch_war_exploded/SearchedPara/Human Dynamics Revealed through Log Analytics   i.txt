 Human behaviors have drawn great interests from researchers in various academic disciplines, including psychology, sociology, economics and anthropology. Gaining insights into human behaviors, however, remains a challenge because of the underly-ing complexity and intangibility. Given web technologies have permeated into nearly every aspect of society, people have started to model and understand human behaviors through readily available massive data on the web. For instance, researchers have worked on better understanding human navigation patterns in terms of visiting web pages and communication patterns between users and web sites so that they could enhance user experiences of common navi gational activities [1][2]. Furthermore, popular online social networks, including Facebook, Twitter and Sina Weibo, provide yet another kind of platforms for observing human behaviors. Gaining extra insights into human behaviors through describing and analyzing human online behaviors mathematically could have important implications in online resource management, service allocation and other applications. 
One frequently observed form of human dynamics is temporal patterns generated by human behaviors. Conventionally, people assumed that the time property of an individual X  X  activity pattern following a Poisson process. Recent theoretical analyses and empirical studies, however, showed that the timing of various human activities follows the power law at both the entire population level and an individual level [3][4][5][6][7]. In particular, according to Barab X si [3], many human activities have burst nature that can be modeled as a task-driven queuing process with a highest-priority-first (HPF) protocol deciding which task needs to be executed first. On the other hand, researchers have looked into using interest-based models [4], which also show heavy-tailed distribution, to explain human activity patterns: watching online movies [5], browsing the web [6], and playing online games [7]. 
Even in the latest computing paradigm, Cloud Computing, people started to inves-tigate various ways to utilize human behaviors. Viewing computation as a utility, Cloud Computing, has garnered a great interest from people from different domains because of its unique features including elasticity, on demand service and pay-as-you-go. The Cloud Computing system, however, is prone to performance anomalies due to its inherent complexity. To overcome this obstacle, people have conducted user beha-vior analyses at different levels of Cloud Computing system, including cloud compu-ting system performance, security, and deployment strategies [8][9]. Amazon cloud services also benefitted from improving the custom relationship by tracking and monitoring activities of each individual user. Few people, however, have looked into the relationship between human dynamics in the real world and their behaviors in Cloud Computing environment. In this paper, we aim to investigate this topic by studying human dynamics of college students at Hefei University of Technology through log analytics in a private storage cloud called MeePo. MeePo system, providing private cloud storage service, is designed and implemented by Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology of Tsing-hua University. MeePo is targeted at staff and students in a university providing stable storage service freely. In particular, MeePo system offers three types of services: public storage service, community storage se rvice and individual storage service [11]. More specifically, public space mainly provides data sharing service for all MeePo users; community space offers data storage service and data sharing service for a spe-cific group of users; private space just serves an individual user with certain privileg-es. MeePo system has been successfully running in Tsinghua University, Lanzhou University and Hefei University of Technology. 
Our experimental data are server log files collected come from MeePo system dep-loyed at Hefei University of Technology which we name it HFUT-MeePo for conven-ience. Overall, HFUT-MeePo offers three types of storage services: 1) public space, including 7 categories: study, movie, TV, music, comic, game and software; 2) com-munity space, registered and accessed by a group of users, who share similar interests or belong to the same association; and 3) private space, storing personal data. 
Experimental data were collected over a 159-day period that goes from 24th May, 2012 to 31st October, 2012, in which two-day data are excluded because of power failure. The log file format of HFUT-MeePo is: [time; function responses to user op-erations; user operation; user email; requested resource location]. In this section, we study the activity pattern of the entire user population of HFUT-MeePo system. At this time, there are 3,000 users that have registered and utilized MeePo cloud service. All log files stored in cloud platform are collected in order to analyze what user behaviors in terms of daily, weekly and monthly activities. How user behaviors may correspond to regular school affairs including statutory holidays for university staff and students are also studied. 
Taking number of service accesses as a measurement unit, we look into how this measurement changes during a week. In general, with the unceasing change of the busy degree in a week, the number of service access will change correspondingly; and people often associate Monday as the busiest and worst day of a week. However, it doesn X  X  seem to be the case. A survey suggests that it X  X  worse off on Tuesday than Monday, both in terms of stress levels and workload [12]. In our analysis, the weekly average of the number of service access during the whole period is shown in Fig. 1. It shows that Tuesday is the least active day in a week, while the activity degree is in-creasing from then on and reaches a peak on Thursday. Interestingly, the level of activity on Friday and Saturday is similar to that on Wednesday. Meanwhile, we also provide the variation trend of the number of service access during the holiday break of Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day. As shown in Fig. 1, the first green dotted line represents the Mid-Autumn Day, followed by the National Day, a seven-day-holiday. It X  X  worthwhile to note that the trend of this period is different when com-pared with the weekly average before the Mid-Autumn Day. Furthermore, we observe that there was a sudden decrease in the first two days of the National Day holidays and the quietest period is actually in the middle of the holidays. This maps to the physical world pretty closely: most users started to leave campus when the National Days started and gradually returned to campus and started to use HFUT-MeePo system again towards the end of the holidays. 
Human circadian rhythms, a human nature, are one of reasons for inhomogeneity of human behaviors [10]. In order to study human circadian rhythms in HFUT-MeePo system, we look into how user behaviors change from one hour to another in a day by averaging the user visits hourly over all weeks as shown in Fig. 2. We can see that on workdays, the 12th Hour and the 13th Hour are the most active period due to the lunch break and with the activity gradually increasing from the 16th Hour until mid-night. As a whole, the trend shown in Fig. 2 well reflects the circadian rhythms of the college students at HFUT. More students stay late on Saturdays between the 0th Hour to the 7th Hour than those on Workdays and Sundays. Correspondingly, Saturdays see fewer students active between the 14th Hour to the 19th Hour compared to those on Workdays and Sundays. On Sundays, MeePo system sees more user activities because people are getting ready for the coming week. In the preceding section, we discuss the collective behavior of the population during 159 days. To shed more lights on activity patterns, we inspect individual activities in this section. When we observe seven categories of Public space in HFUT-MeePo system, there are several significant activity peaks in the total visits during the whole study period, specifically for the Study category which is one of the seven categories of Public space. One peak occurred between June 15th and July 1st. Intuitively, we thought that some important things about learning might occur at that time. How-ever, through careful analyses of the 14 areas of Study category, we find that the peak is caused by one individual. On the basis of the amount of Read operation that this user did, we ascertain that the cause of the high-traffic is not evoked by some kinds of programs and it is further confirmed by the communication with this user via email. 
To further investigate the skew phenomenon of individual activities, we utilize time interval between two consecutive visits of a single user to MeePo in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) shows the probability dense function (PDF) of time interval between two consec-utive visits of one user. Meanwhile, Fig. 3(b) shows the cumulative distribution func-can be well fitted by a power-law, P (t)  X  t -2.21 (the dotted line in the log-log pot has the slope -2.21), which means the distribution of session length fits the power-law with the exponent -1.21. Note that the total number of events is 50 during 10 5 time steps. The burst nature of human dynamics was first proposed in 2005 by Albert-L X szl X  Barab X si [3]. A lot of evidences indicate that the timing of numerous human activities follows non-Poisson statistics, and is characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by a long time of inactivity. Using the queuing process, Barab X si tasks will be executed rapidly, while few tasks with low priority will wait a long time. In addition to the task-based mechanism, th e interest-based model is proposed in [13]. In this model, the quasi-periodic change of interest will affect the frequency of events, and vice versa. It can generate the power-law inter-event time distribution with expo-nent of value -1 based on the interest. In our study, Fig. 3 (b) can be well illustrated according to the interest-based model. When a user browses data stored in MeePo system, we prefer to think that this user X  X  behavior is based on his/her personal prefe-rences. If some files of a particular group are attractive to a user, this user is likely to visit other documents in this group; on the other hand, this user X  X  interests, i.e. visits, will continue grow until reaching a saturation point. Once this happens, visits will be reduced significantly for a prolonged period of time. Hence, analysis to the time in-terval between consecutive visits can contribute to a better understanding of human dynamic. In this paper, we study human dynamics by analyzing log files of MeePo system, a private cloud storage service, deployed at Hefei University of Technology. First of all, we investigate the activity pattern of the entire population. We compare the MeePo service access trend between the weekly average and the holiday week during the break of Mid-Autumn festival and National Day holidays. Analysis results indicate that how people spend their holidays in the physical world reflected in their online activities which show rather different trend comparing to the regular week. Further-more, analyzing the weekly average activities and hourly average activities clearly reveal human circadian rhythms and weekly cycles. Second, because of our own ob-servation of the burst of visited caused by one user, we investigate the interval time between consecutive events based on Barab X si X  X  theory. We find that visits to MeePo system follow interest-based model instead of Barab X si X  X  task-driven model. 
In the near future, we plan to collect and analyze more data from MeePo system deployed at other universities, including Tsinghua University and Lanzhou Universi-ty. We can then explore whether human dynamics revealed through log analytics vary from one campus to another. Acknowledgements.
