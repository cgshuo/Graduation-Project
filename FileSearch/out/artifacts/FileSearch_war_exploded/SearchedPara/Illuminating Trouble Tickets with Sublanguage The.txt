 Corporate information systems that manage cus-tomer reports of problems with products or ser-vices have become common nowadays. Yet, the vast amount of data accumulated by these systems remains underutilized for the purposes of gaining proactive, adaptive insight s into companies X  busi-ness operations. 
Unsurprising, then, is an increased interest by organizations in knowledge mining approaches to master this information for quality assurance or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) pur-poses. Recent commercial developments include pattern-based extraction of important entities and relationships in the automotive domain (Attensity, 2003) and text mining applications in the aviation domain (Provalis, 2005). 
This paper describes an exploratory feasibility study conducted for a large utility provider. The company was interested in knowledge discovery approaches applicable to the data aggregated by its Emergency Control System (ECS) in the form of field service tickets. When a  X  X roblem X  in the company X  X  electric, gas or steam distribution sys-tem is reported to the corporate Call Center, a new ticket is created. A typical ticket contains the original report of the problem and steps taken to fix it. An operator also assigns a ticket an Original Trouble Type, which can be changed later, as addi-tional information clarifies the nature of the prob-lem. The last Trouble Type assigned to a ticket becomes its Actual Trouble Type. 
Each ticket combines structured and unstruc-tured data. The structured portion comes from sev-eral internal corporate information systems. The unstructured portion is entered by the operator who receives information over the phone from a person reporting a problem or a field worker fixing it. This free text constitutes the main material for the analysis, currently limited to known -item search using keywords and a few patterns. The company management grew dissatisfied with such an ap-proach as time-consuming and, likely, missing out on emergent threats and opportunities or discover-ing them too late. Furthermore, this approach lacks the ability to knit facts together across trouble tickets, except for grouping them by date or gross attributes, such as Trouble Types. The company management felt the need for a system, which, based on the semantic analysis of ticket texts, would not only identify items of interest at a more granular level, such as events, people, locations, dates, relationships, etc., but would also enable the discovery of unanticipated associations and trends. 
The feasibility study aimed to determine whether NLP-based approaches could deal with such hom ely , ungrammatical texts and then to ex-plore various knowledge mining techniques that would meet the client X  X  needs. Initial an aly sis of a sam ple of data suggested that the goa l could be effectively acco mplished by looki ng at the data from the perspective of sublanguage the ory. 
The novelt y of our work is in co mbining sy m-bolic NLP and statistical approaches, guided by sublanguage theor y, whic h results in an effective methodolog y and solutio n f or such data. 
This paper describes anal yses and experi ments conducted and discusses the potential of the sub-language app roach for the task of tappi ng int o the value of trou ble ticket data . Sublanguage theor y pos its that text s produced within a certain discourse co mmunity exhibit shared, often uncon vent ional, vocab ulary an d grammar (Grish man and Kittredge, 1986; Harris, 1991). Subla nguage theor y has been successfully applied in b iomedicine (Fried man et al., 2002; Lidd y et al., 1993), software developm ent (Etzkorn et al., 1999), weather forecasting (Somers, 2003), and other d omains. Trouble tickets exhibit a spe-cial discour se structure , co mbining sy stem -generated, structured data and free-text sections; a special lexicon, full of acrony ms, abbreviations and sy mbols; and consistent  X  X ending X  o f grammar rules in favo r of speed writing (Joh nson, 199 2; Marlow, 2004). Our work has also been inform ed by the resea rch on m achine classifi cation tech-niques (Joachim s, 2002; Yi lm azel et al., 2005). The client provided us wi th a dataset of 162,105 trouble ticket s dating fro m 1995 to 2 005. An im -portant part of data preprocessing included token-izing text strings. The tokenizer was adapted to fit the special features of the trouble ticket s X  vocabu-lary an d gra mmar: odd punctuation; name variants; dom ain-spe cific ter ms, phr ases, and abbreviations. 
Develop ment of a subl anguage m odel began with manual annotation an d analy sis of a sample o f 73 tickets, supplemented with n-gram analy sis and contextual m ining for particular ter ms a nd phrases. The analy sis aimed to identify consistent linguistic patterns: domain-specific vocabulary (abbrevia-tions, special terms); maj or ticket sections; and semantic com ponents (people, organiz ations, loca-tions, events, important concepts). 
The analy sis resulted in com piling the core do-main lexicon, which inclu des acrony ms for Trou-ble Ty pes ( SMH -smoking m anhole); departm ents ( EDS -Electric Distribution); locations ( S/S/C -South of the South Curb); special terms ( PACM -Possible Asbestos Containing Material); abbrevia-tions ( BSMNT -basement, F/UP -follow up); and fixed phrases ( NO LIGHT S, WHITE HAT ). Origi-nally, the lexicon was intended to supp ort the de-velopm ent of the sublangu age grammar, but, since no such lexicon existed in the co mpany , it can now enhance the corporate knowledge base.

Review of the data reveal ed a consiste nt struc-ture for trouble ticket dis course. A t ypical ticket (Fig.1) co nsists of several text bl ocks ending wit h an operator X  s ID ( 12345 or JS ). A ticket usually opens with a complaint (lines 001-00 2 ) that pro-vides the ori ginal account of a pro blem and often contains: reporting ent ity ( CONST MGMT ), ti me-stam p, short problem description, loc ation. Field work (lines 009-01 0 ) nor mally includes the name of the assigned e mploy ee, new inform ation about the problem , steps needed or taken, com plic ations, etc. Lexical choices ar e li mited a nd section-specific; for instance, reporting a problem ty pically opens with REPORTS, CLAIMS, or CALLED. 
The resulting t ypical struct ure of a tr ouble ticket (Table 1) includes sections distinct in their content and data format. 
Analy sis also identified recurring semantic components: people, locations, problem , time-stam p, equipment, urgency, etc. The a nnotatio n o f tickets by sections (Fig.2 ) and semantic co mpo-nents was validated with d omain experts. 
The analy sis beca me the basis for developing logical rules for autom atic identification of ticket sections and selected sem antic com ponents. Evaluation of sy stem perform ance on 70 manually annotated and 80 unseen tickets dem onstrated high accura cy in automatic se ction identification, with an error rate of onl y 1. 4% , and n o sign ificant dif-ference betw een results on the annotated vs. un-seen ticket s. Next, the aut omatic annot ator was run on the entire corpus of 162,10 5 tickets. The anno-tated dataset was used in further experiments. 
Identification of sem antic co mponents brings together variations in names and spellings under a single  X  X ormalized X  t erm, thus strea mlining and expanding c overage of sub sequent da ta analy sis. For exam ple, strings UNSAFE LADDER, HAZ, (hazard) and PACM (Possi ble Asbestos Containing Material) are tagged and, thus, can be retrieved as hazard indicators.  X  X orma lization X  is also applied to nam e variants for streets and departments. 
The prim ary value of the annotation is in effec-tive extraction of structured inform ation from the se unstructured free texts. Su ch inform atio n can next be fed into a database and integrated with other data attributes for further analy sis. Thi s will sig-nificantly ex pand the ran ge and the c overage of data analy sis techniques, currently em ploy ed by the com pany . 
The high accuracy in automatic identifi cation of ticket section s and semantic co mponents can, to a significant extent, be explained by the relatively lim ited num ber and high consistency of the identi-fied linguisti c constructions, which enabled their succes sful translation into a set of logical rules. This also supported our i nitial view of the ticket texts as exhibiting subl anguage characteristics, such as: distinct shared common vocabulary and constructions; extensive us e of special symbols and abbreviations; and consist ent bendin g of grammar in favor of s horthand . Th e sublanguag e approach thus enables the sy stem to recognize effectively a num ber of implicit sem antic relationships in texts. Next, we assessed the potential of som e knowledge discovery approaches to meet company needs and fit the nature of the data. 4.1 Identifying Related Tick ets When severa l reports relate to the same or recur-ring trouble, or to m ultiple problems affecting the same are a, a note is made in each ticket, e.g.: 
Each of these related tic kets usually contains some aspects of the trouble (Figure 3), but current analy tic appr oaches never broug ht them together to create a co mplete picture of the proble m, which may provide for useful associations . Semantic component related-ticket is expressed through pre-dictable linguistic patterns that can be used as lin-guistic clues for autom atic groupi ng of related tickets for further analy sis. 4.2 Classification experimen ts The analy sis of Trouble T ype distributi on revealed, much to the company X  s surprise, that 18% of tick-ets had the Miscellaneous (MSE) Type and, thus, remained out-of-scope for any analysis of associa-tions between Trouble Types and semantic compo-nents that would reveal trends. A number of reasons may account for this, including uniqueness of a problem or human error. Review of a sample of MSE tickets showed that some of them should have a more specific Trouble Type. For example (Figure 4), both tickets, each initially assigned the MSE type, describe the WL problem, but only one ticket later receives this code. 
Results of n-gram analyses (Liddy et al., 2006), supported our hypothesis that different Trouble Types have distinct linguistic features. Next, we investigated if knowledge of these type-dependent linguistic patterns can help with assigning specific Types to MSE tickets. The task was conceptualized as a multi-label classification, where the system is trained on complaint sections of tickets belonging to specific Trouble Types and then tested on tickets belonging either to these Types or to the MSE Type. Experiments were run using the Extended LibSVM tool (Chang and Lin, 2001), modified for another project of ours (Yilmazel et al., 2005). Promising results of classification experiments, with precision and recall for known Trouble Types exceeding 95% (Liddy et al., 2006), can, to some extent, be attributed to the fairly stable and distinct language  X  a sublanguage  X  of the trouble tickets. Initial exploration of the Trouble Tickets revealed their strong sublanguage characteristics, such as: wide use of domain-specific terminology, abbre-viations and phrases; odd grammar rules favoring shorthand; and special discourse structure reflec-tive of the communicative purpose of the tickets. The identified linguistic patterns are sufficiently consistent across the data, so that they can be de-scribed algorithmically to support effective auto-mated identification of ticket sections and semantic components. 
Experimentation with classification algorithms shows that applying the sublanguage theoretical framework to the task of mining trouble ticket data appears to be a promising approach to the problem of reducing human error and, thus, expanding the scope of data amenable to data mining techniques that use Trouble Type information. 
Our directions for future research include ex-perimenting with other machine learning tech-niques, utilizing the newly-gained knowledge of the tickets X  sublanguage grammar, as well as test-ing sublanguage analysis technology on other types of field service reports.
