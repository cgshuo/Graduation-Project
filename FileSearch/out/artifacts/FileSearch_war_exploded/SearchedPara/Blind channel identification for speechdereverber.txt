 Speech dereverberation, which may be viewed as a denoising t echnique, is crucial for many speech related applications, such as hands-free teleconferencin g and automatic speech recognition. It is a challenging signal processing task and remains an open prob lem after more than three decades of research. Although many approaches [1] have been developed for speech dereverberation, blind channel identification (BCI) is believed to be the key to thor oughly solving the dereverberation problem. Most BCI approaches rely on source statistics (hig her order statistics [2] or statistics of LPC coefficients [3]), or spatial difference among multip le channels [4] for resolving solution degeneracies due to the lack of knowledge of the source. The p erformance of these approaches depends on how well they model real acoustic systems (mainly sources and channels). The BCI approaches using source statistics need a long sequence of d ata to build up the statistics, and their performance often degrades significantly in real acoustic e nvironments where acoustic systems are time-varying and only approximately time-invariant durin g a short time window. Besides the data efficiency issue, there are some other difficulties in the BCI approaches using source statistics, for example, non-stationarity of a speech source, whitening si de effect, and non-minimum phase of a filter [2]. In contrast, the BCI approaches exploiting chan nel spatial difference are blind to the source, and thus they avoid those difficulties arising in ass uming source statistics. Unfortunately, these approaches are often too ill-conditioned to tolerate even a very small amount of ambient noise. In general, BCI for speech dereverberation is an active rese arch area, and the main challenge is how to build an effective acoustic model that not only can resolv e solution degeneracies due to the lack of knowledge of the source, but also robustly models real aco ustic environments. To address the challenge, this paper proposes a sparse acoustic room impulse response (RIR) model for BCI, that is, an acoustic RIR can be modeled by a sparse FIR filter. The sparse RIR model is theoretically sound [5], and it has been shown to be useful fo r estimating RIRs in real acoustic envi-ronments when the source is given a priori [6]. In this paper, the sparse RIR model is incorporated with channel spatial difference, resulting a blind sparse channel identification (BSCI) approach for a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) acoustic system. Th e BSCI approach aims to resolve some of the difficulties in conventional BCI approaches. It is bli nd to the source and therefore avoids the difficulties arising in assuming source statistics. Meanwh ile, the BSCI approach is expected to be robust to ambient noise. It has been shown that, when the sour ce is given a priori [7], the prior knowledge about sparse RIRs plays an important role in robus tly estimating RIRs in noisy acoustic environments. Furthermore, the statistics describing the sparseness of RIRs are governed by acous-tic room characteristics, and thus they are close to be stati onary with respect to a specific room. This is advantageous in terms of both learning the statistics and applying them in channel identification. Based on the cross relation formulation [4] of BCI, this pape r develops a BSCI algorithm that incor-porates the sparse RIR model. Our choice for enforcing spars ity is l 1 -norm regularization [8], which has been the driving force for many emerging fields in signal p rocessing, such as sparse coding and compressive sensing. In the context of BCI, two important is sues need to be addressed when using l -norm regularization. First, the existing cross relation f ormulation for BCI is nonconvex, and di-rectly enforcing l 1 -norm regularization will result in an intractable optimiz ation. Second, l 1 -norm regularization parameters are critical for deriving corre ct solutions, and their improper setting may lead to totally irrelevant solutions. To address these two i ssues, this paper shows how to formulate the BCI of a SIMO system into a convex optimization, indeed an unconstrained least squares (LS) problem, which provides a flexible platform for incorporati ng l 1 -norm regularization; it also shows how to infer the optimal l 1 -norm regularization parameters directly from microphone observations under a Bayesian framework.
 We evaluate the proposed BSCI approach using both simulatio ns and experiments in real acoustic environments. Simulation results illustrate the effectiv eness of the proposed sparse RIR model in resolving solution degeneracies, and they show that the BSC I approach is able to robustly and accu-rately identify filters from noisy microphone observations . When applied to speech dereverberation in real acoustic environments, the BSCI approach yields sou rce estimates with high fidelity to ane-choic chamber measurements. All of these demonstrate that t he BSCI approach has the potential for solving the difficult speech dereverberation problem. 2.1 Previous work Our BSCI approach is based on the cross relation formulation for blind SIMO channel identifica-tion [4]. In a one-speaker two-microphone system, the micro phone signals at time k can be written as: where  X  denotes linear convolution, s ( k ) is a source signal, h i represents the channel impulse re-sponse between the source and the i th microphone, and n i ( k ) is ambient noise. The cross relation crophone signals are noiseless [4]. Then, without requirin g any knowledge from the source signal, the channel filters can be identified by minimizing the square d cross relation error. In matrix-vector form, the optimization can be written as where X i is the ( N + L  X  1)  X  L convolution Toeplitz matrix whose first row and first column a re [ x that the above optimization is a minimum eigenvalue problem , and it can be solved by eigenvalue decomposition. As shown in [4], the eigenvalue decompositi on approach finds the true solution within a constant time delay and a constant scalar factor whe n 1) the system is noiseless; 2) the two filters are co-prime (namely, no common zeros); and 3) the sys tem is sufficiently excited (i.e., the source needs to have enough frequency bands).
 Unfortunately, the eigenvalue decomposition approach has not been demonstrated to be useful for speech dereverberation in real acoustic environments. Thi s is because the conditions for finding true solutions are difficult to sustain. First, microphone s ignals in real acoustic environments are always immersed in excessive ambient noise (such as air-con ditioning noise), and thus the noiseless assumption is never true. Second, it requires precise infor mation about filter order for the filters to be co-prime, however, the filter order itself is hard to compu te accurately since the filters modeling RIRs are often thousands of taps long. As a result, eigenvalu e decomposition approach is often ill-conditioned and very sensitive to even a very small amou nt of ambient noise.
 Our proposed sparse RIR model aims to alleviate those difficu lties. Under the sparse RIR model, sparsity regularization automatically determines filter o rder since surplus filter coefficients are forced to be zero. Furthermore, previous work [7] has demons trated that, when the source is given a priori , sparsity regularization plays an important role in robust ly estimating RIRs in noisy acoustic environments. In order to exploit the sparse RIR model, we fir st formulate the BCI using cross rela-tion into a convex optimization, which will provide a flexible platform for enf orcing l 1 -norm sparsity regularization. 2.2 Convex formulation The optimization in Eq. 2 is nonconvex because its domain, k h 1 k 2 + k h 2 k 2 = 1 , is nonconvex. We propose to replace it with a convex singleton linear constraint, and the optimization becomes where h 1 ( l ) is the l th element of filter h 1 . It is easy to see that, when microphone signals are noiseless, the optimizations in Eqs. 2 and 3 yield equivalen t solutions within a constant time delay and a constant scalar factor. Because the optimization is a m inimization, h 1 ( l ) tends to align with Consequently, the singleton linear constraint removes two degrees of freedom in filter estimates: a ( 0  X  l  X  L  X  1 ) is arbitrary as long as the direct path in filter h 2 is no more than l samples earlier than the one in filter h 1 .
 The new formulation in Eq. 3 has many advantages. It is convex and indeed an unconstrained LS problem since the singleton linear constraint can be easily substituted into the objective function. Furthermore, the new LS formulation is more robust to ambien t noise than the eigenvalue decompo-sition approach in Eq. 2. This can be better viewed in the freq uency domain. Because the squared cross relation error (the objective function in Eqs. 2 and 3) is weighted in the frequency domain by the power spectrum density of a common source, the total filte r energy constraint in Eq. 2 may be filled with less significant frequency bands which contribut e little to the source and are weighted less in the objective function. As a result, the eigenvalue d ecomposition approach is very sensitive to noise. In contrast, the singleton linear constraint in Eq . 3 has much less coupling in filter energy allocation, and the new LS approach is more robust to ambient noise.
 Then, the BSCI approach is to incorporate the LS formulation with l 1 -norm sparsity regularization, and the optimization becomes where  X   X  is a nonnegative scalar regularization parameter that bala nces the preference between the squared cross relation error and the sparseness of solution s described by their l 1 -norm. The setting of  X   X  is critical for deriving appropriate solutions, and we will show how to compute its optimal setting in a Bayesian framework in Section 2.3. Given a  X   X  , the optimization in Eq. 4 is convex and can be solved by various methods with guaranteed global c onvergence. We implemented the Mehrotra predictor-corrector primal-dual interior point method [9], which is known to yield better search directions than the Newton X  X  method. Our implementa tion usually solves the optimization in Eq. 4 with extreme accuracy (relative duality gap less than 10  X  14 ) in less than 20 iterations. 2.3 Bayesian l 1 -norm sparse learning for blind channel identification The l 1 -norm regularization parameter  X   X  in Eq. 4 is critical for deriving appropriately sparse solu-tions. How to determine its optimal setting is still an open r esearch topic. A recent development is to solve the optimization in Eq. 4 with respect to all possible v alues of  X   X  [10], and cross-validation is then employed to find an appropriate solution. However, it is not easy to obtain extra data for cross-validation in BCI since real acoustic environments are ofte n time-varying. In this study, we develop a Bayesian framework for inferring the optimal regularization parameters for the BSCI formulation in Eq. 4. A similar Bayesian framework can be found in [7], whe re the source was assumed to be known a priori .
 The optimization in Eq. 4 is a maximum-a-posteriori estimation under the following probabilistic assumptions where the cross relation error is an I.I.D. zero-mean Gaussi an with variance  X  2 , and the filter coeffi-cients are governed by a Laplacian sparse prior with the scal ar parameter  X  . Then, the regularization parameter  X   X  in Eq. 4 can be written as When the ambient noise [ n 1 ( k ) and n 2 ( k ) in Eq. 1] is an I.I.D. zero-mean Gaussian with variance  X  , the parameter  X  2 can be approximately written as approximation because the cross relation error is temporal ly correlated through the convolution. Nevertheless, since the cross relation error is the result o f the convolutive mixing, its distribution will be close to the Gaussian with its variance described by E q. 8 according to the central limit theorem. We choose to estimate the ambient noise level (  X  2 0 ) directly from microphone observations via restricted maximum likelihood [11]: where the denominator N  X  L  X  1 (but not 2 N ) accounts for the loss of the degrees of freedom during the optimization. The above minimization is solved b y coordinate descent alternatively with respect to the source and the filters. It is initialized with t he LS solution by Eq. 3 and often able to yield a good  X  2 0 estimate in a few iterations. Note that each iteration can be computed efficiently in the frequency domain. Meanwhile, the parameter  X  can be computed by as a result of finding the optimal Laplacian distribution giv en its sufficient statistics. With the Eqs. 8 and 10, finding the optimal regularization par ameters becomes computing the statis-to acoustic room characteristics and may be computed from th em if they are known a priori . For example, the reverberation time of a room defines how fast ech oes decay  X  60 dB, and it can be used to compute the filter statistics. More generally, we cho ose to compute the statistics directly from microphone observations in the Baysian framework by ma ximizing the marginal likelihood , P ( X 2 h 1  X  X 1 h 2 |  X  2 ,  X  ) = R h through Expectation-Maximization (EM) updates [7]: where h 1 and h 2 are treated as hidden variables,  X  2 and  X  are parameters, and Q ( h 1 , h 2 )  X  and h 2 given the current estimate of  X  2 and  X  . The integrals in Eqs. 11 and 12 can be computed using the variational scheme described in [7]. The EM update s often converge to a good estimate of  X  2 and  X  in a few iterations. Moreover, since the filter statistics ar e relatively stationary for a speci-fied room, the Bayesian inference may be carried out off-line and only once if the room conditions stay the same.
 After the filters are identified by BCI approaches, the source can be computed by various meth-ods [12]. We choose to estimate the source by the following op timization which will yield maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation if the filter estimates are accurate. 3.1 Simulations 3.1.1 Simulations with artificial RIRs We first employ a simulated example to illustrate the effecti veness of the proposed sparse RIR model for BCI. In the simulation, we used a speech sequence of 1024 s amples (with 16 kHz sampling rate) as the source ( s ) and simulated two 16-sample FIR filters ( h 1 and h 2 ). The filter h 1 had nonzero nonzero elements only at indices 2, 6, 8, and 10 with amplitud es of 1, -0.6, 0.6, and 0.4, respectively. Notice that both h 1 and h 2 are sparse. Then the simulated microphone observations ( x 1 and x 2 ) were computed by Eq. 1 with the ambient noise being real noise recorded in a classroom. The noise was scaled so that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the mic rophone signals was approximately 20 dB. Because a big portion of the noise (mainly air-condition ing noise) was at low frequency, the microphone observations were high-passed with a cut-off fr equency of 100 Hz before they were fed to BCI algorithms. In the BSCI algorithm, the l 1 -norm regularization parameters,  X  2 and  X  , were estimated in the Bayesian framework using the update rules g iven in Eqs. 11 and 12.
 Figure 1 shows the filters identified by different BCI approac hes. Compared to the conventional eigenvalue decomposition method (Eq. 2), the new convex LS a pproach (Eq. 3) is more robust to ambient noise and yielded better filter estimates even thoug h the estimates still seem to be convolved by a common filter. The proposed BSCI approach (Eq. 4) yielded filter estimates that are almost identical to the true ones. It is evident that the proposed sp arse RIR model played a crucial role in robustly and accurately identifying filters in blind manner s. The robustness and accuracy gained by the BSCI approach will become essential when the filters are t housands of taps long in real acoustic environments. 3.1.2 Simulations with measured RIRs Here we employ simulations using RIRs measured in real rooms to demonstrate the effective-ness of the proposed BSCI approach for speech dereverberati on. Its performance is compared to the beamforming, the eigenvalue decomposition (Eq. 2), a nd the LS (Eq. 3) approaches. In the simulation, the source sequence ( s ) was a sentence of speech (approximately 1.5 sec-onds), and the filters ( h 1 and h 2 ) were two measured RIRs from York MARDY database (http://www.commsp.ee.ic.ac.uk/ sap/mardy.htm) but dow n-sampled to 16 kHz (from originally 48 kHz). The original filters in the database were not sparse, bu t they had many tiny coefficients which were in the range of measurement uncertainty. To make the sim ulated filters sparse, we simply zeroed out those coefficients whose amplitudes were less tha n 2% of the maximum. Finally, we truncated the filters to have length of 2048 since there were v ery few nonzero coefficients after that. With the simulated source and filters, we then computed micro phone observations using Eq. 1 with ambient noise being real noise recorded in a classroom. For t esting the robustness of different BCI algorithms, the ambient noise was scaled to different level s so that the SNRs varied from 60 dB to 10 dB. Similar to the previous simulations, the simulated obse rvations were high-passed with a cutoff Figure 2: The simulation results using measured real RIRs. The normal ized correlation (defined in Eq. 14) frequency of 100 Hz before they were fed to different BCI algorithms. In the BS CI approach, the l -norm regularization parameters were iteratively compute d using the updates in Eqs. 11 and 12. After filters were identified, the source was estimated using Eq. 13.
 Because both filter and source estimates by BCI algorithms ar e within a constant time delay and a constant scalar factor, we use normalized correlation for evaluating the estimates. Let  X s and s 0 is defined as where m and k are sample indices, and kk denotes l 2 -norm. It is easy to see that, the normalized correlation is between 0% and 100% : it is equal to 0% when the two signals are uncorrelated, and it is equal to 100% only when the two signal are identical within a constant time delay and a constant scalar factor. The definition in Eq. 14 is also applicable to t he evaluation of filter estimates. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 2. Similar to what we observed in the previous example, the convex LS approach (Eq. 3) shows significant improvement in both filter and source estimation compared to the eigenvalue decomposition approach (Eq. 2). In fact, the eigenvalue decomposition approach did not yield relevant results because it was too il l-conditioned due to the long filters. The remarkable performance came from the BSCI approach, whi ch incorporates the convex LS formulation with the sparse RIR model. In particular, the BS CI approach yielded higher than 90% normalized correlation in source estimates when SNR was bet ter than 20 dB, and it yielded higher than 99% normalized correlation in the low noise limit. The performa nce of the canonical delay-and-sum beamforming is also presented as the baseline for al l BCI algorithms. 3.2 Experiments We also evaluated the proposed BSCI approach using signals r ecorded in real acoustic environ-ments. We carried out 10 experiments in total in a reverberan t room. In each experiment, a sentence of speech (approximately 1.5 seconds, and the same for all ex periments) was played through a loud-speaker (NSW2-326-8A, Aura Sound) and recorded by a matched omnidirectional microphone pair (M30MP, Earthworks). The speaker-microphone positions (a nd thus RIRs) were different in dif-ferent experiments. Because the recordings had a large amou nt of low-frequency noise, they were high-passed with a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz before they wer e fed to BCI algorithms. In the BSCI approach, the l 1 -norm regularization parameters,  X  2 and  X  , were iteratively computed using the updates in Eq. 11 and 12. After the filters were identified, the sources were computed using Eq. 13. We also had recordings in the anechoic chamber at Bell Labs using the same instruments and settings, and the anechoic measurement served as the app roximated ground truth for evaluating the performance of different BCI approaches. Figure 3 shows the source estimates in the 10 experiments in t erms of their normalized correlation to the anechoic measurement. The performance of the propose d BSCI is compared with the beam-forming, the eigenvalue decomposition (Eq. 2), and the conv ex LS (Eq. 3) approaches. The results of the 10 experiments unanimously support our previous finding s in simulations. First, the convex LS approach yielded significantly better source estimates tha n the eigenvalue decomposition method. Second, the proposed BSCI approach, which incorporates the convex LS formulation with the sparse RIR model, yielded the most dramatic results, achieving 85% or higher of normalized correlation in source estimates in most experiments while the LS approach o nly obtained approximately 70% of normalized correlation.
 Figure 4 shows one instance of filter and source estimates. Th e estimated filters have about 2000 zeros out of totally 3072 coefficients, and thus they are spar se. This observation experimentally validates our hypothesis of the sparse RIR models, namely, a n acoustic RIR can be modeled by a sparse FIR filter. The source estimate shown in Fig. 4 vividly illustrates the convolution and dere-verberation process. It only plots a small segment to reveal greater details. As we see, the anechoic measurement was clean and had clear harmonic structure; the signal recorded in the reverberant room was smeared by echoes during the convolution process; a nd then, the dereverberation using our BSCI approach deblurred the signal and recovered the und erlying harmonic structure. We propose a blind sparse channel identification (BSCI) approach for speech dereverberation. It consists of three important components. The first is the sparse RIR model , which effectively resolves solution degeneracies and robustly models real acoustic en vironments. The second is the convex formulation , which guarantees global convergence of the proposed BSCI a lgorithm. And the third is the Bayesian l 1 -norm sparse learning scheme that infers the optimal regularization parameters for deriving optimally sparse solutions. The results demon strate that the proposed BSCI approach holds the potential to solve the speech dereverberation pro blem in real acoustic environments, which has been recognized as a very difficult problem in signal proc essing. The acoustic data used in this paper are available at http://www.seas.upenn.edu/  X  linyuanq/Research.html.
 Our future work includes side-by-side comparison between o ur BSCI approach and existing source statistics based BCI approaches. Our goal is to build a unifo rm framework that combines various prior knowledge about acoustic systems for best solving the speech dereverberation problem.
