 Case marks of a sentence are represented by postpo-sitional particles in Japanese. Incorrect usage of the particles causes serious communication errors be-cause the cases become unclear. For example, in the following sentence, it is unclear what must be deleted.
If the accusative particle o is replaced by a nomi-native one ga , it becomes clear that the writer wants to delete the e-mail ( X  X hen the e-mail has arrived, please delete it. X ). Such particle errors frequently occur in sentences written by non-native Japanese speakers.

This paper presents a method that can automat-ically correct Japanese particle errors. This task corresponds to preposition/article error correction in English. For English error correction, many stud-ies employ classifiers, which select the appropriate prepositions/articles, by restricting the error types to articles and frequent prepositions (Gamon, 2010; Han et al., 2010; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2011).
On the contrary, Mizumoto et al. (2011) proposed translator-based error correction. This approach can handle all error types by converting the learner X  X  sentences into the correct ones. Although the target of this paper is particle error, we employ a similar approach based on sequence conversion (Imamura et al., 2011) since this offers excellent scalability.
The conversion approach requires pairs of the learner X  X  and the correct sentences. However, col-lecting a sufficient number of pairs is expensive. To avoid this problem, we use additional corpus con-sisting of pseudo-error sentences automatically gen-erated from correct sentences that mimic the real-errors (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b). Furthermore, we apply a domain adaptation technique that re-gards the pseudo-errors and the real-errors as the source and the target domain, respectively, so that the pseudo-errors better match the real-errors. We start by describing discriminative sequence con-version. Our error correction method converts the learner X  X  word sequences into the correct sequences. Our method is similar to phrase-based statistical ma-chine translation (PBSMT), but there are three dif-ferences; 1) it adopts the conditional random fields, 2) it allows insertion and deletion, and 3) binary and real features are combined. Unlike the classification approach, the conversion approach can correct mul-tiple errors of all types in a sentence. 2.1 Basic Procedure We apply the morpheme conversion approach that converts the results of a speech recognizer into word sequences for language analyzer processing (Ima-mura et al., 2011). It corrects particle errors in the input sentences as follows.  X 
First, all modification candidates are obtained by referring to a phrase table. This table, called the confusion set (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010a) in the error correction task, stores pairs of incorrect and correct particles (Table 1). The candidates are packed into a lattice structure, called the phrase lattice (Figure 1). To deal with unchanged words, it also copies the input words and inserts them into the phrase lattice.  X 
Next, the best phrase sequence in the phrase lat-tice is identified based on the conditional random fields (CRFs (Lafferty et al., 2001)). The Viterbi algorithm is applied to the decoding because error correction does not change the word order.  X 
While training, word alignment is carried out by dynamic programming matching. From the align-ment results, the phrase table is constructed by ac-quiring particle errors, and the CRF models are trained using the alignment results as supervised data. 2.2 Insertion / Deletion Since an insertion can be regarded as replacing an empty word with an actual word, and deletion is the replacement of an actual word with an empty one, we treat these operations as substitution without dis-tinction while learning/applying the CRF models.
However, insertion is a high cost operation be-cause it may occur at any location and can cause lattice size to explode. To avoid this problem, we permit insertion only immediately after nouns. 2.3 Features In this paper, we use mapping features and link fea-tures. The former measure the correspondence be-tween input and output words (similar to the trans-lation models of PBSMT). The latter measure the fluency of the output word sequence (similar to lan-guage models).

The mapping features are all binary. The focusing phrase and its two surrounding words of the input are regarded as the window. The mapping features are defined as the pairs of the output phrase and 1-, 2-, and 3-grams in the window.

The link features are important for the error cor-rection task because the system has to judge output correctness. Fortunately, CRF, which is a kind of discriminative model, can handle features that de-pend on each other; we mix two types of features as follows and optimize their weights in the CRF framework.  X 
N -gram features: N -grams of the output words, from 1 to 3, are used as binary features. These are obtained from a training corpus (paired sen-tences). Since the feature weights are optimized considering the entire feature space, fine-tuning can be achieved. The accuracy becomes almost perfect on the training corpus.  X 
Language model probability: This is a logarith-mic value (real value) of the n -gram probability of the output word sequence. One feature weight is assigned. The n -gram language model can be constructed from a large sentence set because it does not need the learner X  X  sentences.

Incorporating binary and real features yields a rough approximation of generative models in semi-supervised CRFs (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008). It can appropriately correct new sentences while maintain-ing high accuracy on the training corpus. The error corrector described in Section 2 requires paired sentences. However, it is expensive to col-lect them. We resolve this problem by using pseudo-error sentences and domain adaptation. 3.1 Pseudo-Error Generation Correct sentences, which are halves of the paired sentences, can be easily acquired from corpora such as newspaper articles. Pseudo-errors are generated from them by the substitution, insertion, and dele-tion functions according to the desired error pat-terns.

We utilize the method of Rozovskaya and Roth (2010b). Namely, when particles appear in the cor-rect sentence, they are replaced by incorrect ones in a probabilistic manner by applying the phrase table (which stores the error patterns) in the opposite di-rection. The error generation probabilities are rel-ative frequencies on the training corpus. The mod-els are learnt using both the training corpus and the pseudo-error sentences. 3.2 Adaptation by Feature Augmentation Although the error generation probabilities are com-puted from the real-error corpus, the error distribu-tion that results may be inappropriate. To better fit the pseudo-errors to the real-errors, we apply a do-main adaptation technique. Namely, we regard the pseudo-error corpus as the source domain and the real-error corpus as the target domain, and models are learnt that fit the target domain.

In this paper, we use Daume (2007) X  X  feature aug-mentation method for the domain adaptation, which eliminates the need to change the learning algo-rithm. This method regards the models for the source domain as the prior distribution and learns the models for the target domain.

We briefly review feature augmentation. The fea-ture space is segmented into three parts: common, source, and target. The features extracted from the source domain data are deployed to the common and the source spaces, and those from the target do-main data are deployed to the common and the target spaces. Namely, the feature space is tripled (Figure 2).

The parameter estimation is carried out in the usual way on the above feature space. Consequently, the weights of the common features are emphasized if the features are consistent between the source and the target. With regard to domain dependent fea-tures, the weights in the source or the target space are emphasized.

Error correction uses only the features in the com-mon and target spaces. The error distribution ap-proaches that of the real-errors because the weights of features are optimized to the target domain. In ad-dition, it becomes robust against new sentences be-cause the common features acquired from the source domain can be used even when they do not appear in the target domain. 4.1 Experimental Settings Real-error Corpus: We collected learner X  X  sen-tences written by Chinese native speakers. The sen-tences were created from English Linux manuals and figures, and Japanese native speakers revised them. From these sentences, only particle errors were retained; the other errors were corrected. As a result, we obtained 2,770 paired sentences. The number of incorrect particles was 1,087 (8.0%) of 13,534. Note that most particles did not need to be revised. The number of pair types of incorrect parti-cles and their correct ones was 132.
 Language Model: It was constructed from Japanese Wikipedia articles about computers and Japanese Linux manuals, 527,151 sentences in total. SRILM (Stolcke et al., 2011) was used to train a trigram model.
 Pseudo-error Corpus: The pseudo-errors were generated using 10,000 sentences randomly selected from the corpus for the language model. The mag-nification of the error generation probabilities was changed from 0.0 (i.e., no errors) to 2.0 (the relative frequency in the real-error corpus was taken as 1.0). Evaluation Metrics: Five-fold cross-validation on the real-error corpus was used. We used two met-rics: 1) Precision and recall rates of the error correc-tion by the systems, and 2) Relative improvement, the number of differences between improved and de-graded particles in the output sentences (no changes were ignored). This is a practical metric because it denotes the number of particles that human rewriters do not need to revise after the system correction. 4.2 Results Figure 3 plots the precision/recall curves for the fol-lowing four combinations of training corpora and method.  X 
TRG: The models were trained using only the real-error corpus (baseline).  X 
SRC: Trained using only the pseudo-error corpus.  X 
ALL: Trained using the real-error and pseudo-error corpora by simply adding them.  X  AUG:
The proposed method. The feature augmentation was realized by regarding the pseudo-errors as the source domain and the real-errors as the target do-main.

The SRC case, which uses only the pseudo-error sentences, did not match the precision of TRG. The ALL case matched the precision of TRG at high recall rates. AUG, the proposed method, achieved higher precision than TRG at high recall rates. At the recall rate of 18%, the precision rate of AUG was 55.4%; in contrast, that of TRG was 50.5%. Fea-ture augmentation effectively leverages the pseudo-errors for error correction.

Figure 4 shows the relative improvement of each method according to the error generation probabil-ities. In this experiment, ALL achieved higher im-provement than TRG at error generation probabili-ties ranging from 0.0 to 0.6. Although the improve-ments were high, we have to control the error gen-eration probability because the improvements in the SRC case fell as the magnification was raised. On the other hand, AUG achieved stable improvement regardless of the error generation probability. We can conclude that domain adaptation to the pseudo-error sentences is the preferred approach. This paper presented an error correction method of Japanese particles that uses pseudo-error generation. We applied domain adaptation in which the pseudo-errors are regarded as the source domain and the real-errors as the target domain. In our experiments, domain adaptation achieved stable improvement in system performance regardless of the error genera-tion probability.
