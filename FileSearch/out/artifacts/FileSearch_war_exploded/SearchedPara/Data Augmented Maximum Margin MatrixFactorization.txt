 With the dramatic development of Web 2.0 and social network technologies, social media become more and more important as a way for users to obtain valuable information, express individual opinions, share experiences as well as keep in touch with friends. Online photo sharing sites, such as Flickr 1 and Picasa Web Album 2 , become popular with numerous images uploaded every day (over 6 billion images in Flickr ) [18]. User groups on such sites are self-organized communities to share photos and conver sations with similar interest and have gained massive popularity. Joining groups facilitates flexibility in indexing and managing self photos, making them more accessible to the public and searching photos and users with similar interests. As the support of above view, Negoescu et al. provide an in-depth analysis of the structure of Flickr groups and the motivation of group activities [10][11].

Although the information contributed by user groups could greatly improve the user X  X  browsing experience and enrich the social connections, the real situa-tion is that many users rarely join in any group. By studying 3 million images and the respective users and groups crawled from Flickr , we discover an inter-esting fact that only 6 . 7% users have ever joined one image group and only 1 . 9% users have joined more than 5 groups. Thus, it is necessary to design a recom-mendation approach that could automatically recommend appropriate groups for users.

Group recommendation for photo sharing s ites is a relatively novel scenario that have not been systematically studied. Current works commonly employs tra-ditional recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering [9] and matrix factorization [7,15] to recommend groups in a collaborative way. However, the recommendation performances of current work are not satisfied enough, due to two following points which are not yet considered carefully:  X  Sparse User-Group Matrix. As discussed above, many users rarely join  X  Cold Start Problem. It should be noted that the cold-start problem in
As an early explorer in group recommendation for online photo sharing sites, we propose a hybrid recommendation approach named Data Augmented Maxi-mum Margin Matrix Factorization (DAM 3 F) to handle the above two problems, by integrating collaborative user-group relationship and user similarity graph. On one hand, Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization (MMMF) [17] is adopted for collaborative recommendation, by jointly learning the latent factors of users and groups from the original user-group relationship. As an improvement of tra-dition matrix factorization approaches, Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization uses hinge loss instead of sum-square loss and has been proven to be an effec-tive approach for collaborative recommendation on sparse dataset. On the other hand, the user similarity graph obtained from the user uploaded images and an-notated tags is used as an complementary part to handle the cold start problem and to improve the performance of MMMF. Specifically, graph regularization is introduced to preserve the u ser similarity, which provides a more interpretable way to characterize the users and groups. Further, a novel objective function is proposed which jointly consider the abo ve issues, and an efficient optimization algorithm is provided to solve the objective function.

In particular, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: 1. This paper proposes a hybrid approach named DAM 3 F to handle the sparse 2.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a survey of related work in group recommendation. Section 3 shows the details of the pro-posed approach for Flickr group recommendation, while Section 4 reports the performance of DAM 3 F based on real-world dataset. Finally Section 5 concludes this paper. User groups on social Websites, are self -organized communi ties to share pho-tos and conversations with similar interest and have gained massive popularity. Group recommendation is an important paradigm that discovering the inter-esting groups for users, a nd attracts a lot of attent ion in recent years. In this section, we briefly introduce the related work in this area, by classifying them into three categories according to the employed approaches.  X  Content-based recommendation : This category of m ethods recommends  X  Collaborative filtering based recommendation : This category of meth- X  Hybrid recommendation : This category of methods combines several al-
The proposed approach DAM 3 F in the paper is a hybrid one, in which we take the advantage of the above related works (e.g., user-annotated tags are utilized), and introduce some novel data (i.e., visual features extracted from the uploaded images) to further improve the performance of recommendation. In the technology aspect, we extend the traditional MMMF, and propose a novel objective function in which both user-group relationship and user similarity graph are considered. Further, an efficient optimization approach is proposed to solve the objective function. In this section, we show the details of Data Augmented Maximum Margin Ma-trix Factorization (DAM 3 F), which is the extension of the classical Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization approach by taking the uploaded images and user-annotated tags into consideration. To begin with, we give the main framework of DAM 3 F in Figure 1. 3.1 Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization Given the sets of M users, N images and P groups respectively, R  X  R M  X  P is the affiliation matrix between users and groups, where R ij = 1 means that the i th user is the member of the j th group and 0 otherwise. Furthermore, we use matrix S  X  R M  X  N to denote the ownership between users and images where S ik = 1 indicates that the k th image is uploaded by the i th user. By extracting the D dimension visual feature of the N images, we obtain the image feature matrix X =[ x 1 ,x 2 ,...,x N ] T  X  R N  X  D . Given the information above, the aims of group recommendation is to recover a new affiliation matrix R rec denote the relationship between users and groups, and more importantly to recommend new groups to users based on R rec .

The traditional matrix factorization approaches for recommendation tries to factorize the affiliation matrix R into two M  X  K and N  X  K dimensional low-rank matrices U and G by: where  X  F denotes the Frobenius norm and K is dimensionality of the latent factors of both users and groups. Besides, the regularization penalties  X  ( U F + G F ) is utilized to avoid over-fitting. Afterwards, the recommendation results can be obtained by calculating similarity between the latent factors of users and groups as R rec = UG T .

As for our group recommendation problem, R rec ij only has two entries, i.e. 0 and 1, which indicates whether the i th user affiliates to the j th group. Therefore, comparing with traditional recommendation techniques which obtain the rating matrix, group recommendation is more appropriate to be formulated as a binary classification problem. Besides, since there are much more 0 X  X  than 1 X  X  in matrix R , the resulting recommendation results will be heavily biased towards 0 by using traditional matrix factorization approaches.

In order to overcome such limitations, Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization (MMMF) is proposed by replacing the sum-squared loss with hinge loss which has been widely used in classification application, such as Support Vector Machines. According to [13][17], the objective function of MMMF can be written as: where h ( z )=(1  X  z ) + = max (0 , 1  X  z ) corresponds to the hinge loss.
Above formulation can be also interpreted as simultaneous learning of feature vectors and linear classifiers. By viewing matrix U as the feature vectors of the users, matrix G can be regarded as linear classifiers that map the user feature vectors into binary labels that indicate whether the user is interested in that group. In addition, hinge loss is adopted for learning maximum margin classifiers with respect to each group. 3.2 Data Augmented Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization Similar to other collaborative filtering algorithms, MMMF based recommenda-tion still suffers cold-start problem, i.e., recommendation results for new users who have not joined groups tend to be very inaccurate. This problem could be solved, to some extent, by exploiting cont ent information of the users, i.e., the features extracted from their uploaded images and the corresponding annotated tags. The basic assumption is: if two users have joined in the same group, then their uploaded images to this group will probably be visually similar or semanti-cally (tag-based) similar. Based on this assumption, we can incorporate such user similarity graph into the MMMF based recommendation framework. Firstly, the feature vector f i w.r.t. the i th user can be calculated by averaging the feature vectors of all his images or tags as: where S ij denotes the j th image uploaded by u i , X j means the visual or semantic (tag-based) feature of S ij . It should be noted that the process of feature extrac-tion is introduced in Section 4.1. The n we can construct the adjacency matrix W of the user similarity graph as follows: where N ( x i ) denotes the k -nearest neighbor of x i and the Heat Kernel is ex-ploited to measure the similarity of two feature vectors. To guarantee that users who upload visually or semantically similar images will also obtain similar latent factors, we introduce the following graph regularization term: where tr (  X  ) denotes the matrix trace, D ii = i W ij is a diagonal matrix and L = D  X  W is the Laplacian matrix of the user similarity graph.

By leveraging the collaborating information and user similarity graph, we propose the Data Augmented Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization (DAM 3 F) framework, which unifies maximum margin matrix factorization and graph regularization as: argmin where  X  is the trade-off parameter between co llaborating information and con-tent information, L 1 is the Laplacian matrix of the image based user similarity graph (visually), L 2 is the Laplacian matrix of the tag based user similarity graph (semantically), and  X  is the trade-off parameter between visual information and tag information.

Although the proposed objective function is not a convex function of U and G , but it is convex to one variable when the other one is fixed. Therefore, we could obtain the local optimal solution by alternatively updating the two variables using gradient descent methods.
 Denoting the objective function as J ( U,G ), we can calculate the gradient of J ( U,G ). The partial derivative with respect to U is: The partial derivative with respect to G is:
Since the hinge loss function h ( z ) is non-smooth at z = 1, following [13], we adopt smooth hinge instead of hinge loss for the ease of optimization. The further details of optimization process is omitted due to the space limitation. In this section, we evaluate the perfo rmance of the proposed approach on the real-world dataset crawled from Flickr by using kinds of metrics, and compare it with state-of-the-art approaches. Sepcifically, all experiments are conducted on a windows workstation with Intel 2.67GHz Xeon CPU and 32GB RAM by using Matlab 8.0. 4.1 Experiment Setup To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we collect an image dataset from Flickr by using its API 3 . The details of this dataset could be found in Table 1. To obtain this dataset, we first select popular groups in Flickr by keyword searching. Then, active users of these groups and their uploaded images as well as the annotated tags are crawled , respectively. As for the process of feature extraction, we extract 81-dimensional color histogram/moments feature and 37-dimensional edge histogram feature to generate the visual feature to represent these images by using FELib 4 , and employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to generate 50-dimensional semantic feature to represent the annotated tags of the uploaded images. Due to the space limitation, we don X  X  give the details of the tag-based feature extraction.

To evaluate the performance of group recommendation, we randomly sample  X  100% of the user-group assignments from the user-group affiliation matrix to generate the matrix R for training and use the full user-group affiliation matrix as the ground-truth for evaluation.
 Evaluation Metrics. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the pro-posed approach, we consider the following evaluation metrics: Precision@ k (P@ k ), Mean Average Precision (MAP), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) [2], Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and F 1 score. In particular, k is chosen to 5 and 10 for P@ k metric. 4.2 Recommendation Performance Comparison In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we imple-ment the following approaches and compare the performances: 1. CB: Content based recommendation by using the user similarity graph. 2. CF: Collaborative Filtering recommendation by using user-group 3. SVD: Singular Value Decomposition based recommendation by using user-4. NMF: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization based recommendation by using 5. MMMF: Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization based recommendation 6. DAM 3 F tag : One version of the proposed DAM 3 F in this paper, while only 7. DAM 3 F visual : One version of the proposed DAM 3 F in this paper, while In this experiment, parameter  X  is set empirically to 1 and  X  is set to 0 . 1. The dimensionality of latent factors K is set to 200. It should be noted that the parameters of all the competitive methods have been fairly tuned using cross-validate, and the average evaluation results after 10-fold cross-validation are selected.

Table 2 shows the performance comparison of above group recommendation approaches when = 60% in terms of multiple evaluation metrics. From Table 2, it can be observed that the two versions of DAM 3 F largely outperform the other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of multiple metrics. The superior per-formance of the proposed approach comes from two aspects, one is the selection of hinge loss for matrix factorization, while the other one is the integration of user similarity graph. Further, it can be discovered that the DAM 3 F visual out-performs DAM 3 F tag . The reason is two-fold: 1) extracted visual feature is more explicit than the semantic (tag-based) feature; 2) User-annotated tags are in-herent uncontrolled, ambiguous, and overly personalized. Thus, a pre-processing should be implemented before adopting user-annotated tags. In the following experiments, we implement a tag reco mmendation process to smooth the dis-tribution of tagging data, and the performance comparison could be found in Section 4.4.
Figure 2 shows the group recommendation performance comparison of differ-ent approaches while the proportion of training data varies from 20% to 80% in terms of MAP. The superior performance at different further verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In addition, it can be observed that the two versions of DAM 3 F are of greater advantage than other approaches when gets smaller. The reason is that the user similarity regularization plays a more important role when the initial affiliation matrix is sparse, which is consistent with our motivation. 4.3 Performance Evaluation of DAM 3 F In the proposed DAM 3 F, we utilize both visual feature extracted from uploaded images and semantic feature extracted from annotated tags. In the above experi-ment, we implement two versions of DAM 3 F, in each only one feature is utilized. In this section, we evaluate the performance of DAM 3 F by utilizing these two features, and evaluate the impact of trade-off parameter  X  to performance of DAM 3 F in terms of multiple metrics.

Figure 3 shows the performance of DAM 3 Fandtheimpactof  X  to it. The ap-proach is DAM 3 F tag when  X  =0, while the approach is DAM 3 F visual when  X  =1. From Fig. 3, it could be observed that DAM 3 F outperforms both DAM 3 F tag and DAM 3 F visual in terms of all metrics. It can be easily explained that the increase of relevant feature improves the performance of recommendation. Further, it could be found that the optimal value of  X  is different for different metric. Thus, the selection strategy of the optimal value of  X  should be adjusted according to the application scenario. 4.4 Impact of Tag Recommendation to DAM 3 F As discussed above, user-annotated tags are inherent uncontrolled, ambiguous, and overly personalized. Thus, a pre-pro cessing should be implemented before adopting user-annotated tags. In this section, we implement two commonly ac-cepted tag recommendation approach, i.e., Sum and Vote [16], to recommend relevant tags to the images with few tags and to delete irrelevant tags for the purpose of smoothing the tagging data distribution.

Table 3 show the performance comparison of DAM 3 F with different tag rec-ommendation approaches in terms of multiple metrics. From Table 3, it can be observed that the introduction of tag recommendation process improves the performance of DAM 3 F in terms of all metrics. It can be easily understood as the irrelevant tags don X  X  contribute to the representation of the uploaded images or even have negative effect, while the addition of relevant tags improves the representation quality of the tag-based feature. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for Flickr group recommendation by leveraging traditional collaborative recommendation with user similarity reg-ularization. More specifically, the proposed Data Augmented Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization (DAM 3 F) approach integrates the maximum margin ma-trix factorization with the user similarity graph calculated from their uploaded images and the annotated tags. Experiments implemented on the real-world dataset crawled from Flickr demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed ap-proach, by comparing it with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of multiple metrics. As a general framework, DAM 3 F can be also applied to other recom-mendation tasks.

In our future work, we will try to employ more personal and contextual infor-mation of Flickr users in the framework of DAM 3 F for the purpose of improving group recommendation performance.
