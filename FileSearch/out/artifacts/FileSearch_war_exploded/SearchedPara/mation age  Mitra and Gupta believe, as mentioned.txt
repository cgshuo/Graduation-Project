 mation age. Mitra and Gupta believe, as mentioned in the preface of the book, that  X  X  X he pivotal issue in business computing lies in incorporating new learning in automated information systems; adding to what is already known and adapting auto-matically as perspectives and properties continuing change X  (p. xvii). In the current global networked economy where tech-nology has helped to reduce distances and to increase the availability of, agility and innovation are paramount for firms to achieve global excellence and customer value. Most current methods and practices in business process engineering tend to favor operational efficiency.

In addition, current computer based business information systems are not flexible enough to efficiently response to the constantly changing business environment. Mitra and Gupta X  X  book contributes to address this issue. It shows how innova-tion can be coded using normalized patterns of information. The book also shows how business processes and information systems could be tightly aligned. Moreover, the book provides insights on how these processes and systems can be designed to automatically adapt to change by re-configuring shared patterns of knowledge.

The authors present a modular approach to building business systems that parallels that of object oriented software. They describe how business knowledge can be identified, encapsulated, and shared, as well as how reusable process modules can be developed to offer the systems flexibility. The book provides practical templates required for accelerating integration, analysis, and design. Mitra and Gupta combine world class experience from industry with the best in academic experience and leading edge research.

The book provides useful insights on how to design business processes and systems that are both agile and adaptable, coordinate integration of information across supply chains and extended enterprises, reduce time-to-market, and improve computer aided systems engineering and computer aided process engineering tools. In addition, the book offers expert guid-ance on facilitating standards, prototyping for continuous improvement, designing enterprise information systems software, and achieving process maturity to rapidly absorb and utilize innovative technology for competitive advantage.

Creating Agile Business Systems with Reusable Knowledge is very technical and not an easy to read book for someone unfamiliar with recent development of technology in the business and management field. The book would be useful and very valuable to consultants, analysts, and managers in IT as well as researchers and graduate students in business, management and IT. I would recommend it especially for graduate students in the current new emerging I-schools.

With a growing myriad of formats available for storing and retrieving information, it was only a matter of time before a book like Caribbean Libraries in the 21st Century was published. This book explores, not only in breadth but in depth, a mul-titude of issues that are affecting libraries in the Caribbean region. In eight sections and 25 chapters, it speaks to not only the concerns and efforts being put forth by librarians and library personnel, but also about their experiences. This review will provide a summary of each of the book X  X  eight parts (a compilation of articles from 41 professionals) followed by an analysis of the book as a whole. It will also discuss the intended audience for Caribbean Libraries in the 21st Century and its suitability for alternative purposes.

Part I , titled  X  X  X istorical Perspective X , consists of four chapters. These chapters are similar in that they discuss the devel-opment of Caribbean libraries across different formats (public and national, school and academic, and special). Essentially, they focus on the evolution and sustainability of Caribbean libraries. Part I discusses the struggles of establishing an efficient library space and the manner in which libraries have evolved  X  from unprofessional libraries run out of homes, to the  X  X ook van X  or  X  X ookmobile X , and now to being in electronic environments. This section of the book discusses the training that was not only required, but desired by library officials, as well as the challenges that have been faced and will continue to be faced. The various issues of culture and language, technological developments, accessibility, as well as finances and politics are also discussed. The bottom-line of this section is that,  X  X  X ooperation between library organizations at home and abroad is a necessary requirement for the survival of the libraries X  (p. 40).  X  X  X ooperative ventures have benefited libraries and librar-ians over the years, and a renewed commitment in this area is even more crucial to providing timely and easy access to information for library patrons X  (p. 49).
Part II , titled  X  X  X anagement of the 21st-Century Library  X  Collections, Staff, and Services X , contains Chapters 5 X 9. These chapters discuss in detail the work it takes to manage and sustain library services. Chapter 5 discusses the steps taken to transition from the status of a college to that of a university. Chapter 6 provides tips and tricks to gaining and managing library materials. Chapter 7 notes the importance of collecting ephemera that speak to technical evolution and advance-ments, changes in language, lifestyles, choice of entertainment, and the history of Caribbean progression. Chapter 8 discusses the challenges and constraints that school libraries face in terms of facilities, resources, services, staffing, and funding. The last chapter of this section speaks to the difficulty involved in classifying and agreeing upon a uniform system for referencing library books. Ultimately, this section leaves the reader with a new found appreciation for librarians and library staff. It brings to the reader X  X  attention the amount of effort and energy that goes into creating a library that is not simply available, but is also relevant to the individuals it is supposed to serve. The success of a library requires not only significant work, but also careful attention to the patrons and their needs.

Part III , Chapters 10 X 12, as the title describes is about  X  X  X nnovative Services X . Chapter 10 provides an excellent discussion on technology X  X  ability to empower disabled individuals. It discusses the technical adaptations and steps that the Caribbean libraries underwent to make their materials accessible to the blind. Chapter 12 takes a more specific approach and discusses the question and answers service (QAS) provided by the library and its benefits and challenges. Chapter 11 is a good chapter to summarize the purpose of libraries and the issues they incur. It speaks to the need to accommodate librarians, library personnel, and patrons. In addition, it raises the importance of increasing awareness and relevance of library materials so that users X  needs will be met, which will in turn increase appreciation for the library. This idea seems to be a recurring theme throughout the book.

Part IV , Chapters 13 X 15, speaks to the  X  X  X ntegration and Impact of Information Technology on Library Services X . Chapter 13 discusses the progression of technical services in the library, while noting that individuals should take advantage of these available services. It also provides a list of things that should be consider prior to the adaptation of such technologies into a library. Chapter 14, on the other hand, discusses the importance of educating and training users in available technologies.
This point is noted through a discussion about access management policies for library Internet use. The last chapter in this section discusses the development of digital content repositories accessible via the Internet. It touches on the  X  X  X our dimen-sions in designing a digital library: community, technology, services, and content X  (p. 212). Ultimately, this section raised two very important points: (1) while it is important to met the needs of library patrons, it could be detrimental if needs are met so specifically that it limits the scope and breadth of information available through the library and (2) if Caribbean people continue to see themselves as only consumers instead of producers of information, Caribbean heritage may be forever lost.

Part V , Chapters 16 X 18, talks about  X  X  X ibrary Cooperation and Resource Sharing in the 21st Century X . Chapter 16 discusses the value of the library to the institution, while focusing on the importance of networking across branches. It details the College Libraries Information Network (COLINET) and the importance of libraries being on the same page and understanding one another. Chapter 17 is interesting as it discusses what the authors refer to as  X  X  X he Carberry
Collection diaspora X . This chapter discusses the impact of rare Caribbean collections being purchased and stored in coun-tries of power and the resulting ethical issues. It describes the Caribbean history and the history of this Carberry collection and its authors. Chapter 18 discusses a specific initiative (The Digital Library of the Caribbean  X  dLOC) that involves a collaborative institutional effort to digitize Caribbean life and make it freely accessible to many. Essentially, it is an effort to share resources on a larger scale. It appears that this chapter X  X  purpose is to provide information about dLOC, its goals and plans, as well as to plug for additional participation. An important thing to take away from this section is that  X  X  X rue collaboration demands a deep commitment to the equality of intellectual value for all involved, that power is redefined as mutual respect and ethical regard X  (p. 233).

Part VI , titled  X  X  X ducation and Training of Library Users X , contains Chapters 19 X 21. Chapter 19 discusses the concept of information literacy. It goes into the models and best practices, as well as the need for international standards and skills training. It also discusses the things that impede individuals from being information-literate. Chapter 20 talks about the need for collaboration between librarians and faculty;  X  X  X he librarian opens the door to a new piece of knowledge; the lecturer helps the student to interpret it X  (p. 271). This chapter demonstrates that collaboration (another recurring theme throughout the book) is important. Therefore, it is essential that librarians take the initiative to reach out to students and faculty to make sure collaboration occurs instead of waiting for others to make contact with them. The final chapter of this section notes the importance of the libraries physical place for students. It goes into detail about how students use the library space, the things that are lacking, as well as the barriers to the efficiency of the libraries use by students.
The final two sections of the book ( Part VII  X   X  X  X istance Education X , Part VIII  X   X  X  X aribbean Librarians X ) contain Chapters 22 X 25. Chapter 22 examines library usage between Nova Southeastern University X  X  campus students and international stu-dents. The study found that international students used library services and resources less, although the services were equally available. However, the reason for this was not uncover since the focus was simply to determine usage. Chapter 23 discussed the importance of online course design development. It goes into detail about the difficulties present in devel-oping a distance learning course and how to overcome some of these challenges that may arise. Chapter 24, focusing on peer reviewed journals, analyzes the quantity and themes of articles published by Caribbean librarians over the years, while Chapter 25 speaks to the changing expectations of a librarian as the changes of the information environment continues.
Vision is an important word and theme that arises for these sections and demonstrates the necessity of not simply  X  X oing with the flow X  of the changing information society, but knowing which path is best for each community.

In summary, Caribbean Libraries in the 21st Century is a very informative book. There are a number of special features pre-sented throughout the book that make it an excellent resource as well as an easy read. These features include bibliographies following each article, as well as illustrations such as tables, charts, graphs, and photographs. It also includes an extensive index and a list of acronyms that prove useful for the reader. The authors in each section do not only discuss the challenges related to libraries, but where relevant, they also provide recommendations and suggestions on how to improve them. I hope that this demonstrates the diverse audience the book has been written for.

Individuals interested in library and information sciences would find this book to be an excellent read. It is meant for library science students, information professionals, information scientists, bibliographers and documenters, as well as edu-cators and historians. However, it would also prove useful for any individual interested in Caribbean libraries or Caribbean history. A final takeaway from the book is that, ultimately, change is inevitable. Therefore, individuals involved in Caribbean libraries must have a strong vision in place and must be actively involved in order to overcome the challenges facing libraries in the 21st century. In doing so, the ability to nurture community members X  desire to use the library, as well as the ability to sustain library locations and atmospheres will be preserved.
