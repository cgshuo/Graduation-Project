 Among the various forms of spatio-temporal data, remote sensing images play an important role, due to the growing wide-spreading of outer space satellites. Remote sensing is defined as the science and technology by which the charac-teristics of interesting objects can be id entified, measured or analyzed without direct contact [7]. The concept is illustrated in Figure 1.

Remote sensing satellites are currently the most significant source of new data about our planet, and remote sensing image databases are the fastest growing archives of spatial information. Data mining techniques are being studied to discover knowledge from meteorological observation data in order to provide more precise weather predictions [2,8,11,10]. Image data such as satellite images and medical images often amount to several Terabytes, thus manual and detailed analysis of these data becomes impractical [9]. Therefore an automated (or semi-automated) process to exact knowledge from these data should be included in the data mining from the image database [6].
 Features of our studies applied to the images are summarized as follows: (1) The application of data mining method applied to image classification; (2) As-sociation rules generation from the classified data.

The organization of the rest paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present the related works and our contribution. The problem definition is formally given in Section 3. In Section 4, we propose an algorithm for mining association rules on the pre-processed data. We present o ur experience with the algorithm on a real-life dataset in Section 5. Finally, we discuss the related future work and conclude with summary. For similarity searching in multimedia data, there are two main families of mul-timedia indexing and retrieval systems [1]: description-based retrieval systems and content-based retrieval systems . In a content-based ret rieval system, image feature specification queries specify or sketch image features like color, texture, or shape, which are translated into a feature vector to be matched with the feature vectors of the images in the database.

Kohonen X  X  self-organizing map is a two layer network that organizes a feature map by discovering feature relations based on input patterns through iterative non-supervised learning [3]. Figure 2 presents its basic schematic structure.
The input variables {  X  i } of SOM is defined as a real vector x =[  X  1 , X  2 ,..., X  n ] T  X  n . With each element in the SOM array we associate a parametric real vector m classified into the activated (nearest) unit m c of the input layer and projected onto the competition grids. The distance on the competition grids reflects the similarity between the patterns. After the training is complete, the obtained competition grids, i.e., the feature map, represents a natural relationship between the patterns of input signals entered into the network.

Spatial associations are rules that associate one or more spatial objects with other spatial objects. There have been two approaches to the problem. In the first one, Koperski and Han [4] defined spatial association rule of the form X  X  Y ( c %), where X and Y are sets of spatial predicates or non-spatial predicates and c % is the confidence of the rule. More recently, Shekhar and Huang [5] tackled the co-location patterns problem, where the spatial information defines a new and flexible notion of transaction, able to cope with the non-transitivity of the closeness predicate.
In this paper, we propose a new framework to discover spatio-temporal asso-ciation rules from remote sensing images. This framework consists of a formal model definition and a three-stage algorithm, called Starsi ,fordiscovery.We modify the classical association rules model so that it becomes feasible for min-ing relations for sequential events from the satellite images. Using the proposed algorithm we can get the potential rules which may be used for future weather prediction. In this section, we present the formal model definition for the remote sensing images analysis. In addition, some specifications on the parameters X  selection are also discussed in this section. The problem is formally defined as follows:
Given:
Find: Spatio-temporal association rules A  X  B with the support factor 0  X  Objective: Completeness and Correctness.

Constraints:
In the above formulation, the problem of rule mining has the following issues which are needed to be clarified: (1). There X  X e two simple choices for n eighborhood topology of the SOM space: hexagonal lattice and rectangular lattice . In the hexagonal lattice, each node will have six neighbors. However in the rectangular la ttice, each node can have four or eight neighbors. The selection of the lattice type and the neighbor numbers is based on the type of application. (2). What X  X  the feasible time intervals for these time series images? If the images are high definition images, we need to decrease the intervals because even after a small time slot, the images will show a big difference. On the other hand, for low definition images, the intervals can be increased since the differences are not that much. In general, the Starsi algorithm consists of the following three stages:
Stage I: Clustering of image blocks
The physical position of each block contains two parts: (1)the image ID from which the block comes; and (2) the x -y position within the image after the image partition. After the third step, SOM generates a feature map. Using this map we can assign a feature ID to each block. At the same time, we can also get a feature matrix for each image. Each element of the matrix, represented by the feature ID, is just some type of representation of the block. The whole stage is illustrated by Figure 3.

Stage II: Clustering of images
The basic idea of the second stage is the same as the first stage, except that the input represents each image but not each block. After this stage, each image will also be assigned a feature ID. However this feature ID is totally different to the block X  X  feature ID, even they ma y have the same value. Therefore, each block now has two feature IDs, one represents the type of the block and the other represents the type of the image it belongs to.

Stage III: Association rules generation The last stage is to use the previous results to generate useful association rules. For the rules generation, we still use the Apriori-like algorithm that referenced before. We assessed the correctness and effectiven ess of our algorithm by experimenting with a real-life dataset. The satellite images were captured by GOES-E, which operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 1 , USA. All images are in the same size with 640  X  480 pixels in gray-scale. The total number of images is 600. The time range of these data is from May 2007 to Aug. 2007. 5.1 Experiment Design The goal of the experiment is to evaluate the effect of our model. As follows, the process can be divided into three parts: SOM map generation,Learning and Testing.

The first part is to generate two SOM maps: one for all blocks and the other for all images. All the images, including the images used only for testing later, need to be processed in this part. The reason is tha t we request the representation criteria for both learning data and testing data should be the same. M issetto12and N is set to 9. The sizes of the two SOM maps are the same: a 6  X  6 square. For the SOM learning iteration times, K , in stage one we set it as 50000 and in stage two we set it as 10000. After this part, we have two maps and two mappings: (1)represents each block with a SOM address; (2)represents each image with a SOM address. Two thirds of all the images, that is 400 images, were used as the input data for the learning data. The left im ageswereusedastestingdata. 5.2 Experiment Result The experiment has two parts: (1)the value of minsup is fixed, the correctness is generated with five different minconf values; (2)the value of minconf is fixed, the correctness is generated with five different minsup values. The sample results are illustrated in the following two figures: Figure 4 and 5. From the Figure 4, we can see that when the minsup is set to a fixed value, with the increase of the value of minconf the accuracy also has an increase. The increasing speed is higher when minconf has a higher value. From the Figure 5, when the minconf is set to a fixed value, with the increase of the value of minsup we can get almost the same situation. In this paper, we presented Starsi , a new algorithm for mining spatio-temporal patterns from remote sensing images. First, we gave a formal model of this type of problems. We then discussed in detail our solution, the three-stage algorithm and explained it step-by-step. Finally, w e used a real-life dataset to justify effec-tiveness of our algorithm. The experiments show that rules X  correctness are high when the parameter s are set properly.

One potential future work is to use other different classification or clustering methods to replace SOM in the first two s tages or use two different methods in different stages. Another one is to use other different mining methods to generate knowledge, such as decision trees.
