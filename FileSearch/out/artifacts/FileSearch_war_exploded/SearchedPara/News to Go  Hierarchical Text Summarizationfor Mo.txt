 We present an evaluation of a novel hierarchical text sum-marization method that allows users to view summaries of Web documents from small, mobile devices. Unlike previ-ous approaches, ours does not require the documents to be in HTML since it infers a hierarchical structure automat-ically. Currently, the method is used to summarize news articles sent to a Web mail account in plain text format. Subjects used a Web-enabled mobile phone emulator to ac-cess the account X  X  inbox and view the summarized news ar-ticles. They then used the summaries to complete several information-seeking tasks, which involved answering factual questions about the stories. In comparing the hierarchical text summary setting to that in which subjects were given the full text articles, there was no significant difference in task accuracy or the time taken to complete the task. How-ever, in the hierarchical summarization setting, the number of bytes transferred per user request is less than half that of the full text case. Finally, in comparing the new method to three other summarization methods, subjects achieved significantly better accuracy on the tasks when using hier-archical summaries.

 Copyright 2006 ACM 1-59593-369-7/06/0008 ... $ 5.00. Mobile Computing, Summarization Wireless access to Web content using small devices (e.g. PDAs and mobile phones) continues to be in demand by a wide range of users. From checking one X  X  email while on the road to keeping abreast of the latest news and fi-nancial information throughout the day, mobile Internet ac-cess is a promising addition to desktop Web use. However, this technology is challenged by the fact that Web pages are typically designed to be viewed using a stationary com-puter connected to the Internet through high capacity lines. To contrast, handheld devices necessarily have small screens and wireless bandwidth is limited.

In considering how to make Web browsing on small devices more efficient, previous research has taken two main direc-tions. The first approach involves reformatting or adapt-ing Web pages to be more appropriate for viewing on small screens, without altering the original content. For example, this might be done by splitting a given page into smaller parts (e.g. [3, 6]) or by delivering only the objects of a page deemed to be important (e.g. [15]) and eliminating non-essential items such as graphics. To contrast, another approach is to actually transform the content of Web pages to be more suitable for view on a small device, as suggested by Trevor and colleagues [12]. For instance, summarization of Web pages has been introduced as a means of presenting the user with only the most salient content expressed in the text on a page (e.g. [2, 14]), thus reducing the amount of information that needs to be transferred to and displayed on the user X  X  small device.

Previously, we introduced a novel method for hierarchi-cal text summarization, which is appropriate for use with mobile devices [11]. In addition, we implemented a system that emulates the use of a mobile phone for checking one X  X  Web mail. In particular, the system allows the user to ac-cess hierarchical summaries of the items in his or her inbox. In the current paper, we present a user study that evaluates the hierarchical su mmarization method, as implemented in the Web-based system, against several baselines.

Our evaluation is task-based, and emulates the experience of a user who wishes to keep informed of current news events throughout the day using his or her Web-enabled mobile phone. More specifically, the subjects in our study used the hierarchical summaries and the baselines to answer factual questions about a set of news articles emailed to the user X  X  inbox (e.g. by an online news alert service). We will show that the subjects achieved better task accuracy when us-ing the hierarchical summaries, as compared to three other summarization methods. In addition, as compared to the case where full text articles are displayed to the user, our new method reduces the number of bytes transferred per user request by more than half. Even more promising is the finding that users take no longer to complete the tasks and are just as accurate as they are in the case were they are given full text articles.
 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 1.1, we will describe the hierarchical summarization method, as well as its current implementation in a Web-based system for checking one X  X  email. After that, we will describe the setup of the study in Section 2. In Section 3, we discuss the variables studied in our experiments as well as the hypotheses that are of interest to us, while in Sec-tion 4 we present our analysis and comparison to previous work. Finally, we follow up with conclusions from our cur-rent study. Our hierarchical summarization method is illustrated in Figure 1. Given an input document, hierarchical summa-rization operates in two stages. First, it computes the salience of each sentence in the document and ranks the set of sen-tences accordingly. In order to compute the salience of each sentence, we use a linear combination of four features: Cen-troid, which measures how similar a sentence is to the overall document [10], Position (of the sentence within the source document), Length, and SimWithFirst, which measures how similar the sentence is to the first sentence in the document (often the title or headline of the news article).
In the second stage, a tree is constructed from all of the sentences such that its root is the sentence with the high-est salience and, given any sentence node with salience s at depth d , all sentences above that depth have a salience higher than s , while the salience of the rest of the sentences is below s . As shown in Figure 1, at the first level, the user is shown the set of sentences that have the highest salience score, s 1 . The order of presentation is the same as that in the source document. Sentences having a salience score less than s 1 are initially hidden from the user. However, at each point where lower-ranking sentences have been hidden, the user can expand the summary and view the sentences at the next salience level, which in this example have a salience score of s 2 .

This process is also illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the interface of the system used in our current study that we created using the DeckIt WAP mobile phone emulator. The left portion of the figure shows a view of the user X  X  email inbox, to which a set of news articles has been sent. In the right side of the figure, the user has selected to view the summary for the fourth article in the inbox. Here it can be seen that sentences 3 and 8 from this article had a salience score of s 1 and sentences 4 through 7 have been hidden at the next level. The idea behind hierarchical summarization is that the user is first shown the most important sentences in an article, in order to get the gist of the story. If he or she finds the initial summary interesting or relevant, the user may  X  X rill down X  the details of the story by expanding the message. Thus, the motive is to save time, bandwidth and screen space by displaying the most important information first, while at the same time giving the user the opportunity to expand the finer details if desired.
We conducted a user study in order to evaluate the effec-tiveness of hierarchical summarization, as implemented in our Web-based email system, in facilitating access to infor-mation in online news articles. As previously mentioned, we consider the scenario in which the user wants to keep cur-rent of news events throughout the day. We assume that the user subscribes to a service in which news articles are sent to her Web mail account, and she checks this account periodi-cally from her mobile phone to keep informed of newsworthy events.

For the study, we collected five unique sets of 10 Asso-ciated Press (APW) news articles each. The 10 articles in each set were published on the same day and were sent to the Web email inbox. In other words, each set of articles represents a snapshot of current events for that particular day. The articles included both world news events as well as financial updates. In the experiments, subjects used our system to find answers to questions about a set of 10 news stories. Below we describe the tasks and treatments ad-ministered, as well as the experimental design and study execution in detail.
For each of the five document sets used, we created an information-seeking task consisting of 10 questions (one ques-tion per each article in the document set). Following Mor-ris and colleagues [7], we used multiple choice questions in which there were five possible answers (but only one correct answer) for each question. An example of a document set (i.e. the headlines of the 10 documents) is shown in Fig-ure 3. The questions comprising each task concerned key facts about the stories or events described in the respective articles. For instance, the questions used in the task for the document set shown in Figure 3 are given in Figure 4. (The five possible answer choices for each of the 10 questions are not shown due to space limitations.) For all questions in all tasks, the answers were reported explicitly in their respec-tive articles. Therefore, it was not necessary for subjects to use previous knowledge or reasoning in order to answer the questions.
In completing a given task, a subject was assigned to one of six treatments (or system settings). In addition to the hierarchical summarization setting, we included settings at two extremes: the full text setting, in which subjects are shown the original news articles, as well as the setting in which nothing is given to the subjects other than the task questions themselves. This control setting accounts for the possibility that the questions themselves may contain some information about the news stories. Finally, we also ad-ministered three other summarization methods -a top 20% summary, a lead-based summary as well as a summary made up of randomly selected sentences. These methods are com-monly used as baselines in text summarization evaluations (e.g. the Document Understanding Conferences [9]).
Note that when using the system in each of the six treat-ment settings, for a given set of 10 documents, the user sees the same display first, which is the email inbox. The inbox shows a list of the 10 headlines of the articles in it. Table 1 describes the six treatments and explains what is displayed on the user X  X  mobile phone screen after he or she selects one of the news story headlines.
A total of 39 subjects was used in the study. They were recruited through an email sent to students studying infor-mation and computer sciences at our university. All subjects self-reported as native or near-native English speakers who were experienced Web users. Finally, they were paid for their participation in the study.

Although they were encouraged to complete all five of the tasks, the subjects were not required to do so (due to univer-sity research policies). Therefore, the researchers made sure that each of the five tasks and six treatment settings were assigned approximately equally often in the experiments. A balanced, incomplete block design was used, and the counts of each of the 30 possible document set-treatment pairings are shown in Table 2. In addition, the treatment and docu-ment set orderings were varied in order to prevent learning effects.

Before the experiments, the subjects were not given any information about the system that they would be using. They were informed that they would be participating in an information retrieval study and that its purpose was to examine how people search for information using a Web-enabled mobile phone. Finally, the subjects were told to answer the questions in each task as accurately as possible and were given unlimited time to complete the tasks. Table 2: Counts of the document set and treatment pairings.
In comparing the users X  performance on the information-seeking tasks across the six different treatments, we exam-ined the time taken to complete a task (recorded in minutes and seconds), as well as task accuracy (i.e. proportion of questions correctly answered, in which each question is ei-ther correct or incorrect). These are commonly used mea-sures in extrinsic, or task-based evaluations of text sum-marizers [4]. In addition, we also obtained the number of requests made by the user, which also corresponds to the number of mouse clicks (or hits) in this case, as well as the total number of bytes transferred while completing a task. This information was obtained from the log file of each user X  X  session (completing one task using one system setting). We then computed for each session, the number of bytes trans-ferred per user request, in order to compare the efficiency of each of the methods tested. This measure gives us an idea of how much data has to be transferred to and displayed on the user X  X  wireless device each time he or she interacts with the system.
The means of the three response variables across the six settings are shown in Table 3. The subjects were most accu-rate on the information-finding tasks when using the setting in which they were shown the full text of the news articles, with an average task accuracy of 0.94. They also took more time to complete the tasks (an average of 19.5 minutes) than they did when using the article summaries. This finding is not very surprising, as in the full text case, the answers to the questions will always be available to the user, such that it is simply a matter of taking the time to find them. How-ever, as will be shown in Section 4, the differences in time and accuracy are not significant between the full text setting and that in which subjects used hierarchical summaries to complete the tasks.

Another expected finding is that all of the summarization methods reduce the data transferred per user request, by more than half as compared to the full text setting. This is intuitive since, when using the summarization techniques, the goal is to prioritize information by ranking the sentences according to salience and to display the sentences incremen-tally in rank order. Finally, we can see that in the  X  X o sum-mary X  treatment, where subjects answered questions about a document set without access to the documents or their summaries, the accuracy is very low (an average of 0.32). Therefore, there is no evidence that the questions them-selves contain too much information about the news stories and we are not concerned about the task being trivial.
In the next section, we will concentrate on answering three research questions using the data from the user study: 1. Are there significant differences between the
The means of the three response variables, time to task completion, task accuracy and bytes transferred per hit, which are shown in Table 3, appear to differ between the five systems. In addition, in assigning subjects to a given task (i.e. set of documents and questions to answer) and set-ting, we tried to ensure an approximately even distribution of task-setting pairing. Nonetheless, we want to investigate the effect of the five system treatments on the three response variables when the possible effects of the task are controlled. For example, it may be the case that some tasks were more difficult than others. Likewise, it could be possible that cer-tain task and system combinations resulted in longer task completion times or lower rates of accuracy. 2. Are there any significant differences in task per-
If we establish, in investigating our first research ques-tion, that there is a significant system effect on the three response variables, then we should make pairwise compar-isons between the five systems. In particular, as shown in Table 3, the highest mean task accuracy (0.94) occurs when subjects use the full text of the news documents to complete the tasks. To contrast, the accuracy when using the hier-archical text summaries of the news articles is slightly less, at 0.83. After that, we see a drop off, as the system with the next best accuracy, the lead-based summary setting, has a mean accuracy of only 0.68. Therefore, we will compare the hierarchical summary case versus the full text setting in order to see if the differences between them are statistically significant. 3. Are there significant differences between the hi-
Finally, we wish to compare the three response variables between the hierarchical summarization setting and the three other summarization methods. As mentioned previously, these three methods are commonly viewed as baseline sys-tems. As can be seen in Table 3, all four of the summariza-tion methods reduce the number of bytes transferred per Response variable Setting Task Setting*Task Time 0.0033 0.0944 0.3714 Accuracy 0.0000 0.0549 0.0756 Bytes per click 0.0000 0.0023 0.4222 Table 4: P-values for predictors Setting, Task and their interaction for ANOVAs on each response vari-able. hit, as compared to the full text case. Therefore, we want to investigate whether the new, hierarchical summarization method offers any significant advantages over the baseline methods in terms of the users X  performance on the tasks.
Below, we analyze the data collected from our user study in order to address the three research questions put forward in the previous section.
In order to examine if there is an overall setting (or sys-tem) effect, when controlling for the task administered to the subjects, we conducted an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each of the three response variables, which were all approx-imately normally distributed. First, we removed the cases where subjects were given only the tasks with no source ar-ticles or summaries (a control setting), in order to consider only the differences between the five systems (where either the full text documents were given to the user or one of the four types of summaries). In each ANOVA, the predic-tors were the setting used, the task/document set used, and the interaction between the given setting and task. For the ANOVAs on each of the three response variables, Table 4 shows the p-values of the three predictor variables.
As can be seen in the table, the setting effect is highly sig-nificant in all three ANOVAs, even when controlling for the effect of task. In fact, at the 5% significance level, the effect of the task assigned was significant in only one case, when the number of bytes per click is the response variable. Like-wise, at this level, the interaction effect between the task and the system assigned is not significant for any of the response variables. (However, at the 10% level, the inter-action is significant in the ANOVA of the response variable  X  X ccuracy. X )
Therefore, we can conclude that there are significant dif-ferences between the five system settings in terms of the average time to complete the information-seeking task, the average task accuracy, and the number of bytes transferred per mouse click, even when we control the effects of the tasks and the interaction between the setting and task adminis-tered.
Having established that there are significant differences between the five system settings, we can now make pair-wise comparisons between them, in order to see which sys-tems are better than others, in the context of the current task. Post-ANOVA pairwise tests can be conducted using the Bonferroni method [8]. Table 5 displays the differences in the average task completion times, task accuracy and Table 5: P-values for the differences in the response variables between the full text and hierarchical sum-marization settings. bytes transferred per hit, between the full text setting and that in which users were shown hierarchical summaries of the documents in the email inbox. In addition, the corre-sponding Bonferroni-corrected p-values are shown.
We can see that the differences between the two systems with respect to the average time taken to complete the task and the task accuracy are not statistically significant, hav-ing large p-values of 1 and 0.6, respectively. To contrast, the difference in the mean number of bytes transferred is highly significant, with a p-value of 0. The interpretation of these findings is that there is no evidence of significant performance differences on the task of finding answers to questions about a set of news stories between the two set-tings. However, the use of hierarchical summarization in delivering newsworthy information to a user X  X  mobile phone reduces the number of bytes transferred to the wireless de-vice each time the user interacts with the system.
The post-ANOVA pairwise comparison tests were also used to examine the differences in the response variables between the hierarchical summarization setting and each of the three baseline summarization methods. The statistically significant differences are shown in Table 6 along with their corresponding p-values. It should be noted that the differ-ence in accuracy between the hierarchical and the lead-based summarization methods is not significant at the 5% level, but only at the more lenient significance level of 10%.
As can be seen, users achieved better task accuracy when using the hierarchical summaries, as compared to the other three summarization methods. On average, the users took 4.8 minutes less to complete the tasks when using the ran-dom summaries as compared to the hierarchical summaries. However, the low accuracy achieved using randomly-created summaries (average accuracy of 0.59 as compared to 0.83 in the hierarchical summary setting) confirms one X  X  intu-ition that the randomly generated summaries are of a rela-tively poor quality. Therefore, we suspect that the shorter task completion times might reflect users  X  X iving up X  on a search task if they are unable to find the answers to ques-tions after exerting significant efforts. In conclusion, while the hierarchical summarization method does not offer an advantage over the baselines in terms of the time taken to complete the information-seeking tasks, the users achieved significantly better task accuracy using the new method.
The previous work closest to ours is that of Buyukkok-ten and colleagues [1, 2], who introduced a technique called  X  X ccordion summarization. X  This is similar to our method in that the basic idea is to reduce the amount of data trans-ferred to a mobile device by showing the user information in-summarization settings. crementally. However, one major difference with our work is that their method relies on HTML artifacts that denote page fragments such as paragraphs and lists, in first identifying Semantic Textual Units (STUs). Once STUs are identified, they are then subjected to micro-level text summarization. To contrast, our method does not require that documents are in HTML format, as a hierarchical structure is inferred automatically using perceived sentence salience.

In addition, Buyukkokten and colleagues conducted a small user study in which 15 subjects performed information-seeking tasks using a PDA emulator. However, the tasks adminis-tered to the subjects included both factual questions as well as locating particular pages on the Web, while our work fo-cuses on finding the answers to factual questions in news articles. Their best summarization method, which first dis-played keywords for a Web page followed by the most salient sentence, was shown to reduce the users X  search time as com-pared to other summarization schemes. They do not report on the users X  accuracy on the information-seeking tasks ad-ministered.

In another related project, Yang and Wang proposed a summarization method for small mobile devices based on the fractal theory [14]. In their approach, a skeleton summary is first generated for an input document, which is based on the document X  X  structure. For example, an HTML news docu-ments might be made up of sections, paragraphs, sentences, terms and then words. Once the skeleton of the document has been generated, finer details can be added, in creating a summary of the document. As in the work of Buyukkokten and colleagues, the proposed fractal summarization method relies on an input Web document being formatted in HTML in order to infer its structure. While Yang and Wang also applied their method to the task of summarizing news doc-uments for delivery to mobile devices in [13], they did not conduct any task-based evaluations of their approach.
The tasks we assigned to users in our study were similar to those used by Morris and colleagues [7]. In their work, they examined the effects of extractive text condensing (or extractive summarization) on users X  reading comprehension. Subjects completed tasks taken from a GMAT exam, which consisted of sets of multiple choice questions. Treatments included being shown the full text of the corresponding pas-sage, an abstract of the summary constructed by an expert or extractive summaries of varying length. They found no significant differences in reading comprehension (measured as task accuracy) between the full text case as compared to the settings in which users were given human-constructed abstracts or 30% or 20% extractive summaries. Similarly, we also found no difference in accuracy between the full text and hierarchical summary se ttings in our experiments.
Finally, another recent task-based evaluation of summa-rization techniques was conducted by McKeown and col-leagues in the context of the Newsblaster system 1 [5]. While their work did not concern summarization for mobile de-vices, their goal was to evaluate the usefulness of multi-document summarization in helping users  X  X ake better use of the news. X  In their study, users were given summaries of a set of news documents about a particular topic, and were asked to write a summary report describing the main facts of the story. Four treatment settings were investigated: the use of full documents with no summary, a lead-based summary, a summary produced by Newsblaster, and human-created summaries. Their results showed that using the system-produced summaries resulted in better reports than did the use of documents only or the lead-based summaries. In sum, the findings of previous studies clearly demonstrate that summarization is a useful tool that can reduce the amount of text users must read without hindering their comprehension of the key ideas expressed, and the findings of our current study also concur with this conclusion.
We presented a user evaluation of a novel method for hi-erarchical extractive text summarization that is appropriate for use with mobile devices. Our method was tested in the context of a Web mail system, which allows a user to access his or her inbox, to which a set of news articles has been sent. We tested the use of hierarchical summaries against the use of full text documents as well as three baseline sum-marization methods (top 20%, lead-based and random) on the task of finding answers to questions about the given news stories. We found that there was no significant difference in terms of task accuracy and completion times between the full text document and hierarchical summarization settings. In addition, the use of the hierarchical summaries reduces the number of bytes per user request by more than half.
To our knowledge, the current work is unique both in terms of the summarization method used (hierarchical ex-tractive summarization), as well as the application and task proposed (that of using a wireless mobile phone to keep up-to-date on the latest news events and financial information). In addition, previous work in summarization for mobile de-vices has either not been evaluated extrinsically (e.g. [13]) or has been evaluated on a rather small sample of users [2].
Finally, the application used in the current study ad-dresses a real information retrieval need. In particular, as more information is transmitted electronically and is easily available on the Web, the more people require tools to man-http : //newsblaster.cs.columbia.edu age this information in a timely and efficient manner. A clear example of a user who would rely on such a system is a professional who needs access to the most recently avail-able, newsworthy information in order to make informed decisions, even when he or she is not in front of a desktop computer. The current work has shown that hierarchical summarization can enhance the experience of such users in using small, wireless devices by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred to the user X  X  phone or PDA, without adversely affecting his or her comprehension of the information of interest. Therefore, we plan to deploy hier-archical summarization in a number of ways. In particular, we will link the system we implemented to our online news service, NewsInEssence 2 . While NewsInEssence already al-lows users to request to receive news updates and summaries via email, in the future, we may also offer them the option of receiving hierarchical su mmaries, so that they may read them on their wireless devices. In addition, in future work, we plan to extend our hierarchical summarization system so that it may be personalized by users, allowing them to summarize other types of texts that they need to be able to access while away from their desktop computers (e.g. email).
