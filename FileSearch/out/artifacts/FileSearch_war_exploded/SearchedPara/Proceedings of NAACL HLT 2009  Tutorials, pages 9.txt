 Finite-state methods are well established in language and speech processing. OpenFst (available from www.openfst.org ) is a free and open-source software library for building and using finite automata, in particular, weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs). This tutorial is an introduction to weighted finite-state transducers and their uses in speech and language processing. While there are other weighted finite-state transducer libraries, OpenFst (a) offers, we believe, the most comprehensive, general and efficient set of operations; (b) makes available full source code; (c) exposes high-and low-level C++ APIs that make it easy to embed and extend; and (d) is a platform for active research and use among many colleagues. This tutorial is intended for students, researchers, and practitioners interested in applying finite-state methods. It is suitable for participants of a variety of backgrounds, including those without any back-ground in finite-state techniques as well as advanced users of existing software packages. For those unfamiliar with finite-state transducers, the first portion of the tutorial provides an introduction to the theory and application areas. Users of other finite-state libraries will particularly benefit from the con-trastive description of the unique features of OpenFst, its C++ API, and the examples drawn from real-world applications. Michael Riley began his career at Bell Labs and AT&amp;T Labs where he, together with Mehryar Mohri and Fernando Pereira, introduced and developed the theory and use of weighted finite-state transducers (WF-STs) in speech and language. This work was recognized in best paper awards from the journals Speech Communication and Computer Speech and Language . He has been a research scientist at Google, Inc. since 2003. He is a principal author of the OpenFst library and the AT&amp;T FSM Library TM . He has given several tutorials on WFSTs before: at ACL 1994, Coling 1997 and Interspeech 2002.
 Cyril Allauzen is another key author of the OpenFst library. His main research interests are in finite-state methods and their applications to text, speech and natural language processing and machine learning. Before joining Google, he worked as a researcher at AT&amp;T Labs  X  Research and at NYU X  X  Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.
 Martin Jansche has applied the OpenFst library to several speech and language problems at Google. His FST-related interests are in text processing for speech tasks and in learning and applying pronunciation and transliteration models.
