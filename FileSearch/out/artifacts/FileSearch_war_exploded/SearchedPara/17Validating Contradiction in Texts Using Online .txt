 RICHARD TZONGHAN TSAI, YuanZE University In natural language processing (NLP), the term textual entailment (TE) refers to a directional relation between two text segments, usually sentences. TE can be said to exist when the truth of one text segment follows from that of another. The entailing segment is termed t while the entailed text (hypothesis) is termed h . Textual entail-ment has a more relaxed definition than pure logical entailment:  X  t entails h  X ( t  X  h ) if, normally, a person reading t would infer that h is probably true [Monz and Rijke 2001]. TE relations are considered directional because even if  X  t entails h X , the reverse  X  h entails t  X  may not be true [Marneffe et al. 2008].

Many NLP applications, such as question answering, information extraction, and machine translation evaluation, could make use of a model that would allow them to recognize whether the same meaning can be inferred from different sentence vari-ants. At the 2004 PASCAL challenge, Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) was first proposed as a generic task that can fulfill semantic inference needs in many NLP applications [Dagan et al. 2005]. Since then, RTE has become a popular research topic in NLP research.

Textual entailment can generally be categorized into three different relation types [Giampiccolo and Magnini 2007]: Positive TE (text entails hypothesis), negative TE (text contradicts hypothesis), and non-TE (text neither entails nor contradicts hypothe-sis). Early RTE challenges asked participants to determine whether or not a given sen-tence positively entails another sentence, which is a binary classification task. Since RTE-3 (2007), identification of the latter two relation types has been included. The Recognizing Inference in TExt (RITE) task, another RTE task held at the 9th Annual Meeting of NII Test Collection for IR Systems (NTCIR), further extended the relation types to five and included Japanese and traditional and simplified Chinese language datasets [Shima et al. 2011]. Most teams today, however, still focus on identifying positive TEs and usually obtain better performances for this type.

As a participant of RITE at NTCIR-9, we proposed a knowledge-based hybrid ap-proach and developed a Chinese RTE system consisting of several independent mod-ules [Shih et al. 2011]. We simultaneously classify the entailment direction (forward, reverse, bidirectional), contradiction and independent (otherwise) by using modules which use shallow text features such as sentence alignment, token similarity, pres-ence of named entities, syntactically dependent word pairs, negative expressions, and length difference between text and hypothesis sentences. The scores for all entailment relations are integrated by a voting strategy, and the relation with the highest vote is considered the result. Our system achieved accuracy scores of 0.661 and 0.501 for traditional Chinese binary and multiple-class subtasks, respectively. The system was ranked the highest among fully automatic systems in the RITE traditional Chinese category.

After doing error analysis on the RITE results, we found a possible direction to improve the ability of identifying contradictory statements. This relation type got a maximum F -score of 0.368, which effectively lowered the overall accuracy. Poor performance in this type indicates that relying only on the occurrence of negations and some antonyms for contradiction detection is insufficient to discriminate conflicts from unrelated (unknown) text pairs. This observation motivated us to investigate the characteristics of contradictory statements, strategies for detecting them, and the effects of more accurate contradiction detection.

In propositional logic, the definition of contradiction is that two statements cannot both be true at the same time; nevertheless, in text comprehension, contradictory cases do not necessarily match such a strict definition but rely on human intuition. According to Marneffe et al. [2008], the primary types of contradiction can be de-fined as: (1) those occurring via overt negations such as antonyms, negations, and time/date/number mismatches; and (2) contradictions resulting from factive/modal words, text structure, certain lexical contrasts, and word knowledge. Unlike the former type, which may only need a little external information for detection, conflict cases of the second type cannot be solved without large amounts of presupposition, background knowledge, and even specific know-how. Take the following sentences, for example.
There are no negations or antonym pairs in these two sentences. The mismatches  X   X   X   X  (queen) and  X   X  X  X   X  (princess) in this sentence pair might be treated as two ordinary words. However, these two sentences are contradictory for the notion that generally one person may not play two characters in a single movie. Although a dual role is possible in filmmaking, its possibility is quite low that most people would regard these two as contradictory. One possible way to deal with this issue is to create or col-lect rules to detect the mismatch in a pair, but it would be extremely difficult to have a set of rules that is complete enough to handle most contradictory cases because many of them are defined by the context, not by the mismatched parts. In the example pair,  X   X   X   X  (queen) and  X   X  X  X   X  (princess) can co-exist in some situations, such as eating together or traveling together, however, relations such, playARole (PersonA, Queen) and playARole (PersonA, Princess) , rarely co-exist in an event. In other words, the contradiction is true because of the same relation and same subject, which defines the contradictory context. The cost of collecting enough rules to cope with all possible mis-matches is very high. For this reason, it is clear that we do not have a good chance of identifying contradictions between two sentences without external information. Such difficult cases, in which contradiction can only be detected with specific background knowledge, are widespread in written language.
 In this article, we focus on detecting contradiction in traditional Chinese (CT) text. More specifically, we first investigate a RITE dataset and categorize types of contradic-tory statements according to the linguistic phenomena and which manifest the prob-lem of knowledge shortage. Furthermore, we propose an approach of using a search engine to aid in the detection of contradictions. Critical mismatches are validated along with their contexts based on search engine result counts returned by suitable query strings. These query strings are carefully designed so that the contradiction level can be measured in terms of search result counts. The purpose of this research is to emphasize the seriousness of knowledge insufficiency in contradiction detection, and provide a novel approach of using co-mention patterns to extract essential but scanty knowledge from the Internet for contradiction judgment.

The rest of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a brief review of con-tradiction detection within the framework of textual entailment recognition. Section 3 describes the categories of linguistic phenomena and the problem of knowledge short-age. Section 4 introduces our method of using the mismatch conjunction of phrase and web query to detect contradictions in a text. Section 5 introduces our baseline RITE system, IASLD, and then the experiments and the results from two different aspects for estimating the effect of our approach will be conducted in Section 6. We analyze and discuss the approach on contradiction detection in Section 7, and finally present the conclusion in Section 8. The amount of research dedicated to finding contradictions in texts is limited. Crouch et al. [2003] was the first study to suggest that contradiction detection should be con-sidered as important as positive entailment detection. Later, Harabagiu et al. [2006] proposed an approach to discover contradictions such as negations and antonyms us-ing two strategies: (1) identifying and removing negations of propositions, and (2) extracting linguistic information of negations, contrasts and antonyms from the text for training a classifier. Ritter et al. [2008], on the other hand, conducted a deep anal-ysis of the RTE-3 extended task and addressed some issues with and potential direc-tions for contradictory statement generation and justification. Marneffe et al. [2008] not only described corpus annotation guidelines and several types of contradiction but also proposed some salient features (such as number/date/time, negations, antonyms, factivity, modality, relations, and structures) useful in identifying incompatible infor-mation in texts. Building on this work, Voorhees [2008] focused on contradictions that can only be resolved with background knowledge and described a case study of contradiction detection based on functional relations. Magnini and Cabrio [2010] intro-duced a novel methodology for the qualitative analysis of a TE system focusing on con-tradiction judgments based on decomposing text-hypothesis pairs into monothematic pairs.

In RTE-4 and RTE-5, more than 20 participants in the three-type RTE subtask presented strategies for dealing with contradictions. Most of these approaches looked for the presence of negations and antonyms. Other cues, such as time, date, num-ber, location name, quantifiers were widely used to improve the accuracy of contradic-tion detection. In addition, utilization of dictionaries and databases such as WordNet [Fellbaum 1998], VerbNet [Kipper-Schuler 2005], Wikipedia, or inference rule sets such as DIRT [Lin and Pantel 2001] were also common. Systems such as Clark and Harrison [2008] introduced the use of logical forms for RTE. Pado et al. [2008] re-lied on filtering non-coreferent events to distinguish irrelevant sentence pairs from mismatched cases. Machine-learning-based RTE systems such as those described in Castillo [2009], on the other hand, tend to gather all available features to train a tex-tual relation classifier which can automatically distinguish entailed texts from non-entailed cases. Moreover, some participants, such as Iftene [2008] and Iftene and Moruz [2009], proposed a sophisticated hybrid system, applying a mapping from every node in the hypothesis tree to one node from the text tree to compute a fitness score for differentiating entailments from non-entailed pairs. We discuss linguistic phenomena of contradictions and the knowledge insufficiency problem in this section. As mentioned earlier, Marneffe et al. [2008] suggested a primary contradiction classi-fication strategy and clearly pointed out that the difficulty of tackling the second type of contradiction, which is associated with factive/modal words, text structure, certain lexical contrasts, and word knowledge. Magnini and Cabrio [2010] also found that the second type of contradiction is much more frequent in textual entailment datasets than in ordinary newswire documents and Wikipedia; and overt negations, which of-ten appear in these datasets, are not as effective for entailment judgment. Moreover, the linguistic phenomena that cause two statements to become contradictive are quite varied and complicated. These factors make contradiction detection in RTE datasets a more challenging task.

In order to successfully recognize entailments and contradictions, developers and researchers have created a variety of new features, algorithms, and knowledge re-sources to address specific type of linguistic phenomena in entailed and contradictory cases. However, as Bentivogli et al. [2010] pointed out, it is very difficult to mea-sure the impact of these new methods due to (1) the sparseness of the linguistic phe-nomena and (2) the difficulty of isolating each linguistic phenomenon for independent evaluation.

To deal with the above problems, some previous research attempted to break the textual entailment problem down into certain isolated  X  X spects X . Magnini and Cabrio [2009] first proposed subdividing the TE problem into a set of monothematic pairs . By means of human judgment, monothematic pairs can be created based on linguistic phenomena relevant to the entailment relation. For example, the TH pair, can be resolved (i.e., judged as contradictive) by means of quantity inconsistency be-tween the two sentences (18 vs. 58). There is no other knowledge involved in the en-tailment. Magnini and Cabrio defined such an instance as a monothematic pair with respect to the quantity phenomenon. Later, Bentivogli et al. [2010] extended and re-fined Magnini and Cabrio X  X  methodology, providing five macro categories of linguistic phenomena related to contradiction that are present in the RTE-5 dataset. The five macro categories are as follows.  X  Lexical, which includes identity, format, acronymy, demonymy, synonymy, semantic opposition, hyperonymy, and geographical knowledge.  X  Lexical-syntactic, which includes transparent heads, nominalization, verbalization, causatives, and paraphrases.  X  Syntactic, which includes negation, modifiers, argument realization, apposition, lists, coordination, and active/passive alternation.  X  Discourse, which includes coreference, apposition, zero anaphora, ellipsis, and statements.  X  Reasoning, which includes apposition, modifiers, genitives, relative clauses, elliptic expressions, meronymy, metonymy, membership, representativeness, reasoning on quantities, temporal and spatial reasoning, and all the general inferences using background knowledge.
 Bentivogli X  X  work took a new perspective on using linguistic phenomena of TH pairs to simplify the complexity of TE problems. It also pointed out the possibility of classifying TE problems via linguistic phenomena relevant to entailment relation determination.

Returning to contradiction detection, Magnini and Cabrio [2010] followed the work of Bentivogli et al. [2010] to investigate linguistic phenomena related to contradic-tory pairs in the RTE-5 dataset. According to their observations, contradictions are mainly triggered by phenomena such as quantity mismatching, antonymy, apposition mismatching, and general inference. Negations, on the other hand, were surprisingly relevant to only one TH pair X  X  contradiction. Their work also revealed the contribution probability of linguistic phenomena toward positive or negative assignment. Accord-ing to their statistics, some linguistic phenomena, like antonyms, are more reliable in detecting contradictions, whereas other linguistic phenomena that appeared in contra-dictions may also be found in entailed text pairs. Furthermore, the distribution of the five macro categories of contradiction-related linguistic phenomena is still unknown in the Chinese RITE dataset. In order to gain a deeper understanding of contradiction behavior in RITE, we examined contradictory cases in the Traditional Chinese (TC) RITE development dataset, and analyzed the distribution of the linguistic phenomena related to negative relation assignment. Table I shows the linguistic phenomena and the number of corresponding contradictory TH pairs in the RITE TC multiple classifi-cation (MC) development set.
 Decomposing TH pairs into monothematic pairs reveals the relevance and contribution of linguistic phenomena to contradiction detection. But for some linguistic phenomena, it is difficult to create corresponding monothematic pairs from TH pairs without hu-man supervision, especially for those TH pairs with deep reasoning or complicated grammatical structures. Most of the contradiction detection systems focus their atten-tion on investigating more explicit linguistic phenomena such as negations, antonyms, modifiers, and lexicon mismatches. These linguistic phenomena, which can mostly be found in literal mismatches between T and H, are the main clues for contradiction detection for these systems. In our analysis of the RITE TC corpus, problems relat-ing to the incompleteness of background knowledge were discovered in the following linguistic phenomena. (1) Incompleteness of background knowledge in antonym identification.
 Antonymy relations, which are one of the most trustworthy phenomenon types in RITE, are generally obtained from thesauri such as WordNet. In Chinese, knowledge resources such as E-hownet [Chen et al. 2005] and Sinica Bow [Huang et al. 2004] provide opposing terms and antonymy information as well. Unfortunately, dictionary-based antonym identification suffers from the fact that only a limited number of antonym instances are available, as can be seen in the following TH pair: Obviously the mismatches between two sentences  X   X  X  X   X  (an old enemy) and  X   X  X  X  X   X  (a good friend) are antonyms. However, we find hardly any antonymy relations be-tween these two terms in all available Chinese knowledge resources. (2) Incompleteness of background knowledge in lexicon mismatches.
 Similar background knowledge shortages not only happen with antonyms, but can also be detected in ordinary lexicon mismatches in TH pairs, such as in the following example.
 (The winner of the Lasker Award usually receives the Nobel Prize within two years) (The winner of the Lasker Award always receives the Nobel Prize within two years) (4) In this example, the two sentences conflict due to the difference between  X   X  X  X   X  (usually) and  X   X  X  X   X  (always). Even if the meanings of these mismatches can be found in dictionaries, it is hard to determine if they cause these TH pairs contradictive. (3) Incompleteness of background knowledge in reasoning.
 Another knowledge shortage problem worth noting regarding contradiction is rea-soning. As Magnini and Cabrio [2010] reported, the reasoning category is the most frequent of all linguistic phenomena in the RTE-5 dataset. The requirements of back-ground knowledge, however, make resolving statements containing implicit incompat-ibilities difficult. This argument can be supported by the low contribution probability of reasoning phenomena in contradiction judgment (0.41). For example in the sentence pair, there is no contradiction . However, if we rewrite Example (5) as there seems to be a conflict because generally people do not wear a skirt and pants at the same time. If we switch the main verb of Example (5) to the following, the sentences in Example (6) turn out to be compatible again. The reason why Exam-ple (6) is incompatible is obvious, but such general knowledge facts, which are almost always unstated, are not usually found in dictionaries. These types of contradictions arising from predicate mismatches are rarely considered.

Generally speaking, the issues described above are due to a shortage of background knowledge. Unlike other linguistic phenomena which have more easily identifiable patterns or features, contradictory statements caused by specific background knowl-edge may occur in any kind of TH pair mismatches. Furthermore, the knowledge in-sufficiency problem is encountered in most linguistic phenomena in the lexicon, syn-tactic, and reasoning categories. To the best of our knowledge, few previous studies have endeavored to explore contradictions caused by background knowledge and com-mon sense knowledge, and there has been little research into solving the deficiency of required information like oppositions (antonyms). Thus, researchers and devel-opers of entailment recognition or contradiction detection systems usually face the predicament that even if there is only one mismatch between two literally matched statements, it is still difficult to determine whether or not the in-between relation is contradictive because of the unavailability of necessary background knowledge about the mismatches. For this reason, we believe that developing a complementary mecha-nism to obtain essential background knowledge is vital. When considering the derivation of knowledge for contradiction detection, Web content is always a good choice as the resource to retrieve useful information. We soon realized the serious problem that people take background knowledge such as lexicon meaning, common sense, term usage, term relations, and presuppositions for granted and do not provide extra explanations when making an utterance on the Web. Fortunately, on the other hand, those utterances will not contradict the common sense, presuppositions, and implicit language regulations, such as term usage constraints. We may further argue that if a statement never happened on the web, this might be an implication that this statement is incorrect or unreasonable. In view of this, merging mismatch segments between texts into a single statement and checking its availability on the Web might be a workable and practical solution for detecting implicit incompatibili-ties, since those incorrect or unreasonable merging which may go against the common usage of language or background knowledge will be recognized for getting no hits or an extremely low number of hits in a Web search. Some previous research utilized text distributions for exploring synonyms from the Web. Lin et al. [2003] proposed a methodology of using patterns such as  X  X rom X to Y  X ,  X  X ither X or Y  X  to distinguish synonyms and antonyms. However, their work did not address the contradiction oc-curring via background knowledge but only focused on acquiring a synonym list from a Web query. Further, some patterns they used in their work do not have suitable correspondents in Chinese. Thus, we need to design a new procedure with the goal of detecting combinations of incompatible mismatch segments in Chinese TE via the infrequency of unreasonable mismatch conjunction phrases on the Web. Details of this will be described in the next paragraph. After analyzing contradiction pairs in the RITE corpus, we noticed a finding from the observations: if both T and H contain only one mismatch between TH pairs, then the relation between the mismatch segments mostly indicates the relation between TH pairs. We define such a mismatch as a critical mismatch . After deriving the critical mismatch segments of a TH pair, we can try to connect them by certain conjunctions to form a new statement. In Example (8), the underlined sequences are critical mismatch segments of the two sentences. We can combine these two critical mismatch segments as  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X (the most powerful and most noticeable) by inserting a conjunction  X   X   X  (and). As a matter of course, the connection process may produce strange statements, such as the follow-ing instance. The connected mismatch segments  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  184  X   X  (was located in China and lasted 184 days) looks uncommon in Chinese. Another noticeable case of merg-ing occurs in the connection of two opposite statements, like the mismatch segments  X   X  X  X   X  (an old enemy) and  X   X  X  X  X   X  (a good friend) in Example (2) that generate a statement such as  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X  (an old enemy and a good friend).

Hence, a definition of combining mismatch segments, which we call mismatch con-junction phrases (MCP), is given.

Definition 4.1 ( Mismatch Conjunction Phrases, MCP). assume Mis(X) and Mis(Y) represent the mismatch segments in sentence X and sentence Y. A mismatch conjunc-tions phrase MCP(X,Y) is defined as Where  X + X  concatenates two strings. Conj stands for the conjunction. FuncP and FuncS , which represent functional prefix and suffix, consist of manually collected Chinese function characters such as  X   X   X (de),  X   X   X  (is). These functional prefixes and suffixes are used for three reasons. (1) to make the generated MCP more fluent, (2) to increase the matched webpage numbers, and (3) to avoid finding Web pages with unmatched or misaligned Chinese segmentation.

We introduce the process of generating mismatch conjunction phrases later in this section. Two issues need to be addressed in the process of generating MCPs of TH pairs. First, the conjunction used to combine two mismatch segments together should be refined beforehand. Second, the TH pair types, which include or exclude from the process of generating MCPs, should be determined.

Let us assume first that a mismatch is critical. Coordinating conjunctions, which are one type of conjunction and can join two or more items of equal syntactic impor-tance [Curzan and Adams 2005], are applied to connect two mismatch segments to generate an MCP. With different coordinating conjunctions, different MCPs are pro-duced. Coordinating conjunctions such as  X   X   X  (and),  X   X   X   X  (and), and  X   X   X  (and) are used to bind two co-existing constituents; the other coordinating conjunctions such as  X   X   X  (denoting an exception),  X   X   X  (denoting a range),  X   X   X  (denoting an option), and  X   X   X  (denoting  X  X nd so forth X ) join two or more opposite, unrelated, or similar items together. Moreover, according to Academia Sinica [1993], the association or collocation of coordinating conjunctions and their constituents still vary from the constituents X  part-of-speech (POS). To be more specific, the coordinating conjunctions used to con-nect nouns are different from those which are used to connect verbs, adjectives, and adverbs in practical use. Therefore, while generating MCPs, we use coordinating con-junctions corresponding to the POS tag of the constituents. Table II shows the list of conjunctions, their functions, and the constituents X  POS in the generation processing. We use mismatched segments  X   X   X  (powerful) and  X   X  X  X   X  (noticeable) in Example (8) to demonstrate the process of generating an MCP: the conjunctions for adjectives are  X   X   X  (and), and  X   X   X  (and). And the functional suffix for adjectives is  X   X   X  (de). Accord-ing to Definition 4.1, two MCPs of this mismatch segments pair,  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X nd  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  (powerful and noticeable), are generated.

Not all the TH pairs are suitable for generating MCPs. We skip TH pairs with more than two mismatched segments on each side. This constraint, based on the assump-tion that if there is only one mismatch in a TH pair, then the mismatch is critical and is used to remove mismatches of little significance to the relation judgment. Further-more, TH pairs with highly complicated linguistic phenomena are also excluded by this constraint because more mismatches may indicate more complicated contradic-tion phenomena within; in any case, the TH pairs with highly complicated linguistic phenomena are not our targets to resolve. As mentioned before, our purpose is to find unreasonable MCPs, which may indicate the existence of a contradictory binding of mismatched segments. Therefore, a strat-egy to distinguish the reasonableness/unreasonableness of MCPs is needed. We found that the AND conjunction phrases, which contain the conjunction  X  X nd X , tend to be utilized for connecting two co-existing and non-conflicting constituents. On the other hand, the disjunctive conjunction, such as  X  X r X , mostly link two opposite concepts. The distribution of MCPs with these two types of conjunctions may display the compatible degree between mismatched segments. In other words, the reasonableness or unrea-sonableness of mismatching segment combinations leads the distribution difference of the MCPs. In addition, some TE contradictions are constructed from the opposition of the meaning between critical mismatch segments, but some incompatibilities re-sult in the unreasonable co-existence of combinations of verb and mismatch segments. Example (6) demonstrates how two verb-mismatch combinations bring about a contra-diction. Accordingly, while searching for incompatibilities in texts, taking the verbs of mismatched segments into account is necessary.

We apply a step-by-step Web-based checking procedure to show how we use MCPs querying to identify contradictions. Initially, assume Mis ( T )and Mis ( H ) are critical mismatch segments of a TH pair. A set of MCPs, MCP and ( T , H ), which consist of all possible combinations of AND conjunctions and functional prefixes/suffixes, is gener-ated. Considering the connecting order, the MCP and ( H , T ), in which the order of con-stituents are exchanged, is produced as well. Thereafter, the query strings of MCPs, QSMCP , are generated. The definition of QSMCP is defined as follows.

Definition 4.2 ( Query Strings of MCP, QSMCP ). Assume MCP(X, Y) represents a mismatch conjunction phrase of mismatch segments Mis(X) and Mis(Y). The verb of the Mis(X) and Mis(Y) in sentence X and sentence Y is represented as V. Then the query strings of MCP(X, Y), QSMCP(X, Y) are defined as: According to Definition 4.2, query strings of mismatched segments, Mis(T) and Mis(H) ,andtheMCPs MCP and ( T , H )and MCP and ( T , H ), are produced as QSMis(T) , QSMis(H) , QSMCP and ( T , H )and QSMCP and ( H , T ) respectively; all the query strings are thrown into a search engine to get the number of found Web pages. The availabil-ity value AV and is proposed to estimate the prevalence of mismatch conjunctions. The definition of availability value is as follows.

Definition 4.3 (Availability Value, AV) . Assume Mis(X) and Mis(Y) represent the mismatched segments in sentence X and sentence Y. QSMCP and (T , H) and QSMCP and (H , T) are the query strings of MCP and (T , H), MCP and (T , H). Then the avail-ability value of Mis(X), Mis(Y) and AND conjunction is defined as: AV and ( Mis ( X ) , Mis ( Y ))= where HitNum(X) is the number of matched Web pages with Web query string X.
As just mentioned, MCPs with OR conjunctions should also be produced. We com-pute the availability value of  X  X r X  MCPs as AV or ( Mis ( X ) , Mis ( Y )) = where QSMCP or (X, Y) and QSMCP or (X, Y) are appended from optional MCPs MCR or (X, Y) and MCR or (X, Y).
 Low availability value may indicate unreasonableness. The difference between AV and and AV or show the appearance tendency of two mismatch segments combined in one single conjunction phrase, and point out the possible semantic relation be-tween two mismatch segments. MCPs with higher AV and and lower AV or are rarely regarded as containing two compatible mismatched segments; MCPs with lower AV and and higher AV or , on the contrary, may merge two contradictory statements into one phrase. For those MCPs combining two synonyms, with completely unrelated items, and with long, complicated mismatches, it is highly possible to get zero or an extremely low number of both AV and and AV and since people do not tend to put these statements together into a conjunction phrase. Thus, an empirical threshold  X  is predefined. If AV &lt; X  , the TH pair will be considered as either having synonymy mismatches or being unrelated. We use the following describe the determination rule of contradictions. Hence, the process of MCP-based contradiction detection contains the following steps. (1) Extract critical mismatch segments Mis(T) and Mis(H) from the TH pair. (2) Generate MCP and (T, H), MCP and (H, T), MCP or (T, H), and MCP or (H, T) from Mis(T) (3) Use all MCPs along with the verb V to form QSMCP and ( T , H ), QSMCP and ( H , T ) (4) Obtain AV and (Mis(T), Mis(H)) and AV or (Mis(T), Mis(H)) from the Web. (5) If AV and =0andAV or = 0, eliminate V in all QSMCPs and go to step 4. (6) Examine AV and and AV or by the determination rule for contradiction to assign the In order to determine the threshold  X  used in the availability value filtering, we man-ually created 113 Chinese word pairs to simulate critical mismatched segments of TH pairs. These simulated mismatch segments, including 48 contradictive pairs and other non-contradictive pairs, were used to generate sample MCPs. Thereafter, we applied MCP-based Web queries on these sample MCPs, and the contradiction detection accu-racy on these simulated sample MCPs was optimized by tuning the value of threshold  X  . The optimized threshold  X  is applied in the following MCP experiments.
We found that while the threshold  X  was set at 5  X  10  X  15 , the recall, precision, and F -score of contradiction detection on these simulated mismatch pairs achieved a maximum of 70.83% (34/48), 72.34% (34/47), and 71.57% respectively. Table III shows examples of the simulated mismatch segments pairs, their part of speech tags, and the contradictiveness. The architecture of our baseline RTE system [Shih et al. 2011], as shown in Figure 1, is introduced in this section. The key points of the system, includes preprocessing, entailment determination, and result integrating strategy are intro-duced below. Three preprocessing steps are required before the TH pair judgment. These prepro-cesses, which include normalization of temporal and numerical expressions, named en-tity recognition, and co-reference resolution, are designed for reducing the complexity. (1) Normalization of temporal and numerical expressions. The variations of temporal (2) Named entity recognition. In our RITE participating system, we developed two (3) Coreference and Zero-Pernoun resolution. Coreference resolution is defined as Features such as NE, mismatch tokens, head-modifier word pairs, and sentence length are used independently to determine the relation of TH pairs. (1) Named entities. We set a rule that in TH pair, a sentence with more NE means (2) Mismatch tokens. We use the CKIP Chinese segmentation tool [Ma and Chen Algorithm 1. Head-modifier word pair based textual entailment recognition (3) Head-modifier word pair. CKIP Chinese parser [You and Chen 2004] is used to (4) Sentence length. Sentence length is a powerful feature in the RITE dataset. Assume N T and N H represent the token number of T and H respectively, then the relation of sentence length module R T , H is as follows.
 We integrate the results from different features by a voting strategy. The relation with the most feature supports wins the integration. Furthermore, various heuristics are used as tie-breakers to deal with TH pairs with relations of more than one winner. We designed two different experiments to estimate the effectiveness of MCP querying for contradiction detection. First, a TE corpus with manually annotated mismatch information was used to evaluate how well the system detects contradiction in real TE data. Second, we tested our MCP-based contradiction detection system on two different RITE datasets to estimate its impact on the performance of our previous RTE system. This experiment was designed to observe the impact of failed critical mismatched recognition on our MCP-based system X  X  performance using a real TE dataset. First, we manually constructed a TE corpus in which all critical mismatches in TH pairs were annotated. Our annotators checked 421 TH pairs in RITE TC MC development set and labeled both critical mismatches and the verb in the selected 82 TH pairs. For instance, the mismatch segments and the related verb of Example (2) and (3) are manually annotated as  X   X   X   X  (obtain),  X  18  X   X  (18),  X  58  X   X  (58) and  X   X   X   X  (India),  X   X   X   X (oldenemy), X   X  X  X  X   X  (good friend). Secondly, we developed a critical mismatch extraction module that uses the CKIP Chinese parser [You and Chen 2004] to obtain the grammatical dependences among all the tokens in T and H. We checked all to-kens T T from T and t H from H to see if both t T and t H referred to a common token ct
T , H . All token pairs (t T can be regarded as critical mismatch segments between T and H. MCP-based contra-diction detection was carried out on these selected TH pairs, and the results of using manually annotated critical mismatch information were compared to the results with automatically extracted mismatches. The evaluation results are shown in Table V. In this experiment, we examined the impact on performance by adding MCP-based contradiction detection to our NTCIR-9 TE system. According to Shima et al. [2011], the RITE TC development set was mostly created from the NTCIR-7 CCLQA dataset, whereas the RITE TC test set was created from two different sources: the NTCIR-8 CCLQA answer set and the relevant documents retrieved in the past NTCIR CLIR tasks. We use these two different datasets to measure the effectiveness of the MCP-based approach on contradiction detection. A classifier which is based on a Chinese parser was implemented to filter out TH pairs with multiple, complicated mismatches. Tables VI and VII present the comparison between the baseline system and the im-proved system (baseline + contradiction detection) on both RITE TC development sets and test sets.

MCP-based approach yields large contradiction detection improvement in both de-velopment and test data, especially on recall. It may indicate that some implicit in-compatibilities in TH pairs were successfully indentified by our approach. The coverage of our MCP-based contradiction detection approach on different linguis-tic phenomena is examined in this experiment. Two configurations of contradiction detection, including baseline system and the improved system (baseline + contradic-tion detection), are applied on all the categorized contradictive TH pairs in Table I. The comparison of these two contradiction detection system on different linguistic phenom-ena is shown in Table VIII. Based on the MCP-based contradiction detection, most of the background knowledge shortage problems are solved. For instance, the conflicts between  X   X  X  X   X  (concerned) and  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X  (unconcerned),  X   X  X  X   X  (swell) and  X   X  X  X   X  (tighten),  X   X  X  X   X  (together) and  X   X  X   X  (individually) can be correctly identified by our approach. However, three issues are worth noticing. These three issues of potential exceptionable web contents, zero-hit MCPs, and critical extractions of mismatches, are discussed in this section, in addition to some interesting findings. Four kinds of exceptionable Web contents decrease the performance of MCP-based contradiction detection. (1) Mismatch segments with similar but not identical meaning . If the AV of an OR (2) Intended uncommon word usage . Similar detection mistakes happen to strange (3) Oxymoron statement . The MCPs of some antonym pairs, such as  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  (4) Misaligned Chinese word segmentation . The misaligned Chinese word segmenta-Zero-hit MCPs are phrases for which both MCP and and MCP or fail to get any matched results from search engine. We have observed that such MCPs often contain synonyms, unrelated words, or complicated statements. Unexpected zero-hit MCPs severely re-duce the performance of MCP-based contradiction detection, especially on system re-call. We propose two reasons for the occurrence of unexpected zero-hit MCPs. (1) MCP with long mismatches. As the length of an MCP and/or the mismatches (2) MCPs with atypical syntax. Automatically generated MCPs with atypical syntax From the results of Experiment 1, we can see the influence of mismatch extraction error to MCP-based contradiction. Our token-dependency based extraction process achieves an acceptable result in identifying critical mismatches between TH pairs. But there is still more than 20% room in the F -score for improvement. Our present MCP-based contradiction detection system is limited to TH pairs with only one mismatch. In fact, a large number of TH pairs in RITE have more than one mismatch. However, since most mismatches in TH pairs are irrelevant (synonyms, function words, and appositions), before increasing the number of mismatches our system can handle, we have to design a way of filtering out irrelevant mismatches. We found that a large number of the false positive cases in both perfect or extracted mismatch configuration can be correctly identified by slightly shifting the threshold  X  . This fact may indicate that the threshold value which is optimized to the simulated mismatch segments pairs in Section 4.4 is not suitable for real TE data. Also, despite the difficulty of acquiring resources with annotated contradictive statements, these finding points to a future research direction of using large corpora or Web content as bases to determine a more fitting threshold for MCP-based contradiction detection. (1) According to the results of all the tests, we did not observe significant accuracy (2) Both traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese Web pages can be used to compute (3) Although the proposed approach and the experiments are only applied in Chinese, Using Web mining for deriving information and knowledge is common in natural lan-guage processing. But few previous works apply Web mining to obtain the required background knowledge for contradiction detection in the textual entailment frame-work. The mismatched conjunction phrases, which consist of critical mismatches in TH pairs, provide a novel methodology for acquiring implicit knowledge from the Web, and have been proven to be a reliable feature reflecting the existence of incompatibil-ities between two sentences. In addition, by using Web-based checking, the shortage of background knowledge between words or phrases in entailment and contradiction judgment may receive a strong supplement.

Our work can be considered pioneering in the use of Web content for dealing with the problems of textual entailment and contradiction detection. However, the need of extended work and enhancements are addressed in the discussion section. We hope the points we emphasize in this paper can offer some interesting and useful points to contradiction detection researchers and, more generally, text understanding.
