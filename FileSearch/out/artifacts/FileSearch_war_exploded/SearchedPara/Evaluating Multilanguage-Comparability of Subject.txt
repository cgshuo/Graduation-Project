 The field of NLP has seen a recent surge in the amount of research on subjectivity analysis. Along with its applications to various NLP tasks, there have been efforts made to extend the resources and tools created for the English language to other languages. These endeavors have been success-ful in constructing lexicons, annotated corpora, and tools for subjectivity analysis in multiple lan-guages.

There are multilingual subjectivity analysis sys-tems available that have been built to monitor and analyze various concerns and opinions on the In-ternet; among the better known are OASYS from the University of Maryland that analyzes opinions on topics from news article searches in multiple languages (Cesarano et al., 2007) 1 and TextMap, an entity search engine developed by Stony Brook University for sentiment analysis along with other functionalities (Bautin et al., 2008). 2 Though these systems currently rely on English analysis tools and a machine translation (MT) technology to translate other languages into English, up-to-date research provides various ways to analyze subjec-tivity in multilingual environments.

Given sentiment analysis systems in differ-ent languages, there are many situations when the analysis outcomes need to be multilanguage-comparable. For example, it has been common these days for the Internet users across the world to share their views and opinions on various top-ics including music, books, movies, and global af-fairs and incidents, and also multinational compa-nies such as Apple and Samsung need to analyze customer feedbacks for their products and services from many countries in different languages. Gov-ernments may also be interested in monitoring ter-rorist web forums or its global reputation. Sur-veying these opinions and sentiments in various languages involves merging the analysis outcomes into a single database, thereby objectively compar-ing the result across languages.

If there exists an ideal subjectivity analy-sis system for each language, evaluating the multilanguage-comparability would be unneces-sary because the analysis in each language would correctly identify the exact meanings of all in-put texts regardless of the language. However, this requirement is not fulfilled with current technol-ogy, thus the need for defining and measuring the multilanguage-comparability of subjectivity anal-ysis systems is evident.

This paper proposes to evaluate the multilanguage-comparability of multilingual subjectivity analysis systems. We build a number of subjectivity classifiers that distinguishes sub-jective texts from objective ones, and measure the multilanguage-comparability according to our proposed evaluation method. Since subjectivity analysis tools in languages other than English are not readily available, we focus our experiments on comparing different methods to build multilingual analysis systems from the resources and systems created for English. These approaches enable us to extend a monolingual system to many languages with a number of freely available NLP resources and tools. Much research have been put into developing methods for multilingual subjectivity analysis re-cently. With the high availability of subjectivity re-sources and tools in English, an easy and straight-forward approach would be to employ a machine translation (MT) system to translate input texts in target languages into English then carry out the analyses using an existing subjectivity analy-sis tool (Kim and Hovy, 2006; Bautin et al., 2008; Banea et al., 2008). Mihalcea et al. (2007) and Banea et al. (2008) proposed a number of ap-proaches exploiting a bilingual dictionary, a paral-lel corpus, and an MT system to port the resources and systems available in English to languages with limited resources.

For subjectivity lexicons translation, Mihalcea et al. (2007) and Wan (2008) used the first sense in a bilingual dictionary, Kim and Hovy (2006) used a parallel corpus and a word alignment tool to ex-tract translation pairs, and Kim et al. (2009) used a dictionary to translate and a link analysis algo-rithm to refine the matching intensity.

To overcome the shortcomings of available re-sources and to take advantage of ensemble sys-tems, Wan (2008) and Wan (2009) explored meth-ods for developing a hybrid system for Chinese us-ing English and Chinese sentiment analyzers. Ab-basi et al. (2008) and Boiy and Moens (2009) have created manually annotated gold standards in tar-get languages and studied various feature selec-tion and learning techniques in machine learning approaches to analyze sentiments in multilingual web documents.

For learning multilingual subjectivity, the lit-erature tentatively concludes that translating lex-icon is less dependable in terms of preserving sub-jectivity than corpus translation (Mihalcea et al., 2007; Wan, 2008), and though corpus translation results in modest performance degradation, it pro-vides a viable approach because no manual la-bor is required (Banea et al., 2008; Brooke et al., 2009).

Based on the observation that the performances of subjectivity analysis systems in comparable experimental settings for two languages differ, Figure 1: Examples of sentiments in multilingual text Banea et al. (2008) have attributed the variations in the difficulty level of subjectivity learning to the differences in language construction. Bautin et al. (2008) X  X  system analyzes the sentiment scores of entities in multilingual news and blogs and ad-justed the sentiment scores using entity sentiment probabilities of languages. 3.1 Motivation The quality of a subjectivity analysis tool is mea-sured by its ability to distinguish subjectivity from objectivity and/or positive sentiments from nega-tive sentiments. Additionally, a multilingual sub-jectivity analysis system is required to generate unbiased analysis results across languages; the system should base its outcome solely on the sub-jective meanings of input texts irrespective of the language, and the equalities and inequalities of subjectivity labels and intensities must be useful within and throughout the languages.

Let us consider two cases where the pairs of multilingual inputs in English and Korean have identical and different subjectivity meanings (Fig-ure 1). The first pair of texts carry a negative sen-timent about how the release of a new electronics device might affect an emerging business market. When a multilanguage-comparable system is in-putted with such a pair, its output should appropri-ately reflect the negative sentiment, and be identi-cal for both texts. The second pair of texts share a similar positive sentiment about a mobile de-vice X  X  battery capacity but with different strengths. A good multilingual system must be able to iden-tify the positive sentiments and distinguish the dif-ferences in their intensities.

However, these kinds of conditions cannot be measured with performance evaluations indepen-dently carried out on each language; A system with a dissimilar ability to analyze subjective ex-pressions from one language to another may de-liver opposite labels or biased scores on texts with an identical subjective meaning, and vice versa, but still might produce similar performances on the evaluation data.

Macro evaluations on individual languages can-not provide any conclusions on the system X  X  multilanguage-comparability capability. To mea-sure how much of a system X  X  judgment principles are preserved across languages, an evaluation from a different perspective is necessary. 3.2 Evaluation Approach An evaluation of multilanguage-comparability may be done in two ways: measuring agreements in the outcomes of a pair of multilingual texts with an identical subjective meaning, or measuring the consistencies in the label and/or accordance in the order of intensity of a pair of texts with different subjectivities.

There are advantages and disadvantages to each approaches. The first approach requires multi-lingual texts aligned at the level of specificity, for instance, document, sentence and phrase, that the subjectivity analysis system works. Text cor-pora for MT evaluation such as newspapers, books, technical manuals, and government offi-cial records provide a wide variety of parallel texts, typically at the sentence level. Annotating these types of corpus can be efficient; as par-allel texts must have identical semantic mean-ings, subjectivity X  X elated annotations for one lan-guage can be projected into other languages with-out much loss of accuracy.

The latter approach accepts any pair of multi-lingual texts as long as they are annotated with la-bels and/or intensity. In this case, evaluating the la-bel consistency of a multilingual system is only as difficult as evaluating that of a monolingual sys-tem; we can produce all possible pairs of texts from test corpora annotated with labels for each language. Evaluating with intensity is not easy for the latter approach; if test corpora already exist with intensity annotations for both languages, nor-malizing the intensity scores to a comparable scale is necessary (yet is uncertain unless every pair is checked manually), otherwise every pair of mul-tilingual texts needs a manual annotation with its relative order of intensity.

In this paper, we utilize the first approach be-cause it provides a more rational means; we can reasonably hypothesize that text translated into an-other language by a skilled translator carries an identical semantic meaning and thereby conveys identical subjectivity. Therefore the required re-source is more easily attained in relatively inex-pensive ways.

For evaluation, we measure the consistency in the subjectivity labels and the correlation of sub-jectivity intensity scores of parallel texts. Section 5.1 describes the details of evaluation metrics. We create a number of multilingual systems con-sisting of multiple subsystems each processing a language, where one system analyzes English, and the other systems analyze the Korean, Chinese, and Japanese languages. We try to reproduce a set of systems using diverse methods in order to com-pare the systems and find out which methods are more suitable for multilanguage-comparability. 4.1 Source Language System We adopt the three systems described below as our source language systems: a state-of-the-art sub-jectivity classifier, a corpus-based, and a lexicon-based systems. The resources needed for devel-oping the systems or the system itself are readily available for research purposes. In addition, these systems cover the general spectrum of current ap-proaches to subjectivity analysis.
 State-of-the-art (S-SA) : OpinionFinder is a publicly-available NLP tool for subjectivity analy-sis (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Wilson et al., 2005). 3 The software and its resources have been widely used in the field of subjectivity analysis, and it has been the de facto standard system against which new systems are validated. We use a high-coverage classifier from the OpinionFinder X  X  two sentence-level subjectivity classifiers. This Naive Bayes classifier builds upon a corpus annotated by a high-precision classifier with the bootstrapping of the corpus and extraction patterns. The classi-fier assesses a sentence X  X  subjectivity with a label and a score for confidence in its judgment.
 Corpus-based (S-CB) : The MPQA opinion cor-pus is a collection of 535 newspaper articles in En-glish annotated with opinions and private states at the sub-sentence level (Wiebe et al., 2003). 4 We retrieve the sentence level subjectivity labels for 11,111 sentences using the set of rules described in (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005). The corpus provides a relatively balanced corpus with 55% subjective sentences. We train an ML-based classifier us-ing the corpus. Previous studies have found that, among several ML-based approaches, the SVM classifier generally performs well in many subjec-tivity analysis tasks (Pang et al., 2002; Banea et al., 2008).

We use SVM Light with its default configura-tions, 5 inputted with a sentence represented as a feature vector of word unigrams and their counts in the sentence. An SVM score (a margin or the distance from a learned decision boundary) with a positive value predicts the input as being subjec-tive, and negative value as objective.
 Lexicon-based (S-LB) : OpinionFinder contains a list of English subjectivity clue words with in-tensity labels (Wilson et al., 2005). The lexicon is compiled from several manually and automati-cally built resources and contains 6885 unique en-tries.

Riloff and Wiebe (2003) constructed a high-precision classifier for contiguous sentences us-ing the number of strong and weak subjective words in current and nearby sentences. Unlike pre-vious work, we do not (or rather, cannot) main-tain assumptions about the proximity of input text. Using the lexicon, we build a simple and high-coverage rule-based subjectivity classifier. Setting the scores of strong and weak subjective words as 1.0 and 0.5, we evaluate the subjectivity of a given sentence as the sum of subjectivity scores; above a threshold, the input is subjective, and otherwise objective. The threshold value is optimized for an F-measure using the MPQA corpus, and is set to 1 . 0 throughout our experiments. 4.2 Target Language System To construct a target language system leveraging on available resources in the source language, we consider three approaches from previous litera-ture: 1. translating test sentences in target language 2. translating a source language training corpus 3. translating a subjectivity lexicon from source
Each approach has its advantages and disadvan-tages. The advantage of the first approach is its simple architecture, clear separation of subjectiv-ity and MT systems, and that it has only one sub-jectivity system, and is thus easier to maintain. Its disadvantage is that the time-consuming MT has to be executed for each text input. In the sec-ond and third approaches, a subjectivity system in the target language is constructed sharing corpora, rules, and/or features with the source language system. Later on, it may also include its own set of resources specifically engineered for the target language as a performance improvement. How-ever, keeping the systems up-to-date would require as much effort as the number of languages. All three approaches use MT, and would suffer sig-nificantly if the translation results are poor.
Using the first approach, we can easily adopt all three source language systems;  X  Target input translated into source, analyzed  X  Target input translated into source, analyzed  X  Target input translated into source, analyzed
The second and the third approaches are carried out as follows: Corpus-based (T-CB) : We translate the MPQA corpus into the target languages sentence by sen-tence using a web-based service. 6 Using the same method for S-CB , we train an SVM model for each language with the translated training corpora. Lexicon-based (T-LB) : This classifier is identi-cal to S-LB , where the English lexicon is replaced by one of the target languages. We automatically translate the lexicon using free bilingual dictionar-ies. 7 First, the entries in the lexicon are looked Table 1: Agreement on subjectivity (S for subjec-tive, O objective) of 859 sentence chunks in Ko-rean between two annotators (An. 1 and An. 2). up in the dictionary, if they are found, we se-lect the first word in the first sense of the def-inition. If the entry is not in the dictionary, we lemmatize it, 8 then repeat the search. Our sim-ple approach produces moderate-sized lexicons (3,808, 3,980, 3,027 for Korean, Chinese, and Japanese) compared to Mihalcea et al. (2007) X  X  complicated translation approach (4,983 Roma-nian words). The threshold values are optimized using the MPQA corpus translated into each tar-get language. 9 5.1 Experimental Setup Test Corpus
Our evaluation corpus consists of 50 parallel newspaper articles from the Donga Daily News Website. 10 The website provides news articles in Korean and their human translations in English, Japanese, and Chinese. We selected articles that contain Editorial in its English title from a 30-day period. Three human annotators who are flu-ent in the two languages manually annotated N-to-N sentence alignments for each language pairs (KR-EN, KR-CH, KR-JP). By keeping only the sentence chunks whose Korean chunk appears in all language pairs, we were left with 859 sentence chunk pairs.

The corpus was preprocessed with NLP tools for each language, 11 and the Korean, Chinese, and Japanese texts were translated into English with the same web-based service used to translate the training corpus in Section 4.2.
 Manual Annotation and Agreement Study Table 2: Agreement on projection of subjectivity (S for subjective, O objective) from Korean (KR) to English (EN) by one annotator.

To assess the performance of our subjectiv-ity analysis systems, the Korean sentence chunks were manually annotated by two native speakers of Korean with Subjective and Objective labels (Table 1). A proportion agreement of 0.86 and a kappa value of 0.73 indicate a substantial agree-ment between the two annotators. We set aside 743 sentence chunks that both annotators agreed on for the automatic evaluation of subjectivity analysis systems, thereby removing the borderline cases, which are difficult even for humans to as-sess. The corresponding sentence chunks for other languages were extracted and tagged with labels equivalent to Korean chunks.

In addition, to verify how consistently the sub-jectivity of the original texts is projected to the translated, we carried out another manual annota-tion and agreement study with Korean and English sentence chunks (Table 2).

Note that our cross-lingual agreement study is similar to the one carried out by Mihalcea et al. (2007), where two annotators labeled the sen-tence subjectivity of a parallel text in different lan-guages. They reported that, similarly to monolin-gual annotations, most cases of disagreements on annotations are due to the differences in the anno-tators X  judgments on subjectivity, and the rest from subjective meanings lost in the translation process and figurative language such as irony.

To avoid the role played by annotators X  pri-vate views from disagreements, the subjectivity of sentence chunks in English were manually anno-tated by one of the annotators for the Korean text. Judged by the same annotator, we speculate that the disagreement in the annotation should account only for the inconsistency in the subjectivity pro-jection. By proportion, the agreement between the annotation of Korean and English is 0.97, and the kappa is 0.96, suggesting an almost perfect agree-ment. Only a small number of sentence chunk pairs have inconsistent labels; six chunks in Ko-Figure 2: Excerpts from Donga Daily News with differing sentiments between parallel texts rean lost subjectivity in translation, and implied subjective meanings in twelve chunks were ex-pressed explicitly through interpretation. Excerpts from our corpus show two such cases (Figure 2). Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the multilanguage-comparability of subjectivity analysis systems, we measure 1) how consistently the system assigns subjectivity labels and 2) how closely numeric scores for systems X  confidences correlate with regard to parallel texts in different languages.

In particular, we use Cohen X  X  kappa coefficient for the first and Pearson X  X  correlation coefficient for the latter. These widely used metrics provide useful comparability measures for categorical and quantitative data.

Both coefficients are scaled from  X  1 to +1 , in-dicating negative to positive correlations. Kappa measures are corrected for chance, thereby yield-ing better measurements than agreement by pro-portion. The characteristics of Pearson X  X  correla-tion coefficient that it measures linear relation-ships and is independent of change in origin, scale, and unit comply with our experiments. 5.2 Subjectivity Classification Our multilingual subjectivity analysis systems were evaluated on the test corpora described in Section 5.1 (Table 3).

Due to the difference in testbeds, the perfor-mance of the state-of-the-art English system ( S-SA ) on our corpus is lower by about 10% rela-tively than the performance reported on the MPQA corpus. 12 However, it still performs sufficiently well and provides the most balanced results among the three source language systems; The corpus-based system ( S-CB ) classifies with a high pre-cision, and the lexicon-based ( S-LB ) with a high recall. The source language systems ( S-SA,-CB,-LB ) lose a small percentage in precision when in-putted with translations, but the recalls are gener-ally on a par or even higher in the target languages.
For the systems created from target language re-sources, Corpus-based systems ( T-CB ) generally perform better than the ones with source language resource ( S-CB ), and lexicon-based systems ( T-LB ) perform worse than ( S-LB ). Similarly to sys-tems with source language resources, T-CB clas-sifies with a high precision and T-LB with a high recall, but the gap is less. Among the target lan-guages, Korean tends to have a higher precision, and Japanese a higher recall than other languages in most systems.

Overall, S-SA provides easy accessibility when analyzing both the source and the target languages, with a balanced precision and recall performance. Among the other approaches, only T-CB is bet-ter in all measures than S-SA , and S-LB performs best on F-measure evaluations. 5.3 Multilanguage-Comparability The evaluation results on multilanguage-comparability are presented in Table 4. The subjectivity analysis systems are evaluated with all language pairs with kappa and Pearson X  X  correlation coefficients. Kappa and Pearson X  X  correlation values are consistent with each other; Pearson X  X  correlation between the two evaluation measures is 0.91.

We observe a distinct contrast in performances between corpus-based systems ( S-CB and T-CB ) and lexicon-based systems ( S-LB and T-LB ); All corpus-based systems show moderate agreements while agreements on lexicon-based systems are only fair.

Within corpus-based systems, S-CB performs better with language pairs that include English, and T-CB performs better with language pairs of the target languages.

For lexicon-based systems, systems in the tar-get languages ( T-LB ) performs the worst with only slight to fair agreements between languages. Lexicon-based systems and state-of-the-art sys-tems in the source language ( S-LB and S-SA ) re-sult in average performances. tions of the target languages into English.
 S-SA 71.1 63.5 67.1 70.7 61.1 65.6 67.3 68.8 68.0 69.1 67.5 68.3 S-CB 74.4 53.9 62.5 74.5 52.2 61.4 71.1 63.3 67.0 72.9 65.3 68.9 S-LB 62.5 87.7 73.0 62.9 87.7 73.3 59.9 91.5 72.4 61.8 94.1 74.6 T-CB 72.4 67.5 69.8 75.0 66.2 70.3 72.5 70.3 71.4 T-LB 59.4 71.0 64.7 58.4 82.3 68.2 56.9 92.4 70.4 lines in figures are best-fit lines through the origins.
Figure 3 shows scatter plots of subjectivity scores of our English and Korean test corpora eval-uated on different systems; the data points on the first and the third quadrants are occurrences of la-bel agreements, and the second and the fourth are disagreements. Linearly scattered data points are more correlated regardless of the slope.

Figure 3a shows a moderate correlation for mul-tilingual results from the state-of-the-art system ( S-SA ). Agreements on objective instances are clustered together while agreements on subjective instances are diffused over a wide region.

Agreements between the source language corpus-based system ( S-CB ) and the corpus-based system trained with translated resources ( T-CB ) are more distinctively correlated than the results for other pairs of systems (Figures 3b and 3d). We notice that S-CB seems to have a lower number of outliers than T-CB , but slightly more diffusive.
Lexicon-based systems ( S-LB , T-LB ) gener-ate noticeably uncorrelated scores (Figures 3c and 3e). We observe that the results from the English system with translated inputs ( S-LB ) is more cor-related than those from systems with translated lexicons ( T-LB ), and that analysis results from both systems are biased toward subjective scores. Which approach is most suitable for multilingual subjectivity analysis?
In our experiments, the corpus-based sys-tems trained on corpora translated from English to the target languages ( T-CB ) perform well for subjectivity classification and multilanguage-comparability measures on the whole. However, the methods we employed to expand the languages were naively carried out without much considera-tions for optimization. Further adjustments could improve the other systems for both classification and multilanguage-comparability performances. Is there a correlation between classification per-formance and multilanguage-comparability?
Lexicon-based systems in the source language ( S-LB ) have good overall classification perfor-mances, especially on recall and F-measures. However, these systems performs worse on multilanguage-comparability than other systems with poorer classification performances. Intrigued by the observation, we tried to measure which criteria for classification performance influences multilanguage-comparability. We again employed Pearson X  X  correlation metrics to measure the corre-lations of precision (P), recall (R), and F-measures (F) to kappa (  X  ) and Pearson X  X  correlation (  X  ) val-ues.

Specifically, we measure the correlations be-tween the sums of P, the sums of R, and the sums of F to  X  and  X  for all pairs of systems. 13 The correlations of P with  X  and  X  are 0 . 78 and 0 . 68 , R  X  0 . 38 and  X  0 . 28 , and F  X  0 . 20 and  X  0 . 05 . These numbers strongly suggest that multilanguage-comparability correlates with the precisions of classifiers.

However, we cannot always expect a high-precision multilingual subjectivity classifier to be multilanguage-comparable as well. For example, the S-SA system has a much higher precision than S-LB consistently over all languages, but their multilanguage-comparability performances differed only by small amounts. Multilanguage-comparability is an analysis sys-tem X  X  ability to retain its decision criteria across different languages. We implemented a number of previously proposed approaches to learning mul-tilingual subjectivity, and evaluated the systems on multilanguage-comparability as well as clas-sification performance. Our experimental results provide meaningful comparisons of the multilin-gual subjectivity analysis systems across various aspects.

Also, we developed a multilingual subjectivity evaluation corpus from a parallel text, and studied inter-annotator, inter-language agreements on sub-jectivity, and observed persistent subjectivity pro-jections from one language to another from a par-allel text.

For future work, we aim extend this work to constructing a multilingual sentiment analysis sys-tem and evaluate it with multilingual datasets such as product reviews collected from different countries. We also plan to resolve the lexicon-based classifiers X  classification bias towards sub-jective meanings with a list of objective words (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) and their multilin-gual expansion (Kim et al., 2009), and evaluate the multilanguage-comparability of systems con-structed with resources from different sources.
