 Computational creativity, as an emerging domain of application, emphasizes the use of big data to automatically design new knowl-edge. Based on the availability of complex multi-relational data, one aspect of computational creativity is to infer unexplored region-s of feature space and novel learning paradigm, which is particular-ly useful for online recommendation. Tensor models offer effective approaches for complex multi-relational data learning and missing element completion. Targeting at constructing a recommender sys-tem that can compromise between accuracy and creativity for user-s, a deep Bayesian probabilistic tensor framework for tag and item recommending is adopted. Empirical results demonstrate the supe-riority of the proposed method and indicate that it can better capture latent patterns of interaction relationships and generate interesting recommendations based on creative tag combinations.
 recommendation; serendipity; Bayesian tensor factorization Computational creativity, a study on algorithms for computer to generate artifacts that humans perceive to be creative, is a new-ly emerging field in today X  X  e-commerce operations. Colton et al. [4] provide a definition for computational creativity research as:  X  X he philosophy, science and engineering of computational sys-tems exhibit impersonally creative behaviors by taking on partic-ular responsibilities. X  Based on this definition, attempts including automatic culinary recipe generating system [9] have been made through cognitive flavor assessment. For recommendation, diversi-ty also has become an important aspect for evaluation [11], where content-based systems usually suffer from over-specialization, s-ince only items similar to those rated by users will be more likely recommended. Computational creativity is also related to serendip-ity, as defined in [6], a user-oriented measurement balancing be-tween surprise and accuracy. Serendipitous recommendations by definition are also novel. Consider a recommender system that simply recommends movies directed by the user X  X  favorite director, comparing to recommend a movie of the same director that the user Figure 1: CP decomposition: a three mode user-video-tag rela-tional dataset example. The tensor can be expressed in a matrix format: X = {  X ,U (1) ,U (2) ,...,U ( k ) } coupled and nonlinear interactions between entities [13]. Also, they are not robust to datasets containing noisy and missing val-ues. Through proper generative model, nonparametric Bayesian multi-way analysis algorithms are especially appealing, since they provide efficient ways to deal with distinct data types as well as da-ta with missing values and noises. Moreover, since we are expect-ed to recommend items not only considering the accuracy but also the creativity and serendipity, the posterior likelihood of Bayesian model can also be leveraged as a probabilistic ranking generating mechanism. Meanwhile, deep networks prove great empirical suc-cess in various domains [2]. They are capable of providing more compact nonlinear representations for feature learning. It would be interesting to adopt deep learning in one or more of the tensor modes and assess its effectiveness on tensor completion.
In this paper we address the aforementioned challenges through a novel Deep Tensor for Probabilistic Recommendation (DTPR) method. It breaks the task at hand into the following components: 1. a tensor construction stage of building user-item-tag correlation; 2. a tensor decomposition stage learning factors for each compo-nent mode; 3. a stage of tensor completion, which computes the creativity value of tag pairs; and 4. a recommender stage that ranks the candidate items according to both precision and creative con-sideration. This approach is evaluated using a real world video recommender system, with large amount of users, videos and cor-responding video description tags.
For a typical online video recommender system, the first step is to construct a third-order tensor from the video clicking logs; sec-ondly, factoring the tensor using a decomposition method; and then reconstructing the decomposed elements. Following these steps, a three-way tensor, Tag  X  User  X  Video, is then constructed populat-ed with the times of video being clicked by a user (Figure 1). For the factorization part, a Deep Canonical PARAFAC Factorization (DCPF) Model [8] is applied.

Accordingly, the next step is ranking the candidate items for rec-ommendation. To encourage creative recommendation, it includes the consideration of tag pair preferences from the reconstructed ten-sor through introducing Bayesian surprise, which will be further elaborated in the following subsections. The preferences of users to rank the top-N list of item candidates are then probabilistically calculated.
We briefly review the DCPF model discussed in [8]. Let Y de-note an observed incomplete K-order tensor. For different types of observation, a noise function f can be applied on, depending on the data type being modeled [14] (e.g. Gaussian for real-valued da-ta). The parameters of CP decomposition, { U ( k ) } K k =1 , are further represented by lower rank component factor score V ( k ) and factor of each mode factor matrix. The higher weight it is, the more rel-evant user i is related to the topic. Since the goal of our task is not only providing accurate but also creative recommendations, in-stead of solely using the final reconstructed tensor from the model, we propose to rank the result of tensor modeling incorporating the Bayesian surprise value for generating the top-N list of candidate items to the users.

Using the reconstructed tensor  X  Y , for each user u , two candidate lists can be created: (1) a list of items that the user might be in-terested in based on the posterior add-up values of user and item factor matrices; and (2) a list of tag preference pairs based on the normalized maximum values of Bayesian surprise metric. Assume the number of candidate item is n , and the number of tag pairs is J . J can be adjusted depending on how much compromise on cre-ativity the system wishes to make. The score for ranking user-item pair is calculated as follows: Where w = P R r =1  X  r u (1) r u (2) T r is the weight matrix obtained from reconstructed tensor, N j is the number of tag pairs belong-ing to video v , in the top-J surprising list to user u . S is the sur-prise degree matrix of users to tag pairs. Each row vector of the final score matrix is then ranked in descending order, indicating the top-N weighted items as recommendation candidates.
We perform experiments on a large-scale real-word dataset to verify the performance of the DTPR model on expressing high-level semantic features of user behavior and incorporating creativ-ity consideration into recommendation. The real-world records were collected in three consecutive weeks at the same time slot from Tencent QQ browser (http://video.browser.qq.com) in August, 2014. The database stores historical clicking logs of active users extracted from the Hadoop distributed file system, with each record referring to one video clicked. Besides the time slot, user id, video id, number of clicks by this particular user and the total number of clicks in history, there are four categories of information provided as video description tag (in Chinese): (1) type (e.g. action, mys-tery); (2) region (e.g. US, main land China); (3) director; and (4) actor. Based on these information, a three-way User  X  Video  X  Tag tensor is constructed. There are 4 , 071 , 811 samples in total with 137 , 465 unique users, and 9 , 393 unique videos they clicked. The rank of the tensor equals to 140.
Recall that our goal is to automatically generate serendipitous tag combinations for users, it is important to, analyze the tag com-pletion performance part of the proposed method first. If we regard each type of tags as semantic words from different domains, this problem can also be regarded as multi-task clustering. We would like to evaluate how well the system ranks the correct items for each user based on single category and multiple categories of tags. Two metrics are employed for this: (1) the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and (2) Precision at 1 (P @1 ). MRR computes the inverse rank of the correct item and averages the score across the whole data. P at 1 computes the percentage of times the ground truth item are ranked as the top one.

From Table 1, although having high frequency of occurrence, tags from category II  X  X egion X  have the lowest MRR and P @1 method [12], with varying candidates number n ranging from 1-10. The measures are defined as: Precision = N r N , Recall = N r N Averaged hit rate = P evant videos in top-N item candidates, N t is the ground truth of relevant videos that user has watched, r i is the rank of each rele-vant video in the recommender pool. The pair number J is fixed at 5.

As shown in Figure 2, we compare the proposed model in single layer and 2-layer version with and without incorporating Bayesian surprise for item ranking. The increase of pool number will en-hance the probability to recommend the favored video. Thus, the three metrics have the trend of gradually growing. Although sin-gle layer and 2-layer DTPR have similar precision for predicting, a multi-layer implementation allows an obvious higher hit rate, which indicates that it can pick the correct choice of users at an earlier stage of recommendation. Through incorporating Bayesian surprise, the performance does degrade due to the additional un-certainty it introduces to the item ranking. However, it still out-performs both LDA and Tagommender [12] method. Considering the surprise it brings to the users, which will in return enhance user experience, this kind of recommending has its merits in practice.
Given the increasing growth in large-scale multi-relational da-ta, we study the computational creativity problem in video recom-mendation domain. To effectively learn user-item-tag correlations, we utilize deep Bayesian tensor model, which provides an effec-tive way for joint analysis of user and video features. Through a scalable framework for tensor decomposition and completion, and through introducing Bayesian surprise into probabilistic ranking, we are able to recommend personalized items taking creativity as a consideration. Our model can perform fully conjugate Bayesian inference via Gibbs sampling inference. The quantization index, Bayesian surprise, for computational creativity is assessed. Cur-rently the creativity is valuated based on generating new combi-nation of existent items. Creative construction for data from pre-viously unexplored domain based on current knowledge are also appealing for future targets. This research was supported by project B-Q43W, B-Q49B, and G-UA3W.
