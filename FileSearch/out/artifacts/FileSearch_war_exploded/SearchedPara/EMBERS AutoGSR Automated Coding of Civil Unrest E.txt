 We describe the EMBERS AutoGSR system that conducts automated coding of civil unrest events from news articles published in multiple languages. The nuts and bolts of the AutoGSR system constitute an ecosystem of filtering, rank-ing, and recommendation models to determine if an article reports a civil unrest event and, if so, proceed to identify and encode specific characteristics of the civil unrest event such as the when, where, who, and why of the protest. AutoGSR is a deployed system for the past 6 months continually pro-cessing data 24x7 in languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, English and encoding civil unrest events in 10 countries of Latin America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela. We demonstrate the superiority of AutoGSR over both manual approaches and other state-of-the-art encoding systems for civil unrest.
 event extraction, event encoding, text mining
The computational modeling and interpretation of soci-etal events has been a holy grail in social science research. Beginning in the 1980s, there have been significant efforts in computational analysis of societal events supported by government programs such as DARPA X  X  ICEWS (Integrated Conflict Early Warning System) and CIA X  X  PITF (Political Instability Task Force). Projects of similar (and more ambi-tious) scope continues to this day, and offer greater specificity, both spatially and temporally into modeling global events.
We are part of the EMBERS consortium [13] that aims to forecast civil unrest phenomena (protests, strikes, and  X  X c-cupy X  events) in multiple countries of Latin America, specif-ically Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Sal-vador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela. In our earlier KDD 2014 paper [13] we demonstrated how we can use open source indicators such as news, blogs, Twitter, food prices, and economic data, to forecast civil unrest events. Figure 1: The EMBERS system forecasts civil unrest events from open source indicators while the EMBERS AutoGSR system encodes civil unrest events as they are re-ported in newspapers. Output from the AutoGSR system is used to both evaluate EMBERS forecasts and to retrain EMBERS models on a periodic basis.

Hogenboom et. al.[3] provides an overview of different extraction methodologies used by the current state-of-the-art systems. The methodologies used here include statistical as well as linguistic and lexicographical approaches for event extraction. TABARI (Textual Analysis by Augmented Re-placement Instructions) [15] and BBN X  X  SERIF (Statistical Entity and Relation Information Finder) [1, 14] are two state-of-the-art event encoders. These encoders not only extract events but also encode them via a mapping to an event tax-onomy. Such mappings add structure to the extracted event thereby making it feasible to perform systematic studies. CAMEO [16] is one such widely used event taxonomy and is used by both TABARI and SERIF.

TABARI is one of the earlier open source event extraction systems that uses sparse parsing to recognize patterns in are two such systems that analyze hundreds of news sources from all over the world in order to generate a database of events.

ICEWS, which began in 2007, is a DARPA funded project that focuses primarily on monitoring, accessing and forecast-ing events of interests for military commanders. Internally, ICEWS employs TABARI and SERIF to encode news arti-cles. ICEWS focuses primarily on generating high quality, reliable events and uses several mechanisms to filter the raw stream of reported stories into a unique stream of events. Events are encoded in accordance to the CAMEO taxonomy.
GDELT, on the other hand focuses on capturing an exten-sive set of events both in terms of categories and geographical spread. By design, the goal of GDELT is to collect a large number of events without worrying about false positives. Internally, it uses an enhanced version of TABARI and maps events to the CAMEO taxonomy.

Although both these systems are considered state-of-the-art, in our experiments we have found that they perform poorly in comparison to manually generated ground truth data. See Table 1 for examples of erroneous encodings in ICEWS and GDELT. This is primarily because of the fully automated event generation process that yields false positives. Hence, there is a need for a semi-automated system that can generate validated event encodings with minimal human effort. Table 2 contrasts ICEWS and GDELT against our AutoGSR system.
EMBERS AutoGSR is a web based system that generates validated civil unrest events extracted from news articles. The system architecture is shown in Fig. 3.
News articles are collected every day from three data sources: 1) Site specific Google Search 2) RSS feeds sub-scribed to individual news websites, and 3) News databases. Articles are filtered if they contain a protest related keyword. With the help of subject matter experts, we created a list of protest keywords for each language.
This stage of EMBERS AutoGSR is responsible for running and managing the sophisticated models ecosystem , along with performing standard tasks like data cleaning and enrichment.
The fetch and clean component fetches the article from the original web source and performs a boilerplate removal in order to extract the full article text. On this extracted full text, keyword based search is performed once again to make sure that at least one protest related keyword is present in the text. This component also fetches SEO meta tags, if present for each article. (These meta tags are added by news websites in order to improve their search ranking and includes several key information about the article such as publish date, keywords, summary, and description.)
This component enriches news articles by performing vari-ous kinds of linguistic processing. The enrichment comprises named entity extraction, lemmatization, location identifica-tion, geo-reference resolution, and translation of article text rules that perform a hard classification into protest or non protest. The models are applied in a series, where if the article fails one of the models, the article is classified as a non protest article. When an article successfully passes all the filtering models, it is processed through the subsequent ranking and recommendation models.
 other and assign a probability score for classifying the article as a protest article. The individual probability scores gener-ated by each model are fed to an ensembler which generates a representative ensembled probability score for the article. The accuracy of individual models in the past is also used as an input by the ensembler.
 assume that the article is a protest article and based on this assumption extracts &amp; recommends both full event en-coding(s) and individual encoding components. Elaborating on what was mentioned earlier, a full event encoding com-prises of the following components: 1) protest location, 2) protest date, 3) participating population group, 4) reason for protest, 5) violent or peaceful protest, and 6) protest reported date. These models work in tandem to generate the full event encoding. If there are multiple models generating recommendations for a particular encoding component then an ensembler is used to determine a representative value.
The output of the data processing component containing clean, enriched news articles along with the individual and ensembled values generated by the model ecosystem is stored in a database. This database acts as the primary data source for the AutoGSR Web Interface which displays news articles along with the associated data. For each article, the database also stores validated encoding results generated by the manual validation process.
The web interface shown in Fig. 4 displays enriched news articles; output from the models ecosystem ; and controls to validate recommended encodings. More specifically the interface displays the following (the numerical labeling of the components in the image corresponds with the list numbers below): 1. Allows the user to specify the filtering criteria for dis-2. The articles satisfying the filtering criteria are clustered Table 6: Quality and Coverage Evaluation for AutoGSR vs Manual GSR*. *In October no manual GSR was generated for Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela. Hence, we are unable to evaluate AutoGSR X  X  performance 2015, Nov 2015, and Dec 2015. Here recall corresponds to the number of events identified by the GSR that were also identified by AutoGSR; and precision corresponds to the number of events identified by AutoGSR that were also found in the GSR. As the results in Table 6 demonstrate, the AutoGSR system has a near perfect precision and recall, thereby indicating that the system identified almost all civil unrest events reported by the GSR while maintaining a really low false positive rate. Further, for these identified events, the quality of the extracted encodings is very close to the true GSR encodings.

Brazil is the only country which appears to have a high false positive rate which can be attributed to an incorrectly added news source. Globo is a big media conglomerate in Brazil that owns newspapers, news channels, and online real time news portals. While MITRE focuses only on the electronic version of the print newspaper ( oglobo.globo.com ), the AutoGSR system was fetching articles from *.globo.com . These also included articles from the real time news portal g1.globo.com which reports events in real time without much verification. Hence, we identified several more protests be-cause the evolving news stories were considered as different events. This is also corroborated by the fact that many of the g1.globo.com links are dead or have a short life span as links pointing to intermittent stories are removed once all the details about an event are known. Interestingly, Brazil has the highest Quality Score with a perfect recall pointing to the fact that all the events reported by GSR were still correctly identified by AutoGSR, and with very high quality. These extraneous sub domains were removed from the system in mid January 2016.
We evaluate both objectively and subjectively the reduc-tion in manual effort. The objective evaluation is performed by comparing total resource hours required to generate GSR and AutoGSR, while subjective evaluation is done by sur-veying MITRE X  X  analysts.

Tables 8 and 9 list the number of hours used by analysts to generate GSR and AutoGSR events. Table 10 shows minimum and maximum number of resource hours required per week by GSR and AutoGSR teams. The table also lists reduction figures. AutoGSR achieves an average reduction of 71-72% in manual effort.

In order to develop intuition behind this reduction in man-ual efforts, we surveyed the analysts from the MITRE team. Table 8: Resource Distribution for GSR between GSR and AutoGSR and Figure 7b compares the weekly time series for all the four systems.
We have presented AutoGSR, an automated event coding system for civil unrest events that is now in full continuous production use. In addition to developing and deploying the system, we have undertaken an entire life cycle analysis of how such a system would fit in an analyst X  X  pipeline, with a view to quantify benefits over a purely manual approach. The results from our deployment indicate that the performance measures obtained by AutoGSR are compelling to support their continued use in an event modeling setting. Future work is now focused on expanding the scope of AutoGSR to new regions of the world, and to new classes of events, beyond civil unrest.
