Alison Cawsey passed away in June 2009. She was a remarkable person and her death is a profound professional and personal loss. Born in 1963, Alison grew up in the south of England and, from 1981 to 1984, studied Natural Sciences at Jesus College
Cambridge. During this period she met her life partner Richard. Alison always excelled academically but not always in the sporting arena; however, at Cambridge, like her dad, she finally found a sport she could sit down to: She took up rowing!

Masters in Knowledge Based Systems in 1986, and a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence in 1989. Subsequently, she went on to carry out postdoctoral research at Cambridge and Glasgow, then teaching Computing at Glasgow before joining us at Heriot-Watt in 1995.

Janet Hitzeman, best known for her work on temporal expressions, corpora, discourse, and information extraction, passed away on 18 May, aged 46, after a long struggle with illness. She was one of the funniest and most generous members of our community, and will be greatly missed.
 joring in Math and Computer Science at UC Davis in 1984, she went on to get an MSc in Computer Science at USC, where she got interested in NLP particularly through the influence of Yigal Arens. After graduating she joined the AI group at Hughes Aircraft in Los Angeles, working on NLP, and spent a few fun years in LA that provided the material for many of her best-known stories (including  X  X he Superglue Incident X ). She then took the plunge and moved East, with the aim of getting a Ph.D. in Linguistics.
In 1988 she moved to Rochester, NY, as part of the first group of Ph.D. students of the recently reformed Ph.D. program, led by Greg Carlson, who became her advisor.
Science, Linguistics, and Psychology departments formed a closely knit Cognitive Sci-ence community in which the intellectual exchange between areas was encouraged.
Janet followed classes and graduate seminars with James Allen and Mike Tanenhaus, and was TA for Len Schubert, just like we students in CS followed graduate seminars with Sandro Zucchi, Peter Lasersohn, and Tom Bever. Janet X  X  classmates and friends included Derek Gross, Graham Katz, Julie Sedivy, Beverly Spejevsky, Becca Webb, and
Roberto Zamparelli in Linguistics; Peter Heeman, Marc Light, David Traum, and one of us (Massimo Poesio) among the NLP students in CS, as well as students of Dana
Ballard such as Polly Pook. Social life and intellectual life mixed in events like pasta at Tom Bever X  X  after the seminar. During this period she also began her collaboration and friendship with Greg Whittemore, then at Kodak, that was to continue later in
Edinburgh. 476 in general, as her area of interest X  X n area that would remain the main focus of her research throughout her career. She went through her Ph.D. career very quickly, the first among her Linguistics colleagues to pass quals, the first to publish a paper at a major linguistics conference (Hitzeman 1991), and the first to graduate, in 1993, with a dissertation on  X  X emporal Adverbials and the Syntax-Semantics Interface X  in which she proposed that the alternative interpretations of temporal adverbials like for could actually be derived from information structure without the need to stipulate an ambiguity (Hitzeman 1997).

The snow didn X  X  change Marc X  X  mind, and Janet spent six years in Edinburgh, continu-ing her work on temporal expressions but also starting research in new areas including discourse, natural language generation, and prosody. Her work on temporal expression interpretation led to her most cited article (Hitzeman, Moens, and Grover 1995), also included in The Language of Time , the recent collection of classics in temporal expression interpretation edited by Mani et al. (Mani, Pustejovsky, and Gaizauskas 2005). Her work on the ILEX NLG project (Hitzeman, Mellish, and Oberlander 1997) resulted instead in her getting interested in discourse, in particular the effect of local and global salience on the interpretation of anaphoric expressions (Hitzeman and Poesio 1998; Poesio et al. 2004). This research was grounded in empirical data resulting from an annotation effort that Janet started and that was to lead eventually to the creation of the GNOME corpus.
She also became interested in the relation between discourse structure and prosody, getting involved in one of the first projects attempting to use discourse information to improve speech synthesis (Hitzeman et al. 1998). Finally, she became a key element of the social life at the Human Communication Research Centre, which had at its heart the

 schemes, and was happiest when up close to the linguistic data, especially non-garden-variety corpora such as financial filings, disease-tracking e-mails, chat room logs, blogs, and so forth. In her early years at MITRE Janet contributed to work on developing event extraction systems, working largely with rule-based mechanisms that exploited her understanding and interests in how language could express information of relevance to various tasks. A hallmark of her work was the close interaction of annotated corpus development and the design of heuristics grounded in that data. She contributed to the early versions of standards like TimeML, and was a key figure behind the development of SpatialML.

Among the best known papers resulting from Janet X  X  work on information extraction while at MITRE are Mani et al. (2008) on SpatialML and Wellner et al. (2007) on de-identification. At the time of her death, Janet was in her second year as principal investigator of a project developing a prototype to monitor World Health Organization disease outbreak announcements.
This system was able to exploit the unique aspects of this  X  X icro-genre X  to achieve very high levels of accuracy in automatically recognizing and mapping disease outbreak information with Google Earth (Hitzeman 2008). Janet also got involved in research on using dialogue for collaborative learning, in cooperation with Brad Goodman and colleagues (Goodman et al. 2005). Last but not least, she developed large portions of hand-annotated corpora still used to pursue research of various kinds: In addition to the
SpatialML data, she was the key annotator for the cross-document coreference annota-tion corpus developed for the 2007 Johns Hopkins Summer Workshop on coreference resolution (Day et al. 2008).

 and at summer schools like ESSLLI, and was popular with everybody in the community.
This was because she was incredibly warm and always had a charming interest in what people were up to, in research and in personal life. An additional reason for her popularity was that she was a great storyteller and a great listener. Her e-mails were always eagerly received as they would always contain consistently funny accounts of her encounters with Superglue, dogs, or camels. In a word, she was a great source of joy for all of us.

In parsing, he extended the GLR parsing algorithm to incorporate probabilities, multiple connection tables, and simultaneously carry out morphological and syntactic analysis for non-segmenting languages such as Japanese (Tanaka, Tokunaga, and Aizawa 1993; Inui et al. 1997; Shirai et al. 2000). His research on semantic analysis covered a broad spectrum, encompassing word sense disambiguation (Fujii et al. 1998), spoken language understanding for virtual agent systems (Shinyama,
Tokunaga, and Tanaka 2000), lexical semantic approaches to query expansion in in-formation retrieval (Mandala, Tokunaga, and Tanaka 2000), and metaphor processing (Iwayama, Tokunaga, and Tanaka 1990). He also carried out research on machine trans-lation (Tanaka, Isahara, and Yasuhara 1983; Tanaka 1999b; Baldwin and Tanaka 2000), computer-assisted language learning (Bilac, Baldwin, and Tanaka 2002), speech recog-nition (Itou, Hayamizu, and Tanaka 1992; Li, Tanaka, and Tokunaga 1995), dialogue sys-tems (Akiba and Tanaka 1994; Funakoshi, Tokunaga, and Tanaka 2002), and automatic music generation (Suzuki, Tokunaga, and Tanaka 1999). He was the author or editor of a number of popular introductory texts on NLP in Japanese (Tanaka 1989, 1999a).
Machine Translation Project (1987 X 1995) between East and South-East Asian languages (Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Indonesian, and Malay). He also initiated a project on lan-guage resources for Asian languages which was funded by the Japanese Ministry of

Janet Hitzeman, best known for her work on temporal expressions, corpora, discourse, and information extraction, passed away on 18 May, aged 46, after a long struggle with illness. She was one of the funniest and most generous members of our community, and will be greatly missed.
 joring in Math and Computer Science at UC Davis in 1984, she went on to get an MSc in Computer Science at USC, where she got interested in NLP particularly through the influence of Yigal Arens. After graduating she joined the AI group at Hughes Aircraft in Los Angeles, working on NLP, and spent a few fun years in LA that provided the material for many of her best-known stories (including  X  X he Superglue Incident X ). She then took the plunge and moved East, with the aim of getting a Ph.D. in Linguistics.
In 1988 she moved to Rochester, NY, as part of the first group of Ph.D. students of the recently reformed Ph.D. program, led by Greg Carlson, who became her advisor.
Science, Linguistics, and Psychology departments formed a closely knit Cognitive Sci-ence community in which the intellectual exchange between areas was encouraged.
Janet followed classes and graduate seminars with James Allen and Mike Tanenhaus, and was TA for Len Schubert, just like we students in CS followed graduate seminars with Sandro Zucchi, Peter Lasersohn, and Tom Bever. Janet X  X  classmates and friends included Derek Gross, Graham Katz, Julie Sedivy, Beverly Spejevsky, Becca Webb, and
Roberto Zamparelli in Linguistics; Peter Heeman, Marc Light, David Traum, and one of us (Massimo Poesio) among the NLP students in CS, as well as students of Dana
Ballard such as Polly Pook. Social life and intellectual life mixed in events like pasta at Tom Bever X  X  after the seminar. During this period she also began her collaboration and friendship with Greg Whittemore, then at Kodak, that was to continue later in
Edinburgh. 476 in general, as her area of interest X  X n area that would remain the main focus of her research throughout her career. She went through her Ph.D. career very quickly, the first among her Linguistics colleagues to pass quals, the first to publish a paper at a major linguistics conference (Hitzeman 1991), and the first to graduate, in 1993, with a dissertation on  X  X emporal Adverbials and the Syntax-Semantics Interface X  in which she proposed that the alternative interpretations of temporal adverbials like for could actually be derived from information structure without the need to stipulate an ambiguity (Hitzeman 1997).

Group in Edinburgh, offered her her first job. Here is Marc remembering how this came about:
The snow didn X  X  change Marc X  X  mind, and Janet spent six years in Edinburgh, continu-ing her work on temporal expressions but also starting research in new areas including discourse, natural language generation, and prosody. Her work on temporal expression interpretation led to her most cited article (Hitzeman, Moens, and Grover 1995), also included in The Language of Time , the recent collection of classics in temporal expression interpretation edited by Mani et al. (Mani, Pustejovsky, and Gaizauskas 2005). Her work on the ILEX NLG project (Hitzeman, Mellish, and Oberlander 1997) resulted instead in her getting interested in discourse, in particular the effect of local and global salience on the interpretation of anaphoric expressions (Hitzeman and Poesio 1998; Poesio et al. 2004). This research was grounded in empirical data resulting from an annotation effort that Janet started and that was to lead eventually to the creation of the GNOME corpus.
She also became interested in the relation between discourse structure and prosody, getting involved in one of the first projects attempting to use discourse information to improve speech synthesis (Hitzeman et al. 1998). Finally, she became a key element of the social life at the Human Communication Research Centre, which had at its heart the
Friday pub night at Maxie X  X  that she instituted and drove forward with Matt Crocker and Shona Douglas. Here is Matt reminiscing about that time:
In 2000 Janet moved back to the U.S. to work at MITRE Bedford, where she continued her research on corpus annotation, discourse, and temporal expressions but moved the primary application focus to information extraction.
 schemes, and was happiest when up close to the linguistic data, especially non-garden-variety corpora such as financial filings, disease-tracking e-mails, chat room logs, blogs, and so forth. In her early years at MITRE Janet contributed to work on developing event extraction systems, working largely with rule-based mechanisms that exploited her understanding and interests in how language could express information of relevance to various tasks. A hallmark of her work was the close interaction of annotated corpus development and the design of heuristics grounded in that data. She contributed to the early versions of standards like TimeML, and was a key figure behind the development of SpatialML.
 processing applications in such diverse areas as global disease outbreak monitoring, topic tracking in chat, and fraud detection from financial data. Among the best known papers resulting from Janet X  X  work on information extraction while at MITRE are Mani et al. (2008) on SpatialML and Wellner et al. (2007) on de-identification. At the time of her death, Janet was in her second year as principal investigator of a project developing a prototype to monitor World Health Organization disease outbreak announcements.
This system was able to exploit the unique aspects of this  X  X icro-genre X  to achieve very high levels of accuracy in automatically recognizing and mapping disease outbreak information with Google Earth (Hitzeman 2008). Janet also got involved in research on using dialogue for collaborative learning, in cooperation with Brad Goodman and colleagues (Goodman et al. 2005). Last but not least, she developed large portions of hand-annotated corpora still used to pursue research of various kinds: In addition to the
SpatialML data, she was the key annotator for the cross-document coreference annota-tion corpus developed for the 2007 Johns Hopkins Summer Workshop on coreference resolution (Day et al. 2008).
 after not only for her expertise and diligence but as one of the most considerate and pleasant of colleagues to work with, always at hand with a wry comment or an astute linguistic observation. She managed to continue contributing to the area of the linguis-tics of temporal expressions, even as her MITRE work diverged into many different areas.
 and at summer schools like ESSLLI, and was popular with everybody in the community.
This was because she was incredibly warm and always had a charming interest in what people were up to, in research and in personal life. An additional reason for her popularity was that she was a great storyteller and a great listener. Her e-mails were always eagerly received as they would always contain consistently funny accounts of her encounters with Superglue, dogs, or camels. In a word, she was a great source of joy for all of us.

 parsing and semantic analysis. In parsing, he extended the GLR parsing algorithm to incorporate probabilities, multiple connection tables, and simultaneously carry out morphological and syntactic analysis for non-segmenting languages such as Japanese (Tanaka, Tokunaga, and Aizawa 1993; Inui et al. 1997; Shirai et al. 2000). His research on semantic analysis covered a broad spectrum, encompassing word sense disambiguation (Fujii et al. 1998), spoken language understanding for virtual agent systems (Shinyama,
Tokunaga, and Tanaka 2000), lexical semantic approaches to query expansion in in-formation retrieval (Mandala, Tokunaga, and Tanaka 2000), and metaphor processing (Iwayama, Tokunaga, and Tanaka 1990). He also carried out research on machine trans-lation (Tanaka, Isahara, and Yasuhara 1983; Tanaka 1999b; Baldwin and Tanaka 2000), computer-assisted language learning (Bilac, Baldwin, and Tanaka 2002), speech recog-nition (Itou, Hayamizu, and Tanaka 1992; Li, Tanaka, and Tokunaga 1995), dialogue sys-tems (Akiba and Tanaka 1994; Funakoshi, Tokunaga, and Tanaka 2002), and automatic music generation (Suzuki, Tokunaga, and Tanaka 1999). He was the author or editor of a number of popular introductory texts on NLP in Japanese (Tanaka 1989, 1999a).
Machine Translation Project (1987 X 1995) between East and South-East Asian languages (Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Indonesian, and Malay). He also initiated a project on lan-guage resources for Asian languages which was funded by the Japanese Ministry of
Education, and organized a number of workshops on the topic. The workshop series on Asian Language Resources, which had its seventh iteration at ACL-IJCNLP 2009, grew out of this. These initiatives laid the bedrock for the establishment of the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing (AFNLP) in 2005.

Tanaka-sensei received his Ph.D. from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1981 (Tanaka 1981), and accepted an Associate Professorship at the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1983. He became a full professor in 1986, and remained in that position until his retirement from the university in 2005. As is common in Japan, on retirement from the national university system, he took up a professorship at a private university, namely Chukyo University; he remained in this position until March 2009. During his combined time at the Tokyo
Institute of Technology and Chukyo University, he supervised more than 200 students (including 27 Ph.D. students). From April 200 9he held a Research Professorship at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.
