 For a researcher, keeping up with what is going on in their research field can be a difficult and time-consuming task. For example, a fresh PhD student may want to know what are the relevant papers matching their research interests. An assistant professor may like to be up-to-date with what their colleagues are publishing. A professor might want to be notified about funding opportunities relevant to the work done in their research group. Since the volume of published research and research activity is constantly growing, it is becoming increasingly more difficult for researchers to be able to manage and filter through the research information flow.

In this challenging context, Mendeley X  X  mission is to be-come the world X  X   X  X esearch operating system X . We do this not only by providing our well-know reference management system, but also by providing discovery capabilities for re-searchers on different kinds of entities, such as articles and profiles. In our talk, we will share Mendeley X  X  experiences with building our article and profile recommendation sys-tems, the challenges that we have faced and the solutions that we have put in place. We will discuss how we address different users X  needs with our data and algorithm infras-tructure to achieve good user experience.
