Machine Transliteration deals with the conversion of text strings from one orthography to another, while preserving the phonetics of the strings in the two languages. Translit-eration is an important problem in machine translation or cross-lingual information retrieval, as most proper names and generic iconic terms are out-of-vocabulary words, and therefore need to be transliterated. In this demo, we present Babel , a transliteration workbench, with generic statisti-cal learning algorithms and a scripting engine to model the transliteration process. We demonstrate quick assembly of necessary components  X  algorithmic modules and training scripts  X  for systematic experimentation of transliteration tasks in a given pair of languages.
The transliteration problem is modeled as a noisy chan-nel in Babel , as in the popular IBM Source-Channel models [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] for machine translation, with two specific changes: first, using graphemes instead of words, and, second, us-ing monotonic alignment algorithms on training data. We bootstrap with an initial training using alignment proba-bilities estimated by the matching prefixes and suffixes of the paired strings in the training data, using an expectation maximization approach. Subsequently, we use viterbi algo-rithm to find the optimal alignments and iteratively refine the estimated model.

Babel allows different algorithmic modules to be added, and currently includes a scripting engine to model the translit-eration tasks. The transliteration quality measures are com-put edontop-n probabletransliterationreturnedby Ba b e l ,
