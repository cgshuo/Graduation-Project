 1. Introduction
In recent years the availability of communication data has allowed us to analyse the nature of human relationships and inter-actions on a much larger scale than previously available (see, for example, Onnela et al., 2007 ). Although modes of communication have changed however, our brain sizes have not, and it is suggested there is a cognitive constraint on the number of face-to-face social interactions one may have ( Dunbar, 1993; Roberts et al., 2009 ). This constraint fits in a broad sense with the  X  X ocial brain hypothesis X  which argues that the evolution of primate brains was driven by the need to maintain increasingly large social groups ( Humphrey, 1976; Dunbar, 1992, 1998; Barton and Dunbar, 1997 ).

Individuals do not give equal weight to each relationship and evidence from the social brain hypothesis suggests that ego networks are structured into a sequence of layers with the size of each layer increasing as emotional closeness decreases ( Dunbar, 1998; Hill and Dunbar, 2003 ). The mean number of friends in each has been found to be around 5, 15, 50 and 150 in the cumulative lay-ers (i.e. on average 10 people in the second layer to make a total of 15) ( Zhou et al., 2005; Hamilton et al., 2007 ). Beyond this there are even larger groupings suggested at 500 and 1500 ( Dunbar, 1993; Zhou et al., 2005 ).

Recently these Dunbar layers have been observed in online social media, such as Facebook and Twitter ( Dunbar et al., 2015 ) and an online computer game ( Fuchs et al., 2014 ). These
People vary in the extent to which they use their phones, with some using it as a regular means of communication with family and friends, and others using it only for social emergencies or to arrange meetings. While the former are likely to provide a full cov-erage of their social network, the latter won X  X . To avoid this kind of under-reporting, we censored the dataset so as to include only those individuals with a minimum number of alters. Since the aver-age number of alters at a given time in personal, or ego-centric, networks is 150, with a natural range of approximately 100 X 250 ( Hill and Dunbar, 2003; Zhou et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 2009 ), we set a value of 100 alters as the minimum cut-off. By doing so, we aimed to have a more complete distribution of actual ego networks, while not biasing against individuals who have natu-rally small networks. After this we lower the cut-off to 50 alters to observe the results for lower frequency users.

The degree k of an ego represents the number of alters called and the weighted degree w represents the total number of calls an ego makes. The degree distribution p k and weighted distribu-tion p w are the fraction of vertices in a network with degree k and weighted degree w , respectively. Note that in empirical networks, the degree distributions are often found to have positive or right skew ( Newman, 2003 ).

In order to estimate the functional forms of degree distribution, the method of Maximum Likelihood Estimators is used ( Clauset et al., 2009; Edwards et al., 2007 ). Here we test different distri-butions; namely power law, exponential, stretched exponential, Gaussian (or normal) and log-normal distributions, and use the Akaike Information Criteria to select the best model ( Akaike, 1974; Burnham and Anderson, 2002 ).

The data for each user is considered as a one dimensional array which we denote by W such that the minimum possible weight is w = 1 when an ego calls an alter once. There is no real upper limit (beyond financial or time constraints) to the maximum number of calls a user can make to their preferred alter. In order to compare users, the data for user i is normalised by W = W i  X  W i min where W i is the number of calls made to each alter and W
W i max are minimum and maximum number of calls they make to any of their alters. This ensures that, for each ego, the strongest interaction with an alter is 1 and the weakest is 0. A first estimate to identify the layers is to plot the probability density of all differ-ent weights for all users to ascertain if any pattern exists. A kernel density estimate is applied to the true probability density and the local minima are used to identify clusters ( Rosenblatt et al., 1956; Parzen, 1962 ).

Many methods exist for data clustering, (see, for example, Jain et al., 1999; Gan et al., 2007 ). The vast majority of these algo-rithms, however, are for high-dimensional datasets ( Jain, 2010 ).
Here, although we are dealing with big data, we seek to break each individual X  X  calls into clusters or layers. Thus we are dealing with one-dimensional clustering for each user, and from this we analyse the average layer sizes.

A common method for one-dimensional clustering is the Jenks natural breaks algorithm ( Jenks, 1967 ). The Jenks algorithm is simi-lar to k -means clustering in one dimension ( Khan, 2012 ). It searches for the minimum distance between data points and the centres of the clusters they belong to as well as for maximum difference between cluster centres themselves. The goodness of fit can be cal-culated to optimise the number of clusters found ( Coulson, 1987 ).
A goodness of fit of 1.0 can only be attained when there is zero within-class variation (often when the number of clusters is the same size as the data). To choose the optimal number of clusters we take a threshold of 0.85 for the goodness of fit as suggested in Coulson (1987) .
 that are in the lower bound of the outer layer, i.e. have called 100 or more alters. This leaves 26,680 users with a mean number of alters of 129.9 and standard deviation of 37.7. The mean number of calls an ego makes is 3553.8 with a standard deviation of 1894.1. We also analyse users with 50 &lt; k &lt; 100 ( N = 301,190). These have an average weighted degree of 1964.2. The remaining users with k &lt; 50 have an mean weighted degree of 148.8 indicating they use their phone on average less than once every two days.

The degree distribution and the weighted degree distribution for the entire dataset are shown in Fig. 1 with log-normal distribu-tions fitted. The inset in the left panel shows the degree distribution for users with degree k  X  100, which follows as similar distribu-tion. Both truncated power-law and log-normal models yield high
Akaike weights for the degree distribution but with slightly more support for the log-normal behaviour (a truncated power law is fitted to the dataset in Onnela et al. (2007) ). Hence we consider that, of the candidate models, the log-normal model has the highest support for the weighted degree distribution.

Log-normal distributions are associated with multiplicative pro-cesses, in contrast with Gaussian distributions which are additive.
An important consequence of a log-normal distribution is that in a growth process, the growth rate is independent of the size ( Sutton, 1997 ). In terms the degree distribution, this means that the rate of growth of an ego X  X  number of friends is independent of their cur-rent number of friends. Log-normal distributions are found in many empirical datasets ( Eeckhout, 2004; Mitzenmacher, 2004; Clauset et al., 2009 ).

Having established that the data is log-normally distributed, before normalising the weight array in Eq. (1) , the log of each weight is taken. Fig. 2 shows the histogram for the normalised log of the weights  X  w for all users. There are peaks at 0 and 1 as every user has at least one alter they call a minimal number of times (usually mul-tiple) and at least one alter they call a maximum number of times.
Although the data is very noisy, we observe peaks indicating that there are some groupings within the data. The blue line is a Gauss-ian kernel density estimate of the distribution. The local minima on average split the number of alters into groups of 15 until the normalised strength of a relationship  X  w = 0 . 28 after which there are an average of 68.8 alters. This could roughly correspond to the third Dunbar layer of 50. Beyond this region, the data is too noisy to split up further on a group level.
 The probability distributions for 4 and 5 clusters are shown in
Fig. 4 . Each cluster is log-normally distributed. This is perhaps not surprising given that the original distribution is log-normal; there is already a large variation with some users perhaps having 100 friends split into 4 clusters and others having almost 500 split into 4 clusters. Therefore even if the estimates for the mean size of each layer are accurate, there is large variance with numbers of alters going far to the right of these means.

Next we use a Gaussian Mixture Model to split the data. For this algorithm, we however take the log of the data as it is log-normally distributed and not Gaussian. In this case 9289 of the users are split into 2 clusters and 3334 users into 3 clusters. (The model finds about 1000 thousand users in each cluster above this up to 12 clusters.) The average and standard deviations are reported in Table 1 . For 2 clusters, the cumulative layer-size means are 43.0 and 122.9 users, which again are quite close to the outer two Dunbar layers. For 3 clusters the means are at 18.0, 59.7 and 126.4 users which are close to the outer three layers but miss the inner one.

Lastly we apply the head/tail breaks algorithm. For users with more than 100 alters, it finds 12,951 users in 3 clusters with cumu-lative layer sizes of 4.3, 22.4 and 122.9 users and 11,616 users in 4 clusters with cumulative layer sizes of 2.2, 8.2, 29.8 and 133.5 users.
The full details are reported in Table 1 . Again, the layers are found to be log-normally distributed using this method.

Each of the three algorithms finds small number of layers for the majority of the data. The Jenks and head/tails algorithms find an inner layer ranging from 2.2 to 4.3 alters and almost all algorithms yield a large outer layer of 80 X 100 alters at the end. The Jenks algo-rithm and Gaussian Mixture Model both give good evidence for the outer two layers.

If we assume that the majority of 4 clusters is the appropriate value, we can use the Jenks algorithm to force everyone into 4 clus-ters. The values of the cumulative layers are then 3.5, 10.6, 31.1 and 129.9 users, which are slightly smaller numbers than those conventionally considered for the Dunbar layers, but have virtually the same scaling ratio between the layers, i.e. on average, 3.3 here, compared to an average of 3.2 found by Zhou et al. (2005) and 3.2 in Facebook traffic by Dunbar et al. (2015) .

These results are from call frequency. We also have the duration of each call. The duration and call frequency are highly correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.71. For egos with k  X  100 this is slightly higher at r = 0.76. Using the Jenks algorithm this again yields a majority of egos with 4 clusters (27% of egos) with cumulative layers of 3.9, 10.1, 27.2 and 129.3. These are slightly lower than the results for call frequency.
 the outer two layers. While the data is noisy, all methods support two different groupings well. This could, for example, mean intro-verts and extroverts have a different number of layers of friends.
Further work could investigate this possibility. Another suggestion is that over a year, friendships are more transient. Alters could move up or down from one layer to the next on a regular basis. This would reflect the temporal nature of emotional closeness, espe-cially among one X  X  non-closest friends.

The Jenks algorithm and Gaussian Mixture Model for four layers, they give results close to the Dunbar layers. In addition, they have the same scaling pattern (  X  3) as has previously been reported for the structure of offline egocentric social networks and the organi-sation of natural communities ( Zhou et al., 2005; Hamilton et al., 2007 ), Facebook and Twitter traffic ( Dunbar et al., 2015 ) and online gaming environments ( Fuchs et al., 2014 ). We still do not have any principled explanation for why these structural layers should have such a consistent pattern, but they are closely tied into the psycho-logical aspects of relationships like emotional closeness ( Sutcliffe et al., 2012 ).

The means in the clusters are generally smaller than the pre-dicted means from the Dunbar layers, though they match the ranges found in Hill and Dunbar (2003) . A reason they could be smaller here is due to the fact that a mobile phone call dataset only cap-tures a portion of an ego X  X  social network, even with taking users who call more than 100 alters. With many other modes of com-munication available, it is unlikely that a user would only resort to phoning their friends. We emphasise however, that the year 2007 is a good time to use cellphone data for this kind of analysis as it is just prior to smart phones (the first iPhone was released a few months before this dataset ends) which facilitates many other avenues of online communication. It is also before platforms, such as Skype or
Facebook, were at the height of their popularity. We also show that users who call 50 X 100 people throughout the year match the inner three Dunbar layers well.

This study has strong implications for the social brain hypothe-sis as, regardless of the mode of communication, similar structure is observed. Future work on this will involve analysing the turnover time in the layers using temporal data in different communication datasets. We believe that the turnover time will relate to the emo-tional closeness, for example the inner layer is likely to be more robust in phone data than on Twitter.

A final point of note here is on the structure of the layers. From each algorithm we find that the layers are log-normally distributed for all number of clusters. This, to the best of our knowledge, has not been observed before. It is important to point out that this right-ward skew and large standard deviation exist. The log-normality is due to the entire degree distribution being log-normal and thus already having considerable skew. This potentially also shows a dif-ference between extroverts, who tend to have a number of friends far greater than the mean. Regardless of their number of friends however, they still show evidence of layers.
