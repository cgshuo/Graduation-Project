 Prior studies have questioned the degree of anonymity of the double-blind review process for schol arly research articles. For example, one study based on a surv ey of reviewers concluded that combination of the author X  X  reference list and the referee X  X  personal background knowledge. For the KDD Cup 2003 competition X  X   X  X pen Task, X  we examined how well various automatic matching techniques could identify authors within the competition X  X  very large archive of research papers. This paper describes the issues surrounding author identification, how these issues motivated our study, and the results we obtained. The best method, based on discri minative self-citations, identified authors correctly 40-45% of the time. One main motivation for double-blind review is to eliminate bias in favor of well-known authors. However, identification accuracy for authors with substantial publication history is even better (60% accuracy for the top-10% most prolific authors, 85% for authors with 100 or more prior papers). KDD Cup competition, author identification, social network analysis, relational learning, vector-space model, discriminative self-citations The peer review process, applied to the publication of academic journal articles as well as confer ence submissions, has been held as the premier control mechanism for the quality of scholarly publications [1]. In most cases, the journal editorial board and a select group of anonymous qualifie d experts jointly determine the fate of a proposed research article on the basis of scholarly contribution. Although most authors agree the peer review process is indispensable [2], the process is not without flaws [3]. The main problems have been elaborated in the medical field, where the dissemination of low-quality information has the potential to influence loss of life. Among the many concerns [4] is bias [5]. Authors may be di scriminated against based on their affiliation and demographic characteristics or preferred because of their reputation or influence in the scholarly community. One potential way to address bias is the adoption of a double-blind review process. In a single-blind review process the author does not know the identity of the reviewers. In a double-blind review process the identities of both the authors and the reviewers are concealed. A journal may adopt a double-blind pr ocess to improve fairness or to improve the perception of fairness (or both). ( There is evidence that referees are more critical when they are unaware of the authors X  identities [6].) The American Journal of Public Health, a journal that practices double-blind reviews, surveyed 312 reviewers in 1989 to identify author and institution of review ed manuscripts. The results indicate that authors could be identified by reviewers using the combination of the paper X  X  reference list and the referee X  X  personal background knowledge [7]. As part of the KDD Cup 2003 competition, we analyzed a very large archive of physics papers. Our goal was to assess how well authors of papers could be id entified using only the citations made in the papers. We examin ed several methods for automatic identification, falling into two general classes: (1) a (dynamic) vector-space model that represents both papers and author histories, and (2) tallying (discriminative) self-citations. The self-citation based met hods generally worked better. However, the vector-space models are able to match (with much lower accuracy) even when self-citations are removed. With the best method, based on discriminative self-citations, authors can be identified 45% of the time. Additionally, the top-10% most prolific authors can be identified 60% of the time. Extremely prolific authors can be identified much more often; for example, authors with 100 or more prior publications can be identified 85% of the time. Author identification by citation matching is directly related to social network analysis [8], graph theory [9], and bibliometrics [10]. These research areas all study similar methods for graph matching. In social network analysis, the task of identity matching is cast as a structural equivalence problem [11], in standard graph theory, as subgraph isomorphism, and in bibliographic coupling [12] has been used to establish the subject similarity of documents for information retrieval. Text-based methods also have been used for author attribution [13, 14] and for gender classification [15]. We include a dynamic vector-space model because publication records have a temporal dimension. For example, authors move to new research areas and change c itation behavior as they progress through a research program. Hence, an author X  X  citation history is at best only an approximation of fu ture citation behavior. Inexact graph matching is necessary when a match between two structures must be found in the presence of structural noise [16, 17]. While research on graph matching is abundant, so far we know of relatively little work on dynamic graph matching. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, we present the vector-space models in section 2. In section 3 we apply the vector-space models to the task of author identification for the KDD Cup 2003 citation database and present results. In section 4, we consider approaches utiliz ing only the citation list of the current paper, relying on self-cita tions for author identification. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the results. We reduce the dynamic author citation graph to a set of feature vectors for two types of entities : authors and papers. Each paper X  X  feature vector represents a candidate query for identification. Each author-history feature vector summarizes an author X  X  previous citation behavior. During the author identification process, new pa pers, stripped of explicitly identifiable information, are comp ared to labeled author-history feature vectors. In the vector space model [18], a query is represented by a n -dimensional vector where n is the number of possible terms in the vector. Applying the vector-space model to our task, the query vector represents a new paper where the author is to be identified and the number of non-null dimensions in the vector depends on the number of (unique) citations in the paper. The query vector of a paper is compared to each author-history vector. Various weighting schemes and similarity measures could be used; we discuss these in detail below. For dynamic graphs we need to capture the dynamics of transient relational ties. A relational tie [8] establishes a linkage between a pair of entities. In our example, a relational tie is established when authors cite prior papers. We give each relational tie a weight to indicate its strength. Each author may have multiple relationships to multiple papers. We represent each author with a vector of weights. To capture the dynami c nature of authors X  publication records, our  X  X ecayed counts X  technique iteratively updates each author X  X  weight vector over time. With each new published document, the weights of old citati ons are reduced, so as to lessen their importance for subsequent au thor identification. Similar dynamic identification methods have been used to detect repetitive defaulters in large telecommunication networks [19] and in machine vision to identify visual objects in pictures with dynamic scenes [20]. To create the paper vectors and the author-history vectors, a weight is associated with each potentially cited paper. A weight of zero is assigned when there is no relationship between two entities (e.g., an author never cited a particular paper). This structure enables us to represent an approximation of the author X  X  entire temporal citation graph as well as new papers in the same vector space. Definition: An entity e i is described by a feature vector where w is the weight assigned to the relational tie between e paper p k (1). The feature-vector weights can emphasize important relationships. Each individual we ight is determined by some aggregation of the relationship(s) between the entity and the paper. There are different, and sometimes opposing, notions of importance that can be captured by the weights. For example, it may be important to focus on an author X  X  current  X  X ehavior, X  giving higher weight to citations in more recent (historical) papers. On the other hand, it may be important to give higher weight to distinctive citations, even if they have not been cited recently. Ideally, we would like for the author-history vectors to represent frequency, recency, and idiosyncrasy of cited papers. For the vector-space model used in this paper, we consider bina ry weights, simp le counts, and decayed counts for author-history vectors; for paper vectors, the counts are always one or zero. 1 1) Binary weights are one when any relationship exists 2) Simple counts represent the total number of papers in 3) Decayed counts also consider the total number of times a During the author-identificati on process, new papers are compared to every non-null author-history vector. Candidate match sets of author-history vectors most similar to the query are ranked and returned. For this paper, we use cosine similarity, which is commonly used with the vector-space model [21] . We incrementally modify the author-history vectors as new papers appear with time. When a new paper query is presented, it is compared to the contemporaneous author-history vectors. A match is considered to be correct when the method correctly identifies at least one author of the paper. We also report how often an author is in the top-10 and top-100 highest-ranked authors for the paper (of 7424 total authors). We attempt to identify authors of papers from the KDD Cup 2003 paper archive. This database is from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center SPIRES-HEP archive comprising High Energy Particle Physics (HEP) articles spanning the years 1992-2003. We first present results using the dynamic vector-space The paper-vector weights can be other than zero or one, as we will see for the discriminative self-citations. Using discriminative weights may improve the performance of the vector-space model as well, but here we do not consider them. model, where author identification succeeds 26-32% of the time. Later, in Section 4, we will pr esent self-citation-based methods that perform even better, but befo re doing so we will show results with the vector-space model with self-citations removed. For the 29,514 papers, we parsed the author names from each name, resulting in a total of 7424 authors. Eliminating part of the author name in some cases ma y contribute to a loss in data Name ambiguity could have opposing effects on matching accuracy. Because the total number of authors is reduced, it may serve to increase accuracy; howev er, it seems unlikely that an erroneous match would happen to be to someone with the same first initial and last name. It seems more likely that name ambiguity would degrade the quality of the author-history vectors, by mixing the citations of different people X  X aking the correct author seem less similar, and thereby reducing accuracy. So, using first-initial/last-name pa irs seems a conservative choice. We first sorted the papers by s ubmission date. We incrementally updated the author-history vectors with each new paper. We only use citations to other papers within the database ( intra-database citations). 3 At each new paper presentation, the author-history vectors comprise all past citations in the database. For estimating accuracy we used (as a  X  X est set X ) the 12,387 papers submitted between 1999 and 2002. Table 1a presents top-N match re sults for N=1,10, and 100. N=10 and N=100 are interesting because a citations-only method may be used as a preprocess to co mputationally expensive methods such as textual analysis. N=10 and N=100 also give a rough idea of how well similar matching met hods could hope to do with the present experimental setup. Decayed counts as weights performed best, matching 26% of the authors exactly. However, we lack information on some test papers. In particular, some pa pers have no (intra-database) citations. No method based solely on citations would be able to match these papers accurately to prior authors, using the current experimental setup. Once the pa pers containing no citations are removed, matching accuracy improves marginally (to 27%). Further investigation indicates that there are some test documents for which we are seeing the au thor(s) for the first time; no matching method based on prior be havior (citing behavior or otherwise) would be able to identify a new author if no author Note that a more sophisticated sy stem ought be able to deal with the general phenomenon of a single author with multiple, non-overlapping research interests. A corresponding modification of the current method is to cl uster papers by citations and represent an author by multip le author-history vectors. A paper, of course, could cite pa pers not in this database. We used the information made available explicitly for the 
KDDCUP competition. Including extra-database citations arguably may improve matching accuracy significantly; for example, authors may be more identifiable through habits of citing particular papers from out side the immediate research community. history is available. Excluding doc uments with no author history, matching accuracy again increases marginally (to 28%). So, although having information on both the new entity and past behavior is necessary for matchi ng success, the lack thereof does not seem to play a major role in the observed matching accuracy. However, there are many cases where there are both intra-database citations and corres ponding author history, but the vector-space methods still do not id entify the author correctly. One possible explanation is that author citation behavior has changed dramatically. For example, an extreme case would be when an author moves to a completely different research topic and there is no citation overlap at a ll with the author X  X  past papers. If we include only papers with at least one paper in common with at least one author, matching accuracy improves to 32%. In sum, depending on what we are willing to exclude, the dynamic vector-space method successfully identifies correctly approximately 1/4-1/3 of the cases using only intra-database citations. Furthermore, it places an author in the top-10 67% of the time and in the top-100 89% of the time. In general, and not surprisingly, the amount of overlap between a paper X  X  citation list and an author X  X  history is a reasonable predictor for matching success. For example, if we cons ider only those papers for which an author X  X  history has greater th an 5 citations in common, we can match 40% of the time, place in the top-10 75% of the time, and place in the top-100 95% of the time. Although identification of authors based solely on intra-database citations is a restricted setting, being able to identify authors successfully in 1/4-1/3 of the cases based only on this information (not even considering linguistic mannerisms or distinctive nuances of the research) certainly calls into question the notion that reviewing is truly double-blind. Self-citations occur when authors cite their own prior work. There is anecdotal evidence that self-citations are an important identifier of paper authorship, and in the following section we will show methods based only on self-citations that identify authors better than our best current vector-space method. Although a policy of eliminating self-citations is not a solution for improving double-blind review, it is interesting to investigate how much of the performance of the vector-space me thod is due to identifiability through self-citations. (Methods that are not dependent on counting self-citations also are of interest because author counts in a citation list are particularly easy for authors to manipulate.) Table 1b shows the results of applying the vector-space model with decayed-count weights, using the same set-up as above except with all self-citations rem oved. Again, depending on what we are willing to exclude, the dynamic vector-space method successfully identifies approximately 1/6-1/5 of the cases using only intra-database citations. Furthermore, it places an author in the top-10 47% of the time and top-100 79% of the time. Note that none of the vector-space results presented here take into account the discriminability of the c itations. As we will see in the next section, weighting citations by their discriminability can improve citation-based author identification. The vector-space methods model an author X  X  historical citation pattern, under the assumption that citations in a new paper will follow the historical pattern. A completely different approach is to take advantage of the tendency of authors to cite their own work. This suggests a straightforward method for identifying authors based on counting cited authors: choose the author with the largest number of citations in the present paper. Results for self-citation-based me thods were generated following the same process described in detail in Section 2, except that author-history vectors are not needed. We used the same subset of papers to enable direct comparison. Table 2 shows the accuracies of the cited-author-count method, compared with the corresponding accuracies of the vector-space model using decayed counts, for the entire test-set and for the  X  X t least one overlap X  case (discussed above). Overlap is not meaningful for the self-citation-based method, since it does not use author history; the accuracies are reported for comparison. The self-citation method clearly dominates the vector-space method, and author-identification accuracies are remarkable: almost 40% of authors can be identified exactly. (vector-space model)

At the highly discriminative for this author (in the future). This suggests the design of me thods based on discriminative citations. For example, a discriminative method could distinguish authors for (self-)citi ng papers that historically have seldom been cited. Specifically, rather than simply tallying the citations by author, the following discriminative self-citation methods sum up a set of paper-specific  X  X nverse frequency X  weights, which give higher weight to seldom-cited papers (cf., inverse-document frequency [21]).

If 100 prior papers have cited the paper in questi on, then the weight would be 1/100. 2) Inverse citation-frequency weights assign to citations the log of the reciprocal of the frequency that the paper has been cited by past papers; i.e., if there are N total papers in the database and c of them cite th e paper in question, the paper X  X  weight is log(N/c). For either weighting scheme, the score for an author for a test paper p is the sum of the weights of all papers by that author that are cited by p .

N is the number of top-ranked authors considered (e.g., N=1 corresponds to a correct match to the highest-ranked author). Results include self-citations. An alternative is to use the numbe r of authors who cite the paper. These discriminative self-cita tion-based methods perform remarkably well, as shown in Table 3. The inverse author frequency method performs best, identifying 40-45% of the papers X  authors correctly. All these self-citation-based methods will work only if the author appears in the citation list. Howe ver, even with this limitation, the methods have substantially higher accuracy than the vector-space methods. Figure 2: Accuracy of author id entification as a function of matching score, using inverse ci tation-frequencies, along with the corresponding cumulative distribution (the smooth curve). Figure 2 shows the accuracy of author identification as a function of the papers X  maximum invers e citation-frequency scores, along with the corresponding cumulative distribution. Not surprisingly, the more citations a paper has to the most-cited author, the higher the identification accuracy (because it is more likely that this is an author of the paper). Figure 3: Accuracy of author identification for the inverse citation-frequency method as a function of the number of prior papers written by the paper X  X  (most prolific) author, along with the corresponding cumulative distribution (the smooth curve). Author identification accuracy in creases linearly with the number of prior papers written. The more prolific authors can be identified more than half the time. The top-10% most prolific authors can be identified 60% of the time. Authors with 100 or more prior publications can be identified 85% of the time! Accuracy Accuracy 
Accuracy Using the KDDCUP 2003 physics-paper archive, we examine the ability to identify paper authorship automatically using only citation lists. For these papers , the discriminative self-citation-based method was able to identify authorship almost half of the time. Generally, the methods we examined were able to identify authorship between 25% and 45% of the time X  X ased only on intra-database citations. It is possible that this may be improved by combining citation-based met hods with text-based methods. One of the main concerns surrounding the peer review process is that authors will be given preferential treatment because of their reputation. These results suggest that even when review boards institute double-blind review, many authors may be identified anyway based solely on their citations. In particular, authors with extensive publication histories can be identified well. One limitation of this study as a criticism of double-blind review is that the results are based on published papers, not papers submitted for review. However, authors of papers submitted for review may be even easier to identify, because typically the citation list has not yet been fleshed out based on the recommendations of the reviewers, and therefore may be even more similar to an author X  X  hist orical pattern of citations (and self-citations may constitute a larger fraction of the total citations). On the other hand, if an author wanted increased anonymity she could reduce the num ber of self-citations in the submitted version (and further obscu re her publication list). This would have little effect on the main concern discussed above, because authors with good reputations would seldom be motivated to hide their identities. The self-citation results do suggest a method for decreasing identifiability: include many citations to a well-known author.
