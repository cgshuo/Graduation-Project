 A company always has various names. For examples, a Chinese telecom company, with  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X   X  as its full name, also has  X   X  X  X   X   X  and  X   X   X   X  as its Chi-nese abbreviative names, and  X  X hina Unicom X  as its English abbreviative name, all of which appear in different occasions. For exam ples, as shown in Chart 1, in Sample A, appear; while in Sample C, the English and Chinese names of the same company and extracting company information in our company IE system, since (1) It is hard to identify abbreviative Ch inese company names, because there isn X  X  (2) It is hard to discover relationship between the names. For examples, as shown 
To solve these problems, a feasible solutio n is to build up a large-scaled company tions. With this name knowledge base, identification of the company names and their correlations will become much easier, whenever and wherever they appear in the text. great number of companies have set up their own websites for introducing themselves 158,293 domains ended with  X .com.cn X  until 2004, about 41.4% of the whole do-ended with  X .com X , and many without isolated domains. According to these facts, we can conclude that it is feasible to acquire information about company names from the Internet. 
In the Internet, we find that the homepage is a kind of special page, around which company names gather. Therefore, we concentrate ourselves on the homepage to gether with their relations. By this way, we have built the knowledge base, and use it to identify abbreviate names and their relationships. And experiment result shows that this method is effective. 
This method relates to Link Analysis. As we know, web can be modeled as a di-page B, it means that author of webpage A found webpage B being more valuable. Based on this assumption, we believe that anchor name of the hyperlink is also valu-able, so most name candidates are collected from the anchor names in this method. 
Except that it can be applied to our system, the knowledge base can also be put into use in the following areas: 
In this paper, section 2 will propose basic concept and methodology; section 3 will in-troduce several applications and experiment results; section 4 will give out conclusion. 2.1 Basic Concept which supply fruitful information for company names. But most web information is which always has a large outdegree and indegree, in other words, the homepage is not only a navigational page, but also always referenced by many other webpages. Since some other website, he will always make the hyperlink point to its homepage using its name as anchor name. According to the assumption of Link Analysis, this anchor name is reliable. So the anchor name is one important point where we can find com-pany names. Apart from it, company names always appear in various positions in the field in the source. A typical example is shown in Figure 1. Based on those facts, we regard the homepage as an information source, around which the company names gather. 
Another problem is to identify abbreviate company name. Although there is not any distinct internal feature, abbreviative company names almost derive from the full found, it is easy to check whether other strings are its abbreviation under the circum-stance of the homepage. Since rich name information gathers around the homepage, various company names can be collected and processed there as well. 
From the above discussions, there are five steps for building company name knowl-edge base: In the following, we will emphasis on the 2nd and the 4th step. 2.2 Locating the Company Homepage Restricted to the company field, the method of homepage finding is much easier and faster than TREC Homepage Finding task. One obvious feature of the full company name is it always ends with such suffixes as  X   X  X   X ,  X   X   X   X  and  X  X nc X , so we can locate the company homepage just through hyperlinks with those specific anchor names. This method is easier and faster than iterating through every webpage, but there exist some problems: 
To solve the problem (1), we use a simple algorithm to rank a small group of web-pages based on the two evidences which are URL-type and hyperlink recommenda-tions [3] , and then pick up the webpage with highest score as the homepage. processing every webpage, the price of the homepage loss is worthwhile. 2.3 Identification of the Company Names After locating the company homepage, name candidates are collected from the fol-lowing four positions: (1) anchor names of hyperlinks pointing to this homepage; (2) homepage of China Unicom. 
There are ambiguities and errors in the candidates as shown in Chart 2, since updat-ing, setting up and removing websites may be frequent and hyperlinks are created by human, all of which will lead to the anchor names becoming out of date or some mis-takes made by human, e.g. the formal translation of  X  X BM X  is  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X , while  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  appears in a few texts if you search it in Google. Therefore, the candidates need be trimmed and analyzed. 
Another problem is how to pick up company names from candidates existing errors and ambiguities. Only depending on the frequency or the specific suffix is not enough, e.g. there are three candidates ended with the specific suffix  X   X  X   X  as shown in Chart 2. Hence in the analysis stage, correlations between the candidates should be concerned. E.g. in Chart 2,  X   X  X  X   X   X  is the abbreviation of  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X . Both of them belong to one company name cluster. 
Summarily, there are two steps in identify ing company name. The first step is trim-ming process and the second step is name analysis process. 
The trimming process is composed of such procedures as removing url from the traditional Chinese to simplified Chinese. The analysis process is based on the trimmed results. 
The name analysis process is mainly to rank candidates. Incorporating frequencies and correlations between the candidates into ranking algorithm, it is made up of two steps. (1) Discover correlations of the name candidates, so to build name cluster domi-nated by every full company name candidate. 
A name cluster is a set of names dominated by a full company name candidate, that correlations. After ranking, the best name cluster will be chosen as the company first is positions of the candidates appearing in the webpage; the second is number of webpages, we found that a name candidate at some specific position is more possible field of the homepage. The 2nd attribute is the most important feature, which denotes how popular the name cluster is. The name cluster with maximum popularity is most possible to be company names. The 3rd attribute is used to distinguish the language of the name cluster so that English and Chinese name clusters can be chosen separately. (2) Rank every name cluster. Score function is shown in Equation (1). 
In Equation (1), x stands for the name cluster, and T is the total host frequency of the whole name candidates, and  X  is the weight. Different position has different prior-P(anchor)=0.3, P(anchor &amp; title)=0.8. 
After the 2 nd step, we can pick up the name cluster with max score as the company name. For examples, in Chart 2, although  X   X  X  X   X   X  is ended with  X   X  X   X , yet it is only an abbreviation of  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X , so it can not be the company full name can-didate, and it belongs to the name cluster dominated by  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X . From scoring every name cluster, we can pick up one Chinese and one English name cluster from the name clusters. At last we store them and their correlations into the database. It is the whole process of building the company name knowledge base. After processing over 3,500,000 webpages, we have built up a knowledge base con-taining approximately 25,000 companies and about 40,000 company names. Based on this knowledge base, we have done three experiments. The first experiment is testing precision of the knowledge base; the second is evaluating company name normaliza-tion; the third is key word expansion about the company name. 
In the first experiment, we get part data randomly from the database and calculate precision manually. The results are shown in Chart 3. 
Most errors come from ambiguities in identifying full company names, such as  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X   X . Recall rate of the company name hasn X  X  been calculated, because hu-experiments. 
The second experiment is company name normalization. We have a corpus tagged with company names. At first, 734 company names including abbreviation and full names are extracted from this corpus, which are owned by 428 companies. They are regarded as keys, and then we normalize those 734 company names using the knowl-edge base. At last, we get the results that they belong to 537 companies, in which 397 companies exactly match the keys, but the rest of 31 companies haven X  X  been merged correctly. So precision of the normalization is 92.6%. 
Data sparseness is a main reason for these errors. If one company name has not  X   X  X  X  X  X  (Panasonic)  X ,  X  X etac(  X  X  X  X  X  ) X  and  X   X  X  X  Sanyo X . 
The third experiment is company key word expansion. Given some company names, we can expand those names by querying the company name knowledge base. Parts of the results retrieved from the knowledge base are shown in Chart 4. 
This knowledge base is also helpful for identifying named entities. Youzheng Wu [4] fore appearance of full name in his pool strategy; the second was that if the full name never appeared, the abbreviative names couldn X  X  be recognized. Essence of these two Restricted to the conditions, we haven X  X  done an experiment to evaluate on this idea. With explosively growing web information, how to extract useful information be-comes a challenge for information processing. Our company IE system is for the purpose of extracting web company intelligence to ease the human X  X  burden. Con-struction and maintenance of company name knowledge base is an important part of our system. Compared with other methods such as human labor, the automatic method is faster and more effective. This built knowledge base can not only solve the Chinese information extraction and expansion of the key word. The experiment re-sults show that the method is effective and the knowledge base can be used to solve realistic problems. more webpages are processed, we believe data sparseness problem can be alleviated.
