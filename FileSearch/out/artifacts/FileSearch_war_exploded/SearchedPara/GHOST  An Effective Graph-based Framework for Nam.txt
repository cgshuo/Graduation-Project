 Name ambiguity stems from the fact that many people or ob-jects share identical names. In this paper, we focus on inves-tigating the problem in digital libraries to distinguish publi-cations written by authors with identical names. We present an effective graph-based framework named GHOST (abbr. G rapH -based framewO rk for name diS tincT ion), to solve the problem systematically. We evaluated the framework on the real DBLP dataset, and the experimental results show that GHOST outperforms the state-of-the-art method.
 H.2 [ Database Management ]: Database applications; E.1 [ Data Structures ]: Graphs and networks Algorithms, Experimentation Name Distinction, Similarity, Clustering, Graph People retrieve information from various information sources. One problem that has been disturbing is that different peo-ple share identical names. Say we are looking for all publi-cations authored by  X  X ei Wang X  in a digital library. When the query is submitted, about 151 publications are retrieved in DBLP. There are no fewer than 39 different persons with this name, thus it is difficult to differentiate the publica-tions written by a person one really cares about from the rest ones belonging to other persons who happen to share the same author name. Our objective of name distinc-tion is to group publications coauthored by those with an identical name into clusters so that the elements in each cluster belong to the same author. Object distinction in [3], name disambiguation in [2] are problems most similar to it. In this paper we present a graph-based framework, GHOST, to address the problem systematically. It employs the attribute of coauthorship only and exploits the relation-ships/connections among every pair of publications via a model that is represented by a coauthorship graph.
In this section we will introduce the framework step by step, which consists of five subtasks. The database of publications D is represented by a graph G = { V , E } , where each node v  X  V represents an author, and an undirected edge represents a coauthorship. The edge between node a and node b has a label S ( a, b ), which denotes the complete set of publications coauthored by both a and b . This means that we collect all publications coauthored by a and b in order to denote a unique edge. Note that authors with an ambiguous name are treated as different nodes and other types of attributes are ignored.
If the same name which needs to be disambiguated ap-pears in both author lists of two papers and corresponds to the same person, these two papers are expected to share other coauthors either directly or by some other intermediate publications. On the other hand, if they are not written by the same person, their coauthor sets probably do not overlap or there are few paths linking them. Thus the first task is to retrieve all simple paths of length no greater than a certain threshold. Breadth-first search is a natural strategy to find out all loopless paths, however, in real case there is redun-dancy among some simple paths, and repeated contribution induced by them may arise. While searching, what GHOST needs to do is to discover the existence of a triangle-like ba-sic unit and check whether the longer sub-path is invalid or not. An invalid sub-path emerges if and only if two sets of three publication sets consist of only one identical publica-tion, as illustrated in Figure 1. If invalid paths are found, the longer one is considered to be redundant and would be eliminated in the process of searching.
All valid paths will be used to compute the similarity of the two nodes based on the following heuristics. (1)The shortest path is the most indicative one among all valid paths. (2)The more paths there exist between two nodes, the more  X  X imilar X  the two nodes may be. (3)The notion of  X  X ix degrees of separation X  unearths a relatively large proba-bility that every pair of authors would be connected to each other, even if they are different persons. It suggests that the contributions made by relatively long paths need to be weakened sharply. Suppose there are m ( i, j ) valid paths linking two nodes a i 0 and a j 0 ,andthelengthof n th path is l n , the similarity is computed according to the formula: Sim ( a i 0 ,a j 0 )=  X  1 / { and  X  =2 . 1.
We adopt a powerful new clustering algorithm called Affin-ity Propagation (AP for short) for GHOST. It was intro-duced in [1] based on the message-passing techniques from the perspective of max-sum algorithm in a factor graph. AP does not need the user to specify a fixed number of potential cluster centers in advance, but instead chooses to simulta-neously consider all data points as potential cluster centers. Two kinds of messages are exchanged between every pair of data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corre-sponding clusters gradually emerges in the process of itera-tion.
When we resolve a name and find that there is at least one direct coauthor shared by two distinct authors, any author with the name is referred to as a  X  dense author  X . For example, two different authors named  X  X ei Wang X  have coauthored with  X  X iawei Han X . To deal with the low per-formance caused by dense authors, user feedback is adopted to achieve enhancement. Three strategies are available to get a satisfactory performance as the responses to user feed-back. (1)Decrease the number of valid paths. (2)Increase the depth while searching for valid paths. (3)Adjust the value of  X  preferences  X  in the AP clustering process.
We conducted experiments on DBLP dataset, and the per-formance results on 10 authors are shown in Table 1. For the 9 sparse authors, no user feedback was adopted. But it was utilized to enhance the performance for a dense author,  X  X ei Wang X . We also compared GHOST with one of the state-of-the-art name distinction algorithms, DISTINCT presented in [3]. Five  X  X ough X  names were chosen to compare them. The f-score comparison results of the two algorithms are shown in Figure 2. We can see that for all these names, GHOST always outperforms DISTINCT.
In this paper, we have explored the problem of name distinction, and developed an effective five-step framework, GHOST, which employs only one type of relationship, namely, co-authorship. Experimental results show that GHOST can achieve both high precision and recall, and outperforms the-state-of-the-art approach, DISTINCT.
