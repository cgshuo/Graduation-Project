 This work describes a multi-year ethnography-for-design study in a dental hygiene training progr am in San Diego, USA. We performed an ethnographic analysis of instructional practices used in clinical instruction, a nd helped design a new training laboratory, equipped with digital media technology, through which students and instructor s could access a video blogging ( X  X logging X ) system. We present an analysis of how the vlogging system transformed social and instru ctional interactions in clinical training. Additionally, we describe how the faculty X  X  appropriation of vlog technology was initially challenged by the presentation of divergent methodology in vlog records, and increased transparency of teachi ng practices in video records.

Recent advances in multimedia technology now make it possible to incorporate capture and playback applications into high-activity, hands-on training contexts [1, 4, 13, 16]. While many promising educational applications are being created, there is very little research on how this technology affects learning and socialization; or more importan tly, how people develop practices around technologies and how they are adapted and incorporated into practices [8, 9]. To this end, we are investigating how  X  X logging X  systems affect the learning practices involved in training novice practitioners, and how integrating new technology alters the complex social dyna mics of professional training. Brown [5] draws on the metaphor of an ecology to describe an environment for learning. Brown says,  X  X n ecology is basically an open, complex adaptive system comprising elements that are dynamic and interdependent. One of the things that makes an ecology so powerful and adaptable to new contexts is its diversity. X  Brown further describes a learni ng ecology as,  X  X  collection of overlapping communities of interest (virtual), cross-pollinating with each other, constantly evolvi ng, and largely self-organizing. X  Brown X  X  ecology concept encourages the creation and delivery of a learning environment that pres ents a diversity of learning options to the student. This e nvironment offers students with opportunities to receive learning through methods and models that best support their needs, intere sts, and personal situations. A learning ecology also supports social learning. Brown [5] recommends offering technologies for students to form learning teams for collaborative activities, or to self-organize into discussion groups where students can explore learning topics. The landscape is complicated because both tacit knowledge and explicit dimensions of knowledge apply not only to the individual, but also to communities of practice [18]. Much of knowing is brought forth in action, action through participation, participation with the world, par ticipation with the lifeworld of the profession [11], and particip ation with other people, i.e., practices [15]. In sum, a learning ecology is an environment that dovetails with how learners learn. An ecology, as an open system, is dynamic and interdependent, dive rse, partially self-organizing, adaptive, and at times, fragile. In recent years, researchers have become increasingly aware of how the technological environment features in human cognition, action, learning processes, and social interaction [10-14]. A number of studies have looked into the role of tools and technologies in complex workplace environments [8, 13, 18, 20]. When investigating the impacts of educational technology, we can attend to multiple levels: such as, interface feat ures, usability, ergonomics, etc. However, it is im portant to recognize that (often) education takes place in complete, complex, and interactive environments, which include many individuals [2, 15]. Recent work from cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and the computer supported collabora tive work community indicates that we must be conscientious of broader settings and patterns of activity when investigating the impacts of technology [8, 14, 15]. The distributed cognition framework explicitly encompasses not only cognitive phenomena that might take place in the head (mental representations, human in formation processing), but also representations and phenomena that take place in the environment, and among people in a sociocultural system [15]. Designing for distributed cognitiv e systems requires a different framing of research, evaluation, and design methodologies than designing for single users. Briefly, the central challenge is that design decisions should consider not only individuals, but also systemic realities, e.g. social and institutional factors. Understanding how intelligence is distributed across a broader matrix of individuals in the world becomes increasingly critical if we want to understand how lear ning comes from being situated and participating in a community of practice. Learning a profession might be best thought about as enculturating into a community of practice; for instance, a community of physicians, lawyers, writers, pilots, etc. This research was conducted in a dental hygiene training program in San Diego, CA, USA. The pr ogram provides basic education and clinical experience to prepare graduates for licensure as dental hygienists. The students come from predominantly underrepresented, low-income co mmunities, and have varying levels of computer literacy. New students in the program take an introductory course in instrumentation skills where they learn how to use the basic set of peri odontal instruments. This course formed the central focus of our research. Training is done in a clinical laboratory with eighteen practice workstations. Each student is assigned a workstation, equipped with dental chair, overhead lamp, floating tray, polisher, etc. As beginners, the students do not yet work with human patients, but instead practice on mouth models. A dental hygiene school is a special kind of learning ecology. It is a vocational education program , which means that much of what is learned is job-related, practical, and specific to the profession. On the other ha nd, some of the educational component is conceptual, and is taught in  X  X ormal X  settings  X  that is, classrooms and lecture-style settings. However, workplace and professional specifications de fine the knowledge, skills, and performance students must accomplish to demonstrate proficiency in their professional role. As dent al hygiene is an institutionalized profession, students mu st pass formal licensing exams at both the state and national level. Theref ore, individual training programs maintain standards of what they teach, so that graduates are well prepared to pass licensing examinations. When designing educational technology, it is crucial to place high priority on developing technological support for the real-world activities learners engage in [14, 15]. Moreover, the members of a field site change social and institutional practices as they appropriate new technology into their workplace [8]. Consequently, we structured this study in two stages: the first priority was to gain an ethnographic understanding of the field site, looking deeply at teaching and learning practices, media and representations, social and institu tional structures, and practical concerns (e.g. financial and education level of participants); the second priority was an implementation and evaluation study of a design prototype, based on findings from the first stage. Figure 1 represents the time course of this research study as a spiral of iterative design, which is read st arting from the outside edges and moving clockwise inwards. Et hnographic methods were used during both phases of the study (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Ethnography-for-design , an iterative design process Decisions about the usefulness of a technology are socially constructed throughout the entire design and use cycles of a technology by the various actors who participate in the community of practice [8, 9]. Moreover, technology is not adopted at one point, followed by use; instead, the technology and the use context go through a process of mutual adjustment --appropriation. Appropriation is an interpretive process that emerges from the interactions among actors, technology, and social settings [9]. Studying the cultural processes behind appropriation can help us unders tand how to design technology that is more likely to be appropriated and effectively used by the community. We used a distributed cognition perspective to explore the processes behind technology appr opriation. In distributed cognition, cognitive processes extend across the traditional boundaries of the skin and the skull as various kinds of coordination are established and maintained between bodily and material resources [15]. Data from multimodal interaction provide us with information about the underlying cognitive architecture. Figure 1 represen ts multimodal interaction as a pyramid. The dotted lines representing the presence of other bodies that gesture, talk, and act, emphasize that multimodal interactions take place in social contexts within a shared world. Therefore, larger patterns, like social organization and the context of activity should be viewed as important parts of the underlying cognitive architecture of a system. Th is is especially important to clarify when framing the study educational settings: typically  X  X earning X  is viewed as a process that happens within the heads of individual learners, but within a distributed cognition perspective, social and collaborative processes, as well as interactions between the bod(ies) and the shared world, take on a central, rather than peripheral, role [15]. 
Figure 2. Multimodal interaction represented as a pyramid, interacting through talk and gesture, and (possibly) acting During the first phase, we perfo rmed extensive fieldwork, spending a year in the field site with the incoming class of students. We collected ethnographi c data in order to understand circumstances they typically encounter, and the sorts of tools and technologies they rely upon to accomplish their work. During this phase, eighteen students and four clinical instructors voluntarily participated. While in the field, we made detailed observations, recorded video (31 hours) of instructional episodes in the clinic, and held contextual interviews w ith all participants. Students were interviewed about how they studied course material and practiced instrumentation in clinic a nd at home. Instructors were interviewed about what representations they use and might use in the future (as a new teaching clinic was being built at the time). Some of the most significant findings from this stage of research were an analysis of the kinds of instructional strategies used in clinical instruction. Members of a profession are trained to be highly attuned to specific phenomena in their workplace environment, honing their percepti on to sense, classify events, and guide specific actions [11]. Since perception and action are tightly coupled [10], exploring domains where novices are taught to sense and execute institutionally relevant ways of moving their body in synchrony with the tools of the trade provides us with a deeper look into how expert practice develops. We identified several discursive practices used to scaffold and structure the actions of novices as they learn the tools and practices of the professional domain of dental hygien e. In brief, some of relevant action-scaffolding practices that we observed include: novice X  X  body into the configurations and movements of the profession. We saw instructor s physically lay their hands over students X  hands as student s worked with periodontal instruments. By molding student s X  hands and bodies, instructors give them the  X  X eel X  of what correct motion is like. new procedure. Instructors often used verbal cues in the imperative mode (i.e.  X  X o this, X  ) to guide the behavior of students as students worked firsthand with periodontal instruments. Frequently moldi ng and directing practices occur in synchrony. models of actions (situated in discourse). Instructors used pantomime gestures of instrume ntal action in order to convey correct, and incorrect, behaviors. Demonstrations are often exaggerated to emphasize specific representational features, and occur in a rich context of multimodal discourse. We based the design of instructi onal technology for the clinical training laboratory on an analysis of ethnographic data. Several results motivated the implementation of an initial prototype. In 2005, the program finished construction of a new clinical teaching laboratory that had eighteen individual practice workstations equipped with embedded comput er monitors, which were designed to show dental patient s their medical records. We opportunistically used the technology infrastructure in place, harnessing the workstation comput ers for instructional purposes (see Figure 3). The original plan was to implem ent a digital video recording and playback system. Video is a robust medium for showing instructional material, as much of what is learned in clinical training is motor-based, and not re presented well in static images or text. We envisioned running a digital video system of some kind that would allow students to record practice and view instructor demonstrations. We opt ed to implement digital video records on a vlog for several reasons. Once, using a vlog requires only basic Internet skills, rather than knowledge/training on specialized software (such as th e digital video program DIVER, created at the Center for Science of Learning and Instruction at Stanford University [20]. Because preliminary ethnographic fieldwork indicated the participant population of students and instructors had varying degrees of computer literacy and comfort with new technology, we wanted to choose a technology that was accessible to a wide user population. Furthermore, we were also told by the administration that the time required to train faculty and students on specialized comput er software was not available in the already impacted curriculu m. This being said, it is a good possibility that in other types of medical or dental training environments, where the time and resources exist, new technology that enables video editing and annotation, or can support split-screen viewing and comparison of novice and expert practice, may hold considerable promise. Therefore, we developed a vlogging system, which was prototyped in the incoming class in Fall 2005, and continued to be used in Fall 2006. The vlog format was chosen because it is flexible, accessible, capable of supporting a variety of media and annotations, and could be readily modified [1]. The vlog and accompanying digital video required only basic Internet skills to use, and it could be convenien tly viewed and controlled from practice workstations in the training clinic (see Figure 3 and 4), or off-site, such as in students X  homes. Blogging software was used to create the vlog, which was supported from our laboratory server at UC San Diego. Videos were created in Quicktime. Figure 3. Integrated computer hardware shown in grey . The vlog contained a variety of records. Each week, we recorded the program director demonstrati ng technique for the instruments being taught that week. Additionally, we recorded video clips of in-class demonstrations done by in structors during clinic sessions. On a weekly basis, these shor t (2-5 min.) video segments on relevant course material were posted to the vlog. Students and faculty had access to view video records and to add, edit, and read accompanying posts both in clinic and remotely. 
Figure 4. Students engaged in partner practice while using new technology: simultaneously viewing video on the vlog, practicing instrumentation, and conversing with partner. We examined how altering the  X  X echnology landscape X  of the training environment affected the network of social interactions and teaching/learning practices. This analysis was accomplished using ethnographic methods: par ticipant observation, video recording of technology use (13 hours), web-based surveys, server log data, and student/faculty interviews. Sixty-three students and five clinical instructor s participated in this phase of the research. Server log data from our lab server was captured from August 2005 through January 2007. Using standard UNIX commands we modified the log data to show onl y those requests for video files. We ignored visits to the vlog home page, because we thought that the requests for video files would better represent occasions when students were actively using the vl og (and by default, show visits to the vlog home page). Using Analog 6.0, and Analog Helper, a set of freeware software for serv er log files, we ran several analyses of the data, which are s hown and discussed in the results section. Sixty-three students and five clinical instructors were interviewed. Each student was formally inte rviewed once during the semester, though several informal contextual interviews [3] were also conducted as students worked. Th e five faculty members were interviewed several times (formally and informally) during the course of the semester. Holding interviews in the users' environment 'grounds' the interviews in surroundings and artifacts, making the discussions more concrete and uncovering factors such as routines, inte ractions with technology, and collaborations [3]. One of the original visions we had was that students could interactively use the vlog to pos t questions and comments about specific material. When the vlog was created we enabled features that would support commenting and discussion on post topics with associated video. For inst ance, if a student had a question about a particular post, they could attach a question and open a dialog with instructors or other stude nts. On the front page of the vlog, we posted a thorough descrip tion of how a student could log into the system in order to leave a comment or post a question. We also mentioned this when we introduced students to the technology and demonstrated how to use it at the beginning of the semester. However, aside from one isolated case, students did not use this commenting feature. (The case in question involved a discrepancy between what was s hown in the video did not match up with the textbook. In comment s, students noted this and debated about how to resolve the discrepancy by asking an instructor in the next session.) Therefore, though the system was designed as a video blog, in use it was more of a video repository of course-relevant material. Smyth and Beasley [25] report a similar result in a study they did on the usage of an online learning environment for engineering students. They found that although an asynchronous discussion forum was provided for students to ask subject-specific questions, and the purpose of the discussion boards was communicated to the students, it was never used. In surveys, students reported that they were aware of the system and they did know how to use it, but they preferred getting feedback face-to-face. Perhaps, in our case as well, lack of use has to do with the difficulties of translating image and dynamic information into writing? Another key reason mentioned by Smyth and Beasley is that it was because the academic staff did not actively integrate the discussion forum into the curriculu m. As many students tend to satisfy only the basic requireme nts for interacting with new technology [19] it is unlikely that students will participate in asynchronous discussion simply because a facility for this has been provided [25]. During the ethnographic phase of the research, we observed how instructors made use of a rich set of embodied representations (e.g. gesture and hands-on guidance) in conveying instrumentation practices to novices. Our goal in technology design was to augment or enhance the kinds of interactions that can take place in the clinical laboratory, not to replace the instructional practices integral to the training process with technological analogues. The vlog was designed to integrate with clinical training interactions already established, such as solo demonstrations. Within these activities, the vlog further supported novel interactions, described below. The flat-panel monitors were located on swivel arms that could be positioned in alignment with stude nts X  hands as they worked on mouth models (see Figure 3). This configuration allowed students to view expert demonstrations while simultaneously modeling those motions with their own instruments and mouth models. Students were able to make visual comparisons between themselves and the experts onscreen because all the video records were filmed with the camera positioned in a  X  X irst-person X  viewpoint (i.e. from the perspectiv e one would have if they were watching their own hands). This was a design decision supported by research on motor learning from video [16], as well as ethnographic data where we obs erved students modeling their actions after instructors X  dem onstrations. However, unlike live instruction, with digital video the student is able to maintain control over the pace of information flow, and is able to freely pause, rewind, and review demonstrations. For the first time, students c ould make simultaneous visual comparisons between their ow n bodies and hands and the instructor X  X  onscreen, as facilitated by the video being framed from a  X  X irst-person X  perspective. Motor learning literature reports on the value of modeling when learning motor tasks, but all the evidence is from a paradigm where the task is modeled and viewed by a subject prior to a subject X  X  re-enaction [23]. Little experimental evidence exists on the effects of concurrently  X  X ollowing X  the actions of a live or video model, where periodic visual comparisons can be pe rformed, versus watching the demonstration prior to practici ng [23]. Indeed, there is much research to be done on how video supports various aspects of the learning process, including suppor ting context, which will be discussed in section 3.1.2. In addition, in a clinic rife with distractions, the vlog may provide students with a structure to serve as a locus of activity. The clinical space is open, noisy, and chaotic  X  eighteen students and four instructors are performing a variety of learning tasks, and opportunities for deep engageme nt and reflection. Videos appeared to provide students with a point of focus, a meaningful representation to attend to and reflect on for long stretches of time. A new kind of interaction happens when a student practices instrumentation by following along with the video, guided by the physical demonstration and the verbal directions. In contrast to our initial presuppositions, we noted that students often preferred to watch video segm ents while working in dyads. As they watched the video, part ners often conversed with each other about topics currently being modeled or discussed simultaneously on the video. T hus, during partner collaboration, the video supported a context of relevant speech and demonstrations that the stude nts could view together and comment upon. Example LATERAL (represen ted as contiguous cartoon 1 in Figures 5-7) shows an example from our digital video data of the context-supporting function of th e vlog. In the example, two students are shown --SL ( S tudent on the L eft) and SR ( S tudent on the R ight) --viewing a video se lection on scaling from the vlog. In Figure 5, after the video track says,  X ...create lateral pressure against the tooth, X  SL turns to SR and asks,  X  X id she say lateral? X  Prompted by the video X  X  mention of the technical term  X  lateral , SL turns to her partner for clarification. The viewing of the video blog is not a passive activity. Often, students are actively engaged w ith the material world while viewing. Furthermore, students working together can employ a variety of multimodal resources to interact with each other as a video is played, such as speech and non-speech sounds, gesture, eye gaze, and body position. The video establishes a contextual backdrop upon which a discussion can take place. Indeed, as seen in Figure 6, SR not only responds affirmatively to SL X  X  question about whether the instructor on the video said  X  X ateral, X  but she also begins to elaborate on what that term means by instantiating it in real-time activity with her instruments. In Cartoon style line drawings were rendered directly from frame grabs of digital video data.  X  Lateral X  refers to a horizontal force that is applied as a scaling instrument is moved up a toot h, which is necessary for removing tartar deposits. This is similar to the horizontally directed pressure that must be applied in order to remove paint from a wall with a scraper. fact, SR responds as though SL had made an implicit request (i.e. What does lateral mean when we are scaling?). Beginning with,  X  X o you, X  SR turns her gaze downwards, to her hands. As SR shifts her gaze, and SL follows, the locus of attention moves from the screen to SR X  X  hands in the participation framework [11] formed by the screen and the two students. In Figure 7, SR elaborates on the meaning of lateral by instantiating it in instrumental action. It is interesting that she chooses to instantiate  X  X ateral X  pr essure in relevant instrumental action as opposed to defining it in abstract terms, or through a description of forces applied through the instrument via the body. SR simultaneously twists the inst rument between her fingers as the says,  X  X oll the tip, X  and then pushes on the instrument shank after she says,  X  X ush it X . Note how SR even uses the vernacular verb  X  X ush X  to describe what sh e does to the instrument, instead of the member term  X  X ateral pressure, X  which further builds a semiotic bridge between instrumental action  X  everyday speech terms  X  technical terms. This developmental trajectory is similar to that described by Roth a nd Welzel in how students learn scientific discourse from hands-on physics laboratory exercises [21]. In the LATERAL example, we ha ve seen how the video provides information content at a particular time that participants can reference, incorporating it into the dialog by indexing with speech or gesture to augment their commentary. The video on the vlog provides students with a  X  X ommon ground X  of reference [6] that they can use while developing skills. The social science concept of 'common ground' refers to what people seek to achieve in collaborative activity in order to coor dinate what it is that they are attending to and/or communica ting about. In educational research, the concept of common ground is often used to look at collaborative discourse, gesture, participation frameworks and joint visual attention (e.g., [2, 16]. Achieving common ground  X  the ability perceive relevant entities in a professional domain and act in expert ways  X  may be essential to the success of professional education. Goodwin reminds us that our power to say something relevant and consequential resides not within ourselves alone, but instead is embedded within a social ecology of meaning making practices organized through ongoing processes of human interaction [11]. He describes how an aphasic man has the ability to use the talk of family members to formulate the details of what he wants to say even though he can say only three words: "yes," "no," and "and." His utterances and gestural displa ys interpolate within temporal organization of the ongoing talk of others, and derive meaningful coherence by nature of the juxt aposition. In an analogous scheme, the students here rely upon the ongoing narrative in the video in order to ground utterances and gestural displays within a fertile loam. The students' actions and speech are aimed at aligning intersubjective understanding of vide o content. By exploiting the unfolding narrative sequence in the ongoing video, students are able to anchor interactions within a rich conceptual context. In a sense, the video  X  X caffolds X  collaborative discussion between novices. As the head instructor eloquently put it, in an interview done in 2006,  X  X he vlog would give them words to express what they're challenged with. X  Presumably, though, students may not be attending to the video during the times that their attention is directed to each other and a conversation unfolds. However, a benefit of having digital video in a Quicktime movie player is that it can be easily rewound and replayed. Even if a segment of video is missed while students are focusing on dialog with each other, the missed segment can be revisited. During group work when an instructor is present, instructors often 'highlight,' or indicate relevant features of a video with speech &amp; gesture during group viewing. This may support a developing  X  X rofessional vision X  X  seeing the wo rld as an expert does [11]. The screens serve as a dynamically changing representation to which joint attention is focused. In Example LATERAL, we saw the video blog play an important role in a system formed by two students working together. The vlog guided their activity in certain ways, for instance, providing a focal point to focus shared attention, and a context of relevant discourse upon which stude nts could layer their talk and action. In Example GROUP, we see a similar phenomena occurring; this time with a small group of five students and an instructor. In Example GROUP (Figure 8), the instructor has gathered a group of students around one student  X  X  workstation. Prior to when the data recording begins, the instructor has been demonstrating to the group how to use the Gracey 13/14, a scaling instrument. The instructor still s its at the student X  X  chair, and holds the instrument in her right hand. Following her  X  X ive X  demonstration, she chooses a vi deo from the vlog that discusses the Gracey 13/14, and plays it as the group looks on. After the video plays for a few minutes, the instructor lifts her instrument up at her eye level and says,  X  X ee how she really over-angulates? X  As she says,  X  X ver-angulates 3 , X  the instructor bobs the instrument handle in the air while rotating it counter-clockwise. Prompted by the video display, the instructor highlights a feature of instrumental action onscreen to the group [11]. She accomplishes this by positioning her body in a representational framework where her hand and instrument aligns with the instrument and model onscreen (from her perspective). Her utterance,  X  X ee how, X  effectively moves the locus of attention of the group from the screen to her hands (note the shift in gaze of the student across from the instructor), but the alignment of the gesture with the structure onscreen makes it clear to what she is referring. Held up in the air, and exaggerated in motion, the instructor X  X  gesture with the instrument guides the developing professional vision of he r students, instructing them about what is meaningful about what they see onscreen. Here, in the context of professional training, the attention of the student group is overseen by the instructor. Schegloff [22] argues that intersubjectivity is locally managed. Moreover, he also argues that it is  X  X nteractional and sequential. X  Schegloff refers to purely spoken interaction, whereas what we are talking about here is the full repertoire of embodi ed conduct in the presence of a material world [12, 13]. What we see in Example GROUP is another example of the  X  X ontext-supporting X  property of the vlog. The instructor is able to "say more than she is saying" by her points and references to the ongoing video. However, in th is case, the students have the additional benefit of having an expert commentator who provides a meta-level analysis of the practices shown onscreen. The video supports a context upon which an instructor X  X  gestures and speech can be layered in order to augment the content and present new strategies for seeing practice expe rtly. As phrased by Goodwin [11], the instructor constructs  X  X  multimodal sign complex (language + gesture + things), in which structurally different kinds of signs in different media mutually elaborate each other to create a whole that is both different from, and greater than, any of its constituent parts. X  Moreover, motor learning research has shown that video replays are more successful in the teaching of motor skills when accompanied by cues or directions from experts, such as experiments where subjects are explicitly taught to focus on certain aspects of the display during video replay [16]. What the instructors are doing in real-time here is a similar practice to that which the DIVER system created by Roy Pea X  X  research group at Stanford Univer sity attempts to encapsulate through facilities for digital video annotation (see [20]). This software system allows experts to augment videos by creating annotations that show  X  X hat th ey are seeing X  or  X  X hat is important X  about a particular scene. Moreover, they are not only teaching students how to see, but also where to go to find answers should they need them reviewed (an activity supported by the archival status and wide accessibility of the vlog). Interestingly, the instructors ofte n repurposed the videos to show a subtlety of scaling that was not being explicitly discussed on the The verb angulate refers to the angle that the instrument blade makes with the surface of the tooth, which can be controlled by adjusting the handle of the instrument.  X  Over - X  refers to an exaggerated angle. video; for instance, where the instructor onscreen has positioned the handle of a particular instrument in three-dimensional space. The video provides a contextual backdrop that the instructors can augment with gestures and talk. Decisions about the usefulness of a technology are socially constructed during the design and use cycles [8]. This is a joint project done by all the actors who participate in the community of practice. Also, technology is not adopted at one discrete point in time; rather, the technology and context go through a process of mutual adjustment  X  appropriation [8 ]. We looked at some of the larger political issues that came up during the appropriation of the vlogging system. These issues seem to fall into two interrelated categories: build practices around it, the vlog. One of the barriers that instructors faced when appropriating the video blogging system was in deve loping ways of teaching that incorporated the vlog. Moreover, instructors were faced with the burden of having to learn how to use the blogging technology, and then teach students how to use it. Contrary to the authors X  original assumptions when envi sioning and designing the system for implementation, many of the instructors and students in the program were not familiar with video blogs nor had engaged in the practice of blogging. This came as a surprise to us as one of the reasons we had chosen a vlog format was because we thought it would be familiar to the user population and not require much additional training to use. On th e contrary, we were often called upon to provide technical expertise while engaging in fieldwork. This unfamiliarity provided an inte resting barrier to usage of the system. For instance, in a post-semester interview in 2005, the head instructor mentioned:  X  X s far as the video blogs, well t hat was definitely new for all of us faculty...and I think a lot of us, you know, would kinda forget how to use it, or don X  X  don X  X  haven  X  X  used it enough, so that every time I go to open up the vlog, I X  X  kinda confused. X  Nevertheless, despite the barrier s to integrating the vlog into instructional practices, the vlog was used during 2005. Figure 9 shows server log data recorded during the fall semester of 2005 and 2006, indicating the average number of requests for video files from the blog site, grouped per day of the week. The data shows that the vlog was accessed most frequently during clinical meeting times (Tuesday/Thursday), followed by evenings that preceded class times. Similar usage trends were present both years. In 2005, our observations showed that the students X  use of the vlog appeared to be student-drive n; that is, by students seeing each other use the system in the clinic, in contrast to having instructors explicitly create assignments or learning activities that would incorporate the vlog, or directly telling students to use it, as only one of the four clinical inst ructors actively promoted its use. It was not until 2006, the second year that the blog was used, that instructors began to embrace teaching practices that explicitly called upon using the vlog. For instance, as the head instructor reported in an interview done in 2006,  X  X e have them (students) bring them (videos) up so that they can watch things that we're teaching. A lot of times we make that part of our instruction is to watch the blog... X  Another classroom practice was to assign the viewing of specific sections of the vlog to students who had particular problems that she had noticed and diagnosed. In an interview done with the head instructor in 2006,  X  X hen we can come over see where they are, or what they're following with the blog, or if we feel like maybe they should watch another part of the blog, for the same instrument maybe on the posterior, or something. X  And as another one of the c linical instructors describes:  X  X nd um, or if they weren't using the blog, they were doing something else, and we'd get over there and say,  X  X ell, pull the will help you to do it right, X  especially if you catch something that you know is discussed on the blog. X  Interestingly, we saw an increase in vlog usage accompanying the development of teaching practices incorporating the vlog. Figure 9 shows that the vlog was used almost twice as much in 2006 than in 2005, possibly due to instructors actively promoting its use in clinic. Professional hygienists, when working in a dental office, often use a diverse set of instrumentati on practices. Hygienists evolve their own personal style through years of practice. However, instructors in the dental hygiene program report that a lack of consistency in taught technique is a challenge for novices. Therefore instructors in the program strive for  X  X alibration X  of the practices that they teach. Some material on the vlog showed instrumentation technique and style that differed slightly from the head instructor X  X  and the textbook. As a result, the head inst ructor had very neutral feelings about the vlog: she allowed students to use it in class, but did not promote or encourage its use. In interviews she was very critical of the technology. As stated by the head instructor in 2005:  X  X  felt sometimes that the video blog actually caused some confusion, 'cause it was teaching a whole different way, so it was like having another faculty in there with different ideas. X  Of course the vlog itself was not teaching with  X  X ifferent ideas; X  it does not speak or teach itself. Really the  X  X ifferent ideas X  are those of the director of the dental hygiene program, who is represented in the content on the filmed video demonstrations. This points to a bigger issue about power  X  who makes the decisions about pedagogical content? Who has the right to  X  X peak X  in videos, and whose way of teaching gets archived and reproduced? Prior to the introduction of the video blogging system, the level of description that students/faculty could access was oral or ephemeral (somewhat like an oral tradition in nonliterate cultures). Furthermore, several descriptions in the textbook were suitably abstract to warrant multiple interpretations, in contrast to the video records provided on the vlog. For the first time, once the vlog was introduced, faculty members could watch each other X  X  practice. Differences became clear, and instructors were forced to address how they were going to d eal with these differences. As the head instructor reported in 2006:  X  X  think we were affected by the blog and maybe questioned some of our teaching, uh instruction...and so by looking at the vlog, we see maybe there's a better way to teach instrumentation, and have the greater variety supported, but have everyone on the same page. X  What she is referring to is a new practice that the program developed: teaching (few) multiple ways of doing a technique to all students, but being clear about what those multiple ways are. The vlog was appropriated as a way for faculty to share technique --a calibration tool for instructors. In an interview done with two of the instructors, HI (head instructor) and CI (clinical instructor), the following discussion resulted: HI: There's always a lot of things we all need to know and have familiarity with before we start teaching. CI: The calibration is always a challenge. HI: It is. Especially in this course. So every week now we get together, watch the blog entries for that week, figure out what things to refer to in the blog, get the books together, we all get out our instruments and mouth models so that we can practice together how we're gonna show the students. I think having everybody up on those blogs is huge, too, so that we can be in agreement on everything.
 In the context of discussing the importance of calibration, the head instructor mentions how the viewing of videos on the vlog served as a mechanism for maintaining a calibrated way of teaching. The sense of what  X  X alibration X  means seemed to shift too ~ no longer did it simply mean to teach the same thing the same way, but that a few diverse practices, explicitly spelled out, were acceptable. And it X  X  possible that part of the higher level of vlog usage seen in 2006 compared to 2005 is due to the resolution of some of the conflicts in instructor calibration. Additionally, more hits may have been logged because instruct ors were using the videos as part of calibration exercises. This paper has described the e volving dynamics of a learning ecology. We have focused on the way that introducing new instructional media caused a perturbation in the ecology, and how the practitioners navigated that perturbation, returning back to a state of  X  X ower energy. X  Th is trajectory, though seemingly subdivided into neat divisions of technology design, and intervention, gives a false sense of the complexity of what really went on. Indeed, the standard separation between design and use, although sometimes methodologically useful, can create an unrealistic view of the process of design and introduction of an innovation into a sociohistorical context of use [8]. In this case, the process of technology appropriation was much more inconstant, sporadic, and involve d several complex variables, especially because we used a methodological framework involving participatory design. At several points, technology appropriation involved a negotiation between technological features and social practices. During the preliminary ethnographic phase of the research, we observed how instructors made use of a rich set of embodied representations (such as guidan ce activities and demonstrations) to convey instrumentation practices to students. We designed a vlogging system that would integrate with clinical training interactions already in place, such as solo practice, partner practice, and faculty-guided group demonstrations. Based on analysis of digital video data taken while practitioners worked with the vlog in clinical practice, we identified three new classes of activity that practitioners developed appropriating the vlog: instrumentation while simulta neously watching videos. The video content on the vlog was filmed from a  X  X irst-person X  perspective, allowing students to make visual comparisons between themselves and the expert onscreen. Based on survey data, this appeared to be an important activity for students in both 2005 and 2006. supported a context of relevant speech and demonstrations that the students could view together and comment upon. As stated in an interview with the head instructor in 2006, the vlog would  X  X ive them words to express what they're challenged with. X  instructor is present, instructors often highlight [10], or indicate relevant features of a video with speech and gesture during group viewing. This may support the development of  X  X rofessional vision X  X  seeing the world as an expert does. DePaula [8] defines design as a process of translation, or interpretation, between different social groups: designers and a network of participants in field settings. He points to the challenges inherent in translating different actors X  needs and values, as different interpretations of comple x settings coexist. Participants must create systems of meaning and practices for making use of technology in order to accept it. Reports from 2006 show that faculty integrated vlog technology to a much greater extent than in 2005, as evidenced by web server logs (Figure 9), observations, and post-semester interviews. Se veral instructors who did not promote technology in 2005 integrated video viewing into their teaching practices. Based on interviews, it appears that two main reasons explain this shift in technology valuation: recognizing how features of the system could be integrated into teaching practices, and interviews, instructors mentioned recommending specific portions of the vlog to students to watch at home, or noting what sections students had viewed in order to make recommendations. Though neutral in its composition, when technology is implemented in institutional settings, it has social and political consequences. Regardless of de sign features, a technology X  X  perceived usefulness is constructed in the complex context it is implemented within [8, 9, 15]. We were struck by how our field site community differed from pr ototypical university student populations and/or the user test beds often drawn upon in conventional usability studies. We were able to leverage a background knowledge obtained through ethnographic research in this domain as a means to maximize the chances of successful implementation. For instance, what looked like an initial ambivalence, or distrust, of the vlogging system eventually resulted in a more widespread acceptance of the technology, as instructors became empowered to make decisions about how video material would integrate into what they taught, and as they became familiar with the system. Short-term field-testing would not have enabled us to observe this process. For instance, following initial reluctance or ambivalence, instructors began to create their own novel methods for incorporating use of the vlog into teaching practices. Also, through exposure, they became more familiar with the medium of the blog. Furthermore, the availability of videos on the blog revealed inconsistencies in the c ontent of what was being taught. Though presumably such incons istencies existed prior to technology implementation, the natu re of available media allowed the lack of calibration to remain hidden from scrutiny. To some extent, inconsistencies were s uppressed. Prior to the video blogging system, the representations that faculty possessed and had access to were oral and ephemeral (like an oral tradition in non-literate cultures). Moreover, several descriptions in the textbook are suitably abstracted to warrant multiple interpretations (for instance, textual descriptions of bodily positioning or movements). In contrast, the video records provided on the vlog are situated, concrete, and preserve fine-grained details of human activity. As such, the videos were a new kind of representation that revealed details not quite so obvious in the past. For the first time, faculty members could watch each other X  X  practice. Differences became pointedly clear. Not surprisingly, when this lack of calibration became apparent, conflict arose. This  X  X igh energy state X  was relaxed when the instructors reconfigured their practices  X  for instance, by making agreements about representing a small set of diverse options, address this in a unified manner, and even using the segments present on the vlog as a means to achieve such unification. Brown [5] claims that one of the things that makes a learning ecology so powerful and adaptable to new contexts is diversity. Diversity helps to create the texture of knowledge assets and also enables it to be used in ways that might never have been originally imagined. Moreover, the knowledge of a learning ecology is more than static content. It's in a dynamic, living, and evolving state of flux. The findings from this research project include a deeper understanding of how vlogging technol ogy impacts the social and educational processes engaged in a hands-on training program for clinical instruction in dental hy giene. Digital video records of community practices bear great promise as an effective means for representing multiple strategies of accomplishing professional tasks, provided that such technology integrates into the social and cultural systems in place or being created in a community of practice. Vlogging technology has pot ential application in a wide variety of professional training domains, especially medical domains such as surgery, dentistry, and nursing.
