 As an interactive intelligent system, recommender systems are developed to give recommendations that match users X  preferences. Since the emergence of recommender systems, a large majority of research focuses on objective accuracy criteria and less attention has been paid to how users interact with the system and the efficacy of interface designs from users X  perspectives. The field has reached a point where it is ready to look beyond algorithms, into users X  interactions, decision making processes, and overall experience. Foll owing from the success of the joint IntRS 2014 workshop and previous workshops on Interfaces and Decisions in Recommender Systems, this workshop will focus on the aspect of integrating different theories of human decision making into the construction of re commender systems. It will focus particularly on the impact of interfaces on decision support and overall satisfaction, and on ways to compare and evaluate novel techniques and applications in this area.

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners around the topics of designing and evaluating novel intelligent interfaces for recommender systems in order to: (1) share research and techniques, including new design technologies and evaluation methodologies (2) identify next key challenges in the area, and (3) identify e merging topics. This workshop aims at establishing an interdisciplinary community with a focus on the interface design issues for recommender systems and promoting the collaboration opportunities between researchers and practitioners. We particularly encou rage demos and mock-ups of systems to be used as a basis of a lively and interactive discussion in the workshop This workshop is a follow up on five previous successful workshops at RecSys: http://recex.ist.tugraz.at:8080/RecSysWorkshop2011 https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/n.tintarev/pages/InterfaceRS/ The following list outlines core topics of interest . User Interfaces Interaction, user modeling and decision -making Evaluation The workshop format consists of a short general introduction to the workshop themes by the organizers. This is to be followed by oral presentation of accepted papers listed at the link below. Presentations will be grouped i nto sessions based on the subthemes of the workshop. One keynote presentation will be given. After each presentation and session, time will be allocated for general discussion and feedback. The workshop material including list of accepted papers, invited talk and workshop schedule are ava ilable at the IntRS@RecSys 2015 webpage: http://intrs.ist.tugraz.at/intrs/ and via the workshops section on the main conference website: http:/ /recsys.acm.org/recsys15/intrs/
