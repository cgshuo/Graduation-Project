 Consumer generated media (CGM), such as microblogs and SNS, through which users publish information are rapidly becoming popular on the Internet. Al-though a large amount of information about user experience is accumulated in CGM, developing technology to organize and utilize the stored information has not been progressing quickly enough.
 Twitter is a typical microblogging service that has two particular features: The first one is that users can freely post information on their experiences in real time. The second one is the length limitation, i.e., a tweet must be less than 140 characters. These features make that many users tweet their experience fragmentally and in real time. For examp le, many users tweet their impression of visiting sightseeing spots with photographs shot around there; each tweet is just a piece of information about the whole sightseeing experience.

Developing technology for organizing, storing, searching, and sharing experi-ences posted on Twitter becomes one of the key challenges. Many users have come to post information on their experiences mainly to Twitter, and they of-ten do not repost what they have tweeted to blog and SNS diary service again. This circumstance make it difficult to sha re the whole user experience because it is published in a fragment manner. In addition, although a certain experience is often described in many tweets, thes e tweets do not contain keywords that directly express it. As a result, even if one wants to find tweets about a sight-seeing experience, conventional keyw ord-based methods are not enough to find all target tweets without omissions; i.e., the recall is poor.

In this paper, we propose a novel method of organizing tweets that describe sightseeing experiences to help users organ ize, share and store their experiences. To this, we estimate the relatedness relationship of a tweet with the given sight-seeing experience, and its sharability value to store and share with others.
We label a sightseeing experience as a s equence of spot names. For example, when a user visits Kyoto, s/he may visit famous spots such as Yasaka-jinja, Kodai-ji, and Kiyomizu-dera. In this ca se, we label this sightseeing experience as a sequence of spot names,  X  X asaka-jinja, Kodai-ji, Kiyomizu-dera X . Given the label of a user X  X  sightseeing experience (a series of spot names) and the tweet archive of that user 1 , to find the tweets describing t his experience, we estimate the relatedness of a tweet with that sigh tseeing experience from the following two aspects.  X  Content relatedness  X  Context relatedness
On the other hand, we notice that many tweets posted during a sightseeing event have little worth to share with other people although they are related to that experience. For example, a user may just tweet information about his/her current location such as  X  X  X  X  at Kyoto station X . Although this tweet is related to his/her sightseeing in Kyoto, it has little worth to share with other people in most cases. Therefore, we propose a novel notion called sharability to estimate whether a sightseeing tweet is worth sharing. Currently, we compute the sharability of a sightseeing tweet by considering its content quality with linguistic and media features.

The input of our method includes 1) the label of sightseeing experience, which is a sequence of spots the user visited, 2) the sightseeing period, and 3) the tweet id of the user who want to organize his/her sightseeing tweets. At first, we use the user id and time period to collect the candidate tweets, and then rank and filter them by using the relatedness and sharability criteria. The output is a sequence of tweets describing the experi ence with the high value of storing and sharing with other people.

The major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.  X  We propose a novel method for organizing fragmented information (tweets)  X  We propose a novel notion called sharability to discover meaningful and  X  We carried out experiments to evaluate the efficiency of our method for There are much research on Twitter in recent years. Fujisaka et al. propose a method of estimating the regions of influence of social events found from geo-tagged tweets[1]. Wu et al. investigate how information is propagated from celebrities and bloggers to or dinary users[2]. Castillo et al. propose automatic methods of assessing credibility of tweets based on features of user behaviors[3]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few studies on mining and organizing user experiences from tweets. Arimitsu et al. and Hasegawa et al. propose methods of searching user experiences[8][12]. They define user experi-ences as several actions carried out in a particular sequence. In contrast, we discover more valuable information to share with other people by considering the sharing worth of tweets.

Many researchers focus on mining user experiences from blog entries and lifelog [4][5]. Kurashima et al. propose a method of extracting rules between five attributes of a person X  X  experience[4], i.e., time, location, activity, opinion, and emotion, from a large set of blog en tries. Their method focuses on how to mine frequent patterns from user experie nces. In contrast, our method mines and organizes the sightseeing experiences of each user. We also consider the worth for sharing with other people to organize fragmental information.

Several methods of discovering geogra phical topics have been proposed. Yin et al. propose a method of discovering geographical topics from geo-tagged photos in Flickr by using Latent Geographical Topic Analysis (LGTA), which com-bines location-driven and text-driven models[6]. Hong et al. propose a more accurate method of discovering geographical topics from geo-tagged tweets[7]. GPS-associated informat ion is necessary in these methods; however, only 0.77% of tweets are geo-tagged in Twitter 2 .

Data quality is an important issue in big data era[9]. Agichtein et al. [10] propose a method of automatically identifying high-quality content from Ya-hoo! Answers by considering intrinsic content quality, user relationships, and usage statistics. For intrinsic content quality, they use semantic features, such as punctuation density, capitalization errors, number of words, and distribution of word n-grams and part-of-speech sequen ces. Iwaki et al. propose a method of ex-tracting  X  X ersuasive X  images in a collection of regional photos on the Web[11]. They formulate persuasiveness with appr oximate subject goodness estimated from Web 2.0 content and with a previously proposed method of photo quality assessment. Our notion of sharability is related to content quality. However, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt at computing the sharing worth of tweets. 3.1 Content Relatedness We utilize the co-occurrence relationship to estimate the content relatedness of a candidate tweet and a certain sightseei ng experience. It is based on the idea that if a tweet containing more words r elated to a spot, it has high probabil-ity of describing that spot. Usually, two terms having a strong co-occurrence relationship means they are strongly related to each other because they appear together often. Currently, we apply the method proposed by Hasegawa et al. [12] to construct a co-occurrence dictionary to support this task.

The content relatedness of tweet t i to sightseeing experience E =( p 1 ,  X  X  X  ,p n ) is defined as follows. Here, E is a series of location names where the user visited. where w 1 ,  X  X  X  ,w m are the keywords appearing in tweet t i ,and  X  is a parameter to prevent the content relatedness score from becoming 0 when we cannot find proper co-occurrence relationships by using the dictionary which may not cover all related words. co ( p j ,w k ) denotes the co-occurrence relationship of words p j and w k , and is specified in the co-occurrence dictionary. 3.2 Context Relatedness InTwitter,informationonanexperiencemaybedescribedinmanytweetsand a certain topic may be divided into a series of tweets due to the 140 characters limitation. As a result, a tweet may not contain words directly related to the sightseeing experience, although it is a p art of the description. In such case, one of the considerable solutions is to consider the effect of surrounding tweets. Intu-itively, because a sightseeing experience exhibits the continuity of user behaviors and tweets are posted in real time, surrounding tweets may describe the same experiences.

By considering the effect of preceding and following X tweets, the context relatedness score of tweet t i , Rx ( t i ), is calculated as follows. where time ( t i ) is the publishing time of the i-th candidate tweet t i in time order.  X  i + x is the weighting representing the temporal continuity calculated by applying the exponential degradation model [13][14].  X  t is a parameter for determining the rate in degradation of the similarity of content with increasing time intervals. After we select the sightseeing tweets wit h high relatedness scores, the next step is to determine their worth for sharing and storing. As we mentioned above, there are many sightseeing tweets that only provide information of the user X  X  current location (e.g.,  X  X  X  X  at Kyoto now X ), daily behavior (e.g.,  X  X unch time! X ), and so on. To discover tweets containing valuable information, we propose a novel notion of content sharability.

Generally, the sharability of a tweet can be estimated from three aspects such as 1) content quality, 2) social supp ort from other users (e.g., frequency of retweets), and 3) authority of the Twitter user (e.g., the tweets written by a famous person may have high sharability). However, because we currently focus on organizing a user X  X  own sights eeing experiences, authority is not a valid measure (the author is the user himself/herself!). Also, because social support depends on the online social network of that user and is the measure based on other users X  viewpoint, it is more useful when a user want to search for another one X  X  experience rather than organizing e xperiences of herself/himself. Hence, in this paper, we focus on the way of estimating sharability of a tweet from the aspect of content quality.

We assume that more informative and impressive tweets have high worth to share. In other words, we assume that a tweet containing many descriptive words and multimedia contents is informative; a tweet with emotional words is impres-sive. Currently, we compute the content sharability by considering linguistic and media features of tweets. Intuitively, fr om the linguistic aspect, the more descrip-tive and emotional words a tweet contains, the more sharing worth it has. On the other hand, from the media aspect, a tweet containing multimedia content, such as pictures and videos, will be assigned a higher content sharability score. The content sharability S ( t i ) of tweet t i is defined as follows. where modifier ( t i ) is the total number of adjectives, adjective verbs, adverbs, and adnominal adjectives in tweet t i ,and other ( t i ) is the number of the other words in t i . As mentioned before, we assume that a tweet consisting of more adjectives, adjective verbs, adverbs, and nominal adjectives are more impressive, and long tweets are more informative.  X  ( &gt; 1) is a weighting parameter to increase the importance of these types of words. Currently, we use the Japanese linguistic tool MeCab 3 to identify these types of words. pic ( t i ) is the number of URLs of pictures and videos attached to tweet t i . We empirically count a picture (video) as  X  words to simplify the computation. This is based on the assumption that a tweet with a picture (video) is more impressive and informative. We carried out three experiments to eva luate the efficiency our method: 1) ex-periment on relatedness, 2) experiment on content sharability, and 3) experiment on organizing tweets. 5.1 Experimental Method We focused on the sightseeing experience in Kyoto as our experimental target because Kyoto is the most famous sights eeing city in Japan. In our experiments, we used the names of sightseeing spots in Kyoto as keywords to collect tweets to build the co-occurrence dictionary. We used MeCab as the Japanese morpho-logical tool to extract keywords and spots names from the tweets.

We used the sightseeing spots X  names (Yasaka-jinja, Kiyomizu-dera, etc.) to find the Twitter users who have been to Kyoto. Finally, we randomly selected three users U a , U b and U c , and their one-day sightseeing experiences E a , E b ,and E c as our test targets. We respectively co llected these three user X  X  tweets posted in a week (the day s/he visited Kyoto and three days before/after that day) as the test data.

Based on the preliminary experimental results, the parameters are specified as follows:  X  =0 . 01 (the parameter for calculating the content relatedness score in Eq. (1)), and  X  =50 , X  =0 . 1 , X  = 5 (the parameter for calculating the content sharability score in Eq. (4), (5)).

We used the results of morphological analysis from MeCab to count the num-ber of words in tweets and identify adj ectives, adjective verbs, adverbs, and nominal adjectives. To calculate pic ( t i ), the number of pictures of tweet t i ,we assumed that if a tweet, except official r etweets, has one URL, one picture or video is attached in that tweet.
We used recall, precision, a nd F-measure as the evaluaion measures. We com-puted the scores by using our method for the tweets on each user experience ( E a , E b ,and E c ). If a tweet X  X  score is higher than the threshold, we regard it as one of the results returned by our method. We also manually evaluated the relatedness and sharing worth of each candidate tweet with the five-point scale method to construct the relevant result sets.

Each candidate tweet was manually rank ed into one of five categories based on two aspects respectively; whether each tweet is related to the target sightseeing experience and each tweet is worth sharing, where 5 means excellent relatedness (sharing worth) and 1 denotes poor relatedness (sharing worth). 5.2 Experiment on Relatedness We selected the tweets that manually sc ored greater than 4 as relevant re-sults. We used the results from the keyword-based OR search  X  X asaka-jinja or Kiyomizu-dera X  as the baseline method.  X  X asaka-jinja, Kiyomizu-dera X  is the sequence of spot names indicates our target sightseeing experience.
 Table 1, Figure 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c) su mmarize the experimental results.
As shown in Table 1, compared to the baseline method, the proposed method by considering content relatedness im proved the F-measure by an average of three times, and that by context relat edness improved it by an average of four times. Also, in our experiment, when X =2 , X  t = 10, our context relatedness based method achieved the best performance.

Fig. 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c) are the precision-recall curves of the four methods for each sightseeing experience.

The F-measure of context relatedness Rx ( t i ) was on average 20 percent higher than that of content relatedness Rc ( t i ).The precision ratio of Rx ( t i ) was higher than that of Rc ( t i ) when the recall ratio was higher than about 0.4 for all the sightseeing experiences.

These results indicated that using cont ent and context relatedness can improve efficiency of discovering tweets related t o a certain sightseeing experience. These results also revealed the importance of considering surrounding tweets (context) in twitter search systems. 5.3 Experiment on Content Sharability We evaluated the efficiency of our method to calculate content sharability. In this experiment, we selected tweets that manually scored greater than 3 (sharability) as relevant results for calculating precision, recall, and the F-measure. Based on preliminary experim ental results, we let  X  =50and  X  = 5. We used the results of morphological analysis by using MeCab to count the number of words in tweets and identify adjectives, adjective ver bs, adverbs, and nominal adjectives.
Figure 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c) are the precision-recall curves of S wp , S w ,and S p for sightseeing experiences E a , E b ,and E c , respectively.
Table 2 summarizes the experimental r esults. Compared to the baselines ( S p and S w ), in three sightseeing experiences, t he proposed method by considering both linguistic and media features improved the precision and F-measure by an average of about 1.5 times and 1.1 times, r espectively. These results indicated that the effective of considering both the feature of words in a tweet and the number of pictures to estimate sharability. 5.4 Efficiency of Organization by Combination of Relatedness and We compared the efficiency of our method of organizing sightseeing tweets by combining the context relatedness and sharability scores with that of a base-line. We used the results from the keyword-based OR search described in the experiment in Section 5.2 as the baseline.

In this experiment, we calculated an integrated score RS ( t i ) of relatedness and sharability as following.
 Based on the experimental results in Section 5.2, we let X =2and  X  t =10to compute the context relatedness, i.e., Rx ( t i | X =2 , X  t = 10).
 We selected two sets of relevant results, Set 4 X 3 and Set 3 X 3, as follows. Set 4 X 3 the manually assigned relatedness and sharability scores of relevant Set 3 X 3 the manually assigned relatedness and sharability scores of relevant
Table 3 and 4 summarize the results. Our method improved the F-measure by an average of four times and precision ratio by an average of nine times from those of the baseline.
Figure 3(a) and 3(b) are the precision-recall curves of Sets 4 X 3 and 3 X 3, re-spectively. Compared to the baseline, our method greatly improved the recall ratio while maintaining the precision ratio in both sets.

The precision of the baseline is better. One of the considerable reasons is that each tweet obtained by the baseline contains one or more spot (names) which user visited and then has high relatedness to the sightseeing experience. However, its recall is poor and may miss some valuable information. It is to say, our method can find more sightseeing tweets although they do not contain keyword directly related to the sightseeing experience.

Focusing on sightseeing experience E a , the precision ratio of Set 3 X 3 was higher than that of Set 4-3 when the recall ratio was lower than 0.7. This is because user U a posted many tweets about his sightseeing before and after the sightseeing day. This revealed that ou r method can discover tweets on a sight-seeing experience, even though they were posted before or after the sightseeing period. This is why we need collect candida te tweets before and after rather than during the sightseeing period. In this paper, we proposed a novel method of organizing and ranking fragmented tweets related to a certain sightseeing expe rience to search and share valuable user experiences posted on Twitter. The experim ental results revealed that the per-formance of the proposed method is bette r than that of keyword-based methods. Especially, taking into consideration th e effect of context tweets further improved performance. The experimental results also validate that content sharability is useful in discovering more informative tweets than just considering the related-ness of tweets and user experiences.

Future work includes further evaluation , general improvements in relatedness and content sharability computations, and an application system for organizing and sharing sightseeing experiences.
