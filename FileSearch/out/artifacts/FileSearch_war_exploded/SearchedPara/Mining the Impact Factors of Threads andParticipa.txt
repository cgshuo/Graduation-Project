 Usenet is world-wide discussion system on various topics. It provided a conve-nient way for the communication and organization of discussions. Comparing with web pages, the content of postings on Usenet is generally more informal, brief and personalized. It contains rich information and ideas contributed by all the postings in a group due to its huge size and loose organization. People can only subscribe a few groups and generally read a small fraction of the post-ings. It may take quite much time for a newbie to familiar with a group and its participators to use the group sensibly.

On WWW, because of the intrinsic hyperlink property of web pages, link analysis based on ideas of social networks has been used in the ranking system based ranking method have been witnessed with the success of Google, whose basis of ranking system is PageRank. Soc ial networks have been applied in other domains, such as marketing [3], email relationship [4] and so on.

As most postings on the Usenet do not contain hypertexts, they can not be benefited from these link-based algorithms of WWW directly. The briefness and casualty of newsgroup postings make it difficult for conventional text mining techniques. Some investigations based on social networks have also been done to extract useful information from the Usenet [5,6].

On the Usenet, person is judged only by his postings. Some people are in-fluential and popular in the newsgroup owing to their character and knowledge background. Some threads are more helpful and valuable than other threads due to their posting contents. The calculation of impact factors of participators (IFP) and impact factors of threads (IFT) can offer useful references for the newsgroup users and could be used in the ranking system of Usenet search in organizing the search results. Therefore, good IFP and IFT can provide intrinsic properties of a group and make the information on Usenet more accessible.
In this paper, according to the characteristics of Usenet, a link-based method to calculate the impact factors of parti cipators and threa ds on Usenet is pro-posed. Some mathematical analysis of this method is discussed and experimental results on real data sets are also given. 2.1 Usenet Group and Its Representation The postings on a newsgroup of Usenet were organized by threads. Each thread is invoked by one seed posting and followed by several response postings. The struc-ticipators and threads respectively. Considering a newsgroup containing n p par-p i posted some postings in thread t j , there is an edge node p i and t j in G , whose weight is the number of postings by participator p i in the thread t i .

The graph of a newsgroup can be rep resented with posting matrix M ,whose row and column represent the participator p i and thread t j respectively and the dimensional nonnegative matrix.

Let n a be the total number of post-ings in the newsgroup. A small news-group containing 4 participators, 3 threads and 12 postings was shown in Fig. 1. It can be represented as post-ing matrix 2.2 The Calculation of IFP and IFT One intuitive idea to calculate IFP is that if a participator posted more postings, he is more influential. Thus, the number of total postings of one participator can be a candidate of his IFP. Let n p dimensional row vector f p represent the IFP can be calculated with f p =( M e p ) T , where e p is a n p dimensional column IFT row vector f t can be calculated in similar way.

This method seems to be simple and feasible. However, this calculation works with the assumption that all postings have equal contribution to IFP and IFT, which is not reasonable enough. All postings are not created equal. A posting of more influential participator may have more impact than a posting by unknown one. This posting can improve the impact of the thread containing it. So it is bet-the opposite orientation may also work. A thread with high IFT makes the partici-pators more visible for others. Considering this, the IFP vector f p and IFT vector f t can be retrieved from the Usenet struc ture recursively, and we can find that the results have an interesting interpretation with later mathematical analysis.
In the following discussions, by M , V we denote matrix space and vector space respectively. Transformation N : M  X  M is defined as the normalization of the row vectors of matrix based on their l 1 norms. That is, for A  X  M , N
After transformed with N ,thepostingmatrix M was normalized to a stochas-tic matrix. The elements of normalized posting matrix N ij ( M )representthe proportion of postings posted by participator p i on thread t j and can be viewed and represents the votes of the reversed direction.

The IFP vector f p and IFT vector f t can be calculated as follow.
Since M is not a square matrix, the selection of the dimension of initial vector be merged together. Starting from initial vectors f p (0) = e p and f t (0) = e t , Eq. (1) and (2) can converge to their stable values f p1 , f t1 and f p2 , f t2 respectively. Then f p and f t can be obtained with The properties and convergence of our calculation will be discussed in section 2.3.
The implementation of the IFP and IFT calculation is matrix-free and only nnz ( M ) multiplications are needed for each iteration, where nnz ( M )isthe number of non-zeros in M .Since M is a sparse matrix, O ( nnz ( M ))  X  O ( n ). Only the storage of one vector f p ( k )or f t ( k )isrequiredateachiteration. Thus, this algorithm is suitable for the size and sparsity of posting matrix. We performed some experiments to evaluate the impact factors on realistic datasets. Some experimental results achieved will be discussed in section 3.2. 2.3 Analysis on the Calculation dimensional square matrix R (t) = N ( M T ) N ( M ). The following properties of R (p) and R (t) can be deduced.
 Property 1. R (p) and R (t) are stochastic.
 Proof. Omitted.
 Property 2. Let B : M  X  M represents the binary transformation, that is, for A  X  M , respectively.
 Proof. Let n p  X  n p dimensional square matrix S = MM T ,wehave Hence S is symmetric. Then we can get so B ( R (p) ) is symmetric.

According to definition in section 2.2, there is at least one link for the par-The property of B ( R (t) ) can be proved in the same way.
 When k  X  X  X  , f p ( k )  X  f p ,so f p can be calculated using power method and f t can also be obtained with f t = f p N ( M T ). Although R (p) is a stochastic matrix, it maybe not irreducible. Hence the convergence of power method can not be proved directly and this will be discussed next.

If R (p) is not irreducible, some nodes can not be accessible from other node in graph G . From the definition of graph G ,itmeans G is not connected and can be decomposed to serval connected components. Suppose G can be decomposed to s connected components, and each component contains n pccm participators and n tccm threads where m =1 , 2 ,...,s . There exists permutation matrix H with which R (p) can be permuted to a block diagonal matrix D (p) .Thus, H satisfies participators of connected components. From the definition and discussion above, radius equals to 1. Theref ore, according to Property 2, we can infer that the Markov chain with transition matrix D (pccm) is irreducible and ergodic. Suppose row vector v (pccm) satisfies From Eq. (6), v (pccm) is the left eigenvector of D (pccm) , and its normalization v (pccm) / v (pccm) 1 is a probability vector which is the stable solution of Markov chain with transition matrix D (pccm) . v (pccm) can be calculated using power method with any non-zero initial vector and the rate of convergence correspond-ing to the second largest eigenvalue of D (pccm) .

Since H is permutation matrix, H = H T = H  X  1 .AccordingtoEq.(5), where  X  f p (0) = f p (0) H .When k  X  X  X  , Eq. (7) yields
Since R (p) and R (t) are a stochastic square matrices, the l 1 norms of f p ( k ) and f t ( k ) keep unchanged after each iteration. Therefore, f p1 1 = f t1 1 = f p (0) 1 = n p ,and f p2 1 = f t2 1 = f t (0) 1 = n t . According to Eq. (3), the l 1 norm of v pccm in f p is
Therefore f p equals to the permute d eigenvectors of the D (p) and the IFP of each participator corresponds to the value of stable solution of Markov chain with transition matrix D (pccm) , which derives from the connected components in G . Similarly, IFT equals to the eigenvector value of block matrix in D (t) ,which is a block diagonal matrix transformed from R (t) . Therefore, IFP and IFT in our calculation are intrinsic properties of the posting matrix and could reflect the nature features of G , so they might be good measures of the participators and threads in a newsgroup. 3.1 Datasets Preparation We wrote a bot program in Perl to download the postings from the nntp server. The bot program communicates with nnt p server using socket connection following RFC 977 specification [7] and save the postings in text file with Mail-box format. Since only the headers are needed in our calculation, the headers were separated from the postings from the Mailbox file, and they are stored us-ing csv format after some text treatment. The contents in csv file were ordered and imported to database. SQL statements were performed on the database by a Java program through JDBC interface to construct and extract the structure of newsgroup based on the header information. The process of data sets collection and newsgroup structure extraction was shown in the diagram of Fig. 2.
Experiments were preformed on two dat a sets collected fr om comp.lang.perl. misc and comp.lang.python, which are two active newsgroups about computer languages on Usenet. The datasets are called DS1 and DS2 in the following.
DS1 contains 10532 postings including 1286 participators and 1774 threads of comp.lang.perl.misc from Mar 5, 2006 to Jun 27, 2006. DS2 contains 18821 postings including 2463 participators and 3408 threads of comp.lang.python from Mar 5, 2006 to Jun 27, 2006. 3.2 Experimental Results The convergence rates of in our experiments of DS1 and DS2 were plotted on semi-log graph shown in Fig. 3. Our method could converge rapidly, which fol-lows O (  X  k )where  X   X  (0 , 1).
 According to the analysis in section 2.3, we can get f p 1 = f t 1 =1 . Since the impact factors are small, the logarithms of IFT and IFP of DS1 and DS2 are shown in the histogram Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. In these histograms, most of the impact factors are quite small and a few impact factors are relatively high. Heavy tail features are exhibited in these distributions of IFP and IFT. In DS1, the participator with highest IFP is fredrik@pythonware.com whose IFP is 4 . 195  X  10  X  2 and the highest IFT thread is  X  X hat is Expressiveness in a Computer Language X  with IFT 4 . 297  X  10  X  2 . In DS2, tadmc@augustmail.com got the highest IFP of 2 . 911  X  10  X  2 and the highest IFT thread is also  X  X hat is Expressiveness in a Computer Language X  with IFT 2 . 481  X  10  X  2 .
IFP and IFT results can be used in some mining tasks on Usenet. For example, we can obtain the charac-teristics of each participator by con-sidering IFP and IFT simultaneously.
 Let T ( p i ) be the set of threads partic-ipated by p i . We can define f ave ,i t as the average IFT of T ( p i ), that is where m i t is size of T ( p i ). The rela-tionship of vector f ave t and f p in DS1 was shown in Fig. 6. In this figure, each symbol represents a participator.
 Only a few participators have both high f ave ,i t and high f p,i .TheIFPof p i is influenced by the f ave ,i t and the number of postings. A participator can improve his IFP by participating threads with high IFT or by posting a lot of postings. The average IFT of participator who owns very high IFP is generally not very high. In this paper, we proposed a method to mine the impact factors of the partici-pators and threads according to the characteristics of Usenet. From the analysis, we can see that our method can converge rapidly. Its results correspond to the eigenvectors of block matrices and the stationary vectors of Markov chains of connected components.

Our method is link-based and content independent, and it can be computed offline using only the posting headers. Th erefore, it can be implemented on the servers of newsgroup services or on the n ewsgroup client softwares. The results could provide useful intrinsic information of the newsgroup and can be used in many applications including helping organizing the search results, investigating hot topics and their evolutions for some period and so on.

Our method provides an essential way to determine the impact factors. Some improvements can be done based on it to adjust the results according to the requirements. For example, the seed post ing invokes the whole thread and plays special roles in the newsgroup, so it is better to give extra bonus to the seed postings other than the response postings in some situations.

On the WWW, it has been confirmed that link carries less noisy information than text, and the effectiveness of link a nalysis has been testified by some web search engines. Similar with web structure, the structure of newsgroup forms gradually along with the evolution of newsgroup. It represents the judgments and choices of participators. Therefore, it could provide rich information for the mining assignments on Usenet. Together with the IR methods based on text contents, link analysis can be used in the clustering, topic discovery, etc..
