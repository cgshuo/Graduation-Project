 Amit Saraswat, Ashish Saini n 1. Introduction
Many complex optimization problems related to power sys-tem planning and operations are required to be solved by the power system engineers and researchers. Optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) is one such optimization problem which is concerned with security and economy of power system operation. It is used to determine optimal settings of system control variables such as generators bus voltages, shunt capacitors/ inductors and transformers tap-settings, whereas the dependent variables are load bus voltages and generators reactive power outputs.

Although reactive power generation has no production cost, but it affects the overall generation cost by the way of real transmission losses. ORPD schedules all reactive power resources present in a power system to minimize the real transmission losses and consequently results in the lowest production cost for which the operation constraints are satisfied ( Zhao et al., 2005 ; Dai et al., 2009a ). The problem of voltage instability arises due to insufficient reactive support to maintain normal bus voltage profile at heavily loaded buses. Hence, extensive research efforts have been made to understand the phenomenon associated with the voltage instability ( Kessel and Glavitsch, 1986 ; Van Cutsem, 1991 ; Kamalasadan et al., 2009 ). Many ways to determine the static voltage stability of the system or to check the vulnerability of a bus towards instability by using real power-voltage (PV) curves, minimum singular value (MSV), L-index etc. are reported in literature ( Corsi, 2010 ). Therefore, in Refs. Vyjayanthi and
Thukaram (2011) and Bansilal et al. (1996 ), L-index is considered as objective function in ORPD formulation in order to incorporate the voltage stability improvement. Since, ORPD is a complex nonlinear optimization problem involving multiple local minima with mixture of discrete and continuous variables hence, it requires an efficient and robust solution technique.

In recent past, researchers paid more attention to multi-objective problem (MOP) formulation of ORPD to incorporate the issue of voltage stability. It requires multi-objective evolu-tionary algorithms (MOEAs) for their solution. Abido and
Bakhashwain (2005 ) considered total real transmission losses and voltage deviation as two objective functions in ORPD for-mulation and proposed a strength pareto evolutionary algorithm as solution technique. In Refs. Zhang and Liu (2008) and Dai et al. (2009b ), L-index is also included along with real transmission losses and voltage deviation to f ormulate multi-objective ORPD problem. Zhang and Liu (2008 ) presented a fuzzy adaptive particle swarm optimization approach, whereas Dai et al. (2009b ) adopted a weight sum approach using seeker optimization algorithm as a solution technique. In Ref. Montoya et al. (2010 ), the performance of
Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy is evaluated in order to minimize both voltage deviation and real transmission losses by operating under load tap-changers located at high voltage substations. Jeyadevi et al. (2011 ) proposed a modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (MNSGA-II) to solve multi-objective ORPD problem.
 stability called as ORPD-VS, is formulated as a nonlinear multi-objective optimization problem. It includes two objectives  X  total real transmission losses (TRTL) and voltage stability enhancement index (VSEI) also known as L-index. A new hybrid fuzzy multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (HFMOEA) is proposed to solve complex multi-objective problems like ORPD-VS. In HFMOEA, the two significant parameters such as crossover probability ( P mutation probability ( P M ) are varied dynamically during the execution of the optimization process to enhance overall stochas-tic search capability of algorithm. The variations in these para-meters take place according to the output of a fuzzy controller designed based on expert knowledge. Two detailed case studies are presented in this paper. In the first case study, the perfor-mance of HFMOEA is examined on five benchmark test problems such as ZDT1, ZDT2, ZDT3, ZDT4 and ZDT6 as suggested by Zitzler,
Deb and Thiele ( Zitzler et al., 2000 ). The second case study is focussed on the application of HFMOEA to multi-objective ORPD-VS problem and tested on standard IEEE 24 bus reliability test system.
In both the case studies, the perf ormance of HFMOEA is compared with two elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms such as a real-coded NSGA-II ( Deb et al., 2002 ) and its modified version called as MNSGA-II ( Jeyadevi et al., 2011 ). Moreover, the optimization results and pareto-optimal fronts obtained from all three MOEAs are analysed in terms of three multi-ob jective performance metrics such as spacing, generational distance and hypervolume.
 the mathematical formulation for multi-objective optimal reac-tive power dispatch problem. In Section 3 , the details of HFMOEA to solve multi-objective ORPD-VS problem are described. The numerical results of two case studies along with detailed discus-sions are presented in Section 4 . The conclusion is drawn in
Section 5 . The appendix includes the details of three performance metrics used in this paper. 2. Problem formulation for multi-objective ORPD-VS the bus voltage profile within permissible limits besides the mini-mization of total transmission loss. Therefore, an issue of voltage stability is also incorporated in multi-objective formulation called as multi-objective ORPD-VS problem. The detailed explanation of problem formulation is given in following subsections. 2.1. Objectives in multi-objective ORPD-VS to minimize the total real power loss in the transmission network i.e. TRTL, which may be defined as follows: F 1  X  TRTL  X  where P k , s is the real power loss in k th transmission lines, N total number of transmission lines; g k is the conductance of the k th transmission line; V i , V j are bus voltages in p.u. and d phase angles in radian at the end buses i.e. i th and j th of the k th transmission line, respectively.

The second objective is to minimize a voltage stability enhance-ment index (VSEI) also known as L-index ( Kessel and Glavitsch, 1986 ) in order to incorporate the voltage stability improvement in
ORPD-VS problem. It is a static voltage stability measure of power system which is computed based on normal load flow solution as presented in Vyjayanthi and Thukaram (2011) and Bansilal et al. (1996 ). Its value may be defined as follows:
F  X  VSEI  X  L -index  X  max L j  X  1 where all the terms within the sig ma of (2) are complex quantities. The values F ji are obtained from the Y-bus matrix as follows: I I "# bus voltages, respectively; whereas [ Y GG ], [ Y GL ], [ Y corresponding portions of network Y-bus matrix. Rearranging (3), we obtain V I "# where F The value of L-index lies between 0 and 1 ( Vyjayanthi and
Thukaram, 2011 ). L-index value less than 1 (voltage collapse point) and close to 0 (no load point) indicates a system state i.e. system voltage stability margin. For a given network, as the load/ generation increases, the voltage magnitude and angles change, and for near maximum power transfer condition, the voltage stability index L j values for load buses tends close to 1, indicating that the system is close to voltage collapse. 2.2. System constraints in multi-objective ORPD-VS
Both the above mentioned objective functions (1) and (2) are optimized while satisfying following system equality and inequal-ity constraints: 2.2.1. Equality constraints P Q where N B is the number of buses; P G and Q G are the generator real and reactive power, respectively; P D and Q D are the load real and reactive power, respectively; G ij and B ij are the transfer conduc-tance and susceptance between bus i and bus j , respectively; y the phase angle in radian associated with the reactance between bus i and bus j . 2.2.2. Inequality constraints (a) Reactive power provision limits (b) Bus voltage limits (c) Security constraints (d) Transformer tap-setting constraints 2.3. Generalized augmented objective function In this paper, a static penalty function approach ( Alsac and Stott, 1974 ; Lai et al., 1997 ) is used to handle the inequality constraint violations. The infeasible solutions are penalized, by applying a constant penalty to those solutions. Therefore, penalty functions corresponding to voltage violations at all load buses, reactive power violations at all generator buses, real power violations at slack bus and power flow violations at all transmission lines  X  l follows: F n  X  F n  X  where F n is n th objective function value and the limits of dependent variables are defined as V Q S
P  X  3. HFMOEA for solving multi-objective ORPD-VS problem
HFMOEA approach is developed for solving complex multi-objec-tive problems such as ORPD-VS problem. A flowchart of proposed algorithm for solving of multi-objective ORPD-VS problem is shown in Fig. 1 . The details of proposed HFMOEA are discussed as below. 3.1. Initialization
The first step is input power system data (i.e. bus data, generator data and line data in as specific format) and various parameters of HFMOEA such as population size ( popsize ), max-imum numbers of iterations ( max_iterations ), number of control variables, system constraints limits, initial crossover probability ( P ), initial mutation probability ( P M ) etc. 3.2. Generation of initial population
Initial population is generated randomly according to follow-ing procedural steps:
Step 1 : Generate a string of real valued random numbers within their given variable limits to form a single individual; 3.3. Non-domination sorting domination sorting algorithm as suggested in Refs. Deb (2001) and Deb et al. (2002 ). 3.4. Evolutionary operators ing evolutionary operators are applied to parent population:
K Selection : Tournament selection operator ( Deb, 2001 ; Deb
K Crossover : The BLX-a crossover ( Deb, 2001 ) is applied on
K Mutation: The PCA based Mutation ( Saraswat and Saini, 2011 ) 3.5. Criterion to prepare population for next iteration population is checked to prepare new population for next itera-tion by going through following procedural steps, till the termi-nation condition is not satisfied: 3.6. Normalized fitness function population is assigned based on their respective generalized augmented functions as determined in (15). Thus the fitness
H where N obj is the total number of objectives, F aug n , l function computed by (15) of n th objective for l th individual and K is the appropriate constant corresponding to n th objective which depends on the nature of problem. These constants are chosen in such a manner that normalized fitness values of any individual must remain within range [0 1.0] in order to fire correct fuzzy rule. 3.7. Best compromise solution
Upon having the Pareto-optimal set of non-dominated solution using proposed HFMOEA appro ach, an approach proposed in Dhillon et al. (1993 ) selects one solution to the decision maker as the best compromise solution as used in Abido and Bakhashwain (2005 ).
This approach suggests that due to imprecise nature of the decision maker X  X  judgment, the i th objective function F i is represented by a membership function m i defined as in Dhillon et al. (1993 ):  X  where F min i and F max i are the minimum and maximum values of the i th objective function among all non-dominated solutions, respec-tively. For each j th non-dominated solution, the normalized mem-bership function m j is calculated as m j  X  where N dom is the number of non-dominated solutions. The best compromise solution is that having the maximum value of m
Therefore, based on above criterion, the best compromised individual is selected from current population. Let H bc n normalized fitness value corresponding to n th objective as deter-mined by (20) for a best compromised individual. H bc n is required to evaluate one of the fuzzy variables used in fuzzy logic controller as explained in next subsection. 3.8. Fuzzy logic controller
In most of the MOEAs reported in literature, the various algorithm parameters such as crossover and mutation probabil-ities are initialized at the beginning of MOEA X  X  execution and kept constant throughout the optimization process. These MOEA parameters greatly influence the convergence of optimization process and often become very critical by limiting its performance to reach the global optimum. Moreover, it has been experienced that it may lead to slow convergence and seldom trapped into local pareto-optimal solutions. In this situation, a large change in the decision vector (i.e. control variables vector) is needed to get out of a local optimum. Unless mutation or crossover operators are capable of creating solutions in the basin of another better attractor, the improvement in the convergence toward the true pareto-optimal front is not possible ( Deb et al., 2002 ). Therefore, based on this knowledge, a fuzzy logic controller FLC_MOEA is designed for adjusting P C and P M dynamically during the optimi-zation process. The block diagram of FLC_MOEA is shown in Fig. 2 .
It incorporates three major blocks i.e. fuzzification , approximate reasoning and defuzzification as described below.
 3.8.1. Fuzzification
In proposed FLC_MOEA , there are three input fuzzy variables such as best compromised fitness ( BCF ), number of iterations for unchanged best compromised fitness value ( UN ) and variance of the fitness values of all individueals within offspring population ( VF ), which are defined as below: BCF  X  min f H bc n g ; 8 n  X  1 : N obj  X  23  X  UN  X  min f UN bc n g ; 8 n  X  1 : N obj  X  25  X  where UN n is the number of iterations for unchanged best compromised fitness value corresponding to n th objective.
Thus the ranges of three input fuzzy variables ( BCF , UN and VF ) and also two output fuzzy variables ( P C and P M ) are repersented by three lingustic terms as LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH. Among a set of membership functions, left-triangle, triangle and right-triangle membership functions are used for every input and output variables of FLC_MOEA as illustrated in Fig. 3 . 3.8.2. Approximate reasoning
In order to deal with uncertainty, an approximate reasoning is established for inference which includes a fuzzy rule base and fuzzy inference engine as described below. 3.8.2.1. Fuzzy rule base. The following important considerations are taken into account to form the fuzzy rule base:
BCF for each iteration is expected to change over a number of iterations, but if it does not change significantly over a number of iterations ( UN ) then this information is considered to cause changes in both P C and P M .

The diversity of a population is one of the factors, which influences the search for a true pareto-optimal solution. The variance of the fitness values of objective function ( VF )ofa population is a measure of its diversity. Hence, it is considered as another factor on which both P C and P M may be changed.
The Mamdani-type fuzzy rule is used to formulate the conditional statements that comprise fuzzy logic. Total 15 Mamdani-type rules are framed as conditional statements, which are listed as below: 1. If ( BCF is low) then ( P C is high) ( P M is low) (1) 2. If ( BCF is medium) and ( UN is low) then ( P C is high) ( P 3. If ( BCF is high) and ( UN is low) then ( P C is high) ( P 4. If ( BCF is medium) and ( UN is medium) then ( P C is 5. If ( BCF is high) and ( UN is medium) then ( P C is medium) 6. If ( UN is high) and ( VF is low) then ( P C is low) ( P 7. If ( UN is high) and ( VF is medium) then ( P C is low) (1) 8. If ( UN is high) and ( VF is high) then ( P C is medium) (1) 9. If ( BCF is high) and ( VF is medium) then ( P M is low) (1) 10. If ( BCF is high) and ( VF is high) then ( P M is low) (1) 11. If ( VF is high) then ( P C is high) ( P M is low) (1) 12. If ( VF is medium) then ( P C is high) ( P M is low) (1) 13. If ( BCF is high) and ( VF is low) then ( P C is high) ( P 14. If ( BCF is medium) and ( VF is medium) then ( P C is low) ( P 15. If ( BCF is low) and ( UN is low) and ( VF is low) then ( P 3.8.2.2. Fuzzy inference engine. The fuzzy implication is modelled by Mamdani X  X  minimum operator and the sentence connective also is interpreted as oring the propositions and defined by max operator. The AND operator is typically used to combine the membership values for each fired rule to generate the membership values for the fuzzy sets of output variables in the consequent part of the rule.

In order to interpret the entire fuzzy inference process at once, a fuzzy inference diagram for FLC_MOEA is presented in Fig. 4 .In this figure, the five small plots in each row represent the antecedent and consequent of the particular rule. Hence, each rule is a row of plots, and each column is a variable. The first three columns of plots show the membership functions referenced by the antecedent, or the if-part of each rule. The fourth and fifth columns of plots show the membership functions referenced by the consequent, or the then-part of each rule. The bottom most plots in fourth and fifth column represent the aggregate weighted decision values of P C and P M . This diagram may be used as a diagnostic for the performance of 15 fuzzy rules. For example, it shows that which rules are active, or how individual membership function shapes are influencing the results. Further, the three dimensional rule surfaces are plotted in Fig. 5 to display the dependency of any one of two outputs (i.e. P C and P M ) on any two of the three inputs (i.e. BCF , UN and VF )of FLC_MOEA . 3.8.3. Defuzzification is used for defuzzification. The defuzzified output values of
FLC_MOEA are directly acceptable values of HFMOEA parameters, for example: outputs Y 1  X  0.85 and Y 2  X  0.02 represent the cross-over and mutation probabilities, respectively in HFMOEA. Y  X  where the input for the defuzzification process is a fuzzy set m (the aggregate output fuzzy set) and the output is a single number Y . In brief, FLC_MOEA is used to provide a kind of adaptability to
HFMOEA by online tuning of its significant parameters in order to enhance the capability to reach near true pareto-optimal solution.
Therefore, the contribution of the proposed HFMOEA lies in the fact that the determination of the heuristic parameters is assigned to the fuzzy system, in contrast to the previously developed
MOEAs. 4. Numerical results and discussion
In this section, two case studies are conducted for evaluating the strength of the proposed HFMOEA approach. In first case study, the performance of HFMOEA is verified on five benchmark test pro-blems namely as ZDT1, ZDT2, ZDT3, ZDT4 and ZDT6. In second case study, HFMOEA is applied to multi-objective ORPD-VS problem as described in Section 2 . In both these case studies, the proposed
HFMOEA is tested and compared with two elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms such as a real-coded NSGA-II ( Deb et al., 2002 ) and its modified version called as MNSGA-II ( Jeyadevi et al., 2011 ). The difference between NSGA-II and MNSGA-II is that MNSGA-II incorporates the concep t of dynamic crowding distance along with controlled elitism as suggested in Ref. Jeyadevi et al. (2011 ). Both NSGA-II and MNSGA-II include a simulated binary crossover (SBX) ( Deb and Agarwal, 1995 ) and a polynomial muta-tion with distribution indexes ( Deb et al., 2002 )as Z c m  X  20 for crossover and mutation operators, respectively. These distribution indexes and their probabilities such as P C  X  0.95 and P  X  0.015 are fixed throughout the optimization process for NSGA-II and MNSGA-II. In HFMOEA, a BLX-a crossover and PCA-mutation operators are used as in Ref. Saraswat and Saini (2011 )with dynamically varying probabilities ( P C and P M ) after every ten itera-tions based on fuzzy logic controller ( FLC_MOEA ) as described in Section 3 . All the simulations are carried out in MATLAB 7.0 pro-gramming environment on Pentium IV 2.27GHz, 2.0GB RAM computer system. 4.1. Performance assessment
In multi-objective optimization processes (MOPs), there are two distinct and orthogonal goals ( Deb, 2001 ) as follows: (1) dis-cover solutions as close to the true pareto-optimal solutions as possible, and (2) find solutions as diverse as possible in the obtained non-dominated front. Therefore, in order to compare two or more MOEAs, at least two performance metrics (one evaluating the progress towards the true pareto-optimal front i.e. P n and the other evaluating the spread of obtained pareto-front i.e. Q ) need to be used. In both the case studies, three different performance metrics such as spacing ( S ), generational distance ( GD ) and hypervolume ( HV ) are used for numerical comparison of the pareto-optimal fronts produced by three MOEAs. The exact definitions of these three performance metrics are given in the Appendix. The metric GD is used to evaluate the progress towards the pareto-optimal front and the metrics S is used to evaluate the spread of the obtained non-dominated solutions. The metric HV provides the combined qualitative information about closeness and diversity in obtained pareto-optimal fronts. 4.2. Case study 1: benchmark test problems In order to examine the performance, all three MOEAs i.e. NSGA-II,
MNSGA-II and HFMOEA are tested and compared on five benchmark test problems such as ZDT1, ZDT2, ZDT3, ZDT4 and ZDT6 as suggested by Zitzler et al. (2000) . All five test problems have two objective functionsasdescribedin Table 1 . None of these problems have any constraint. Table 1 also shows the number of variables, their bounds, the pareto-optimal solutions, and the nature of the pareto-optimal front for each test problem i.e. whether it is convex or non-convex, continuous or discontinuous.
 Three test cases are considered, in which the performance of
MOEAs are evaluated for maximum number of iterations such as 300, 500 and 1000 for case 1.1, case 1.2 and case 1.3, respectively.
For all five test problems, 20 independent simulation runs are performed with same constant population size of 100 in all the three cases. For all these ZDT problems, the values of constants K for HFMOEA are taken as K 1  X  1 and K 2  X  1 based on explanation given in Section 3.6 .

The results in terms of best compromised solutions obtained after optimization are given in Table 2 . Further, the statistical results in terms of mean and variance of three performance metrics (i.e. S , GD and HV ) in 20 simulation runs are also listed in Tables 3 and 4 . The best pareto-optimal fronts obtained from all three MOEAs are depicted in Figs. 6 and 7 . On the basis of this case study, some of the major observations are made as follows: In both aspects of convergence and distribution of solutions, HFMOEA performed better than both MNSGA-II and NSGA-II. Hence, proposed HFMOEA provides the better pareto-optimal fronts and performance metrics as compared to NSGA-II and MNSGA-II for all five ZDT test problems in all the three cases. true pareto-optimal fronts except for ZDT4. In contrast, MNSGA-II has improved convergence compared to NSGA-II, but not better than HFMOEA. In fact, NSGA-II could not be satisfactorily con-verged particularly in case 1.1 and case 1.2 in 300 and 500 iterations, respectively.

The problem ZDT4 has 21 different local Pareto-optimal fronts in the search space, of which only one corresponds to the global Pareto-optimal front ( Deb and Agarwal, 1995 ). Therefore, Fig. 7 a X  X  show that both NSGA-II and MNSGA-II get stuck at different local Pareto-optimal sets, but HFMOEA managed to reach near global pareto-optimal solution in 500 iterations whereas MNSGA-II in 1000 iterations.
 Hence based on above analysis, it may be concluded that
HFMOEA has higher convergence rate as well as ability to produce more diversified population during the optimization process in comparison to MNSGA-II and NSGA-II for obtaining better pareto-optimal fronts. This is because of the variations occurred in
HFMOEA parameters such as P C and P M according to output of fuzzy logic controller ( FLC_MOEA ) based on the state of optimiza-tion process and nature of problem. The variations in P C P
M for all five test problems in case 1.2 are shown in Fig. 8 .It has been observed that these variations are depending upon the type of objective functions in such a manner that if P is going to reduce, P M will increase (see Fig. 8 ) and vice-versa.
These variations in P C and P M would improve the stochastic search to arrive at near true pare to-optimal front as clear from
Figs. 6 and 7 . 4.3. Case study 2: ORPD-VS problem In this case study, HFMOEA is applied to multi-objective
ORPD-VS problem on IEEE 24 bus Reliability Test System (IEEE 24 bus RTS) data ( Reliability Test System Task Force, 1999 ). The single line diagram of IEEE 24 bus RTS is shown in Fig. 9 . This power system consists of 32 synchronous generators, 1 synchro-nous condenser (located at bus 14), and 17 constant-power type loads. The system total active and reactive loads are 2850MW and 580MVAr, respectively. In IEEE 24 bus RTS, system control variables for ORPD-VS are such as 11 generator bus voltage magnitudes, five transformer tap-settings, and one bus shunt admittances. Therefore in this case study, the search space has 17 dimensions. The lower and upper limits of all bus voltages are
Objective 2 : F2
Objective 2 : F2
Objective 2 : F2 0.95p.u. and 1.05p.u., respectively. The lower and upper limits are 0.9p.u. and 1.1p.u, respectively.

In order to maintain the consistency for comparison, the ORPD-VS simulations are divided into five different test cases such as case 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5. In first two test cases, the ORPD-VS problem is treated as single objective optimization problem i.e. only TRTL in case 2.1 and only VSEI in case 2.2 are considered as single objectives for ORPD-VS optimization. In singl e objective framework, the real coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) ( Saraswat and Saini, 2011 )isusedto optimize an appropriate objective function while satisfying all equal-ity and inequality constraints (6) X (14). The last three test cases are considered as pure multi-objective ORPD-VS frameworks as described in Section 2 . Both the objective functi ons i.e. TRTL and VSEI are optimizedsimultaneouslyusingNAGA-II,MNSGA-IIandHFMOEAin cases 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5, respectively. For all the five test cases, 20 independent simulation runs are carried out with similar parameters for all optimization algorithms taken as: the number of maximum iterations ( max_iterations  X  500), population size ( popsize  X  200) and this case study, the values of constants K n are selected after conducting several initial indepe ndent runs of HFMOEA with various settings of K 1 and K 2 and their appropriate values are
K  X  38 and K 2  X  0 : 15 based on explanation given in Section 3.6 .
The detailed specifications of all optimization algorithms are sum-marized in Table 5 .

The best optimization results obtained from 20 simulation runs for all 5 test cases are summarized in Table 6 . The bold values in
Table 6 , represents the optimized objective function values obtained in ORPD-VS. In single objective ORPD-VS framework, the optimized solutions are (38.51MW, 0.1832) when only TRTL is minimized in case 2.1 and (41.29MW and 0.1601) when only VSEI is minimized in case 2.2. The best obtained pareto-optimal fronts in multi-objective ORPD-VS using NSGA-II, MNSGA-II and HFMOEA are shown in
Fig. 10 . The best compromised solutions are selected as (38.98MW and 0.1675), (39.12MW and 0.1656) and (38.99MW and 0.1663) for the pareto-optimal front and best compromised solution obtained using HFMOEA are superior as compared to the same obtained using
NSGA-II and MNSGA-II. Further, the statistical results in terms of mean and variance of three performance metrics (i.e. S , GD and HV )in 20 simulation runs for multi-objective ORPD-VS problem using all threeMOEAsarealsosummarizedin Table 7 . In order to generate the reference pareto-front for multi-objective ORPD-VS problem, the similar procedure involving multiple runs of single objective RCGA with weighted sum of objectives is adopted as suggested in Jeyadevi shown in Fig. 11 .

The system output control variables such as generator bus voltages, transformer tap-settings and shunt inductor obtained after optimization for ORPD-VS problem in all five test cases are given in Table 8 . The generators reactive power output schedules obtained after optimization in ORPD-VS in all five test cases are listed in Table 9 . It is clear that the total reactive power genera-tion is achieved as extreme values i.e. minimum in case 2.1 and maximum in case 2.2, which are the cases of single objective optimization framework (see Table 9 ). The total reactive power generation is of moderate values obtained in multi-objective optimization frameworks as in cases 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5. 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 Mutation Probability (Pm)
The reactive power generation output schedule obtained after optimization using HFMOEA (best compromised solution) is graphically shown as in Fig. 12 . There is no violation in generators reactive power outputs, in other words all the generators reactive power output values are within their corresponding ranges of minimum and maximum permissible limits in case 2.5. Further, the bus voltage profiles obtained after optimization for ORPD-VS in all five test cases are compared as shown in Fig. 13 . It is noticed that the bus voltage profiles obtained in multi-objective ORPD-VS problem are more flat as compared to the same obtained in single-objective ORPD-VS problem. Hence, on the basis of this analysis, it is clear that multi-objective optimization framework may provide superior optimal solutions as compared to single objective optimization ORPD-VS approach for taking better dis-patch decisions by system operator. 5. Conclusion
In this work, ORPD-VS has been formulated as a multi-objective problem, in which two competing objective functions such as total real transmission loss and voltage stability enhance-ment index are optimized simultaneously in a single run. A new
HFMOEA is proposed for solving complex nonlinear multi-objec-tive optimization problems such as ORPD-VS. The main contribu-tion of the proposed HFMOEA algorithm lies in the design of fuzzy logic controller to adjust two significant parameters (i.e. P P ) during the optimization process which improves its overall performance. Three different MOEAs such as NSGA-II, MNSGA-II and HFMOEA are tested and compared for five benchmark test problems (i.e. ZDT1, ZDT2, ZDT3, ZDT4 and ZDT6) and also for multi-objective ORPD-VS problem on standard IEEE 24 RTS. Three multi-objective performance metrics such as spacing, genera-tional distance and hypervolume are used for evaluating the overall performance and quality of pareto-optimal fronts obtained from all three MOEAs. Some of the major findings of present work may be concluded in two perspectives. Firstly, in context to optimization framework for ORPD-VS, it is observed that the bus voltage profiles obtained in multi-objective formulations are more flat as compared to the same obtained in single-objective formulation. Therefore, a multi-objective optimization frame-work provides a set of superior optimal solutions as compared to single objective optimization framework for ORPD-VS. Sec-ondly, as far as algorithmic performance is concerned, it is found that HFMOEA provides superior results in terms of performance metrics as compared to NSGA-II and MNSGA-II, hence able to generate better pareto-optimal fronts in both the case studies.
Therefore, the proposed HFMOEA based multi-objective ORPD-VS problem helps a power system operator to take better dispatch decisions on the basis of pareto-optimal solutions as compared to other MOEAs.

 Appendix. Performance metrics
In this paper, following three performance metrics are used to evaluate and compare the optimiz ation performance of different MOEAs.
 A.1. Spacing (S)
The spacing metric ( S ) suggested by Schott (1995) is calculated with a relative distance measure between consecutive solutions in the obtained non-dominated set, as follows: S  X  the standard deviations of different d i values. When the solutions are nearly spaced, the corresponding distance measure will be small. Thus, an algorithm finding a set of non-dominated solutions having smaller spacing ( S ) is better.
 A.2. Generational distance (GD)
The generational distance ( GD ) as recommended by Veldhuizen (1999) evaluates an average distance of the solutions of Q from P n ,as follows: GD  X   X  for p  X  2, the parameter d i is the Euclidean distance (in the objective space) between the solution i A Q and the nearest member of P n : d  X  min Intuitively, an algorithm having a small value of GD is better. A.3. Hypervolume (HV)
The hypervolume metric ( HV ) provides a measure of conver-gence as well as diversity in a combined sense. It calculates the volume (in the objective space) covered by members of Q for problems where all objectives are to be minimized ( Veldhuizen, 1999 ; Zitzler and Thiele, 1998 ). Mathematically, for each solution i A
Q , a hypercube v i is constructed with reference point W and the solution i as the diagonal corners of the hypercube. The reference point can simply be the found by constructing a vector of worst objective function values. Thereafter, a union of all hypervolume ( HV ) is calculated as follows: HV  X  volume Obviously, an algorithm with large value of HV is desirable. This metric is free from arbitrary scaling of objectives. For example, if the first objective function takes values an order of magnitude more than of the second objective, a unit improve-ment in f 1 would reduce HV much more than that a unit improvement in f 2 . Thus, this metric will favour a set Q which has better converged solution set for the least-scaled objective function. To eliminate this difficulty, the above metric can be evaluated by using normalized objective function values. References
