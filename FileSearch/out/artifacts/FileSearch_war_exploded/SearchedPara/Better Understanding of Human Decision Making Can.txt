 Behavior modification is the pr ocess of identifying and changing an undesirable behavior to a more desirable one. As computational devices and the data they produce become more ubiquitous, sociotechnical systems utilizing these devices become more viable as tools to support be havior modification endeavors. These systems can be accessed at the moments people need them, supplying the right support and guidance on a personalized basis. As behaviors are based on deci sions, sociotechnical systems supporting behavior modification that incorporate our understanding of human decision making are likely to be more efficacious than those that do not. These systems can also utilize our knowledge of motivation to further improve their users X  likelihood of success. My dissertation research examines how our understanding of human decision making and motivation can be used to better determine how sociotechnical systems can be built that encourage and support people in their behavior modification efforts.

Judgment and Decision Making, Sociotechnical Systems, Behavior Modification, Motivation If we always did what was best for us and never exhibited undesirable behaviors, there w ould be no need for behavior modification. Sometimes we do not know what is best for us and it isn X  X  until we learn otherwise that our undesirable habits are long-established and difficult to break. Other times we know what choices are best for us in the long-term but choose those that satisfy proximal hedonistic desires instead, despite the problems these decisions will cause us in the future. Unfortunately, changing our behavior is difficult, and thus people fail in their endeavors to break bad habits and instead fall back into old ways of doing things, despite the knowledge of their deleterious behavior. Fortunately, we have learned much and continue to learn more about how and wh y people make decisions. Concurrently, sociotechnical system s have continued to grow in both utility and accessibility. Utilized together, sociotechnical systems that leverage our understanding of human decision making can be effective tools th at foster and support behavior modification. Sociotechnical systems are well-su ited to support individuals in their behavior modification endea vors. They are persistent (Fogg 2002) and do not forget, they provide anonymity and can be ubiquitous, and they leverage the fact that humans are innately social and obtain considerable value from social interaction (Porter 2008). Usually for behavior modificati on to occur, a person must say yes: first to the decision to change their behavior and subsequently to the behavior change until the new behavior becomes practice. With this in mind, systems designed for behavior change should help i ndividuals make the decision to change their behavior and then provide continual motivation to perform the activities that the new behavior is comprised of. There are a number of methods that can be used to get a person to say yes to doing an activity. Nudges guide people X  X  decisions towards predictable outcomes wit hout restricting or appreciably modifying the economic incentives of choices (Thaler 2008). Nudges have been shown to have short-term efficacy, but their long-term effects are unclear. Because we currently cannot speak to the long-term efficacy of nudges, it is important that we develop and run experiments that validate or invalidate their ability to modify behavior on large time scales. As part of my dissertation research, I intend to pursue this area of inquiry; if nudges are only effective epheme rally and show no long-term behavior modification results, thei r usefulness is rather limited. Social proof, social norms, public commitment, peer pressure, and competition are methods that utilize a person X  X  social environment in order to increase the likelihood th at they will decide to change their behavior. We have begun to explore how these methods can be utilized to influence a person X  X  environmental decisions. For example, it is now technologically feasible for consumers to access their real-time electricity usage via smart grid technologies. We are designing a sociotechnical system that provides an individual with their personal energy consumption and allows them to compare it to the average consumption of their neighbors (social norm) as well as the neighbor with the lowest consumption (social proof). Once an individual has decided to change their behavior, their levels of intrinsic and extrinsi c motivations dictate how likely they are to continue exhibiting the new behavior. We believe that an individual is most likely to be successful in changing their behavior over extended time frames when they are intrinsically motivated rather than extrinsically motivated. For example, individuals who are trying to redu ce their electricity consumption will be more likely to be successful when they are motivated by desires to help fight pollution and reduce their carbon footprint as opposed to being motivated by prizes. In a recent  X  X nergy competition X  that awarded a large prize to the household that reduced their electricity usage th e most, competitors reduced their usage (sometimes substantia lly) during the competition but reverted to original levels (or higher) when the competition http://www.fastcoexist.com/1679632/energy-battle-students-show-how-games-can-cut-electri c-bills.) As part of my dissertation research, I am expl oring how we can better help individuals find personal reasons to want to change their behavior, and then utilize those reasons in order to be successful in these endeavors. I am currently running an experime nt that examines methods that can be used to foster and support pro-environmental behavior change. In this study, I am exploring how environmental awareness coupled with emotional reactions affect an individual X  X  likelihood to take a pro-environmental action. Our energy usage behaviors are likely long established due to the existing energy infrastructure that we have interacted with for decades which have only reported our electricity usage in monthly increments via the nebulous unit kilowatt-hour (kWh). We do not believe that continuing to report electricity usage in kWh and dollars alone will help consumers understand how their usage actually impacts the environment. Alternative representations of electricity usage such as pounds of coal or CO 2 , however, can help achieve this. We believe that these alternative representations can serve two purposes. First, they help better establish meaning to electricity usage: people cannot visualize what a kWh looks like, but they can imagine what 100 pounds of coal looks like. Second, emotions have been shown to play a role in environmental decision making (Vining 1987), and we hypothesize that the alternative representations ha ve the potential to elicit an emotional reaction in consumers due to their availability and vividness. For instance, recalling a lump of coal likely conjures a negative reaction  X  coal looks sooty and dirty, and people can likely remember hearing about a coal mining accident. Supplementing the alternative repr esentations with information about how the tangible objects relate to electricity (e.g., only 30% of the energy yielded from burning coal is available for electricity production (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal)), can further strengthen these emotions. In the study, subjects in the control group are provided with a description of what a kWh is and then asked to rate their emotional response to this desc ription on a scale of 0-5 for happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, surprise, and anger. Subjects in the experimental groups are shown a picture of one of three alternative representations of energy use: coal, carbon dioxide, or US dollars and asked to rate th eir emotional response as in the control group. Next the subject s are supplied with information about the average US household X  X  monthly electricity usage using the representation utilized in th e previous step, kWh for the control group and coal, carbon dioxide, or dollars in the experimental groups. As in the previous step, the subjects are then asked to describe thei r emotional response to this information. In a subsequent study, subjects w ill be supplied with information about the average US household X  X  monthly electricity usage as above, but rather than asking them to describe their emotional response, respondents will instead be asked if they would be willing to commit to reducing their electricity bill by 5% in the coming month. I believe that th e representations of energy use that elicit the strongest emotional reactions as found in the first study will be most likely to cause shifts toward more pro-environmental behaviors in consumers such as agreeing to try and reduce one X  X  electric bill. The insights yielded from these experiments will be used in the design of the sociotechnical system designed to assist cons umers in their energy saving endeavors described above. Subsequent research to the work described above could explore how reported emotions change wh en respondents are aware of the responses of others like them. For example, will a person say they are more disgusted by a picture of coal if they know that someone like them was disgusted by the picture than if they weren X  X  supplied with this information? In other words, can social influencers like social norms and social proof  X  X verride X  a person X  X  emotional response? A nd if so, are these effects long-lasting or only present when the influencers are present? Answering questions such as th ese can help us better understand how people make decisions, and th is understanding can assist us in constructing effective soci otechnical systems designed to support behavior change.
