 1. INTRODUCTION The ACM TALIP Special Issue on NTCIR-6 contains three articl es selected from the submissions by researchers involved in the Sixth NT CIR Workshop (hereafter NTCIR-6) [Kando and Evans 2007].
 hance research in information access technologies, such as information re-trieval, question answering, summarization, and text mini ng. The main goal of the NTCIR project is to provide infrastructure for large-scale evaluations of information access technologies, and then to speed up the research and the technology transfer. The major components of the infrastru cture are reusable test collections, evaluation metrics, and a forum for resea rchers. As the fun-damental text processing in information access technologi es, such as index-ing, which includes language-dependent procedures, the NT CIR workshop has placed emphasis on but has not limited it to, East Asian langu ages such as Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, (and English documents publ ished in Asia), and its series of workshops has attracted international par ticipation. different from ordinary scientific conferences, the organi zers and participating research groups work together in the process before the final meeting. The task organizers propose the tasks, the data sets used for exp eriments, and the evaluation metrics and methods. Each of the participating r esearch groups can participate for their own purposes and targets, and cond uct research and experiments using the same data set provided by NTCIR. The ex perimental results are collected, and analyses and cross-system compa risons are reported at the final meeting. After the meeting, most of the test colle ctions constructed through the NTCIR workshop are made available to nonpartici pating research groups for research purposes.
 April 2006 and the meeting was held May 15-18, 2007, at the Nat ional In-stitute of Informatics in Tokyo, Japan. The NTCIR-6 selecte d six research areas as tasks: Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR ); Cross-Lingual Question Answering (CLQA) for factoid questions in Chinese , English, and Japanese; Multimodal Summarization of Trends (MuST); Opin ion Analysis Pilot (OPINION); Patent Retrieval (PATENT); and Question A nswering Chal-lenge (QAC), for any types of questions. One hundred and four groups from 15 different countries and areas registered to one of the tasks set for NTCIR-6, and 85 groups completed the experiments in time, submitted t heir results, and presented papers at the final meeting. licited them to be enhanced and submitted to the special issu e on NTCIR-6. Of these 15 articles, eight were submitted. Each submitted art icle was reviewed by three or more referees, each of which followed the standar d review proce-dures of ACM-TALIP. Three of these articles were selected fo r publication. We could select only three articles in the given timeframe, but they well represent a variety of the tasks in NTCIR-6. 2. ARTICLES IN THE SPECIAL ISSUE Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) between langu ages with completely different origins and structures has been one of the charact eristic tasks in the NTCIR since NTCIR-1. In the CLIR between languages with d ifferent character sets and alphabets, named entities and proper nou ns that can play major roles in the queries are often lost due to the out-of-vo cabulary (OOV) problem, and various approaches to overcome these OOV issue s have been investigated and tested in the series of NTCIRs. The first art icle, A Hybrid Technique for English-Chinese Cross Language Information Retrieval by Dong Zhou, Mark Truran, Tim Brailsford and Helen Ashman, represe nts work from the NTCIR-6 CLIR task. The authors propose a combination of t wo techniques for English-Chinese CLIR: a pattern-matching approach for handling out-of-vocabulary query terms, and a graph-based approach for hand ling translation disambiguation, which are applied one after the other.The a uthors found that the NTCIR and TREC test collections may have quite different properties. from Relation-annotated Corpora to Improve Question Answe ring for why-Questions by Ryuichiro Higashinaka and Hideki Isozaki, reported on a s olid application of statistical machine learning methods for mo dels that rank candidate answers to why questions using a combination of di fferent types of features. For answering why-questions, it is critical to extract the right passages that include the answers. One of the typical approa ches to this is using hand-crafted Rules to identify the cause-bearing pas sages using typical clues such as  X  X ecause, X  etc. Most of the participating grou ps for NTCIR-6 QAC used these types of hand-crafted Rules. This article uni quely investi-gated a method of automatically extracting causal patterns from a corpus and it performed well. This indicates there is a possibility tha t this approach could be widely applied to other languages at a reasonable cost wit hout the costly process of handcrafting answer extracting rules.
 sification of Patents by Yaoyong Li and Kalina Bontcheva, reports on interest-ing work in which a Support Vector Machine was successfully a dapted to the task of classifying Japanese patents, which is a rather new d ocument genre in text categorization research, with long and multitopic, semi-structured documents containing highly technical terminologies into multifaceted hier-archical structured categories of patent F-terms. It also i ncludes a thorough analysis to depict how the proposed system worked. Patent re trieval and classification is one of the characteristic tasks in the NTCI R. The problem of multifaceted hierarchical classification that the article tackled is theoretically interesting and new, and it also has practical value for futu re application. that the special issue will contribute to research and devel opment in the area of information access technologies on Asian languages.
