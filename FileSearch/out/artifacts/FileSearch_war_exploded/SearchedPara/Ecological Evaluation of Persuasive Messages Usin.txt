 In recent years there has been a growing interest in finding new cheap and fast methodologies to be used in experimental research, for, but not limited to, NLP tasks. In particular, approaches to NLP that rely on the use of web tools -for crowdsourcing long and tedious tasks -have emerged. Amazon Mechani-cal Turk, for example, has been used for collecting annotated data (Snow et al., 2008). However ap-proaches a la Mechanical Turk might not be suitable for all tasks.

In this paper we focus on evaluating systems and theories about persuasion, see for example (Fogg, 2009) or the survey on persuasive NL generation studies in (Guerini et al., 2011a). Measuring the impact of a message is of paramount importance in this context, for example how affective text varia-tions can alter the persuasive impact of a message.
The problem is that evaluation experiments repre-sent a bottleneck: they are expensive and time con-suming, and recruiting a high number of human par-ticipants is usually very difficult.

To overcome this bottleneck, we present a specific cheap and fast methodology to automatize large-scale evaluation campaigns. This methodology al-lows us to crowdsource experiments with thousands of subjects for a few euros in a few hours, by tweak-ing and using existing commercial tools for adver-tising on the web. In particular we make reference to the AdWords Campaign Experiment (ACE) tool provided within the Google AdWords suite. One important aspect of this tool is that it allows for real-time fully-automated data analysis to discover sta-tistically significant phenomena. It is worth noting that this work originated in the need to evaluate the impact of short persuasive messages, so as to assess the effectiveness of different linguistic choices. Still, we believe that there is further potential for opening an interesting avenue for experimentally exploring other aspects of the wide field of pragmatics.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 dis-cusses the main advantages of ecological approaches using Google ACE over traditional lab settings and state-of-the-art crowdsourcing methodologies. Sec-tion 3 presents the main AdWords features. Section 4 describes how AdWords features can be used for defining message persuasiveness metrics and what kind of stimulus characteristics can be evaluated. Fi-nally Sections 5 and 6 describe how to build up an experimental scenario and some pilot studies to test the feasibility of our approach. Evaluation of the effectiveness of persuasive sys-tems is very expensive and time consuming, as the STOP experience showed (Reiter et al., 2003): de-signing the experiment, recruiting subjects, making them take part in the experiment, dispensing ques-tionnaires, gathering and analyzing data.

Existing methodologies for evaluating persuasion are usually split in two main sets, depending on the setup and domain: (i) long-term, in the field eval-uation of behavioral change (as the STOP example mentioned before), and (ii) lab settings for evaluat-ing short-term effects, as in (Andrews et al., 2008). While in the first approach it is difficult to take into account the role of external events that can occur over long time spans, in the second there are still problems of recruiting subjects and of time consum-ing activities such as questionnaire gathering and processing.

In addition, sometimes carefully designed exper-iments can fail because: (i) effects are too subtle to be measured with a limited number of subjects or (ii) participants are not engaged enough by the task to provoke usable reactions, see for example what reported in (Van Der Sluis and Mellish, 2010). Es-pecially the second point is awkward: in fact, sub-jects can actually be convinced by the message to which they are exposed, but if they feel they do not care, they may not  X  X eact X  at all, which is the case in many artificial settings. To sum up, the main prob-lems are: 1. Time consuming activities 2. Subject recruitment 3. Subject motivation 4. Subtle effects measurements 2.1 Partial Solution -Mechanical Turk A recent trend for behavioral studies that is emerg-ing is the use of Mechanical Turk (Mason and Suri, 2010) or similar tools to overcome part of these limi-tations -such as subject recruitment. Still we believe that this poses other problems in assessing behav-ioral changes, and, more generally, persuasion ef-fects. In fact: 1. Studies must be as ecological as possible, i.e. 2. Subjects should be neither aware of being ob-
In the case of Mechanical Turk for example, sub-jects are willingly undergoing a process of being tested on their skills (e.g. by performing annota-tion tasks). Cover stories can be used to soften this awareness effect, nonetheless the fact that subjects are being paid for performing the task renders the approach unfeasible for behavioral change studies. It is necessary that the only reason for behavior in-duction taking place during the experiment (filling a form, responding to a questionnaire, clicking on an item, etc.) is the exposition to the experimental stimuli, not the external reward. Moreover, Mechan-ical Turk is based on the notion of a  X  X old standard X  to assess contributors reliability, but for studies con-cerned with persuasion it is almost impossible to de-fine such a reference: there is no  X  X ight X  action the contributor can perform, so there is no way to assess whether the subject is performing the action because induced to do so by the persuasive strategy, or just in order to receive money. On the aspect of how to handle subject reliability in coding tasks, see for ex-ample the method proposed in (Negri et al., 2010). 2.2 Proposed Solution -Targeted Ads on the Ecological studies (e.g. using Google AdWords) of-fer a possible solution to the following problems: 1. Time consuming activities: apart from experi-2. Subject recruitment: the potential pool of sub-3. Subject motivation: ads can be targeted exactly 4. Subject unaware, unbiased: subjects are totally 5. Subtle effects measurements: if the are not
Note that similar ecological approaches are begin-ning to be investigated: for example in (Aral and Walker, 2010) an approach to assessing the social ef-fects of content features on an on-line community is presented. A previous approach that uses AdWords was presented in (Guerini et al., 2010), but it crowd-sourced only the running of the experiment, not data manipulation and analysis, and was not totally con-trolled for subject randomness. Google AdWords is Google X  X  advertising program. The central idea is to let advertisers display their messages only to relevant audiences. This is done by means of keyword-based contextualization on the Google network, divided into:  X  Search network: includes Google search pages,  X  Display network: includes news pages, topic-When a user enters a query like  X  X ruise X  in the Google search network, Google displays a variety of relevant pages, along with ads that link to cruise trip businesses. To be displayed, these ads must be asso-ciated with relevant keywords selected by the adver-tiser.

Every advertiser has an AdWords account that is structured like a pyramid: (i) account, (ii) campaign and (iii) ad group. In this paper we focus on ad groups. Each grouping gathers similar keywords to-gether -for instance by a common theme -around an ad group. For each ad group, the advertiser sets a cost-per-click (CPC) bid. The CPC bid refers to the amount the advertiser is willing to pay for a click on his ad; the cost of the actual click instead is based on its quality score (a complex measure out of the scope of the present paper).

For every ad group there could be multiple ads to be served, and there are many AdWords measure-ments for identifying the performance of each single ad (its persuasiveness, from our point of view):  X  CTR, Click Through Rate: measures the num- X  Conversion Rate: if someone clicks on an ad,  X  ROI: Other conversions can be page views or  X  Google Analytics Tool: Google Analytics is a So far, we have been talking about text ads, -Google X  X  most traditional and popular ad format -because they are the most useful for NLP analysis. In addition there is also the possibility of creating the following types of ads:  X  Image (and animated) ads  X  Video ads  X  Local business ads  X  Mobile ads
The above formats allow for a greater potential to investigate persuasive impact of messages (other than text-based) but their use is beyond the scope of the present paper 1 . AdWords can be used to design and develop vari-ous metrics for fast and fully-automated evaluation experiments, in particular using the ACE tool.
This tool -released in late 2010 -allows testing, from a marketing perspective, if any change made to a promotion campaign (e.g. a keyword bid) had a statistically measurable impact on the campaign it-self. Our primary aim is slightly different: we are interested in testing how different messages impact (possibly different) audiences. Still the ACE tool goes exactly in the direction we aim at, since it in-corporates statistically significant testing and allows avoiding many of the tweaking and tuning actions which were necessary before its release.

The ACE tool also introduces an option that was not possible before, that of real-time testing of sta-tistical significance. This means that it is no longer necessary to define a-priori the sample size for the experiment: as soon as a meaningful statistically significant difference emerges, the experiment can be stopped.

Another advantage is that the statistical knowl-edge to evaluate the experiment is no longer nec-essary: the researcher can focus only on setting up proper experimental designs 2 .
 The limit of the ACE tool is that it only allows A/B testing (single split with one control and one ex-perimental condition) so for experiments with more than two conditions or for particular experimental settings that do not fit with ACE testing bound-aries (e.g. cross campaign comparisons) we suggest taking (Guerini et al., 2010) as a reference model, even if the experimental setting is less controlled (e.g. subject randomness is not equally guaranteed as with ACE).

Finally it should be noted that even if ACE allows only A/B testing, it permits the decomposition of al-most any variable affecting a campaign experiment in its basic dimensions, and then to segment such dimensions according to control and experimental conditions. As an example of this powerful option, consider Tables 3 and 6 where control and experi-mental conditions are compared against every single keyword and every search network/ad position used for the experiments. Let us consider the design of an experiment with 2 conditions. First we create an ad Group with 2 com-peting messages (one message for each condition). Then we choose the serving method (in our opin-ion the rotate option is better than optimize , since it guarantees subject randomness and is more transpar-ent) and the context (language, network, etc.). Then we activate the ads and wait. As soon as data begins to be collected we can monitor the two conditions according to:  X  Basic Metrics: the highest CTR measure in- X  Google Analytics Metrics: measures how much  X  Conversion Metrics: measures how much the  X  ROI Metrics: by creating specific ROI values
Furthermore, AdWords allows very complex tar-geting options that can help in many different evalu-ation scenarios:  X  Language (see how message impact can vary in  X  Location (see how message impact can vary in  X  Keyword matching (see how message impact  X  Placements (see how message impact can vary  X  Demographics (see how message impact can 5.1 Setting up an Experiment To test the extent to which AdWords can be ex-ploited, we focused on how to evaluate lexical varia-tions of a message. In particular we were interested in gaining insights about a system for affective varia-tions of existing commentaries on medieval frescoes for a mobile museum guide that attracts the attention of visitors towards specific paintings (Guerini et al., 2008; Guerini et al., 2011b). The various steps for setting up an experiment (or a series of experiments) are as follows:
Choose a Partner . If you have the opportunity to have a commercial partner that already has the in-frastructure for experiments (website, products, etc.) many of the following steps can be skipped. We as-sume that this is not the case.

Choose a scenario . Since you may not be equipped with a VAT code (or with the commercial partner that furnishes the AdWords account and in-frastructure), you may need to  X  X nvent something to promote X  without any commercial aim. If a  X  X ocial marketing X  scenario is chosen you can select  X  X er-sonal X  as a  X  X ax status X , that do not require a VAT code. In our case we selected cultural heritage pro-motion, in particular the frescoes of Torre Aquila ( X  X agle Tower X ) in Trento. The tower contains a group of 11 frescoes named  X  X iclo dei Mesi X  (cy-cle of the months) that represent a unique example of non-religious medieval frescoes in Europe.
Choose an appropriate keyword on which to advertise,  X  X edieval art X  in our case. It is better to choose keywords with enough web traffic in or-der to speed up the experimental process. In our case the search volume for  X  X edieval art X  (in phrase match) was around 22.000 hits per month. Another suggestion is to restrict the matching modality on Keywords in order to have more control over the situations in which ads are displayed and to avoid possible extraneous effects (the order of control for matching modality is: [exact match] ,  X  X hrase match X  and broad match ).

Note that such a technical decision -which key-word to use -is better taken at an early stage of de-velopment because it affects the following steps.
Write messages optimized for that keyword (e.g. including it in the title or the body of the ad). Such optimization must be the same for control and exper-imental condition. The rest of the ad can be designed in such a way to meet control and experimental con-dition design (in our case a message with slightly affective terms and a similar message with more af-fectively loaded variations)
Build an appropriate landing page , according to the keyword and populate the website pages with relevant material. This is necessary to create a  X  X red-ible environment X  for users to interact with. Incorporate meaningful actions in the website . Users can perform various actions on a site, and they can be monitored. The design should include ac-tions that are meaningful indicators of persuasive ef-fect/success of the message. In our case we decided to include some outbound links, representing:  X  general interest:  X  X uonconsiglio Castle site X   X  specific interest:  X  X agle Tower history X   X  activated action:  X  X imetable and venue X   X  complete success:  X  X ook a visit X 
Furthermore, through new Google Analytics fea-tures, we set up a series of time spent on site and number of visited pages thresholds to be monitored in the ACE tool. 5.2 Tips for Planning an Experiment There are variables, inherent in the Google AdWords mechanism, that from a research point of view we shall consider  X  X xtraneous X . We now propose tips for controlling such extraneous variables.

Add negative matching Keywords : To add more control, if in doubt, put the words/expressions of the control and experimental conditions as negative key-words. This will prevent different highlighting be-tween the two conditions that can bias the results. It is not strictly necessary since one can always control which queries triggered a click through the report menu. An example: if the only difference between control and experimental condition is the use of the adjectives  X  gentle knights X  vs.  X  valorous knights X , one can use two negative keyword matches: -gentle and -valorous . Obviously if you are using a key-word in exact matching to trigger your ads, such as [knight] , this is not necessary.

Frequency capping for the display network : if you are running ads on the display network, you can use the  X  X requency capping X  option set to 1 to add more control to the experiment. In this way it is as-sured that ads are displayed only one time per user on the display network.

Placement bids for the search network : unfor-tunately this option is no longer available. Basically the option allowed to bid only for certain positions on the SERPs to avoid possible  X  X xtraneous vari-ables effect X  given by the position. This is best ex-plained via an example: if, for whatever reason, one of the two ads gets repeatedly promoted to the pre-mium position on the SERPs, then the CTR differ-ence between ads would be strongly biased. From a research point of view  X  X remium position X  would then be an extraneous variable to be controlled (i.e. either both ads get an equal amount of premium po-sition impressions, or both ads get no premium po-sition at all). Otherwise the difference in CTR is de-termined by the  X  X remium position X  rather than by the independent variable under investigation (pres-ence/absence of particular affective terms in the text ad). However even if it is not possible to rule out this  X  X osition effect X  it is possible to monitor it by using the report ( Segment &gt; Top vs. other + Experiment ) and checking how many times each ad appeared in a given position on the SERPs, and see if the ACE tool reports any statistical difference in the frequen-cies of ads positions.

Extra experimental time : While planning an ex-periment, you should also take into account the ads reviewing time that can take up to several days, in worst case scenarios. Note that when ads are in eli-gible status, they begin to show on the Google Net-work, but they are not approved yet. This means that the ads can only run on Google search pages and can only show for users who have turned off SafeSearch filtering, until they are approved. Eligible ads cannot run on the Display Network. This status will provide much less impressions than the final  X  X pproved X  sta-tus.

Avoid seasonal periods : for the above reason, and to avoid extra costs due to high competition, avoid seasonal periods (e.g. Christmas time). Delivery method : if you are planning to use the Accelerated Delivery method in order to get the re-sults as quick as possible (in the case of  X  X uick and dirty X  experiments or  X  X ast prototyping-evaluation cycles X ) you should consider monitoring your ex-periment more often (even several times per day) to avoid running out of budget during the day. We ran two pilot experiments to test how affective variations of existing texts alter their persuasive im-pact. In particular we were interested in gaining initial insights about an intelligent system for affec-tive variations of existing commentaries on medieval frescoes.

We focused on adjective variations, using a slightly biased adjective for the control conditions and a strongly biased variation for the experimen-tal condition. In these experiments we took it for granted that affective variations of a message work better than a neutral version (Van Der Sluis and Mel-lish, 2010), and we wanted to explore more finely grained tactics that involve the grade of the vari-ation (i.e. a moderately positive variation vs. an extremely positive variation). Note that this is a more difficult task than the one proposed in (Van Der Sluis and Mellish, 2010), where they were test-ing long messages with lots of variations and with polarized conditions, neutral vs. biased. In addition we wanted to test how quickly experiments could be performed (two days versus the two week sugges-tion of Google).

Adjectives were chosen according to MAX bi-gram frequencies with the modified noun, using the Web 1T 5-gram corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006). Deciding whether this is the best metric for choosing adjectives to modify a noun or not (e.g. also point-wise mutual-information score can be used with a different rationale) is out of the scope of the present paper, but previous work has already used this ap-proach (Whitehead and Cavedon, 2010). Top ranked adjectives were then manually ordered -according to affective weight -to choose the best one (we used a standard procedure using 3 annotators and a recon-ciliation phase for the final decision). 6.1 First Experiment The first experiment lasted 48 hour with a total of 38 thousand subjects and a cost of 30 euros (see Table 1 for the complete description of the experimental setup). It was meant to test broadly how affective variations in the body of the ads performed. The two variations contained a fragment of a commentary of the museum guide; the control condition contained  X  gentle knight X  and  X  African lion X , while in the ex-perimental condition the affective loaded variations were  X  valorous knight X  and  X  indomitable lion X  (see Figure 1, for the complete ads). As can be seen from Table 2, the experiment did not yield any significant result, if one looks at the overall analysis. But seg-menting the results according to the keyword that triggered the ads (see Table 3) we discovered that on the  X  X edieval art X  keyword, the control condition performed better than the experimental one.

Discussion . As already discussed, user moti-vation is a key element for success in such fine-grained experiments: while less focused keywords did not yield any statistically significant differences, the most specialized keyword  X  X edieval art X  was the one that yielded results (i.e. if we display messages like those in Figure 1, that are concerned with me-dieval art frescoes, only those users really interested in the topic show different reaction patterns to the af-fective variations, while those generically interested in medieval times behave similarly in the two con-ditions). In the following experiment we tried to see whether such variations have different effects when modifying a different element in the text.
 6.2 Second Experiment The second experiment lasted 48 hours with a to-tal of one thousand subjects and a cost of 17 euros (see Table 4 for the description of the experimen-tal setup). It was meant to test broadly how affec-tive variations introduced in the title of the text Ads performed. The two variations were the same as in the first experiment for the control condition  X  gentle knight X , and for the experimental condition  X  valor-ous knight X  (see Figure 2 for the complete ads). As can be seen from Table 5, also in this case the experi-ment did not yield any significant result, if one looks at the overall analysis. But segmenting the results according to the search network that triggered the ads (see Table 6) we discovered that on the search partners at the  X  X ther X  position, the control condition performed better than the experimental one. Unlike the first experiment, in this case we segmented ac-cording to the ad position and search network typol-ogy since we were running our experiment only on one keyword in exact match.

Discussion . From this experiment we can confirm that at least under some circumstances a mild af-fective variation performs better than a strong varia-tion. This mild variations seems to work better when user attention is high (the difference emerged when ads are displayed in a non-prominent position). Fur-thermore it seems that modifying the title of the ad rather than the content yields better results: 0.9% vs. 1.83% CTR (  X  2 = 6.24; 1 degree of freedom;  X  &lt; 0,01) even if these results require further assessment with dedicated experiments.

As a side note, in this experiment we can see the problem of extraneous variables: according to AdWords X  internal mechanisms, the experimental condition was displayed more often in the Google search Network on the  X  X ther X  position (277 vs. 219 impressions -and overall 524 vs. 462), still from a research perspective this is not a interesting statisti-cal difference, and ideally should not be present (i.e. ads should get an equal amount of impressions for each position).
 AdWords gives us an appropriate context for evalu-ating persuasive messages. The advantages are fast experiment building and evaluation, fully-automated analysis, and low cost. By using keywords with a low CPC it is possible to run large-scale experiments for just a few euros. AdWords proved to be very ac-curate, flexible and fast, far beyond our expectations. We believe careful design of experiments will yield important results, which was unthinkable before this opportunity for studies on persuasion appeared.
The motivation for this work was exploration of the impact of short persuasive messages, so to assess the effectiveness of different linguistic choices. The experiments reported in this paper are illustrative ex-amples of the method proposed and are concerned with the evaluation of the role of minimal affective variations of short expressions. But there is enor-mous further potential in the proposed approach to ecological crowdsourcing for NLP: for instance, dif-ferent rhetorical techniques can be checked in prac-tice with large audiences and fast feedback. The as-sessment of the effectiveness of a change in the title as opposed to the initial portion of the text body pro-vides a useful indication: one can investigate if vari-ations inside the given or the new part of an expres-sion or in the topic vs. comment (Levinson, 1983) have different effects. We believe there is potential for a concrete extensive exploration of different lin-guistic theories in a way that was simply not realistic before.
