 The importance of uncertain data is growing quickly in many essential applications such as environmental monitor-ing, mobile object tracking and data integration. Recently, storing, collecting, processing, and analyzing uncertain data has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry.
 Analyzing and mining uncertain data needs collaboration and joint effort from multiple research communities. Based on this motivation, we ran the First ACM SIGKDD Work-shop on Knowledge Discovery from Uncertain Data (U X 09) in conjunction with the 2009 SIGKDD International Confer-ence on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD X 09) at Paris.
 The focus of this workshop was to bring together and bridge research in reasoning under uncertainty, probabilistic databases and mining uncertain data. Work in statistics and probabilistic reasoning can provide support with models for representing uncertainty, work in the probabilistic database community can provide methods for storing and managing uncertain data, while work in the mining uncertain data can define data analysis tasks and methods. It is important to build connections among those communities to tackle the overall problem of analyzing and mining uncertain data. There are many common challenges among the communities. One is understanding the different modeling assumptions made, and how they impact the methods, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Different researchers hold different assumptions about the semantics for probabilistic models and uncertainty. This is one of the major obstacles in the research of mining uncertain data. Another challenge is the scalability of proposed management and analysis methods. Finally, to make analysis and mining useful and practical, we need real data sets for testing. Unfortunately, uncertain data sets are often hard to get and hard to share. The theme of this workshop was to make connections among the research areas of probabilistic databases, probabilistic reasoning, and data mining, as well as to build bridges among the aspects of models, data, applications, novel min-ing tasks and effective solutions. By making connections among different communities, we aim at understanding each other in terms of scientific foundation as well as commonal-ity and differences in research methodology.
 Although the workshop was allocated to only half day, we had a very dynamic and exciting program. The workshop was among one of the best attended ones in conjunction interesting techniques, including an UF-tree data structure and a mining algorithm to push user constraints into the mining process.
 Namata and Getoor, in their paper titled  X  X dentifying Graphs from Noisy and Incomplete Data X , introduced an interesting graph identification problem  X  how to model the inference of a  X  X leaned X  output network from a noisy in-put graph. They used an illustrative example to analyze the types of inferences involved and the inherent challenges. They also gave a simple yet general approach to the prob-lem.
 The paper  X  X earning from Data with Uncertain Labels by Boosting Credal Classifiers X  by Quost and Den X ux tackles the supervised learning problem when training data is asso-ciated with uncertain labels. Their approach uses the theory of belief functions and boosting techniques. A variant of the AdaBoost method is developed.
 Dudas and Bostr  X om presented an application of mining un-certain data in their paper  X  X sing Uncertain Chemical and Thermal Data to Predict Product Quality in a Casting Pro-cess X . The uncertainty comes from the fact that the mea-surements cannot be directly aligned since they are collected at different time points. The authors used random forests to handle uncertain numeric feature values represented by intervals.
 In the paper titled  X  X n Perturbation Theory and an Algo-rithm for Maximal Clique Enumeration in Uncertain and Noisy Graphs X , Hendrix, Schmidt, Breimyer, and Samatova considered the problem of maximal clique enumeration in the context of networks based on noisy or uncertain data. They proposed an algorithm that solves the maximal clique enumeration problem on altered or perturbed graphs with correctness guarantee and remarkable performance improve-ment over the traditional enumeration techniques in the cases of adding and removing edges from protein interac-tion data.
 The paper  X  X xploiting Contexts to Deal with Uncertainty in Classification X  by Zadrozny, Pappa, Meira, Gon  X calves, Rocha, and Salles discusses how to account for uncertainty in classification methods, particularly when data attributes may not be accurate for classifying a given sample. They proposed a lazy classification strategy which incorporates the uncertainty into both the training phase and the classi-fication phase, and extended the traditional KNN approach using the strategy.
 In the paper titled  X  X azy Naive Credal Calssifier X , Corani and Zaffalon proposed a local or lazy version of the na  X  X ve credal classifier. The classifier retains good reliability even on small amounts of data carrying highly uncertain infor-mation.
 In the paper titled  X  X ecision Support and Profit Predic-tion for Online Auction Sellers X , Chang and Lin presented another interesting application where uncertainty plays an important role. In order to obtain genuine sold probabil-ity and end-price, they applied probability calibration and sample selection bias correction when building the predic-tion models.
 The workshop is just impossible without the great contribu-tions by the authors, the excellent program committee, the external reviewers, and the attendees. We sincerely thank the authors who submitted to the workshop and the atten-dees of the workshop. We are deeply grateful to the pro-
