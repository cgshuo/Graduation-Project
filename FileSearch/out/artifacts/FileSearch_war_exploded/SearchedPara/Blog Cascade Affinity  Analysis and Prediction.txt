 Information propagation within the blogosphere is of much importance in implementing policies, marketing research, launchingnew products,and otherapplications. Inthispa-per, we take a microscopic view of the information propa-gation pattern in blogosphere by investigating blog cascade affinity .A blog cascade is a group of posts linked together discussing about the same topic, and cascade affinity refers to the phenomenon of a blog X  X  inclination to join a specific cascade. We identify and analyze an array of features that may affect a blogger X  X  cascade joining behavior and utilize thesefeaturestopredictcascadeaffinityofblogs. Evaluated on a real dataset consisting of 873,496 posts, our svm -based prediction achieved accuracy of 0.723 measured by  X  1 .Our experiments also showed that among all features identified, the number of friends was the most important factor affect-ing bloggers X  inclination to join cascades.

The popularity of blogs has been increasing dramatically over the last few years. According to a recent report by a half of the Internet users read blogs. Technorati have indexed more than 133 million blogs since 2002, and have tracked blogs in 81 languages by June, 2008. Blogs con-tain diverse varieties of information. General topics include personal diaries, experiences, opinions, information technol-ogy,andpolitics tonameafew. Duetotheiraccessible and timely nature, many bloggers surveyed have advertisement on their blogs. The mean annual revenue for blogs with ad-vertisementisestimatedtobe$6,000[19]. Thisfigurejumps to$75,000whenweconsideronlythoseblogshaving100,000 or more unique visitors per month. Thus, blogosphere pro-videslargeamountoflatestinformationontheWebandisof muchimportanceinviralmarketingandon-lineadvertising.
A blog consists of several entries. Each entry within a blog, called a post , is time-stamped and the most recent entries always appear at the top. Bloggers can also create hyperlinks to other blogs or websites in their posts. The universe of all these blogs and their interconnections is of-ten referred to as blogosphere [18, 19]. Blogosphere is an intuitive source for data involving the spread of informa-tion and influence within the ne twork of bloggers [1, 7, 11, 18]. By analyzing the linking patterns from one blog post to another, we can infer the way information is propagated through the blog network over the Web. In particular, a piece of information flows from a post to another along the hyperlink between them. For example, consider the Fig-ure 1(a). The ellipses represent different blogs ( e.g.,  X   X  ,  X  4 ,  X  5 ,and  X  6 ), and each ellipse contains a set of posts. The edges in the figure indicate hyperlinks between posts. Assume that post  X  1 in blog  X  1 contains opinion about re-cent events related to the spread of h1n1 virus .Sometime later, blog  X  2 visited  X  1 and wrote a post  X  2 in response to this topicof discussion andexplicitly created a hyperlinkto  X  . Subsequently, new posts will join this conversation by linkingtoexistingposts. Forinstance,attime  X  0 ,thestruc-ture of this conversation related to h1n1 virus containing a group of posts(  X  1 ,  X  2 ,  X  3 ,and  X  4 )isdepictedbythedashed rectangular component in Figure 1(a). Aggregating all the linked posts by backtracking the hyperlinks will result in a dag (Directed Acyclic Graph), where each node is a post. Such a dag is called a cascade [14, 20] (also known as con-versation tree). All the posts in the same cascade typically discuss about a similar topic.

Observethatattime  X  0 there were two blogs,  X  5 and  X  6 , which did not join the conversation on h1n1 virus by writ-ing a post and linking to the cascade. Now assume that at time  X  1 &gt; X  0  X  6 joined the cascade by writing a post  X  andlinkingitexplicitlyto  X  2 . Themodifiedstructureofthe cascade is now depicted in Figure 1(b). Notice that  X  5 still did not join the conversation. Why did  X  6 join the cascade but  X  5 did not? Is it possible to predict the cascade affinity of  X  5 and  X  6 by analyzing the information embedded in the cascade at time  X  0 ? In order to provide answers to these questions, in this paper we propose an svm -based technique that analyze an array of cascade features to predict which blogs are highly likely to join the cascade in the future .We refertothephenomenonofablog X  X inclinationtojoinaspe-cific cascade as cascade affinity . In the sequel, we shall use blog and blogger interchangeably in the context of cascade affinity.

Although the notion of information cascade was formally introduced by Sushil Bikhchandani [4], it was first system-atically studied in the context of blogosphere by Kumar et al. [11]. Majority of research on blog cascades [14] have focused their attention at the macroscopic level. In partic-ular, these efforts investigated information flow in cascades, common shapes of cascades and their frequencies, and per-formed a series of topological analysis. In contrast, we take a microscopic viewbyanalyzingcascadeaffinitybehaviorof individualbloggers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that undertakes a systematic study to predict such behavior.

The knowledge of a blogger X  X  affinity to cascades is useful in several applications. It not only facilitates the design of advanced blogging system with more sophisticated person-alized recommendations and filters, but also help us to set upintelligentstrategiesinon-lineadvertising. Bypredicting whichblogshavestrongeraffinitytoacascade,wecanmake recommendationstothosebloggersincasetheyhavenotyet readanypostinthecascade. Consequently,wecaninfluence thepopulationfasterbyacceleratingtheinformationpropa-gation process. Inthisway,newservicesorproductscanbe disseminatedandpopularizedinashortertime. Further,we can also predict to what scale of population a cascade will finallyexpandsothatwhendisseminatinganadvertisement along blog cascade we can understand thefinaleffect of the advertisement ahead of time and adjust our advertisement strategy accordingly.
At first glance, it may seem that we can predict a blog-ger X  X  affinity to a cascade by analyzing the textual content of existing posts in the cascade and estimating the over-lap between the content of the blogger X  X  previous posts and cascade content. However, such content-aware strategy is computationally expensiveand may adversely affect theac-curacy of predictionfor several reasons. Firstly, thecontent of posts are often in conversational language containing fla-vors of abbreviated words and local lingo. Secondly, a blog cascademayconsistsofpostswrittenin differentlanguages. Thirdly,postsmay only contain multimediaobjects suchas pictures or video clips. Consequently, these factors make content analysis significantly challenging. Hence, we take a content-oblivious strategy to address this issue.
Weproposeagroupofcontent-obliviousfeaturesofablog cascade that may influence a blog X  X  affinity to the cascade. These features are as follows: number of friends that are already inthecascade, popularity of participants in thecas-cade, number of participants in the cascade, time elapsed since the genesis of the cascade, and citing factor of the blog. Note that all these features can be computed by ana-lyzing only the link structure and topology of the cascade. For each of the proposed feature, we investigate how it in-fluencesablog X  X affinitytothegivencascadeandperformed a one-way analysis of variance ( anova )totestthesignifi-cance of each feature X  X  influence. Then we present an svm classification-based approach that exploits these features to predict the probabilities of blogs X  affinity to a cascade and rank them accordingly. Although we did not exploit the contentoftheposts,ourexperimentalresultsdemonstrated thatourpredictionstrategycangeneratehighqualityresults (  X  1-measure of 72%). In summary, the main contributions in this paper are as follows.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief review of related work. In Section 3, we introducethedatasetaswellasthecascadeextractionpro-cess. We propose a group of features for modeling cascade affinityofeachbloggerinSection4. InSection5wedescribe ourproposedtechniquetomeasureandranktheprobability of a blog to join a cascade.

Similarworkhavebeendone withinlargeonlinesocialnetworksrecentlyfocusingonmod-eling the word-of-mouth effect in different social networks. Backstrom et al. [2] showed the probability of joining a so-cial community depends on the number of acquaintances already in it. Leskovec et al.

There is a saturation point atthevalueof10,whichmeansafterapersonreceives 10 recommendations on buying a particular dvd , the prob-ability of buying does not increase anymore. Cha et al.

These above work all focused on the number of friends feature. This feature is also used in our work to modeltheprobabilityofablog X  X affinitytoacascade. Addi-tionally,asweshallseelater,ourworkexaminessomeother features that may affect this behavior.

Several recent papers have focused on modeling the in-formation diffusion patterns within social networks, which is considered to play a significant role in political science and viral marketing [20]. In particular, several algorithms are proposed to find a set of nodes which have the most influence on the others so that by selecting those nodes as seeds we can make our piece of information spread over a large population [8, 10]. Gruhl et al. [7] modeled the in-formation diffusion within blogosphere by defining a read probability and copy probability for each blogger, and itera-tively computed the two and finally converged to the best solution. Agarwal et al. [1] proposed a ranking function for theblogsaccordingtotheirinfluencebasedonthe influence of posts appeared in each blog. The influence of a post is computedbasedonitslength,comments,anda propagation factor whichistheaggre gated influencefrom thepoststhat linkedtoandfromthecurrentone. AnotherresearchbyMa et al. [15] focused on finding a set of  X  candidates as target for marketing strategy using heat diffusion models.
Ourresearchdiffersfromthesestudiesintwoways. Firstly, thesecurrentapproachesmainlyfocusedonfindingthemost influent ialblogs inblogos phere[1], wh ile oursistargetedon discoveringtheblogsthataremostprobablytobeinfluenced by other blogs. Hence, our work is orthogonal to these ef-forts. A recent study showed that large-scale changes in public opinion are not driven by highly influential people who influence everyone else but by easily influenced people influencing other easily influenced people [21]. The authors investigated at a global scale the average size of cascades that are initiated by influential nodes and average nodes using different influence models. They showed that early adopters enrolled in a cascade is more important to affect the final cascade size than the initiators. Our work differs from it in that we study in detail under what situation a blogger will be i nfluenced as well as to retrieve the most easily influenced individuals. Secondly, in our work we pro-pose a group of features of blogs and cascades to model the probability of a blog to join a cascade.

In a recent work, Karagiannis et al. [9] studied the hu-manbehaviorrelatedtoemail responses. They showedthat the email replying probability dependsonaseries of factors. By conditioning on each individual factor, they can achieve moderatepredictiongainswithrespecttopredictingreplied emails. Putting together all the factors achieves a signif-icant prediction gain. In contrast, our work analyzed the joining behavior of each individual blogger using a group of features. Additionally, we also proposed a ranking scheme thatcancomputetheprobabilityofablogtojoinacascade.
In this section, we first introduce the real-world data set we haveused for our study. Then, we present our approach of cascade extraction from the data set. In the sequel, we shall use the notations shown in Table 1 to represent differ-ent concepts. Generally, we shall use superscript to denote acascadeidentifierandsubscripttodenoteablogidentifier. We extracted our blog data set in September, 2008 using from June, 2008 to September, 2008. We first selected the groupoftop100blogsindexedbyTechnoratiasseeds. From these seeds, we retrieved the blogs that had linked to these seeds in their posts, and then we iteratively retrieve the posts that linked to the previous level till the sixth level which has been shown as the upper boundary size for most chaincascades[14]. Fromthe xml collectionofblogs,wecan getthepost-to-postrelationships.

So we additionally extracted blog-to-blog relationships with weighted edges where the weight of an edgefrom  X   X  to  X   X  indicatesthenumberoftimes  X   X  hascited  X   X  X posts.

 Algorithm 1 : Cascade extraction algorithm.
 Input : A set of post-to-post relations
Output : A set of isolated cascades  X  = {  X  1 , X  2 ,..., X   X  } begin end not participate in any cascade are excluded from our data set. Figure 2(a) shows the in-degree distribution of blogs indexed by Technorati till September, 2008. This figure is plotted using the information extracted from our data set. Itisshowntofollow apowerlawdistributionwithexponent equal to  X  1 . 505, while in [14] this exponent is reported to be  X  1 . 7. Suchaphenomenonindicatesafewblogsaremore connected than the rest. It is consistent with the result of  X  X referential attachment X  X odel (rich get richer) [3].
Recall that each blog participates in a cascade by writing a post which links to another post that is already in the cascade. Wedenoteasetof cascades as  X  = {  X  1 , X  2 ,..., X   X  } . The algorithm for extracting cascades from our data set is shown in Algorithm 1.

Note that the proposed cascades extraction procedure is slightlydifferentfromtheonedescribedin[14]. Letuselab-orate on this further. Consider the scenario in Figure 3(a) which depicts posts and hyperlinks between them. Based on [14], each cascade should have only one initiator (top-most post). Hence, the scenario illustrated in Figure 3(a) have to be considered as two different cascades (have two initiators  X  1 and  X  2 )asdepictedinFigure3(b). Incontrast, we treat the scenario in Figure 3(a) as one cascade. The intuitivejustification for this isas follows. Observethatthe postsinFigure3(a)arealllinkedtogether. Thatis,both  X  1 Figure 3: Different approaches for cascades extrac-tion: (a) observedpost-to-post relationship, itisalso the cascade identified by our approach; (b) the cas-cades identified from (a) using the approach in [14]. and  X  2 share some common posts in the conversation ( e.g.,  X  ). This may indicate that all these posts are discussing about a common topic. Hence, it makes sense to consider them as part of a single cascade instead of separating them into different ones.

The next step is to post-process the extracted cascades to eliminate the ones which have been there not more than a month till the time  X   X  . The set of  X  X atured X  cascades extracted after the post-processing is represented as:  X  = {  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  30 } . The number of cascades detected after filtering out the immature ones is shown in Table 2. The reason for post-processing the cascade set is as follows. We need to ensure that the extracted cascades can provide a robust and accurate framework for feature extraction and subsequent prediction. However, quantifying values of dif-ferentfeaturesbasedonimmaturecascades(cascadeswhich havenotabsorbedallpotentialparticipants)willdistortthe prediction accuracy of cascade affinity. Many participants may join these cascades after time  X   X  and consequently ad-versely affect the modeling of the ground truth based on the features set. Obviously, this may result in a deviation between our knowledge about the participants of these cas-cades and the ground truth. It is worth mentioning that it isnotpossibletojustifythepredictionperformancewithout knowing the ground truth.

Figure 2(b) shows the distribution of cascade size ex-tracted from our data set. It is defined as the number of blogs within a cascade. The  X  -axis is the different sizes of cascades and the  X  -axis represents the number of cascades. number of quasi X  X riends Joining probability by cascade rank.
 The minimum size of cascades is defined as 2 which is the trivialcase, whilethemaximumsizeofacascadeisfoundto be 34 in our data set. The distribution of cascade size also follows a power law. The exponent found in our data set is  X  3 . 1, while this exponent is found to be  X  2 in the data set used by Leskovec et al. [14]. This deviation is due to the differences between the characteristics of the two data sets anddifferentdefinitionofacascadeinthesetwoapproaches.
Inthissection,wefirstpresentanarrayofcontent-oblivious cascade features that may influence a blog X  X  affinity to a cascade. Then, we conduct a one-way variance analysis ( anova ) on each of these features to quantify their signifi-cance related to cascade affinity.
Firstwepresenttheroleofthe elapsed time . Informally, it refers to the difference between the time a blogger joins a cascade and the cascade creation time. Formally, it is defined as follows.

Definition 1. Let  X   X  (  X  ) be the time a blogger  X   X  cascade  X   X  .Let  X   X  be the time of creation of  X   X  .Then,the elapsed time, denoted as  X   X  (  X  ) , is defined as follows:
We use day as the unit of elapsed time as most bloggers write posts once per day. The distribution of this feature is shown in Figure 2(c). The  X  -axis represents the time elapsedindays,whilethe  X  -axis represents the number of blogs that join cascades at a specific elapsed time. Observe that91%bloggersjoinacascadeduringthefirstweek. After that affinity to cascades drops almost exponentially with elapsedtime. Notethattheaboveresultsdeviatefromother types of social networks, shown in [13], where the authors found that the average number of edges attached to each node did not change much over the lifetime of the node.
We introduce the notion of quasi-friend to model friend-ship within blogosphere based on post citings. Formally, quasi-friend is defined as follows.

Definition 2. Given two blogs  X  1 and  X  2 ,  X  1 is a quasi-friend of  X  2 if and only if  X  2 cites  X  1  X  X  posts more than  X  times.

A quasi-friend indicates that  X  2 probably often reads  X  1 blog. This probability of frequent reading is controlled by thefriendshipthreshold  X  . Obviously,  X  willaffectthenum-ber of quasi-friends discovered. As shown in Figure 4(a),  X  affectsthenumberofquasi-friendsexponentiallywithexpo-nent  X  =  X  3 . 37. Noticethatifweset  X  toalargevaluethen we may extract a very limited numberof quasi-friends for a blog. Hence, we set  X  to 2 by default. We shall justify this value empirically in Section 6.2. Note that quasi-friendship is directed .Thatis,  X  2 isnotaquasi-friendof  X  1 unless  X  cited  X  2 more than  X  times. Given a value of  X  ,wedenote the set of quasi-friends of a blog  X   X  as  X   X  = {  X  1 , X  2 where each element  X   X  is a blog.

Several recent papers have shown that personal behavior in a social network is highly affected by the person X  X  neigh-bors [2, 5, 12]. Hence, the number of friends a blogger may have in a cascade is an important feature that may influ-ence her decision to join the cascade. Na  X   X vely, the number of friends a blogger has in a cascade can be computed at any time after she has joined the cascade. However, this may mislead us from the actual phenomenon as the num-ber of friends is highly influenced by the temporal state of the cascade. Let us elaborate on this further. Consider the Figure 5(a). Each node is a blog and the dashed rectan-gle denotes a cascade at a particular time. Edges represent hyperlinks related to this cascade. Assume that a blog  X  joined it at time  X  0 .Notethatattime  X  0 ,  X  did not have anyfriendinthatcascade.Wereferto  X  0 as joining time . Now assume that at time  X  0 + X   X  node  X  became a friend of  X  as shown in Figure 5(b). We refer to this time when a friendship is created as friendship creation time .Observe that the number of friends  X  had during joining time and friendship creation time may be different. However, if we discard these two different phenomenons, then at any time Figure 6: Effect of friendship creation time (contd.). after  X  0 + X   X  itmayseemthat  X  hadafriend  X  inthiscom-munity when she joined it (Figure 5(c)). Obviously, this is notanaccuratereflectionofthegroundtruth. Notethatex-istingworkignorethesetwotypesoftemporalfeatureswhile modeling number of friends in a social network. There is another problem if we ignore the above temporal behavior. ConsidertheFigure6(a),whichrepresentsthesamescenario asdepictedinFigure5(a). Nowassumethatanotherblog  X  , whois afriend of  X  ,joinedthiscommunityattime  X  0 + X   X  as shown in Figure 6(b). If we do not distinguish between times  X  0 and  X  0 + X   X  ,thenitmayseemthat  X  hadafriend  X  in the cascade when she joined it (Figure 6(c)). However, the truth is that when  X  joined this cascade at time  X  0 ,she did not have any friend. Hence in our approach, we distin-guish between the joining time and the friendship creation time to accurately reflect the ground truth. As we shall see in Section 6.2, this distinction improvesthe cascade affinity prediction performance significantly.

In our approach, we represent the set of blogs having  X  quasi-friends in a cascade  X   X  using  X   X  (  X  ) taking into consid-eration the time  X   X  (  X  ). It is computed as follows.  X  (  X   X  (  X  ))denotesthesetofblogsthatbecameaquasi-friend appearedin  X   X  beforetime  X   X  (  X  ). Notethatbyincorporating  X   X  (  X  ) in our approach, we make a contribution to address the above issues (Fig 5(c) and Fig 6(c)). Based on  X   X  (  X  ), wedefinethenotionof cascade affinity ratio with respectto the number of quasi-friends.

Definition 3. Given the set of  X   X  (  X  ) , the cascade affinity ratio, denoted as  X   X  , is defined as:
Wecomputed  X   X  forthewholecollection ofcascades,and plottedthevaluesinFigure4(b). The  X  -axisisthe  X  value (number of quasi-friends in a cascade). The  X  -axis repre-sentsthevaluesof  X   X  . Fromthefigure,weobserveadimin-ishing return phenomenon. That is, beyond a number each additional quasi-friends in the cascade will contribute less to the probability of joining that cascade. This number is around 7 in this figure. Note that the curve showed in the figurefollowssimilartrendasfoundinothersocialnetworks in [2], and also in [12] where the author found a saturation point in the probability of buying a dvd by the number of recommendations received.
Next we study the effect of popularity of cascade partici-pants on the cascade affinity of a blogger. The idea is sim-ilar to the preferential attachment model which was first proposed in [3]. In this model, whenever a new vertex ar-rives in a network it attaches an edge to an existing vertex with a probability proportional to that of the old vertex X  X  degree. Newmanperformedaseriesofanalysisonthemodel in [17]. Leskovec et al. [13] also showed a similar pattern in some real-world data sets. Here we conduct an analysis based on this model. However, in our study when a blog joins a cascade we consider the model at the cascade-level whereas the above approaches consider it at the node level. Then, the popularity of a cascade  X   X  is the highest rank of the blogs in the cascade. Formally, it is defined as follows.
Definition 4. Let  X  (  X  ) be the rank of a blog  X  . Then the popularity rank of a cascade  X   X  that  X   X  wants to join, denoted as  X   X  (  X   X  ) , is defined as:
Note that the rank of each blog is based on its in-degree (indexedbyTechnorati). Abloghavingthelargestin-degree hasthehighestrankas1. Observethattheabovedefinition can be intuitively explained from the social aspect. When a blogger  X   X  reads a post  X   X  she can also see other posts in the same cascade by tracing back the hyperlinks. If there is a popular blog which has a large in-degree in that cascade, then  X   X  will probably join this cascade. Interestingly, this effect is not so obvious in our result shown in Figure 4(c). The  X  -axis in the figure is the popularity rank of cascades. A cascade havinglower rank means it contains a morepop-ular blog. We plot the numbersof blogs that join a cascade ( X  X ositive count X ) and those who do not ( X  X egative count X ) byvaryingtheranks. Thecurvelabeled X  X robability X  X epre-sents the ratio: positivecount positivecount in the figure although the values along  X  -axisisinlog-scale, the number of joined blogs in each bin do not vary much. This phenomenon indicates that a minority of cas-cades which have high popularity ranks influence a large number of bloggers to join.
Intuitively, a blogger may have stronger affinity to a cas-cade which has absorbed a lot of participants. Hence, we now conduct an analysis using number of participants in a cascade as a feature. We computethe probability of joining a cascade as a function of the number of participants exist-ing in the cascade. The number of participants is formally defined as follows.

Definition 5. Let  X   X  (  X  ) be the time when a blog  X   X  joins a cascade  X   X  . Then, the number of participants in  X   X  at time  X   X  (  X  ) , denoted as  X   X  (  X   X  ) , is defined as:
Figure 7 shows the probability of joining a cascade as a function of thenumberof participantsin that cascade. The number of blogs inside a cascade ranges from 1 to 33. The probabilityofjoiningacascadewith  X  participants,referred Figure 7: Cascadeaffinityprobabilityversuscascade size. to as cascade affinity probability (denoted as  X  X  X  X  (  X  )), can be computed as follows.
Weseparatethecascadessizerangeinto11binseachwith length 3. The height of each bar denotes the mean of the threecascadeaffinityprobabilityvaluesinsidethatbin. No-tice that at the beginning, as the number of participants grows, the probability slightly grows, but after some point, the probability drops down. There is a peak at the point of cascadeswiththesize13  X  15. Itindicatesthatbeforeacas-cadeabsorbed13  X  15participants,theprobabilityforablog to join this cascade increases. This represents the cascade initiation period where many new blogs keep on joining the cascade. However, after the number of participants in the cascade has reached a value between 13 and 15, the proba-bility of a blog joining this cascade drops down to a stable value. This represents the stable period after a cascade has got enough attention.
Thefeaturesdiscussedaboveareallrelatedtothecascade that a blog is inclined to join. Here we analyze a personal characteristics related to the joining behavior of each blog-ger. The reason for analyzing this feature is based on the hypothesis that a blogger  X   X  is more inclined to join a cas-cade if  X   X  likes to cite others X  posts.
 Definition 6. Let  X  X  X  X  (  X  ) be the number of outlinks of  X  . Then the citing factor of a blogger  X   X  , denoted as  X   X  (  X   X  ) ,is defined as:
We can computethe probability for a blog  X   X  with  X  cita-tions to join a cascade as follows.
The result is shown in Figure 8. It is distributed almost uniformly with the change to the number of out-links. It is evident that this feature is not very informative as far as cascade affinity is concerned.
We now perform a series of variance analysis on each of these features. For each feature, we compare the values be-tween blogs which finally joined a cascade and those did Figure 8:  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  (  X  ) versus number of citations. not using the one-way analysis of variance ( anova )totest whetherthedifferenceisreally caused bythefeature values orjustbynoiseinthedata. TheFand p -valuesforeachfea-ture is shown in Table 3. The result shows that the p -value for citation factor is 0 . 968 while other features are all less than 0 . 05. It indicates that the different values of citation factor in both groups should only be considered as noise. The remaining four cascade features are all significant for predicting cascade affinity of a blogger.
In this section, we describe how the features discussed inprevioussectioncanbeexploitedtopredictbloggers who mayjoinacascade. Thepredictioninvolvestwosteps,namely candidate blog extraction and cascade joining prediction .We elaborate on these steps in turn.
For a given cascade, all blogs in the blogosphere are po-tential blogs that may join the cascade in the future. Nev-ertheless, many of these potential blogs have no interaction ( e.g., read the posts) with the blogs/posts already in the cascade and are unlikely to join the cascade. We therefore only consider a muchsmaller set of candidate blogs that are likely to read one or more posts in the cascade. The can-didate blogs are those that have at least one quasi-friend in the given cascade. Formally, for a given cascade  X   X  ,the candidate blogs  X  X  X  X  X  X  (  X   X  )thatmayjoin  X   X  is given by the following equation. The algorithm for extracting candidate blogs is shown in Algorithm 2. Recall that quasi-friend is defined based on thenumberoftimes( i.e.,  X  )ablogcitespostsfromanother blog. Hence, the number of candidate blogs extracted for a given cascade naturally dependson thethreshold  X  .Inour experiments, we set  X  =2 by default.

For all cascades in our data set, there are 312 , 414 candi-date blogs extracted by Algorithm 2. On average, 43 candi-Algorithm 2 : Candidate blog extraction algorithm.

Particularly, for a cascade having fewer than 10 participants,thereare 39candidateblogs onaverage; for a cascade having 11  X  20 participants, this value increases to64candidatesonaverage;foracascadehavingmorethan 20 participants, there are 81 candidates on average. From the numbersreported, candidate blog extraction greatly re-ducesthenumberofblogstobeconsideredintheprediction withrespecttothetotalnumberofblogsinourdataset. As an evaluation of candidate extraction, Table 4 shows 76.1% blogs that join a cascade have at least a quasi-friend in it when we set  X  =2.
AsdiscussedinSection1, inadvertising weneedtoselect a limited set of blogs that have the highest probability of joining a cascade. Ideally, we would like to computea score for each candidate blog extracted with respect to a cascade indicating its likelihood of joining the cascade.
Based on the features identified in the preceding section, the prediction task can be naturally formulated as a bi-naryclassificationtask. Manyexistingclassifiers( e.g., Na  X   X ve Bayes,  X  -Nearest Neighbors, and SupportVectorMachines) indeed return a category relevance score for each data in-stance to be classified indicating its likelihood of belonging to a pre-definedcategory.

Inourexperiments,weadoptedSupportVectorMachines ( svm ) classifier [22] due to its promising results reported in many data mining/machine learning tasks. The training of svm learnsahyperplanethatseparatesthepositivetraining examples from the negative ones with the largest margin. The hyperplane is defined by a vector w and a parameter  X  to be learned from the training data. The learned model computesascoreforanunlabeledobject x usingitsdecision function  X  ( x )= w  X  x  X   X  . In our setting, a larger  X  (  X  indicatesmorelikelihoodof  X   X  joiningthetargetcascade. To learnan svm classifier,thosecandidateblogsthateventually joined and did not join the target cascades were used as positive and negative examples, respectively.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the features in predicting cascade affinity of candidate blogs, we conducted experi-mentson ourdatasetusing 5-fold cross validation. Thatis, the data set was randomly partitioned into 5 parts and in each evaluation, 4 parts were used as training data and the
Value of  X  Candidate size  X  =1 946,329 (0.916) 0.702  X  =2 312,414 (0.761) 0.723  X  =3 80,482 (0.242) 0.227 remaining part was used as test data. The results reported are averaged over the 5 runs.

The commonly used performance evaluation measures in classification tasks are precision , recal l and  X  1 .Precision, denoted by  X  X  X  , is the percentage of blogs that eventually joined the target cascade among all blogs predicted to be joining. Recall, denoted by  X  X  X  ,is thepercentageof thecor-rect predictions among all blogs that eventually joined the target cascade. Note that, recall is computed with respect to all blogs that finally joined the target cascade regard-lessofwhethertheblogsareidentifiedascandidateblogsor andrecall. However,bothprecisionandrecallarethreshold-dependent. Ahigherthresholdleadstohigherprecision but lower recall. In our experiments, we are more interested in the effectiveness of the features in ranking the candidate blogs according to the likelihood of joining the target cas-cade. Wetherefore adoptedthearea underPrecision-Recall curve ( auc-pr ) as the evaluation metric.
Justification of candidate set. Recall that the num-berofcandidateblogsisaffectedbytheparameter  X  .As  X  increases, the number of quasi-friends identified decreases. Consequently, the candidate blog set shrinks. As a result, the maximum recall decreases, but the prediction perfor-mancemaynot. Todeterminetheoptimumvaluefor  X  ,we conductedthepredictionusingdifferentvaluesof  X  .Table4 shows thesizes of candidateblogsets for different  X  as well as the highest  X  1 -measures achieved by selecting the best SVM thresholds. Observe that best  X  1 -measure is achieved for  X  = 2. Hence, in the subsequent experiments we shall set  X  =2.

Comparison of feature sets. Recallthatwehaveiden-tified five features for cascade affinity prediction, namely number of friends , popularity of participants , number of par-ticipants , citing factor ,and elapsed time .Toevaluatedthe effectiveness of these features, we conducted 6 sets of ex-periments. The first set of experiments used all 5 features for prediction. This feature set is denoted by X  X LL X  X n Ta-ble 5. In each of the following fiveexperiments, one feature is removed. For instance, X  X -NF X  X enotes that the feature number of friends is removed and the remaining four fea-tures were used for prediction. In Table 5, a  X   X   X  indicates that the feature is used and  X - X  otherwise.

The predictionperformances measuredby auc-pr are re-portedinthelastrowinTable5. Usingallthefivefeatures, the prediction achieved auc-pr of 0 . 599. The following ob-servations are made: Figure 9: Precision-Recall Curves for different fea-tures. Figure 10: Precision, Recall and  X  1 -measure for X  X -CF X . For the completeness of the results, Figure 9 plots the Precision-Recall curves of using six different feature sets. Allthefiveruns(exceptfor X  X -NF X )achievedalmostperfect precision before recall reached0 . 57. Sharpdrop of precision is then observed along with the increase of recall.
Figure 10 shows the precision, recall and  X  1 -measure by varying the threshold for the feature set X  X -CF X , which has the best prediction performance among all the approaches. Figure 11: Significance of time for modeling number of friends.

 Recall that in Section 4.2, we illustrated the significance of timeinmodelingthenumberoffriends. Tojustifythegood-ness of oursolution, we compared it with theapproach that ignores time. Specifically, if we discard temporal issue in modeling quasi-friends then the definition of  X   X  (  X  ) (the set ofblogshaving  X  friendsincascade  X   X  )ismodifiedasfollows.
Weupdatedthe number of friends feature in each can-didate vector using the above formula. Using the updated feature vectors, we performed the prediction again. The performance of ignoring the time in quasi-friend identifica-tionshowsasmall auc-pr 0.203whereasourproposedsolu-tion achieves0.599. Thecomparison between thePrecision-Recall curve of this approach and our proposed solution is shown in Figure 11. Both of the curves use all the five features.  X  X RTM X  represents the approach that discards the temporal aspects in number of friends . It is clear that time is an important factor in quasi-friend identification as it achieved significantly better prediction compared to the approach that ignores time.

Prediction of top-k bloggers.

Specifically, for each cascade  X   X  havingmorethan  X  positivesamples, we generate the top- X  predicted blogs and compute the preci-sion as follows:  X  X  X   X  (  X  )= # true positive  X  .Thenforagiven  X  , we compute the average precision , denoted as  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  (  X  ), using the following formula. Table 6 shows average precision values for different  X  val-ues highlighting the goodness of our approach. Note that  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  (  X  ) may not monotonically decrease with increasing  X  as the number of cascades in the denominator depends on  X  .

Inthispaper,weanalyzedalargepubliclyavailablecollec-tions of blog information, to investigate bloggers X  behavior and interaction with blog cascades. We have identified in total five features, namely number of friends, popularity of participants, numberof participants, time elapsed since the genesisofthecascade,andcitingfactoroftheblog,thatmay play important role in predicting blog cascade affinity so as to identify most ea sily influenc ed bloggers. Such bloggers play important role in several real-world applications such as viral marketing. Note that our proposed features are de-rived from structural information of the cascades without any content analysis of posts/blogs. We performed anova test on these features and showed that all of them, except citation factor, have significant impact on cascade affinity. The cascade affinity prediction is then formulated as a clas-sification task and svm classifier is employed in our experi-ments. Usingtheprediction scores from svm ,thecandidate blogs can be ranked according to their probability of join-ing a cascade. We have evaluated different combinations of the features and our results on cascade affinity prediction is consistent with the anova test. The four features that havesignificantimpactoncascadeaffinityachievedthebest prediction accuracy of 0.603 measured by auc-pr .Ourex-perimental results also showed that the number of friends plays a significant role in blog cascade affinity prediction.
Aspartoffuturework,weintendtoinvestigatehowtoex-ploit cascade contents effectively along with structural fea-tures for predicting cascade affinity. In particular, recent results showed that cascade types may indicate the genre of the content in a cascade [16]. We wish to exploit them in the context of cascade affinity prediction.
