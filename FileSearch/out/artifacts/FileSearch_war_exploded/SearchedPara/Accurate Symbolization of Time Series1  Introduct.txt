 Recently, there has been a renewed interest in managing and mining time series [1, 2, 3]. Symbolization of time series is a very useful tool in this field, and had been extensively studied for various data mining tasks [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Firstly, it is very important in analyzing time series on the high level. Secondly, it provides a tie between the task of mining time series and most techniques that were originally designed for handling symbolic sequence.
 ual subseries into a typical subseries. Obviously, its performance can be evaluated by its capability in accurately retrieving and representing the subjective notion on the movements in time series. A simple solution is to choose the typical sub-series manually based on the domain expert X  X  analysis and explanation, and then use this domain knowledge in symbolizing time series. However, manual extrac-tion of the typical subseries is usually a very difficult, or even impossible task in many applications. Another well known method is to automatically discover the typical subseries by clustering all the subseries in a sliding window with fixed size [2]. Such method can symbolize time series in the unsupervised way. However, an implicit assumption that all the similar movements are with the same length is essential for the development of this kind of methods. Intuitively, this is not the case for most real-world applications where there are many movements in time series that are similar but with different lengths. Therefore, as we demonstrated, the methods that considering sliding windows with fixed size cannot symbolize time series accurately. Moveover, selection of the window size is a very difficult task, especially when little about it can be known apriori. Our experiments show that when the window size is not correctly set, the performance will reduce to the results of random selection.
 key idea of our approach is to adjust the window size dynamically according to the data. This strategy enables us to focus on each individual subseries with relatively  X  X ptimal X  length rather than a fixed one, whereupon similarity mea-surement that allows an elastic shifting of the time axis can be applied. The performance of our approach was evaluated on both synthetic and real data. The experimental results justified the superiority of our approach. A time series T = T (1) ,T (2) , ..., T ( N ) is a sequence of real values in which each value corresponds to a time point. T ( n ) stands for the value at n-th sampling time. The value might be of various dimensions. | T | = N denotes the length of T . T , symbolization is to convert T into a symbolic sequence S = S (1) ,S (2) , ..., S ( M ), where each S ( i )(1  X  i  X  M ) coming from a predefined alphabet  X  represents the movement (or content) of one subseries.
 the standard F 1 model as the measurement of it. Given the resulting symbolic sequence of symbolization S g and the  X  X rue X  symbolic sequence corresponding to the time series S t , the F 1 measure combines recall ( r )and precision ( p ) with an equal weight in the following form: F 1 ( r, p )=2 rp/ ( r + p ) where r is defined to be the ratio of the  X  X rue X  symbols in S g by the total number of symbols in S t , i.e. r =LCS( S g ,S t ) / | S t | ,and p is the ratio of the  X  X rue X  symbols in S g by the total number of symbols in S g , i.e. p =LCS( S g ,S t ) / | S g | . LCS is the longest common subsequence of the two sequences defined as follows: Given two sequences A and B, and a parameter  X  ,
LCS  X  ( A, B )= Our approach is to expand a subseries tentatively, and determine whether the current subseries should be classified into a category, or a new category contains it should be formed, according to the distances between it and each category. In order to accommodate the subseries that are similar but out of phase, we adopt dynamic time warping (DTW), which allows an elastic shifting of the time axis, as the measurement method. Given two subseries A and B , formally, D( A, B ) for A and B is defined as follows: are d c , d g , W min , W max ,  X  X  and  X  . d c and d g are the thresholds classifying subseries into the category and generating a new category respectively. W min and W max are used to restrict the length of subseries, and  X  X  is the sliding step of the subseries at each time.  X  is the alphabet containing symbols used to represent the subseries. The overall approach is illustrated in detail as follows and formally in Fig 1.
 T [ s, e ] with the length W min . Then our approach finds the nearest category C of number of the subseries belong to C, and p is a subseries). If d avg ( T [ s, e ] ,C )  X  d c then T [ s, e ] will be classified into C , and the symbol representing C will be appended to the symbolic sequence S which begins with empty one. When d avg ( T [ s, e ] ,C ) be formed, then a symbol from  X  will be appointed to C n , and similarly, this symbol will be appended to S . If any of the previous two conditions is satisfied, T [ s, e ] will be re-initialized. Otherwise, T [ s, e ] will be expanded  X  X  steps, i.e. T [ s, e ] is expanded to T [ s, e +  X  X  ]. When the time series is processed completely, the whole symbolic sequence S has been generated.
 pacts of baseline and scaling factor by going beyond the absolute value and em-phasizing the trend or shape. There are many normalization methods which have been proposed, e.g. normalize time series T to T ( i )=( T ( i )  X  min( T )) / (max( T )  X  min( T )) where min( T ) and max( T ) are the minimum and maximum of T . matic method to set the parameters by sketching: Manually appointing similar revise d c and d n respectively to remove the influence of randomization of selec-tions, e.g. ce 1and ce 2 could take values within the ranges [1,1.2] and [0.8,1]. W min and W max can be taken by estimating the range of the length of subseries in time series. Consider  X  X  , greater  X  X  will result in improvement in time per-formance, whereas decrease in accuracy of the algorithm. Generally it can be set, e.g. 1 to 5, based on the length of the time series and the accuracy required. each typical subseries cannot be known apriori. Then  X  is selected to be a group of simple identifiers without meaning, e.g.  X  X  X ... X  X  X , before symbolization. And then a post-processing procedure can convert the resulting symbolic sequence by rewriting each symbol to a more meaningful one provided by domain expert X  X  explanations on the resulting typical subseries. In this section we first compare the performance of our approach with the fixed-window method. The synthetic data set was used so that we could control the  X  X rue X  symbolic sequence. The data set was generated as follows: It totally con-sisted of 100 time series. Each time series was connected by 100 subseries. Each subseries was randomly selected from the three basic shapes including Sine, Co-sine and Straight line and then extended or contracted in the time axis and y-axis respectively. Finally Gaussian noise was added to the whole time series. in the fixed-window method. And for an exhaustive comparison, each time series was symbolized for 2125 times by the fixed-window method with the various parameters including window width from 6 to 30, clustering number from 2 to 6 and start position from 1 to w  X  1 where w is the window width and one time by our approach. So 100  X  (2125 + 1) = 212600 times symbolizations were done by us. The parameters in our approach were set using the method described in Sect. 3 as follows: d c =1 . 45; d n =5 . 5; W min =6; W max = 30;  X  X  =1 . F 1 measure proposed in Sect. 2 was used to evaluate the accuracy of the two methods.
 The  X  X rue X  symbolic sequence S t could be obtained during the process generating the synthetic time series. S g was generated as follows: For the typical subseries T [ s, e ] of each category C i generated, we found the nearest shape B j from the the all the appearances of the symbol representing C i in symbolic sequence S were replaced by the symbol of B j , otherwise replaced by  X $ X  which was not one of the symbols representing the three basic shapes.
 of the results of 100 time series described in Fig. 2 show that our approach can yield substantially greater accuracy than the fixed-window method. There were none of the results whose accuracies were greater than our approach. We also made the comparison with the best results of the fixed-window method. We got the result that the inferiorities of our approach comparing with the best results of the method existed only at only 33 in 100 time series. Furthermore, selection of the appropriate window size to obtain the best result is a very difficult task, e.g. in this experiment. We do not display the figure to save space.
 in real-world applications, we used stock price data series, which corresponded to the opening prices of the stocks from Nov. 25th in 2002 to Nov. 24th in 2003, as an instance to explain the effectiveness. Each time series consisted of 252 real numbers. Due to space limitation, we only show one group of results in Fig. 3. subseries corresponding to each symbol. Replacing each subseries partitioned with the typical subseries of the category which contained it, we could obtain a reconstructed time series shown in Fig. 3(b). The accuracy of our method can be empirically justified through the visual analysis of the similarity between the original series in Fig. 3(a) and the reconstructed version in Fig. 3(b). In this paper, we consider the accuracy issue of symbolization of time series. And then a novel approach is proposed, together with a semiautomatic method for setting the parameters used. The experimental results justified the superiority of our approach over the fixed-window method. Finally, stock price data was used to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in real-world applications. Our approach can be expanded in the following directions: multidimensional space, other similarity measurement, and incremental approach for streaming data. Though our approach decides the boundaries of subseries only locally, it is simple comparing with the difficulty in the global criterion, moveover, it can obtain the acceptable results demonstrated in our experiments. In the future we plan to explore a more effective method by considering the global criterion. The work was supported by the NSFC 60403021 and the 973 Program 2004CB-719400.
