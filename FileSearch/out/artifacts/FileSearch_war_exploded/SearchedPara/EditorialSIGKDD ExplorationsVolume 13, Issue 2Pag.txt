 Dear readers, In this issue of Explorations, we begin with a special section dedicated to the topic of Educational Data Mining , containing four interesting articles, invited, guest edited, and nicely introduced by Toon Calders and Mykola Pechenizkiy. Next, we have three contributed articles, starting with a summary of the Process Mining Manifesto which was recently released by the Task Foce on Process Mining . Nikita Spirin and Jiawei Han have contributed a very nice survey on Web Spam detection, and Arthur Munson provides the interesting results of his study on the importance of and time spent on different modeling steps. The last section is guest edited by Qiang Yang, the general chair of the 18th ACM SIGKDD conference, which will be held in Beijing, China. He invited 13 of the top Chinese leaders in KDD-related academic and industrial research areas to write about the history of KDD in China, their own work, and their views on KDD. Last but not least, Qiang Yang also invited Usama Fayyad and Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro, the co-founders and current and previous chairs of ACM SIGKDD.
 Although many readers might expect the December issue of this newsletter to contain the workshop reports of the last KDD conference, we have chosen to move these reports to the extended electronic version of this newsletter which has now been integrated in the brand new KDD.org website, and edited by our new associate editor, and SIGKDD X  X  Information Director Ankur Teredesai. To conclude, I wish to thank the authors and the guest editors for their contri-butions and I hope you will enjoy reading this issue.
 Happy reading, Bart Goethals Editor-in-Chief Antwerp, Belgium bart.goethals@ua.ac.be
