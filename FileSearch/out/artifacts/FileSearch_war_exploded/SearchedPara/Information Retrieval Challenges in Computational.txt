 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Algorithms, Experimentation computational advertising, sponsored search, display adver-tising
Web advertising supports a large swath of the Internet ecosystem. It brings revenue to countless publishers that rent space on their pages for advertising It also provides valuable traffic to numerous commercial Web sites and has fueled the development of Web search engines. In 2011, the worldwide spend on online advertising is estimated to be over $80 billions 1 . In its core, Web advertising follows the two major models of traditional advertising. Direct adver-tising aims to elicit a direct response from the user. Spon-sored search is an example of direct advertising where ads are shown alongside the Web search results and is today a major channel for traffic acquisition on the Web. In con-trast with direct advertising, brand advertising aims to give a favorable impression of a brand or a product. Brand adver-tising on the Web is usually done by graphical ads (display ads) placed on the publishers X  Web pages.

Computational advertising is a new scientific discipline that aims to formalize the problem of finding the best ad for a given user in a specific context. In traditional adver-tising, the number of venues is small, the cost per venue is high, and little or no personalization is possible (as for ex-ample in print magazines). In contrast, in online advertising there are billions of opportunities (page views), hundreds of millions of ads and it is possible to provide personalization with quantifiable results. This brings the advertising into the realm of the other  X  X omputational X  sciences.

The aim of this tutorial is to present the state of the art in the emerging area of computational advertising, and to expose the participants to the main research challenges in ema rketer.com this exciting field. The tutorial starts with a comprehen-sive background survey of the topic. Then we will focus on textual advertising as sponsored search and content match where we use the user context to retrieve relevant ads. It is essential to emphasize that in most cases the context of user actions is defined by a body of text (e.g. web page or user query), hence the ad matching problem lends itself to many IR methods. We will discuss to what extend can standard techniques be applied in this new setting and then examine the IR challenges specific to the textual advertising.
Today display advertising is created, sold and traded in a complex system of intermediaries with overlapping roles that mediate between the publishers and the advertisers. In the second part of the tutorial we will overview the display advertising eco system and describe the roles of the major type of intermediaries as ad networks, ad exchanges, demand side platforms and publisher platforms. We will then focus on targeting as one of the key activity in display advertising. We will discuss the challenges and techniques for user pro-file generation from historical activity and how to use those profiles in various predictive and analytical tasks in display advertising.

Throughout the tutorial we will point out open problems that might interest the CIKM community. As online adver-tising is part of everyday life for virtually all internet users, research in this area can have a significant impact on the society. Dr. Andrei Broder is a Yahoo!
