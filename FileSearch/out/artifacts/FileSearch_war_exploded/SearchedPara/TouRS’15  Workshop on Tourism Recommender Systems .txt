 Tourism has been one of the most prominents fields of application of recommender systems in the last ten years.This summary gives an overview of the latest advances in the area, which have been presented in the RecSys 2015 workshop on Tourism Recommender Systems.

Recommender systems; tourism; diversification; planning; personalization; group recommendation; ontologies The huge amount of information about tourism and leisure activities available on the Web has turned the action of preparing a trip into a very challenging task, ripe for the application of recommender systems. Travellers are very keen on using tools that may support their decision making processes when they are planning a travel, including the choice of destination, the selection of attractions to visit, the construction of a multi-day plan, the suggestion of appropriate accommodations and restaurants, etc. Complex problem s such as automated planning, semantic knowledge manageme nt, group recommendation or context-awareness are now been h eavily studied in this area [2]. The works reported at the RecSys-2015 workshop on Tourism Recommender Systems, briefly comme nted in the next section, current challenges. Tourism Recommender Systems (TRS) usually employ a combination of diverse types of recommendation techniques: content-based, knowledge-based, collaborative filtering, demographic, etc. However, the particular characteristics of this domain provoke the appearance of novel problems and the need of developing new techniques (whi ch, in turn, could be later adopted in other domains). In the following subsections we comment some of the most relevant areas of this work in this field and the proposals made in the TouRS workshop. Classical recommender systems try to filter the domain items that may be more relevant for a partic ular user, given her demographic data, her past ratings or purchasing history and her preferences. This approach can be very suitable to recommend specific items such as books, songs or films. Ho wever, travelling is an activity that is usually carried out in groups of people (couple, family, friends, colleagues); thus, it is n ecessary to take into account the tastes of all the travellers when providing recommendations [4]. Two works presented in the workshop addressed this issue. In the system TravelWithFriends , the first step is to build a recommendation list for each user and to merge them (using the average without misery strategy) to obtain a destinations shortlist. Afterwards, each group member rates these options and a Borda count is used to determine the best five destinations to be recommended. The second work dealing with group recommendation is the system CLG-REJA , which is an extension of the REJA restaurant recommender [8]. In this case the first step is also the construction of a list of recommendations for each group member, taking into account her ratings. In a second step, an automatic consensus-reaching process is applied [3]. This is an iterative process in which individual preferences are updated until a high degree of agreement between all the group members is reached. Planning the order in which recommended tourist activities have to be visited is a complex problem that has received a great deal of attention in the last years [10]. Kurata et al. have presented in the workshop CT-Planner5 , the latest version of the well-known CT-Planner [6]. The system engages with the user in a collaborative process to construct a route. The user keeps refining her constraints iteratively, until the system can build a satisfying plan. Genetic algorithms are employed in the planning procedure. The use of semantic domain knowledge in the recommendation process, usually represented in the form of an ontology, has heavily increased in recent years [ 11] as exemplified by three of the works presented in the workshop. Borr X s et al. propose to improve the diversity of the results provided by the SigTur recommender [9] using a semantic clustering procedure. The items to be recommended are clustered according to their semantic similarity and the recommendation procedure iteratively selects the best item from random cl usters. It is shown that this procedure increases the diversity of the results while keeping their accuracy and an acceptable computational cost. The system Troovel also contains an ontology with information about the different kinds of tourist activitie s. The degree of relationship of each item with respect to each category has been automatically computed from TripAdvisor ratings. The user profile, which is continuously updated through the analysis of the interaction of the user with the recommended items, stores a preference degree with respect to each category, which is used by a hybrid recommender system to provide the appropriate suggestions to the users. Semantic information can also be used to determine the items to be recommended in a personalized visit to a museum [1]. More concretely, Lo Bue et al. have pr esented in the workshop a mobile guide in which both the user profile and the domain items are represented with bags of DBpedia topic categories [7]. A shortest-path semantic distance is used to determine the museum objects that should be recommended to the user. S X nchez-Vilas et al. show in th eir contribution to the workshop a surprising result: the performance of recommenders systems based on k-Nearest Neighbours improves when user profiles which are quite different to the current user are considered. This result is explained in terms of the diversity prediction theorem [5], which says that a higher diversity of the items considered in the recommendation leads to a smaller global error. Tourism is a very exciting fiel d of application of recommender systems [2]. The TouRS workshop, held at the RecSys-2015 conference, has witnessed the presentation of both theoretical and practical works which have highlight ed some of the most relevant areas of current work in this field, including planning, group recommendation and the manageme nt of semantic knowledge.
