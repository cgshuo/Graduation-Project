 Spam, also kno wn as Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE), is the bane of email comm unication. Man y data mining researc hers have addressed the problem of detecting spam, generally by treating it as a static text classi cation prob-lem. True in vivo spam ltering has characteristics that mak e it a rich and challenging domain for data mining. In-deed, real-w orld datasets with these characteristics are typ-ically dicult to acquire and to share. This pap er demon-strates some of these characteristics and argues that re-searc hers should pursue in vivo spam ltering as an accessi-ble domain for investigating them.
 spam, text classi cation, challenge problems, class skew, im-balanced data, cost-sensitiv e learning, data streams, concept drift Spam, also kno wn as Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE) and Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE), is commonplace every-where in email comm unication 1 . Spam is a costly problem and man y exp erts agree it is only getting worse [7; 24; 31; 34; 14]. Because of the economics of spam and the diculties inheren t in stopping it, it is unlik ely to go away soon. Man y data mining and mac hine learning researc hers have work ed on spam detection and ltering, commonly treat-ing it as a basic text classi cation problem. The problem is popular enough that it has been the sub ject of a Data Mining Cup con test [10] as well as numerous class pro jects. Bayesian analysis has been very popular [28; 30; 16; 3], but researc hers have also used SVMs [20], decisions trees [4], memory and case-based reasoning [29; 8], rule learning [27] and even genetic programming [19].
 But researc hers who treat spam ltering as an isolated text classi cation task have only addressed a portion of the prob-lem. This pap er argues that real-w orld in vivo spam ltering is a rich and challenging problem for data mining. By \ in
The term \spam" is sometimes used loosely to mean any message broadcast to multiple senders (regardless of inten t) or any message that is undesired. Here we intend the nar-rower, stricter de nition: unsolicited commercial email sen t to an accoun t by a person unacquain ted with the recipien t. vivo " we mean the problem as it is truly faced in an op-erating environmen t, that is, by an on-line lter on a mail accoun t that receiv es realistic feeds of email over time, and serv es a human user. In this con text, spam ltering faces issues of skewed and changing class distributions; unequal and uncertain error costs; complex text patterns; a complex, disjunctiv e and drifting target concept; and challenges of intelligen t, adaptiv e adv ersaries. Man y real-w orld domains share these characteristics and would bene t indirectly by work on spam ltering.
 Impro ving spam ltering is a worth y goal in itself, but this pap er tak es the (admittedly sel sh) position that data min-ing researc hers should study the problem for the bene t of data mining. It is unclear whether spam ltering ef-forts could gen uinely bene t from data mining researc h. On the other hand, one of the persisten t diculties of researc h in man y real-w orld domains is that of acquiring and shar-ing datasets. Most companies, for example, do not release datasets con taining real customer transactions; we are aware of no public domain datasets con taining gen uine fraudu-lent transactions for studying fraud detection. Even sharing suc h data between partner companies usually requires for-mal non-disclosure agreemen ts. In other domains datasets may still have cop yrigh t or priv acy issues. Few datasets involving concept drift or changing class distributions are publicly available. Without suc h datasets, the abilit y to replicate results and compare algorithm performance is hin-dered and progress on these researc h topics will be impaired. Spam data are easily accessible and shareable, whic h mak es spam ltering a good domain testb ed for investigating man y of the same issues.
 The remainder of the pap er enumerates these researc h issues and describ es how they are manifested in in vivo spam lter-ing. The nal section of the pap er describ es how researc hers could begin exploring the domain. Lik e most text classi cation domains, spam presen ts the problem of a skewed class distribution, i.e. , the prop ortion of spam to legitimate email is unev en. There are no generally agreed upon class priors for this problem. Gomez Hidalgo [15] points out that the prop ortion of spam messages re-ported in researc h datasets varies considerably , from 16.6% to 88.2%. This may be simply because the prop ortion varies considerably from one individual to another. The amoun t of spam receiv ed dep ends on the email address, the degree

Figure 2: SpamCop: Spam forw arded and rep orts sen t of exp osure, the amoun t of time the address has been pub-lic and the upstream ltering. The amoun t of legitimate email receiv ed similarly varies greatly from one individual to another.
 Perhaps more imp ortan tly, spam varies over time as well. This was demonstrated dramatically in 2002 when a large num ber of open rela ys and open pro xies were brough t on-line in Asian coun tries, primarily Korea and China. Suc h a large new pool of unprotected mac hines pro vided great opp ortu-nities for spammers, and soon email serv ers throughout the world exp erienced a huge surge in the amoun t of spam they forw arded and receiv ed. The problem became so bad that for a brief time all email from certain Asian coun tries was blo cked completely by some ISPs [9].
 In spite of claims that spam is generally increasing [7; 24; 5], the volume varies considerably and non-monotonically on a daily or weekly scale. Calculating spam prop ortion even appro ximately is dicult. Although some public spam datasets are available (see App endix A), we are aware of no personal email datasets arranged over time, so it is dicult to matc h the two to establish priors. Nev ertheless, using p(spam) Figure 3: Drifting priors: weekly estimates of p (spam) tak en from data in gure 1. sev eral datasets we can mak e a case that spam priors change signi can tly over time.
 Figure 1a sho ws a graph of spam volume receiv ed in 2002 by Paul Wouters of Xtended Internet 2 . In 2002 the spam volume was 146 55 messages per week, indicating a great deal of variation in spite of its upward trend. For most people, the volume of the legitimate email receiv ed varies as well. Figure 1b sho ws a graph of the num ber of legitimate messages saved by the author over the weeks in 2002. The volume is 12 : 3 6 : 4 messages per week.
 Figure 2 sho ws the volume of rep orts issued from Spam-Cop's website 3 This graph also demonstrates some of spam's episo dic nature. SpamCop is a service used by man y peo-ple to lter spam and to submit rep orts (complain ts) to the originators of spam. Both the amoun t of spam submitted and the num ber of rep orts sen t sho w clear episo dic beha vior. These graphs sho w time variation in both the volume of http://spamarchive.xtdnet.n l/ http://www.spamcop.net/spam stats.sht ml p(spam) spam and the volume of legitimate email receiv ed, something that researc hers have not generally ackno wledged. Since the two sources of email|senders of spam and senders of legiti-mate email|are indep enden t parties with little in common, we can exp ect their variation to be statistically uncorrelated, and the class priors will vary over time. No xed prior will be correct.
 How much could we exp ect class priors to vary? If we assume that a user receiv ed the spam sho wn in gure 1a and the legitimate email sho wn in gure 1b, we can estimate the class prior p (spam) simply as the prop ortion of weekly messages that are spam. Figure 3 sho ws a graph of this value, whic h ranges between about .67 to .99.
 A further demonstration of changing priors app ears in Kris-tian Eide's study of bayesian spam lters [12]. In evaluating these lters he measured the volume of spam and legitimate email he receiv ed over the course of one mon th. These vol-umes are graphed in gure 4a, and the computed daily spam prior is graphed in gure 4b. The prior ranges from .32 to .9, sho wing greater variation than in gure 3, though the skew is not as high.
 Variation in class priors may be problematic for researc hers because it mak es solution sup eriorit y more dicult to es-tablish. A classi er that performs better than another on a dataset with 80% spam may perform worse on one with 40% spam [26].
 Should researc hers be concerned about these varying class priors? This question is dicult to answ er conclusiv ely be-cause it dep ends on classi er performance as well as error cost assumptions (discussed in section 2.2). But by emplo y-ing the cost curv e framew ork of Drummond and Holte [11], we can answ er a related question, How much of cost space is in uenc ed by this variation? This question can be answ ered by calculating the span of the Probabilit y Cost Function (PCF), whic h is the x axis of a cost curv e. The PCF ranges from zero to one and is a function of the class prev alence and the ratio of misclassi cation error costs. In the case of spam: If we assume that the cost of a false positiv e (that is, of classifying a legitimate message as spam) is about ten times that of a false negativ e, this reduces to Using the p (spam) range from gure 4b, the PCF range of interest for spam ltering is : 04 PCF spam : 47. Since the entire PCF range is [0,1], this means nearly half of cost space is in uenced by this variation in priors. Any classi er whose performance lies within this 44% could be a comp etitiv e solution. This is a wide range, and it is reasonable to exp ect classi er sup eriorit y to vary within it.
 The purp ose of this analysis is not to call into question the validit y of prior work, but to point out that changing class distributions are a realit y in this domain and their in uence on solutions should be tested. Con versely , researc hers in-vestigating skewed and varying class distributions would do well to study the spam ltering problem.
 Exactly how a researc her should best trac k and adjust class priors is an open question and will require researc h. Time series work in statistics should pro vide some strategies, for example, using an exp onen tially deca yed average of recen t priors. However estimation is done, researc hers should ac-kno wledge that priors change and static values are unrealis-tic. A further complication of in vivo ltering is the asymme-try in error costs. Judging a legitimate email to be spam (a false positiv e error) is usually far worse than judging a spam email to be legitimate (a false negativ e error). A false negativ e simply causes sligh t irritation, i.e. , the user sees an undesirable message. A false positiv e can be critical. If spam is deleted permanen tly from a mail serv er, a false positiv e can be very exp ensiv e since it means a (possibly imp ortan t) message has been discarded without a trace. If spam is moved to a low-priorit y mail folder for later human scanning, or if the address is only used to receiv e low priorit y email, false positiv es may be much more tolerable. In an essa y on dev eloping a bayesian spam lter, Paul Gra-ham [16] describ es the di eren t errors in an insigh tful com-men t: Ken Schneider, CTO of the mail ltering compan y Brigh t-Mail, mak es the same point more starkly [31]. He argues that ltering even a small amoun t of legitimate email de-feats the purp ose of ltering because it forces the user to start reviewing the spam folder for missed messages. Even a single missed imp ortan t message may cause a user to recon-sider the value of spam ltering. This argues for assigning a very high false positiv e error cost.
 Regardless of the exact values, these asymmetric error costs must be ackno wledged and tak en into accoun t by any ac-ceptable ltering solution. Judging a spam ltering system by accuracy (or, equiv alen tly, error rate) is unrealistic and misleading [26]. Some researc hers have measured precision and recall without questioning whether metrics for informa-tion retriev al are appropriate for a ltering task. Fortunately , most researc hers have ackno wledged these asym-metric costs, but metho ds of dealing with them have been ad hoc. The 2003 Data Mining Cup Comp etition [10] re-quired that learned classi ers have no more than a 1% false positiv e rate, but the organizers gave no justi cation for this cut-o . Graham [16] simply double-coun ted the tok ens of his legitimate email, essen tially considering the cost of a false positiv e to be twice that of a false negativ e. Sahami et al. [28] used a very high probabilit y threshold of : 999 for classifying a message as spam. Androutsop oulos et al. [2] performed more careful exp erimen ts across cost ratios of 1, 10 and 100, exploring two orders of magnitude of cost ratios. These approac hes suggest a deep er issue: true costs of l-tering errors may simply be unkno wn to the data mining researc her, or may be kno wn only appro ximately . Only the end user will kno w the consequences of ltering mistak es and be able to estimate error tradeo s. In vivo ltering requires exibilit y of solutions: the user should be able to specify the appro ximate costs (or relativ e sev erit y) of the errors and the run-time lter should accommo date. Admit-tedly this requiremen t complicates researc h evaluation since the sup eriorit y of an approac h may not extend throughout a cost range, and multiple exp erimen ts may have to be per-formed.
 Suc h uncertain ty is actually common in real-w orld domains, where exp erts may have dicult y stating the exact cost of an erroneous action, or the cost of the action may vary de-pending on external circumstances. This situation moti-vated dev elopmen t of a framew ork based on ROC analysis for evaluating and managing classi ers when error costs are uncertain [25]. In the case of spam ltering, the uncertain ty of error costs may not change temp orally but they do vary between users. Gomez Hidalgo [15] used this framew ork for dev eloping and evaluating spam ltering solutions, and found it useful. Drummond and Holte [11] have also dev el-oped a cost curv e framew ork that extends ROC analysis and serv es much the same purp ose. Whatev er technique is used for evaluating classi er performance, researc hers should be prepared to demonstrate a solution's performance over a range of costs. Section 2.1 made the case that the amoun t of spam drifts over time, so class distributions vary . It is also true that the content of spam changes over time, so class-conditioned feature probabilities will change as well.
 Some spam topics are perp etual, suc h as adv ertisemen ts for pornograph y sites, o ers for mortgage re-nancing, and moneymaking schemes. Other topics are burst y or occur in epidemics.
 One notorious example of a spam ploy coming into vogue is the \Nigerian Money" scam, a get-ric h-quic k scam in whic h help was solicited to transfer money from a Nigerian bank accoun t [32]. The details varied, but the sender usually claimed to be resp onsible for a large bank accoun t and re-quested assistance in \lib erating" the funds from the Nige-rian governmen t. The sender was willing to pay generously for access to a foreign bank accoun t into whic h the money would be transfered. This accoun t was usually drained of funds once access was gran ted. Eventually the people re-sponsible for the scam were arrested, and spam of that type declined quic kly (unfortunately , varian ts con tinue to circu-late as other people adopt the general idea). Prior to this scam, keyw ords suc h as nigeria and assistance were not strong predictors of spam.
 A more dramatic episo de occurred in April of 2003 when dec ks of playing cards depicting \Iraq's Most Wanted" were made available for sale. These cards were adv ertised pri-marily via spam. The adv ertising campaign created suc h a spam blizzard that its story|and the campaign's success | were written up in the New York Times [18]. This campaign abated quic kly and few of the terms uniquely asso ciated with this episo de retain much predictiv e power now.
 The point for researc hers is that spam con ten t changes over time so the \spam" concept should drift inevitably . Some comp onen ts (disjuncts) of the concept description should re-main constan t or change only slowly . Others will spik e dur-ing epidemics, as speci c scams or merc handising schemes come into vogue. Even perp etual topics do not exhibit con-stan t term frequencies.
 It is dicult to estimate how much we can exp ect \spam" as a concept to drift over time, in part because no metric of concept drift has been adopted by the comm unit y. It is beyond the scop e of this pap er to presen t a rigorous investi-gation of concept drift in spam, but a simple technique can demonstrate signi can t word frequency variation. Swan and Allan [33] emplo yed a 2 test to disco ver \burst y" topics in daily news stories. Their test was designed to deter-mine whether the app earance of a term on a given day was statistically signi can t. This test can be applied to weekly groups of spam messages in Wouters' archiv e. The results are sho wn in gure 5, with selected terms listed on the left side and a column for every week (1{52) of 2002 extending to the righ t. The heigh t of a bar at a term-w eek is pro-portional to the term's frequency in that week. The special sym bol \ " denotes a term burst: it app ears in a term's row if that term app eared more than four times in the week and the 2 test succeeded at p &lt; 0 : 01.
 Figure 5 sho ws that spam has complex time-v arying beha v-ior. Some terms recur intermitten tly, suc h as adult, click, free, hot and removed . Others are episo dic, e.g. , the terms common in a \Nigerian scam" burst in week 18 ( nigeria, la-gos, assistance, bene cia ry ) and terms in a \pornstar videos" burst in weeks 31{32 ( 0rgy , awesome, pornsta rs, jenna, lau-ren, nicki ). The term christmas bursts late in the year and presumably reapp ears every year around the same time. Spam beha vior is not simply a matter of one concept drift-ing to another in succession, but instead is a sup erimp o-sition of constan t, perio dic and episo dic phenomena. Re-searc hers in data mining have studied classi cation under concept drift but it remains an open problem. Work in the eld of Topic Detection and Tracking [1] is likely to be rel-evant to spam classi cation, though technically it addresses a di eren t problem. No detailed study of real-w orld con-cept drift has yet been undertak en, and to the best of our kno wledge there are no standard datasets for studying it. A longitudinal spam dataset would be an excellen t testb ed for investigating issues in concept drift and stream classi -cation. The spam stream changes over time as di eren t pro ducts or scams, mark eted by spam, come into vogue. There is a separate reason for concept drift: spammers are engaged in a perp etual \arms race" with email lters [7; 35]. Over time spammers have become increasingly sophisticated, both in their metho ds for sending out large volumes of email undetected and in their techniques for evading ltering [23]. In its early days, spam would have predictable sub ject lines like MAKE MONEY FAST! and Refinance your mortgage . Mes-sages would be addressed to Undisclosed recipients or nobody . As basic header ltering became common in e-mail clien ts, these obvious text mark ers were simple to lter upon so spam could be discarded easily . As message body scan-ning became common, fragmen ts suc h as viagra and click here could be chec ked for as well.
 To circum vent simple ltering, spammers began to emplo y con ten t obscuring techniques suc h as inserting spurious punc-tuation, using bogus HTML tags and adding HTML com-men ts in the middle of words. It is now common to see fragmen ts suc h as these: When rendered, these are recognizable to most people but they foil simple word and phrase ltering. To coun ter this, some lters remo ve embedded punctuation and bogus HTML tags before scanning, and consider them to be additional ev-idence that the message is spam.
 Spammers have also realized that lters use bayesian word analysis and con ten t hashing. In resp onse, they often pepp er their messages with common English words and nonsense words to foil these techniques [23]. Messages are designed so these words are discarded when the text is rendered, or are rendered unobtrusiv ely. Graham-Cumming [17] main tains an extensiv e catalog of the techniques used by spammers to confuse lters.
 Whatev er new ltering capabilities arise, it is just a matter of time before spammers nd ways to evade them. Already at least one compan y 4 pro vides a service for bulk commer-cial emailers to determine whether (and why) a prosp ectiv e email message will be ltered. In mac hine learning terms, spammers have a strong interest in making the \spam" and \legitimate" classes indistinguishable. Because the discrim-ination abilit y of spam lters impro ves con tinually , the re-sulting concept drifts.
 Because of this text distortion, in vivo spam ltering di-verges signi can tly from most text classi cation and infor-mation retriev al problems, where authors are not delib er-ately trying to obfuscate con ten t and defy indexing. Re-searc hers should exp ect that they will have to dev elop tech-niques unkno wn in these related elds. Muc h of the e ort of dev eloping spam lters will probably shift from feature com bining ( i.e. , exp erimen ting with di eren t induction al-gorithms) to feature gener ation ( i.e. , devising automatic fea-ture generation metho ds that can adapt to new distortion patterns).
 Suc h an arms race is not uncommon. Co-ev olving abilities app ear often when access to a desired resource is sim ulta-neously sough t and blo cked by intelligen t, adaptiv e parties. Fraud analysts observ e criminals dev eloping increasingly so-phisticated techniques in resp onse to securit y impro vemen ts [13]. With spam, the desired resource is the atten tion of email users, and spam may be seen as a way of illicitly gain-ing access to it. Another example of an arms race occurs in e-commerce. As pricing schemes have become more so-phisticated, consumers have become more adept at gaming www.assurancesys.com the systems. Sophisticated \shop bots" have been dev el-oped, and on-line merc han ts have had to dev elop ways to keep pricing information from them. Both sides con tinue to impro ve their techniques. Finally , the well-publicized con-ict between the music swapping net works and the Amer-ican music industry sho ws characteristics of an arms race, as both sides dev elop more sophisticated metho ds in their battle over access to cop yrigh ted material [21]. Suc h co-adaptation of intelligen t agen ts is foreign to most data mining researc hers: the data are mined and the results are deplo yed, but the data environmen t is not considered to be an activ e entity that will react in turn. With the inter-net, much information is freely and automatically available by all parties, and interactivit y is the rule. I prop ose that the future will bring more scenarios involving feedbac k and co-adaptation. Data miners may have to consider the e ects of mining on their task environmen t, and perhaps incorp o-rate suc h concerns into the data mining pro cess. Possible strategies include concealing one's deplo yed techniques from adv ersaries, incorp orating deception into techniques, or sim-ply speeding up the deplo ymen t cycle to adapt more quic kly to adv ersaries' moves. Spam ltering could be a useful do-main in whic h to explore suc h strategies. This pap er has made the case that in vivo spam ltering can be a complex data mining problem with dicult challenging characteristics: Researc hers wishing to explore these issues would do well to study in vivo spam ltering. Con trolled lab oratory datasets exhibiting these characteristics are often dicult to acquire and to share. Spam ltering, on the other hand, is an excel-lent domain for investigating these problems.
 Researc hers wishing to pursue this domain should begin col-lecting longitudinal data in a con trolled manner. Spam is notoriously easy to attract. Sev eral studies have measured the exten t to whic h various activities attract spam [22; 6], and this information may be useful. It is easy to create ad hoc email addresses (for example, through Hotmail or Yaho o) and to adv ertise them in a con trolled manner to attract spam. Suc h addresses are sometimes called \spam traps" and are used by email ltering companies suc h as Brigh tMail to obtain a con tinuous clean feed of spam for analysis.
 A more dicult problem is that of obtaining shareable cor-pora of non-spam email, whic h often con tain personal details that people want to keep priv ate. Tw o general approac hes have been tak en: 1. Researc hers who have con tributed personal email have 2. Androutsop oulos et al. [3] have suggested using mes-However researc hers decide to generate suc h corp ora, they should consider making their data publicly available. This article has outlined the challenges of in vivo spam lter-ing and explained how pursuing suc h challenges could help data mining. It is hop ed that this article stim ulates interest in the problem. The app endix and references should serv e as useful resources for researc hers wishing to pursue it. The opinions in this pap er are those of the author and do not necessarily re ect the policies or priorities of the Hewlett-Packard Corp oration.
