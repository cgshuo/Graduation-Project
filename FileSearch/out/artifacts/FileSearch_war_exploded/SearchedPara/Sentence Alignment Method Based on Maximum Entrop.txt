 History classics are the wisdom crystallization of the Chinese nation and the root of the modern culture. Translating history classics into English is one of direct and effective ancient corpus and language process method of ancient Chinese, directly translating historical books using the modern Chinese as bridge, which may achieve good results with the help of rich resources of mode rn Chinese. The extraction meth od of term trans-lation is based on parallel corpus between modern Chinese and ancient Chinese. There-between ancient and modern Chinese for term translation of historical classics, taking Shiji for example.

The sentence alignment methods can be classified into three types: statistical method, lexical method and th e combined method. The statistical method originally proposed by Brown[2] and Gale[3] is based on the fact: longer sentences in source language tend to be translated into longer sentences in target language, and shorter sen-tences tend to be translated into shorter sentences. The statistical method align sentence words (such as punctuations, mathematica l symbols, the named entity etc ), cognate in-formation or le xicon to align the sentences [4,5, 6]. The combined method employs both length and lexical information. For example, Wu [7] combined the sentence length with lexical information and achieved 92.1% accuracy on Chinese -English Hong Kong Han-sard corpus.

Although the research of sentence alignment has been conducted for a long period of time, the research of sentence alignment between ancient and modern Chinese is still in initial stage. At present, the log -linear model and statistical method are employed to align sentences in an cient and modern corpus in [8, 9]. In this paper, we employ maxi-mum entropy model based anchor sentences to align ancient and modern sentences in historical classics. According to the characteristics of history books, we select anchor sentences and impro ve Chinese co -occurrence characters characteristic function. [10, 11] , one type of sentenc e with the same phrases in begin or the end , the other type is 1 -1 mode sentence pair containing the same time phrases. The anchor sentences are employed to divide the paragraph into several sections. Then, the entropy of ancient and modern sentences is c alculated using maximum entropy model. At last, the sen-tences in each section are aligned by dynamic programming algorithm [12]. 2.1 Selection of anchor sentences The anchor sentences are implemented to control the alignment errors in a small range to prevent the spread of error. In theory, any kind of s entence pair can be come anchors. But for the consideration of simplicity in practice, we only consider 1 -1 mode se ntences Chinese as the anchor sentences. (1) Sentence pairs begin or end with the same phra ses
Through the observation of Shiji in ancient and modern Chinese, we find that some aligned sentences have same phrases at the beginning and the end of the sentence, while the non -aligned sentences do not have the characteristic. Obviously the sentences with the same phrases at the beginning and the end can be used as anchor sentences. Two points should be noted:  X  Ancient modal words does not make sense, so the modal words at the beginning and the end of ancient sentences are re -moved, including replaced by the modern Chinese characters. Some characters have the same meaning in both modern Chinese and ancient Chinese, the characters nee d to be replaced. For ex-( yue ) is replaced by  X   X   X  ( shuo ) . (2) Sentence pairs with the same time phrases
Shiji is a biographical history book, which records the history by biography. Each while the tim e phrases in ancient and modern Chinese are the same, sentence pairs with the same time phrases can be regarded as anchor sentences. In our training corpus, there are 341 pairs of sentences containing the same time phrases among 2798 pai rs, some of the number of ancient sentence character)
The sentence pairs aligned to each other usually have big  X  . There are little anchor than or equal to 0.6. So the pair of sentences with  X   X  0 . 6 can X  X  been regarded as an-chor. We find the anchor sentences with the same time phrases in following steps:  X  Calculate the sentence number rate  X  =  X   X   X  , i n which, N is the number of sen-paragraph.  X  Assum e the i -th ancient sentences contains time phrases with  X   X   X  ( nian ) , j -th modern sentence is the possible translation corresponds to the i -th ancient sentences. j =  X   X  i + k , sets [ 1, 0, 2] k  X   X   X  from experience.  X  Calculate the value of  X  for each sentence pairs and regard the maximal value as  X  Determine whether the sentence pair is 1 -1 alignment mode. Seeking all possible entropy with different alignment modes. If the entro py of optimal solution, then of different alignment modes needed to be calculated are shown in Table 2.
  X  Repeat above step  X  find anchor sentence s until the end of the paragraph . 2.2 Maximum Entropy Model can get good results. The maximum entropy model makes use of s entence length, align-ment mode, Chinese co -occurrence character . Sentence alignment process is to com-pute the entropy of ancient and modern sentences. And the formula is shown in Equa-tion (1) . ture function,  X   X  , H s t is the Chinese co -occurrence characters feature function. Chinese co -occurrence c haracter s . Through observation on corpus, we find that two sentences with more co -occurrence Chinese characters, the greater the chance of align-ment. In the real corpus, there are some the same Chinese characters in ancient sentence and the corresponding modern sentence, there are also the co -occurrence of Chinese used in the sentence alignment, it is in ancient sentence and the corresponding modern sentence far more than in the surrounding sentence pairs. In order to verify whether the Chinese co -occurrence characters can be used, we have selected 5 0 ancient sentences from manual alignmen t corpus to calculate similarity  X  , the results shown in Fig. 1.
In Fig. 1, line 1 denotes the similarity between ancient sentence and the sentence be -fore its corresponding modern Chinese translation, line 2 i s the similarity between an-cient sentence and its corresponding translation, lin e 3 denotes the similarity between ancient and the sentence after its corresponding translation. From Fig. 1 we can see the ligned ones . Wang [14] puts forward an algorithm to calculate the co -occurrence char-acter feature in the alignment between China and Japan, shown as formula (2). We tence. 
Formula (3) indicates the similarity between  X   X  and increased by the characters that appear in cates the similarity increased by the characters that appear in t . in modern sentence in both ancient sentence 
There are many nouns co -occur in both ancient and modern corpus, and most co -o ccurrence words appear at the beginning or at the end of the ancient sentence and its modern translation sentence. According to the different contribution to sentence align-ment, words at different positions are gave different weights. Formula (3) are impro ved as formula (6). sentence. () tence .

Sentence length . The alignment method employs sentence lengths based on the fact: longer sentences in source language tend to be translated into longer sentences in target language, and shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences [2]. In the certain random number of characters in another language. The character number is in -dependent identically distributed, complying with normal distribution.

The sentence length is denoted by the number of Chinese characters. In our experi-ment, tence. We fit the length ratio tences to normal distribution, fitting results is shown in Fig.2.

In Fig. 2, we fi nd the length ratio tion [15].

Sentence length feature is computed using the formula (7) [8]. different alignment mode s in T able 3 .
 alignment as m -n alignment mode. The alignment mode feat u re  X   X  , M s t is calculated using the formula ( 8 ) [9]. 3.1 Experiment settings modern Chinese translation of five basic annals from ShiJi, including Basic Annals of Qin , t he Basic Annals of the First Emperor of the Qin , t he Basic Annals of Hsiang Yu , t he Basic Annals of Emperor Kao -tsu and t he Basic Annals of Empress L X  as pairs are selected as test corpus.

The experimental results are evaluated by precision (P), recall ratio(R), and F meas-ure. R, P and F is defined as (9), (10) and (11) resp ectively.
In which, A is the number of sentence correct aligned, B is the number of sentence wrong aligned, C is the number of sentence not correct aligned .

In the experiment, we employ different combination of features to do sentence align-ters feature presented by Wang [14 ] , improved Chinese co -occurrence characters fea-ture pro posed by this paper is denoted by ICC. A denotes a nchor sentences feature . 3.2 Analysis Many factors affect the alignment results. According to the characteristics of the method, we analyze the results from the following three aspects.
 length mode CC I CC A P R F (1) Anchor sentences
The anchor sentences, which are the sentence pairs with the same phrase at the be-ginning and the end of the sentenc e s, have similar effects with the improved Chinese so t he accuracy of using anchor sentence is higher than using Chinese co -occurrence characters.

Sentences with time phrases describe events including person names, place names Chinese, and there are more co -occurrence Chinese characters . Therefore similarity can be identified as a measure to determine anchor sentences. 
One disadvantage of the anchor sentences i s the uneven distribution. Ther efore, the anchor sentences take effect obvious ly in some paragraphs, while do not work in other paragraphs. For example , the paragraph from  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  to  X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X n Basic Annals of Qin , has 35 time parses with  X   X   X ( nian ) , including 77 sentences. Clearly the role of anchor sentence in this paragraph will be very obvious. (2) Chinese c o -occurrence character
As shown in Table 4, when only a feature is used , the co -occurrence characters fea-tures obtain s the best result . The improved co -occurrence characters feature that gives different weights to co -occurrence characters in different position perform even better . When only using co -occurrence characters feature, the alignment is con d ucted accord-random , so the s imilarity in different sentences pairs may be the same or not very dif-sentence s with same characters at the begin ning or the end of the sentence as shown in T able 5 .
 (3) Length Feature
The length feature intends to match sentences whose length ratio is around 1.588, and it is easy to cause a mismatch for distribution on both ends of the peak. Due to the symmetry of normal distribution, the length feature cannot work well in both wings of the normal distribution, slightly different will cause the mismatch. In this paper, w e condu ct a preliminary study of sentence alignment in historical clas-sics, and achieve satisfactory results using the maximum entropy model based on the of Chinese characters , the application of th e method has many limitations. I n the future research , w e wi ll study a widely used alignment model not limited to ancient Chinese . Acknowledgements.
