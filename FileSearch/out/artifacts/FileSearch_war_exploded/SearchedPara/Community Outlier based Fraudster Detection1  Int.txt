 exists in all countries around the world. Fraud has been difficult to detect owing to its various forms.Among all kinds of subjects in healthcare, not surprisingly, the largest number of convicted fraudsters are physicians -the healthcare pro-fessionals who submit fraudulent bills. Healthcare fraud detection systems are intended to help to detect suspicious fraudsters and then rely on human experts to manually identify the suspicious physicians. Exsiting rule-based methods of-ten rely on rules designed by experts which can be used as a basis for identifying behaviors violating some of these rules [3],which are not applicable when it comes to the fraudsters detection problem. Nowadays, most fraudster dectection meth-ods are outlier based which aim to find the objects that different from most of the objects [7]. However, outlier based fraud detection approaches now available major in global outlier detection and can X  X  find local outliers accurately. tion at present. However, density-based, distribution-based and distance-based outlier detection method cannot detect local outlier objects as well as clustering-based outlier detection methods[3]. Meanwhile, it is difficult to cluster the physi-cians in the physician fraudster detection problem. Therefore, we model the heathcare claim as a physician-drug heterogeneous network and the physicians can be clustered by the structure of the network. Then these physician fraud-sters can be detected by combining community detection and community outlier detection in heterogeneous network. In this paper, we discuss the discovery of physician communities and pick out the community outliers who conduct anoma-lous business practices. Within such a community, each physicians specialty will match the kinds and quantity of the prescriptions they write under normal cir-cumstances. For instance, cardiologists will be divided into the same community with a high proportion of heart disease related medications whereas an oncol-ogist will tend to be in the same community compose of a high proportion of chemotherapy drugs. If a cardiologist is divided into the oncologist communi-ty, which is called community outlier, then the cardiologist is most likely to be a physician perpetrator.As shown in Figure 1, the circle and the square nodes refer to different drugs and physicians respectively. Physicians belonging to the same community should have higher similarity with each other. Otherwise, the physician which has low similarity with other physicians in the same community is most likely to be fraudulent.
 homogeneous network can be divided into disjoint community detection and overlapping community detection[6]. Figure 1(c) shows ordinary overlapping community detection in heterogeneous network, every node may belong to mul-tiple communities. However,this case requires that circle nodes can be divided into multiple communities, while the square nodes can be only belong to one community. In other words, this is a specific community detection problem in Heterogeneous Network X  X here is a constraint that each type of vertices have different demands for community detection.
 fraud detection methods are not applicable. Meanwhile, outlier based fraud de-tection approaches primarily aim to find global outliers and can X  X  find global outliers accurately. In brief, fraudster detection in healthcare cannot be solved properly with exsiting algorithm. Then we find that we can model the healthcare records with physician-drug heterogeneous network. We can cluster the physi-cians using community detection technique and conduct outlier deteciton in each community. In this paper, we develop HSLPA community detection algorith-m which extends SLPA into heterogeneous network and COBFDA-community outlier based fraud detection approach which has a higher recall and accuracy than traditional outlier detection based fraud detection methods. The extensive experiments on real-world healthcare claim dataset shows that our COBFDA outperforms the comparison approaches. fying the community structure of the network. Despite the ambiguity in the definition of community, community detection has attracted strong attention in recent years. A wide variety of techniques have been used for community detection-identifying the community structure of networks, such as removal of high-betweenness edges[14], statistical inference [15] and so on. However, most of them handle disjoint community detection which assumes that a network is com-posed of a flat set of disjoint communities. This makes sense for many networks, for example, most papers are published just in a single conference. In the back-ground of healthcare, drug/treatment can be used for multiple diseases are com-mon situations. Therefore, we need to adopt overlapping community detection methods, which means that each vertex may appear in more than one commu-nity. This is more realistic in most cases. For example, the same drug/treatment may be included in prescriptions by physicians in different departments. the clique percolation algorithm (CPM) [16]. CPM assumes that a community is composed of fully connected graphs and detects overlapping by seeking adjacent cliques. Nevertheless, networks dont consist of fully connected graphs in most situations.
 tection algorithms becomes more and more important. For the time to come, algorithms will be capable of handling networks with millions of vertices within a reasonable time. As a consequence, any practical algorithm must have a very low time complexity. One of the fastest community detection algorithm to date is the Label Propagation Algorithm proposed by Raghavan et al [10]. In LPA, each node holds only a single label and iteratively updates it to its neighborhood majority label. Despite its simple (no parameter) and near-linear time complex-ity (for sparse networks), it can only detect disjoint communities like most of other algorithms. SLPA is an extension of LPA for overlapping community de-tection [8]. However, our case requires that drug/treatment nodes can be divided into multiple communities, while the physician nodes can be only belong to one community. So we propose HSLPA algorithm which meet our demand that each type of nodes have different requirements for community detection. work: A network with multiple types of vertex and multiple types of edges is called a Heterogeneous Network. In a Heterogeneous Information Network, each node represents an entity (e.g., physicians in a healthcare network) and each edge (e.g., tie) indicates a relationship between entities. Each node/edge may have attributes, labels(indicates the community label of the node), and weights. Link may carry rich semantic information.
 objects, such that similarity between objects within the community is high-er than the similarity between objects in different communities. For example, a therapeutic area is a community in a healthcare insurance network. For heteroge-neous networks, one is often interested in identifying heterogeneous communities which contain objects of different types.
 nity outlier if its attribute is far different from other objects of the same type in the same community. For example, an oncologist physician is a community outlier if other physicians in the same community are all cardiologists. be specified as follows.
 ments), each prescription consist of a set of drug \ treatment.
 from other physicians in the same community. can be divided into three steps:(1) Constructing the heterogeneous network G composed of physician and drug/treatment.(2) Community detection in hetero-geneous network G through the proposed HSLPA method.(3) Community outlier based fraudster detection.
 4.1 network construct ,W and T represent the set of vertices, edges, weights of the graph and the type of the vertex, respectively. The vertices can be divided into two types: P for physician or DT for drug \ treatment. Vertex i of type P refers to a physician p i , vertex j of type DT means drug/treatment dt j .
 and drug/treatment dt j co-occurrence in the same prescription, dt i and dt j are used in chronological ascending order. The weight of edge e ( p i ,dt j ) between physician p i and drug/treatment dt j is defined as: Num ( p i ,dt j ) refers to the number of prescriptions consisting of drug/treatment dt j which were written by physician p i ; Num ( p i ) indicates the number of pre-cian p i uses drug/treatment dt j in his prescriptions. The larger the w ( p i dt j ) is ,the more often the physicians pi prescribes drug/treatment dt j . Weight of edge e ( dt i ,dt j ) between drug/treatment dt i and drug/treatment dt j is calculated as the correlation of drugs: erwise, it evaluates to 0. The 1[ distance ( dt i ,dt j ,pre n ) &lt; r ] = 1 indicates that drug/treatment dt i and dt j co-occurrence in prescription pre n and their distance is smaller than the defined threshold r(decided by expert experiment). dt i and dt j occurrence in pre n in chronological ascending order.The distance between dt i and dt j is calculated as follows. where loc ( dt j ,pre n ) and loc ( dt i ,pre n ) represent the corresponding locations of j and i in prescription pre n . For instance, pre 1 and pre 2 are two different pre-scriptions composed of drug/treatment used in chronological ascending order and a,b,c,d,e indicate different drug/treatment. For prescription pre 1 = ( a  X  b  X  c  X  d  X  e ) and pre 2 = ( b  X  a  X  d  X  f  X  g  X  c ): dt j are in prescription pre n .
 the closeness between drug/treatment dt i and dt j . The larger the w dt i dt j is, the more often drug/treatment dt i and dt j co-occurrence in the same prescription, the closer dt i and dt j is.
 tices and they are both in the range of [0,1]. So we can consider the network G as a heterogeneous network. To find the suspicious physicians, we need to conduct community detection in G and proceed community outlier detection in each community. 4.2 Community Detection lem. Existing clustering-based outlier detection methods are able to find local outliers. However, it is difficult to cluster the physicians because the demograph-ic features of the physicians are not able to cluster the physicians properly in the problem of fraudster detection. So we construct physician-drug network and decide to cluster the physicians by community detection methods in G. The physicians can be divided into communities by the structure of the network. (1) the network consists of both physicians and drug/treatment. Physician and drug/treatment are two types of entities. (2) the physician can only belong to one community while the drug/treatment can pertain to multiple communities. In the community detection of our healthcare heterogeneous network G, there is a specified constraint that different kinds of vertices have different demands for community detection. In other words, drug/treatment node can have more than one label and belong to multiple communities, which is called overlapping node. While physician node can only contain one label and pertain to one com-munity, which is called disjoint node. To do community detection in heteroge-neous network G, we propose heterogeneous speaker-listener based information propagation algorithm (HSLPA) which is an extension of speaker-listener based information propagation algorithm (SLPA) [8]. SLPA mimics human pairwise communication behavior. In each communication step, one node is a speaker (information provider), and the other is a listener (information consumer). How-ever, SLPA didnt consider this specific community detection in heterogeneous network.
 spread ones label to other nodes (2) how to process the label received from other These critical problems all point to the question that how information should be maintained. HSLPA follows the idea of mimicking human communication behavior as SLPA but applies different dynamics to adapt to the needs of the heterogeneous network.
 depending on whether a node serves as an information provider or information consumer. For overlapping nodes, a node can hold as many labels as it likes, which is up to what it has experienced during the propagation procedure driven by the underlying network structure. For disjoint node, a node can maintain the one label which has highest score. A node accumulates knowledge of repeatedly observed labels. Moreover, the more a node observes a label, the more likely it will spread this label to other nodes (mimicking peoples preference of spreading most frequently discussed opinions).
 tialized with this nodes id (i.e., with a unique label) 2) Secondly, the following steps are repeated until the stop criterion requirement is satisfied.a. One node is selected as a listener.b. Each neighbor of the selected node sends out labels following certain speaking rule, such as selecting the K label with highest prob-ability from its record.c. The listener accepts labels from the collection of labels received from neighbors following certain listening rule, such as selecting the most K popular label from what it observed in the current step.d. If the listener is an overlapping node, keep the labels received from the neighbors satisfying specified condition. If the listener is a disjoint node, keep the one label with the highest score while erasing all other labels.3) Finally, the post-processing based on the labels in the records of nodes is applied to output the communities. the label i to its neighbors according to its record with certain probability. t is the count of iteration. listening rule: The score of labels for the listener node u can be calculated by its neighbor speakers: probability that neighbor v transform label i to u. The higher Score  X  ( label i )( u ) is, the more possible the node u contain the label i. If node u is a disjoint node, it will accept the label with highest score; If node u is a overlapping node, it will accept the k labels with highest score(k is a predefined threshold according to domain knowledge).
 maximum number of iterations T is reached. In general, SLPA produces rela-tively stable outputs, independent of network size or structure, when T is greater than 20. Because of our strong applicable requirement for healthcare insurance domain, we set the stop criterion to that when the drug/treatment can be di-vided into communities which are corresponding to domain knowledge such as pharmacopeia.
 of the underlying network during the evolution. The community detection is performed when the stored label propagation information is post-processing. Convert the record of each node into a probability distribution of labels. For probability that node u contain the corresponding label. This probability dis-tribution defines the strength of association to communities to which the node belongs. The distribution can be used for fuzzy community detection [7]. Howev-er, for a given community, we would like to produce explicit answer if a node is a membership of this community. In other words, the answer should be binary, i.e., either a node is in this community or not. As a consequence, we perform a simple discretization procedure. Given a threshold  X   X  [0 , 1], if the probability of seeing a particular label during the whole process if less than r, this label is deleted from a node X  X  record. After this discretization, connected nodes having the same label are grouped together and form a community. If a node contains multiple labels, it belongs to more than one community which is called overlapping node. We remove the nested communities so that the final communities are maximal. Consequently, we obtain the community detection result C= c 1 ,c 2 ,...,c m , m is the number of detected community. 4.3 Community outlier based fraudster detection physician community outliers from the detected communities. The community outliers are physicians who have low feature similarity from other physicians in the same community.
 sent the selected features. Each physician can be denoted by a vector composed of these features. The features can be selected through statistical analysis of historical data. For a given feature f i , we compare the fraud distribution P(x) of the entire dataset and the fraud distribution Q(x) in the subset of fraud data with feature f i .The Kullback-Leibler divergence [17] between P(x) and Q(x) can be calculated as: If D KL ( P || Q ) of f i is greater than a predefined threshold  X  (which can be determined empirically based a given application), f i will be selected as a fea-ture.Divide the features into nominal type and quantitative type For nominal type features(i.e., department), when the value of this feature of two physicians is same, the distance is 0, otherwise, the distance is 1. For quantitative type features(i.e., average cost of prescription), the distance of this feature between two physicians is calculated as Euclidean Distance.

Distance ( f it ,f jt ) = For each detected community c, we calculate the dissimilarity between each physician pi and other physicians in the same community.
 p j denotes other physicians in community c except p i , f it is the feature ft of standard deviation of f t . For each physician p i , we can measure his possibility of fraud according to his similarity to the physicians who are in the same community with p i . To simply the calculation,we select the top-K largest similarity physician pairs and the outlier probability of p i is calculated as The log function is applied for the sake of normalization.The larger outlierScore( p i ) is, the more probability that p i is a community outlier in community c, the more likely that p i is a heathcare insurance fraudster.
 Then the physicians with highest outlierScore will be flagged as suspicious and sent to manual inspection. Domain experts will analysis the detailed healthcare claims related to these suspicious physicians and find out the fraud claims. dataset. The dataset used in this experiment is collected from the Healthcare Insurance Claim System which is currently used in reality. The dataset contains more than 10 million records of medical insurance claim activities from over 500 physicians. The performance of the COBFDA approach is compared against four state-of-the-art approaches. 5.1 Experimental settings is the largest local hospital. The database records are then preprocessed het-erogeneous network G, in which there are two types of nodes: physician and drug/treatment. The edges between nodes of different types indicate the rela-tion between physician and drug, while the edges between nodes of the same type show the closeness between drug/treatment and drug/treatment.
 Then in the community outlier process, 12 features are selected according to the Equation (5), such as department, average cost of prescription and so on. Divide the 12 features into nominal type and quantitative type.
 to evaluate how effectively each approach identifies fraudulent physicians. Pre-cision= tp tp + fp is the fraction of physicians identified as fraudulent which are indeed fraudulent. Recall = tp tp + fn is the fraction of all fraudulent physicians harmonic mean of precision and recall. Here, tp (true positive) is the number of physicians correctly classified as fraudulent, fp (false positive) is the number of physicians incorrectly classi?ed as fraudulent, and fn (false negative) is the number of physicians incorrectly classified as non-fraudulent. 5.2 Results and Analysis as Figure 3) according to the original healthcare claim records. Then we compare the result of our HSLPA and original SLPA in overlapping community deteciton of G. Our HSLPA can divide the network into communities which satisfy the rule that physician belong to only one community while drugs can pertain multiple communities. However, SLPA divide both physicians and drugs into multiple communities. HSLPA is more effective than SLPA in community detection in heterogeneous network.
 er detection approaches [3](distancebased,LOF,distributionbased and cluster-ing based) in terms of fraudsters detection precision. It can be observed that COBFDA, which combines community detection and community outlier detec-tion in heterogeneous network, achieves significantly better performance than other comparison approaches when number of claims exceeds 5,0000. es in terms of fraud recall. COBFDA outperforms comparison approaches signif-icantly across different N sizes. The recall values of the studied methods increase with increasing N sizes. COBFDA is able to correctly identify over 95% of the fraudsters from the datasets and has significantly higher recall than the other methods.
 combined together to form the f-measure (Figure 4(c)), COBFDA consistently beats the comparison approaches in the experiments. On average, COBFDA outperforms the comparison approaches in terms of f-measure by over 20%. tion approach -COBFDA -to detect physician fraudsters who commit healthcare insuance fraud. COBFDA is evaluated against four state-of-the-art approaches using a large-scale real-world dataset from Healthcare Insurance System. The dataset contains more than 10 million medical claim activity records from more than 500 physicians. Extensive experiments show that COBFDA is over 20% more effective than the existing approaches. Currently, COBFDA has been im-plemented as a recommendation agent to provide decisions support for approval officers in a medical insurance claim system to assess the probability of fraud for physicians. In subsequent research, we will focus on human-agent interaction techniques to help the COBFDA agent build trust with the users.
