 When large groups cooperate, issues of conflict and con-trol surface because of differences in perspective. Managing such diverse views is a persistent problem in cooperative group work. The Wikipedian community has responded with an evolving body of policies that provide shared princi-ples, processes, and strategies for collaboration. We employ a grounded approach to study a sample of active talk pages and examine how policies are employed as contributors work towards consensus. Although policies help build a stronger community, we find that ambiguities in policies give rise to power plays. This lens demonstrates that support for mass collaboration must take into account policy and power.

Wikipedia is a collaborative effort to develop a free on-line encyclopedia, in which all are invited to edit articles or create new ones. Wikipedia X  X  exponential growth re-flects its position as arguably the largest collaborative au-thoring project in the world. Contributors to Wikipedia participate with different perspectives and ideas about how collaboration should proceed [12]. As Wikipedia becomes a popular and legitimated reference (e.g. [7]), the contest between viewpoints is increasingly apparent on the article Copyright 2007 ACM 978-1-59593-845-9/07/0011 ... $ 5.00. pages. Kling [10] noted that social relations are multiva-lent, including conflict, coercion, competition, conviviality, combat, coordination, caution and control. A CS*W sys-tem that supports mass participation must accommodate behaviors spanning these multivalent social relations.
Wikipedia includes both technical and social mechanisms that provide a framework within which contributors work through Kling X  X  various c-words . Policy is the central mech-anism that Wikipedians have established to mediate and bound user activity, enabling the collaboration to move for-ward despite differences of opinion. These policies are dy-namic and evolving  X  participants invoke, debate, and create policy in much the same way as they do when editing and creating encyclopedic articles.

Our research focuses on how Wikipedia participants ap-ply and interpret policies on the talk pages that accompany each encyclopedia article. Through this lens, we find that consensus-seeking is the fundamental collaborative work that Wikipedians engage in and that policies are essential to that process. Unfortunately, some researchers unfamiliar with the CSCW literature still consider these critical as-pects of collaborative work  X  X ostly X  or, worse,  X  X nproduc-tive X  (c.f., [9]). Groupware systems should seek to support rather than eliminate work related to consensus-seeking.
A body of policies is not a silver bullet for negotiation amongst diverse perspectives. While Viegas et al.  X  X  argu-ment that hyperlinks to policies make it  X  X asy for modera-tors to point users to the precise rules they might be break-ing X  [19], we find more complex dynamics at play. Con-tributors may interpret a situation differently and draw on different policies to substantiate their views. A precise rule may not even exist. In this ambiguity, we find many ex-amples of complex power plays that contributors make to control content and coerce others during the consensus pro-cess. At the same time, the ambiguity of the consensus pro-cess and its shared language, the policy environment, draws the community together. This is essential for maintaining social cohesion as Wikipedia undergoes mass participation. Our research indicates that adding consensus and commu-nity to Kling X  X  list of c-words is important for informing the design of tools to support mass participation, in particular awareness tools and reputation systems.

We begin by describing relevant aspects of Wikipedia, fol-lowed by a review of related work. We then define a sampling technique used to focus our analysis. Next, the role of pol-icy is described with the help of several long vignettes from our sample that illustrate how policy use cuts across the  X  X -words. X  We conclude by discussing design implications.
Wikipedia pages are organized into subsets called names-paces . The principle encyclopedic articles of Wikipedia are in the main namespace. Associated with each article is a page dedicated to discussing the content; these talk pages exist in the talk namespace. A set of administrative pages belong to the wikipedia namespace, including pages that de-scribe policies and guidelines. The user and usertalk spaces contain personal pages of registered contributors. A more detailed overview can be found in [14].

When one views a page in Wikipedia they are looking at aparticular revision of that page. Each page has a revision history of every modification made to that page. This his-tory consists of the revision time-stamp, user name of the contributor who made the change, and a comment. The Wi-kipedia interface allows users to view the full history of any page. If a user finds certain edits unacceptable, they can revert the page to any earlier revision. When participants disagree, they will sometimes go back and forth reverting each other X  X  changes in an edit war .

Every Wikipedia user is considered a contributor .Con-tributors add content to Wikipedia either anonymously or though a registered account, but all contributions are logged. Anonymous users are logged by their IP address, while reg-istered users have unique user names. Among registered users, a smaller group of administrators is granted privileges to protect pages, delete pages, block troublesome users, ban selected IP addresses and take other administrative actions. A registered user can become an administrator after being nominated for adminship by other administrators who rec-ognize the significance of the user X  X  contributions and adher-ence to Wikipedian principles. A panel of administrators then reviews each nomination, examining the candidate X  X  contributions and hearing testimonials from the wider com-munity. There are currently just over 1000 administrators.
Talk pages do not look like traditional discussions in Use-net or in email. There is no threading mechanism. A dis-cussion often begins with a section heading and some text written by the first person to start a topic. Subsequent replies are entered below the heading, sometimes interlaced with prior posts and other times entered below all posts. Indentation is often used to indicate a reply, but this is not technically enforced. It is considered good etiquette to sign a reply with four tilde characters, which are automatically replaced with a time-stamp and the user X  X  login name or IP address.
We use the term policy environment to cover a hierarchy of policy types. At the top of the hierarchy are official poli-cies, which are applied frequently by participants and carry the weight of legitimate authority. These policies are the most clearly defined and have the fewest exceptions. Vio-lation of such a policy is grounds for user sanction such as being banned from the site. Next in the hierarchy are guide-lines . Guidelines are less official than policies, but violation of a guideline still carries consequences. Guidelines are more open to debate and likely to have exceptions.

The policy environment includes a semi-formal proposal process for developing new policies. Policies can start out as essays that express the opinion of a small number of contrib-utors. If there is enough support from the community, an Verifiability Sources need to be cited and reliable. Ownership Others can edit the content you write.
 Table 1: Example policies (top 4) and guidelines (bottom 2). essay can become a guideline and eventually a policy. Poli-cies and guidelines can also be declared by the Wikimedia Board of Trustees or Wikipedia co-founder Jimbo Wales.
Currently there are 42 official policies, 24 guidelines, and several hundred essays. Table 1 provides a few examples. We will not elaborate them here, but we will refer to and explain relevant policies in our analysis. We will use the term policy in the general case to mean policy, guideline or essay. When the distinction is important, we will use the more specific term.
 Policies serve a critical role in structuring collaboration on Wikipedia. At the most simple analytical level, the policy environment provides new users with a resource from which to learn editing and behavioral conventions [19]. When a new user violates a convention, an experienced user can refer to an existing policy, serving to socialize the user in accept-able practices and reduce the burden on experienced users. Appeals to policy also give contributors a shorthand method to validate actions taken in response to trolls.

Violators of policy are subject to formal sanctions. Aside from administrators X  ability to ban or block users for viola-tions, there is a dispute resolution process that Wikipedians are supposed to follow when conflicts escalate. The first step in the process is to make a  X  X equest for comment. X  This brings the conflict to the attention of the wider com-munity that can help diffuse the situation. If the conflict continues to escalate, participants can make a  X  X equest for arbitration. X  An arbitration hearing is a formal proceeding in which contributors are judged by an elected board of ar-bitrators based on their adherence to policies. If the case is accepted, the conflict is reviewed, a decision made, and policy violators are blocked, banned, or put on probation.
Policy can have a strong impact on behavior in mass par-ticipation. For example, Buriol et al. [4] performed a quan-titative analysis of reverts and discovered that reverts were cut in half in the months following the institution of the three-revert rule , which bounds the number of times con-tributors may revert each other X  X  changes in an edit war.
A contributor can reference Wikipedia policy in different ways. One common method is to create a hyperlink to the relevant policy page in the wikipedia namespace. The user can both name the link and point other users to the specific text of the policy. Such a link allows for a contributor unfa-miliar with the policy to easily learn about it. In this paper we use the typewriter font to indicate a policy link short-cut. In the example below, contributor U2 relies on policies to educate user U1 regarding the proper use of hyperlinks to external sites. We use the notation [U1] to indicate the user U1 X  X  signature.
In this example the respondent uses WP:SPAM to link di-rectly to a policy. The  X  X P X  indicates that the page is in the wikipedia namespace and  X  X PAM X  is a shorthand name for the policy. All policies can be referenced with this notation. The example also contains a traditionally named hyper-link Wikipedia X  X  external link policy , which links to a guideline describing criteria for determining appropriate web-sites to reference in an article.
Conflict  X  and how to handle it  X  is both a practical and theoretical concern for collaborative systems. Usenet bears a particular resemblance to Wikipedia. Both systems are home to a wide variety of topics. Wikipedia talk pages, like newsgroups, are populated by mini-communities that are a subset of the wider community. Both systems are open, in the sense that anyone may participate, but a cadre of  X  X egu-lars X  often dominate discussion. While both systems include heated discussion, Wikipedia presents the extra challenge of the shared production of an encyclopedia.
 Conflict in Usenet . However welcoming a community might be, a community must establish boundaries. One boundary mechanism for newsgroups is the scope of accept-able topics. Community leaders curtail discussion when they feel it has strayed, often through informal policies about ac-ceptable questions and topics. At the same time, it is pre-cisely these leaders who, because of their status, may push the boundaries of what is an acceptable topic [8].
Usenet X  X  tradition of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) often established principles for the community. Like policy use in Wikipedia, FAQs helped newcomers quickly learn the rules of the community, and gave members something to point to when conflict arose. Simply citing policies or FAQs, however, does not lead to smooth resolutions of all conflicts. Kollock and Smith [11] point out that although successful communities must have rules, the rules of Usenet are difficult to enforce. Our analysis of policy use in Wikipedia confirms this and extends the result.
 Conflict in Wikipedia In recent years, researchers have moved from Usenet to study conflict in Wikipedia. Using History Flow, Viegas et al. [18] examined the history of 70 articles and found that edit wars, a symptom of conflict, are quite prevalent and not limited to controversial topics. Moreover, they noted that these edit wars tend to be con-nected with increased activity on the discussion pages.
In a follow-up study, Viegas et al. found that talk pages play a key role in coordinating article creation [19]. They coded sections of 25 talk pages spanning a variety of sub-jects and popularity, and found that coordination requests and suggestions for changes were the most prevalent type of discussion on talk pages. They also found that references to policy were present in 8 percent of posts. Their analysis revealed that between mid-2003 and late-2005, the number of administrative pages grew at a rate nearly 8 times that of the main article pages, suggesting the growing prominence of policies. Although they did not focus on policy use, Vie-gas et al. conclude that  X  X here was never a [heated exchange] that could not be controlled by the community and its col-lective resolve in pointing contributors to official Wikipedia policy pages X  [19]. We use this as a point of departure: we have found numerous instances where fundamentally differ-ent interpretations of policy have led to a breakdown of con-sensus and policy references does not lead to resolution. We find that Wikipedians are engaged in complex power rela-tionships that do not necessarily reflect collective resolve.
Recent work by Kittur et al. [9] claims that the amount of  X  X irect X  work (work that leads to new article content) is decreasing and that Wikipedia is experiencing rising costs in coordination and conflict resolution. They base this claim on the finding that contributions to non-article namespaces are proportionally decreasing. They employ a machine learning classifier trained on controversially marked pages in Wikipe-dia (see 5.1) to find that the number of revisions to a talk page is the most predictive metric of a page being marked as controversial. While it is not the most significant indicator, the classifier identifies that the number of unique authors of an article is negatively correlated with controversially-tagged pages. They conclude that focusing community at-tention on controversial pages helps to resolve conflict. In retrospect, their classifier has actually identified Wikipedia X  X  existing formal mechanisms ( i.e. dispute resolution or even a review for feature article status), which results in more editors being asked to review and modify an article.
Kittur et al. also created a tool to analyze a page and identify a network representation of contributors. Links am-ong contributors represent reverts done to each other, in an attempt to identify conflict amongst contributors. They ac-knowledge that reverts are not the only indicator of conflict, but that it provides a useful proof of concept. Reflecting yet again on their claims, their network perspective is reflecting the  X  X n-group X  and  X  X ut-groups X  of a given article. That is, the visualization is potentially a lens into the set of in-dividuals who have, for the time being, claimed legitimate authority over the article and are able to enforce their own changes and those whose changes are likely to be rejected. However, Kittur et al. do not unpack the social practices reflected by their tool, apply their visualization analytically to further our understanding of how conflict unfolds, or de-scribe how their visualization may help the consensus pro-cess. Our work describes the practice of policy use and iden-tifies consensus-seeking as a rich domain for tool support.
Pentzold et al. [14] frame discursive practices in Wiki-pedia using Foucault X  X  discourse theory. In an analysis of four months of comment history for a single article, they find policy to be an important factor for rules of limitation , which  X  X elimit the sayable, define legitimate perspectives and fix the norms for the elaboration of concepts X  [p.65]. Our study provides a different lens. First, we examine talk pages  X  while conflict is evident in both the comment history and on talk pages [18], Bryant et al. found that Wikipedi-ans consider talk pages to be their primary means of com-munication [3]. Second, we employ a grounded approach to analyze a purposefully sampled set of talk pages across a range of articles. Third, our treatment of power differs significantly. Although we agree with Pentzold et al. about the connection between power and knowledge production, we approach the collaboration problem differently. Our ap-proach follows from Giddens X  criticism of Foucault  X  that his approach overemphasizes the power of the institution and neglects the actions of individuals that collectively and recursively generate such structures [6, pg 145-161]. In con-trast, we examine power plays  X  how groups of contributors claim legitimate control over content through the discourse of policy.
In this section, we describe how we purposefully sampled for active discussions and analyzed the articulation work [15, 16] from a Grounded Theory perspective [17]. We conducted our analysis with the November 2006 English language Wi-kipedia data dump. 1 All talk pages were parsed to mark each hyper-linked occurrence of a policy. This allows us to distinguish discussions with many references to policy from those in which policy use is less prevalent.
The first step of our sampling procedure was to focus our attention on pages with the most discussion ( tail sample ), and then hone in on the most active parts of those pages ( critical sections ). The discussions that we analyze are sam-pled from these critical sections.
 Tail sample . Nearly all measurable metrics within Wiki-pedia follow a power-law distribution [20, 2, 21], indicating that most editing activity can be captured on a few pages. Moreover, Viegas et al. observed that edit wars appear to be correlated with increased activity on the talk page [18]. We therefore reasoned that a tail sample of pages with 250 or more revisions to the talk page would provide a rich win-dow into conflict in Wikipedia. 2 This tail sample accounts for only 0.3% of all talk pages, yet it covers 28.4% of all talk page revisions. 3 More significantly, it captures 51.1% of all policy links made, indicating that policy use factors especially strongly in active discussions.
 Critical Sections . Talk pages in the tail sample often in-clude multiple years of discussion, dispute, and negotiation. To focus our study, we define a critical section of a page to be a time period in which there is a large number of revisions to both an article page and its associated talk page.
Consider the revision history H of some page (either an article or a talk page). In order to locate significant parts of
H , we group revisions by month. Because using the total number of revisions as the sole indicator of activity is prob-lematic (described below), we define a metric  X  to charac-terize the amount of activity during a given month. Let r be the number of revisions that took place in H during a month m ,and c be the number of unique contributors who made those revisions. 4 Then,
We use this metric for two reasons. First, exponential growth in the number of contributors results in many more revisions in the recent past. However, we do not want to
From http://download.wikimedia.org/
In the distribution of revisions per talk page, 250 is where the tail of the power law approximately begins.
Wikipedians often archive old discussions. We account for this practice by generating a  X  X onsolidated X  history for each talk page that includes all revisions in a page X  X  lifetime.
Anonymous contributions are not counted toward c . bias the metric against policy dynamics in the early part of a page X  X  history. We therefore use the number of revisions per unique contributor in a given month (the first term of the equation). Second, we want to capture months with a high volume of editing activity. Therefore, we scale  X  by the product of the number of revisions and unique contributors. A log factor is applied to this term to offset the exponential growth in the number of contributors.
 We then use  X  to define the months with high activity. Let M be the set of months since the page was created and  X  be the average of  X  over all m  X  M . The set of significant months M in a page X  X  history includes months m  X  M such that  X  ( m )  X  3 2  X  , or those months for which the activity is significantly above average.

We can now define the critical sections that we will sam-ple from. For a particular page, let M A and M T be the significant months for article and talk revisions respectively. The critical sections for the page are the sets of consecutive months where both article and talk page revisions are sig-nificant ( M A  X  M T ). Discussions we study are taken from the critical sections of pages in the tail sample.
The next part of our sampling procedure creates a classifi-cation scheme for critical sections that allows us to purpose-fully sample from different classes of discussions. We use two natural categories defined by the Wikipedian commu-nity and one that we define to distinguish sections that are exceptionally saturated with policy use. These categories were chosen to ensure that we examine policy use across possibly different forms of collaboration.
 Natural categories . Each critical section can be catego-rized with respect to two article-level classifications defined by the Wikipedian community: featured and controversial articles. Wikipedia regularly confers featured article status to articles that characterize exemplary encyclopedic stan-dards. This is regarded as the highest achievement for an article [3]. An article becomes controversial if a contributor inserts a particular template at the top of the talk page that marks the page as controversial. Although the use of this tagging mechanism is not always consistently applied, the majority of pages tagged as controversial are ones in which contributors are in dispute. A critical section is considered featured or controversial if it is part of an article that is clas-sified as such. We employ these natural categories in order to capture community-labeled successful collaborations and controversial pages.
 Policy-laden . We further distinguish critical sections whose discussions are highly saturated with policy links. For a crit-ical section c , we define a measure of the policy prevalence: where p is the number of explicit links to policy in c and the number of revisions to the talk page in c . The first term measures the density of policy (cited policies per revision) while the second term adjusts for the volume of policy use. The volume is adjusted by a log factor so that the density remains significant. We define a critical section as policy-laden if its policy factor is greater than or equal to twice the average policy-factor across all the critical sections.
Using our method, any critical section can be coded con-troversial , featured ,or policy-laden . The permutations of these codes comprise the sampling categories. Figure 1 shows the total number of critical sections in each sampling cate-gory. The two ovals in the figure represent the natural cat-egories of controversial and featured critical sections (1033 and 716 critical sections respectively). The dashed line th-rough the middle of the ovals separates policy-laden from the non-laden critical sections. We randomly selected nine critical sections from each sampling category, yielding 69 critical sections for analysis. 5
We approached qualitative analysis from a Grounded The-ory perspective [17], performing open coding and axial cod-ing to identify a range of behaviors and categories that char-acterize the space of policy-laden discussions as well as what is happening when policy is not explicitly being linked (non-laden discussions). We made special effort to sample and analyze areas where disconfirming evidence might be found ( e.g. not-featured and not-controversial).

What follows is a description of our findings based on a number of representative vignettes from the critical sections. We do not claim to have exhausted all possible analytic categories; however, we believe that our sampling strategy and analytic categories provide an interesting perspective on how collaborative systems and the policy environment help mediate and enable effective work. We first describe the interpretative role that policy plays and then analyze the power dynamics at work within the ambiguity of the pol-icy environment. We focus our analysis on the interactions between contributors who are not obviously trolls. Some of the discussion excerpts have been slightly reformatted to make them easier to follow. We have also anonymized text that might reveal the original article in order to protect the identities of the contributors.
Policy structures collaboration by providing a common language and strategies for action that contributors can draw on to interpret and apply to difficult or unanticipated situa-tions. For example, in the following excerpt, contributors to an article about a seasonal event discuss whether they can include a value calculated by one of them from a data-set published by the U.S. government. They conclude that they
Each critical section was between 10 and 100 pages of text. cannot because it would constitute an original synthesis of material, thus violating the no original research policy. Note how the contributors will even invoke policy without linking to it simply by writing the name or shorthand for the policy (e.g.,  X  X t would be OR, no? X ).

Interpretations of policy, however, are by no means consis-tently applied. In a different article, two contributors con-front a similar question of synthesis but accept a different interpretation. In this passage POV means  X  X oint of view X  which is often used in Wikipedia as a pejorative to suggest bias on the part of a contributor.

Decisions about whether a piece of text, link, or image should be included, reordered or rephrased are all grounds for heated discussion. Resolving these disputes through con-sensus is the most fundamental discursive work that Wikipedi-ans perform. Policies and guidelines support this work by providing a shared terminology for Wikipedians to use while debating their views with the (usually) shared purpose of creating a quality encyclopedia.

But policies are principles, not hard and fast rules  X  in many situations application of a relevant policy does not translate into an obvious action. Vignette 1 (next page) demonstrates the trouble that contributors have with con-flicting interpretations of policy, in particular with applying Wikipedia X  X  policy that articles should express ideas from a Neutral Point of View (NPOV). The discussion concerns a content page about a political blog (PB) that uses strong language to describe those with whom the blog has differ-ences. In this exchange we see how the contributors struggle to write  X  X eutrally X  about a polarizing topic.

Policies are used to appeal to authority in order to justify changes to an article or find fault with contributions. Such appeals are part of the consensus process in which intended and executed actions are debated. In Vignette 1, initial ex-changes concern the reliability of sources and the neutrality of the text. A second attempt to justify the removal of the anonymous user X  X  entries is made on the basis of it being original synthesis. The dispute next moves in a behavioral direction, with each side accusing the other of violating poli-cies regarding civility and reverting. The dispute even turns to the question of Wikipedia X  X  moral position in describing the PB. Notice that U8 X  X  and U9 X  X  policy links without ex-planation demonstrate failed attempts to invoke authority  X  policies are useful only to the extent that contributors are able to argue for their relevance and saliency as they work through their multivalent social relationships.
When an action is out of bounds, a policy invocation can make that clear. However, as we have illustrated, policy invocation can be inconsistent and lead to debate over in-terpretation. Even within the bounds of policy there will still be contention and conflict when contributors feel that they can influence the outcome. We refer to all such vies for power as power plays . A power play is an attempt by an individual or a group to claim legitimate control over an article. Vignette 1 can be interpreted as a series of power plays between the two sides. In this section, we explore some common forms of power play that we found throughout our sample. While our analysis focuses on talk pages, power plays are not necessarily confined to talk pages and are not always instigated through a policy invocation. A power play is frequently intertwined with changes to the article, which might include actions that violate policies ( e.g. making more than three reverts in a row). These actions, in turn, become the subject matter for reciprocal power plays. We found seven types of power plays to be the most prevalent: Article scope. Central and peripheral content is strictly delimited by an individual or core group of contributors. Prior consensus. Decisions made in the past are presented as absolute and uncontested.
 Power of interpretation. One sub-community commands greater authority than another.
 Legitimacy of contributor. Traits of a contributor ( e.g. ex-pertise) are used to bolster or undermine a position. Threat of sanction. Threatening to use sanctioning mech-anisms ( e.g. blocking) or to pursue formal arbitration. Practice on other pages. Content organization on other articles is used to validate or discredit contributions. Legitimacy of source. The cited source is discredited.
Due to space constraints, we provide detailed analysis of the first four power plays through representative vignettes. Our explanations will highlight these specific power plays.
An article X  X  scope is a prevalent focal point for power plays. In Vignette 2, a newcomer has proposed to include some sociopolitical aspects to an article on a frequently de-bated scientific topic. A core group of contributors defends their decision to restrict the article to scientific aspects of the topic, thus delimiting legitimate article content.
Policies are ambiguous on scoping issues. One of the relevant policies, Wikipedia is not paper , states that the main article on a topic should summarize the important sub-jects and provide links to sub-articles with more in-depth information. It is then up to the contributors to debate what is considered  X  X mportant. X  In Vignette 2, [U12] strives to demonstrate the importance of the sociopolitical topics (e.g. by citing the prominence of paleocentrism in the me-dia and the practice of Encyclopedia Britannica). [U12] even attempts to mobilize the be bold guideline to justify his stance against removing the content.

Such struggles over article scope take place even in a hyper-linked environment because the title of an article mat-ters. The  X  X aleocentrism X  art icle is more prestigious and also more likely to be encountered by a reader than an arti-cle entitled  X  X he social effect of paleocentrism. X  An anony-mous user articulates this tension in a discussion regarding another article where the same type of power play occurs:
Consensus seeking is perhaps the most critical work done on talk pages. By explicitly discouraging voting in favor of discussion, Wikipedians hope to raise the strength of reason over untenable quantitative voting mechanisms. However, the ambiguity of evaluating argumentative merit continu-ally challenges consensus-seekers. Determining which view has achieved consensus is difficult at best. Such tension is evident in one contributor X  X  statement:  X  X hanks for clari-fying your views on the article. Unfortunately most of the editors who work on this article do not share the same view (i hope i am speaking for most of the editors). X 
Reliance on consensus leads to a number of temporally-based power plays. The consensus policy explains that  X  X i-lence equals consent. X  Most changes are never questioned, but for popular subjects, this principle forces article authors to vigilantly monitor recent changes to maintain their con-tributions. Contributors clearly recognize such tension:
Consensus is never final, what constitutes consensus can change at any time; power plays often operate within this ambiguity. While new contributors struggle against entren-ched veterans, those same veterans struggle to maintain the integrity of their work. This dynamic reflects a broader struggle over the ownership o f an article. According to the Ownership policy, anyone should be able to make contribu-tions to an article. In practice, however, there are often de facto owners of pages or coalitions of contributors that deter-mine article content. Prior consensus within this group can be presented as incontestable, masking the power plays that may have gone into establishing a consensus. For example, in Vignette 2, the scientifically-inclined core group who has argued previously the place of sociopolitical aspects in the article present this consensus as absolute:  X  X e DID write an article just on the scientific theory of paleocentrism, before you showed up.... X  On the other hand, in the face of exist-ing consensus, a dissenting contributor or fringe group can simply wait for the opposition to leave the forum or grow tired of arguing against the same proposals.

Consider the following example where a contributor has just proposed a number of reasons for rewriting an article. In this excerpt from the debate, one of the core contribu-tors rails against the proposed changes, claiming that they rehash old arguments. A memb er of the fringe group advo-cating change chastises them for using prior consensus as a tool for excluding the voices of others.

At issue is the legitimacy of prior consensus. Longtime contributors do not want to waste time having arguments about issues that they consider to be solved. Pointing to prior consensus, just like linking to policies, provides a method for dealing with trollish behavior. On the other hand, new-comers or fringe contributors often feel that their perspec-tives were not represented in prior arguments and want to raise the issue again.
Wikipedia specifically declares itself to be an encyclope-dia first and an online community second. The policy What Wikipedia is Not elaborates that Wikipedia is neither a social networking site, a soapbox, nor a democracy, all of which point to how Wikipedia should be different from what are commonly understood as online or virtual communities. However, Wikipedia has definite traits of an online commu-nity  X  contributors share personal experiences, join Wikipro-ject groups that focus on particular themes, reference par-ticipation in other forums ( e.g. Vignette 1), and talk about joint, communal action ( e.g. Vignette 2). In fact, Wikipedia can be seen as a federation of porous communities that work on sometimes overlapping sets of articles.

These communities often hav e different goal s, understand-ings of proper encyclopedic content, and interpretations of legitimate policy use. Working through these differences strengthens the spirit of cooperation and understanding am-ong contributors. However, as Vignette 3 illustrates, ten-sion is also often present. In this excerpt, two Wikipedian administrators U23 and U27 delete material regarding per-sonal experiences of the medical condition  X  X rupism X  from the page, but do not post the reasons for the deletion to the talk page. Contributor U22, a  X  X rupist X , reacts to the deletion and initiates the discussion.

The page in question was primarily written by a tight-knit community of contributors, many of whom are  X  X rupistic. X  At the time of this excerpt, however, the page was in the pro-cess of becoming a featured article and had thus come under the scrutiny of outsiders to this community. The deletions by administrators represented a violation of what the core set of contributors had come to understand about their arti-cle. In their view, statements made by contributors with the condition were valid because they were in a legitimate posi-tion to explain how the condition affected their life. Sharing such experiences was integral to how the discussion of the article moved the editorial process forward. On the other hand, the outsiders who deleted content were administrators who had made many edits on other articles; they can be seen as core contributors to Wikipedia as a whole. The adminis-trators X  global conception of Wikipedia is markedly different from that of the daily contributors to the page. The admin-istrators X  conception of Wikipedia X  X  purpose, legitimated by fluent policy use, trumps the appeals to personal experience that U22 makes. Different Wikipedia communities have dif-ferent powers of interpretation .
Attempts to undermine or bolster the legitimacy of a con-tributor constitute another class of power play. This type of power play, like questioning the legitimacy of sources or threatening formal sanctions, often accompanies the power plays we have considered so far. The legitimacy of contribu-tor power play can either implicate an external attribute of a contributor ( e.g. race/ethnicity, expertise, or personal ex-perience) or their status within Wikipedia. For example, the demand by U22 in Vignette 3 that the experience of Frupis-tic people be represented is an example of a (failed) power play intended to bolster their viewpoint. Likewise, U13 X  X  dismissal of U12 X  X  usage of policy in Vignette 2 undermines U12 X  X  status as a valued Wikipedian. The following excerpt provides another example. In it, U24 draws upon his past contributions to argue against a contributor who is accusing U24 of being unproductive and disruptive:
U24 points to his revision count and the number of fea-tured articles (FAs) that he has contributed in order to le-gitimize his actions. This is a type of power play that a reputation system (e.g. [1]) will amplify.
Until now we have considered power plays that operate within the bounds of established policies and guidelines. One might see the example in Vignette 2 as borderline policy abuse by the scientifically-inclined community, but the pol-icy environment is not completely consistent and this creates room for debate. There are examples, however, where con-tributors consistently and successfully violate policy without sanction. Their power plays are often successful because their contributions to Wikipedia are highly valued.
Consider an excerpt from a philosophy article talk page in Vignette 4. U25 is new to Wikipedia, while U24 con-tributes heavily to this article and fervently defends against any changes that he does not initiate. In this case, U26, a longtime Wikipedian but infrequent contributor to this arti-cle, mediates between U25 X  X  first edits and U24 X  X  condescen-sion. U26 has proposed an alternate wording and Vignette 4 begins with U24 X  X  rejection of the change.

U24 makes several blatant  X  X s or them X  vies for power: if U25 X  X  actions persist, he will leave. By the end of the episode, U25 has acquiesced to U24 X  X  ownership, where-upon U24 acknowledges some of U25 X  X  suggested changes and commits to fixing them himself. Such actions clearly vi-olate policies against article ownership, civility toward other contributors, and treatment of newcomers. As a newcomer, U25 may not know of these policies, but U26 certainly does. The willing blindne ss stems from the fact that U24 is a val-ued contributor to philosophy articles and is not bashful about pointing this out. There is a scarcity of contributors with the commitment to consistently produce high-quality content; the Wikipedian community is willing to tolerate abuse and policy violations if valued work is being done.
Policies provide a common language for Wikipedians to in-terpret new and difficult circum stances and reach consensus amongst a myriad of viewpoints. The policy environment is also flexible and dynamic, changing as the community grows. Policy does not always solve content disputes  X  we have seen the many types of power plays that contributors make to control content. Such power plays, however, will be endemic to consensus-seeking within the vibrant cross-cutting communities that we have observed.
CSCW researchers have long understood that articulation work is critical for enabling collaboration [15, 16]. We claim that the Wikipedian community is strengthened by the dif-ficult work of seeking consensus and that such work is per-haps the most fundamental articulation work done within Wikipedia. Yet, some researchers still consider these as-pects of collaborative work  X  X ostly X  or even  X  X nproductive X  (c.f., [9]). In the early 1980 X  X , McGrath [13] challenged the common psychological notions of  X  X rocess loss X  in group tasks, pointing out that without social and interpersonal support, groups often disintegrate. Clearly, some elements of the coordination overhead can be mitigated. However, a mitigation technology must understand what function the overhead serves and be careful to support it. Simply elimi-nating the  X  X verhead X  can be devastating.
 Awareness tools . There is minimal technical support for consensus seeking. Mechanisms in Mediawiki such as revi-sion history, revision comments, and  X  X atch lists X   X  which alert contributors when selected pages are changed [3]  X  are a great start, and contributors have cleverly adapted their practice to the technological limitations. For example, some of the more articulate users link to a specific  X  X iff X  of a revision to highlight how consensus or conflict ensued.
More explicit awareness tools to summarize behavior could be created to help support the consensus process. In our analysis, we have seen many examples where contributors have difficulty tracking discussions and conflicts as they un-fold. This is true for participants engaged in the conflict as well as those who have come to help mediate conflict. For example, a massive amount of text is written and archived on talk pages. Sifting through all this text is  X  X oordina-tion overhead X  that could be safely mitigated. Wikipedians already struggle to annotate archives with descriptions of what discussions they contain. A system that annotates instances of prior consensus and who was involved in the process would be highly useful. These summarization tools would help to identify aspects of a conflict over time so that the state of an article could be properly understood.
We see such awareness tools more broadly than tradi-tional text summarization, incorporating, for instance, visu-alization tools. For example Viegas et al. pioneered History Flow [18] to visualize contribution trends to articles as run-ning striations, one for each user; it is useful for detecting edit wars. Kittur et al. [9] prototyped a visualization tool that clusters contributors based on their reverts, creating a view of coalitions that revert each others X  contributions. If such tools are to help improve awareness, however, their au-thors need to pay attention to how they might be designed for appropriation [5] by the Wikipedian community. Reputation System . The idea of a reputation system for Wikipedia has received much attention. A reputation sys-tem can incentivize meaningful contributions, but will also encourage competition. Therefore, a critical decision is to define what work is valued and operationalize it effectively.
Not surprisingly, the first reputation system for Wikipe-dia is purely content-driven [1], based on longevity of con-tributions to an article. A content-driven reputation system poses the danger of reinforcing a single dimension of legiti-mate action and may stifle the discussion that is essential to achieving consensus. For example, contributors may begin to chafe at compromising over changes because their reputa-tion may be adversely affected when their contributions are altered. This is certainly an important research direction, however, our analysis suggests that there is much articula-tion work that also needs to be incorporated.
We began our study by considering the critical role that policy plays in communities with mass participation. One important issue for CS*W systems that support mass partic-ipation is how to mediate conflict when it inevitably arises. Rich policy environments, like that of Wikipedia, serve to facilitate debates around what work is done, how the work is engaged, and individuals X  roles.

Though our grounded approach has focused on how the policy environment enables the consensus process, it can also be read in terms of the broader theme of articulation work [15, 16]. Specifically, our analysis begins to unpack three aspects of articulation work: process , content and mu-tual support . Power plays that relate to prior consensus ( e.g. 7.2) and how that consensus developed illustrate the work necessary to agree on a specific process or system of production. Power plays dealing with the article and the validity of specific sources of information ( e.g. 7.1) illustrate the work to decide what it is that the group is to create. Lastly, power plays about individual ownership ( e.g. 7.5) and legitimacy of individuals X  contributions ( e.g. 7.4) be-gin to illustrate the articulation work necessary to support individuals within the group. Linking the rich theory of articulation work to our grounded analysis is future work.
As we move from collaborative systems that support rel-atively small groups to systems that support mass partici-pation, we see a need to support the multivalent relation-ships present in our everyday interactions. In our study of Wikipediawehavefoundpolicytobeanimportantfocal point for facilitating collaboration. It provides a lens into the community that is particularly well suited for examining consensus, coercion, conflict and control. With our results we help frame the range of necessary considerations for de-signing more effective CS*W systems.
