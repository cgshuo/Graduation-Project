 Production and Manufacturing by Taberg Media Group AB Box 94, 562 02 Taberg Sweden Welcome back to Europe at ACL 2010! After three years, the ACL crowd is meeting again in Europe, this time at the very north, to escape from the Central European heat it experienced in 2007. This year, some significant changes can be found under the hood. The call for papers was formulated much more broadly than usual, and this idea brought up by the ACL membership and the Exec and then developed in detail by this year X  X  program chairs, Sandra Carberry and Stephen Clark, really caught on -the number of submissions has been the highest of all times, forcing us to put some activities, such as the SRW, as the fifth track on Tuesday morning. The number of reviewers is hard to compute exactly -but a glimpse into their lists in this year X  X  and previous years X  proceedings reveals that we almost certainly set a new record here, too (thank you all!). Also, the proceedings have switched to electronic-only for all events, and adaptation of the START conference automation software has begun towards a fully automated workflow from submission to the production of the final proceedings in pdf format. It has been made possible thanks to Philipp Koehn X  X  and Jing-Shin Chang X  X  willingness to serve as Publication Chairs two years in a row in order to ensure a smooth transition from the semi-manual process employed in the past. However, there was one thing that overshadowed it all: the enthusiastic, meticulously precise and absolutely professional yet in every situation very polite approach of the local arrangements committee headed by Joakim Nivre. His efforts have made my job, as the General Chair, a piece of cake, limited essentially to watching the tons of emails exchanged between the local and other committees and to answering emails like  X  X hy wasn X  X  I asked to be an invited speaker? X  (obviously, from people no one would consider for this honor anyway).
 Joakim has been helped by Be  X  ata Megyesi, Rolf Carlson, Mats Dahll  X  of, Marco Kuhlmann, Mattias Tsarfaty and by the Akademikonferens team affiliated to Uppsala University headed by Ulla Conti; from her team, I would like to thank specifically Maria Carlson, Maria B  X  ackstr  X  om and Johanna Thyselius Nilsson for taking care of the website.
 There are traditional ACL conference features as well -the workshops (with CoNLL-2010 as the big one), tutorials and the Student Research Workshop, the banquet (at the Uppsala Castle), the invited talks (albeit not-so-traditional this year, please come and see yourself), the Lifetime Achievement award, the business meeting and the closing session where the  X  X onference torch X  will be handed over to the Americas, as planned.
 The Workshop Chairs (Pushpak Bhattacharyya and David Weir) had a hard time deciding which workshops to turn down, and tutorials had to be kept to a reasonable number, too: quite an uneasy job for exhibitions handled by J  X  org Tiedemann. Publicity has been the responsibility of Koenraad de Smedt and Beata Megyesi, the local ararngements vice-chair. Students had again the opportunity to submit papers to the Student Research Workshop, organized by the SRW Chairs Nils Reiter, Seniz Demir, and Jan Raab, helped by their Faculty Advisor Tomek Strzalkowski, who also handled the application for the usual NSF grant supporting the SRW. Mark  X  eta Lopatkov  X  a, the other Faculty Advisor, then centrally handled the student travel grants. Mentoring was the responsibility of Bj  X  orn Gamb  X  ack and Diana McCarthy. Taking about money and the budget, the sponsoring committee has been quite successful this year by securing grants both locally and internationally: Mats Wir  X  en, Hercules Dalianis, Christy Doran, Srinivas Bangalore, Fr  X  ed  X  erique Segond, and Steven Pulman assembled and impressive lineup of sponsors. Thanks to them, all of you can benefit from low registration fees, subsidized banquet, the conference bag, and student scholarships and prizes.
 No thank-you would be complete without mentioning Priscilla Rasmussen -her experience, insight, and ability to predict the numbers and other things was extremely helpful, to say the least. The secretary-treasurer, Graeme Hirst, has helped to reassure us whenever there was doubt or an open budgetary question. And Steven Bird, who chaired the coordinating committee (a subcommittee of the ACL and EACL executive boards) which selected the conference venue and appointed the general chair and program chairs, has been with us throughout almost two years of preparations, helping to make sure we all (read and) follow the Conference organization handbook, and address all possible problems. Finally, a conference without your contributions (and you as participants, of course) would not happen at all. Thank you for working hard, for submitting solid work and for preparing interesting talks and posters! Enjoy the conference.
 Jan Haji  X  c ACL 2010 General Chair July 2010 Our goal this year has been to provide a broad conference program that acknowledges the very diverse field of computational linguistics and that recognizes the importance of both theoretical and empirical, data-driven research. In addition, we explicitly sought non-traditional conference papers such as surveys of important topics or emerging areas and papers that pose a challenge to the research community. A novel feature of the review process was the construction of different review forms for long and short papers and for the different types of papers, leading to a total of 20 different review forms. Not only were the review criteria for survey and challenge papers very different from the review criteria for research papers, but also the review criteria for theoretical research papers differed significantly from the review criteria for empirical research papers. Consequently, the program for the ACL 2010 conference includes a diverse set of papers, including papers in areas such as psycholinguistics and multimodal communication, as well as three survey papers and three challenge papers.
 Both the number of paper submissions and attendance at ACL conferences continues to grow. Once again, the number of paper submissions to ACL 2010 broke the record set by the preceding year X  X  conference. Discounting papers that were withdrawn or not reviewed due to failure to adhere to the specifications in the Call for Papers, there were 638 long paper submissions and 318 short paper submissions. Each submission was categorized according to topic and assigned to one of our paper tracks which were overseen by our 27 Area Chairs who selected expert reviewers to evaluate the submissions. Long paper submissions received at least three reviews and short paper submissions received at least two reviews. If there was a lack of consensus among the reviews for a paper, the reviewers then engaged in a discussion period in order to resolve disagreements. 25% of the long paper submissions and 22% of the short paper submissions were accepted for presentation at the conference. Unfortunately, even with adding a fifth parallel session, space prevented many very good papers from being accepted. As an experiment this year, authors were allowed to add an extra page of content to their final paper in order to enable them to address the comments and suggestions of their reviewers.
 The conference program consists of three kinds of presentations: long 25 minute oral presentations, short 10 minute oral talks along with a subsequent poster presentation, and solely poster presentations. While the conference proceedings differentiates papers according to whether they are long or short papers, there is no distinction in the proceedings with respect to the mode of presentation.
 We are delighted to have two invited speakers who will give what promise to be exciting plenary lectures. Andrei Broder (Vice-president, Yahoo! Research) will discuss the emerging field of computational advertising. Zenzi Griffin (Professor, University of Texas) will discuss language processing in interpersonal interactions. In addition, the recipient of the ACL Lifetime Achievement Award will present a plenary lecture on the second day of the conference.
 As is traditional, there will be an award for the best long paper, the best long paper by a student, and the best short paper. Reviewers were asked to indicate whether a paper might merit a best paper prize. Area chairs then reviewed suggested papers and nominated deserving papers for further consideration. Two Best Paper Prize Committees were formed, one for long papers and one for short papers; each committee consisted of 5-6 senior researchers. The committees, along with the Program Chairs, then selected the award recipients. The Best Long Paper Prize will be presented at the plenary final session of the conference on Wednesday afternoon, and the recipient will present his or her paper during this session. The prize for Best Long Paper by a Student and the prize for the Best Short Paper will be presented at the oral talks given by the recipients during one of the regular paper sessions. As usual, there are many individuals to thank for their contributions to the conference program. Most notably, we thank our 27 Area Chairs who did a superb job of overseeing the review of papers in their domain, the members of the Best Paper Committees, and the over 600 reviewers who in almost all cases provided detailed, comprehensive reviews. We also owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Rich Gerber; his START system made the review and scheduling process manageable. Moreover, his quick response to questions and requested modifications were very much appreciated. We want to thank Jason Eisner for his web site that provides invaluable advice on  X  X ow to Serve as a Program Chair of a Conference X . We were very fortunate to work with wonderful organizers: Jan Hajic as General Chair, Joakim Nivre as Local Arrangements Chair, Jing-Shin Chang and Philipp Koehn as Publications Co-Chairs, and the ACL 2010 Coordinating Committee. We also thank last year X  X  program chairs, Jian Su and Jan Wiebe, for their advice and responses to our questions.
 But the ACL conference is more than just the main technical presentations. We would like to acknowledge the efforts of Seniz Demir, Jan Raab, and Nils Reiter, along with the faculty advisers Marketa Lopatkova and Tomek Strzalkowski, for organizing the Student Research Workshop. We would also like to acknowledge the work of Lluis Marquez and Haifeng Wang for soliciting an excellent set of pre-conference tutorials, Pushpak Bhattacharyia and David Weir for compiling a set of very interesting post-conference workshops, Sandra Kubler for assembling informative system demonstrations, and J  X  org Tiedemann for handling exhibits.
 We hope that you enjoy the conference!
