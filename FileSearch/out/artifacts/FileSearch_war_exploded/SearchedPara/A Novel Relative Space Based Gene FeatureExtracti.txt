Gene expression profile is a typical high dimensional, huge redun-dant and noisy data. The research of cancer recognition using gene expression data is usually plagued with  X  X urse of dimensionality X  [3].

Dimension reduction is often used to solve the  X  X urse of dimensionality X  in cancer detection [4]. A method of dimension reduction is gene selection [5]. In Golub X  X  approach neighborhood analysis based on signal to noise ratio was used to Leukemia cancer dataset and 50 discri minant genes were selected [6]. In Veer X  X  approach, the genes were ranked by correlation against the disease outcome and 70 genes were identified [7]. Cho et al. systematically explored different gene selection methods including correlati on coefficient method, information gain and mutual information on different cancer datasets. Due to different proximity measures and optimization criterions it X  X  much different for selected genes [8]. Another method is feature transformation. Conde et al. presented a clustering based cancer classification and the average values of clusters were used for train-ing a perceptron [9]. Raychaudhur et al. summarized the observed variability in two hidden factors with principal components analysis(PCA) in the yeast sporulation dataset [10]. Feature transformation is able to discover the underly-ing informative factors for classification.

The main idea of cancer classification is that many valuable gene features are acquired via dimension reduction, then these features are applied to train the classification models. However by now all the classification models are con-structed on the same set of gene features without regarding of the locality of cancerogenic factor in biology. As Fig.1 shows there are two cancer patterns P and Q. The pattern P corresponds to the cancer samples in the x-y feature plane which are close to one another. The pattern Q corresponds to the cancer samples in the x-z feature plane which are also very close. Traditional cancer classifications with dimension reduction do not work for this case.
In this paper a novel relative space(RS) based gene feature extraction and cancer recognition is pro posed. Relative space to a cancer is obtained using feature transformation and a least spread space(LSS) with least energy to the cancer is extracted. It is proven that the cancer is able to be recognized in LSS. Then a sample is projected to the LSS of the corresponding cancer. Via projection the gene expression data is compressed efficiently and the noise and redundancy are removed effectively. Also cancer classification with least spread space(CCLSS) is presented to c lassify patient samples. The experimental results on Leukemia dataset and Colon dataset show CCLSS makes better precision than traditional classification algorithms.

If X is a square matrix ( m = n ) ,the trace of X is described with TR ( X ) ,and TR ( X )= n i =1 x ii 2.2 Gene Expression Data The gene expression data is usually represented by expression matrix. Let X be a gene expression matrix, where rows repr esent genes, columns represent various samples and cell x ij is the measured expression level of gene i in sample j . 3.1 Gene Feature Extr action with RS/LSS Assume in gene expression data there are k cancer classes and n samples. Let C i be the set of samples in i th cancer, and there are n i samples in C i ,so i n i = n . C i is the m space  X   X  for C i are produced as follow.
 gene in C i . Then the covariance matrix Cov ( C T i ) is decomposed as Equ.1. eigenvectors,  X  is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are  X  r (1  X  r  X  m ) and P =( p 1 , p 2 , ..., p m ).
 Definition 3. Given d  X  m as a rank to relative space(RS) , p 1 , p 2 , ..., p d con-is relative space matrix for C i .
 Definition 4. Assume  X   X  is RS with rank of d for C i ,and  X   X  is denoted to be ( s l 1 ,s l 2 ,...,s lm ) T .The feature extraction of s l is denoted as the projection the j th direction of  X  ,and s l  X  p j = m k =1 s lk p jk .
 After feature extraction, the informative data can be compressed efficiently when d m and the features is accompanied with following properties.
 Theorem 1. The variances of variables projected to p j (1  X  j  X  d ) in  X  equal to uncorrelated.
 Proof. Given i th cancer expression matrix C i =( s 1 , s 2 ,..., s n i ). The feature p unrelated.
 Theorem.1 demonstrates that the gene features extracted by above method are mutually uncorrelated and the noise and redundancy are eliminated efficiently. Also the smaller  X  j is, the less difference between the samples in C i after ex-traction is. The feature extraction owns following advantages: (1) local relative features for special cancer are extracted; (2) mutually uncorrelated between ex-tracted features and the noise and redundancy are eliminated; (3) in a cancer the samples are most similar and the cancer pattern is detected. 3.2 Cancer Classification with LSS(CCLSS) Assume a cancer dataset composed of k cancers and is divided into training set and test set. At first the LSS to either cancer C i in training set is obtained via above method. Then for each sample t in test set the RSD between t and either sample s in training set in the LSS of C i which s belongs to is computed and RSD s with the same cancer label of s are summarised as the weight for cancer identification. Finally t is identified as the cancer with least weight. The details of CCLSS is described as follows: Begin : End 3.3 Algorithm Analysis Definition 7. The class energy of C i in RS  X  is described with E ( C i , X  ) , E ( C i , X  )= 1 n The class energy describes the distan ce between mean and sample in a class. Themoresmaller E ( C i , X  ) is, the more similar and tighter between samples in C i is, or the more different and sparser is. So E ( C i , X  )isusedtoevaluate  X  . Theorem 2. Given d dimensional RS  X  i to the cancer set C i ,then E ( C i , X  i )= r =1  X  r ,where  X  r is direction spread coefficient.
 The trace d r =1  X  r is invariant under the transformation defined by the eigen-system P .If d = m it reaches the peak value which means the least similarity between samples in C i .Alsofrom Definition 4 in the d dimensional LLS  X   X  i the 4.1 Gene Expression Dataset and Preprocessing In this paper two gene expression datasets including Leukemia dataset [6] and Colon dataset [8] are used. In Leukemia dataset 25 of 72 samples are acute myeloid leukemia(AML) and 47 samples are acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL). Each sample contains 7129 genes. In Colon dataset 40 of 62 samples are tumor colon tissues(TCT) and the remaining are normal colon tissues(NCT). Each sample contains 2000 genes.

Information index to classification(IIC) [11] is used to filter genes is defined deviation of gene expressions within corresponding class. In Leukemia dataset the threshold to IIC is assigned to 0.8 and 196 genes are selected for following experiments. In Colon dataset the threshold is assigned to 0.65 and genes are reduced to 93. 4.2 Results and Analysis Firstly Leukemia dataset and Colon dataset are randomly divided into train-ing set and test set respectively and th e corresponding percentages are 70% and 30%. So in Leukemia dataset there are 51 training samples(18 AMLs, 33 ALLs) and 21 test samples(7 AMLs, 14 ALLs) and in Colon dataset there are 43 training samples(28 TCTs, 15 NCTs) and 19 test samples(12 TCTs, 7 NCTs). Then CCLSS is performed and the precision is calculated. The ranks of LSS for Leukemia are assigned to 1 , 2 ,..., 196 respectively and the ranks for Colon are 1 , 2 ,..., 93. The presented scheme is run 10 times for each rank and the average precisions are showed in Fig.2 and Fig.3. Fig.2 shows in Leukemia dataset the maximal precision is acquired when d = 20. Also the appropriate rank for Colon dataset is 18(Fig.3).

Then the locality of cancerogenic factor is discussed. In Leukemia the LSS s  X   X  AML and  X   X  ALL are built. The samples distribution is showed in Fig.4 and Fig.5. In Colon the LSS s X   X  TCT and  X   X  NCT are also constructed. The samples distribution is showed in Fig.6 and Fig.7. In Fig.4 and Fig.5 the dimensions of  X   X 
AML and  X   X  ALL are ranked by their corresponding spread coefficients ascend-ingly and denoted as dim1, dim2, ..., dim20 . In their subfigures Fig.4(a) and Fig.5(a) dim1  X  dim3 are selected. And dim5  X  dim7 , dim8  X  dim10 , dim11  X  dim13 , dim15  X  dim17 ,and dim18  X  dim20 are choosen for subfigures (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f). Fig.4 and Fig.5 show that in  X   X  AML AML samples are mutually close and ALL samples are distributed very sparsely while in  X   X  ALL ALL samples are distributed tightly and AML samples dispersively. So cancer patterns AML and ALL can be detected in  X   X  AML and  X   X  ALL respectively. Also in Fig.6 and Fig.7 the dimen-sions are denoted as dim1, dim2, ..., dim18 .Then dim1  X  dim3 , dim4  X  dim6 , dim7  X  dim9 , dim10  X  dim12 , dim13  X  dim15 and dim16  X  dim18 are used for sub-distinguish the TCT samples from NCT samples and in  X   X  NCT the NCT samples also can been picked out. So the locality of cancerogenic factor is illustrated by these four figures.

Finally Leave-one-out cross-validation(LOOCV) is used. We pick up the first sample of the dataset(Leukemia or Colon) as a test sample, and the remaining samples as training set. Repeating through the first sample to the last one, we can get an accuracy, the number of sa mples which are correctly predicted. The accuracies are shown in Table 1. Als o the accuracies acquired by other methods including Weighted Voting [6], the Clustering based perceptron model [9], SVM with RBF kernel and KNN (k=7) are presented. From Table 1, we can see that using LSS thegeneexpressiondatacanbecompressedefficiently. In Leukemia cancer dataset only 20 gen e features are extracted for CCLSS and the best accuracy is acquired while larger features are used in other traditional algorithms. And in Colon cancer dataset the 18 extracted gene features are applied to CCLSS instead of original data and the accuracy is also better than any other one. In this paper the cancerogenic factor X  X  l ocality to a cancer is explored in the gene expression data. It is proven that a cancer pattern is able to be recog-nized in the LLS . In the Leukemia and Colon dataset the LLS stoAML/ALL and to TCT/NCT are extracted respectively. Then the CCLSS based on LSS is tested using LOOCV and compared with other algorithms and the results show CCLSS makes better accuracy with sm aller gene features. Using LLS the gene expression data can be compressed efficiently and CCLSS is appropriate to cancer recognition.
