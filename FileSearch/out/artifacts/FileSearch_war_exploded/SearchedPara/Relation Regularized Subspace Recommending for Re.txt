 Recommending related scientific articles for a researcher is very important and useful in practice but also is full of challenges due to the latent complex seman tic relations among scientific literatures. To deal with these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework with link-missing da ta adaption, which casts the recommendation task to subspace embedding and similarity ranking problems. The relation regularized subspace in this framework is constructed via Relation Regularized Matrix Factorization (RRMF) for well modeling both content and link structure simultaneously. However, the link structure for an article is not always available in practical recommending. To solve this problem, we further pr opose two alternative approaches based on Latent Dirichlet A llocation (LDA) for link-missing articles recommendation as an ex tension of RRMF. Experiments on CiteSeer dataset demonstrate our method is more effective in comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches and is able to handle the link-missing case which the link-based methods never can fit.

With the springing of huge publications in real world, how to alleviate the overload of the overw helming scientific information and fully utilize this heritage of wisdom is an important and significant issue. In this paper, we focus on related scientific articles recommendation (RSAR), as a fundamental problem in various scientific  X  recommendation tasks. To solve this problem, a number of recommendation techni ques originally designed for Corresponding author commercial applications are introduced into the field of scientific recommending. However, some diffe rences in nature are obvious between RSAR and the most of commercial applications, which will be taken into our considerati on. Firstly, the users and items in RSAR are homogeneous, i.e., both ar e papers rather than people and goods (services). So, the attractive methods only based on rating information in commercial field are not fully competent. Secondly, the relationships among scientific literatures are more complex with higher quality than that among uses or items in commercial case. Thus, these va luable semantic relations abundant in scientific corpus must be taken into account.

To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework with link-missing data adaption for RSAR, which casts the recommendation task to subspace embedding and similarity ranking problems. In our proposed framework, both valuable contents and relations among scientific literatures are well modeled via Relation Regularized Matrix Factorization (RRMF) simultaneously with the capacity of dealing with link-missing data based on Latent Dirich let Allocation (LDA). More importantly, our contribution can be seen as the foundation of two other scientific recommendation tasks to some extent. In fact, measuring the relatedness of re levant papers in complex publication network is one unavoidabl e step to achieve their goals for personalized paper recommendation and citation recommendation. In the former task, e.g., using collaborative filtering, finding satisfying related pa pers is a vital step to search similar users with common interest for better predicting final recommendation. In the latter one, the key question can also be reduced to how to find the related papers with the most top-k similar ones for a given citation context. So, the proposed method can also be further adapted to two other recommendation tasks. 
For related work, the proposed method is different from the previous research omitted here due to the page constraint. Firstly, our method is a matrix factori zation based method. Secondly, no prerequisites for citation contex t or existing ontology terms are needed. Finally, we take the link-missing problem encountered in practical application into account, which, to our best knowledge, has never been discussed in the field of RSAR.
The proposed novel framework with link-missing data adaption for RSAR is presente d in this section. 
Many previous link-based met hods usually only consider one specific type of link information in scientific articles. In fact, there are at least three types of valuable relations among scientific articles, which can jointly provide diverse information of the properties reflected by the corpus. Taking advantage of RRMF, all three relational information can be directly modeled or tailored in a unique framework together. 1) Citation-Network 
A citation and its reference form the most obvious link structure that exists in research papers. The link is established by the author who builds direct semantic relation with references, which offers an information flow indicating knowledge evolution. So this type of link is crucial for finding the related papers, which can help people well understand the background or the evolution process. Moreover, it is also just the foundation for uncovering the other two latent structures, i.e., cocitation-network and coupling-network. The citation relation matrix is given by 2) Cocitation-Network 
Cocitation relation is originally analyzed in the field of scientometrics, which refers to th e relation existed in two research papers appearing in a common reference list. This type of relation is more interesting than that of the direct citation relation, due to its relation built by another person instead of the author of citing paper. It can help to find related papers from the third party view. In addition, this relation type in earlier work may be better uncovered than that in later papers since citation usually lags after its publication. Based on citation relation matrix in Eq. 1, we can obtain cocitation relation matrix, 3) Coupling-Network 
Bibliographic coupling or called coupling is another approach to evaluate relatedness between research papers in scientometrics. It assumes that if there is at least one common paper in the reference lists from two candidate papers, those two papers are defined as bibliographic coupling. Thus, this type of relationship gives the opportunity to exploit those papers without being cited. Moreover, since the newly publication is more inclined to be cited, it can also offer much more information about the research frontier regarding the target paper needing recommendation. Similar to Eq. 2, the coupling relation matrix is 
However, the problem in the linkage established in Section 2.1 is that all links adopt equal weights implicitly, because an author only gives a pure reference list without thorough citation motivations. So, the content of each paper must be taken into consideration as the complement of link structure. In the proposed framework, we employ Relation Re gularized Matrix Factorization to model both contents and semantic relations in scientific corpus. 
RRMF proposed by Li et. al. [1] in 2009 provides a unique framework for learning a subspace containing both relation and content information simultaneously. It is the extension of latent semantic indexing (LSI) and is or iginally used for classification problems in [1]. The objective of the optimization in RRMF is where  X  LD-A and D is a diagonal matrix with ii ij and To achieve the goal of incorporating relation information into LSI, the adding regularization () T tr ULU behind two former parts in Eq. 5 makes the latent representations of two scientific articles as close as possible if a relationship between them is existed. 
X represents the content matrix with row vectors expressing data elements. A is a relation matrix, in which non-zero elements denote the existing relationship between data i and data j , zero elements show no any relations. Thus, the relation modeled in Section 2.1 can be incorporated into A directly. 
For learning U and V with alternating projection method, one parameter is fixed and the other one is updated [1] in each round RRMF subspace is acquired, which contains both content and relation information as the row vector of U . Finally, we use Cosine similarity measure for our recommendation. 
In many practical occasions, however, the link-missing data problem in scientific corpus is inevitable. For example, to save computational costs, we usually use the snapshot of the whole citation network as the corpus for learning and recommending. In fact, there are many related papers out of this networked corpus. So, how to incorporate the outer ar ticles without any links into the linked corpus is a significant issue. To address this problem, this paper proposes two alternative methods, i.e., the multi-subspace ranking and link-missing data re gularized embedding in RRMF subspace via Latent Dirichlet A llocation (LDA) as a probabilistic generative model proposed by Blei et. al. [2] in 2003. More specifically, the whole corpus 12 {, , } M Ddd d  X   X  with 
M documents includes K topics and V words. The process of writing a document i d is modeled by LDA on the hypothesis that a person writing a document has certain topics in mind in advance. To generate each word n w of N words in document M d , firstly a topic n z is selected following the () m Multinomial word n w is picked from the selected topic distribution under (|, ) pw z  X  , which is a multinomial probability conditioned on the topic n z .  X  is a K V  X  matrix with the row vectors mixture component of topic k and  X  is a M K  X  matrix with the row vectors m  X  as the topic mixture proportion for document  X  and  X  are two hyper-parameters for  X  and  X  respectively. The probabilistic representation of whole corpus modeled by LDA can be obtained via Eq. 6, where dn z represents the topic of word dn w in document d . For estimating  X  and  X  in LDA, Gibbs sampling algorithm is employed in this paper. From th e view of matrix decomposition,  X  denotes the compact representati ons of original documents in 
K dimensional subspace. Based on LDA, we propose two alternative methods to deal with link-missing data on the assumption that the image u i of link-missing data has existed in RRMF subspace via Section 2.2 jointly modeling with linked data. 1) multi-subspace ranking (LDA-RRMF-S): For the link-missing data, we assume that if two documents belong to the same topic learned by LDA, they are more likely similar and related. According to this assumption, we propose the multi-subspace similarity measure, i.e., the similarity measure for the link-missing data i d is defined as the combined version of two subspace cosine similarity, 0&lt; 1  X   X  , So, the added topic similarity can be seen as the implicit linkage relation between the link-missing data and the linked-data. 2) link-missing data regularized embedding (Mix-R-Mapping): Following the above idea, this paper further proposes a regularized embedding approach for the link-missing data. In the proposed approach, we extend the assumption in 1) to subspace level inspired by the idea of MDS [3], i.e., if two data are similar in topic subspace they are also more likely similar in RRMF subspace. Thus, we manage to pr eserve this relationship between two subspaces for embedding the link-missing data. We define that this relationship is pres erved through its local neighborhood in two subspaces. Then, the embedded link-missing data in RRMF can be obtain via Eq. 8, 0&lt; 1  X   X  , where i n  X  is the n th nearest neighbor of i  X  in topic subspace, d with i n  X  in RRMF subspace and n w in Eq. 9, is the weight as the normalized similarity between in RRMF subspace via Cosine metr ic with the candidate papers. 
The experiments are conducted on the CiteSeer dataset 1 , which consists of 3312 scientific publications classified into one of six classes and 4732 citation links. Following previous work, we employ All-But-One technique as our offline evaluation method with the F1 and NDCG (optimal DCG takes the total relevant papers into account) measures. In fact, the evaluation task for the RSAR is nontrivial, because how to select the related paper for testing is a key question which ma y cause bias for other baseline methods. In this paper, we defi ne the related paper not only the papers with citation relation to the target but also with cocitation and coupling relations. Therefore, the task of finding related paper in this paper is more challenging since that if we test two cocitation-related papers we must disjoint the total papers which have the citation relations with the two papers and if we test two couping-related papers we must disjoint the whole common papers in the reference lists of two papers. So, the link is much sparser for the testing paper than that in the citation-related test scheme. In fact, we extend the task of finding only citation-related paper to all three relations in our evaluation. In this section, we compare the proposed method (RRMF-Subspace) with other six baseline approaches, i.e., Cocitation [4]; CCIDF [5]; HITS Vector-based [6]; Katz [7]; LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) [8]; Content-BOW (Content in original Bag of Words representation). In particular, we extract the papers whose number of relation count, i.e., the sum of row vector in A (including all three relations) is equal to or more than 20 times as our test data for recommendation. For evaluation, the each testing paper is randomly disjointed th e relation link including all three types according the predefined pr oportion, 10%. In this section, we only incorporate citation networ k without testing related links into RRMF-Subspace approach for equal comparison with other link-based methods, e.g., Cocita tion, CCIDF. The dimension of subspace is fixed to 250 for Section 3.1 and 3.2. HITS Vector-Based 0.0102 0.0197 0.0238 0.0287 RRMF-Subspace 0.1206 0.1516 0.1552 0.1511 Content-BOW 0. 1123 0.1200 0.1125 0.1080 Table 2. Seven Methods Comp arison on Citeseer for NDCG. HITS Vector-based 0.0237 0.0277 0.0300 0.0338 RRMF-Subspace 0.1457 0.1736 0.1938 0.2076 Content-BOW 0. 1507 0.1541 0.1571 0.1633 From Table 1 and Table 2, it can be found that RRMF-Subspace method performs best in all seven approaches. Due to our testing scheme discussed above , the citation network is sparse in testing context. In additi on, our objective of recommendation adds up to all three relations at the same time. So, Cocitation and CCIDF methods which are based on citation network show poor performance. For HITS Vector-based approach as a more general graph-based approach, computing authority values also largely depends on the directed graph with high quality. Thus, for our sparse citation network and comp lex relation finding task, HITS Vector-based approach is cornered by the acquired poor quality of citation context. In contrast, we can find the latter four methods are significantly better than the former three ones for their relatively looser restrictions. Specifically, Katz is a link-based method; LSI and Content-BOW are content-based methods; RRMF-Subspace is a link-content hy brid-based one. Therefore, it can be demonstrated that the propos ed approach is more effective and robust than other methods lis ted in Table 2 for RSAR task. 
In this section, several experiments to evaluate the further proposed methods in Section 2. 3 are conducted for link-missing data recommendation case. More pa rticularly, we randomly select 5% of total papers and then fully disjoin their all relations as the testing papers to seek all three missing relations built in Section 2.1. For this case that other li nk-based methods never can fit, RRMF-Subspace ( 0  X   X   X  X  ), LDA-Subspace ( 1  X   X  ), LSI and Content-BOW are the baseline methods compared with the proposed LDA-RRMF-S, Mix-R-Mapping and R-Mapping ( 1  X   X  in Section 2.3 with best values for F1 and NDCG respectively.

For average value comp arison of these three methods, Mix-R-Mapping wins the best pe rformance (0.1881) for F1 and R-Mapping acquires the best perfo rmance (0.3266) for NDCG. In contrast, other baseline approaches show relatively poor performance under both F1 and NDC G. Moreover, the detailed parameter sensitivity analysis for the proposed methods in Section 2.3 is presented in Fig. 1. to Fig. 4.. The smaller parameter the larger parameter  X  are more likely achieve relatively high performance in LDA-RRMF-S and Mix-R-Mapping respectively.

This paper proposes a novel framework via RRMF with link-missing data adaption for RSAR, which is more general than citation-context oriented model and is also suited for other related item recommending problems. More over, in our framework, we can incorporate any link-missing data into a linked corpus as long as we jointly construct RRMF subspace and then employ the proposed LDA-based adapting methods for the isolated data. Particularly, for link-missing data regularized embedding, multi-view information from RRMF Subspace, LDA Subspace and Bag of Word Space has been jointly well considered. Furthermore, how to further unify the subspace embedding adaption and matrix decomposition simultaneously is our future work.
