 1. Introduction
People exchange information and goods with one another in their daily life. Useful information becomes knowledge through face-to-face discussion. Document-recommendation based on locally stored files is proposed to aid users in effi-based technology, however, a large amount of information and knowledge has been transferred to online platforms, and the Internet provides an environment for people to contribute their knowledge and acquire the knowledge of others. One of the Internet X  X  intended purposes is to encourage knowledge sharing so that valuable knowledge embedded in the network can be effectively explored. Some previous studies on knowledge management show that the success of knowledge transfer to the expectation of Internet users in terms of acquiring and sharing valuable knowledge to meet their needs.
In knowledge-intensive online virtual communities such as technical discussion forums, knowledge sharing usually starts with knowledge inquiry in an online platform, which can take three forms: post-and-wait, know-what, and know-who or searchers, post questions in a forum and wait for answers from volunteers. The  X  X  X now-what X  X  approach describes most situations in which huge volumes of documents or knowledge repositories are stored in a database ready to be retrieved by keyword matching or other more sophisticated yet similar techniques. The requester can only obtain what is stored in the database, and may have difficulty in evaluating the quality of the information acquired. The third approach,  X  X  X now-who, X  X  is to construct the connections between searchers and knowledge providers. The main requirement of this model  X  is to possess knowledge as to who knows about the answer, and make it available to the searchers. The communities based kind of expert find-and-discover model which can help accomplish knowledge sharing through social interaction. countable posts, Japan is in the lead with over 2 million posts per day on their largest forum, 2channel. dred thousand smaller forums, the largest of which are Gaia Online, forums prevail among various organizations. On the IBM website, 200,000 replies. There are 28 online forums in the newly-established Microsoft research ceive tailored answers from peers after formulating problems in their own words, without using specific keywords to search  X  X  X ho is the right expert to ask? When can I get the answer? How do I reduce the request time? X  X  Without a practical means to ameliorate drawbacks and advance efficiency, the consequence is information-overload and time-wasting. A recommenda-tion mechanism based on the  X  X  X now-who X  X  model is therefore proposed in this study.

There is great potential in online forums in the area of knowledge sharing, but Steehouder (2002) also argued that there interested in discussing it, a question will remain unanswered. Second, questions may remain in the discussion group for a long time before being answered. Third, the ways to reduce the waiting time for a question to be answered are limited.
Considering these three disadvantages, this research proposes a social recommender system for more efficient knowledge sharing in online forum communities. In this study, we propose an innovative recommendation mechanism which identifies the online forum space, both for discussion threads and experts in the human-expert knowledge forum. Moreover, we utilize the concept of the Markov Chain model for social networks to find the most accessible and helpful experts if the user does not find satisfactory threads.

This proposed social recommender system provides the following advantages: First, the system can prevent the same question spamming the online forum. Second, the system can recommend potential experts to the requester if he/she cannot the aforementioned methods to find the relevant discussion threads. Nevertheless, if the search results do not meet the user X  X  needs, then the model recommends the most helpful experts and provides the shortest social path (including inter-mediate collaborators) for the requester. This model deals with the disadvantages of traditional online forum systems.
The mechanism actively recommends the most helpful experts with willingness to solve the given problem. Accordingly, questions cannot be ignored and they are resolved in a short time via the shortest social path.

The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related works, followed by the whole frame-experiments. Section 5 concludes and offers suggestions for further research. 2. Literature review 2.1. Online forum
An online forum is a Web application for holding discussions and posting user-generated content in a specific domain, interest groups for a particular topic may form from the discussions. Forums contain a huge amount of valuable user-gen-take advantage of the abundant knowledge available, researchers have started to construct expert networks and Question
Answering (QA) search systems in online forums ( Chen et al., 2006; Hu &amp; Elamy, 2007; Zhang, Wu, Wang, &amp; Huang, anism to support the knowledge sharing activities (thread filtering and expert finding) in online forum communities. 2.2. Question X  X nswering system
A growing number of search engines are widely used to meet the information needs of Internet users in order to solve the are called Community-based Question Answering (CQA) services, and those such as Yahoo! Answers, Baidu, and Naver have recently become very popular ( Chen et al., 2006 ). Recently, the QA system has been developed for knowledge sharing, and more systems are proposed by Cooke, ElSaadany, and Huang (2008) and Han, Song, Kim, and Rim (2007) . Researchers put study, we develop a recommendation mechanism for discussion threads and experts in the online forum environment. The first station of recommendation is a kind of QA system. By means of the proposed mechanism, the most relevant discussion threads are recommended in response to an input query which contains title and description expressed in natural languages. 2.3. Expert ranking mechanism
In expert finding, as performed in Text REtrieval Conference X  X  (TREC) enterprise track, a system has to come up with a uments related to the expert into one expert model. Experts are then ranked by measuring the content similarity of their researchers used graph-based ranking algorithms, such as PageRank and HITS, in addition to content analysis to rank human is that the size of their networks is very small and does not reflect the characteristics of realistic social networks. personal and informal communications. Such a socially constructionist view of knowledge exchange considers single indi-viduals as well as social aggregates and their structural patterns. It is also worth noting that some studies have applied in the expert-finding domain. A Markov Chain is a stochastic process and is generally used in describing path-dependent arguments, where current structural configurations condition future outcomes. The experiments show it has a better result than other graph-based models, so we have paid attention great deal of attention to it here. This study includes semantic to handle the expert finding in the online forum context. 2.4. Textual and semantic analysis
Previous works indicate that textual or semantic-based analysis in recommendation domains is suitable and fruitful the thread contents are strongly representative, we can discover the professional domain of human experts whom we want to recommend. Traditional information retrieval (IR) technology is applied to handle the semantic of thread content. By examining semantic similarity among threads and expert professional domains, the NLProcessor algorithm 9 help us parse and stem the crawled thread contents. Some research has applied the semantic-expansion method documents; therefore, in this study, we adopt an approach which modifies the traditional tf idf proposed by Horng, Chen, and Lee (2003) , which will be more suitable for weight calculations. 2.5. Role and expertise analysis In previous research, role-base mechanisms are usually applied in the access control domain ( Ferraiolo, Sandhu, Gavrila, plifying the management of the many-to-many relationships between users and permissions. Permissions are associated ing and solution recommendation issues, we transform the essence of the traditional role-based analysis. We define each permissions as the weighting of the experts. Moreover, we apply Z -score measures to calculate the expertise level ( Yang number of questions one user asked and answered. 2.6. Social relation analysis
A fast-growing number of expert-finding studies have shown that the social factor can help researchers in understanding 2005 ). Hence, many approaches have been introduced to tackle this problem by adding implicit links between blog entries.
We also apply similar measures as used in blogs to the forums, such as counting the number of common tags and replying that the Web is a bow tie and has four distinct components: Core, In, Out, and Tendrils/Tube. Yang and Chen (2008) explain (SCC) means that one can reach each user from every other one by following questioner (requester) X  X nswerer (expert) links. line forum network. 3. The system framework
In this study, we propose a social recommender system which employs semantic analysis, expertise analysis, and relation analysis modules, as well as a modified Markov Chain model based on social networks to construct a more comprehensive and personalized framework for relevant discussion thread recommendation and expert-finding in the knowledge forum.
Fig. 1 depicts the architecture of the proposed recommendation mechanism. There are four analysis modules developed to analyze the information from the constructed form network. The objectives of the analysis modules included in the sys-tem are described as follows: (1) The semantic analysis module establishes the term vectors for each discussion thread and user profiles to compute the (2) The expertise analysis module combines the interests and professions extracted from user profiles with the articles (3) The relation analysis module analyzes the degree of social similarity between users and the degree of popularity of a (4) The social network-based Markov Chain (SNMC) analysis module computes the transition probability (TP) that a
For each question (query) asked by the users in the forum, the system outputs a list of recommended threads and a list of recommended experts. The recommendation of threads is determined based on the semantic similarity ( SS the transition probability (TP) of an expert to the requester. The whole processes of the recommendation mechanism are detailed in the following subsections. 3.1. Forum network construction
To construct the forum network, we first choose a starting-point at random from users and from friend lists and groups, so ber relationships in the forum network. The network keeps expanding until the maximum degree of connections (links) is reached. Besides the friendship and membership connections, we also take the post-reply relationship connection into con-was clawed for further analysis.

The constructed forum network is then expressed by utilizing the concept of the agent and object described in a graph-nodes and document-like icons, respectively. Note that an agent represents a user in the forum network and an object is regarded as a post or a reply. Denote A ={ a i ,0&lt; i 6 tion, Agent-to-Object relation, and Object-to-Object relation. 3.1.1. Agent-to-Agent relation (A X  X  relation)
There are two kinds of social links between two agents. The first one reflects the explicit (one-or two-way) linkage be-between a requester and an expert, and the TP score, which is used to evaluate the degree of possibility (willingness) for an expert to help a requester, are A  X  A relation measures.
 3.1.2. Agent-to-Object relation (A X  X  relation) to satisfactorily answer a query, are A  X  O relation measures. 3.1.3. Object-to-Object relation (O X  X  relation)
In a forum network, O X  X  relation is used to evaluate the degree of similarity between objects. Many previous researchers have considered similarity as an important perspective in the recommendation domain ( Golbeck, 2006; Hu &amp; Elamy, 2007; query is an O X  X  relation measure. 3.2. Semantic analysis module
The main purpose of semantic similarity analysis is to indentify the most similar threads and to discover potentially sat-isfactory solutions and experts for the requesters. While the search function in the knowledge forum provides similar ser-approach to generate a set of representative terms to construct a term vector for queries, the discussion threads, and the professional domains of each user.

To evaluate the semantic similarity of discussion threads and user X  X  professional domains to a query, we apply a classic information retrieval (IR) technique (vector space model) to extract meaningful concepts and transform unstructured texts to structured data from the constructed human-expert forum network. IR techniques allow the documents and queries to be for two types of data source. One is the discussion thread term vector professional domain term vector ~ e k ; 8 k for all the posts (post/reply) and the personal file of expert e
The steps for forming the term vectors are shown in Fig. 3 . Once the forum data are crawled and HTML tags are removed, malization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic chunking, which are necessary steps in building many kinds of text handling applications. Moreover, NLProcessor outputs linguistic information by directly marking text with XML tags so that we can easily transform to the next step: stop word removal. For the process of removing stop words, we extract several syntactical functions (nouns and several kinds of verbs) that help us to extract useful terms. Next, fession domains.

The freq i,j is the frequency with which index term k i appears in discussion thread d times the most frequent index term, k l , appears in discussion thread d ber of discussions which contain index term k i . In addition to fitting the forum network, two parameters u and of occurrence in a discussion thread. The second parameter importance of a term in a discussion thread; count ( reply the count ( reply i,j ) presents the number of replies which contain the term k only includes title and thread description, we refine its tf idf by removing parameter
To compute the textual relatedness between a query and a thread, or between a query and a user X  X  professional domains, we apply the basic cosine similarity measure formulated as: are n human-experts and N discussion threads in the forum network. The semantic similarity between a query and threads,
SS , is defined as below: where ~ q r stands for index term vector of the query initiated by requester r and j .

The semantic similarity between a query and professional domains of an expert, SS where ~ q r stands for index term vector of the query initiated by requester r and ~ e domains of an expert e k . 3.3. Expertise analysis module fession of an expert. Role analysis is further used to evaluate an expert X  X  knowledge status in the forum network. In this standard deviations are above or below the expected random value a user lies. We formulate the knowledge status of a typ-ical expert e k as: where a k is the number of answers posted and q k is the number of queries requested by expert e semantic similarity between a query and the professional domains of an expert ( SS spect to a query q r is defined as: 3.4. Relation analysis module
The social intimacy and popularity (SIP) measure is derived from Li and Chen (2009) . In this study, we measure the SIP score between two users in the forum network via their explicit or implicit links, such as inter-relationships and shared SI measures the degree of social similarity between two users and is formulated as:
Popularity (P) score measures the social importance of a user in a forum network. The popularity score of a user should to-share (reply) of a user. Denote o ij as a post j authored by user i , and n formulated as: where Reply ( o ij )( Citation ( o ij )) are the number of replies (citations) for o number of replies (citations) in the discussion thread dataset. The variable k experiments, we compared the popularity scores generated according to three different sets of weight combination, {( w ( w , w ci ) = (0.5,0.5) have the best performance and use this weight setting for further score computation. Finally, combining SI and P scores, we have the SIP score formulated as: size identification of the experts with better profession background related to the questions and closer relationship to requesters, instead of those experts well-known in an online forum. 3.5. Social network-based Markov Chain (SNMC) analysis module
Knowledge sharing requires collaboration between the consumers and contributors of knowledge, namely the collabora-tors. Finding the right experts encourages knowledge sharing so that valuable knowledge embedded in the network can be effectively explored for the users. In this research, we apply a social network-based Markov Chain (SNMC) model to predict the most willing and capable experts for a requester X  X  query. We first give an intuitive description of the expert-finding process and then formally describe the SNMC model.

Suppose there are four users (requesters or experts), a 1 municate with each other by social activities, such as reply and citation. Suppose user a experts for answering his query. a 1 would ask one of his/her direct-linked friends (the first layer of a say a 2 , who is the most likely to solve his/her problem. If friend a his/her direct-liked friends (the second layer of a 1  X  X  social network). If a he/she may forward the query to a 4 . In this way, the requester a the transition probability of two direct-liked two users, we can compute the probability that a of requester a 1 by consequent state transition computation.
The calculation of transaction probability between two users in the proposed SNMC model is formally described as fol-ture to the Markov Chain model, we define that the requester r is the current state, and the friend f friend f i is formulated as: where S Reply ( f i , r ) is the total number of the replies which requester r sends to his/her direct-linked friend f is the total number of the replies which requester r sends to all his/her direct-linked friends.
 tween them is the product of all the two-step probability in a path from r to f n ability is assigned by the maximum one. Specifically, the transition probability between an arbitrary expert and the requester is formulated as: requester X  X  query. 3.6. Recommendation of threads and experts
Recommendation of threads is evaluated based on the ranking scores of discussion threads. Denote O ( d (author) of discussion thread d i . The thread ranking score of d where weight w 0 can be self-selected by the user to balance the importance of semantic and relation factors. to answer. The ranking score for an expert e i based on requester r X  X  social network is formulated as: 4. Experiments
In this section, we conduct empirical experiments using our proposed recommendation framework. 4.1. Data source
We conducted our experiments on FreeAdvice Legal Forum, 10
In early April 2009, we started to crawl related forum information including user ID, friend relations, personal profiles, threads posted and answered, citations, and messages left for each user. The following Table 1 shows some categories and the distribution of threads in the online forum.

For the purpose of comparison, we design two experiments ( Table 2 ):
All crawled threads have responses and each of them has at least three replies. We found that 95.7% of threads have amounts of replies ranging from 3 to 24. In addition, 73.1% of threads have number of replies ranging from 5 to 11, and 43.4% of threads have number of citations ranging from 1 to 4. Similar to the blogosphere space, the forum network has ness of the recommendation mechanism.

Experiment II. The strongly connected component (SCC) contains the users who frequently help each other (ask and answer who usually only answer the questions posted by  X  X  X CC X  X  users. The users in  X  X  X endrils/Tube X  X  component are those who only answer questions posed by  X  X  X n X  X  users and those whose questions are only answered by  X  X  X ut X  X  users. The result shows that seek help from volunteer helpers rather than people helping each other reciprocally. 4.2. Recommendation strategies
We design several different recommendation strategies to evaluate the proposed mechanism. The benchmark approaches and profession and reliability (PR) scores. These approaches are described as follows: (2) Profession and reliability (PR) strategy: This strategy is used to determine whether the recommended experts have the (4) Random strategy : This is a na X ve recommendation approach which makes recommendation based only on probability
In the experiments, there are two stages of recommendation. Stage 1 uses three strategies to recommend the relevant threads, and stage 2 includes five strategies to recommend the most willing and helpful human experts.
Stage 1: Recommendation of threads (1) SS + SIP. This approach uses weighted modified tf idf . We first test the weighting of SS and SIP and choose the (2) SS. This approach takes only the semantic similarity of contents into consideration. It is weighted with traditional (3) Random. This approach simply recommends the threads at random.

Stage 2: Recommendation of human experts (1) PR + SIP + SNMC. This approach uses the Markov Chain Model to predict the most suitable human experts. The layer (2) PR + SIP. This approach only combines the PR and SIP scores. (3) SIP. This approach only takes social intimacy and popularity into consideration. (4) PR. This approach considers the semantic similarity of professional domain and the expert X  X  level of expertise. (5) Random. This approach simply recommends experts at random. 4.3. Process of experiments
The experiments were performed using a real application domain, that is, an open platform where users can ask for pro-
Thus, we invited several human experts from a research institute laboratory with related knowledge management research background to be the evaluators. The human experts in our experiment are made up of six senior graduate students, four doctoral students, and one professor. As they were familiar and experienced with the related task X  X  execution, we consider the voting method (they marked each thread as  X  X  X elevant X  X  or  X  X  X rrelevant X  X ).

In our experiment, the two measures for rating the performance of the mechanism are precision rate and recall rate relevant records in the database. Denote R re as the set of relevant threads in the database (based on the recommendation of the invited human experts) and R T as the set of threads retrieved for a query. Precision rate ( P formulated as:
The entire procedures of experiments are described as follows: (1) Prepare the experiment data sources and construct the social network from FreeAdvice Legal Forum. In Experiment I, (2) Users are invited to initiate queries (ask questions). A query is composed of the information of topic, question (3) For each query, the system computes the RS Thread scores for ranking threads and the RS (4) For each query, human experts are invited to judge the relevance of the recommended threads and experts. The sys-(5) The precision and recall rates of various recommendation approaches are compared. The performance is evaluated on for legal service. We illustrate the system process in the following example:
A user ( X  X  X eductable rumb X  X ) seeks the supports related to a compensation problem following a traffic accident. He/she in these discussion threads. Therefore, the invited human experts could judge the relevance of the recommended threads according to the accessible information. Among these threads, threads (1) X (4) are judged as  X  X  X elevant. X  X  However, thread the hyperlinks to their profiles. Finally, the invited human experts make relevance judgement based on their information. 4.4. Results and evaluations 4.4.1. Results of Experiment I
Figs. 6 and 7 show the precision rate of the three strategies in Stage 1 (discussion threads recommendation). Owing to the and the requesters, we found that the requesters of these queries have a greater number of friends than average, but the knowledge domain of these queries is comparatively rare in the forum. As a result, the SS approach generates a better pre-cision rate than SS + SIP.

Figs. 8 and 9 show the precision rate of expert recommendation in Stage 2 of Experiment I. We can see that the perfor-beginning. The social network-based Markov Chain model plays an important role in finding helpful experts in showing that sometimes friends have complementary knowledge. Next, comparing the SIP strategy with the PR strategy, we find that the of the random approach. While the random approach has a better precision rate in expert finding than the SIP approach for some query (e.g., Q6 in Fig. 9 ), its overall performance is still the worst. The phenomenon that sometimes the random approach has a better precision rate is due to that the data in Experiment I was crawled from one subject domain, which increases the possibility for a random approach to select helpful experts. 4.4.2. Results of Experiment II
In Experiment II, in order to measure the recall rate performance, we reduced the number of threads crawled for each perts were invited to evaluate the relevance of the threads. Each thread was judged by 3 human experts who independently vote on its relevance. Each invited human expert evaluates approximate 270 threads on average in the experiment. The cannot be ignored in online forums of high diversity. Consistently, the performance of the random strategy is the lowest among the three strategies.
 age recall rate of experts in the online forums is based on the 50 most relevant experts recommended by the team of human experts. According to the overall performance of all queries, the proposed PR + SIP + SNMC mechanism is the best of the model is more comprehensible and effective, owing to the various sources in the experiment corpus. Finally, comparing the
II (multiple forums). 5. Conclusion
This paper proposes a social recommender system which includes semantic similarity, expertise, and social relation anal-yses for the support of knowledge sharing in online forum networks. The processes of recommendation include two phases: relevant discussion thread recommendation and helpful expert finding. In knowledge-centralized and highly diverse online forums, social intimacy and popularities improve recommendation effectiveness, as people who have the same interests and to help. Our experiment results show that the performance of the proposed recommendation mechanism outperforms those of other benchmark approaches. The study provides an efficient platform for the support of knowledge sharing, including recommending relevant discussion threads which are the best fit for the query and appropriate collaborators who are the tents and reduce the waiting time for expert responses.

Although our experimental results verify the superior performance of the proposed mechanism, there are still some as-pects which can be further improved upon. First, in our experiment design, we did not evaluate the proposed mechanism against other algorithms, such as HITS and PageRank; therefore, we could conduct further comparisons of our approach with egy dependent on each user X  X  evaluation and update the weights dynamically in each recommendation process. Third, the semantics of content can be further analyzed. If only the keywords (index terms) in the content are examined, some seman-tic information will be missing and some important cues may not be captured. As we focus on how to maintain and enhance the human experts X  knowledge domain and construct more complete semantic concepts for personal knowledge files, the semantic-expansion approach could be further utilized to widen the semantic analysis of discussion threads and users X  pro-fessional domains.
