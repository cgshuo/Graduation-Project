 With mobile devices, users no longer access the web from specific locations, but virtually from anywhere. How does this affect our ability to provide personalized information for users? In this talk, I will discuss the influence of location activity on use rs X  information needs and how a better understanding of these needs can help enhance web applications in which personalization plays a central role. H.3.3 Information Search and Retrieval  X  Information filtering Algorithms, Measurement, Human Factors . Context -based recommendation ; location -aware search; recommender system s; search personalization ; user modeling. Mobile devices have led to a paradigm shift from web use that is mainly performed in specific locations to web use that is being done virtually anywhere and is frequently re lated to the geographic environment. Considering user location therefore becomes fundamental to many web applications , in order to provide a better service for their users. In this talk, I will discuss the importance of understanding user location in order to enhance personalized search and recommendation. I will describe a model we developed to distinguish between web search in familiar places, which the user frequently visits, and unfamiliar places, which are seldom visited by the user [14]. I will demonstrate how this model can contribute to the understanding of both users and locations and how it can benefit applications such as search auto -completion. I will also discuss how user location can enhance research areas I have previously studied, including people search and expertise location [1,9,17], relationship analysis [12,13,15], crowdsourcing [2,4], people recommendation [6,8], content recommendation [10,11,16] , and social stream filtering [3,5,7].
