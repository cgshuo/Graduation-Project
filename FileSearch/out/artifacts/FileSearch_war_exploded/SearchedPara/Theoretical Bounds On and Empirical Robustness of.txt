We would like to bound the difference in regularized scores given differences in the similarity matrix. We will measure the change in regularized scores using the relative error be-tween scores, We will measure the difference in the similarity matrix ac-cording to the changes in the associated Laplacians, where the matrix norm is induced from the vector 2-norm.
Theorem 2.1. We omit the proof due to space constraints.

Noting that k  X   X   X   X  k  X  2 (proof omitted due to space The general behavior of this bound confirms an intuition we might have already. For low values of  X  , when two affinity measures are very similar, their regularized scores are very similar. In fact, for low values of  X  , the regularization is quite robust to arbitrary differences in the affinity. However, as we regularize more aggressively by using a higher  X  , the regularized solutions are more sensitive to perturbations of the affinity matrix.
The range of differences, 0  X  k  X   X   X   X  k  X  2, includes ar-bitrary matrix perturbations. In reality, our perturbations are likely to be constrained to differences much less than the maximum. In order to measure the empirical perturbations, we computed the differences between Laplacians using co-sine similarity of tf.idf vectors and the Hellinger similarity of language models. Our initial scores, y , were query likelihood retrievals of TREC queries 51-200 associated with the news portions of Tipster disks 1 and 2 [5]. We found that the mean value of k  X   X   X   X  k was 0 . 541  X  0 . 0585; this range is depicted in Figure 1. An expected perturbation in this range indicates that regularized scores will be very similar for 0  X   X   X  0 . 5. We plot the empirical regularization differences for various  X  for a fixed query with k  X   X   X   X  k = 0 . 510 in Figure 2. From this figure, it should be clear that our bound, because it considers arbitrary perturbations, is somewhat loose. The empirical evidence from other queries confirms that the dif-ference between these two affinity measures is likely to be far below our bound.

The bound established in Theorem 2.1 measures the effect of different similarity measures on norm of the difference be-tween the regularized scores. Because information retrieval is often evaluated by the induced ranking, it is worth explor-ing the effect on rankings resulting from different similarity measures. Therefore, for each pair of regularized rankings in our experiment, we compute the Plantagenet coefficient of rank similarity [3]. The Plantagenet is defined as, where x and y are vectors containing ranks of each docu-ment. The Plantagenet coefficient is a version of Spearman correlation sensitive to changes in the top ranks. This mea-sure is appropriate because, when comparing two rankings, we are most concerned with changes of the ranks of top-ranked documents. In Figure 3, we plot this correlation as a function of  X  . This figure gives us an intuition for the perceptible changes resulting from using different similarity measures. In fact, we see that, for all values of  X  , we achieve strong correlation between rankings.

In summary, we have studied the stability of regulariza-tion subject to changes of the parameter  X  . We found that, for small values of  X  , solutions are robust to small pertur-bations in the similarity matrix. For large  X  , regulariza-tion is more aggressive and solutions are more sensitive to changes in similarity. We complemented these theoretical results with empirical measurements of the effect of simi-larity matrix perturbations. We found that the differences between vector space model and language model similari-ties resulted only in slight differences in regularized scores and rank ordering of regularized scores. In future work, we would like to examine the empirical difference in regulariza-tion performance for other similarity measures.
