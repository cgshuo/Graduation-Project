 When people are seeking information they are interested in, they need time, need to know exactly what they are looking for and require attention capacities to check different sources. Recommender systems help to overcome the information overflow and filter out irrelevant sources by comparing different types of information and selecting the best results in consideration of customer preferences. Therefor e accurate customer profiles are necessary which nowadays do not ex ist. In a mobile environment customers are not willing to spend time on disclosing their preferences; maybe they are not aw are of them or have difficulties to respond to system requests. The paper in hand follows recommendations by critiquing to improve profiling quality but instead of collecting information, the transparent communication of profile extensions is fo cused. The customer can add preferences to his profile without explicitly expressing. Furthermore, the connection be tween proposed preferences and the systems conclusion behind is visible. H.m.

With the onset of the information society and the emergence of the information flow, the customer is confronted with the conflict between getting the information he is looking for and spending the time he is able to while search ing for what he is interested in [4, 5]. From a marketing perspective advertisers are very interested in addressing customer needs as well as possible but  X  X o give customers exactly what they want, you first have to learn what that is. It sounds simple, but it X  X  not X  [19]. At this time recommender systems gain significant importance by helping the customer to find what he is l ooking for, as e.g.  X  X uggesting ... those products which best suit his needs and preferences in a particular situation and context X  [7]. For example, Amazon is using recommender systems typically for products while Google is using them for individuali zed information provision. The quality of individualized recommendations strongly depends on the accuracy of customer profiles [12]. The consequent elicitation of customer preferences is a fundamental step in every recommender system [13]. Following this path customer profiles are one key factor, but in most cases there is less knowledge about customer preferences. Customers do not like to disclose lots of personal information, are not comp letely aware about them [6, 8] or  X  X ay also have difficulties in understanding the questions and the rationale of some system requests X  [13]. Checking the quality of customer inputs as a question of truthful statements is difficult [10]. Some statements are related to the benefit the customer is looking for. Ninety-four percent of all internet customers do not input personal information at a ll and forty percent of them disclose untruthful information [10]. Based on these facts recommender systems have lots of difficulties when operating on incomplete profiles. First ideas on how to derive customer preferences in a way that assists the customer by enhancing his own vi sible profile will be presented. This counteracts the development of not spending time on entering personal information, which is of importance when talking about a mobile environm ent, as well as not having to know how to express one X  X  own interests. This will lead to improved results of recommender sy stems to provide information based on more accurate, high quality customer profiles. This paper is structured as follo ws: section 2 introduces the state of the art of recommender systems, their current problems and explains what recommendation by critiquing is about. Section 3 explains how to extend customer profiles in a transparent, communicative way what the main contribution is and finally section 4 sums up the contribution. Assisting a customer by providing information he is probably looking for includes a more ge neral understanding about the decision process [9]. The qualitative decision theory, as described in [8], aims at automating preference modeling and decision making processes. It has devel oped procedures for correctly eliciting a complete model of customer preferences but most of them are much too complex to be handled in practical application areas [8].
