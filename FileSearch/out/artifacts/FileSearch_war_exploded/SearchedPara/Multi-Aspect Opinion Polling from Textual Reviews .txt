 This paper presents an unsupervised approach to aspect-based opinion polling from raw textual re views without explicit ratings. The key contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, a multi-aspect bootstrapping algorithm is proposed to learn from unlabeled data aspect-related terms of each aspect to be used for aspect identification. Second, an unsupervised segmentation model is proposed to address the challenge of identifying multiple single-aspect units in a multi-asp ect sentence. Finally, an aspect-based opinion polling algorithm is pr esented. Experiments on real Chinese restaurant reviews show that our opinion polling method can achieve 75.5% precision performance.

Algorithms, Experimentation Opinion polling, review mining, sentiment analysis With the growing availability of opinion-rich resources such as product reviews and personal blogs, an opinion poll is a popular way to present quantitative indication of user positive and negative opinions on social issues or products. In practice, for example, to investigate public opinions on restaurants, we care more about some particular aspects such as food or service instead of overall ratings. Nowadays pe ople increasingly express their opinions in the form of textual reviews without explicit numeral ratings, and often present diffe ring opinions on several aspects simultaneously in the same review. To handle such case, aspect-based sentiment analysis techniques are required [1][2]. In this paper we explore the problem of aspect-based opinion polling automatically from raw te xtual reviews without explicit ratings. An aspect-based opinion polling system takes as input a set of textual reviews and some pr edefined aspects, and identifies the polarity of each aspect fro m each review to produce an opinion poll. Here we first provide a Chinese restaurant review example to describe the asp ect-based opinion polling task. Sentence-1  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  Sentence-2  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  From the above review, a genera ted aspect-based opinion poll of five [aspect, polarity] pairs involving environment , discount policy , food , charge and service aspects, is shown in Table 1. Environment  X  Discount Policy 1  X  Like features used in previous st udies on sentiment analysis [3][4], in this study we consider two types of aspect-related terms (ARTs) for aspect identification, including word-type features such as nouns , verbs , adjectives, adverbs , and multi-word terms. To extract multi-word terms from unlabeled data, we utilize the C-value method [5] which takes as input a review set and produces a list of multi-word terms ranked in the descending order of Cvalue score . The Cvalue score of a multi-word term t can be calculated [5] by: z If t is not contained by any other terms z Otherwise The user did not provide any information on the aspect discount policy. In this case, we consider the polarity of the aspect discount policy as neutral (i.e. unknown). where |t| denotes the number of words contained by t , frq(t) set of multi-word terms containing t , and n(L) denotes the number of terms in S . A bootstrapping method starts learning with a small number of seed ARTs for each aspect under the help of unlabeled data. Bootstrapping can be viewed as iterative clustering where in each learning cycle the most valuable candidate is chosen to augment the current seed set, and the learning procedure continues until the predefined stopping criterion is satisfied. We utilize the RlogF metric [6] to evaluate each candidate ART t by where T is the current seed set, frq(t,T) is the frequency of co-occurrence of t and T within a limited context (i.e., k words to left corpus, and R(t,T)=frq(t,T)/frq(t) . For the purpose of aspect identification based on these learned ART sets, we need to assign each learned ART with an important score that indicates the degree of its ability of reflecting the corresponding aspect. The importance score SAB i (t) of an ART t for the i th aspect can be measured by means of a rank function as where S i ={ t i1 , t i2 , ..., t ik } is the ART set of the i by SAB. Notice that t ij is learned in the j th iteration, |S indicating in which iterati on it was learned. A higher SAB value indicates that t is a more important ART for the i Typically, we apply the bootstrapping method to learn an ART set for each aspect independently. We refer to this technique as single-aspect bootstrapping (SAB). However, we find that many ARTs occur in two or more SA B output lists, which means these ARTs belong to two or more aspects, named multi-aspect ARTs . The ambiguity degree AD(t) of a multi-aspect ART t can be measured by means of an entropy-like function of ranks of t in m SAB output lists as generated by SAB. The denominator is used for normalization. A higher AD(t) value indicates that the ART t is more ambiguous. By considering two above factors SAB importance score and ART ambiguity degree together, we present a new method for ART learning, namely multi-aspect bootstrapping (MAB). The importance score MAB i (t) of an ART t for the i calculated by Algorithm 1 : Multi-Aspect Bootstrapping Learning Input : initial aspect seed sets S ={ S 1 , S 2 , ..., S pool of unlabeled data U Stage 1: Candidate ART Extraction 
Extract nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and top-n multi-word terms recognized by C-value method from U to form a candidate ART set  X  for bootstrapping. Stage 2: Single-Aspect Bootstrapping Learning Start learning with the seed set S i for the i th aspect; 
Repeat 1. Use Equation (1) to calculate RlogF score of each candidate 2. Select the candidate with the highest RlogF score to Until the predefined stopping criterion 2 is met. Stage 3: Re-scoring For each ART set S i produced by SAB 1. Use Equation (4) to calculate MAB score of every ART in 2. Sort ARTs in the descending order of MAB score to produce Output : Final generated ART sets S * for m aspects. Many sentences in real reviews of ten involve two or more aspects. Let X  X  revisit the example shown in Fig. 1. The first sentence contains three single-aspect segments: an environment-segment (  X  X  X  X  X  / the environment is nice ), a food-segment ( the quality of food is so so ), and a charge-segment (  X  X  X  is very expensive ). We refer to such sentences as multi-aspect sentences . To handle such case, we propose a multi-aspect sentence segmentation (MAS) model that takes as input a multi-aspect sentence and produces multip le single-aspect segments. A single-aspect segment might be a sub-sentence 3 , or a combination of some consecutive sub-sentences. Let C=c 1 c 2 ...c n be a sentence C consisting of n sub-sentences, and let U=u segmentation of C consisting of k single-aspect segments. The MAS model can be formalized by introducing a new criterion function J(C,U) which aims to evaluate each candidate segmentation and assign a score to it. It seems an appealing solution by incorporating aspect information of segments into th e design of the criterion function implemented by using ART sets S={S 1 , S 2 , ..., S produced by SAB or MAB method. The j th aspect score of a The bootstrapping learning can end when a desirable number of 
ARTs have been learned. The separation mark between two adjacent sub-sentences is defined as a comma or a semicolon in a sentence. segment u i in U can be computed by suming the importance scores of all ARTs of the j th aspect in the segment, that is where t is an ART. The score(.) function represents SAB(.) or MAB(.). The most likely aspect j* of the segment u i is given by To determine whether two adjacent segments in U are associated with different aspects, we use an indicator function  X  (u aspects, and 0 otherwise.  X  (u 0 ,u 1 ) is assumed to be 1. The criterion function J(C,U) can be designed by In the final generated segmentation U* , we adjust the aspect of each segment based on the following rule: If the aspect score of the most likely aspect of a segment u i is less than a predefined threshold, the aspect of the segment u i is considered as NULL. An aspect-based opinion poll is described as a two-dimensional corresponding numbers, involving m aspects and three polarities (i.e. positive, negative and neutral). For each (aspect, polarity) pair, its associated number indi cates how many textual reviews express it. The aspect-based opinion polling can be summarized as follows: Algorithm 2 : Aspect-based Opinion Polling Input : a review set and m predefined aspects Step1 : For each review 1. Use the MAS method to implem ent the aspect segmentation 2. Identify the aspect and the polarity of each segment, and 3. Count the number of each (aspect, polarity) pair generated 4. If there is polarity conflict problem for one aspect, its 5. Output m final (aspect, polarity) pairs for this review. Step2 : Count the number of each (aspect, polarity) pair generated from the review set, and build an aspect-based opinion poll P by filled with the number of each (aspect, polarity) pair. Output : an aspect-based opinion poll In this work, a readily availa ble Chinese sentiment lexicon released by Hownet 4 is used for polarity analysis. This lexicon contains 3730 positive words and 3116 negative words. Thirteen negation words such as  X   X  /not X  are used in handling negation. http://www.keenage.com/html/c_index.html We adopt the sentiment-lexic on-based method [7] for segment polarity analysis, in which the semantic orientation value of a segment is to sum the polarity values of all sentiment words in the segment. The polarity value of a positive word is empirically set to +1, and set to -1 for a negative word. The resulting semantic orientation value of a segment indicates its corresponding polarity, that is, &gt;0 for positive, &lt;0 for negativ e, and equals to 0 for neutral. We evaluate our aspect-based opinion polling method on a corpus of real Chinese restaurant reviews taken from the website DianPing.com , which contains 13,358 reviews (54,747 sentences in total) for 100 restaurants. In the preprocessing step we utilized the NEUCSP 5 tool to implement Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging. We constructed a test set to evaluate the effectiveness of each polling method, which contains 3,325 reviews (11,606 sentences in total) for 25 randomly chosen restaurants. To form the gold standard, two human judges were as ked to label each review with five appropriate (aspect, polarity) pairs involving five aspects (i.e. environment, favorable policy, food, charge and service ) and their corresponding polarities (i.e. positive, negative or neutral ). For the disagreements between two j udges, a third human judge acted as an adjudicator. The rest of reviews were used as unlabeled data for bootstrapping-based ART learning. In C-value method, we considered bigrams , trigrams and 4-grams to be candidate multi-word terms. The l value of the limited context (used in Equation (1)) was empirically set to 5. The bootstrapping learning process stops when 2000 ARTs for each aspect have been learned. In each bootstrapping algorithms, five seeds were initially provided for each aspect as follows: 
Environment 
Discount Policy In the evaluation, we test four automatic opinion polling methods: 1) MAB+MAS method adopts MAB for ART learning, and MAS model for multi-aspect sentence segmentation; 2) MAB+Full-Stop method adopts MAB for ART learning, and simply considers the whole sentence as a single single-aspect segment NEUCSP is a Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging tool at (http://www.nlplab.com/chinese/source.htm) (i.e. namely full-stop-based method); 3) SAB+MAS method adopts SAB for ART learning, and MAS for multi-aspect sentence segmentation; 4) SAB+Full-Stop method adopts SAB for ART learning, and full-stop-based method for multi-aspect sentence segmentation. In the gold standard, each review was manually labeled with five appropriate (aspect polarity) pair s. Each automatic method also assigned five (aspect polarity) pairs to each review. In such case, actually the precision and recall metrics are same. To evaluate the effectiveness of each polling method, we adopted precision as the performance evaluation metric which measures the fraction of automatically identified (aspect, polarity) pairs that are correct. 
Table 3. Results of different automatic methods for aspect-Table 3 shows the effectiveness of each automatic method for aspect-based opinion poll ge neration. MAB+MAS method achieves the highest average precision of 75.5%, which does not use labeled data. Experimental resu lts show that in this task MAB outperforms SAB, and MAS is bette r than full-stop-based method. Aspect-based sentiment summarization [2][8][9] aims to produce a summary expressing the aggregated sentiment for each aspect and supporting textual evidence. From real restaurant reviews we find that many sentences express two or more aspects. However, the issue of multi-aspect sentence segmentation is seldom mentioned in previous studies. We propose here a MAS model to segment a multi-aspect sentence into multiple single-aspect segments. Another difference is th at our work focuses on aspect-based opinion poll generation inst ead of textual summarization generation. Some researchers [ 10][11] have applied bootstrapping method for learning subjective words or sentiment patterns, in the same fashion of our single-as pect bootstrapping method. We proposed a multi-aspect bootstrapping method for learning aspect-related terms for each aspect from unlabeled data. More recent work [12][13] has expanded polarity analysis on a multi-point scale under a ranking or ordinal regression framework. That is the most similar work to us. However, these previous studies focused on supervised or semi-supervised learning techniques for rating inference problem, which needs labeled data for training. However, in our work, no explicitly labeled data is used for training. This paper presents an unsupervised approach to aspect-based opinion polling from raw textual re views. From experimental results, we found a mixed opinion problem that the number of segments expressing positive on an aspect (e.g. food aspect) is approximately equal to the numbe r of other segments expressing negative on it in the same review. In such case, the predominant polarity of this aspect cannot be simply considered as positive or negative. The alternative way is to assign a degree score to each polarity expressed in such reviews. Actually our approach can be applied to aspect-based English language opinion poll generation if one of readily available English sentiment lexicons such as SentiWordNet 6 is used for polarity analysis. Since most readily available sentiment lexicons are general-purpose knowledge bases, it is worth studying how to automatically transfer a general-purpose sentiment lexicon in real domain applications to ach ieve better performance.
