 Clinical information retrieval (IR) presents several challenges including terminology mismatch and granularity mismatch. One of the main objectives in clinical IR is to fill the semantic gap among the queries and docu ments and go beyond keywords matching . To address these issues, in this paper we attempt to use semantic information to improve the performance of clinical IR systems by representing queries in an expressive and meaningful context. To model a query context init ially we model and develop query domain ontology. The query domain ontology represents concepts closely related with query concepts. Query context represents concepts extracted from query domain ontology and weighted according to their semantic relate dness to query concept( s ) . The query context is then exploited in query expansion and patients X  records re -ranking for improving clinical retrieval performance. W e evaluate our approach on the TREC M edical Records dataset. R esults show that our proposed approac h significantly improves the retrieval performance compare to classic keyword -based IR model.
 H.3.3 [ Information search and Retrieval ]: Retrieval models, Query formulation Algorithms, Performance, Experiment ation Clinical IR, Semantic r elatedness, Query context modeling Due to increasing volume of digitalized medical patient records, the need for advanced information retrieval systems increases. Digitalized medical patient records contai n valuable information that are usually embedded in medical reports in the form of medical history, allergies, lab results, discharge summaries and progress notes. This makes it difficult for clinicians to rapidly and effectively access the desired records and the need for effective IR system arises. One of the main objectives in clinical IR is to fill the semantic gap between the queries and docu ments and go beyond keywords matching . One of the characteristics of semantic search is conceptual representation rather than simple keywords to enha nce the representation of queries and documents. Modeling and developing domain ontologies is a fundamental framework for representing knowledge using a set of concepts and the relationships among the concepts. Medical domain knowledge is developed by seve ral different ontologies including Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The UMLS Metathesaurus contains millions of biomedical and health related concepts. This thesaurus is classified by concept s and connects each concept to its alternative names and v ie ws in other source vocabularies. I t also determines appropriate relationships among concepts. The structural framework of UMLS ontologies aids us in categorizing concepts and locating related and similar concepts automatically. Achieving an IR model capa ble of exploiting semantics requires proper re latedness/similarity measures [6 ]. Semantic relatedness and semantic similarity in medical domain are useful measures for effective natural language processing, artificial intelligence and IR . Similarity measur es determine how similar two concepts are by calculating how close they are in the UMLS semantic network hierarchy. Relatedness measures determine how related two concepts are by using concepts definition information.
 Clinical IR presents several specific challenges such as granularity mismatch [12 ] and terminology mismatch. In [12 ] authors tackle the issue of granularity mismatch by exploiting subsumption relationships extracted from medical domain knowledge resources, where subsumption relationships are d efined as parent -child relationships when one concept is a subset of another concept. Keyword -based IR models could return imprecise and erroneous results due to their dependency on specific keywords. Concept -based representation approaches are intended to overcome this limitation by representing queries and documents with semantic concepts using biomedical resources such as UMLS. However previous work demonstrated that these approaches should be combined with term -based approaches for better p erformance [9 ]. In [5 ] authors tackle the issue of terminology mismatch by proposing a technique to represent queries with only medical concepts crucial to information need. In their method, they represent queries and documents using medical concepts that are directly related to symptoms, diagnosis, diagnosis test and treatment. One of the other challenges in medical IR is to retrieve those relevant documents that don X  X  contain queries X  concepts but contain concep ts that are associated with them. For example a query may contain specific disease whereas the relevant document may contain symptoms of that disease. Our proposed approach attempts to address the presented challenges by modeling meaningful and expressive query context that represents the most related concepts t o query concepts . In this paper, we propose a novel IR approach that is able to tackle the presented challenges of clinical IR such as terminology mismatch and granularity mismatch and to capture those relevant documents not containing queries X  keywords ex plicitly. The proposed model also attempts to fulfill the objective of filling semantic gap between queries and documents. This model is capable of combining search by meaning and search by keywor d and it uses a WordNet -based [6 ] semantic relatedness measu re to calculate relatedness of pair of concepts. In this approach we develop query domain ontology for each query using the UMLS ontology. Concepts in the domain ontology are then weighted according to their relatedness to the original query concepts. Quer y context contains all the concepts in query domain ontology that have a related score above a specific threshold. The query context is used to enhance classical IR model and to calculate and assign a new score to documents by considering semantics. The ke y unique contributions in our paper concern (1) modeling query domain ontologies to extract representative concepts to information need and (2) modeling medical query context based on the modeled ontology and weight the concepts semantically in relation to the query according to a semantic -based concept weighting schema. Our approach attempts to enhance classical IR model by exploiting semantic relatedness to fulfill the objective of searching by meaning representation of content. To achieve this, we model a query context for each query, where each concept is weighted according to i ts relatedness to query concept( s ) . The query context is then exploited in the patient records query expansion and re -ranking for improving clinical retrie val performance.
 A prerequisite step for modeling a representative query context is modeling query domain ontology. In order to find the most qualified concepts representing query context we model and develop query domain ontology for each query using UMLS Metathesaurus. To develop query domain ontology, first we map query keywords to UMLS concepts using Meta Map [1 ] . Meta Map is a program developed by National Library of Medicine (NLM), which map s biomedical texts to the UMLS Metathesaurus . S econd we extract all the concepts that have semantic relationship with the query concept( s ) in UMLS ontologies. The Metathesaurus contains synonymous and non -synonymous relationships between concepts from the same source vocabulary as well as concepts in different vocabul aries. In general, the relationships connect closely related concepts, such as those that share some common property or are related by definition. Semantic relationships can be of different types including SY (synonym), RB (broader relationship), RN (narro wer r elationship), SIB (sibling) etc . The main motivation for including synonymous and non -synonymous relationships for modeling query concepts domain ontology is to capture all the concepts closely related to the query concept ( s ) . Concepts extraction is c apped at second level to avoid concepts that are not in a close relation with query concepts. This ontology is capable of addressing the issue of granularity mismatch by including the parent -child relationship, where the child concept is a subset of the pa rent concept. This ontology is also capable of tackling the problem of retrieving those relevant documents not containing queries X  keywords explicitly but containing concepts semantically related to the queries, since it includes alternative names and view s of the same concept as well as concepts that are close ly related to the query concept( s ) . Figure 1 demonstrates Hearing Impairment domain ontology. Medical query domain ontology is capable of expressing the close relationship of diseases (Hearing Impair ment and Hearing Loss) disease and symptom (Hearing Impairment and Buzzing in Ear) and disease and treatment (Hearing Impairment and Hearing Aid). Therefore, according to this ontology if a document doesn X  X  contain hearing impairment concept but contains t he associated treatment Hearing aid, our proposed model will retrieve it since it contains a concept that is in hearing impairment domain ontology. However related concepts receive a different weight from the original query concept( s ) .
 The query context of each query consists of all the concepts in their modeled domain ontology. In order to identify the extent of a concept relevancy in relation with query concept we weight each concept in query domain ontology according to its semantic relatedness to the qu ery concept. For the purpose of this study we use Gloss Vector semantic [8 ] relatedness measure. This choice relies on the fact that this measure relies on concepts definitions information rather than semantic network hierarchy; therefore it is able to cal culate semantic relatedness of pair of concepts in different UMLS ontologies. T his measure represents concepts by vector s of co -occurrences . C o -occurrences refer to words that commonly occur close to each other in a corpus of text. This measure calculate s relatedness of pair of concepts by combining the structure and content of WordNet with co -occurrence information . The value of semantic relatedness indicates the relatedness of pair of concepts, the higher the value the higher the semantic relatedness. T he semantic relatedness of pair of concepts is between 0 and 1, the value is 1 if two concepts are identical and 0 if they are not related.
 Therefore the query context is presented as:  X  X  X  X  ! =  X  ! ! ,  X  X  X  X   X  ! ,  X  ! ! , ...  X  !" ,  X  X  X  X   X  ! ,  X  !"  X  X  X  X  (  X  ! ,  X  ! ! ! ) ) , ...  X  !"# ,  X  X  X  X   X  ! ,  X  !"# 0 &lt;  X  ,  X  &lt;  X  C represents the query concept, C i n represents first level concepts and C inj represents second level concept s, where i is the number of query concepts , n is the number of fi rst level concepts and j is a number of second level concepts . rel represents the score calculated by measuring semantic relatedness of pair of concepts using Gloss Vector measure. rel(C i ,C inj ) represents semantic relatedness of related concepts in relatio n with the query concept; which is assigned to each concept as its weight. The r elatedness of pair of concepts is measured by calculating the cosine of the angle between v 1 and v 2 . v 1 and v 2 represent the context vector of co -o ccurrence data of C 1 and C 2 [8 ] .
 We use the modeled query context to expand the original queries where concepts are presented using their preferred terms. The preferred term is the string preferred in UMLS Metathesaurus as the name of the concept. The query expansion process is performed by integrating the keyword -based query context in to the IR process, where we use DFR -based dependence model. Since our model can only take advantage of query terms, it is necessary to refine initial retrieval results by taking concepts into consideration [11 ]. To re -rank the initial results according to query context, documents are semantically indexed using Meta Map [1] and represented by concept unique identifiers (CUI). The re -ranking process is performed by integrating the CUI -based quer y context CTX q into the IR process. For each document d retrieved, we combine the in i tial score S i based on DFR -based dependence model and the con ceptual score S c based on cosine measure between the conceptual representation of d k We combine S i and S c using a tuning parameter  X  to balance the impact of the original score S i and the new score S c  X   X  ! = 1  X   X  .  X  !  X  ,  X  ! +  X  .  X  !  X  X  X  X  ! ,  X  ! 0 &lt;  X  &lt; 1 The conceptual score is computed using cosine similarit y measure between the initial retrieved results and concepts in the CUI -based query context obtained from modeled query domain ontology and weighted according to their semant ic relatedness to query concept( s ) . In our search experiments, we examine the impact of combining conceptual search using query context with the standard retrieval and compare it with the standard retrieval perfor mance using the original keyword -based queries. The standard retrieval is based on DFR -based dependence model [7]. We use Terrier [7 ] for indexing and retrieval of term -based representation where we apply porter stemming and we remove general stop words. W e also added specific stop words that are very frequent in medical domain such as patient, hospital, medical, etc as suggested by [2 ]. For query context modeling we conduct experiments to find the optimal value for  X  and weight threshold. Query context contains concepts with weight or semantic relatedness higher than or equal to the weight threshold. To tune the parameter  X  , we vary it in [0 1] in equation 3. Figure 2 presents performance measures in different values of  X  . According to F igure 2 we can confirm that the best value for parameter  X  is 0.2. In order to find the optimal threshold for weight restrictions, we conduct different runs to evaluate the impact of this parameter on retrieval performance. Figure 3 pr esents the impact of modeling query context based on weights equal to or higher than 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85 and 0.9. For each value we perform conceptual re -ranking of results obtained from query expansion and results confirm that the optimal weight threshol d to model query context is 0.9.
 The corpus that is used to develop and test our approach is provided w ithin the context of the TREC [10 ] Medical Records Track 2011 challenge and is composed of query set, patients X  records and relevance judgments. Each top ic specifies a particular disease/condition set and/or a particular treatment/intervention set. The patients X  records are a set of de -identified electronic medical records. These documents are organized by vi sits and there are a total of 17,267 visits and 101 X 711 reports in which, each visit contains between 1 to 415 reports. Relevance judgments are binary and reflect whether a visit is relevant or not with respect to the query.
 Figure 2 . Comparison of parameter  X  , X -axis indicates parameter  X  and Y  X  axis indicates value of performance measures Figure 3 . Comparison of weight restriction , X -axis indicates parameter weight threshold and Y  X  axis indicates value of performance measures Our evaluation objective is to evaluate the performance of combining conceptual search with standard retrieval and compare it to standard retrieval. Our hypothesis is that combining our method of conceptual search with classic term -based IR m odel improves the retrieval performance. Table 1 presents the retrieval performance of the runs using TREC X  X  official measures: MAP , R -precision, bprerf, precision@5 (P@5) and precision@10 (P@10). The baseline -Termbased run is based on DFR -based (Divergen ce from Randomness) dependence model, which incorporates term dependency in the DF R framework. This run is based o n sequential dependency (SD) and is performed using term -based representation of documents and queries. The conceptual -DFR run is based on re -ranking the results that are obtained from query expansion using keyword -based query context. The query expansion is performed by integrating the keyword -based query context into DFR -based sequential dependence model where concepts are presented as keyword s rather than CUIs . Results are then re -ranked based on the CUI -based query context using the conceptual representation of documents. In this run documents scores are calculated based on eq. 3. This run is based on  X  =0.2 and weight threshold of 0.9 , which were found to be effective in our experimental settings . The results show that our proposed approach (conceptual -DFR) outperforms the baseline -Termbased run at all official measures especially at P @5. This suggests the effectiveness of medical query doma in ontology for extracting associated diseases, treatments and symptoms. The positive results also indicate the usefulness of combing semantic search with standard retrieval model. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our approach after applying rocchio X  s query expansion mechanism. The DFR -QE run is based on DFR -based sequential dependence model using rocchio X  X  query expansion mechanism from Terrier (default values of beta=0.4, 10 expansion documents and 40 expansion terms). This run is performed using te rm -based representation of queries and documents. The Conceptual -DFR -QE is based on re -ranking the results obtained from our proposed query expansion and applying rocchio X  X  query expansion mechanism. The conceptual query expansion is performed by integrati ng the keyword -based query context into DFR -based sequential dependence model using keyword -based query context with  X  =0.2 and weight threshold of 0.9 . The conceptual re -ranking is performed using the conceptual representation of documents where documents X  scores are calculated using eq. 3. As T able 1 demonstrates, Terrier X  X  rocchio query expan sion mechanism (DFR -QE) improves the retrieval performance compare to baseline. Our proposed approach (Conceptual -DFR -QE) improves the results significantly at all the performance measures compare to baseline. This run also improves the retrieval performan ce at all the performance measu res compare d to DFR -QE ( MAP by 19.5 %, R -prec by 13%, bpref by 23%, p@5 by 28% and p@10 by 19 %). Results from conceptual runs foster the effectiveness of combining the conceptual search based on proposed query context modeling with DFR -based dependence IR model.
 Table 1, also lists the best -submitted run in medical TREC 2011 challenge (Best -TREC). Participants of the track did not report MAP and P@5. Comparing our best run (conceptual -DFR -QE) with the best system reported at T REC 2011 (Best -TREC), we observe that our approach performs better than the best reported system at TREC 2011 in terms of bpref. However TREC 2011 best system relies on detection of negation and conditionals, which is not handled in our approach.
 Overall, our proposed approach is promising. This is b ecause the results generated from our approach significantly ( s tatistical significance for our approach is denoted * over Baseline -Termbased in Table 1 ) improve the performance compare d to the term -based baselin e run and term -based rocchio query expansion run at all the TREC X  X  official per formance measures especially at P@5 . In this paper we present a novel medical query context modeling based on query domain ontology that is modeled and developed from UMLS Metathesaurus . Query domain ontology represents co ncepts related to query concept( s ) . Concepts in the query context are weighted according to their semantic r elatedness to the query concept( s ) . The query context is exploited for re -ranking clinical search results obtained from classical IR model. We evaluate our proposed approach on the challenging ad -hoc retrieval task of TREC medical records track. Results show that our proposed approach impr oves the retrieval performance at all the TREC X  X  official measures. The results suggest the effectiveness of combining conceptual search using query context modeling with standard term -based retrieval. Experimental r esults also indicate the capability of q uery domain ontology in expressing closely related concepts. For future work, we plan to do the retrieval process based on calculating the relatedness of query concepts with document X  X  keywords using definition information and co -occurrence information.
