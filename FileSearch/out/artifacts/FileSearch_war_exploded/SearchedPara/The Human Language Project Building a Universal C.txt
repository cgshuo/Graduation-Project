 The grand aim of linguistics is the construction of a universal theory of human language. To a com-putational linguist, it seems obvious that the first step is to collect significant amounts of primary data for a large variety of languages. Ideally, we would like a complete digitization of every human language: a Universal Corpus.

If we are ever to construct such a corpus, it must be now. With the current rate of language loss, we have only a small window of opportunity before the data is gone forever. Linguistics may be unique among the sciences in the crisis it faces. The next generation will forgive us for the most egregious shortcomings in theory construction and technol-ogy development, but they will not forgive us if we fail to preserve vanishing primary language data in a form that enables future research.

The scope of the task is enormous. At present, we have non-negligible quantities of machine-readable data for only about 20 X 30 of the world X  X  6,900 languages (Maxwell and Hughes, 2006). Linguistics as a field is awake to the crisis. There has been a tremendous upsurge of interest in doc-umentary linguistics, the field concerned with the the  X  X reation, annotation, preservation, and dis-semination of transparent records of a language X  (Woodbury, 2010). However, documentary lin-guistics alone is not equal to the task. For example, no million-word machine-readable corpus exists for any endangered language, even though such a quantity would be necessary for wide-ranging in-vestigation of the language once no speakers are available. The chances of constructing large-scale resources will be greatly improved if computa-tional linguists contribute their expertise.
This collaboration between linguists and com-putational linguists will extend beyond the con-struction of the Universal Corpus to its exploita-tion for both theoretical and technological ends. We envisage a new paradigm of universal linguis-tics, in which grammars of individual languages are built from the ground up, combining expert manual effort with the power tools of probabilis-tic language models and grammatical inference. A universal grammar captures redundancies which exist across languages, constituting a  X  X niversal linguistic prior, X  and enabling us to identify the distinctive properties of specific languages and families. The linguistic prior and regularities due to common descent enable a new economy of scale for technology development: cross-linguistic tri-angulation can improve performance while reduc-ing per-language data requirements.

Our aim in the present paper is to move beyond generalities to a concrete plan of attack, and to challenge the field to a communal effort to cre-ate a Universal Corpus of the world X  X  languages, in consistent machine-readable format, permitting large-scale cross-linguistic processing. 2.1 Aims and scope Although language endangerment provides ur-gency, the corpus is not intended primarily as a Noah X  X  Ark for languages. The aims go be-yond the current crisis: we wish to support cross-linguistic research and technology development at the largest scale. There are existing collections that contain multiple languages, but it is rare to have consistent formats and annotation across lan-guages, and few such datasets contain more than a dozen or so languages.

If we think of a multi-lingual corpus as con-sisting of an array of items, with columns repre-senting languages and rows representing resource types, the usual focus is on  X  X ertical X  processing. Our particular concern, by contrast, is  X  X orizontal X  processing that cuts indiscriminately across lan-guages. Hence we require an unusual degree of consistency across languages.

The kind of processing we wish to enable is much like the large-scale systematic research that motivated the Human Genome Project.
 We wish to make it possible to investigate human language equally systematically and on an equally grand scale: a Human Linguome Project, as it were, though we have chosen the  X  X uman Lan-guage Project X  as a more inviting title for the un-dertaking. The product is a Universal Corpus, 1 in two senses of universal: in the sense of including (ultimately) all the world X  X  languages, and in the sense of enabling software and processing meth-ods that are language-universal.

However, we do not aim for a collection that is universal in the sense of encompassing all lan-guage documentation efforts. Our goal is the con-struction of a specific resource, albeit a very large resource. We contrast the proposed effort with general efforts to develop open resources, stan-dards, and best practices. We do not aim to be all-inclusive. The project does require large-scale col-laboration, and a task definition that is simple and compelling enough to achieve buy-in from a large number of data providers. But we do not need and do not attempt to create consensus across the en-tire community. (Although one can hope that what proves successful for a project of this scale will provide a good foundation for future standards.)
Moreover, we do not aim to collect data merely in the vague hope that it will prove use-ful. Although we strive for maximum general-ity, we also propose a specific driving  X  X se case, X  namely, machine translation (MT), (Hutchins and Somers, 1992; Koehn, 2010). The corpus pro-vides a testing ground for the development of MT system-construction methods that are dramatically  X  X eaner X  in their resource requirements, and which take advantage of cross-linguistic bootstrapping. The large engineering question is how one can turn the size of the task X  X onstructing MT systems for all the world X  X  languages simultaneously X  X o one X  X  advantage, and thereby consume dramati-cally less data per language.

The choice of MT as the use case is also driven by scientific considerations. To explain, we re-quire a bit of preamble.

We aim for a digitization of each human lan-guage. What exactly does it mean to digitize an entire language? It is natural to think in terms of replicating the body of resources available for well-documented languages, and the pre-eminent resource for any language is a treebank. Producing a treebank involves a staggering amount of man-ual effort. It is also notoriously difficult to obtain agreement about how parse trees should be defined in one language, much less in many languages si-multaneously. The idea of producing treebanks for 6,900 languages is quixotic, to put it mildly. But is a treebank actually necessary?
Let us suppose that the purpose of a parse tree is to mediate interpretation. A treebank, ar-guably, represents a theoretical hypothesis about how interpretations could be constructed; the pri-mary data is actually the interpretations them-selves. This suggests that we annotate sentences with representations of meanings instead of syn-tactic structures. Now that seems to take us out of the frying pan into the fire. If obtaining consen-sus on parse trees is difficult, obtaining consensus on meaning representations is impossible. How-ever, if the language under consideration is any-thing other than English, then a translation into English (or some other reference language) is for most purposes a perfectly adequate meaning rep-resentation. That is, we view machine translation as an approximation to language understanding.
Here is another way to put it. One measure of adequacy of a language digitization is the abil-ity of a human X  X lready fluent in a reference language X  X o acquire fluency in the digitized lan-guage using only archived material. Now it would be even better if we could use a language digiti-zation to construct an artificial speaker of the lan-guage. Importantly, we do not need to solve the AI problem: the speaker need not decide what to say, only how to translate from meanings to sentences of the language, and from sentences back to mean-ings. Taking sentences in a reference language as the meaning representation, we arrive back at ma-chine translation as the measure of success. In short, we have successfully captured a language if we can translate into and out of the language.
The key resource that should be built for each language, then, is a collection of primary texts with translations into a reference language.  X  X ri-mary text X  includes both written documents and transcriptions of recordings. Large volumes of pri-mary texts will be useful even without translation for such tasks as language modeling and unsuper-vised learning of morphology. Thus, we antici-pate that the corpus will have the usual  X  X yrami-dal X  structure, starting from a base layer of unan-notated text, some portion of which is translated into a reference language at the document level to make the next layer. Note that, for maximally au-thentic primary texts, we assume the direction of translation will normally be from primary text to reference language, not the other way around.
Another layer of the corpus consists of sentence and word alignments, required for training and evaluating machine translation systems, and for extracting bilingual lexicons. Curating such anno-tations is a more specialized task than translation, and so we expect it will only be done for a subset of the translated texts.

In the last and smallest layer, morphology is an-notated. This supports the development of mor-phological analyzers, to preprocess primary texts to identify morpheme boundaries and recognize allomorphs, reducing the amount of data required for training an MT system. This most-refined target annotation corresponds to the interlinear glossed texts that are the de facto standard of anno-tation in the documentary linguistics community.
We postulate that interlinear glossed text is suf-ficiently fine-grained to serve our purposes. It invites efforts to enrich it by automatic means: for example, there has been work on parsing the English translations and using the word-by-word glosses to transfer the parse tree to the object lan-guage, effectively creating a treebank automati-cally (Xia and Lewis, 2007). At the same time, we believe that interlinear glossed text is sufficiently simple and well-understood to allow rapid con-struction of resources, and to make cross-linguistic consistency a realistic goal.

Each of these layers X  X rimary text, translations, alignments, and morphological glosses X  X eems to be an unavoidable piece of the overall solution. The fact that these layers will exist in diminishing quantity is also unavoidable. However, there is an important consequence: the primary texts will be permanently subject to new translation initiatives, which themselves will be subject to new align-ment and glossing initiatives, in which each step is an instance of semisupervised learning (Abney, 2007). As time passes, our ability to enhance the quantity and quality of the annotations will only increase, thanks to effective combinations of auto-matic, professional, and crowd-sourced effort. 2.2 Principles The basic principles upon which the envisioned corpus is based are the following: Universality. Covering as many languages as possible is the first priority. Progress will be gauged against concrete goals for numbers of lan-guages, data per language, and coverage of lan-guage families (Whalen and Simons, 2009).
 Machine readability and consistency.  X  X over-ing X  languages means enabling machine process-ing seamlessly across languages. This will sup-port new types of linguistic inquiry and the devel-opment and testing of inference methods (for mor-phology, parsers, machine translation) across large numbers of typologically diverse languages. Community effort. We cannot expect a single organization to assemble a resource on this scale. It will be necessary to get community buy-in, and many motivated volunteers. The repository will not be the sole possession of any one institution. Availability. The content of the corpus will be available under one or more permissive licenses, such as the Creative Commons Attribution Li-cense (CC-BY), placing as few limits as possible on community members X  ability to obtain and en-hance the corpus, and redistribute derivative data. Utility. The corpus aims to be maximally use-ful, and minimally parochial. Annotation will be as lightweight as possible; richer annotations will will emerge bottom-up as they prove their utility at the large scale.
 Centrality of primary data. Primary texts and recordings are paramount. Secondary resources such as grammars and lexicons are important, but no substitute for primary data. It is desirable that secondary resources be integrated with X  X f not de-rived from X  X rimary data in the corpus. 2.3 What to include What should be included in the corpus? To some extent, data collection will be opportunistic, but it is appropriate to have a well-defined target in mind. We consider the following essential.
 Metadata. One means of resource identification is to survey existing documentation for the lan-guage, including bibliographic references and lo-cations of web resources. Provenance and proper citation of sources should be included for all data. For written text. (1) Primary documents in original printed form, e.g. scanned page images or PDF. (2) Transcription. Not only optical charac-ter recognition output, but also the output of tools that extract text from PDF, will generally require manual editing.
 For spoken text. (1) Audio recordings. Both elicited and spontaneous speech should be in-cluded. It is highly desirous to have some con-nected speech for every language. (2) Slow speech  X  X udio transcriptions. X  Carefully respeaking a spoken text can be much more efficient than writ-ten transcription, and may one day yield to speech recognition methods. (3) Written transcriptions. We do not impose any requirements on the form of transcription, though orthographic transcription is generally much faster to produce than phonetic transcription, and may even be more useful as words are represented by normalized forms.
 For both written and spoken text. (1) Trans-lations of primary documents into a refer-ence language (possibly including commentary). (2) Sentence-level segmentation and transla-tion. (3) Word-level segmentation and glossing. (4) Morpheme-level segmentation and glossing.
All documents will be included in primary form, but the percentage of documents with man-ual annotation, or manually corrected annotation, decreases at increasingly fine-grained levels of an-notation. Where manual fine-grained annotation is unavailable, automatic methods for creating it (at a lower quality) are desirable. Defining such meth-ods for a large range of resource-poor languages is an interesting computational challenge.
 Secondary resources. Although it is possible to base descriptive analyses exclusively on a text cor-pus (Himmelmann, 2006, p. 22), the following secondary resources should be secured if they are available: (1) A lexicon with glosses in a reference language. Ideally, everything should be attested in the texts, but as a practical matter, there will be words for which we have only a lexical entry and no instances of use. (2) Paradigms and phonol-ogy, for the construction of a morphological ana-lyzer. Ideally, they should be inducible from the texts, but published grammatical information may go beyond what is attested in the text. 2.4 Inadequacy of existing efforts Our key desideratum is support for automatic pro-cessing across a large range of languages. No data collection effort currently exists or is proposed, to our knowledge, that addresses this desideratum. Traditional language archives such as the Audio Archive of Linguistic Fieldwork (UC Berkeley), Documentation of Endangered Languages (Max Planck Institute, Nijmegen), the Endangered Lan-guages Archive (SOAS, University of London), and the Pacific And Regional Archive for Digi-tal Sources in Endangered Cultures (Australia) of-fer broad coverage of languages, but the majority of their offerings are restricted in availability and do not support machine processing. Conversely, large-scale data collection efforts by the Linguis-tic Data Consortium and the European Language Resources Association cover less than one percent of the world X  X  languages, with no evident plans for major expansion of coverage. Other efforts con-cern the definition and aggregation of language resource metadata, including OLAC, IMDI, and CLARIN (Simons and Bird, 2003; Broeder and Wittenburg, 2006; V  X  aradi et al., 2008), but this is not the same as collecting and disseminating data.
Initiatives to develop standard formats for lin-guistic annotations are orthogonal to our goals. The success of the project will depend on con-tributed data from many sources, in many differ-ent formats. Converting all data formats to an official standard, such as the RDF-based models being developed by ISO Technical Committee 37 Sub-committee 4 Working Group 2, is simply im-practical. These formats have onerous syntactic and semantic requirements that demand substan-tial further processing together with expert judg-ment, and threaten to crush the large-scale collab-orative data collection effort we envisage, before it even gets off the ground. Instead, we opt for a very lightweight format, sketched in the next sec-tion, to minimize the effort of conversion and en-able an immediate start. This does not limit the options of community members who desire richer formats, since they are free to invest the effort in enriching the existing data. Such enrichment ef-forts may gain broad support if they deliver a tan-gible benefit for cross-language processing. Here we sketch a simple approach to storage of texts (including transcribed speech), bitexts, inter-linear glossed text, and lexicons. We have been deliberately schematic since the goal is just to give grounds for confidence that there exists a general, scalable solution.

For readability, our illustrations will include space-separated sequences of tokens. However, behind the scenes these could be represented as a sequence of pairs of start and end offsets into a primary text or speech signal, or as a sequence of integers that reference an array of strings. Thus, when we write (1a), bear in mind it may be imple-mented as (1b) or (1c). (1) a. This is a point of order .
In what follows, we focus on the minimal re-quirements for storing and disseminating aligned text, not the requirements for efficient in-memory data structures. Moreover, we are agnostic about whether the normalized, tokenized format is stored entire or computed on demand.

We take an aligned text to be composed of a series of aligned sentences, each consisting of a small set of attributes and values, e.g.: The value of ID identifies the document and sen-tence, and any collection to which the document belongs. Individual components of the identi-fier can be referenced or retrieved. The LANGS attribute identifies the source and reference lan-guage using ISO 639 codes. 2 The SENT attribute contains space-delimited tokens comprising a sen-tence. Optional attributes TRANS and ALIGN hold the translation and alignment, if these are available; they are omitted in monolingual text. A provenance attribute records any automatic or manual processes which apply to the record, and a revision attribute contains the version number, timestamp, and username associated with the most recent modification of the record, and a rights at-tribute contains copyright and license information.
When morphological annotation is available, it is represented by two additional attributes, LEX and AFF . Here is a monolingual example: Note that combining all attributes of these two examples X  X hat is, combining word-by-word translation with morphological analysis X  X ields interlinear glossed text.

A bilingual lexicon is an indispensable re-source, whether provided as such, induced from a collection of aligned text, or created by merg-ing contributed and induced lexicons. A bilin-gual lexicon can be viewed as an inventory of cross-language correspondences between words or groups of words. These correspondences are just aligned text fragments, albeit much smaller than a sentence. Thus, we take a bilingual lexicon to be a kind of text in which each record contains a single lexeme and its translation, represented us-ing the LEX and TRANS attributes we have already introduced, e.g.:
In sum, the Universal Corpus is represented as a massive store of records, each representing a single sentence or lexical entry, using a limited set of attributes. The store is indexed for effi-cient access, and supports access to slices identi-fied by language, content, provenance, rights, and so forth. Many component collections would be  X  X nioned X  into this single, large Corpus, with only the record identifiers capturing the distinction be-tween the various data sources.

Special cases of aligned text and wordlists, spanning more than 1,000 languages, are Bible translations and Swadesh wordlists (Resnik et al., 1999; Swadesh, 1955). Here there are obvious use-cases for accessing a particular verse or word across all languages. However, it is not neces-sary to model n -way language alignments. In-stead, such sources are implicitly aligned by virtue of their structure. Extracting all translations of a verse, or all cognates of a Swadesh wordlist item, is an index operation that returns monolin-gual records, e.g.: Data collection on this scale is a daunting prospect, yet it is important to avoid the paraly-sis of over-planning. We can start immediately by leveraging existing infrastructure, and the volun-tary effort of interested members of the language resources community. One possibility is to found a  X  X anguage Commons, X  an open access reposi-tory of language resources hosted in the Internet Archive, with a lightweight method for commu-nity members to contribute data sets.

A fully processed and indexed version of se-lected data can be made accessible via a web ser-vices interface to a major cloud storage facility, such as Amazon Web Services. A common query interface could be supported via APIs in multi-ple NLP toolkits such as NLTK and GATE (Bird et al., 2009; Cunningham et al., 2002), and also in generic frameworks such as UIMA and SOAP, leaving developers to work within their preferred environment. 4.1 Motivation for data providers We hope that potential contributors of data will be motivated to participate primarily by agree-ment with the goals of the project. Even some-one who has specialized in a particular language or language family maintains an interest, we ex-pect, in the universal question X  X he exploration of Language writ large.

Data providers will find benefit in the availabil-ity of volunteers for crowd-sourcing, and tools for (semi-)automated quality control, refinement, and presentation of data. For example, a data holder should be able to contribute recordings and get help in transcribing them, through a combination of volunteer labor and automatic processing.
Documentary linguists and computational lin-guists have much to gain from collaboration. In re-turn for the data that documentary linguistics can provide, computational linguistics has the poten-tial to revolutionize the tools and practice of lan-guage documentation.

We also seek collaboration with communities of language speakers. The corpus provides an econ-omy of scale for the development of literacy mate-rials and tools for interactive language instruction, in support of language preservation and revitaliza-tion. For small languages, literacy in the mother tongue is often defended on the grounds that it pro-vides the best route to literacy in the national lan-guage (Wagner, 1993, ch. 8). An essential ingredi-ent of any local literacy program is to have a sub-stantial quantity of available texts that represent familiar topics including cultural heritage, folk-lore, personal narratives, and current events. Tran-sition to literacy in a language of wider commu-nication is aided when transitional materials are available (Waters, 1998, pp. 61ff). Mutual bene-fits will also flow from the development of tools for low-cost publication and broadcast in the lan-guage, with copies of the published or broadcast material licensed to and archived in the corpus. 4.2 Roles The enterprise requires collaboration of many in-dividuals and groups, in a variety of roles. Editors. A critical group are people with suffi-cient engagement to serve as editors for particular language families, who have access to data or are able to negotiate redistribution rights, and oversee the workflow of transcription, translation, and an-notation. CL Research. All manual annotation steps need to be automated. Each step presents a challeng-ing semi-supervised learning and cross-linguistic bootstrapping problem. In addition, the overall measure of success X  X nduction of machine trans-lation systems from limited resources X  X ushes the state of the art (Kumar et al., 2007). Numerous other CL problems arise: active learning to im-prove the quality of alignments and bilingual lex-icons; automatic language identification for low-density languages; and morphology learning. Tool builders. We need tools for annotation, for-mat conversion, spidering and language identifica-tion, search, archiving, and presentation. Innova-tive crowd-sourcing solutions are of particular in-terest, e.g. web-based functionality for transcrib-ing audio and video of oral literature, or setting up a translation service based on aligned texts for a low-density language, and collecting the improved translations suggested by users.
 Volunteer annotators. An important reason for keeping the data model as lightweight as possible is to enable contributions from volunteers with lit-tle or no linguistic training. Two models are the volunteers who scan documents and correct OCR output in Project Gutenberg, or the undergraduate volunteers who have constructed Greek and Latin treebanks within Project Perseus (Crane, 2010). Bilingual lexicons that have been extracted from aligned text collections might be corrected using crowd-sourcing, leading to improved translation models and improved alignments. We also see the Universal Corpus as an excellent opportunity for undergraduates to participate in research, and for native speakers to participate in the preservation of their language.
 Documentary linguists. The collection proto-col known as Basic Oral Language Documentation (BOLD) enables documentary linguists to collect 2 X 3 orders of magnitude more oral discourse than before (Bird, 2010). Linguists can equip local speakers to collect written texts, then to carefully  X  X espeak X  and orally translate the texts into a refer-ence language. With suitable tools, incorporating active learning, local speakers could further curate bilingual texts and lexicons. An early need is pi-lot studies to determine costings for different cat-egories of language.
 Data agencies. The LDC and ELRA have a cen-tral role to play, given their track record in obtain-ing, curating, and publishing data with licenses that facilitate language technology development. We need to identify key resources where negoti-ation with the original data provider, and where payment of all preparation costs plus compensa-tion for lost revenue, leads to new material for the Corpus. This is a new publication model and a new business model, but it can co-exist with the existing models.
 Language archives. Language archives have a special role to play as holders of unique materi-als. They could contribute existing data in its na-tive format, for other participants to process. They could give bilingual texts a distinct status within their collections, to facilitate discovery. Funding agencies. To be successful, the Human Language Project would require substantial funds, possibly drawing on a constellation of public and private agencies in many countries. However, in the spirit of starting small, and starting now, agen-cies could require that sponsored projects which collect texts and build lexicons contribute them to the Language Commons. After all, the most effec-tive time to do translation, alignment, and lexicon work is often at the point when primary data is first collected, and this extra work promises direct benefits to the individual project. 4.3 Early tasks Seed corpus. The central challenge, we believe, is getting critical mass. Data attracts data, and if one can establish a sufficient seed, the effort will snowball. We can make some concrete proposals as to how to collect a seed. Language resources on the web are one source X  X he Cr  X  ubad  X  an project has identified resources for 400 languages, for ex-ample (Scannell, 2008); the New Testament of the Bible exists in about 1200 languages and contains of the order of 100k words. We hope that exist-ing efforts that are already well-disposed toward electronic distribution will participate. We partic-ularly mention the Language and Culture Archive of the Summer Institute of Linguistics, and the Rosetta Project. The latter is already distributed through the Internet Archive and contains material for 2500 languages.
 Resource discovery. Existing language re-sources need to be documented, a large un-dertaking that depends on widely distributed knowledge. Existing published corpora from the LDC, ELRA and dozens of other sources X  X  total of 85,000 items X  X re already documented in the combined catalog of the Open Language Archives Community, 3 so there is no need to recreate this information. Other resources can be logged by community members using a public access wiki, with a metadata template to ensure key fields are elicited such as resource owner, license, ISO 639 language code(s), and data type. This information can itself be curated and stored in the form of an OLAC archive, to permit search over the union of the existing and newly documented items. Work along these lines has already been initiated by LDC and ELRA (Cieri et al., 2010).
 Resource classification. Editors with knowl-edge of particular language families will catego-rize documented resources relative to the needs of the project, using controlled vocabularies. This involves examining a resource, determining the granularity and provenance of the segmentation and alignment, checking its ISO 639 classifi-cations, assigning it to a logarithmic size cate-gory, documenting its format and layout, collect-ing sample files, and assigning a priority score. Acquisition. Where necessary, permission will be sought to lodge the resource in the repository. Funding may be required to buy the rights to the resource from its owner, as compensation for lost revenue from future data sales. Funding may be required to translate the source into a reference language. The repository X  X  ingestion process is followed, and the resource metadata is updated. Text collection. Languages for which the avail-able resources are inadequate are identified, and the needs are prioritized, based on linguistic and geographical diversity. Sponsorship is sought for collecting bilingual texts in high priority lan-guages. Workflows are developed for languages based on a variety of factors, such as availability of educated people with native-level proficiency in their mother tongue and good knowledge of a reference language, internet access in the lan-guage area, availability of expatriate speakers in a first-world context, and so forth. A classification scheme is required to help predict which work-flows will be most successful in a given situation. Audio protocol. The challenge posed by lan-guages with no written literature should not be underestimated. A promising collection method is Basic Oral Language Documentation, which calls for inexpensive voice recorders and net-books, project-specific software for transcription and sentence-aligned translation, network band-width for upload to the repository, and suitable training and support throughout the process. Corpus readers. Software developers will in-spect the file formats and identify high priority for-mats based on information about resource priori-ties and sizes. They will code a corpus reader, an open source reference implementation for convert-ing between corpus formats and the storage model presented in section 3. 4.4 Further challenges There are many additional difficulties that could be listed, though we expect they can be addressed over time, once a sufficient seed corpus is estab-lished. Two particular issues deserve further com-ment, however.
 Licenses. Intellectual property issues surround-ing linguistic corpora present a complex and evolving landscape (DiPersio, 2010). For users, it would be ideal for all materials to be available un-der a single license that permits derivative works, commercial use, and redistribution, such as the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY). There would be no confusion about permissible uses of subsets and aggregates of the collected cor-pora, and it would be easy to view the Universal Corpus as a single corpus. But to attract as many data contributors as possible, we cannot make such a license a condition of contribution.

Instead, we propose to distinguish between: (1) a digital Archive of contributed corpora that are stored in their original format and made avail-able under a range of licenses, offering preserva-tion and dissemination services to the language resources community at large (i.e. the Language Commons); and (2) the Universal Corpus, which is embodied as programmatic access to an evolv-ing subset of materials from the archive under one of a small set of permissive licenses, licenses whose unions and intersections are understood (e.g. CC-BY and its non-commercial counterpart CC-BY-NC). Apart from being a useful service in its own right, the Archive would provide a staging ground for the Universal Corpus. Archived cor-pora having restrictive licenses could be evaluated for their potential as contributions to the Corpus, making it possible to prioritize the work of nego-tiating more liberal licenses.
 There are reasons to distinguish Archive and Corpus even beyond the license issues. The Cor-pus, but not the Archive, is limited to the formats that support automatic cross-linguistic processing. Conversely, since the primary interface to the Cor-pus is programmatic, it may include materials that are hosted in many different archives; it only needs to know how to access and deliver them to the user. Incidentally, we consider it an implementation is-sue whether the Corpus is provided as a web ser-vice, a download service with user-side software, user-side software with data delivered on physical media, or a cloud application with user programs executed server-side.
 Expenses of conversion and editing. We do not trivialize the work involved in converting docu-ments to the formats of section 3, and in manu-ally correcting the results of noisy automatic pro-cesses such as optical character recognition. In-deed, the amount of work involved is one moti-vation for the lengths to which we have gone to keep the data format simple. For example, we have deliberately avoided specifying any particular to-kenization scheme. Variation will arise as a con-sequence, but we believe that it will be no worse than the variability in input that current machine translation training methods routinely deal with, and will not greatly injure the utility of the Corpus. The utter simplicity of the formats also widens the pool of potential volunteers for doing the manual work that is required. By avoiding linguistically delicate annotation, we can take advantage of mo-tivated but untrained volunteers such as students and members of speaker communities. Nearly twenty years ago, the linguistics commu-nity received a wake-up call, when Hale et al. (1992) predicted that 90% of the world X  X  linguis-tic diversity would be lost or moribund by the year 2100, and warned that linguistics might  X  X o down in history as the only science that presided oblivi-ously over the disappearance of 90 per cent of the very field to which it is dedicated. X  Today, lan-guage documentation is a high priority in main-stream linguistics. However, the field of computa-tional linguistics is yet to participate substantially.
The first half century of research in compu-tational linguistics X  X rom circa 1960 up to the present X  X as touched on less than 1% of the world X  X  languages. For a field which is justly proud of its empirical methods, it is time to apply those methods to the remaining 99% of languages. We will never have the luxury of richly annotated data for these languages, so we are forced to ask ourselves: can we do more with less?
We believe the answer is  X  X es, X  and so we chal-lenge the computational linguistics community to adopt a scalable computational approach to the problem. We need leaner methods for building machine translation systems; new algorithms for cross-linguistic bootstrapping via multiple paths; more effective techniques for leveraging human effort in labeling data; scalable ways to get bilin-gual text for unwritten languages; and large scale social engineering to make it all happen quickly.
To believe we can build this Universal Corpus is certainly audacious, but not to even try is arguably irresponsible. The initial step parallels earlier ef-forts to create large machine-readable text collec-tions which began in the 1960s and reverberated through each subsequent decade. Collecting bilin-gual texts is an orthodox activity, and many alter-native conceptions of a Human Language Project would likely include this as an early task.
The undertaking ranks with the largest data-collection efforts in science today. It is not achiev-able without considerable computational sophis-tication and the full engagement of the field of computational linguistics. Yet we require no fun-damentally new technologies. We can build on our strengths in corpus-based methods, linguis-tic models, human-and machine-supplied annota-tions, and learning algorithms. By rising to this, the greatest language challenge of our time, we enable multi-lingual technology development at a new scale, and simultaneously lay the foundations for a new science of empirical universal linguis-tics.
