 1. Introduction The link-structure of the Web has been the focus in Web information retrieval research ove r the last few years. In particular, many novel algorithms for performing Web search and retrieval based on link-structure analysis were proposed (e.g. HITS (Kleinberg 1999) and the ensuing CLEVER project (Chakrabarti et al. 1999a, 1999b, 1998b, 1998a), P ag eR-ank (Brin and Page 1998, Haveliwala 2002), SALSA (Lempel and Moran 2001b)). These algorithms demonstrated empirically that link-structure analysis can improve search and rank techniques on the Web (Amento et al. 2000, Silva et al. 2000). Accordingly, search engines (such as Google 1 and AltaVista 2 )n ow adays incorporate extensive link analysis in 246 LEMPEL AND MORAN their ranking algorithms, that determine the order in which the search results are displayed to the user (Brin and Page 1998, Arasu et al. 2001).

The demonstrated improvements in precision that link-analyzing approaches achieved on the Web have prompted a more rigorous investigation of the theoretical properties of those 2001, Azar et al. 2001, Achlioptas et al. 2001, Borodin et al. 2001, Chien et al. 2002, Lee 2002). This paper focuses on two properties: rank-stability and rank-similarity, which are described next. 1.1. Stability and rank stability ranking algorithms are no exception. Loosely speaking, an algorithm is stable when small perturbations of its input do not dramatically alter its output X  X n the IR case, the set of retrieved results and their scores. The Web X  X  graph (the pages and their interconnecting hyperlinks) changes constantly as pages are added, deleted and modified. Important, au-be able to consistently identify them even as the underlying graph of the Web evolves.
W eb-IR algorithms must cope with more than the natural evolution of the Web. With the growing phenomenon of search engine spamming (Marchiori 1997, Dwork et al. 2001, Henzinger et al. 2002), the algorithms should remain focussed on the true high quality Web pages while malicious and adversarial attempts are made to bias their output. In the context of this work, we are especially concerned with the proliferation of link spamming (Lempel and Moran 2001b, Davison 2000). Link spammers are Web authors that create pages and interconnecting links with the intention of biasing search engine link-based rankings of pages, rather than for delivering content or facilitating human browsing. Link spammers, however, control just a small portion of Web pages and so cannot alter the Web X  X  graph in a radical or global fashion. They only introduce local noise into the graph, and so link-based algorithms should be able to withstand link spamming to some extent.

To the best of our knowledge, all of the link-based ranking algorithms proposed so far operate by first assigning numerical scores to Web pages, and then ranking the pages by The issue of stability was looked upon from three angles, which differ with respect to the graphs on which stability was examined.

One approach, which is applied in two related works X (Azar et al. 2001) and (Achlioptas et al. 2001) X  X ssumes that the Web X  X  structure obeys some topic-driven stochastic models. structure. In Achlioptas et al. (2001), a broader model of the Web was presented, modeling of each page to each topic. Under this broad model, the authors devised a query-driven RANK-STABILITY AND RANK-SIMILARITY OF LINK-BASED WEB RANKING 247 close to a constant vector (per query).

Ng et al. (2001) examined the effect of small changes in the analyzed graph on the score v ectors of PageRank, HITS, and Subspace HITS (a variation of HITS presented there). For P ageRank, they studied the L 1 -change to the scores when modifying the outgoing links of of (1) the number of links added/deleted, (2) the maximal out-degree of any page, and (3) the eigengap of the co-citation matrix of the graph. Lee (2002) argued that an algorithm is stable if the L 1 change in its score vector following perturbations is bounded by a linear P ageRank and Randomized HITS are stable for all graphs, SALSA is stable on authority-connected graphs, and HITS is not stable on authority-connected graphs (and hence is not stable on general graphs). Neither of these works examined how the perturbations affect the rankings that are induced by the score vectors. That aspect was looked upon by Chien et al. (2002), where it was shown that when a link is added to a graph, (1) the PageRank of the node receiving the link rises, and (2) the same node X  X  rank cannot decrease with respect to its rank prior to the change.

This paper follows the approach introduced by Borodin et al. (2001), which examined how perturbations of the input graphs affect the output of the algorithms under a worst-case analysis. They considered arbitrary Web graphs (that do not adhere to any particular model or conditions), and examined whether it is possible to find instances on which al-gorithms are unstable. They also introduced the notion of r ank stability , which measures the volatility of the rankings induced by the (assigned scores of the) algorithms. They ap-plied the definitions to many algorithms, and attained many (mostly negative, instability) results.

In Ng et al. (2001), Borodin et al. (2001) and Lee (2002) it was noted that the stability of some algorithms may depend on whether the graph being analyzed is authority connected  X  a concept that was introduced in Borodin et al. (2001) and will be formally defined in Section 3. The authors of Borodin et al. (2001) raise the question whether their negative results remain true when the discussion is limited to authority connected graphs. 1.2. Rank similarity As noted earlier, many link-based ranking algorithms were proposed over the last few years. This variety of algorithms raises several practical questions: are the results of different ranking algorithms substantially different on some (or on most) input graphs? Are some algorithms clearly more effective than others? Is it possible to characterize cases where algorithms outperform each other, or at least disagree with each other?
Due to the lack of an agreed-upon theoretical framework or experimental testbed, the effectiveness of algorithms was usually demonstrated by comparing the outputs of several algorithms on several queries (e.g., Bharat and Henzinger (1998), Chakrabarti et al. (2001) and Borodin et al. (2001)). As a by-product of such comparisons, it was noted that different 248 LEMPEL AND MORAN algorithms often rank different pages as the top resources for the same query. In contrast, when Amento et al. (2000) compared HITS, PageRank and ranking by In-degree on several carefully constructed Web subgraphs, the three schemes produced very similar rankings. This unexpected similarity was due, according to the authors, to the manner in which the e xamined Web graphs were assembled.

Analytical and experimental evidence that HITS and SALSA may produce inherently different rankings was shown in the context of the TKC (Tightly-Knit Community) Effect ((Lempel and Moran 2001b), see also Section 3.3). There, an infinite set of graph instances on which the rankings of HITS and SALSA strongly disagree was constructed. Furthermore, real Web subgraphs on which the two algorithms produced disagreeing rankings due to this effect, were reported.
 algorithms, also defined the notions of similar and r ank similar algorithms. These notions under a worst-case approach. Again, when applying these definitions to pairs of algorithms, most of their attained results were of negative nature (non-similarity). 1.3. This work We e xtend the results of Borodin et al. (2001) by proving that HITS is not rank-stable on the class of authority-connected graphs. A similar result is shown for PageRank, which was not analyzed in Borodin et al. (2001). We then show that HITS and PageRank are not rank similar on this class, nor is any of them rank similar to SALSA.
 This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the ranking algorithms P ageRank, HITS and SALSA. Section 3 brings the definitions of rank-stability and rank-notions. Section 4 details our extension of those results, and discusses the significance of these extensions. Section 5 brings our conclusions and ideas for future research. 2. Link-based ranking algorithms for Web pages This section provides a brief overview of three link based ranking algorithms: PageRank (Brin and Page 1998), HITS (Kleinberg 1999) and SALSA (Lempel and Moran 2001b). We first bring an overview on the three algorithms and the differences between them. Then, we technically describe how each of the algorithms ranks the pages ( = nodes) of a directed graph G = ( V , E ) where | V |= N .

P ageRank defines a random walk with random jumps over the (entire) Web graph. The states of the random walk are Web pages, and the score of each page is defined as its value score of a page can be interpreted as a global , topic-independent importance rating of that page.

HITS and SALSA, on the other hand, are topic-specific, local ranking algorithms: they operate on a small portion of the Web where resources pertaining to a specific topic are likely to exist, by analyzing the link structure of that Web subgraph and assigning hub RANK-STABILITY AND RANK-SIMILARITY OF LINK-BASED WEB RANKING 249 the authority scores produced by the two algorithms; HITS defines the authority score of each page to be the corresponding value in the normalized principal eigenvector of the input graph X  X  co-citation matrix. SALSA combines aspects from both HITS and PageR-ank, and performs a certain random walk which converges to the authority scores of the pages 3 . More on the relation between HITS and SALSA can be found in Borodin et al. (2001). 2.1. PageRank P ageRank (Brin and Page 1998) is an important part of the ranking function of the Google search engine. The PageRank of a page p (denoted PR ( p )) is the probability of visiting p in a random walk of the entire Web, where the set of states of the random walk is the set of pages, and each random step is of one of two types: 1. Choose a Web page uniformly at random, and jump to it. 2. From the given state s , choose uniformly at random an outgoing link of s and follow The first type of state transitions, the jumps to random Web pages, is needed since the Markov chain which is implied by the link-structure of the Web is separable rather than incorporating random jumps introduces a (small) probability of transition from any page a to any page b ,e ve ni n absence of a Web link a  X  b , thus giving rise to an ergodic Markov chain.

P ageRank chooses a parameter d , 0 &lt; d &lt; 1, and each state transition is of the first P ageRanks obey the following formula: Thus, the PageRank of a page grows with the importance ( = P ageRanks) of the pages which point to it. Since the random walk was defined on the entire Web, PageRank is a global , topic independent measure of each page X  X  information content. 2.2. Kleinberg X  X  hyperlink-induced topic search (HITS) HITS assigns each page s  X  V a pair of weights, a hub-weight h ( s ) and an authority weight a ( s ), based on the following two principles: 250 LEMPEL AND MORAN  X  The quality of a hub is determined by the quality of the authorities it points at.  X  The quality of an authority is determined by the quality of the hubs which link to it. T echnically, the weights are initialized to 1, and are updated by repeating the following three operations until convergence: 2. Update the hub weight of each page s (the O operation): 3. Normalize the authority weights and the hub weights.
 G .P ages are ranked according to their authority weights, which converge to the coordinates of the normalized principal eigenvector 5 of W T G W G . 2.3. SALSA SALSA, the Stochastic Approach for Link Structure Analysis, also assigns separate hub and authority scores to each page. These scores are based on two random walks performed on G , the authority walk and the hub walk .W e describe here the authority walk. Intuition suggests that authoritative pages should be visible (linked) from many pages G . Thus, a random walk on this subgraph will visit those pages with high probability. Formally, the links of q i (again, randomly and uniformly). Thus, the transition involves traversing two We b links, the first of which is traversed backwards (from destination to source) and the second is traversed forwards. Let  X  denote the stationary distribution of the random walk described above, when the initial distribution is uniform over all states. The score of each Lempel and Moran (2001b) that on authority connected graphs,  X  v is directly proportional to the in-degree of v in G . 3. Definitions, notations and known results Let G = ( V , E )b ea directed graph representing a set of Web-pages and their interconnect-ing links. We now define the terms rank-similarity and rank-stability of link-based ranking algorithms for the Web, and the concept of authority-connected graphs (Borodin et al. 2001). (2001).
 RANK-STABILITY AND RANK-SIMILARITY OF LINK-BASED WEB RANKING 251 3.1. Rank-stability and rank-similarity v and v 2 is defined as follows: Fo re xample, sion of the K endall tau distance between two rankings on the same set of objects (Diaconis 1988, Dwork et al. 2001).

In what follows, G denotes a set of directed graphs, and G N is the subset of N -node graphs in
G . Let A 1 , 2) induce rankings on the nodes of G .
 Definition 2 .T wo ranking algorithms A 1 and A 2 are r ank-similar on G if 6 Intuitively, when two algorithms are found to be rank-similar, they should no longer be compared with each other in terms of search quality, but rather in terms of runtime per-formance (or ease of implementation). The more complex algorithm of the two usually becomes redundant.
 Definition 3 .A n algorithm A is r ank stable on G if for every fixed k ,wehave where d e ( G 1 , G 2 ) =| ( E 1  X  E 2 ) \ ( E 1  X  E 2 ) | .
 Whereas in Definition 2 we compare the rankings induced by two different algorithms on the nodes of the same graph, Definition 3 fixes the algorithm and compares the rankings it induces on the nodes of a pair of graphs that differ in at most k edges.
 corresponding ideas can be developed and studied in the context of classic IR as well. For 252 LEMPEL AND MORAN e xample, fixing a corpus and a query, one can compare the document rankings induced by different similarity measures and retrieval models. 3.2. Authority-connected graphs: Definition and motivation Let G = ( V , E )b ea directed graph (representing some Web-subgraph). Two nodes p , q  X  V are co-cited if there exists a node r that links to both p and q .W e say that p and q are ( v incoming edge.
 V in , there exists a co-citation path connecting p and q .
 graphs.

One of the most basic premises of link analysis is that a co-citation of two pages implies a topical connection between them. Thus, when two pages (with at least one incoming link) are connected by a co-citation path, there is a  X  X emantic line of thought X  that leads from authority-connected components of a graph conceptually correspond to neighborhoods of pages that pertain to different topics or concepts: not a single page links to pages of two By examining rankings on authority connected graphs, we ensure that the relevance of all pages will be measured with respect to the same bar. For more on the significance of such graphs, see Section 4.1. 3.3. Known results The following were shown in Borodin et al. (2001): (1) HITS is not rank-stable on  X  G , (2) rank-stable and L 1 -stable on authority-connected graphs.

The instability and non-similarity results were shown on graphs with two disjoint compo-nents. Such graphs, which are obviously not authority connected, conceptually correspond to collections of Web pages that pertain to multiple, unrelated topics. For the instability results, the small perturbations considered in the proofs caused HITS and SALSA to shift their preference from the pages of one component to those of the other. The non-similarity result involved proving that HITS and SALSA prefer pages of different components. The remain true when the discussion is limited to authority connected graphs. We answer this affirmatively in Section 4.
 RANK-STABILITY AND RANK-SIMILARITY OF LINK-BASED WEB RANKING 253 3.3.2. The Tightly-Knit Community (TKC) effect. The TKC effect highlights an impor-tant difference between HITS and SALSA: HITS favors groups of pages that have many  X  X nternal X  co-citations, while SALSA prefers pages with many inlinks. A tightly-knit com-munity is a small but highly interconnected set of pages. Roughly speaking, the TKC effect occurs when such a community scores high in link-analyzing algorithms, even though its pages are not authoritative on the topic, or pertain to just one aspect of the topic. It was shown in Lempel and Moran (2001b), both theoretically and experimentally, that HITS is more sensitive than SALSA to this effect. The theoretical analysis involved the construction of authority-connected graphs containing both a small tightly knit community (with many interconnecting hubs) and a large, less densely connected community. It was proven that HITS ranks the authorities of the small, tightly knit community higher than it ranks the authorities of the larger community, while SALSA prefers the authorities of the larger community. The demonstrated qualitative difference between the two algorithms, however, does not prove that the algorithms are not rank similar under the definition given in the previous subsection: the ranking distance d r demonstrated by the constructed graphs is link) grows. The experimental part in Lempel and Moran (2001b) involved the collection of several real-life Web graph, on which HITS and SALSA gave different results. It was shown there that the rankings of HITS were biased towards the pages of tightly-knit communities. 4. Results Our work focuses on the class of authority connected graphs, which we denote by G AC . Section 4.2 shows that neither HITS nor PageRank is rank stable on G AC . Thus, SALSA is the only algorithm of the three algorithms we consider here that is rank stable on G AC . Furthermore, we show there that no pair of these algorithms is rank similar on G AC . The results concerning HITS and SALSA complement the knowledge on general graphs (Sec-tion 3.3); PageRank was not previously examined in this context. Before diving into the mathematical details of the proofs, Section 4.1 discusses the significance of our results. 4.1. Significance of results 4.1.1. Focusing on authority-connected graphs. As detailed in Section 3, today X  X  pre-v ailing link analysis algorithms rank Web pages according to the entries of the principal eigenvector of some matrix representation of the corresponding web graphs. Accordingly, the algorithms differ only in the manner in which these matrices are constructed. Specifi-cally, PageRank uses a stochastic version of the adjacency matrix of the Web, HITS uses the co-citation matrix, and SALSA uses a stochastic version of the co-citation matrix of the corresponding graph. It is possible to identify two extreme approaches in papers studying properties of the rankings induced by these algorithms: 7 one approach, used for proving positive results, assumes that the Web X  X  structure, and hence the resulting matrices, obey certain regular, well behaved stochastic properties (e.g., Azar et al. (2001) and Achlioptas et al. (2001)). The other approach, used in Borodin et al. (2001) when proving negative 254 LEMPEL AND MORAN results, considers Web graphs X  X nd hence, matrices X  X f arbitrary structure. This paper at-tempts to narrow the gap between these approaches by restricting the worst case analysis of Borodin et al. (2001) to a class of well behaved graphs X  X he authority connected graphs, which are exactly those graphs whose co-citation matrices are irreducible. 8
Informally, authority-connected graphs represent a natural testbed for examining theo-at least one inlink) are connected by a co-citation path, and thus are thematically related. Furthermore, from a technical point of view, it can be argued that studying the scores and rankings of HITS on authority-disconnected graphs, is of limited interest. Perron-Frobenius theory (Gallager 1996, Horn and Johnson 1985) implies that HITS will assign positive scores to all authorities in authority-connected graphs. However, when the graph contains distinct authority-connected components, HITS will assign zero scores to the pages in all but one of these components. 9 This means that any perturbation which disconnects a component or merges distinct components will cause significant changes in the induced scores and rank-ings. Indeed, the rank-instability/nonsimilarity for HITS and SALSA on general graphs in Borodin et al. (2001) involved such perturbations.
 been noted before. PageRank was purposely defined in a manner which guarantees that the resulting stochastic matrix is irreducible, by incorporating random jumps into the random w alk over the Web X  X  graph (Brin and Page 1998). As the underlying graph of the Web is not strongly connected (Broder et al. 2000), had PageRank X  X  random walk been limited to traversing Web links alone, it would not have been ergodic (Gallager 1996). The addition of random jumps effectively links every page to all other pages, implying strong connectivity, and in turn, ergodicity. Several proposed variations of HITS avoided the singularities of modified versions of the co-citation matrix. Randomized HITS, for example, incorporated random jumps (in the spirit of PageRank) into HITS. These jumps essentially transform HITS X  scores (Ng et al. 2001, Lee 2002). Farahat et al. (2001) used exponentiated input to HITS in order to transform every weakly connected Web graph into an authority-connected graph. 4.1.2. Revisiting the definition of the ranking distance. The definitions of rank stability clear, however, that the ranking distance d r is an appropriate measure of the difference of two rankings. The current definition is unweighted: any time the two compared rankings argue that on the Web, rank changes at the top of the rankings should count much more than rank changes closer to the bottom: for many queries on search engines, many thousands any change in the order of the bottom half of the rankings is inconsequential and will go unnoticed.

While alternative definitions of the ranking distance might better suit the problem of ranking Web pages, we argue that our results will stand under any reasonable definition. RANK-STABILITY AND RANK-SIMILARITY OF LINK-BASED WEB RANKING 255 In all of our results, the differences between the two compared rankings involve (at the Proposition 1), the two rankings are essentially opposites. Since any reasonable function will judge such extreme changes to the upper half of the rankings as different, our results are applicable to alternative definitions of the ranking distance. pages, has been studied more than the corresponding notion of rank-stability. In particular, there are positive results concerning stability where there are no results at all concerning rank-stability. For example, Lee (2002) showed that the PageRank algorithm produces stable scores: when the perturbation of the graph involves changing the outlinks of a single page p , the L 1 change in the score vector of PageRank is bounded by a linear function of the PageRank of p (prior to the change). An interesting question is whether stability one outlink of a very low ranking page essentially turns the entire rankings upside down. 4.2. Proofs of results This section provides the technical details of our rank-nonsimilarity and rank-instability when proving that an algorithm is not rank-stable, we construct infinitely many cases where Proposition 1. HITS is not rank stable on the class of authority connected graphs G AC . Proof: Consider the following graphs G 1 and G 2 ( G 2 is shown in figure 1). Both graphs h , h links:  X  h 0  X  a 1 , h n  X  a n .  X  X or all i = 1 ,..., n  X  1: h i  X  a i , h i  X  a i + 1 .
 Clearly, G 1 and G 2 are authority connected. The difference between the graphs is that in G 1 , both h and G 2 are isomorphic, where the unique isomorphism between them involves reversing the identities of the n authorities and of the n + 1fi xe d hubs.

Let x 1 ,..., x n denote the HITS authority weights of a 1 ,..., a n under G 2 . Recall that these weights are the entries of the principal eigenvector of the co-citation matrix of G 2 256 LEMPEL AND MORAN reversed and are in complete disagreement. Hence, proving the non-rank-stability of HITS on G AC .

By the definition of G 2 , the (irreducible) co-citation matrix of the n authorities is as follows:
Denote the principal eigenvalue of the matrix by  X  .B y the Perron-Frobenius theorem
The first line of the co-citation matrix implies the following equation on x 1 and x 2 : of the co-citation matrix, Therefore, x 1 &lt; x 2 &lt;  X  X  X  &lt; x n .

In Lempel and Moran (2001a) we use a construction similar to that of Proposition 1 a previous result concerning HITS X  L 1 -instability on general graphs from Borodin et al. (2001).
 RANK-STABILITY AND RANK-SIMILARITY OF LINK-BASED WEB RANKING 257 Proposition 2. P ag eRank is not rank stable on the class of authority connected graphs G Proof: Consider the following graph G = ( V , E ) (shown in figure 2):
Define G a = ( V , E  X  X  y  X  h a } ) , G b = ( V , E  X  X  y  X  h b } ). Both G a and G b are authority connected (through the connectivity of the vertex c ).
 definition of PageRank, it is easy to see that 1  X  i  X  n . Thus, and the result follows.
 Thus, the dramatic change in the rankings was caused by shifting the single outlink of y , which is a very low-ranking node. 258 LEMPEL AND MORAN Proposition 3. HITS , P ag eRank are not rank similar on the class of authority connected graphs.
 notation, we denote A ={ a 1 ,..., a n } and B ={ b 1 ,..., b n } .
 Thus, G 3 consists of N = 4 n + 2 nodes. It is easy to see that G 3 is authority-connected (through the connectivity of the node s ).

We e xamine the relative rankings of the A nodes and the B nodes. We first note that HITS rows that correspond to the A and B nodes in the co-citation matrix of G 3 , M G HITS X  authority weights of all A -nodes will be equal, and will be denoted by a . Likewise, the (all-equal) authority scores of the B -nodes will be denoted by b . The authority scores RANK-STABILITY AND RANK-SIMILARITY OF LINK-BASED WEB RANKING 259 M
G 3 . The rows in M G 3 that correspond to the A and B nodes give rise to the following two equations: Where T is the sum of the (positive) authority scores of the V \ ( A  X  B )-nodes. The first equation implies that  X &gt; 2 n . Subtracting (2) from (1), we have (for all n &gt; 2) Thus, HITS ranks the A -nodes higher than it ranks the B -nodes.
 As for PageRank, by arguments similar to those of Proposition 2, we have P ageRank prefers the B nodes over the A nodes. Thus, proving that the two algorithms are not rank similar.
 Proposition 4. HITS and SALSA are not rank similar on the class of authority connected graphs.
 Proof: Consider the graph G 3 defined in Proposition 3. Since G 3 is authority-connected, SALSA will rank the nodes by their in-degree. The in-degree of all a  X  A is 2 while the in-degree of each b  X  B is 3. Thus, SALSA (like PageRank) prefers the B -nodes over the A -nodes while HITS prefers the A -nodes over the B -nodes, and the result follows. Proposition 5. P ag eRank and SALSA are not rank similar on the class of authority con-nected graphs G AC .
 Proof: Let d be the random jump parameter of PageRank and let t = 4 3 + 2 1  X  d .For all n  X  t , consider the following graph G 5 = ( V , E ) (again, A ={ a 1 ,..., a n } , B = { b 260 LEMPEL AND MORAN G 5 contains N SALSA ranks the B -nodes higher than it ranks the A -nodes.

 5. Conclusions This work examined the notions of rank-stability and rank-similarity of link-based rank-ing algorithms on authority-connected graphs. Three specific algorithms were examined: P ageRank, HITS and SALSA. Previous work has already shown that SALSA is rank-stable on authority-connected graphs. In this paper it was shown that both PageRank and HITS are not rank-stable on authority-connected graphs, and that no pair of the three algorithms is rank-similar on such graphs.

As noted in the Introduction, rank-instability and rank-nonsimilarity are worst-case no-ank, HITS or SALSA on the  X  X ypical X  Web graph, they do provide theoretical insight on demonstrated experimentally in Lempel and Moran (2001b). This research should be com-plemented by the average-case analysis of these (and other) algorithms, coupled with the study of realistic models for the Web graph X  X n area of research which has seen much 2001, Kumar et al. 2000, Ruhl et al. 2001). Another issue of importance, under-explored the algorithms as their input is perturbed (see, for example, Dominich and Tuza (2003)). 262 LEMPEL AND MORAN Stability of running times is especially important in the context of link-analyses on graphs of Web scale, as these algorithms demand considerable computational resources. In terms of HITS and PageRank, studying running time stability translates to investigations of how the eigengaps of the respective matrices fluctuate as the Web graph undergoes minor changes. similarity of PageRank and SALSA on the real Web. It is well-known that the distribution of in-degrees of Web pages follows a power-law (Barabasi and Albert 1999, Kleinberg et al. of PageRank also follows a power-law. Furthermore, the exponent of both distributions is motivation behind PageRank and HITS was that in-degree is not a sufficient indication of a page X  X  authority or importance, the identical distributions of the in-degrees and PageRank suggest that ultimately, in-degree might be an effective approximation to PageRank. In the terms used in this paper, the ranking distance d r between PageRank and the in-degree measure (the fraction of pairs whose relative ranking is different between the two measures) could very well be small. Carrying this argument further, the ranking distance between SALSA and PageRank on real Web graphs 10 could also be small. We leave this for future e xperimental research.
