 1. Introduction
In many situations, it is necessary to release confidential data providing useful information like the data know that privacy protection measures are in place [1] .
 During the past few years, special efforts have been made to develop a wide range of protection methods.
Good surveys about data protection methods can be found in the literature [2,10] . Among all the proposed data protection methods, rank swapping is one of the most used, because it is very simple and has a low com-putational cost. The original proposal [7] , which worked better for tabular data, was extended to the scenario (ordered) rank. A good survey on rank swapping techniques can be found in [18] . We explain the method for microdata in more detail in Section 2.3 , along with a simple example.
The main goal of rank swapping, and in general of all protection methods, is to minimize both the disclo-sure risk (DR) and the information loss (IL) of the protected released microdata. Disclosure risk measures the capacity of an intruder to obtain some information about the original dataset from the protected one, and information loss measures the reduction of the statistical utility of the protected microdata with respect to the original one.

However, there is a trade off between these two parameters: when one of them decreases the other one increases. Finding the optimal combination of these two measures becomes a difficult and challenging task.
Moreover, in some situations, an organization could be interested in releasing the data by fixing a desirable level for one of the parameters. For these two reasons it becomes necessary to compute both measures in a very accurate manner to release the protected dataset ensuring an enough protection level and statistical utility.

Some approaches are used to calculate the information loss. In [9] the authors calculate the average differ-ence between some statistics computed on both the original and the protected microdata. A probabilistic var-iation of this measure was presented in [20] to ensure that the information loss value is always inside the interval [0,1]. A different approach was presented in [3] , where some measures ( accuracy , completeness and consistency ) are calculated over the protected data to evaluate the information loss.

In order to compute the disclosure risk, many works like [9,23,30] consider record linkage methods [24,28,29] . Such methods try to model the situation where an intruder sees the protected dataset, whereas he has access to some records of the original dataset obtained from other sources. The goal of the methods
Of course, the more records can be linked by means of these record linkage methods, the more disclosure risk has the employed protection method. Some examples of standard record linkage methods are distance based ones and probabilistic ones.

Other methods to evaluate the disclosure risk can be considered. In the recent work [27] , the authors define a framework for privacy protection where the intruder can only query the database by using propositional sentences. Therefore, if the database answers these questions with enough level of generalization, it is really hard for the intruder to infer any confidential information of a specific individual. The measure of disclosure risk in this scenario is the percentage of individuals for which an intruder is able to discover the value of a confidential attribute.

Normally, information loss and disclosure risk are combined to obtain a global value about a specific pro-tection method, this value weights the relationship between IL and DR. One approach was presented in [9] , where the authors combine both information loss and disclosure risk in a Score using the arithmetic mean. A between any numerical measure of statistical disclosure risk (R) and any numerical measure of data utility (U). Both measures, R and U, can be general or specific for a certain protection method.

Recently, some authors have been working on possible improvements to record linkage methods, in order to give better estimates of disclosure risk for specific protection methods. For example, [26] studies distance based record linkage for the IPSO protection methods [5] , a synthetic data generator based on multiple regres-sion models. The authors show that the disclosure risk increase when the Euclidean distance is replaced by the
Mahalanobis one. A similar result is obtained for microaggregation [11] , a protection method which builds ter where this record belongs. Ref. [25] shows that the disclosure risk of microaggregation increases when the
Euclidean distance is replaced by a specific one that takes into account the clusters. These two works, as well as the results that we present here for rank swapping, show that the design of protection methods should avoid ad hoc attacks.

In this paper, we describe a new record linkage method, specific for rank swapping. This method exploits the fact that only a few values of the dataset are eligible when doing rank swapping. Using this information, we can limit the records where the record linkage method must be applied, decreasing in this way the prob-ability of finding incorrect links. The result is an increase on the number of correct links, and therefore an increment in the disclosure risk of standard rank swapping.

Then, we propose two new protection methods, obtained as variants of rank swapping, which are called rank swapping p-distribution and rank swapping p-buckets and which are in some way immune to the effect of the new record linkage method. The main idea of these methods is that each attribute value can be poten-tially (maybe with very low probability, but never equal to 0) swapped with any other value. For this reason, lead to a higher number of incorrect linkages. Our empirical results show that the two new proposed protec-tion methods obtain a better score (the average of information loss and disclosure risk) than standard rank swapping, once the new record linkage method is taken into account.
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we explain some preliminaries needed later on.
We present in Section 3 a description of the new record linkage method, specific for rank swapping. In Section 4 we propose the two new variants of rank swapping. We present some experimental comparisons among rank swapping methods in Section 5 . In Section 6 we discuss about the real disclosure risk of the new variants of rank swapping. Finally, in Section 7 , we draw some conclusions and present some future work. 2. Preliminaries
In this section, we explain some basics about microdata protection methods, including the standard way of computing the score of such a method, by combining its information loss and its disclosure risk. Then, we give a description of the rank swapping protection method, which is illustrated with a toy example. 2.1. Microdata protection methods
A dataset X can be thought as a matrix with n rows ( records ) and k columns ( attributes ). Each row contains biguously identify the individual (for example, the passport number), or quasi-identifier otherwise (for exam-ple, the age). Note however that some combinations of quasi-identifier attributes can identify an individual, depending on the scenario. For example, the combination (age = 16, city = NY, job = photographer in the  X  X aily Bugle X ) univocally identifies Peter Parker, Spiderman. Quasi-identifier attributes can be divided in two classes: confidential and non-confidential , depending on whether they contain private information. For example, the zip code is non-confidential, whereas the salary can be a confidential attribute.
Normally, before releasing a dataset with confidential attributes, a protection method q is applied, leading either removed or encrypted, therefore we will write X = X tection methods, has also been adopted in other works [26,27] . 2.1.1. Record linkage
Once the modified dataset X 0 is released, everybody can see its content: X an intruder has access to some other original dataset Y = Y correctly link a record y nc 2 Y nc (which is also in X nc he will know that the matching (not modified) confidential information x tifier y id , breaking therefore the privacy of this individual.
 linkages between original and protected data. Two record linkage (also known as re-identification ) methods are usually considered in the literature:  X  Distance based record linkage ( DB-RL ). It can be applied when a distance between records in the original ginal record. When the data are numerical, one usually employs the Euclidean distance, after normalizing the whole dataset. This record linkage method was proposed in [22] .  X  Probabilistic record linkage ( P-RL ). In this case, the matching algorithm uses the linear sum assignment model to choose the original and protected records that must be matched, in order to compute this model,
EM (Expectation X  X aximization) algorithm is normally used. Formally, for each pair of records ( a , b ) where a is an original record of the original dataset X and b is a protected record of the protected dataset
X 0 , we define a coincidence vector c ( a , b )=( c 1 ( a , b ) ... c index, pairs are classified as either a linked pair (LP) or a non-linked pair (NP). This method was intro-duced in [19] . 2.2. Score: Information loss and disclosure risk
Among the different measures explained in the Introduction to evaluate the quality of a data protection method, we will use the score . This approach, first presented in [9] and used in many other works [23,30] , is a simple and natural way to evaluate the trade-off between the information loss and the disclosure risk.
Besides, it allows us to compare easily our new rank swapping methods with all protection methods evaluated in [10] . In particular, standard rank swapping.

As stated, the score takes into account two different contradictory aspects, the disclosure risk (DR), that is the risk that an intruder obtains any correct relation between the protected and the original data, and the information loss (IL) produced in the protected microdata. It is important to note that IL and DR are inversely maximum; (ii) if the original microdata are encrypted and then released, the disclosure risk is (almost) zero, but the information loss is maximum.

Formally, the score for a given method is defined by That is, the average of the information loss and the disclosure risk.

There are different possible ways to measure IL and DR. We have mainly used the expressions in [10] for the sake of comparability with previous results. Nevertheless, it is worth mention that such measures are generic in the sense that they are not specific to a particular protection method or a particular data use.
Specific ones might also be considered. We will consider this case in Section 3 in what concerns disclosure risk.

Formally, IL and DR are computed as follows.  X  Information loss. The overall IL is computed as IL = 100(0.2 IL where (i) IL 1 : It is the mean absolute error of the original microdata X vs. the protected data X (ii) IL 2 : Let X and X 0 be the vectors of averages of attributes (rows) in X and X (iii) IL 3 : Let V and V 0 be the covariance matrices of X and X (iv) IL 4 : Let S and S 0 be the vectors of variances of attributes (rows) in X and X (v) IL 5 : Let R and R 0 be the correlation matrices of X and X ations of record linkage and the interval disclosure. Again, as in the case of information loss, other approaches might be considered here. Record linkage presents the advantage that it is a unified approach considering the risk with multiple databases. So, it permits to model different scenarios. Interval disclosure is an alternative approach where disclosure does not mean  X  X inding the correct link X  but  X  X btaining an we define the measure of the risk giving half weight to record linkage and half weight to interval disclosure. Then, for record linkage we consider the average of different alternatives. Formally, this corresponds to
DR = 0.25  X  DLD + 0.25  X  PLD + 0.5  X  ID , where 2.3. Rank swapping
Rank swapping is a widely used microdata protection method, which was originally described only for ordi-nal attributes in [21] . However, in the comparisons made in [10] , rank swapping was ranked among the best microdata protection methods for numerical attributes.

Rank swapping with parameter p and with respect to an attribute attr ginal dataset X ) can be defined as follows: first, the records of X are sorted in increasing order of the val-x ij 6 x  X  j for all 1 6 i &lt;  X  6 n . Then, each value x ij formly chosen in the set of still unswapped values in the limited range i &lt;  X  6 i + p . Finally, the sorting step is undone.

Usually, when rank swapping is applied to a dataset, the algorithm explained above is run for each attribute to be protected, in a sequential way. The parameter p is used to control the swap range. Normally, p is defined as a percent of the total number n of records in X . Therefore, when p increases the difference between x x  X  j may increase. This fact makes record linkage more difficult, but of course the information loss of the pro-tected data is higher, decreasing in this way its statistical utility. rank swapping with p = 2. The protected microdata is shown in the right side of the same table. For the sake to these datasets the measures described in Section 2.2 is shown in Table 2 . 3. A new record linkage method for rank swapping
As we stated in Section 2 , only standard generic measures, like distance based or probabilistic record link-age, are considered when the disclosure risk of a protection method is computed. The use of these generic mea-sures causes an underestimation of the resulting disclosure risk.

We consider here a specific method for rank swapping. We will call this method rank swapping record link-age (RS-RL for short). The idea is quite easy to understand: standard rank swapping swaps one original value with one of the p following values in the sorted table. Therefore, if the protected values of the attribute are known, as in our scenario, it is possible to limit the protected records into which a specific original record can have been transformed. One must compare the original record x in the protected microdata file (note that a protected value can be either the source or the destination in the swap process). In other words, for every original value x protected records which may be the result of transforming the original record x
Obviously, if more than one attribute is known, it is possible to repeat the process for each attribute. If the original record x i =( x i 1 , ... , x ic ) to be linked has c attributes attr record x 0  X  will necessarily satisfy the condition
That is, the search of the linkage is reduced to the intersection of the sets of possible protected records. Of course, the more attributes are considered, the less records will be in this intersection, and therefore the ular, if some intersection (for some combination of the protected attributes) gives a unique possible record, we can be sure that this is the protected record which matches with the considered original record, because this linkage method does not introduce error probabilities. This is in contrast to the standard record linkage methods, where an original record is compared to all the protected records, possibly leading to incorrect linkages.

Example 2. Let us illustrate this fact throughout the example showed in Table 1 . Consider the standard distance based record linkage method (with the Euclidean distance) applied to the original record (6,7,10,2).
The distances between this record and all the protected records are computed, the closest protected record is (6,7,6,3), which is not the matching one. Therefore, this method leads to an incorrect linkage (6,7,10,2) M (6,7,6,3). On the other hand, consider the new specific technique applied to the same record (6,7,10,2). The set of possible protected values consistent with a 6 in the first original attribute is butes, we obtain B ( attr 2 = 7) = {(5,5,8,1), (2,6,9,8), (6,7,6,3), (1,8,7,9), (3,9,1,7)}, B ( attr as the intersection of the four sets is just the protected record (5,5,8,1), in this case we obtain the correct original record would have been chosen.

Note also that this new method has been defined assuming that the value of the parameter p is known. In situations where this value is kept secret by the owner of the original dataset, then the method can be applied by first fixing an upper bound for the value of p (for example, the 20% of the number of entries of the data-base). Of course, the results of the method are optimal when the exact value of p is used. This assumption is quite realistic, for example, all available microdata files in the EUROSTAT web page [17] include a full description of the anonymization criteria that has been applied.

In Table 3 , we show the number of correctly linked records with the three considered record linkage meth-record linkage process uses only the known attributes to compute the nearest record. From the comparison between the average disclosure risk using the new method and the DB-RL and P-RL showed in Table 2 ,it is clear that the real disclosure risk is much larger than the standard one.

If we compute the score by using only the new record linkage method for the disclosure risk measure, then the new score in the example is equal to 41.44. If the disclosure risk is computed by combining the standard and the new record linkage methods, then the score is equal to 33.31.

As a final note we want to remark that although the method introduced here seems to be quite intuitive, it dard record linkage methods and no attention is given to specific ones. Nevertheless, as an intruder might exploit any weakness in a protection method, the development and study of these methods is of interest to make methods as effective as possible. 4. New rank swapping methods
In this section, we present two new variants of rank swapping which resist the new record linkage method closed. 4.1. Rank swapping p-distribution
As we have explained in Section 2 the swap interval in the rank swapping is defined by the parameter p , this
For this reason, rank swapping p -distribution defines the swap interval using a normal probability distribu-tion, defined by l = r = 0.5  X  p .

This modification makes possible that any value in the dataset could be selected, obviously very distinct x open interval. When this effect is propagated to all protected attributes, the RS-RL method becomes unsuit-able. In the experiments presented in the next section we will show that the number of correct links obtained by an intruder decreases when more attributes are known.

Rank swapping p -distribution applied to an attribute attr follows: first, the table (microdata file) is sorted in increasing order of the values x attr j . For simplicity, assume that the records are already sorted, that is x x and x  X  j are swapped, where  X  = i + r . Finally, the sorting step is undone.

The negative effect produced by the swapping between two far values is that the information loss of the protected files increases. We will show in Section 5 that the increment of information loss is compensated dard rank swapping.
 In Section 6 we present a possible specific record linkage for this new rank swapping p -distribution method.
The experiments show that the performance of this specific record linkage is similar to distance based record linkage.

In the rest of this paper, we will use rs a -d to denote the application of rank swapping p -distribution with p = a .
 4.2. Rank swapping p-buckets
The rank swapping p -buckets method pursues the same goal than rank swapping p -distribution. For this reason it also substitutes the close swap interval of the rank swapping with an unlimited interval, but using now a different technique.

The idea of this method is to split the sorted original values of an attribute in several buckets. First, a probability function is used to choose a bucket for each value. Once the bucket is selected, the method works identically to the standard rank swapping, by using this bucket as the closed swap interval. Again, every original record will have some non-zero probability of being the correct link of every protected record.
For this reason, the RS-RL method will be less effective here than when it is applied to the standard rank swapping.

Rank swapping p -bucket applied to an attribute attr j of an original microdata file X can be defined as fol-lows: first, the table is sorted in increasing order of the values x ity, assume that the records are already sorted, that is x { x ij j 1 6 i 6 n } are split into p buckets B 1 , ... , B p
B s is chosen, according to the probability distribution
Then, a value x  X  j is randomly and uniformly chosen in the selected bucket B swapped. Note that, if the same bucket B s = B r is chosen, the condition  X  &gt; i must be imposed.
Intuitively, closer buckets to the original value are selected with higher probability than the far-off buckets and, therefore, the information loss of the protected microdata file is under control. Note that many other probability distributions could be used to define similar variants of rank swapping.

In the rest of the paper, rs a -b will be used to denote a rank swapping p -bucket with p = a . 5. Experiments
As stated above, we have introduced the two variants of rank swapping to mitigate the effect of the specific record linkage method RS-RL. Of course, this is at the cost of increasing information loss, because some val-ues may be swapped with values which are quite far. Our feeling was that this increment of the information better general scores than standard rank swapping. Experiments described in this section confirm our feelings.
In short, the section describes the analysis of disclosure risk using our specific record linkage method and the comparison of the new rank swapping methods against standard ones. We start reviewing the data files used in the experiments. 5.1. Data In our experiments, we have considered the two reference microdata files proposed in the CASC project [4] . The first one, called Census, has been extracted using the Data Extraction System (DES) from the US Census
Bureau [8] . This dataset contains 1080 records consisting of 13 attributes (i.e., 14040 values are to be pro-tected). The second one, called EIA, was extracted from the U.S. Energy Information Authority [16] . It con-tains 4092 records consisting of 10 attributes (i.e., 40920 values to be protected). 5.2. Disclosure risk analysis for rank swapping
In order to evaluate the specific record linkage method (RS-RL) introduced in Section 3 , we have protected the Census and EIA datasets by using different parameterizations of standard rank swapping ( p =2 ... 20), rank swapping p -distribution ( p =2 ... 20) and rank swapping p -buckets ( p = 75, 50, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15,10, 5). For each protected dataset, we have computed its disclosure risk using RS-RL. At this point, in order to study the worst case scenario, the parameter p is assumed to be known.
It is clear that the rank swapping p -distribution and the rank swapping p -buckets have an advantage with respect to standard rank swapping when RS-RL is used. For this reason, disclosure risk measures have been computed using a larger parameter. In particular, we used 2  X  p for the rank swapping p -distribution, and p =2  X  Bucket Size for the rank swapping p -buckets. For standard rank swapping, the parameter p was used.

Fig. 3 shows, in a graphic way, the number of correct links that RS-RL obtains, when applied to standard rank swapping, for both datasets, when different numbers of attributes are assumed to be known by the intru-that the more attributes are known by the intruder, the more records are linked. Figures also show that for the five less protected datasets from Census, an intruder links more than 70% of the records when only half of the attributes are known. Another interesting result with the Census dataset is that the intruder is always able to most suitable method.
 link more than 50% of records when all the attributes are known. In EIA, the results of our specific record linkage are not so good because (i) the EIA dataset has four times more records than Census dataset, (ii) the EIA dataset has less attributes than Census.
 Fig. 4 presents the results of RS-RL applied to the files protected using rank swapping p -distribution.
Detailed results are given in Appendix A . The chart lines show that an intruder can make no use of knowing all the attributes when data is protected using rank swapping p -distribution. Therefore, the rank swapping record linkage becomes unsuitable now. This is so, because when the intruder knows many attributes, he is forced to consider all the records, and not a small subset, to take advantage of his knowledge. For the Census dataset, only in the less protected parameterization ( p = 2) the intruder is able to link more than 50% of the records, and this happens when he knows three or four attributes: the knowledge of more attributes is not useful in this case. The rest of the cases are protected enough to avoid a large number of correct linkages for both the Census and EIA datasets.

The results obtained for rank swapping p -buckets, which are shown in Fig. 5 and detailed in Appendix A , intruder is able to link more than 50% of the records, the remainder configurations are protected enough to avoid a large number of correct linkages. As it happens with the rank swapping p -distribution, the knowledge of all attributes is not useful for an intruder when using rank swapping record linkage. 5.3. New rank swapping methods vs. standard rank swapping
In this section, we compare the overall behavior of the new methods with the standard one. We study the effects of the introduced modifications in information loss and standard disclosure risk measures.
The comparison is based on the score defined in Section 2.2 . We have modified the score so that the dis-closure risk measure takes into account the new rank swapping record linkage. Formally, we use the following disclosure risk measure DR = 0.166  X  RSLD + 0.166  X  DLD + 0.166  X  PLD + 0.5  X  ID instead of DR = 0.25  X 
DLD + 0.25  X  PLD + 0.5  X  ID . Here, RSLD stands for Rank Swapping Linkage Disclosure, the average per-centage of correctly linked records using rank swapping record linkage (RS-RL). Information loss measures are not changed, and, thus, they are computed using the standard measures presented in Section 2.2 .
Table 4 presents the scores as well as the original values before their aggregation, for both Census and EIA datasets protected using standard rank swapping. We can observe that the largest disclosure risk measure in the standard rank swapping. Another interesting result is that PLD is always lower than RSLD and DLD .
This is because all the values in all the attributes are swapped, and therefore the coincidence vectors for the correct links are always equal to zero, unless the swapped positions have the same value (which is possible swapping has the largest disclosure risk when the different parameterizations of the three methods are com-responding to the EIA dataset).

Tables 5 and 6 show the score values for rank swapping p -distribution and rank swapping p -buckets respec-tively. In both cases the largest disclosure risk measure is DLD . Therefore, when an intruder is interested in linking the original dataset with the one protected using any of the two methods, the best way is just consid-ering all possible links.

In Section 6 we discuss a possible record linkage method specifically designed for rank swapping p -distri-we have not considered this method to compute the disclosure risk and the score.

Interval disclosure for standard rank swapping is higher than the one for the two new rank swapping meth-ods. This is so because the rank swapping p -distribution and the p -buckets may do swaps between two far values avoiding the interval disclosure. This is not the case in standard rank swapping.

In general, when we compare the same parameterizations for the three different rank swapping methods ( e.g. rs 2, rs 2-d and rs 75-b), information loss is higher for the rank swapping p -distribution and the rank swapping p -buckets. Nevertheless, disclosure risk is higher for standard rank swapping (in some cases more than 15%) for these parameterizations. In Figs. 6 aand 7 a we can observe that some cases of standard rank swapping have lower information loss than the other rank swapping versions. However, these differences are rather small in most of the cases. See, for example, the IL in the EIA dataset for the fourth parameterization of the three rank swapping methods (rs 8, rs 8-d and rs 30-b). It is clear that the values for IL are rather similar.

In relation to the overall scores, the best scores obtained for the standard rank swapping (see Table 4 ) are 24.77 for Census and 21.42 for EIA. In contrast to that, the best scores obtained for the rank swapping p -dis-tribution (see Table 5 ) are between 20.90 and 21.30 for the Census dataset and between 20.20 and 21.00 for the
EIA dataset. The best score presented in Table 6 for the rank swapping p -buckets is 20.92 for the Census data-set and 20.32 for the EIA dataset. So, the new rank swapping methods lead to better scores and, thus, the trade-off between information loss and disclosure risk benefits the rank swapping methods introduced in this paper. Even though the new methods have a small increment in the information loss, they gain an important rank swapping has the largest score. 6. Specific record linkage methods for the new variations of rank swapping
In Section 2.3 we have shown that standard rank swapping can be attacked using a specific record linkage method. These results have motivated the introduction of two variances of rank swapping, variations that can-hoc attacks might be developed for these new methods. In this section we present another specific record link-age method specially designed for rank swapping p -distribution and p -buckets. We show that this new method, when applied to the same datasets used in Section 5 leads to similar results to the ones obtained with standard distance based record linkage method.

The difficulty of applying record linkage to data protected by rank swapping p -distribution and p -bucket age is not included in the intersection set B ( x i )= \ 1 6 j 6 c useless.

To avoid this, but reducing at the same time the complexity of record linkage, we can consider proper sub-for at least one of the attributes j . In fact, the record will belong to most of the B ( x will be also in the union of the B ( x ij ). That is, in B ( x
We will compute an annotated union that takes into account the number of sets B ( x stored. Then, we assume that the intruder only compares the original record with the protected records which have the maximum cardinality in the annotated union set (i.e., records stored in the maximum number of
B ( x der is exploiting his knowledge of the rank swapping p -distribution and p -buckets because he knows that the probability of a far swap is near to 0.

As we did in Section 3 , we suppose here that the parameter p is known. We have applied this variation of the rank swapping record linkage method to the rank swapping p -distribution. In order to apply the method in the worse case scenario, we also suppose that the intruder has the maximum number of attributes, i.e., the intruder knows the half of the protected attributes (this assumption is the same than in Section 2.2 ). At this point, the intruder needs to decide the size of the intervals B ( x intruder can deduce the confidence of the selected swap intervals. For example, if the swap intervals are
Instead, if the swap intervals are [ i p , i + p ]; then, the same probability increases to 96%. Note that when the union is computed the probability to find the correct link inside increases with respect to the number of attributes known.

Table 7 shows the results for the distance based record linkage and for the rank swapping record linkage with two different swap intervals. The table also includes the results obtained by the DBRL for the same files and number of attributes.

The results show that, in general, when we use the interval [ i p , i + p ] the new method lead to results sim-ilar to the ones by DBRL. There are only two cases were we can find a significant improvement, they corre-spond to the application of the method when p = 2 and p = 4 and using the EIA database. RS-RL finds 1443 records while DBRL finds 1267, and RS-RL finds 419 where DBRL finds 330. Nevertheless, these cases are not a real threat to the protection method because they already correspond to the cases with a lower protection identified by DBRL). Taking this into account, we have that the influence of the results shown here in the score would not be significant.

The table also shows the results for the interval [ i p /2, i + p /2]. This smaller interval reduces more the search than the other one. However, the results obtained by the new record linkage are much worse than the ones obtained by the DBRL.

Summing up, we have that the ad hoc record linkage method has a similar behavior than DBRL, except for a few cases that cannot be considered a great threat to the protection mechanism. 7. Conclusions and future work
In this paper, we have presented a new type of record linkage specially designed to measure the disclosure risk of the rank swapping protection method, and we have shown that this new method outperforms the standard record linkage measures. We have also presented two modifications of rank swapping, called rank swapping p -distribution and rank swapping p -buckets, which make unsuitable the new rank swapping record linkage measure. We have shown that these two new rank swapping methods have lower disclosure risk and better scores than the standard one. Also, we have presented a possible specific attack for the new methods. The analysis performed show that the new protection methods are resistant to our specific ad hoc attacks.

As future work, we plan to further study protection methods where ad hoc disclosure risk measures cannot be applied. Another interesting research line is to study modifications of the rank swapping record linkage (RS-RL) to improve linkage results in very large databases.
