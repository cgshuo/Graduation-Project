 Dependency parsing is the task of building depen-dency links between words in a sentence, which has recently gained a wide interest in the natural lan-guage processing community. With the availabil-ity of large-scale annotated corpora such as Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), it is easy to train a high-performance dependency parser using super-vised learning methods.

However, current state-of-the-art statistical de-pendency parsers (McDonald et al., 2005; McDon-ald and Pereira, 2006; Hall et al., 2006) tend to have lower accuracies for longer dependencies (McDon-ald and Nivre, 2007). The length of a dependency from word w i to word w j is simply equal to | i  X  j | . Longer dependencies typically represent the mod-ifier of the root or the main verb, internal depen-dencies of longer NPs or PP-attachment in a sen-tence. Figure 1 shows the F 1 score 1 relative to the dependency length on the development set by using the graph-based dependency parsers (McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006). We note that the parsers provide very good results for adja-cent dependencies (96.89% for dependency length =1), while the dependency length increases, the ac-curacies degrade sharply. These longer dependen-cies are therefore a major opportunity to improve the overall performance of dependency parsing. Usu-ally, these longer dependencies can be parsed de-pendent on the specific words involved due to the limited range of features (e.g., a verb and its mod-ifiers). Lexical statistics are therefore needed for resolving ambiguous relationships, yet the lexical-ized statistics are sparse and difficult to estimate di-rectly. To solve this problem, some information with different granularity has been investigated. Koo et al. (2008) proposed a semi-supervised dependency parsing by introducing lexical intermediaries at a coarser level than words themselves via a cluster method. This approach, however, ignores the se-lectional preference for word-to-word interactions, such as head-modifier relationship. Extra resources beyond the annotated corpora are needed to capture the bi-lexical relationship at the word-to-word level.
Our purpose in this paper is to exploit web-derived selectional preferences to improve the su-pervised statistical dependency parsing. All of our lexical statistics are derived from two kinds of web-scale corpus: one is the web, which is the largest data set that is available for NLP (Keller and Lap-ata, 2003). Another is a web-scale N-gram corpus, which is a N-gram corpus with N-grams of length 1-5 (Brants and Franz, 2006), we call it Google V1 in this paper. The idea is very simple: web-scale data have large coverage for word pair acquisition. By leveraging some assistant data, the dependency pars-ing model can directly utilize the additional informa-tion to capture the word-to-word level relationships. We address two natural and related questions which some previous studies leave open:
Question I : Is there a benefit in incorporating web-derived selectional preference features for sta-tistical dependency parsing, especially for longer de-pendencies?
Question II : How well do web-derived selec-tional preferences perform on new domains?
For Question I, we systematically assess the value of using web-scale data in state-of-the-art super-vised dependency parsers. We compare dependency parsers that include or exclude selectional prefer-ence features obtained from web-scale corpus. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing stud-ies directly address long dependencies of depen-dency parsing by using web-scale data.

Most statistical parsers are highly domain depen-dent. For example, the parsers trained on WSJ text perform poorly on Brown corpus. Some studies have investigated domain adaptation for parsers (Mc-Closky et al., 2006; Daum  X  e III, 2007; McClosky et al., 2010). These approaches assume that the parsers know which domain it is used, and that it has ac-cess to representative data in that domain. How-ever, in practice, these assumptions are unrealistic in many real applications, such as when processing the heterogeneous genre of web texts. In this paper we incorporate the web-derived selectional prefer-ence features to design our parsers for robust open-domain testing.
 We conduct the experiments on the English Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993). The results show that web-derived selectional preference can improve the statistical dependency parsing, partic-ularly for long dependency relationships. More im-portantly, when operating on new domains, the web-derived selectional preference features show great potential for achieving robust performance (Section 4.3).
 The remainder of this paper is divided as follows. Section 2 gives a brief introduction of dependency parsing. Section 3 describes the web-derived selec-tional preference features. Experimental evaluation and results are reported in Section 4. Finally, we dis-cuss related work and draw conclusion in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively. In dependency parsing, we attempt to build head-modifier (or head-dependent) relations between words in a sentence. The discriminative parser we used in this paper is based on the part-factored model and features of the MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007). The parsing model can be defined as a con-ditional distribution p ( y | x ; w ) over each projective parse tree y for a particular sentence x , parameter-ized by a vector w . The probability of a parse tree is p ( y | x ; w ) = where Z ( x ; w ) is the partition function and  X  are part-factored feature functions that include head-modifier parts, sibling parts and grandchild parts. Given the training set { ( x i , y i ) } N i =1 , parameter es-timation for log-linear models generally resolve around optimization of a regularized conditional log-likelihood objective w  X  = arg min w L ( w ) where The parameter C &gt; 0 is a constant dictating the level of regularization in the model. Since objec-tive function L ( w ) is smooth and convex, which is convenient for standard gradient-based optimization techniques. In this paper we use the dual exponenti-ated gradient (EG) 2 descent, which is a particularly effective optimization algorithm for log-linear mod-els (Collins et al., 2008). In this paper, we employ two different feature sets: a baseline feature set 3 which draw upon  X  X ormal X  information source, such as word forms and part-of-speech (POS) without including the web-derived se-lectional preference 4 features, a feature set conjoins the baseline features and the web-derived selectional preference features. 3.1 Web-scale resources All of our selectional preference features described in this paper rely on probabilities derived from unla-beled data. To use the largest amount of data possi-ble, we exploit web-scale resources. one is web, N-gram counts are approximated by Google hits . An-other we use is Google V1 (Brants and Franz, 2006). This N-gram corpus records how often each unique sequence of words occurs. N-grams appearing 40 times or more (1 in 25 billion) are kept, and appear in the n-gram tables. All n-grams with lower counts are discarded. Co-occurrence probabilities can be calculated directly from the N-gram counts. 3.2 Web-derived N-gram features 3.2.1 PMI
Previous work on noun compounds bracketing has used adjacency model (Resnik, 1993) and de-pendency model (Lauer, 1995) to compute associa-tion statistics between pairs of words. In this pa-per we generalize the adjacency and dependency models by including the pointwise mutual informa-tion (Church and Hanks, 1900) between all pairs of words in the dependency tree: where p ( X  x y  X ) is the co-occurrence probabilities. When use the Google V1 corpus, this probabilities can be calculated directly from the N-gram counts, while using the Google hits , we send the queries to the search engine Google 5 and all the search queries are performed as exact matches by using quotation marks. 6
The value of these features is the PMI, if it is de-fined. If the PMI is undefined, following the work of (Pitler et al., 2010), we include one of two binary features:
Besides, we also consider the trigram features be-tween the three words in the dependency tree: This kinds of trigram features, for example in MST-Parser, which can directly capture the sibling and grandchild features.

We illustrate the PMI features with an example of dependency parsing tree in Figure 2. In deciding the dependency between the main verb hit and its ar-gument headed preposition with , an example of the N-gram PMI features and the conjoin features with the baseline are shown in Table 1. 3.2.2 PP-attachment
Propositional phrase (PP) attachment is one of the hardest problems in English dependency pars-ing. An English sentence consisting of a subject, a verb, and a nominal object followed by a preposi-tional phrase is often ambiguous. Ambiguity resolu-tion reflects the selectional preference between the verb and noun with their prepositional phrase. For example, considering the following two examples: (1) John hit the ball with the bat . (2) John hit the ball with the red stripe . In sentence (1), the preposition with depends on the main verb hit ; but in sentence (2), the prepositional phrase is a noun attribute and the preposition with needs to depends on the word ball . To resolve this kind of ambiguity, there needs to measure the attach-ment preference. We thus have PP-attachment fea-tures that determine the PMI association across the preposition word  X  IN  X  7 : where the word x and y are usually verb and noun, z is a noun which directly depends on the preposi-tion word  X  IN  X . For example in sentence (1), we would include the features PMI with ( hit, bat ) and PMI with ( ball, bat ) . If both PMI features exist and PMI with ( hit, bat ) &gt; PMI with ( ball, bat ) , indicating to our dependency parsing model that the preposi-tion word with depends on the verb hit is a good choice. While in sentence (2), the features include PMI with ( hit, stripe ) and PMI with ( ball, stripe ) . 3.3 N-gram feature templates We generate N-gram features by mimicking the template structure of the original baseline features. For example, the baseline feature set includes indi-cators for word-to-word and tag-to-tag interactions between the head and modifier of a dependency. In the N-gram feature set, we correspondingly intro-duce N-gram PMI for word-to-word interactions. The N-gram feature set for MSTParser is shown in Table 2. Following McDonald et al. (2005), all features are conjoined with the direction of attachment as well as the distance between the two words creating the dependency. In between N-gram features, we include the form of word trigrams and PMI of the trigrams. The surrounding word N-gram features represent the local context of the selectional preference. Besides, we also present the second-order feature templates, including the sibling and grandchild features. These features are designed to disambiguate cases like coordinating conjunctions and prepositional attachment. Con-sider the examples we have shown in section 3.2.2, for sentence (1), the dependency graph path feature ball  X  with  X  bat should have a lower weight since ball rarely is modified by bat , but is often seen through them (e.g., a higher weight should be associated with hit  X  with  X  bat ). In contrast, for sentence (2), our N-gram features will tell us that the prepositional phrase is much more likely to attach to the noun since the dependency graph path feature ball  X  with  X  stripe should have a high weight due to the high strength of selectional preference between ball and stripe .

Web-derived selectional preference features based on PMI values are trickier to incorporate into the dependency parsing model because they are continuous rather than discrete. Since all the baseline features used in the literature (McDonald et al., 2005; Carreras, 2007) take on binary values of 0 or 1, there is a  X  X is-match X  between the continuous and binary features. Log-linear dependency parsing model is sensitive to inappropriately scaled feature. To solve this problem, we transform the PMI values into a more amenable form by replacing the PMI values with their z -score . The z -score of a PMI value x is x  X   X   X  , where  X  and  X  are the mean and standard deviation of the PMI distribution, respectively. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted dependency parsing exper-iments in English. The experiments were performed on the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993), using a standard set of head-selection rules (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003) to convert the phrase struc-ture syntax of the Treebank into a dependency tree representation, dependency labels were obtained via the  X  X alt X  hard-coded setting. 8 We split the Tree-bank into a training set (Sections 2-21), a devel-opment set (Section 22), and several test sets (Sec-tions 0, 9 1, 23, and 24). The part-of-speech tags for the development and test set were automatically as-signed by the MXPOST tagger 10 , where the tagger was trained on the entire training corpus.

Web page hits for word pairs and trigrams are ob-tained using a simple heuristic query to the search engine Google . 11 Inflected queries are performed by expanding a bigram or trigram into all its mor-phological forms. These forms are then submitted as literal queries, and the resulting hits are summed up. John Carroll X  X  suite of morphological tools 12 is used to generate inflected forms of verbs and nouns. All the search terms are performed as exact matches by using quotation marks and submitted to the search engines in lower case.

We measured the performance of the parsers us-ing the following metrics: unlabeled attachment score (UAS), labeled attachment score (LAS) and complete match (CM), which were defined by Hall et al. (2006). All the metrics are calculated as mean scores per word, and punctuation tokens are consis-tently excluded. 4.1 Main results There are some clear trends in the results of Ta-ble 3. First, performance increases with the order of the parser: edge-factored model (dep1) has the lowest performance, adding sibling and grandchild relationships (dep2) significantly increases perfor-mance. Similar observations regarding the effect of model order have also been made by Carreras (2007) and Koo et al. (2008).

Second, note that the parsers incorporating the N-gram feature sets consistently outperform the mod-els using the baseline features in all test data sets, regardless of model order or label usage. Another finding is that the N-gram features derived from Google hits are slightly better than Google V1 due to the large N-gram coverage, we will discuss later. As a final note, all the comparisons between the inte-gration of N-gram features and the baseline features in Table 3 are mildly significant using the Z-test of Collins et al. (2005) ( p &lt; 0 . 08 ).

To put our results in perspective, we also com-pare them with other best-performing systems in Ta-ble 4. To facilitate comparisons with previous work, we only use Section 23 as the test data. The re-sults show that our second order model incorpo-rating the N-gram features (92.64) performs better than most previously reported discriminative sys-tems trained on the Treebank. Carreras et al. (2008) reported a very high accuracy using information of constituent structure of TAG grammar formalism, while in our system, we do not use such knowl-edge. When compared to the combined systems, our system is better than Nivre and McDonald (2008) and Zhang and Clark (2008), but a slightly worse than Martins et al. (2008). We also compare our method with the semi-supervised approaches, the semi-supervised approaches achieved very high ac-curacies by leveraging on large unlabeled data di-rectly into the systems for joint learning and decod-ing, while in our method, we only explore the N-gram features to further improve supervised depen-dency parsing performance.

Table 5 shows the details of some other N-gram sources, where NEWS : created from a large set of news articles including the Reuters and Gigword (Graff, 2003) corpora. For a given number of unique N-gram, using any of these sources does not have significant difference in Figure 3. Google hits is the largest N-gram data and shows the best perfor-mance. The other two are smaller ones, accuracies increase linearly with the log of the number of types in the auxiliary data set. Similar observations have been made by Pitler et al. (2010). We see that the relationship between accuracy and the number of N-gram is not monotonic for Google V1. The reason may be that Google V1 does not make detailed pre-processing, containing many mistakes in the corpus. Although Google hits is noisier, it has very much larger coverage of bigrams or trigrams.

Some previous studies also found a log-linear relationship between unlabeled data (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008; Suzuki et al., 2009; Bergsma et al., 2010; Pitler et al., 2010). We have shown that this trend continues well for dependency parsing by us-ing web-scale data (NEWS and Google V1). 4.2 Improvement relative to dependency length The experiments in (McDonald and Nivre, 2007) showed a negative impact on the dependency pars-ing performance from too long dependencies. For our proposed approach, the improvement relative to dependency length is shown in Figure 4. From the Figure, it is seen that our method gives observ-able better performance when dependency lengths are larger than 3. The results here show that the proposed approach improves the dependency pars-ing performance, particularly for long dependency relationships. 4.3 Cross-genre testing In this section, we present the experiments to vali-date the robustness the web-derived selectional pref-erences. The intent is to understand how well the web-derived selectional preferences transfer to other sources.

The English experiment evaluates the perfor-mance of our proposed approach when it is trained on annotated data from one genre of text (WSJ) and is used to parse a test set from a different genre: the biomedical domain related to cancer (PennBioIE., 2005) with 2,600 parsed sentences. We divided the data into 500 for training, 100 for development and others for testing. We created five sets of train-ing data with 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 sen-tences respectively. Figure 5 plots the UAS ac-curacy as function of training instances. WSJ is the performance of our second-order dependency parser trained on section 2-21; WSJ+N-gram is the performance of our proposed approach trained on section 2-21; WSJ+BioMed is the performance of the parser trained on WSJ and biomedical data. WSJ+BioMed+N-gram is the performance of our proposed approach trained on WSJ and biomedical data. The results show that incorporating the web-scale N-gram features can significantly improve the dependency parsing performance, and the improve-ment is much larger than the in-domain testing pre-sented in Section 4.1, the reason may be that web-derived N-gram features do not depend directly on training data and thus work better on new domains. 4.4 Discussion In this paper, we present a novel method to im-prove dependency parsing by using web-scale data. Despite the success, there are still some problems which should be discussed. (1) Google hits is less sparse than Google V1 in modeling the word-to-word relationships, but Google hits are likely to be noisier than Google V1. It is very appealing to carry out a correlation anal-ysis to determine whether Google hits and Google V1 are highly correlated. We will leave it for future research. (2) Veronis (2005) pointed out that there had been a debate about reliability of Google hits due to the inconsistencies of page hits estimates. However, this estimate is scale-invariant. Assume that when the number of pages indexed by Google grows, the num-ber of pages containing a given search term goes to a fixed fraction. This means that if pages indexed by Google doubles, then so do the bigrams or tri-grams frequencies. Therefore, the estimate becomes stable when the number of indexed pages grows un-boundedly. Some details are presented in Cilibrasi and Vitanyi (2007). Our approach is to exploit web-derived selectional preferences to improve the dependency parsing. The idea of this paper is inspired by the work of Suzuki et al. (2009) and Pitler et al. (2010). The former uses the web-scale data explicitly to create more data for training the model; while the latter explores the web-scale N-grams data (Lin et al., 2010) for compound bracketing disambiguation. Our research, however, applies the web-scale data ( Google hits and Google V1 ) to model the word-to-word dependency rela-tionships rather than compound bracketing disam-biguation.

Several previous studies have exploited the web-scale data for word pair acquisition. Keller and Lapata (2003) evaluated the utility of using web search engine statistics for unseen bigram. Nakov and Hearst (2005) demonstrated the effectiveness of using search engine statistics to improve the noun compound bracketing. Volk (2001) exploited the WWW as a corpus to resolve PP attachment ambigu-ities. Turney (2007) measured the semantic orienta-tion for sentiment classification using co-occurrence statistics obtained from the search engines. Bergsma et al. (2010) created robust supervised classifiers via web-scale N-gram data for adjective ordering, spelling correction, noun compound bracketing and verb part-of-speech disambiguation. Our approach, however, extends these techniques to dependency parsing, particularly for long dependency relation-ships, which involves more challenging tasks than the previous work.

Besides, there are some work exploring the word-to-word co-occurrence derived from the web-scale data or a fixed size of corpus (Calvo and Gel-bukh, 2004; Calvo and Gelbukh, 2006; Yates et al., 2006; Drabek and Zhou, 2000; van Noord, 2007) for PP attachment ambiguities or shallow parsing. Johnson and Riezler (2000) incorporated the lex-ical selectional preference features derived from British National Corpus (Graff, 2003) into a stochas-tic unification-based grammar. Abekawa and Oku-mura (2006) improved Japanese dependency pars-ing by using the co-occurrence information derived from the results of automatic dependency parsing of large-scale corpora. However, we explore the web-scale data for dependency parsing, the performance improves log-linearly with the number of parameters (unique N-grams). To the best of our knowledge, web-derived selectional preference has not been suc-cessfully applied to dependency parsing. In this paper, we present a novel method which in-corporates the web-derived selectional preferences to improve statistical dependency parsing. The re-sults show that web-scale data improves the de-pendency parsing, particularly for long dependency relationships. There is no data like more data, performance improves log-linearly with the num-ber of parameters (unique N-grams). More impor-tantly, when operating on new domains, the web-derived selectional preferences show great potential for achieving robust performance.
