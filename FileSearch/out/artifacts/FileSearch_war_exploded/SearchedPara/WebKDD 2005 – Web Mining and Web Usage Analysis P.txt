 In this report, we summarize the contents and outcomes of the recent WebKDD 2005 workshop on Web Mining and Web Usage Analysis that was held in conjunction with the 11th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2005), August 21-24, 2005, in Chicago, Illinois. The theme of this workshop was  X  Taming Evolving, Expanding and Multi-faceted Web Clickstreams X  . We also reflect on possible new directions in Web mining research as reflecte d by the discussions and the talks during the workshop. Web mining, profiling, personalization, clickstream analysis recommender systems, mi ning evolving web data. WebKDD 2005 is the seventh of a successful series of workshops on knowledge discovery on the Web. The WebKDD X 05 workshop continued its tradition of serving as a bridge between academia and industry by bringing together practitioners and researchers from both areas in order to foster the exchange of ideas and the dissemination of emerging solutions for intellig ent Web-based applications using Web usage, structure and content mining. The theme of this year X  X  WebKDD workshop was  X  Taming Evolving, Expanding and Multi-faceted Web Clickstreams X . While solutions on some of the infancy problems of Web analysis reach maturity, the reality poses new challenges: Most of the solutions on web data analysis assume a static Web, in which a solitary user interacts with a Web site. It is prime time to depart from such simplifying assumptions and conceive solutions that are clos er to Web reality: The Web is evolving constantly; sites change a nd user preferences drift. Clickstream data that form the basis of Web analysis are, obviously, streams rather than static datasets. And, most of all, a Web site is more than a see-and-click medium; it is a venue where a user interacts with a site owner or with other users, where group behavior is exhibited, communities are formed and experiences are shared. Furthermore, the inherent and increasing heterogeneity of the Web has required Web-based applications to more effe ctively integrate a variety of types of data across multiple channels and from different sources in addition to usage , such as content , structure , and semantics . A focus on techniques and architectures for more effective exploitation and mining of such multi-faceted data is likely to stimulate a next generation of intelligent applications. Recommendation systems form a prominent application area of Web analysis. One of the emerging issues in this area is the vulnerability of a Web site and its users towards abuse and offence.  X  X ow should an intelligent recommender system be designed to resist various malicious manipulations, such as schilling attacks that try to alter user ratings to influence the recommendations? X  This motivates the need to study and design robust recommender systems. WEBKDD'05 addressed these emerging aspects of Web reality. 17 papers were submitted to WebKDD 2005 and were strictly reviewed by at least three reviewers from the WebKDD 2005 program committee. After review, only 9 papers were accepted for the wo rkshop. They are available at http://db.cs.ulberta. ca/webkdd05/proceedings.html . According to the topics, the pa pers were grouped into four categories: (i) Recommendation systems and Personalization, (ii) Web Usage Mining and Profiling, and (iii) Pattern Importance and Semantics. The workshop attracted interest from a large number of conference participants. Over 100 conference attendees had pre-registered for WebKDD X 05 before it started, and at any given time throughout the day, there were between 30 and 50 participants attending the talks. In addition to several people from academia, one third of the workshop participants came from the industry, including Microsoft, Amazon, Yahoo, E-Bay, Siemens, Overstock.com, and a few other companies. The paper presentations were segmented into three sessions according to their main topics, as described below. In addition to the talks by the authors of the accepted papers, we had an interesting and timely in vited talk by Charu Aggarwal from IBM Research, who brought some perspectives from the area of mining evolving data streams in support of the workshop theme of this year. Charu Aggarwal, from IBM T.J. Watson center, talked about understanding, visualizing, and diagnosing the evolution of temporal trends in data st reams based on the concept of velocity density estimation. Velocity density estimation is used to create temporal veloc ity profiles and spatial velocity profiles at periodic instants in time. After further discussing the problem of data stream evol ution in the context of other kinds of data such as graphs or community detection, clustering and classification, Charu also discussed the importance of using the evolution process in order to improve the effectiveness of data mining algorithms. The three papers of this session dealt with Recommendation systems and Personalization . The first paper focused on The Multi-Faceted Aspect of Web Personalization . In USER (User Sensitive Expert Recomm endation): What Non-Experts NEED to Know , DeLong, Desikan, and Srivastava addressed the problem of providing expert -driven recommendations to non-experts, helping them understand what they need to know, as opposed to what is pop ular among other users. The approach adopts a  X  X odel of learning X  in which user questions are dynamically interpreted as the user navigates through the Web site and are then used to formulate recommendations. The next paper dealt with Search Personalization . In Personalized Ranking of Search Results with Learned User Interest Hierarchies from Bookmarks : Kim and Chan proposed to learn a user profile, called a user interest hierarchy (UIH), from web pages that are of interest to the user, as implicitly inferred from their Bookmark collections. Using the UIH, they studied methods that (re-)rank the results of a search e ngine to improve relevance. The third paper was in the area of Secure Web Personalization : In Effective Attack Models for Shilling Item-Based Collaborative Filtering Systems, Mobasher, Burke, Bhaumik, and Williams examined several attack models and recommendation techniques relative to the costs and benefits of mounting an attack. They then presented a new attack model that focuses on a subset of users with similar tastes and showed that such an attack can be highly successful against an item-based collaborative filtering algorithm. Three papers focused on Web Usage Mining and Profiling . The first paper, kNN Versus SVM in the Collaborative Filtering Framework , Grcar, Fortuna, Mladenic, and Grobelnik presented empirical results comparing the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm with Support Vector Machines (SVM) in the collaborative filtering framework using data sets with differe nt properties. The authors concluded that the quality of collaborative filtering recommendations is highly dependent on the quality of the data. The next paper addressed the problem of Mining Evolving Web Usage Data . In Incremental Relational Fuzzy Subtractive Clustering for Dynamic Web Usage Profiling , Suryavanshi, Shiri, and Mudur presented a web usage profile maintenance scheme using the Relational Fuzzy Subtractive Clustering algorithm (RFSC) that can add new usage data to an existing model without the expense associated with frequent remodeling. They de fined a quantitative measure that indicates when remodeling should be performed to avoid a degradation of the model. In Discovery of Significant Usage Patterns from Clusters of Clickstream Data , Lu, Dunham, and Meng presented a variation of the  X  X ser preferred navigational trail X  called Significant Usage Pattern (SUP). SUPs are patterns that are extracted from clustered abstracted clickstream data, with a higher normalized probability of occurrence. Af ter grouping Web sessions into clusters, sessions are abstracted again using a concept-based abstraction approach and a firs t-order Markov model is built for each cluster of sessions. The last group of papers dealt with Pattern Importance and Semantics . In The Semantics of Frequent Subgraphs: Mining and Navigation Pattern Analysis , Berendt introduced the AP-IP (Abstract Pattern  X  Indivi dual Pattern) mining problem, and presents the AP-IP algorithm that solves it. AP-IP uses a taxonomy and searches for frequen t patterns at an abstract level, but also returns th e individual (but infrequent) subgraphs that constitute this pattern. She also presented a procedure for mining patterns at the concept level. In Heterogeneous Attribute Utility Model: A New Approach for Modeling User Profiles for Recommendation Systems , Schickel and Faltings made th e case that both Collaborative filtering and Preference-based techniques currently require more data about a customer than is usually available to make accurate recommendations. They proposed a new method, called Heterogeneous Attribute Utility Model (HAUM), where the structure of user preferences is assumed to follow an ontology of product attributes. In addition to the discussions that followed each presentation, there was an ex citing discussion among all the participants in the workshop just before closing the WebKDD X 05 workshop. These di scussions helped raise several questions and bring to li ght several interesting future directions and challenges in the area of Web mining. In particular, participants discusse d the effect of the quality of the ontology on the final recommendations when semantics are taken into account. More speci fically, at what particular level of abstraction, do we obtain optimal results, and how the results compare depending on whether the ontology is hand crafted or learned automatically? The submissions on the Semantic Web and the disc ussion thread on semantics of web data indicate great interest and many ongoing efforts in this area. The discussions also brought out the issue of scalability of web usage mining techniques and the difficulty in handling evolving web data. Some have complained from the lack of benchmark data sets to study and test tasks that are related to mining evolving patterns, while others raised the problem of validation in the context of mining evolving web data. We hope that the discussions and this report will encourage researchers to explore some of these challenges, and perhaps present some of their answers in future workshops.
