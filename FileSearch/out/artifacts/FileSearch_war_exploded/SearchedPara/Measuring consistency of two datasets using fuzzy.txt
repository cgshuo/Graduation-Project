 1. Introduction
A great number of data mining methods have been developed for exploiting complex relations among multiple datasets. Nowa-days, the most commonly used methods are based on statistics, including Linear Regression Analysis ( Weisgerg, 2005 ), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ( Jolliffe, 2002 ), Multidimensional
Scaling ( Hollins et al., 1997; Picard, 2003 ), Multiple Factor Analysis ( Howorth and Oliver, 1958; Le Dien, 2003 ) and various kinds of correlation coef fi cient analysis ( H X rdle and Simar, 2003 ). These methods are ef fi cient in solving a lot of characterization and modeling problems from datasets due to their good capacity of identifying linear patterns from different information sources and then discovering correlations between data and between attributes from a big quantity of numerical data. And also for this reason, these methods have been widely employed to various research fi elds, including economics, medicine, biology, chemistry and engineering. ( Agresti and Finlay, 1997 ).

However, modeling of relations between different datasets usually encounters problems of uncertainty and imprecision, and the classical methodologies are gradually showing their drawbacks in practice. First, when a problem is dealing with human knowl-edge, the concerned relations are often nonlinear. The application of the frequently used statistical techniques might cause impor-tant information loss due to their linearly structured models. Next, in many cases, there exists high uncertainty and imprecision in data structures due to non-uni fi ed linguistic human evaluation scores. But most of the classical analysis methods can only process perfect and complete numerical data without any uncertainty and imprecision. Next, the classical methods cannot always lead to precise and signi fi cant physical interpretation of data, and the obtained correlation results cannot be used to analyze all types of relations between datasets such as inclusion, causal and association relations. Finally, the classical methods often have strict requests on the size and distribution of the database. But collection of a great number of physically measured or human evaluation data is quite time-consuming and sometimes not practical for many research, for example in pilot studies. With a limited collection of samples, it is unlikely to obtain good t modeling results using the classical methods.

In this situation, intelligent computational techniques, such as arti fi cial neural network (ANNs) ( Fausett, 1994 ), genetic algorithm (GA) ( Goldberg, 1989 ), fuzzy logic ( Zadeh, 1965; Sugeno and
Yasukawa, 1993 ) and many hybrid applications of these tools ( Ruan, 1997 ), have largely been applied to modeling and analysis with physical and human data. They have high capacity in (1) solving nonlinear problems, (2) dealing with both numerical and linguistic data, (3) modeling human expert reasoning so as to produce precise and straightforward interpretation of results, and (4) computing with relatively small sets of data and without need of any pre-liminary or additional information like probabilistic distributions in statistics. Of all these intelligent computational tools, the importance of the introduced notion of fuzzy set was properly realized by the research worker in all the branches of science and technology and has successfully been applied. Recently fuzzy set theory has been applied in matrix transformations by Tripathy and Baruah (2010) ,in mathematical analysis by Tripathy and Borgogain (2011) , Tripathy et al. (2012) , in topology by Tripathy and Debnath (2013) ,inmixed fuzzy topology by Tripathy and Ray (2012) ,infuzzylogicby Sugeno and Yasukawa (1993) , in rough mereology by Polkowski and Skowron (1994a) and many others.

In the current study, assuming that we have two datasets obtained from different measuring systems on one collection of items (products, consumers, ... ), we propose a novel method to measure how much the information quantity of one dataset is included in another one. It is particularly signi fi cant for validating one measuring or evaluation system with respect to a standard reference. For example, using this method, we can determine if a newly developed cheap measuring device can completely take into account the main features given by an old expensive measuring system. The proposed method was built using fuzzy techniques and the concept of indiscernibility of rough sets theories ( Pawlak, 1982 ).

Rough set theory has been widely applied for measuring classi fi cation-based consistency or inclusion degree of two data-sets ( Qian et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2012 ). In practice, it is considered as more relevant for processing small sets of objects. However, in our study, there exist two following particularities different from the classical application scenarios of rough set theory: (1) the objects in our datasets can be fully arranged in order for each speci fi c attribute while those in a general dataset can just be classi fi ed and (2) the objects in our datasets mostly correspond to real measuring data. Therefore, in this special context, the classical inclusion degree, dealing with classi fi cation of objects, has been modi fi ed by introducing fuzzy techniques in order to take into account of neighboring relations of objects and their relations with respect to normalized measuring scales. The crisp partition of objects is then transformed into a fuzzy partition of objects related to a set of normalized scores. Also, the general consistency has been obtained by combining the previous classi fi cation-based consistency and Kendall's coef fi cient-based ranking consistency.
Therefore, the equivalence and neighboring relations of objects as well as ranks of objects in each dataset have been taken into account in this general consistency degree. The overall consistency criterion is believed to be capable of detecting nonlinear patterns lying beneath datasets while being safe to use a comparatively small number of experimental samples. Moreover, this new method can prevent the  X  black box  X  phenomenon encountered in many modeling techniques and produce robust and interpre-table results. 2. Fuzzy classi fi cation consistency of two datasets 2.1. Classi fi cation consistency (CCons) one dataset to another one is de fi ned by using the concept of indiscernibility of the rough sets theory, developed by Zdzislaw
Pawlak in the early 1980s. It is a relatively new soft computing tool for solving imperfect data analysis. Rough set approach has become a popular mathematical framework in many research areas such as data mining, knowledge discovery from database, decision support, feature selection and pattern recognition ( Pawlak,1998; Pawlak and
Skowron, 2007; Qian et al., 2007 ). According to Pawlak (1998) , indiscernibility relation , characterizing equivalence relations of dif-ferent objects, is a central concept of rough set theory. In our paper, this concept, together with the other concepts frequently used in rough set theory, such as decision table and rough mereology , constitute the main theoretical foundation of the proposed approach. 2.1.1. Indiscernibility the universe of discourse is associated with some information (data, knowledge). Objects characterized by the same information are indiscernible ( similar ) with the available knowledge about them. The indiscernibility relation generated in this way is the mathematical basis of rough set theory. Any set of all indiscernible objects is called an elementary set, and expresses a basic gra-nule of knowledge about the universe of discourse. Any union of some elementary sets is referred to as a crisp (precise) set, otherwise the set is rough (imprecise). In other words, a crisp set expresses knowledge that can be subdivided into all discern-ible granules, whereas a rough set cannot be precisely character-ized with available knowledge, or contains knowledge that cannot be decisively subdivided or discerned. Since rough sets theory addresses granularity of knowledge, expressed by the indiscern-ibility relation, we are unable to deal with single object but we have to consider clusters of indiscernible objects, as fundamental concepts of the theory. 2.1.2. Information system and decision table deals with the classi fi catory analysis of information (data, knowl-edge). A rough set-based data analysis starts from a data table, called an information system.
 (a) U is a non-empty fi nite set of objects, or the universe; (b) A is a non-empty fi nite set of attributes; and (c) for every a A A , there is a mapping a : U -V a , where V ibility relation IND ( P )de fi ned by IND P  X  X  X f u ; v  X  X  A U U j8 a A P ; au  X  X  X  av  X  X g
P D A , the relation IND ( P ) constitutes a partition of U , which is denoted by U / IND ( P ), or just U / P . An information system in which values of all attributes for all objects from U are known is called complete, otherwise it is incomplete.
 classes of attributes, named condition and decision attributes, respectively, then the system will be called a decision table and will be denoted by S  X  ( U , C [ D ), in which C and D are disjoint sets of condition and decision attributes, respectively. In the same manner, a decision table can be complete or incomplete according to whether there exist unknown values on the attributes. In the current study, only complete decision tables are concerned during our analysis. 2.1.3. Formalization of classi fi cation consistency (CCons)
The formalization of classi fi cation consistency is developed as follows. 2.1.3.1. Problematic. The formalization of the classi fi cation con-sistency ( CCons ) is given below. Let U  X  { e 1 , e 2 , ... n items or samples. These samples are measured on two different attributes, permitting to generate two data vectors or datasets, denoted as C  X  ( c ( e 1 ) ... c ( e n )) T and D  X  ( d ( e pectively. We consider that all the data c ( e i )' s and d ( e values varying between 0 and m ( m  X  1 normalized scores), C is taken as condition variable and D as decision variable. According to rough sets philosophy, the knowledge acquisition is in fact a process of knowledge classi fi cation. Different knowledge would generate different partitions of data. From the previous two vectors of C and D , we obtain two partitions of m  X  1 classes, i.e.
U / C  X  { X 0 , X 1 , ... , X m } and U / D  X  { Y 0 , Y 1 values of the corresponding attribute are all the closest to i (or all the closest to j ). In these partitions, all real data of C and
D distributed in [0, m ] are affected to their closest integers. In practice, some X i (or Y j ) can be empty if its index i (or j ) are not close to any value of the samples e k ' s( k  X  1, ... , n ).
An illustrative example is below to show how the partitions U / C and U / Y are constructed from the datasets C and D of Table 1 .In this example, we have 6 samples ( n  X  6) and 11 normalized scores from 0 to 10 ( m  X  11). According to the data of Table 1 and the previous formalization, we have X 2  X  { e 3 }, X 3  X  { e
X  X  { e 5 }, X 8  X  { e 4 }, X 9  X  { e 6 }, and Y 1  X  { e 3 }, Y { e }, Y 8  X  { e 4 }, Y 9  X  { e 6 }. The other X i 's and Y j
Based on the previous formalization, we compute the extent to which the partition of the condition dataset is consistent with that of the decision dataset. 2.1.3.2. Rough mereology. As was discussed previously, according to rough set philosophy, we are unable to perceive individual con-structs, but only their collections. In consequence, by comparing two sets of data, we cannot deal with the membership relation, but only the containment relation. Mereology is such kind of theory which is based on the notion of part-whole relation. It was proposed by Le  X  niewski (1916, 1992 ) as originally a scheme to avoid the Russell's antinomy (also known as Russell's paradox) in naive set theory of Cantor. In fact, it is the fi rst modern mathe-matical system dealing with relations of being a (proper) part.
Just as that fuzzy logic is an approach of approximate reason-ing, the counterpart of fuzzy membership function in rough set theory is the notion of partial containment, which constitutes the basic of the so-called rough mereology developed by Polkowski and Skowron (1994a) . In fact, Rough mereology can be regarded as on the one hand a far-reaching generalization of mereology of Le  X  niewski, and on the other hand a new point of view of introducing methods of merelogy into rough set data analysis. Rough mereology replaces the relation of being a (proper) part with a hierarchy of relations of being a part in a degree. The formal treatment of partial containment is provided by the notion of a rough inclusion ( Polkowski and Skowron, 1994b, 1995 ), which is constructed as most general functional object conveying the intuitive meaning of the relation of being a part in a degree. So, rough mereology is also called the theory of rough inclusion. In particular, the relation of being a part in the greatest possible degree is the relation of being a (possibly improper) part in the sense of the mereology of Le  X  niewski. 2.1.3.3. Inclusion degree. According to rough mereology, the standard rough inclusion is de fi ned as follows.

Let ( X , r ) be a poset (i.e., partially ordered set) characterized by the following properties: (i) x r x (re fl exive) (ii) x r y , y r x ) x  X  y (antisymmetric), and (iii) x r y , y r z ) x r z (transitive) make the following conditions hold: (i) 0 r Inc( y / x ) r 1(( x , y ) A X  X  ); (ii) x r y ) Inc ( y / x )  X  1(( x , y ) A X  X  ); (iii) z r x r y ) Inc ( z / y ) r Inc ( z / x )(( x , y , z ) (iv) x r y )8 z A X , Inc ( x / z ) r Inc ( y / z )(( x , y ) then Inc is called an inclusion degree on X .

On this basis, let X , Y be two fi nite sets. If X D Y , then we say that X is included in Y ,or X is consistent with respect to Y . Thus, the inclusion degree Inc ( Y / X )isde fi ned as follows: Inc  X  Y = X  X  X  j X \ Y j j X j  X  1  X 
In the following discussion, we study the relation of the two partitions de fi ned previously, i.e. U / C  X  { X 0 , X 1 { Y , Y 1 , ... , Y m }. U / D can be rewritten by U / D  X  {[ e {1, ... , n }}. [ e k ] D is the set of samples that are classi same group as e k according to the decision attribute D . In the and Y by [ e k ] D , we derive from Eq. (1) the inclusion degree of X with respect to [ e j ] D as follows: Inc  X  X  e k D = X i  X  X  j X i \ X  e k D j j X where 0 r Inc ([ e k ] D / X i ) r 1.

In fact, this formulation of inclusion degree is in agreement with that of the rough membership function of e k in X i ( Pawlak, 1982 ), de fi ned according to rough sets theory. It is evident that, if Inc ([ e r 1, then X i canbesaidtobeconsistentwithrespectto[ e k ] D illustrative example, we have Inc ([ e 3 ] D / X 2 )  X  1, Inc ([ e
Based on the previous formalization, the classi fi cation consistency-based inclusion degree ( CCons )of X i , namely one class of the condition partition U / C , with respect to the decision partition U / D is de Cons  X  X i ; D  X  X  1 4 n  X  n
This equation is explained below. By denoting G ( e k , X ([ e ( e , X i , D ) r 1/4. In this relation, G ( e k , X i , D )  X  0 when Inc ([ e 0 or 1, corresponding to the best case of class consistency between
X and [ e k ] D . G ( e k , X i , D )  X  1/4 when Inc ([ e k case of class consistency between X i and [ e k ] D ). By generalizing for all objects e k 's, we obtain Cons  X  X i ; D  X  X  1  X  4 = n  X  and 0 r Cons X i ; D  X  X  r 1. From this relation, we can fi ( X , D )  X  1 when X i is consistent with all [ e k ] D 's (the best case) and Cons ( X i , D )  X  0 when X i is inconsistent with any [ e worst case).

Then, on the above basis, the classi fi cation consistency-based degree of C with respect to D is de fi ned by
CCons  X  C ; D  X  X   X  m
It is obtained by aggregating the consistency degrees of all the classes of the condition partition U / C with respect to the decision partition U / D . 2.2. Fuzzy classi fi cation consistency
In practice, an inclusion degree based on the previous crisp partitions of samples according to which any sample is sharply discriminated as either member or non-member of a class, might lead to serious information loss. For a sample e k not belonging to a class X i , its adhesion to this class is consequently taken as zero. For any speci fi c class, it does not make any difference between samples close to it and those far from it. But in many real-world problems, we frequently encounter ill-de fi ned concepts. The de -nition of each attribute is imprecise as well as the signi the corresponding classes. Taking a tactile descriptor pair pliable  X  as an example, one of its evaluation scores is  X  , which can be represented by a class X 2 . Obviously, the two-valued characteristic function used in crisp sets is no longer capable of describing this vague concept since the corresponding class has imprecise boundaries. Therefore, it is meaningful to associate a grade with any sample to quantify its degree of adhesion to X that the samples closer to this class are considered to go better with the concept  X  quite stiff  X  than those far from it.
According to the above idea, we modify the previous classi tion consistency-based inclusion degree by using the concept of fuzzy partition ( Dubois et al., 1996 ).

For any sample e k A U , the modi fi ed inclusion degree for one denoted as FInc ([ e k ] D / X i ), is given by
FInc  X  X  e k D = X i  X  X   X  n
In the fuzzy version, the class [ e k ] D is de fi ned according to the membership degrees of the sample e k for D , i.e.  X  e k D  X  Y q so that
The classes X i 's and Y j 's constitute two fuzzy partitions for the attributes C and D and they are characterized by the fuzzy membership functions  X  X  X  e  X  X  max f 1 h j i c  X  e  X j ; 0 g X  7  X   X  e  X  X  max f 1 h j j d  X  e  X j ; 0 g X  8  X 
They are triangular functions centered on i and j respectively. h is the coef fi cient controlling the sensitivity of these functions. c ( e ) and d ( e ) are data of the sample e for the attributes C and D respectively. In the current study, we assign 0.2 to h . determined according to the maximum membership principle, i.e., e k is believed to belong to a decision set Y j when the corresponding fuzzy membership degree  X  Y the decision sets; (2) any  X  X would be taken as zero for further computing. Fig. 1 depicts the membership function of the attribute pair  X  stiff  X  pliable example.
 D has been modi fi ed by each sample e k ,therealwaysexistsa Y j whose value j is the closest to d ( e k ) (the difference is smaller than 0.5), i.e.  X  Y 0 r FInc  X  X  e k D = X i  X  X  1 FInc  X  X  e k D = X i  X  X  r  X  1 attribute C with respect to the decision attribute D can be constituted as

Two attributes C and D are used to take measures on six representative samples in order to know how much the attribute C is included in D . The corresponding parameters of the previous computational proce-dure are: h  X  2, m  X  10, n  X  6.

FInc  X  X  e 1 D = X 0  X  X   X  6 way and the corresponding results are shown in Table 4 . Based on the previous results, the classi fi cation consistency of
X with respect to D is computed as follows:
Cons
Similarly, we obtain, Cons n  X  X 1 ; D  X  X  0 : 902, Cons n
Cons  X  X 3 ; D  X  X  0 : 868, Cons n  X  X 4 ; D  X  X  0 : 837, Cons n
Cons  X  X 6 ; D  X  X  0 : 815, Cons n  X  X 7 ; D  X  X  0 : 831, Cons n
Cons  X  X 9 ; D  X  X  0 : 892, Cons n  X  X 10 ; D  X  X  0 : 914.

Finally, for this decision table, the classi fi cation consistency of the condition attribute C with respect to the decision attribute D can be calculated by
CCons n  X  C ; D  X  X   X  10
It means that the classi fi cation result of C is rather consistent with that of D . We can consider that the attribute C is strongly included in D . 3. General inclusion degree 3.1. Ranking consistency (RCons)
The previous fuzzy classi fi cation consistency measure CCons  X  C ;
D  X  quanti fi es the extent to which the classi fi cation of the condi-tion attribute C is consistent with that of the decision attribute D . However, the ordinal consistency between the datasets is not well taken into consideration. For example, according to the idea of inclusion degree, the two classi fi cations,{(123)(45)}and{(321) (5 4)}, may have no difference, since according to the available two datasets are regarded as identical. But actually, in an information system, the element's different positions in the two sets may lead to big differences between the knowledge to be represented respec-tively. Therefore, it is meaningful to involve another index to measure the ordinal differences between the datasets obtained from different measuring systems. This index would work as a supplement to the classi fi cation consistency measure ( CCons n ). For this purpose, Kendall's rank coef fi cient is employed in our study ( Siegel, 1977 )asa rank consistency measure ( RCons ).

As a non-parametric measure of rank correlation, Kendall's tau depends upon the number of inversions of pairs of objects which would be needed to transform one rank order into the other. For the sample set U  X  { e 1 , e 2 , ... , e n }, C  X  ( c ( e ) ... d ( e 6 )) T are the condition dataset and decision dataset respec-tively. Kendall's rank correlation coef fi cient  X  or RCons ( C , D )is computed from
RCons  X  C ; D  X  X   X   X  C ; D  X  X  1 2 d  X   X  C where d  X   X  C ; D  X  X  X  number of concordant pairs  X  (number of dis-cordant pairs) denotes the symmetric difference distance between two C and D .

Notably, any two pairs of data  X  c  X  e i  X  ; d  X  e i  X  X  and  X  c  X  e considered to be concordant if the ranks for both elements agree to each other: i.e., if both c  X  e i  X  4 c  X  e j  X  and d  X  e c  X  e ered to be discordant, if c  X  e i  X  4 c  X  e j  X  and d  X  e c  X  e i  X  o c  X  e j  X  and d  X  e i  X  4 d  X  e j  X  . But if c  X  e i these pairs is neither concordant not discordant. 3.2. Combination of the consistency indices using fuzzy inference
In this study, an aggregation criterion ( AC ) was proposed to combine the previous two indices, CCons n and RCons ,soasto constitute a general inclusion measure ( GCons ) to investigate the overall inclusion relation of the condition attribute C to the decision attribute D . This criterion should be both robust to noises and easy for knowledge interpretation. For this purpose, a fuzzy inference system is designed and illustrated in Fig. 2 .Itisa classical operation with the Sugeno method ( Takagi and Sugeno, 1985 ), permitting to compute the output variable GCons from two input variables CCons n and RCons . This system consists of three major parts responsible for the fuzzi fi cation of input data, fuzzy application of the fuzzy rules in Table 5 , and defuzzi fi produce output data, respectively.

Fuzzy rules are crucial for building a fuzzy inference system. In the current study, these fuzzy rules are initially built according to several well recognized and application independent general principles. For example, one principle is: if both the classi and ranking results are very consistent in two datasets, then we consider that their general consistency is very high. Moreover, in order to obtain more reliable rules, we invited 6 experts (teachers in data analysis) to express their opinions about the relation of the general consistency of two datasets with the classi fi cation and ranking results. Table 5 shows the fi nal rules. In fact, by applying these fuzzy rules, GCons , as an aggregation of CCons n and RCons , can be more robust and easily controlled by human experience on data analysis.

 ranged from 0 to 1 according to the fuzzy membership function de fi ned for each input and output variable during the process of fuzzy inference. The membership function is illustrated in Fig. 3 . It is a commonly used function uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. constituted to investigate the extent to which one dataset can be included in another one, with both the fuzzy classi fi cation con-sistency and the ranking consistency taken into consideration. 4. Application to the problem of tactile/vision sensory substitution 4.1. Context of the application ogy ( Klatzky and Lederman, 2010; James and Kim, 2010; Newell, 2010 ), most of the tactile information in our daily life can be interpreted through human's visual perception, which is in accor-dance with our real-life experience. For any speci fi c object, we can judge its size, weight and even its texture without really touching it. In fact, our brain has a very sophisticated memory association mechanism permitting us to perceive the outside world in a multi-channel mode ( Bernard and Juan, 2005 ). For example, when we touch a fabric, its tactile information will be associated with the synchronized visual features and memorized simultaneously in our brain so as to create a so-called memory association. After this experience being repeated for a suf fi cient number of times in our daily contact, the memory association established between the tactile and visual perceptions of this fabric can be gradually strengthened. In this way, when we see or even just visualize this object again, the related tactile information will be recalled from the memory association.
 taken into account in many haptic systems for conducting surgical operations to distinguish the softness of organs ( Widmer and Hu, 2010 ) and navigating visually impaired people using tactile sensa-tion, which imitates directional information provided by a sighted guide ( Lahave and Mioduser, 2008 ).

Building a quantitative model of the tactile/vision inclusion relationship is particularly signi fi cant in e-shopping because it will permit to communicate tactile properties of products to consu-mers through static and dynamic visual representations shown on
Internet. On this premise, we are considering the possibility to identify the cooperative and compensatory mechanism between the multisensory information of textile products (concerning especially the tactile and visual perceptions), so as to provide our customers with the most close-to-real sense of fabric hand in a remote or virtualized environment (online shop, for instance). For this purpose, we have organized a number of sensory tests on a set of representative garment samples. In these tests, the tactile properties or fabric hands of these samples have been evaluated by a trained panel through both real-touch and visual representa-tions (in images or video clips). Next, we apply the proposed inclusion degree to the datasets obtained from the previous evaluations in order to quantitatively investigate the extent to which fabrics' tactile properties can be interpreted through visual representations. 4.2. Sensory data acquisition
Sensory evaluations of six fl ared skirts were conducted in three scenarios, denoting the real-touch, video and image conditions, respectively. The aim of these evaluations is to identify normalized sensory descriptors on fabric hand, so as to comparatively study the fabric hand information perceived from the three different experimental scenarios. Take sample 1 as an example, Fig. 4 shows its image representation consisting of eight photos from standar-dized angles.

We use the classical descriptive sensory evaluation method ( Stone and Sidel, 1993 ) in the sensory tests. In order to acquire a reliable sensory evaluation, every concerned technique and procedure should be clari fi ed, including the choice of sensory descriptors, evaluation gestures and scales, etc. The aim was to have these techniques or procedures recognized as standard sensory evaluation methods.

The evaluation procedures cover the preliminary work on the choice and de fi nition of each descriptor to be evaluated, the sen-sory evaluation techniques, time, evaluation scale and evaluation work order. In addition, a well-designed form will help make the evaluation tasks easier to be practiced.

A group discussion called  X  brainstorming  X  was launched among some professionals from textile industry to produce an exhaustive list of descriptors, among which some descriptors with ambiguous meaning or tending to express hedonic preference were screened out by a subsequent discussion. Then, after study-ing the literature ( Civille and Dus, 1990 ; Fabric Hand, 2007 ), 27 pairs of normalized descriptors were determined as the evaluation criteria in our study, which are listed in Table 6 .

For each tactile descriptor, a detailed explanation to both its de fi nition and the corresponding assessing gestures was deter-mined by referring to the literatures ( Bishop, 1996; Meilgaard et al., 1991 ) and especially, by carrying out a discussion among the experts. Here gives an example.
 Stiff  X  Pliable:
De fi nition : A fabric that is  X  stiff  X  is not easily bent, and is rigid and in fl exible.  X  Pliable  X  expresses the opposite meaning of
Gestures : To assess this attribute, the panelist holds the fabric between the thumb and the other four fi ngers of his/her most used hand; while moving the fabric back and forth, he/she assesses the resistance.

Also, an 11-point scale degreed from 0 to 10 was applied for the evaluation. In order to prevent miss-scoring, every point on the scale was well de fi ned semantically, as is shown in Table 7 .For example, if a sample was considered to be very stiff, then its value on the  X  stiff  X  pliable  X  should be 1, so on and so forth.
After training with the identi fi ed 27 sensory descriptors describing fabric tactile properties and the 11-point evaluation scale, the evaluators or panelists carried out three sensory tests, namely real-touch scenario, video scenario and image scenario in order to give an evaluation score to each sample for each scenario. After the above experiments, we have obtained, for each evalua-tion scenario, a matrix of sensory values, in which rows represent samples and columns descriptors or attributes. To be speci the real-touch, video and image scenarios, the corresponding data matrices are formalized as T , V , and I respectively as follows: T  X  I  X  4.3. Results of the general inclusion degree and analysis
As was mentioned previously, the visual observations are considered as the condition dataset, while the real-touch observa-tions as the decision dataset. Taking the real-touch observations as a standard reference, Fig. 5 illustrates the computed GCons results, with the solid line representing the video performance and the dash line representing the image performance.

On most of the descriptors (20 out of 27), the GCons values of both the video and image observations are higher than 0.7 (shown in dash-dot line), which indicates that an important part of the tactile properties can be well interpreted through some speci visual representations of the textile products being concerned.
It can be observed from the line shapes that on most of the descriptors the solid line has a more stable shape than the dash line with fewer fl uctuations, which indicates that the panelists in the video scenarios have more stable and accurate performance as compared with those in the image scenarios. This is in accordance with the statistics shown in Table 8 that the video observations have a higher mean value and lower standard deviation ( STDEV ) value than the image observations. Besides, Table 9 shows the descriptors with low inclusion degrees (marked by  X   X  ) detected from Fig. 5 (below the dash-dot line). It is found that the solid line has only three such points, while the dash line has four, which also means that the panelists in the video scenarios have a generally better assessing performance than those in the image scenarios.
For the left part of Fig. 5 , in which the descriptors concern fabric's internal textures (from D1 to D13), both the solid and dash lines have more and bigger fl uctuations implying that the panelists in both the video and image scenarios tended to encounter bigger dif fi perceiving these descriptors as compared with the others.
To be speci fi c, on the six descriptor pair  X  stretchy  X   X  (D6), low inclusion degrees are detected in both video and image scenarios. This observation indicates that the available video and image displays fail to well illustrate this speci fi c property. Besides, dynamic displays (video) of the skirts are found to be able to increase the assessing accuracy on properties concerning fabric's drape (D5) and wrinkle-resistance (D4).

For compression properties (D11, D12, D13), the video displays have advantage over the image ones on the evaluation of the descriptors like  X  springiness  X  (D12) and  X  fullness  X  (D13), but not on  X  softness  X  (D11), where both scenarios have satisfactory results. (D7, D8, D9 and D10), panelists in image scenarios have higher evalua-tion accuracy than those in video scenarios on  X  loose  X  tight  X  thin  X  thick  X  (D9). The possible reason is that static displays (image) can provide the assessors with a clearer and more stable reveal of the fabric properties which are more related to a careful visual perception.

However, on the other hand, for the descriptors concerning fabric's surface properties (from D14 to D23), the GCons values of both the video and image observations are higher than 0.7 and no big difference is detected in between on these 10 descriptors.
Similar results are obtained on the descriptors about material identi fi cation (from D24 to D27). From this an assumption could be made that although the panelists could not really touch the fabric, they are still able to perceive most of its surface properties with certainty, and well predict the material likelihood of this sample through either the video of image displays. More-over, dynamic and static visual perceptions can be considered as two complementary information sources and their combination will lead to a more complete representation of fabric tactile properties. 5. Conclusion
In this paper, a novel consistency degree is proposed to study the consistency of two datasets in order to determine if one physical measuring or human evaluation system can be completely or partly replaced by another one for a speci fi c collection of items. This method is initially developed according to the idea of the inclusion degree used in rough set theory to measure the classi fi cation consistency of two datasets. Next, in order to take into account neighboring relations of different data, usually lost by the classical classi fi cation procedure, this index is modi fi ed by introducing a fuzzy classi fi cation consistency to build a more robust and more accurate inclusion degree. Based on the so-called fuzzy inclusion degree, this approach can escape the need of a big database in many classical methods by investigating similarities through an insight into the data structure itself. As another important aspect of the proposed method, the ranking consistency between different data is examined by applying the non-parametric coef fi cient Kendall's tau.
Finally, a fuzzy inference system is designed to aggregate, in a robust way, both the classi fi cation consistency ( CCons consistency ( RCons ) to constitute a general inclusion measure ( GCons ) which is both robust to noises and easy for result inter-pretation. In the context of studying the consistency of two ordered datasets measured physically or evaluated by human evaluators, this method should be more ef fi cient than both classical statistical methods, which only consider correlation relations between data, and classical inclusion degrees, which only deal with partition of objects.

The proposed consistency degree has been validated by apply-ing it to study the consistency of tactile properties of a collection of fabric samples to their static and dynamic visual representa-con fi rmed that a big part of the fabric tactile properties in our daily life can be interpreted through some speci fi cally designed visual displays (in either video or image forms). Video displays seem to provide more comprehensive and accurate information about fabric hand than image displays. However, in a more general context, these two information sources are complementary and their combinations will lead to a better understanding of fabric tactile properties.

The framework developed in the current study has set an example to the standardized resolution of similar problems in thefuture.Theproposedmethodcanalsobeavailablein solving many other problems as long as they are concerned with difference analysis on multi ple-sourced data.
