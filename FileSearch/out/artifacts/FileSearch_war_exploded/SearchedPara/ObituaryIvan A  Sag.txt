 University of Washington Ivan Sag died on September 10, 2013, after a long illness. He is survived by his wife,
Stanford sociolinguistics professor Penny Eckert. In a career spanning four decades, he published over 100 articles and 10 books, centered on the theme of developing precise, implementable, testable, psychologically plausible, and scalable models of natural lan-guage, especially syntax and semantics.

University of Pennsylvania (1973) and a Ph.D. from MIT (1976), all in Linguistics. He held teaching positions at the University of Pennsylvania (1976 X 1979) and Stanford
University (1979 X 2013) where he was the Sadie Dunham Patek Professor in Humanities since 2008. In addition, he taught at ten LSA Linguistic Institutes (most recently as the
Edward Sapir Professor at the Linguistic Institute at the University of Colorado, Boul-der, in 2011), at five ESSLLIs, as well as in summer schools or other visiting positions at NTNU (Trondheim), Universit  X  e de Paris 7, Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht, the University of Rochester, the University of Chicago, and Harvard University. At Stanford he was a founding member of and active participant in the Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), which housed the HPSG and LinGO projects. He was also a key member of the group of faculty that developed and launched the Symbolic Systems program (in 1985) and was director of Symbolic Systems from 2000 X 2001 and 2005 X 2009.
Among other honors, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007 and named a Fellow of the Linguistic Society of America in 2008.
 thering what he understood to be the original Chomskyan enterprise. However, in the late 1970s, he broke with the Chomskyan mainstream because he felt it had abandoned central aspects of that original enterprise. Here X  X  how Sag told the story to Ta! magazine in 1993:
The result of Sag holding to the initial goals of generative grammar, even when mainstream syntax did not, has been an enormous boon for the field of computational linguistics. Whereas much mainstream work in theoretical syntax is neither explicitly formalized nor concerned with broad coverage, the frameworks that Sag was instrumental in helping to create (Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar, and Sign-Based Construction Grammar [Boas and
Sag 2012], but especially HPSG) are implementable and in fact implemented, and demonstrably scalable.
 Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG, a term coined by Sag), and in particular
Gerald Gazdar and Geoff Pullum, at the 1978 LSA Linguistic Institute. Gazdar and colleagues set out to show that English (and other natural languages) could in fact be described with context-free models, as Pullum and Gazdar (1982) had debunked all previous arguments against that claim. But more importantly Sag and his colleagues developing GPSG strove to be formally precise, in order to support valid scientific investigation. 1 The GPSG book (Gazdar et al. 1985) begins by throwing down the gauntlet: taught a course on GPSG at Stanford with Gazdar and Pullum. One of the students attending that course, Anne Paulson, was working at Hewlett-Packard Labs and saw the potential for using GPSG as the basis of a question answering system (with a database back-end). Paulson arranged a meeting between her boss, Egon Loebner, and Sag,
Gazdar, Pullum, and Tom Wasow, which led to a nearly decade-long project implement-ing a grammar for English and processing tools to work with it. The project included HP staff as well as Sag, Pullum, and Wasow as consultants, and Stanford and UC Berkeley students, including Mark Gawron, Carl Pollard, and Dan Flickinger.
 context of developing and implementing analyses, Sag and colleagues added inno-vations to the underlying theory until its formal basis was so different it warranted a new name. The new theory, laid out in Pollard and Sag 1987 and Pollard and Sag 1994, among others, came to be called Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). 2 HPSG synthesizes ideas from GPSG, Dependency Grammar (Hudson 1984), Categorial
Grammar (Wood 1993), Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan and Kaplan 1982), and even Government and Binding Theory (Chomsky 1981).
 ism, HPSG defines a flexible formalism (typed feature structures) in which different theories can be defined. This flexibility facilitates testing and synthesis of theoretical ideas developed in other frameworks. The stability of the formalism has been critical to the success of HPSG in computational linguistics, as it has allowed for the development of a variety of processing engines that interpret the formalism and thus can apply grammars to the tasks of parsing and generation (Uszkoreit et al. 1994; Carpenter and
Penn 1994; Makino et al. 1998; Copestake 2002; Callmeier 2002; Penn 2004; Crysmann and Packard 2012; Slayden 2012, inter alios ).
 multi-site machine translation project funded by the German government, for which
Sag headed up the English Grammar Project (1994 X 2000), later redubbed LinGO (Lin-guistic Grammars Online), at CSLI. The English grammar developed in that project (beginning actually in 1993) came to be known as the English Resource Grammar (Flickinger 2000, 2011). 2 The resource grammar idea builds on insights articulated in
Gawron et al. 1982, namely, that detailed syntactic and semantic analysis are a crucial component of natural language understanding (in addition to discourse and world knowledge processing) and that the grammar which does that analysis can and should be portable across domains.
 developed in the context of applications ranging from machine translation of dialogues regarding travel and appointment scheduling (Verbmobil; Wahlster 2000), automated customer service response (YY Technologies), machine translation of Norwegian hiking brochures (LOGON; Oepen et al. 2007), and grammar checking as part of a language arts instructional application (EPGY/Redbird; Suppes et al. 2012). The work of building a grammar such as this involves identifying phenomena in sentences from the domain of interest that the grammar does not yet account for, delimiting the phenomena, and developing and implementing analyses. Throughout the mid and late 1990s and into the early 2000s, the LinGO project at CSLI featured weekly project meetings led by
Flickinger, who would bring phenomena in need of analysis for discussion by the group, including Sag and Wasow as well as Ann Copestake, Rob Malouf, Stanford linguistics graduate students, and visitors to CSLI.
 pedic knowledge of theoretical literature pertaining to the phenomenon in question and key examples that had been identified and analyzed in that literature, to suggest analyses, as well as to invent on the spot further examples to illustrate differences in predictions of competing candidate analyses. Supporting his ability to do this was an unsurpassed command of the theory and the workings of the grammar written in it.
These meetings not only fed the development of the English Resource Grammar, but also formed an important point of contact between computational and theoretical work in HPSG, such that the  X  X en and paper X  theory remained responsive to computational concerns.
 velopment of Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al. 1995, 2005). Sag and colleagues designed MRS to meet the competing demands of expressive adequacy, grammatical compatibility, computational tractability, and underspecifiability. In other words, it is a computational semantic formalism that allows grammars like the En-glish Resource Grammar to make explicit exactly as much information about semantic predicate argument structure and quantifier and operator scope as is determined by sentence structure, leaving further ambiguity represented via underspecification rather than enumeration of, for example, the full set of possible quantifier scopings for each item.
 work on natural language processing between grammarians and those working on the software required to develop and deploy grammars in practical applications. In the late 1990s, Sag and others, notably Dan Flickinger, Stephan Oepen, Jun X  X chi Tsu-jii, and Hans Uszkoreit, began exploring ways to continue the collaboration past the end of the Verbmobil project. The result was the DELPH-IN consortium, continued to facilitate further exchange of ideas and joint development of software and grammars. As of 2013, DELPH-IN spans four continents and has developed open-source grammars (including some large scale ones) for many languages, all of which are interoperable with the same set of open-source processing (analysis and generation) tools.
 between linguistics and computational linguistics, Sag also built bridges between formal linguistics and psycholinguistics. Towards the end of his career, together with graduate students at Stanford, Sag turned his attention to developing a clearer understanding of the roles of processing and grammar in determining (un)acceptability.
Specifically, he argued that the unacceptability associated with phenomena such as  X  X sland constraints X  derives not from ungrammaticality but in fact from more general processing pressures (Staum and Sag 2008; Hofmeister and Sag 2010; Staum Casasanto, on grammatical theory has highlighted the importance of  X  X erformance-plausible competence grammar, X  namely, models of linguistic knowledge that can in fact be embedded in models of human language processing (Sag 1992; Sag and Fodor 1994;
Sag, Wasow, and Bender 2003; Sag and Wasow 2011). A key feature of HPSG that makes it  X  X erformance plausible X  is representation of grammatical information in a form that allows it to be combined flexibly with other grammatical information as well as extragrammatical information relevant to processing (e.g., general world knowledge, or information about the present situation perceived by the hearer) as that information becomes available. This form of grammatical description has been very influential in computational work on incremental processing models which explicitly account for the generation of upcoming grammatical structure (Jurafsky 1996; Hale 2001;
Levy 2008). 4 opportunity for hybridization, as early as 1993. When asked by Ta! magazine (in the same interview cited above) about connectionism, he replied: linguistics and especially linguistics would be complete without remarking on the energy and verve he brought to the social aspects of doing science: He had a keen understanding of the importance of community and communication in the doing of science, and worked tirelessly to promote both. He organized the first International
Conference on Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar in Columbus, Ohio, in 1993 in order to provide a forum for HPSG researchers scattered across the globe to exchange ideas; the 20th iteration of that conference was held in Berlin in 2013. But his notion of community extended beyond staid academic discourse: He also started the band
Dead Tongues with Geoffrey Nunberg in the early 1980s, and played keyboards in every iteration of that band (with ever-changing, but always linguistically motivated, membership) through the roof-raising performance at Ivan Fest at CSLI in April 2013.
He also organized the rental of sorority houses and the hiring of gourmet chefs for shared housing at every Linguistic Institute he attended. These opportunities for social engagement helped build the community, not just of HPSG researchers, but of linguists more generally, which in turn supports the lively exchange of ideas on which Sag thrived and to which he contributed so much.
