 With the proliferation of mobile communication networks, especially with the current 2.9 billion mobile subscriber numbers worldwide (490 million in China), information also beginning to shift their revenue strategies from just mobile phone calling services to include information services [2]. 
Basically, users can access mobile information services via their mobile phone X  X  embedded micro-browser or by using text/multimedia messaging (Short Message Ser-vice, SMS). In China, almost all users have the experience of sending short messages, and 1.1 billion messages are sent every day [3]. People are accustomed to writing short messages in natural language, so we developed natural language-based approach for accessing mobile information services. 
Although it is convenient for users to access information using natural language, it is difficult for a general natural language processing method [4] to achieve high accu-racy, especially when allowing users to query information from multiple domains in multiple languages. 
Firstly, it does not have enough domain-specific semantic knowledge, and there-lated queries with high accuracy. For example, when a user queries  X  X ow is the traf-fic near Silver Plaza? X , it is difficult for the system to understand that the user wants to query the traffic situation at Baofusi Bridge, if the system does not know that Bao-fusi Bridge is the nearest cong estion location to Silver Plaza. 
Secondly, it does not have enough domain-specific linguistic knowledge. There-fore it is difficult for it to understand flexible natural language queries from different users. Moreover, multilingual queries make the understanding even more difficult. 
This paper proposes a natural language processing method based on a Multi-domain &amp; Multilingual Ontology (MMO) and Multi-domain &amp; Multilingual Query Language (MMQL) to solve the above problems. 
To tackle the first problem, the MMO, constructed primarily in the spirit of Gru-ber X  X  view of ontologies [5], is developed to provide domain-specific semantic knowledge by conceptualizing multiple domains. The MMO consists of a group of domain ontologies to conceptualize various domains and a mapping ontology to con-nect the domain ontologies together organically. 
To tackle the second problem, the MMQL, a hierarchical query language based on the MMO, is developed to provide domain-specific linguistic knowledge. It can cover many natural language query forms by defining limited syntax, and parallel lingual syntax is also defined to process multilingual queries. 
Finally, with the MMO-and MMQL-based natural language processing method as MISP aims to enable mob ile users to access accurate multi-domain information any-time and anywhere, just by making multilingual natural language queries via short bus trip planning service, show that th is MISP can provide considerate commercial-level services to mobile users. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: An overview of related work is given in Section 2. Section 3 describes the archit ecture of the MISP. Section 4 describes the Multi-domain &amp; Multilingual Ontology (MMO). Section 5 explains the Multi-domain &amp; Multilingual Query Language (MMQL). Section 6 presents the natural language query processing engine. Section 7 outlines the implementation and evaluation of the MISP. Section 8 concludes the paper. There have been many efforts in system development for mobile information services. 
Keyword-based mobile search engines are commonly used by current systems, such as Google mobile search [7], Yahoo mobile search [8], and MSN mobile search [9], among others. Mobile devices have small displays, and mobile user interfaces are often less than optimally usable, because the above systems often directly impose the desktop web search paradigm on the mobile user. There are also some natural language-based mobile search engines, such as Ask-MeNow [10], Any Question Answered [11], and mInfo [12], among others. They can provide a more usable interface to users. 
However, looking through the related natural language-based mobile search en-gines, we find it is difficult to achieve a high rate of accurate understanding of flexi-ble natural language queries, without the help of human beings, because:  X  Most of them do not have enough domain-specific semantic knowledge. They  X  Most of them do not have enough domain-specific linguistic knowledge. Many of We designed the MISP (Mobile Information Service Platform, shown as Fig. 1, to provide natural language-based services. Furthermore, this platform was also de-signed in order to solve the two problems described in the previous sections. 
In the lower level of Fig. 1, it can be seen that domain-specific semantic knowl-edge and linguistic knowledge for processing users X  natural language queries through two methods: the Multi-domain &amp; Multilingual Ontology (MMO), and the Multi-domain &amp; Multilingual Query Language (MMQL), respectively. 
The MMO is necessary to provide semantic knowledge for natural language proc-essing. Firstly, semantic knowledge includes that from multiple domains, while dif-ferent sources may contain the knowledge in different languages, such as Chinese, English, and Japanese, etc. Therefore the MMO is needed to represent multi-domain and multilingual knowledge. Secondly, knowledge of different domains is not sepa-rate, and nor is the knowledge in different languages. There are some relevancies among different domains and languages, and the MMO is needed to map them to-gether in order to provide more effective semantic knowledge. So MMO is designed as a group of domain ontologies to represent multi-domain and multilingual knowl-edge and a mapping ontology to represent the relevancies among domain ontologies. 
The MMQL is necessary for flexible natural language query processing. Firstly, users often have different query forms for different domains, and the MMQL is needed to summarize the query forms of each domain. Secondly, there are some com-mon query features of different domains, and the MMQL is needed to extract them in order to reduce repeated definitions. So MMQL is designed as a group of domain query languages to summarize the query forms of each domain and a common query language to extract the common query features of multi-domains, and such a hierar-chical style can reduce repeated definitions. Furthermore, to process multilingual syntax and the corresponding syntax in English, Japanese, etc. 
In the middle level of Fig .1, a natural language query processing engine is de-picted. Based on the MMO and MMQL, the engine can process users X  flexible natural language queries and generate relative answers. Firstly, as the user can make a multi-guage type of the user query. Secondly, the query analysis module can understand flexible natural language queries. Thirdly, the information search and answer genera-tion module can find the appropriate information and generate answers for users, according to the above query analysis result. 
The top level of Fig .1 shows commercial-l evel services for mobile users. Using the natural language query processing engine provided by the middle level, an effec-trip planning service. 4.1 MMO Representation The MMO is used to provide semantic knowledge for natural language processing. It consists of a group of domain ontologies and a mapping ontology. The domain ontol-ogy is used to record semantic knowledge for each domain, and the mapping ontology is used to record the relations among the domain ontologies. The domain ontology and mapping ontology will now be explained in detail. 4.1.1 Domain Ontology The domain ontology is created separately for each domain, such as the location on-same time, the domain ontologies are defined as a parallel union of multiple lan-[5], and it is composed of a set of concepts that are connected with relations. In other tecting errors in these concepts and their re lations. Axioms can also be used to make inferences. The axioms are described by horn rules [13]. 
Fig. 2 presents examples of location ontology and congestion ontology, respec-tively. Location ontology comprises all roads (e.g. North Fourth Ring Road), bridges tions (e.g.  X  X etween (Baofusi Bridge, Xueyuan Bridge, Jianxiang Bridge) X  means Baofusi Bridge is located between Xueyuan Bridge and Jianxiang Bridge). Similarly, congestion ontology comprises all congestion locations (e.g. Baofusi Bridge), direc-tions (e.g. west to east) and traffic status descriptions (e.g. jammed). 4.1.2 Mapping Ontology Integrated information services require th e domain ontologies to be connected to-gether. So the mapping ontology, which saves the relation information among domain three kinds of relations used to make the mapping: (1) Expression mapping. The mapping is built among synonymous or abbreviated (2) Language mapping. The mapping is built among the same words that are de-(3) Geospatial mapping. The mapping is built among geospatial-related words. For 4.2 MMO Creation Domain ontology is created as a union of multiple languages from its information source. Location ontology, bus trip ontology and driving route ontology are automati-formation System (GIS). Congestion ontology is semi-automatically extracted from traffic reports, which comprise the traffic status descriptions of all places. 
Mapping ontology is created automatically. Firstly, we build the following data li-This comprises the words from each domain and corresponding synonymous expres-breviated expressions, especially in the Chinese language and the English language; (3) multilingual dictionary. This comprises the words from each domain and correspond-ing translations. Secondly, the mapping ontology is created automatically based on the above data libraries: (1) expression mapping is performed based on the synonymy dictionary and abbreviation rules; (2) language mapping is performed based on the multilingual dictionary, and the mapping among the words that have the same mean-performed based on the GIS functions, and the mapping among geospatial-related words is built automatically. 5.1 MMQL Representation The MMQL is used to provide domain-specific linguistic knowledge. It can cover many natural language query forms by defining limited syntaxes. The MMQL con-sists of a group of domain query languages and a common query language. The do-main query languages are built to summarize the query forms of each domain. The common query language is summarized to extract the common query features of multi-domains. It can be then inherited by various domain query languages. Such a hierarchical style can reduce repeated definitions through the inherit strategy. Fur-thermore, both the domain query language and common query language are defined as a parallel union of multiple languages. 5.1.1 Domain Query Language The domain query language is designed for each domain accordingly, such as the con-components: (2) The agent is represented as  X  X yntax(name)  X  QueryType(keywords) X , which 
Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b) present an example of congestion query and bus trip query language, respectively. If the query conforms to the syntax of  X  X raffic Query Between Points X , then the query semantic structure  X  X raffic(?Start, ?End) X  is generated, which semantic structure  X  X usPlanning(?Start, ?End) X  is generated, which means it obtains the bus route from  X ?Start X  to  X ?End X . 5.1.2 Common Query Language The common query language is designed by extracting the common query features of various domain query languages, and the domain query languages are redefined by inheriting from the common query language. The inherit strategy is implemented by instantiating appropriate parameters. 
As an example (see Fig. 5), we can extract the common query language from Fig.  X  X etweenPoints X  in Fig. 5. Then, the syntax of the congestion query language can be redefined as  X  X nherit BetweenPoints(?para1=traffic, ?para2=CongestionLocation, ? para3=  X  X  X  X  X  X | X  X  ) X , and the syntax of bus trip query language can be redefined as  X  X nherit BetweenPoints (?para1=bus, ?para2=BusStation, ?para3=  X  X | X  X  X  ) X . 5.2 MMQL Creation Currently, the MMQL is mainly built manually. Firstly, we analyze the common query features of various domains, and then build a hierarchical structure to show the ture, we define lingual syntaxes and agents in parallel for each node by the inheritance between higher-level syntax and lower-level syntax. The higher-level syntax is taken as the common query language, and the lower-level syntax is taken as the domain query language. As the common query language depends on the given set of domain query languages, when a new domain is added, the above manual process must be executed again to extend the MMQL. The MISP can take Chinese, English and Japanese queries within the domains of congestion information, location-related information, driving route planning and bus trip planning. Furthermore, in China, as per SMS limitations, almost all of the queries are under 70 characters. The natural language query processing engine can process these flexible queries and generate appropriate answers. It is developed based on the MMO and MMQL, and it includes the following three steps (as shown in Fig. 1): 
Firstly, as users may query in multi-languages, such as Chinese, English, Japanese, etc., the query language identification module identifies the language type of the user query by matching the query with MMO and MMQL. 
Secondly, the query analysis module finds the matched syntax in MMQL by a re-laxed keyword matching method. This means the method can transform the query pression mapping, language mapping and geospatial mapping in the mapping ontol-ogy of MMO. Through this method, the query analysis module can handle a flexible query from a mobile user. Finally, the module generates the corresponding query semantic structure by the agent definition of the matched syntax. 
Thirdly, the information search and answer generation module search for appropri-ate information and generate an answer, acco rding to the query semantic structure. Plaza? X  Firstly, the query is identified as English language, because  X  X raffic X ,  X  X rom X  and  X  X o X  are comprised in English syntax of MMQL and  X  X ianxiang Bridge X  and  X  X il-ver Plaza X  are denoted as English language by MMO. Secondly, the query is matched with the syntax of  X  X raffic Query Between Points X  that inherits from  X  X etween-Points X , where  X ?Start X  and  X ?End X  are  X  X ianxiang Bridge X  and  X  X ilver Plaza X  respec-tively. Because  X  X ilver Plaza X  cannot satisfy the corresponding constraint  X  X onges-tionLocation X , it is transformed into  X  X aofusi Bridge X  by the mapping information  X  X earCongestLocation(Silver Plaza, Baofusi Bridge) X . Then generates the corre-sponding query semantic structure  X  X raffic(Jianxiang Bridge, Baofusi Bridge) X . Thirdly, search traffic reports and generate the answer  X 9:59 Jianxiang Bridge to Bao-fusi Bridge, west to east, traffic slow X . 7.1 Implementation As shown in Fig. 6, the implementation of the MISP consists of 5 components: (1) Information Sources, including traffic re ports, WebPages, etc. They provide the (2) Content Providers, who provide basic info rmation for the service, such as a con-(3) Mobile Users, who query information via SMS. (4) Mobile Operators such as China Mobile and China Unicom. They transmit que-(5) Service Providers, which are the key component of the MISP. They work between Currently, we have developed: (1) A Multi-domain &amp; Multilingual Ontology (MMO), which comprises four domain (2) A Multi-domain &amp; Multilingual Query Language (MMQL), which comprises the (3) Four trial services: the traffic congestion information service, location-related 7.2 Experiment 1: Accuracy Evaluation Because the inputs to MISP are natural language queries, the first experiment was Accuracy of query processing, and this was used to evaluate the ability to understand various queries. (2) Accuracy of answer generation, and this was used to evaluate the ability to generate correct answers. We correspondingly defined two types of accura-cies as follows: 
We selected a test set that comprises 1,500 queries (500 for Chinese, 500 for Eng-tion-related information service, driving route planning service, and bus trip planning 2000 Chinese queries and 2000 Japanese queries. As these services had already been launched in China, we were able to gather these different types of queries from real-life users. 
Twenty users were required to check the query semantic structure and answer for each query and give their evaluations ( X  X atisfied X  or  X  X nsatisfied X ), and then the above accuracies were calculated based on the users X  evaluations. 
Table 1(a) gives the multi-domain query processing evaluation results, which show 93.6~94.1% query accuracy and 94.7~96.8% answer accuracy achieved for the four errors were identified: (1) User errors, which were generated in the query by the user himself, e.g., incomplete query, semantic error or spelling error in the query; and (2) appropriately, e.g., due to an unrecognized word or unrecognized syntax in the query. 
Table 1(b) gives the multilingual query processing evaluation results, which show 92.4~95.2% query accuracy and 94.7~95.9% answer accuracy achieved for the three languages. In examining the queries that were not answered appropriately, besides accuracy of English query processing is higher than Chinese and Japanese, because Chinese and Japanese queries are often more flexible. 7.3 Experiment 2: Performance Evaluation The second experiment was used to examine the performance of the MISP. We de-ployed the MISP on a HP DL580 server with 2200MHz CPU X 4 and 4GB memory. Then we used the 6000 queries from Experiment 1, repeated 10 times (60,000 queries in all), as a performance test. The scalability and response time evaluations are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that the driving route planning service performed the worst because it requires geographical computin g using the GIS function, which is time-performance, shown in Table 2, was good enough for the real service. Multi-domain &amp; Multilingual Ontology (MMO) and Multi-domain &amp; Multilingual Query Language (MMQL). The MMO can provide domain-specific semantic knowl-edge, and the MMQL can provide domain-specific linguistic knowledge. With the help of the MMO and MMQL, the MISP can process users X  flexible natural language que-ries with higher accuracy. Experiments on a traffic congestion information service, location-related information service, driving route planning service, and bus trip plan-ning service show that the MISP can provide considerate commercial-level services to mobile users. Furthermore, these services have been already launched in China.
