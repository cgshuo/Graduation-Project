 We present a framework for automatically summarizing social understanding large scale online so cial networks, which have diverse social interactions and e xhibit temporal dynamics. In this work we construct summarization by extracting activity themes. We propose a novel unified temporal multi-graph framework for extracting activity themes over tim e. We use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approach to derive two interrelated latent spaces for users and concepts. Activity themes are extracted from the derived latent spaces to construct group activity summary. Experiments on real-world Flickr datasets demonstrate that our technique outperforms baseline algor ithms such as LSI, and is additionally able to extract temporally representative activities to construct meaningful group activity summary.

Networks such as Flickr, Facebook and Myspace, allow for a diverse range of interactions amongst their members, resulting in large, tem poral datasets relating users, media objects and actions. Auto matic summarization of this collective activity will create great values: End users can make better use of shared media within their social groups. Business analysts can begin to understand the collective decision-making behavior in a group for marketing purposes. Finally, social science researchers can use the summary as a framework to understand how ideas emerge and diffuse. The problem is highly challenging since the social netw ork activity changes rapidly over time, the interactions between us ers can have different semantics and finally due to the scale of the problem. Recently, there has been work on analysis of social groups and their temporal dynamics [4], including mining the community network dynamics [5]. These works focus on dynamic but homogeneous networks, i.e. th e edges represent homogeneous actions (e.g. posting). However in online social networks users can interact with each other though heterogeneous actions which have different semantics. Heter ogeneous interrelated entities have attracted considerable interests r ecently [1,6,7]. It has been shown that combining multiple relationshi ps such as the linkage and the document-term matrices is effective in text mining [8]. These multi-graph mining algorithms do not consider the temporal evolution of the interrelated entities. To summarize the dynamics and richness of social activity, we propose a unified temporal multi-graph framework for extracting activity themes over time. Experiments on real-world Flickr datasets demonstrate that our technique outperforms baseline algor ithms such as LSI/SVD, and is additionally able to extract temporally representative activities to construct meaningful group activity summary. We propose a novel method for auto matically summarizing social group actions over time. The major contribution in this work is two-folded, including a new summarization methodology and a unified mining algorithm. The basic unit of analysis is an activity triple  X  user , concept and action . The concepts in our work refer to tags associated with photos e.g.  X  X each, X   X  X ome. X  An activity theme for a group is a set of co-occurring activities for a certain time. Example activity themes include (also ref. Figure 1):  X   X  X n October 2007, Alex, Becky and Colleen post photos  X   X  X n November 2007, Alex, Daren and Eric comment on The summarization methodology id entifies who (users), what (concepts), how (actions) and when (time) to represent the collective activities. We believe these are necessary aspects for understanding the collective activity in a social group. Our methodology is complementary to the concept summarization approach, e.g. tag cloud representation [3]. We propose a unified temporal multi-graph algorithm for extracting activity themes over time. Our algorithm differentiates

 action semantics by the type and the co-occurring time of actions. We combine four different netw orks (user-photo, user-comment, photo-tag, and comment-tag matri ces) that represent different semantics of user actions. We use a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approach to derive two interrelated latent spaces for users and concepts, where users and concepts are related to each other through different actions. We introduce time indicators (photo-time and comment-time matrices) as regulizer to enforce the temporal co-occurrence of actions. We provide an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the proposed objective function. Then, activity themes are extracted from the derived latent spaces to construct group activity summary. An example of the visual representation of group activity summary is shown in Figure 2. Theme extraction. For each activity theme A t at time t , we find a set of users, concept terms and actions as representative activities for A t . We extract the top K users and terms from the solution matrices given by the matrix factorization, and then extract the observable actions among the top K users and terms. Theme evolution. To determine how a theme evolves into another theme, we compute the similarity between themes by comparing the corresponding axes in both latent spaces. We use a cosine similarity measure to compare two axes. A visual representation of theme e volution can be constructed as a spiral map, as shown in Figure 2(b). Each bubble represents an activity theme A t , with size representing the amount of activities during t . Two adjacent themes A t , A t +1 are connected by an arrow with distance proportional to the dissimilarity between A When a bubble is highlighted, the corresponding activity theme (Figure 2(d)) and related photos (Figure 2(e)) are shown. The visual representation help understand the collective social activity in a group. From the ex ample shown in Figure 2(d), the users can easily observe that in Q4-2006, some users like  X  X kooo X  and  X  X hamufilth X  posted  X  X plus hphoto X  and got comments from others (e.g.  X  X sguys X ). We conduct extensive experiment s using real-world datasets collected from a popular photo-sharing site, Flickr. We select 191 public Flickr groups and extract all users, tags, photos and comments for each group. The Flic kr  X  X roups X  are used as a proxy for a realm of a social space. We evaluate the quality of temporal group activity summarization based on two criteria, coverage a nd coherence, which are defined based on the topological relationship between the extracted activities and the total activities. We compare our method with frequency based algorithms,  X  X nterestingness X  measure [3] and the well-known latent semantic indexing method (LSI) [2]. Ou r method outperform baseline methods: the users extracted by baseline methods cover 23-64% of concepts that have appeared in this group, while our method has significant improvement with a coverage of 38-70%  X  our improvement is 27.2% on the aver age. Our method differentiates users/concepts by the types and times of actions, so the extracted users are diversely related to more different concepts. The results also suggest that our method give s a more coherent summary than baseline methods. Our method out performs all baseline methods by consistently increasing the c onnections of extracted users and concept terms over time. This is because the users and concepts extracted by our method are based on their connections across different times, while other met hods only consider the connection for a given time. We propose a method for summari zing and representing social group activity over time. In our framework, we formulate the summarization problem as extraction of representative activity themes. This summarization framewo rk help identify who (users), what (concepts), how (actions) and when (time) to represent the collective activities. We use a la rge collection of real-world datasets to show the effectiven ess of our method. The reulsts demonstrate that our method is ab le to construct representative and meaningful group activity summary.

(a) An activity theme is represented by a bi-partite graph, where the left-side nodes represent users, the right-side nodes represent concept terms, bl ue edges represent  X  X ost-on X  actions, and red edges represent  X  X omment-on X  actions. (b) The theme evolution is represented by a spiral map, where each bubble represents an activity theme. Consecutive activity themes are connected by an arrow with distance indicating the difference of two themes. When a bubble is highlighted, the corresponding activity theme (d) and related photos (e) are shown.
