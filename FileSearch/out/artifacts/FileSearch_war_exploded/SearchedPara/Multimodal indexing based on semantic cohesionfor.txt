 Abstract This paper introduces two novel strategies for representing multimodal images with application to multimedia image retrieval. We consider images that are composed of both text and labels: while text describes the image content at a very high semantic level (e.g., making reference to places, dates or events), labels provide a mid-level description of the image (i.e., in terms of the objects that can be seen in the image). Accordingly, the main assumption of this work is that by combining information from text and labels we can develop very effective retrieval methods. We study standard information fusion techniques for combining both sources of information. However, whereas the performance of such techniques is highly competitive, they cannot capture effectively the content of images. Therefore, we propose two novel representations for multimodal images that attempt to exploit the semantic cohesion among terms from different modalities. Such representations are based on distributional term representations widely used in computational linguistics. Under the considered representations the content of an image is modeled by a distribution of co-occurrences over terms or of occurrences over other images, in such a way that the representation can be considered an expansion of the multimodal terms in the image. We report experimental results using the SAIAPR TC12 benchmark on two sets of topics used in ImageCLEF competitions with manually and automatically generated labels. Experi-mental results show that the proposed representations outperform significantly both, stan-dard multimodal techniques and unimodal methods. Results on manually assigned labels provide an upper bound in the retrieval performance that can be obtained, whereas results with automatically generated labels are encouraging. The novel representations are able to capture more effectively the content of multimodal images. We emphasize that although we have applied our representations to multimedia image retrieval the same formulation can be adopted for modeling other multimodal documents (e.g., videos).
 Keywords Multimedia image retrieval Image annotation Distributional term representations Semantic cohesion modeling 1 Introduction Nowadays images are one of the main sources of information available preceded only by text; this fact is due to the availability of inexpensive image registration (e.g., photographic cameras and cell phones) and data storage devices (large volume hard drives), which have given rise to the existence of millions of digital images stored in many databases around the world. However, stored information is useless if we cannot access the specific data we are interested in. Thus, the development of effective methods for the organization and exploration of image collections is a crucial task.

Image retrieval has been an active research area for over two decades (Smeulders et al. 2000 ; Goodrum 2000 ; Datta et al. 2008 ; Liu et al. 2007 ; Lew et al. 2006 ; Rui et al. 1999 ). However, despite the substantial advances that have been achieved so far, most of the reported work focuses on methods that consider a single information modality (i.e., either image or text), limiting the effectiveness and applicability of such methods. On the one hand, text-based methods are unable to retrieve images that are visually similar to a query image. On the other hand, image-based techniques cannot retrieve relevant images to queries that involve non-visual information (e.g., about places, events or dates). Further, visual methods present additional complications; for example, the need of specifying query images, providing relevance feedback and, more importantly, the ambiguity on deter-mining the underlying user information need from a sample image.

Because of the above limitations, in the last few years there has been an increasing interest from the scientific community in the study and development of retrieval techniques that incorporate both visual and textual information (Liu et al. 2007 ; Clough et al. 2007 ; Grubinger et al. 2008 ; Arni et al. 2009 ; Westerveld 2004 ; Aly et al. 2007 ). Most researchers that adopt the latter approach attempt to exploit the complementariness and diversity of information from different modalities available in multimodal image collections. Despite the fact that such approach seems logical and intuitive, it is not easy to develop multimodal methods that can yield satisfactory retrieval results. Moreover, current techniques fail at exploiting the availability of multimodal information for effectively representing the con-tent of images.

Another current research trend is on the development and usage of automatic image annotation (AIA) techniques for overcoming the limitations of content-based image retrieval (CBIR). The goal of AIA techniques is to provide images with labels so that users can search for images by using keywords (Datta et al. 2008 ; Barnard et al. 2003 , 2008 ; Jeon et al. 2003 ; Escalante et al. 2011 ). Usually, a set of labeled images are used as training set for learning algorithms that attempt to learn a mapping between visual features, extracted from the images, and labels. AIA labels can be considered an intermediate modality between visual and textual information (Hare et al. 2006 ) and, therefore, it is worthwhile studying the benefits offered by this modality into the multimedia image retrieval task. However, AIA labels have been barely used in combination with other modality for image retrieval (Ah-Pine et al. 2008 ; Escalante et al. 2008a , 2009 ). Thus, the usefulness of AIA labels in multimedia image retrieval has not been studied; in this work we consider images that are composed of text and AIA labels and study the benefits offered by AIA labels into multimedia image retrieval. 1.1 Our approach This paper introduces two novel techniques for representing multimodal images with application to multimedia image retrieval. In the considered setting, an image is described by both, textual information assigned to the image as a whole, and labels that are asso-ciated with regions in the image (see Fig. 1 ). The proposed strategies attempt to exploit the semantic cohesion as provided by labels and text for obtaining image representations that can effectively capture their semantic content. The representations we propose are based on distributional term representations (DTRs) in which terms are represented by a distri-bution of either co-occurrences over terms or occurrences over other images. Accordingly, in our proposal a multimodal document (an image in our case) is represented by a com-bination of the DTRs corresponding to the terms appearing in the document (i.e., the representation for a document is a distribution itself). In this way the representation for a document captures second order dependencies between terms and documents, which results in better retrieval performance. Also, the proposed representations allow us to search for images by using either labels, text, or combinations of both modalities.
We adopted the vector space retrieval model (VSM) with the proposed representations, although several other retrieval techniques can be used as well. We report experimental results on the SAIAPR TC12 1 collection, a benchmark database for the evaluation of multimedia image retrieval techniques. For comparison we also developed several baseline techniques for combining labels and text. Experimental results show that the baselines are very competitive, outperforming unimodal techniques; however, the novel representations obtain better performance than the standard information-fusion techniques. Furthermore, the proposed strategies are able to capture the content of images more effectively, moti-vating further research in several aspects. 1.2 Considered scenario We consider images that are described by text and labels as shown in Fig. 1 . Text is manually assigned by users and usually refers to the high-level semantic content of the image; for example, making reference to places, events, dates, etcetera (see Fig. 1 a, c). Labels or concepts, on the other hand, are derived from the image itself; they can be assigned manually or generated by AIA techniques and commonly make reference to visual aspects of the image (see Fig. 1 b, d); specifically, we consider as labels the names of the objects 2 that can be seen in images.

Since we are interested on studying whether or not the use of AIA labels can offer benefits to multimedia image retrieval, we consider manually assigned labels for most of our experiments. In this way, our results represent an upper bound in the performance that can be obtained with AIA labels. Nevertheless, we also perform experiments with labels generated with a state-of-the art AIA technique.

One should note that up to now the use of labels generated with AIA methods has been restricted to collections that lack any textual description. However, the main hypothesis of this work is that labels can also be helpful for collections that already have an associated textual description. Our hypothesis is based on the fact that both modalities offer infor-mation at different semantic levels that is complementary 3 and redundant 4 at the same time (see Fig. 1 ). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that we can exploit this multimodal infor-mation to develop effective multimedia image retrieval methods.

In the following we focus on methods for representing multimodal images that contain terms from two information modalities, namely, text and labels. Whereas this is a very specific scenario, the methods described herein are applicable to multimodal documents described by other types of terms and using more than two modalities. For example, documents described by text and phonetic codes (Reyes et al. 2011 ), multimodal images described by visual terms (i.e., textons (Winn et al. 2005 )), labels and text; or video described by terms from automated speech recognition transcripts, visual terms and con-cept detectors (Snoek et al. 2006 ; Larson et al. 2009 ; Kraaij et al. 2006 ). Therefore, despite the fact we face a particular multimodal problem, our methods can be used similarly in several domains and applications. In future work we will explore the application of our methods into other multimodal tasks. Note that whereas text and labels belong to the same information media, we consider them as belonging to different modalities because text and labels are obtained from two different sources of information. 1.3 Contributions The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:  X  We introduce two novel representations for multimodal images based on DTRs and use  X  We propose the combination of labels obtained via AIA with textual descriptions, 1.4 Structure of the paper The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section presents related work on multimedia image retrieval. Section 3 describes the multimedia image retrieval setting we consider and presents baseline techniques for combining information from labels and text.

Section 7 presents the conclusions derived from this work and outlines future work directions. 2 Related work The multimedia image retrieval task has been mainly faced with information fusion tech-niques that attempt to combine visual and textual information (Goodrum 2000 ; Datta et al. 2008 ; Rui et al. 1999 ; Clough et al. 2007 ; Grubinger et al. 2008 ; Arni et al. 2009 ; West-erveld 2004 ; Escalante et al. 2008a , 2009 ; Westerveld et al. 2000 ; Raicu 2006 ; Escalante et al. 2008b ; Chua et al. 1994 ; Ishikawa et al. 1998 ; La et al. 1998 ; Sclaroff et al. 1999 ; Elworthy 2000 ; Inoue and Ueda 2005 ; Hoi et al. 2005 ; Peinado et al. 2005 ; Jones and McDonald 2005 ; Mart X   X  nez-Ferna  X  ndez et al. 2005 , 2006 ; Adriani and Framadhan 2005 ; Izquierdo-Bevia  X  et al. 2005 ; Chang et al. 2005 ; Mart X   X  n-Valdivia et al. 2005 ; Besancon and Millet 2006 ; Chang and Chen 2006 ; Curtoni 2006 ; Maillot et al. 2006 ; Rahman et al. 2006 ; Lestari-Paramita et al. 2009 ). Visual information is incorporated through vectors of visual features that are extracted from images, whereas text is incorporated through vectors of occurrence statistics.

Feature vectors have been usually combined through late fusion (LF) or early fusion (EF) techniques. The LF approach to multimedia image retrieval consists of running several unimodal retrieval methods (either textual or visual) and combining their outputs to obtain a single list of ranked images (documents) per query (Westerveld 2004 ; Escalante et al. 2008b ; Peinado et al. 2005 ; Izquierdo-Bevia  X  et al. 2005 ; Besancon and Millet 2006 ; Chang and Chen 2006 ; Rautiainen and Seppdnen 2005 ; Rautiainen et al. 2004 ; Snoek et al. 2005 ). Because of its simplicity and its effectiveness, LF is one of the most used techniques for information fusion in general (Shu and Taska 2005 ), although a disadvantage of this method is that it may be inefficient as several retrieval methods must be run for each query. Usually a single method is used per modality (Peinado et al. 2005 ; Izquierdo-Bevia  X  et al. 2005 ; Besancon and Millet 2006 ; Chang and Chen 2006 ; Rautiainen et al. 2004 ), although the use of multiple and heterogeneous techniques has been also studied (Escalante et al. 2008b ).

The EF formulation, on the other hand, consists of merging the vectors corresponding to textual and visual information beforehand and then using a straight retrieval technique (Rautiainen et al. 2004 ; Rautiainen and Seppdnen 2005 ; Snoek et al. 2005 ; Westerveld 2000 ; van Gemert 2003 ; Escalante et al. 2009 ). In its basic form, EF consists of concat-enating the vectors of textual and visual features. For example, Cascia et al. and S. Sclaroff et al. concatenated color and texture attributes with the representation for text as obtained with latent semantic indexing (La et al. 1998 ; Sclaroff et al. 1999 ). Westerveld and van Gemert adopted a similar approach, although they applied dimensionality reduction techniques to the heterogeneous vectors for compressing the multimodal information (Westerveld 2000 ; van Gemert 2003 ). Similar approaches are reported in (Rautiainen et al. 2004 ; Rautiainen and Seppdnen 2005 ; Snoek et al. 2005 ). Compared to LF, EF can be more efficient as a single retrieval stage is performed, however, the dimensionality in which EF methods may work can be huge.

The most popular method for multimedia image retrieval in the last few years is the so called inter-media (pseudo) relevance feedback (IRF) technique (Clough et al. 2007 ; Grubinger et al. 2008 ; Ah-Pine et al. 2008 ; Escalante et al. 2008a , 2009 ; Chang and Chen 2006 ; Chang et al. 2005 ; Lestari-Paramita et al. 2009 ; Clinchant et al. 2007 ; Ah-Pine et al. 2009a , b ). IRF consists of two retrieval stages using two information modalities, say X and Y , where it is possible that X = Y . In the first stage, documents and query are represented under the modality X ; the top k 0 retrieved documents are considered to build a new query, which is created by processing the information in modality Y from the k 0 documents. Next, the just created query is used for the second retrieval stage considering documents rep-resented under modality Y . Intuitively, this method switches between modalities with the goal of improving the retrieval performance of unimodal methods. Satisfactory results have been reported with weighted versions of this technique (Clough et al. 2007 ; Grubinger et al. 2008 ; Ah-Pine et al. 2008 ; Chang et al. 2005 ; Chang and Chen 2006 ; Clinchant et al. modalities.

Other formulations that have been adopted are based on query expansions (Ishikawa et al. 1998 ) or incorporate user relevance feedback (Rui et al. 1998 ; Zhang et al. 2005 ); other methods have faced the retrieval problem as a supervised (Bradshaw 2000 ; Grangier et al. 2006 ; Grangier and Bengio 2006 ) or semi-supervised learning task (Cox et al. 2000 ; Zhou et al. 2006 ). Westerveld proposed a combination of independent Gaussian mixture models (one for each modality) for representing multimodal images; image retrieval was performed by estimating the (combined) probability for a query to be generated by the model of each document (Westerveld 2004 ). Also, traditional retrieval methods (e.g., VSM or latent semantic indexing) have been modified to incorporate visual information (West-erveld et al. 2000 ; Raicu 2006 ; Inoue and Ueda 2005 ). Satisfactory results have been obtained with the latter methods; however, these approaches are either based on specific assumptions or the data they consider are difficult to obtain, hence the applicability of such methods is limited. 2.1 Discussion The above described methods present a common limitation: they do not exploit the association among multimodal terms to obtain better representations of images, which also limits the retrieval performance of these methods. Current methods work with the indi-vidual modalities separately and in some stage of their processes merge the unimodal information. Thus, in traditional approaches the representation of a multimodal image is always a combination of two unimodal representations. Even though acceptable perfor-mance has been obtained with such strategies, we believe that the interactions between terms from different modalities can reveal useful information about the content of images. Therefore, the possible dependencies between terms from different modalities must be considered for representing multimodal images. The methods we propose are based on this idea.

In this work we propose two novel representations that attempt to exploit the multi-modal term association with the goal of obtaining better representations for multimodal images. The proposed techniques are based on distributional term representations (DTRs) that have not been previously used for image retrieval. Carrillo et al. 2009 have previously studied the use of DTRs (in combination with other techniques) for textual information retrieval; results reported by Carrillo et al. by using the DTRs alone are rather poor. In this work we were able to obtain acceptable results with DTRs for multimedia image retrieval.
One should note that all of the above referred methods have been designed to combine visual and textual features. However, in this work we develop methods that combine labels and text. Despite the fact that we are implicitly fusing visual (i.e., labels are derived from processed visual data) and textual information, in our formulation images are described with information from a higher semantic level, (see Hare et al. 2006 ) for a categorization of the semantic levels by which an image can be described). We believe that this approach is advantageous because the information to fuse lies in modalities that are closer in their level of semantics (Hare et al. 2006 ), thus facilitating its combination.

The use of labels for image retrieval has been studied for a while (Barnard et al. 2003 , 2008 ; Jeon et al. 2003 ; Hare et al. 2006 ; Allan and Verbeek 2009 ; Carneiro et al. 2007 ), however, labels have been mostly used for content-based image retrieval (i.e., a unimodal formulation). There are a few works that have considered the combination of labels and text for image retrieval, see for example (Ah-Pine et al. 2008 ; Escalante et al. 2008a ). In Escalante et al. ( 2008a ) labels automatically assigned to images were used to expand their textual descriptions. To the best of our knowledge this was the first reported evidence on the usefulness of labels for improving the image retrieval performance of text-based methods. Instead of expanding documents, in this work we evaluate the advantages of using labels and text to represent images. More importantly, we propose two novel rep-resentations that resulted very effective for multimedia image retrieval. In Ah-Pine et al. ( 2008 ), Escalante et al. ( 2008b ) the authors also studied the combination of labels, gen-erated with visual concept detectors, with other information sources, however, results were not encouraging; the latter can be due to the limited content-coverage of the 17 concepts that were considered.

In the video retrieval domain, the use of visual concept detectors has been widely studied in the framework of the TRECVID forum (Kraaij et al. 2006 ). In that forum visual concept detectors are used to associate video shots with a probability distribution over all of the considered concepts, which indicates how likely is each concept to be present in the shot. Such information has been combined with text obtained by automatic speech rec-ognizers over the audio extracted from the video (Kraaij et al. 2006 ; Aly et al. 2009 ). The latter approaches are highly relevant to our work, although, there are several differences to take into account. Firstly, concepts considered in video retrieval are far more general (e.g., sports, military, explosion ) than those used in image retrieval, even some concepts refer to information that is not visually present in the image (e.g., monologue, entertainment ) (Snoek et al. 2006 ). Secondly, concepts in video retrieval are associated to the video frame as a whole (Aly et al. 2007 , 2009 ; Snoek et al. 2006 ; Kraaij et al. 2006 ). In contrast, in this work we consider labels attached to regions in images. Thirdly, we consider a scenario in which labels either occur or not in documents, whereas in video retrieval, it is considered a probability distribution over all concepts. In future work we would like to explore the use of our methods for video retrieval tasks.
 A highly related work from the video retrieval community is that by Boldareva and Hiemstra, where a probabilistic interactive retrieval approach is proposed (Boldareva and Hiemstra 2004 ). As one of the DTRs we consider (see Sect. 4 ), the authors of the latter paper consider an indexing model where documents are represented by its (unimodal) associations with other documents. In the work of Boldareva and Hiemstra associations are probabilities derived from visual similarity measurements, while in this work the associ-ations are given by term co-occurrence statistics. Using co-occurrence statistics makes possible to estimate associations among documents according to terms from different modalities. 3 Baseline methods: combining text and labels We face the problem of representing images that are composed of terms that belong to one of two different vocabularies. Specifically, we consider multimodal images that can be composed of terms taken from either a vocabulary of labels (L) or a vocabulary of text (T).
As baseline unimodal representation we consider the widely used tf-idf indexing scheme where a document is represented by a vector of term occurrence statistics (Salton et al. 1975 ; Salton and Buckley 1987 ). Specifically, the i th element of the vector representing document j according to modality X is given by: where tf X ( i , j ) is the number of occurrences of term i from the modality X in docu-ment j ; N D is the number of documents in the collection and N i X denote the number of documents in which term i appears. Vectors are normalized using cosine normalization: d similar way. Thus, q X denotes the corresponding tf-idf representation for a query in modality X . For retrieving documents the query vector and every document in the col-lection are compared via the cosine similarity: documents are sorted in descending order of S X ( q X , d j X ) and the top -k are shown to the user.

The above representation can be used to search images by using a single modality: either text ( X = T ) or labels ( X = L ). For combining both sources of information we consider the three most frequently used techniques for information fusion in information retrieval, namely: late fusion, early fusion and inter-media relevance feedback. These techniques are not new, however, this is the first work in which such techniques are used to combine information from labels and text. In the rest of this section we describe the standard information fusion techniques used. 3.1 Late fusion (LF) Under this approach the outputs of multiple unimodal retrieval models (usually from different modalities) are combined to obtain a new ranking of the documents for each query. LF has reported satisfactory performance in this task by combining the outputs of visual and textual methods; however, it can be inefficient because it requires running multiple retrieval models for each query.

For combining labels and text we consider the following LF formulation. Given queries in both modalities, we retrieve documents separately by using the unimodal VSM sponding to documents retrieved with labels and text, respectively. Each document d j that appears in the union of lists l T and l L , is assigned a score that depends on the position in the lists in which the document appears and on the number of lists in which the document appears. The weight for each document is thus assigned as follows: where W  X  d j  X  is the relevance weight for document j under LF; h ( l X , d y ) is the inverse of the l ; m 2f 1 ; 2 g is the number of lists in which document d j appears; a L and a T are scalars that weight the contribution of each of the considered modalities. The weight in Eq. ( 3 )is computed for every document and the ranked documents (in descending order) are shown to the user. This form of fusion resembles the CombMNZ method (Fox and Shaw 1994 ), one of the most widely used in information retrieval (Shu and Taska 2005 ; Farah and Vanderpooten 2007 ). Where we assume that the inverse of the position of a document in a list is proportional to the similarity of the document to the corresponding query. We consider this specific formulation because in previous work we have obtained satisfactory results in multimedia image retrieval with it (Escalante et al. 2008b , 2009 ). 3.2 Early fusion (EF) Under this scheme, the unimodal representations in both modalities as obtained with Eq. ( 1 ) are concatenated as follows: where d j LT is the merged representation of document d j , a L and a T are scalars that weight the contribution of each modality. Documents and queries are represented as described in Eq. ( 4 ). Then the cosine distance is used to rank documents. One should note that in order to obtain satisfactory results with EF under the VSM, the representations for the document in each modality should be comparable (i.e., they must account for similar statistics and must be properly normalized); otherwise, Eq. ( 2 ) may be uninformative for computing similarity.
 3.3 Inter-media relevance feedback (IRF) While LF and EF can be considered traditional approaches to multimedia image retrieval, IRF is a recently proposed strategy that has proved to be very effective (Chang et al. 2005 ; Ah-Pine et al. 2009b ). IRF is based on the widely adopted technique of relevance feedback (Rui et al. 1998 ), where users mark relevant images after an initial retrieval stage and using such information a second retrieval stage attempts to refine the initial results. The main difference in IRF is that it uses different modalities for the initial and final retrieval stages (e.g., images and text). Commonly, a pseudo-relevance feedback formulation is adopted (Chang et al. 2005 ; Ah-Pine et al. 2009b ), where instead of requiring user interaction, the top k 0 documents are considered relevant to the query. Accordingly, in this work we consider the pseudo-relevance feedback version of IRF, which will be referred to as IRF in the rest of the paper.

The very first step in this formulation is to define the initial and final modalities, each of which can be either labels or text. Then, using the documents and the query under the initial modality, documents are ranked according to the unimodal VSM; where the top k 0 documents are kept (usually k 0 B 20). Next, we extract all of the terms from the final modality that occur in the k 0 documents and create a query using such information; we denote such query with q C ; next, the just created query is combined with the query in the final modality (as provided by the user), we denote the query in the final modality with q F . Then we create an extended query by combining the queries as follows: where a C and a F are scalars weighting the contribution of queries q C and q F , respectively. Finally, we use the unimodal VSM, using q E as query and documents represented under the final modality, to rank the documents in the collection; see Chang et al. ( 2005 ), Ah-Pine et al. ( 2009b ) for further details on the IRF approach. One should note that under the IRF formulation the same modality can be used for both retrieval stages (e.g., text-text or labels-labels), in which case the IRF is just a straight pseudo-relevance feedback technique. In Sect. 6 we report experimental results with this unimodal formulation as well. We used k = 5 in our experiments based on preliminary experimentation with several values for k 0 in Smeulders et al. ( 2000 ), Snoek et al. ( 2006 ).

We have just described standard information-fusion techniques for combining labels and text. It is clear that although those methods take into account information from both modalities, they do not explicitly take advantage of the association among terms from the different modalities, which we believe can be helpful for better modeling the content of images. The next section describes two new ways of representing multimodal images that indeed exploit such multimodal term association. 4 Distributional term representations Distributional term representations (DTRs) are tools for term representation that rely on term occurrence and co-occurrence statistics (Lavelli et al. 2005 ). The intuition behind DTRs is that the meaning of a term can be deduced by its context; where the context for a term is determined by the other terms it co-occurs with frequently or by the documents in which the term occurs more frequently.
DTRs have been mostly used in computational linguistics for tasks that include term processing; for example, for term clustering (Lewis and Croft 1990 ), automatic thesaurus construction (Chen et al. 1995 ) and word-sense disambiguation (Gale et al. 1993 ). Little work has been reported on DTRs for (unimodal) information retrieval (Carrillo et al. 2009 ; Lavelli et al. 2005 ). In the latter field, DTRs have been only used for processing unimodal information (e.g., text) where the representation of a term is determined by its context in unimodal information. The novelty of our approach is that we study the use of DTRs for representing terms that belong to different modalities. Under our formulation the meaning of a term depends on statistics derived from both unimodal and multimodal information, which result in richer term representations and, in consequence, in better document representations.
We explore two different DTRs for term representation that are subsequently used for representing multimodal images. The rest of this section presents the specific DTRs we consider and the next section describes how multimodal terms can be represented under these DTRs. For our description, we consider documents that are composed by terms from a particular vocabulary M with | M | terms, for now we will not assume that M is associated to any specific modality. 4.1 Document occurrence representation (DOR) The document occurrence representation (DOR) is considered the dual of the tf-idf rep-resentation, see Eq. ( 1 ), that is used for representing documents: since documents can be represented by a distribution over the terms, terms can be represented by a distribution over documents. More formally, each term t j 2 M is represented by a vector 5 of weights w 0 B w j , k dor B 1 represents the contribution of document d k to the representation of t j . Specifically, we consider the following weighting scheme (Lavelli et al. 2005 ): where N k is the number of different terms that appear in document d k and df ( t j , d k ) is given by: where #( t j , d k ) denotes the number of times term t j occurs in document d k . The weights are normalized using cosine normalization. Intuitively, the more frequent the term t j occurs in document d k , the more important d k is to characterize the semantics of t j ; on the other hand, the more different terms occur in d k , the less it contributes to characterize the semantics of t j . 4.2 Term co-occurrence representation (TCOR) The term co-occurrence representation (TCOR) is similar to DOR, although it is based on the idea of representing a term t j according to a distribution over the terms it co-occurs with. Under TCOR each term t j 2 M is represented by a vector of weights w tcor j  X  TCOR representation of t j . Specifically, we consider the following weighting scheme (Lavelli et al. 2005 ): where N k is the number of terms in M that co-occur with t j in at least one document and ttf ( t j , t k ) is given by: where #( t j , t k ) indicates the number of documents in which t k and t j co-occur. The intuition of TCOR is that the more t k and t j co-occur, the more important t k is for describing term t j ; contribute to characterize the semantics of t j . 5 Semantic cohesion modeling This section introduces two strategies for representing multimodal documents that attempt to capture the semantic cohesion between terms from different modalities. For both strategies we first represent multimodal terms according to DOR or TCOR. Next, for representing a document we combine the representations of the terms that occur in the document. Accordingly, we first describe how to represent multimodal terms with the DTRs and then we introduce the strategies for representing documents. For all of the illustrations and descriptions of this section we consider the multimodal documents (i.e., annotated images) from the SAIAPR TC12 collection that we used for the evaluation of our methods; see Sect. 6 for details. 5.1 Multimodal distributional term representations Building DTRs for multimodal terms is rather simple because in the above description of DTRs we have made no assumption on the modality of the vocabulary M by which documents are composed. Hence, if we consider multimodal documents that contain terms from k different modalities with vocabularies X 1 ; ... ; X k , it is enough to define the vocabulary M as the union of the available vocabularies, that is M  X f X 1 ; ... ; X k g ; next, we just apply the corresponding weighting schemes described in Eqs. ( 6 ) and ( 8 ) by equally accounting for both unimodal and multimodal statistics. In this way the representation for a term will be determined by its semantic cohesion with other terms, which can belong to the same modality or not. In the rest of this section we describe the benefits of representing labels and textual terms according to DTRs and show how multimodal images can be represented by combining DTRs. Despite we have considered images, all of the methods we propose are applicable to other types of multimodal documents. 5.1.1 Multimodal DOR Recall that in the multimedia image retrieval scenario we consider the multimodal terms are words (text) and concepts (labels). Hence, the multimodal DOR representations (MDOR) for labels and words are distributions of occurrences over the documents in the collection in which such terms occur. Since multimodal images are composed of very few words and labels (Goodrum 2000 ; Grubinger 2007 ; Escalante et al. 2010 ), the MDOR representations for multimodal terms can be sparse distributions. For example, Fig. 2 shows (part of) the MDOR representations for the labels church-interior, church , and statue , and the words cathedral, church, saint , and statue , seven multimodal terms that are semantically related. The MDOR representation for those terms are based on 2,586 doc-uments out of the 20,000 that compose the SAIAPR TC12 collection; that is, 12.93% of the documents contribute to the MDOR representation for the seven terms.

From Fig. 2 we can see that MDOR provides reliable information for characterizing the semantics of a term: as the considered terms are semantically related they co-occur in similar documents and hence they have similar MDOR representations. One should note that the words cathedral and church do not co-occur in similar documents, despite they hold synonymy and hypernym relations (Miller et al. 1990 ). This lack of co-occurrence can be due to the short length of the annotations, which is a rather common issue in image retrieval. Hence a user searching for a religious building that uses as query the word church would not retrieve images that are associated with the word cathedral . However, when representing documents with MDOR (e.g., by adding the MDOR representations of terms that occur in the document), documents containing either word church or cathedral will have similar representations because of the fact that both words co-occur with the label church ; hence the label church acts as a link between two words that never occur in common documents.

The latter expansion cannot be exploited in unimodal DOR, because usually terms that are semantically related (e.g., synonyms and terms under an is-a relationship) are not used together in a document; that is why church and cathedral do not co-occur in common images. Nevertheless, related words may co-occur with common terms from other modalities, thus the incorporation of more than one modality is indeed providing additional useful information that is effectively exploited by MDOR. 5.1.2 Multimodal TCOR The multimodal TCOR (MTCOR) representations of words and labels are distributions of co-occurrences over the terms in the multimodal vocabulary; hence a term is represented through its multimodal context. For example, Fig. 3 shows the MTCOR representation for the label crocodile , whereas Fig. 4 shows the MTCOR representation for the word igloo ; we have added the postfix  X  X  X ia X  X  to labels to differentiate them from words in the textual vocabulary. 6
From Figs. 3 and 4 we can see that the MTCOR distributions of crocodile and igloo are determined by those terms that are more semantically related to them (i.e., their context). For example, for igloo the more associated labels are ice, sky, snow, trees and wall , whereas the most related words are angara, frozen, igloo, irkutsk, river and Russia . On the other hand, for the label crocodile , the most associated labels are crocodile, water, ground, vegetation , and plant , and the most related words are alligator, crocodile, pantanal , and Brazil . Therefore, MTCOR can be considered a multimodal expansion of the original term and, of course, a multimodal expansion is more informative than a unimodal one (as straight TCOR).

When representing multimodal images with MTCOR, documents are represented by the multimodal expansion of the terms in the document and not by the terms themselves. Thus, second order (multimodal) relationships are implicitly taken into account for document representation, which result in richer document representations. Also, as queries are rep-resented similarly, a multimodal query expansion is performed implicitly under MTCOR. 5.2 Representing images through MDOR and MTCOR In this work we attempt to exploit both MDOR and MTCOR to represent documents for multimedia image retrieval. A way of representing documents using MDOR and MTCOR is by adding the representations of the terms that occur in the document; we denote this strategy MTCOR-B and MDOR-B, for MTCOR and MDOR, respectively, where the  X  X  X  X  X  is with representations MTCOR and MDOR: f w tcor i ; ... ; w tcor N corresponding MTCOR-B and MDOR-B representations for d i are given by: where the dimensionality of d i mtcor -b is | M |, the number of terms in the vocabulary and that are normalized using cosine normalization.

Despite the fact that MDOR-B and MTCOR-B can reflect the content of documents they present some limitations. For example, they equally account for the occurrence of both common and uncommon terms (e.g., see the influence of the article the in Figs. 3 and 4 ), which is related to the importance of terms across the collection; also MDOR-B and MTCOR-B do not account for multiple occurrences of particular terms in documents, which reflects the importance of a term in a particular document. For alleviating the latter issues, we consider an alternative representation that is equivalent to the tf-idf represen-tation used in information retrieval (Salton et al. 1975 ). The corresponding representations are as follows: where tf m ( i , t i k ) is the number of times that term t i k appears in document i and N k m is the number of documents in the collection in which term t i k appears. Thus, the representations MDOR-TF-IDF (Eq. ( 12 )) and MTCOR-TF-IDF (Eq. ( 13 )) take into account the frequency of occurrence of terms and their usage across the collection.

For retrieving documents under the above representations we represent multimodal queries in a similar way. Then we compute the cosine similarity between query and documents and sort documents according to their similarity to the query.
 Besides providing richer representations, an advantage of representations based on MDOR and MTCOR is that queries can be formulated by using terms from either single modality; that is, a query can be a set of words (i.e., textual-only query), a set of labels (i.e., labels-only query) or a combination of words and labels (multimodal query). This is in contrast to common image retrieval techniques (e.g., LF, EF and IRF) where no multi-modal information is considered for image retrieval when using unimodal queries.

Under MDOR and MTCOR the representation of a unimodal query is a multimodal expansion of the unimodal terms; therefore, independently of whether queries are multi-modal or not, the representation will always be based on multimodal information. For example, consider the query shown in Fig. 5 , taken from the ImageCLEF 7 forum, which is composed of the textual terms:  X  X  X eligious statue in the foreground X  X  and of the label terms  X  X  X hurch-interior, statue, sky, vegetation X  X  .

Figures 6 and 7 show the MTCOR-TF-IDF representations for such query; Fig. 6 shows the MTCOR-TF-IDF representation for the textual part of the query, whereas Fig. 7 shows the labels part of the query. From these figures we can see that, even though the queries are unimodal, the corresponding MTCOR-TF-IDF representations capture important multi-modal terms that can be useful for retrieving documents.

One should note that documents that have information in only one modality can still be represented with MDOR and MTCOR based representations. This is advantageous on realistic settings because it allows us to index multimodal documents with mixed sources of information. 6 Experimental results In this section we evaluate the multimodal document representations described in Sect. 5 . The goal is to show the benefits offered by multimodal distribution term representations (DTRs) over standard methods. For all of our experiments we used the SAIAPR TC12 benchmark (Escalante et al. 2010 ). Sample images are shown in Fig. 1 . This collection is composed of 20,000 images that have been manually annotated at image level with free text descriptions (Grubinger 2007 ); additionally, images have been segmented and man-ually annotated with a predefined vocabulary of 255 labels (Escalante et al. 2010 ). Thus, multimodal documents in the SAIAPR TC12 collection are composed of (1) text accom-panying images, and (2) labels assigned to regions in the corresponding images.

Since we are interested in evaluating the benefits of using labels into multimedia image retrieval, we considered manually assigned labels for most of our experiments. In this way, our results represent an upper bound in the performance that can be obtained with auto-matic image annotation (AIA) labels. However, we also performed experiments with labels generated with a state-of-the art technique for AIA. The latter is a more realistic setting as most image collections lack labels. There our goal is to show that automatic labels can be helpful for image retrieval despite the limited performance of current AIA methods.
For evaluating the retrieval effectiveness of our methods we considered two sets of topics as used in the photographic retrieval task at the ImageCLEF2007 (60 topics) and ImageCLEF2008 (39 topics) forums (Grubinger et al. 2008 ; Arni et al. 2009 ). Each topic is composed of a fragment of text and three query images. Figure 5 shows a sample topic. For all of our experiments we manually assigned labels to query images, which were considered as query terms for the labels modality. The labels that we used for each topic are available from the website of our research group. 8 The acronyms for considered techniques are summarized in Table 1 .
 The considered scenario is as follows. For each retrieval technique (i.e., LF, EF, IRF, MDOR-B, MDOR-TF-IDF, MTCOR-B, MTCOR-TF-IDF) and for each set of topics (i.e., ImageCLEF2007 or ImageCLEF2008) we retrieve relevant documents to each topic. Next, using the corresponding relevance judgements, we evaluate the retrieval effectiveness for the considered methods for each topic. We report average results over the topics for each of the following evaluation measures: mean-average precision ( MAP , our leading evaluation measure), precision at 20 documents ( P20 ), recall at 20 documents ( R20 ) and the number of relevant retrieved documents ( RR ). In the following we will refer to the paired t-student test with a confidence level of 95% percent when mentioning statistical significance between retrieval results. We consider this test due to its widely adopted use in the evaluation of information retrieval methods (Smucker et al. 2009 ).

We have divided the experimental results into four sections that aim to evaluate dif-ferent aspects of our methods: (1) first we evaluate the performance of baseline methods; (2) next we assess the effectiveness of representations based on multimodal DTRs; (3) then we show how such representations can give support to unimodal queries; (4) finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the developed techniques when using automatically generated labels. 6.1 Results with baseline methods Table 2 shows the retrieval results obtained with the baseline techniques (LF, EF and IRF), we also show the performance obtained by unimodal retrieval models (VSM with tf-idf weighting). For LF and EF we report the performance obtained when a similar weight is used for both modalities (U) and when such weights are optimized (W, we performed several trial and error evaluations under a bijective search approach, at most 10 parameter settings were tried); for IRF we only show results obtained with the best configuration ( a f = 5 and a c = 1) as results with equal weights were very poor.
 The best individual results in all measures were obtained when only text was used (see Text in Table 2 ), which is not surprising as the considered topics include many queries with high semantic level. Nevertheless, the combination of labels and text outperformed the textual techniques under all of the considered baseline methods; the differences in MAP between the best result of each baseline technique and the textual method were statistically significant for both sets of topics.

The best results overall the evaluation measures was obtained with EF-W/ This method obtained a relative improvement of 53.59% in MAP over the textual method on average over both sets of topics, although it uses a weight for the textual modality that is 8-times superior than that assigned to the labels modality. LF-W obtained a relative gain of 10.02%; thus, labels were not very helpful for this strategy.

For LF-W, a weighting ratio of 1:2 yielded an improvement of 7.69% over the equal-weighting scheme (LF-U), in terms of MAP over the two sets of topics; while for EF-W the ratio 1:8 resulted in a corresponding improvement of 41.10%. The ratios are not comparable because weights a T and a L have different meanings for LF-W and EF-W: in LF-W, a T and a L weight the scores of individual VSMs based on a single modality, while in EF-W the weights have an impact in the features (terms) from the different modalities when esti-mating the similarity among documents. The difference in improvement can be explained by the fact that the VSM based on labels obtained low retrieval performance. Hence, combining its outputs with those of the textual VSM resulted in a limited improvement for LF-W. On the other hand, information from label occurrence resulted very helpful for EF-W: by adjusting the weights for the different features we can obtain significant improvements. Thus evidencing the fact that labels can be very helpful for image retrieval, although it is not clear what is the best way of incorporating them.

The IRF-2 setting improved by 32.51% the MAP obtained by the best unimodal technique. It is interesting that the best result was obtained when the initial modality was individual results of the unimodal technique based on labels are rather poor. This can be due to the fact that despite such individual method obtained low performance in MAP, R20 and RR , the precision ( P20 ) obtained by such technique was much more competitive. Thus, the first documents retrieved by using only labels can be relevant with high prob-ability. The latter fact combined with a high weighting to the final query ( a f = 5) make that this configuration obtained the best results for IRF. Results obtained with IRF when using the same modality as initial and final modalities (IRF-1 and IRF3 in Table 2 ) improve the corresponding unimodal techniques, confirming the effectiveness of the straight pseudo-relevance feedback formulation.

Summarizing, the results in Table 2 show that the use of labels can be very helpful for improvement offered by the multimodal baselines was statistically significant and the corresponding results are very competitive. 6.2 Results with multimodal distributional representations In this section we report the performance obtained with representations based on MDOR and MTCOR as described in Sect. 5 ; we compare those representations with the best result obtained with baseline techniques (see Table 2 ). Results obtained with multimodal dis-tributional representations on both versions (i.e., B and TF-IDF) are shown in Table 3 . This table shows interesting results. First, both types of representations, MDOR and MTCOR, in both versions, B and TF-IDF, obtain highly competitive results; even tough we have not applied any strategy for optimizing the retrieval process just as we did with the baseline techniques. On both representations the best results were obtained with the TF-IDF version, which is not surprising as this version takes into account the frequency of appearance of terms as well as their usage.
 MTCOR-TF-IDF obtained better results than EF-W (the best baseline method) on ImageCLEF2008 topics, the relative improvement in MAP is of 5.24%; although it obtained slightly lower results on ImageCLEF2007 topics. The decreasing in perfor-mance is by 2.43%. On the other hand, MDOR-TF-IDF outperforms significantly (in all measures but P20 in ImageCLEF2007 topics) the results obtained with any other technique on both sets of topics. The relative improvement of MDOR-TF-IDF over EF-Win MAP is of 18.01% (averaged over the two sets of topics), while the corresponding improvement over the textual method (Text) is of 81.15%. The latter results show the benefits of using the proposed representations over the baseline methods (which require a parameter optimization stage for obtaining satisfactory results) and over unimodal retrieval methods.

In Sect. 6.1 we showed that varying the weights associated to each modality (i.e., a T and a ) for the baseline methods increases their retrieval effectiveness. Therefore, we per-formed an experiment in which we tried to control the contribution of each modality into the representations MDOR-TF-IDF and MTCOR-TF-IDF. It should be noted that under the proposed representations we cannot assign weights to the involved modalities in a natural way. Nevertheless, we decided to weight the representations of the terms that belong to different modalities with a different weight; for example, the weighted version of MTCOR-TF-IDF is given by: with: where a T and a L are scalars weighting the contribution of the textual and labels modalities, ment d i using only terms from the labels and textual modalities, respectively. N i l is the number of terms from the labels vocabulary that appear in the document i and N i t is the number of terms from the vocabulary of text that occur in document i . The weighted MDOR-TF-IDF representation can obtained similarly. Intuitively, the weights a L and a T weight the importance of the labels ( a L ) and words ( a T ) that occur in document d i . We call the weighted versions of the representations MDOR-TF-IDF-W and MTCOR-TF-IDF-W.
 We performed experiments with different values for a T and a L with both MDOR-TF-IDF-W and MTCOR-TF-IDF-W, the best results are shown in Table 4 . The improvement in MAP obtained with the weighted version of MDOR-TF-IDF over the un-weighted one is of only 1.03%. On the other hand, the weighted version of MTCOR-TF-IDF improved by 5.98% to the un-weighted version. Note that while MTCOR-TF-IDF-W improved the performance of MTCOR-TF-IDF in all measures, MDOR-TF-IDF-W did not improve the performance of MDOR-TF-IDF in P20 and RR . The latter result indicates that MDOR-TF-IDF-W modified negatively the order of documents in the first positions and that less relevant documents were retrieved with MDOR-TF-IDF-W.

The results from Table 4 show that the way we have weighted the contribution of each modality may not be the best, as when we modified the weights for the standard techniques we obtained improvements of over 40% in terms of MAP (see for example the results obtained with EF-W in Table 2 ). However, those results give evidence that the proposed representations are more robust to the optimization of weights than standard techniques. Thus, even without optimizing the weights we can obtain highly competitive performance.
It is interesting that the best configurations were obtained by assigning similar weights to both modalities (i.e., the weight assigned to the textual modality is at most the double of that assigned to the labels modality). The latter suggest that both modalities contribute similarly to obtain an effective representation for documents. This is opposed to what happened with EF-W where the best configuration was obtained by assigning a weight 8 times larger to the textual modality.

If we compare the results obtained by MDOR-TF-IDF-W (row 4 in Table 4 ) with the results reported in the ImageCLEF2007 (Grubinger et al. 2008 ) and ImageCLEF2008 (Arni et al. 2009 ) forums, we could see that our method would be ranked in positions 36 and 143 of a total of 474 and 1,047 entries submitted to ImageCLEF2007 and ImageC-LEF2008, respectively; that is, within the 7.6 and 13.7% of the total of submitted runs, respectively. This is a very positive result, since we should note that the retrieval systems that were evaluated in those forums were composed of a considerable number of com-ponents besides the retrieval model. For example, some researchers analyzed syntactically et al. 2006 ; Maillot et al. 2006 ), performed query expansion with external resources (Chang and Chen 2006 ), included processes that required user interaction (Clinchant et al. 2007 ) or even combined multiple retrieval models (Grubinger et al. 2008 ; Arni et al. 2009 ). In this paper, however, we have obtained satisfactory results by using a simple VSM based on the representations we proposed. In consequence, we expect to obtain better results when other components will be combined with our methods.

Table 5 shows results of statistical significance tests among the different results in terms of MAP . From this table we can verify that the configuration MDOR-TF-IDF-W out-performs any other method and that these differences are statistically significant; MDOR-TF-IDF outperforms to all but the EF-W method, which proved to be very effective. On the other hand, results obtained with MTCOR representations are not statistically better than the methods EF-W and LF-W. Thus, the best option for representing documents is MDOR-TF-IDF-W or even MDOR-TF-IDF. Representations based on MTCOR are less effective, although, in average, better performance than LF, EF and IRF can be obtained with such techniques.

We have seen that MDOR-based representations outperformed consistently those based on MTCOR. This can be due to the size of the collection and the number of terms per document. Since documents are composed of 11.43 terms in average, the co-occurrence statistics used by MTCOR are not enough for effectively capturing the context of terms; which directly affects the corresponding document representations. On the other hand, each term from the multimodal vocabulary occurs (in average) in 33.13 documents of the collection; therefore, the document occurrence information is less sparse and hence MDOR based representations are richer than MTCOR ones.

Besides retrieval performance, document representations based on MDOR and MTCOR offer an additional advantage, namely: they can capture better the content of documents and queries; for illustrating the latter aspect, in Fig. 8 we show the top 5 non-relevant documents retrieved with the proposed representations and with baseline methods for the topic shown in Fig. 5 .

We can see that even non-relevant documents that were retrieved with MDOR-TF-IDF and MTCOR-TF-IDF (rows 1 and 2) are semantically related to the topic (i.e., religious statues), giving evidence that the multimodal DTRs effectively capture the semantic content of the queries. On the other hand, the non-relevant documents as retrieved with EF-W, LF-W and IRF-2 (rows 3-6) are not related at all to the topic of interest. Thus, besides that multimodal DTRs are helpful for improving the multimedia image retrieval perfor-mance of the VSM, they are able to capture effectively the content of queries and documents.
 6.3 Unimodal queries with multimodal representations Although the proposed representations are based on information resulting from the inter-action between multimodal terms, it may be possible that users of image collections are not willing to formulate queries in both modalities. That is, for some users it may be more comfortable to specify queries by means of images, or through the labels associated to the images; while for other users it may be more easy to provide textual queries. With the goal of evaluating the usefulness of the proposed representations under the latter retrieval scenarios we performed the following experiment.

For each topic we considered separately the modalities that compose the query. That is, we search for images by using as query either labels or words, but using the multimodal representations for documents/queries as described in Sect. 5 . Results of this experiment are shown in Table 6 , for comparison we also show the results obtained with LF, EF and IRF. 9
It is clear that while the effectiveness of all methods decreased considerably, the rep-resentations MDOR-TF-IDF and MTCOR-TF-IDF were still able to obtain acceptable performance. The baseline methods obtained satisfactory results when the query was formulated in text, however, when the query was formulated by means of labels, the standard techniques obtained very poor results. On the other hand, the methods MDOR-TF-IDF and MTCOR-TF-IDF obtained acceptable results for queries in both modalities, giving evidence that documents are effectively represented with the proposed represen-tations and illustrating another benefit of using multimodal DTRs for representing documents. 6.4 Results with automatically generated labels For all of the experiments described so far we have considered labels that were manually assigned to images. However, in many databases images have not associated any label, thus the use of automatic image annotation (AIA) methods is imperative in such collec-tions. In this section we report experimental results obtained with the proposed repre-sentations when using the AIA technique introduced in Escalante et al. ( 2011 ). Such method uses multiclass classifiers and a labeling refinement method that attempts to maximize the cohesion of labels through the minimization of an energy function. For our experiments we performed 10-fold cross-validation for automatically assigning labels to each region in the SAIAPR TC12 collection.

In Table 7 we show the retrieval results when using labels automatically generated. As expected, the retrieval effectiveness of all of the methods decreased significantly. Nev-ertheless, MDOR-TF-IDF-W still outperforms the results obtained with unimodal tech-niques. The best performance in MAP was obtained with MDOR-TF-IDF-W, with a weight 10 times higher for text than for labels. While the best result of baseline methods was obtained by EF with a weight 8 times higher for the textual modality. In this scenario a high weight to the textual part compensates the uncertainty inherent in assigning labels automatically.
 One should note that the use of automatic labels affected significantly the representation MTCOR-TF-IDF-W. This can be due to the fact that co-occurrence statistics among labels and text are not reliable any more (i.e., if many images in the collection are incorrectly labeled, the co-occurrence statistics among labels and words will be erroneous) and hence the MTCOR representations of terms do not reflect the semantics of terms.

MDOR-TF-IDF-W is more robust than MTCOR-TF-IDF-W because this representation is based on term occurrence in documents, thus even when labels assigned to documents are incorrect, the mistakes made by the AIA method will be (more or less) consistent across most documents in the collection (e.g., if the AIA method confuses the label  X  X  X ky X  X  with the label  X  X  X loud X  X  , this confusion will prevail in most documents of the collection) and therefore the automatic labels still will be helpful to represent terms and hence documents as well.

An additional issue that affected the performance of the evaluated techniques is that for assigning automatic labels we only considered 90 concepts (those for which there exist at least 200 regions across the collection) out of the 255 used for the other experiments. Hence, it is very likely that the considered labels did not include labels that were used for building queries (e.g the label  X  X  X tatue X  X  was not considered, hence, labels cannot improve the retrieval performance for the topic shown in Fig. 5 ). Also, the accuracy of the AIA method that we used is below 40%. Nevertheless, we expect that the retrieval performance of the proposed techniques will improve when better AIA methods are used. 7 Conclusions We have introduced two novel representations for multimodal documents that are based on the idea of modeling the semantic cohesion among multimodal terms. The proposed representations were successfully applied to the multimedia image retrieval task. On the one hand, under the MDOR representation (for multimodal document occurrence rep-resentation ) each term of the vocabulary is represented by a distribution of occurrences over the documents in the collection. This way, the documents where mostly occur a term determine its representation; terms that occur in similar documents will have similar representations. On the other hand, under the MTCOR representation (for multimodal term co-ocurrence representation ), the terms are represented by a distri-bution of co-occurrences over the terms in the vocabulary. Terms that frequently co-occur with related terms will have similar representations. We represent multimodal documents by combining the representations of the terms that occur in the document. Thus, documents are represented by distributions over either documents or terms. Both forms of document representation can be considered an expansion of the terms that occur in the document, such expansion will be determined by the context in which terms occur.

We compare the proposed representations with highly effective baseline methods that combine text and labels. Our results show that the proposed representations outperform the baseline techniques significantly. Furthermore, the proposed representations offer addi-tional benefits. Specifically, they are able to capture the semantics of documents better and allow us to search for images by using unimodal queries. The results reported in this paper give evidence of the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed representations.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:  X  We introduced two novel ways of representing multimodal documents that are based on  X  We reported experimental evidence that shows how the proposed representations can  X  We presented retrieval results with the proposed methods using labels generated
Future work directions include using the MDOR and MTCOR based representations for modeling other multimodal documents and with other retrieval models; using the MDOR and MTCOR representations to obtain richer visual vocabularies for the tasks of object recognition and image categorization; taking advantage of MDOR and MTCOR for the development of methods for query expansion and relevance feedback; extending the MDOR and MTCOR document representations; studying the complementariness and redundancy of MDOR and MTCOR representations; and developing an effective way to weight the contribution of both modalities (text and labels) under the MDOR and MTCOR representations.
