 In this paper, we propose a new method to measure the visu-alness of a concept. The visualness of a concept is generally defined as what extent a concept has visual characteristics. Even though the visualness of a concept is important and useful for various image search tasks, it has not received much spotlight yet. In this work, we especially focus on how to measure the visualness of a complex concept such as  X  X ound table X ,  X  X ry bed X  rather than a simple concept like  X  X all X ,  X  X pple X . To measure the visualness, we first collect sample images of a complex concept using web image search engines, and then group the images based on the visual fea-tures. Finally, we compute visual purity and weighted en-tropy of the clusters, which will act as a visualness score for the concept. Through various experiments, we show and discuss interesting results about the visualness of a concept.

How to effectively annotate images and how to efficiently search images are important, yet still difficult and challeng-ing problems. Traditional computer vision techniques have supported these tasks by studying object-level solutions such as object recognition, object classification, and so on [14,  X  This work was done during the first author X  X  internship at Microsoft Research Asia (a) V s ( X  X ed tomato X )=0.71 (b) V s ( X  X ise fish X )=0.97 Figure 1: The visualness of concept X  red tomato  X  X nd  X  wise fish  X . The red tomato looks more visualizble. 10, 2]. Beyond object-level solutions, techniques for learn-ing visual attributes are recently spotlighted due to their advantages in various applications [7, 11, 1, 5]. The goal of these approaches is to learn visual attributes of an ob-ject such as  X  X triped X ,  X  X ound X ,  X  X asPaw X , and to use the visual attributes to predict a concept of an object. These approaches have been proven to be especially useful for face verification and search, zero-shot object classification, and building a large-scale image search system [7, 11, 1].
The above approaches, however, mainly focus on a sim-ple concept . That is, the goal of the previous approaches is to improve the quality of the image search (or classifi-cation) based on the simple concept like  X  X pple X  or  X  X iger X . There still remains a lot of challenges for complex concepts . In this paper,  X  X omplex concept X  indicates a concept whose text representation takes the form of Adjective (attribute) + Noun (concept). For example,  X  X ld tiger X  or  X  X eautiful gar-den X  is a kind of complex concept . Compared to the previous approaches, we focus on how to support image classification and search tasks based on the general complex concept .
As the first step on this direction, we aim to answer the fundamental question:  X  X ow an attribute and a concept as-sociate with each other? X  For this, we learn a correlation between a particular attribute A and a certain concept C by measuring the visualness of a complex concept AC in the Web image domain. Finally, we provide this information as a fundamental knowledge-base for image classification and search tasks.

In this work, we re-define the visualness of a concept as how consistent the visual appearance of image search results for the concept is. If the visualness of complex concept AC is high, this means that the possibility of the association between attribute A and concept C is also high. Fig. 1 shows an example of the measured visualness for different two concepts. From Fig. 1, we can see that the visualness of red tomato is higher than that of wise fish . Therefore, we can say the possibility of the association between  X  X ed X  and  X  X omato X  is higher than that of  X  X ise X  and  X  X ish X . The potentials of using our knowledge-base include: Improving image annotation : our knowledge-base of the visualness can act as a reference model when annotating images with complex concepts. The proposed method can provide useful information such as a visual exemplar model for a particular complex concept, the relatedness of the an-notation text to the image contents, and so on.
 Improving query suggestion : using the visualness infor-mation of a concept, query suggestion systems may consider which attribute (or simple concept) is more appropriate for a certain simple concept (or attribute) to present more rel-evant results, so that can provide users with more useful query terms.
 Improving user X  X  satisfaction on image search : var-ious interesting image search results can be given to users based on the visualness of concepts. For example, users can be given the highly visualizable images sharing similar at-tributes. Also, attribute-based navigation of image search results will be possible with our knowledge-base.
There have been various studies to measure the visualness of a concept using a text-based approach [4, 8, 9]. They ex-ploited WordNet or term-frequency information to predict the visualness of a concept. However, these works only fo-cused on the simple concept, also did not consider the visual features of a concept while computing the visualness.
Olga Russakovsky and Li Fei-Fei [11] exploited ImageNet [3], a large-scale image ontology based on WordNet, to dis-cover a visual connection between concepts by using crowd-source like workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). This is one of possible achievements from our work. From the experimental results, they showed visual relationships between the concepts in ImageNet. However, the size of learned visual attributes is very small (i.e., 20). [13] is the closest work to ours. They tried to measure the visualness of a concept, specifically, adjective terms such as  X  X ellow X ,  X  X eligious X  and so on. They computed the vi-sualness of 150 adjective terms by performing probabilistic region selection for images labelled as positive and negative examples of the term, and then computing the entropy mea-sure. However, they only focused on adjective terms and the size of concepts used in the experiment is also too small.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to measure the visualness of a large set of complex concepts.
Our approach starts with collecting the images associated with a complex concept from the Web. A set of image search results are then grouped into k clusters according to their visual features. After clustering, we only pick the clusters whose size is larger than  X  t as major clusters for the com-plex concept. Finally, purity and entropy among the major clusters are calculated to compute the final visualness score.
In order to build a vocabulary of complex concepts, we collected 100 noun terms and 120 adjective terms. Our noun terms (simple concepts) are derived from the list of all time most popular tags in Flickr and additional noun terms. The list of the concepts used in our work is popular enough and not domain specific. For attributes, we adopt a classification scheme for adjectives designed by [12]. We also classified our concepts and attributes into various categories according to the nature of each concept or attribute.

A full list of complex conceptsis derived from the full com-bination of attributes and noun terms. In total, a full com-bination of 120 attributes  X  100 noun concepts = 12,000 complex concepts are used to measure the visualness. We collected the images for each complex concept by querying each term to Bing image search engine (all images are col-lected from 15/Feb/2012 to 20/Feb/2012). The top k image results for each concept are crawled to measure the visual-ness of the concept. In our experiment, we set k as 100, therefore, totally 1,200,000 images are collected.
To measure the visualness of a certain concept, we first detect the representative images for the concept. This is done by 1) clustering the image search results, and then 2) only keeping the clusters whose size is larger than a thresh-old. The images in the survived clusters are considered as representative images for the concept. Compared to previ-ous work to measure the visualness, we exploit a clustering algorithm which automatically determines the appropriate number of clusters to be generated. The reason we do not use K-MEANS like clustering algorithm is that 1) it requires pre-defined parameter k to determine the number of clusters to be generated, 2) our goal in this phase is to detect the representative images (or image clusters) rather than just grouping the images for a concept.

From these reasons, we exploit a message passing mecha-nism based clustering algorithm called affinity propagation [6]. Affinity propagation is to find exemplars from a set of data based on the similarity among the data. After clus-tering using affinity propagation, we filter out the clusters whose size is smaller than  X  t to exploit only representative images for a concept. In our experiment, we set  X  t as 10.
We define the visualness of a concept as how consistent the visual appearance of image search results for the concept is. That is, the more visually consistent the image clusters of a concept are, the higher the visualness of the concept is. To measure the visual consistency of the image search results for a concept, we compute the purity and entropy of the representative clusters.
 Intra-Cluster Purity: The purity of an intra image cluster is defined by a dissimilarity between the cluster centroid and cluster members. Given a set of n images { x 0 ,x 1 ,...,x in k -th image cluster C k , the purity P of cluster C k ,P ( k ) , is calculated as: , where x k is a centroid image of cluster k , | C k | is the number of images in cluster k , and s ( i,j ) is a dissimilarity between image i and j . In this context, the lower the value of P ( k ) is, the more pure cluster K is. We use Euclidean distance measure as a dissimilarity function.
 Inter-Cluster Purity: The inter-image cluster purity is defined by a dissimilarity between the average feature of each clusters. The average feature vector of cluster k , is computed by obtaining a mean vector from the feature vectors of all images in cluster k . And then, inter-cluster purity IP for concept C , IP C , is calculated as ,where RC is a set of representative clusters, | RC | is the number of representative clusters, and s ( i,j ) is a dissimilar-ity between feature vector purity, the lower the value of IP C is, the more pure the clus-ters of concept C are.
 Entropy: We also calculate Shannon entropy among the clusters of a concept to figure out how coherent the rep-resentative image clusters are. Given k image clusters for concept C , the shannon entropy for concept C , H ( C ), is computed as The probability of each cluster p ( x i ) is computed as p ( x | x | / | C | , where | x i | is the number of images in cluster x and | C | is the number of images for concept C .
 Visualness Score: We intend to give a high visualness score to the concept who has coherent clusters, each of which has high purity. To reflect this, we exploit a purity of each image cluster as a weight for each cluster while computing the Shannon entropy for a concept. In addition, the final entropy value is amplified according to the inter-cluster pu-rity value for the concept. Therefore, the final equation for measuring the visualness score of concept C , V s ( C ) is Therefore, the lower the visualness score of concept c is, the more visualizable concept c is.
In our experiment, each image is represented as a vector of global features including 81-d grid color moment, a 37-d edge histrogram, and a 120-d Gabor wavelet texture feature.
First, we performed an experiment to figure out which concepts are more visualizable and what makes them visu-alizable. To this end, we compute visualness scores for all complex concepts through the proposed method described in Sec. 3. And then, all complex concepts are ranked ac-cording to their visualness score. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show the top 30 visualizable concepts and the bottom 30 visualiz-able concepts and their example images derived from their major clusters, respectively. From both experimental re-sults, we can see some interesting observations. First, as expected, a concept whose representative images have con-sistent visual appearance and strong coherence has a high visualness score. As shown in Fig. 2, the example images associated with high visualizable concepts (e.g., round an-niversary, beautiful garden) have a consistent visual appear-ance. On the other hand, as can be seen in Fig. 3, the rep-resentative images of less visualizable concepts do not have consistent visual appearance, so that we cannot easily imag-ine how such concepts would be visualized. Second, we can Figure 2: The top 30 visualizable complex concept and example images Figure 3: The bottom 30 visualizable complex con-cept and example images find that some concepts are considered highly visualizable in our system even though their visual appearance may be not easily captured by human with a common sense. For ex-ample,  X  X ead island X ,  X  X ise zoo X ,  X  X ry bed X  took high ranks in our experiment. This is a very interesting result. From our analysis, the reasons for this phenomenon are twofold: 1) Most of those concepts are kinds of named entities or product names. For example,  X  X ead island X  is one of the famous video games and  X  X ise zoo X  is also one of the pop-ular baby carriages. Therefore, these kinds of concepts are deemed highly visualizable in Web image domains. 2) Some of these concepts are polysemies. For example, we cannot easily imagine the visual appearance of  X  X ry bed X  if we recog-nize  X  X ed X  a  X  X  furniture used as a place to sleep X . However,  X  X ry bed X  is well visualized when a bed is considered  X  X n area of ground in a garden or river X . These interesting in-formation are important and useful for both annotating and searching images. Also, the representative images for each complex concept in our knowledge-base can be useful visual reference models when annotating/searching images. Table 1: The top 5 visualizable simple concepts Table 2: The visualness score for each category of simple concepts In this Section, we show the visualness of simple concepts. For this, we grouped the complex concepts by their simple concept names. And then, we calculated the minimum, av-erage, and the maximum visualness score for each simple concept. All the simple concepts are then ranked according to the average visualness score.

Table 1 shows the top 5 visualizable simple concepts. From the experiment, we could find that some popular concepts in online photo communities (e.g., Flickr) are ranked at high positions. Table 2 is a summary of the visualness score for each category that a simple concept can belong to. Similar to the result of Table 1, the categories that are 1) not ab-stract and 2) popular in online photo communities take high ranks.
Now we show which attribute is more visualizable than others. Similarly to the method described in Section 4.2, we group all complex concepts by their attribute names and then rank them by the average visualness score. Table 3 shows the top 5 visualizable attributes. The experimental results also provide interesting observations. We can see that there are some interesting attributes that seem to be not eas-ily visualizable (i.e., north, dead). This result indicates that even though an attribute itself may be considered not visu-alizable, it can get a high visualness score if combined with a particular simple concept. Table 4 also provides a summary of the visualness score for each category that an attribute can belong to. The result of the summary for the visual-ness of attribute categories is a little bit different from the that of concept categories. Compared to the simple concept categories, the attributes categories that sound somewhat abstract (e.g., temporally-related:old) take the high ranks. These results show that the visualness of complex concepts are more affected by a kind of simple concept.
In this paper, we proposed a method to measure the vi-sualness of complex concepts such as  X  X eautiful garden X . Through various experimental results, we showed and dis-cussed interesting aspects about the visualness of concepts. Table 4: The visualness score for each category of attributes Our ultimate goal is to generate a large-scale matrix con-taining the relationships between concepts and attributes. For this, we are now extending the scale of our dataset to billions of images and concepts, also studying a more effi-cient method to measure the visualness from the large-scale dataset.
