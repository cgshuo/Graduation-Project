Once you are at that site, you can create an account and password with which you can enter the ACM Manu script Central manuscript review tracking system. From a drop-down list of journals, choose ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology and proceed to the Author Center to submit your man-uscript and your accompanying files.
 You will be asked to create an abstract that will be used throughout the system as a synopsis of your paper. You will also be asked to classify your submission using the ACM Computing Classification System through a link provided at the Author Center. For completeness, please select at least one primary-level classification followed by two secondary-level classifications. To make the process easier, you may cut and paste from the list. Remem-ber, you, the author, know best which area and sub-areas are covered by your paper; in addition to clarifying the area where your paper belongs, classification often helps in quickly identifying suitable reviewers for your paper. So it is important that you provide as thorough a classification of your paper as possible. The ACM Production Department prefers that your manuscript be prepared in either LaTeX or Ms Word format. Style files for manuscript preparation can be obtained at the following location: http:// www. acm. org/ pubs/ submissions/submission.htm . For editorial review, the manuscript should be submitted as a PDF or Post script file. Accompanying material can be in any number of text or image formats, as well as software/ documentation bundles in zip or tar-gzipped formats.
 Questions regarding editorial review process should be directed to the Editor-in-Chief. Questions regarding the post-acceptance production process should be addressed to the Publisher, Jono Hardjowirogo, at jono@ hq.acm.org .

Submission to the ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology is done electronically through http://acm. manuscriptcentral. com . Once you are at that site, you can create an account and password with which you can enter the ACM Manu script Central manuscript review tracking system. From a drop-down list of journals, choose
ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology and proceed to the Author Center to submit your man-uscript and your accompanying files.

You will be asked to create an abstract that will be used throughout the system as a synopsis of your paper. You will also be asked to classify your submission using the ACM Computing Classification System through a link provided at the Author Center. For completeness, please select at least one primary-level classification followed by two secondary-level classifications. To make the process easier, you may cut and paste from the list. Remem-ber, you, the author, know best which area and sub-areas are covered by your paper; in addition to clarifying the area where your paper belongs, classification often helps in quickly identifying suitable reviewers for your paper. So it is important that you provide as thorough a classification of your paper as possible. The ACM Production Department prefers that your manuscript be prepared in either LaTeX or Ms Word format.
Style files for manuscript preparation can be obtained at the following location: http:// www. acm. org/ pubs/ submissions/submission.htm . For editorial review, the manuscript should be submitted as a PDF or Post script file. Accompanying material can be in any number of text or image formats, as well as software/ documentation bundles in zip or tar-gzipped formats.

Questions regarding editorial review process should be directed to the Editor-in-Chief. Questions regarding the post-acceptance production process should be addressed to the Publisher, Jono Hardjowirogo, at jono@ hq.acm.org . Subscription, Single Copy, and Membership Information.

Submission to the ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology is done electronically through http://acm. manuscriptcentral. com . Once you are at that site, you can create an account and password with which you can enter the ACM Manu script Central manuscript review tracking system. From a drop-down list of journals, choose
ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology and proceed to the Author Center to submit your man-uscript and your accompanying files.

You will be asked to create an abstract that will be used throughout the system as a synopsis of your paper. You will also be asked to classify your submission using the ACM Computing Classification System through a link provided at the Author Center. For completeness, please select at least one primary-level classification followed by two secondary-level classifications. To make the process easier, you may cut and paste from the list. Remem-ber, you, the author, know best which area and sub-areas are covered by your paper; in addition to clarifying the area where your paper belongs, classification often helps in quickly identifying suitable reviewers for your paper. So it is important that you provide as thorough a classification of your paper as possible.
The ACM Production Department prefers that your manuscript be prepared in either LaTeX or Ms Word for-mat. Style files for manuscript preparation can be obtained at the following location: http://www.acm.org/ publications/submissions .
