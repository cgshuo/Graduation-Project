Macquarie University 1. INTRODUCTION
In October 2005, the Asian Federation for Natural Language Processing (AFNLP) held its second annual conference, the 2005 International Joint Con-ference on Natural Language Processing, on Jeju Island in Korea. The program committee received 289 submissions in total, with 90 being accepted for oral presentation. The range and quality of the submissions received indicated that this young conference series had already established itself on the international scene. We considered it appropriate to celebrate this fact by showcasing ex-tended and revised versions of some of the best papers from the conference in a journal publication.

With the help of the conference program committee, we identified a short list of candidate papers and invited their authors to provide much more extended versions of their reported work. With no guarantee that they would eventually be accepted, these submissions then underwent an additional round of review-ing with the degree of timely reflection that is possible in journal publication, where one is not quite so hurriedly fighting tight reviewing deadlines.
The result is the collection of three excellent papers that follow this introduc-tion; each takes as its starting point a paper widely agreed to be of the highest quality at the conference, but extends the material presented there, and takes on-board detailed comments from the subsequent round of reviewing. 2. THE PAPERS
Oh, Choi, and Isahara X  X  paper, A Machine Transliteration Model based on Corre-spondence between Graphemes and Phonemes , is concerned with the process of converting words in one language into phonetically equivalent words in another language, a common strategy used by translators when dealing with represent-ing proper names or technical terms in a language whose script differs from that of the source language. Machine transliteration is an important subproblem in machine translation and in information-retrieval tasks that transcend lan-guages; a variety of approaches have been proposed as solutions to this problem.
Oh et al. take the somewhat unexplored direction of using the correspondence between the source graphemes and the source phonemes and demonstrate that this can provide quite significant increases in performance.
 Gao, Suzuki, and Yuani X  X  paper, An Empirical Study on Language Model
Adaptation , looks at the problem of how to adjust the parameters of a language model so that it performs well on a particular domain. The utility of a language model always depends on the extent to which the training data used to build it is representative of the subsequent unseen data it will be applied to and so some means of automatically adapting an existing language model to new data is very desirable. Gao et al. perform a number of experiments to determine the performance of four different language model adaptation methods; among other results, they demonstrate that discriminative training models are superior to linear interpolation, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) method.

Ye and Baldwin X  X  paper, Semantic Role Labeling of Prepositional Phrases , ac-knowledges the variety of semantic relationships that can be expressed by any given preposition in English, and explore the idea of constructing a semantic tagger that is specifically targeted at prepositional phrases (PPs). The idea here is to use the context surrounding the PP to determine an appropriate semantic analysis; in the paper, they describe two systems they have constructed to ad-dress this task, one trained on the Penn Treebank, and the second on the data from the CoNLL 2004 Semantic Role Labeling shared task. In the first case, the results are very encouraging, but this is not so in the second case; the authors then analyze the negative results in the second experiment to identify key areas where progress needs to be made in appropriately labeling prepositions with their semantics.

I would like to thank the following individuals for their help in reviewing the submissions to this special section of the journal: Gosse Bouma, Berlin Chen, Kentaro Inui, Olivia Kwong, Gina Levow, Jimmy Lin, Helen Meng, Tokunaga
Takenobu, Hsin-min Wang, and Dell Zhang. Their courteous and timely reviews of the papers submitted to the special section resulted in a very smooth process.
I X  X  sure all the authors represented here would agree with me in complimenting the reviewers on the thoughtful and helpful nature of their reviews.
