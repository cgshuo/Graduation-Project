 beneficial to conduct sentiment analysis on the massive short texts on the Web so that people can know the public opinions on interested events or products. 
So far, most sentiment analysis works on short texts are based on sentiment dictiona-final sentiment polarity of a sentence by some scoring methods, which can be classified into two types. One is to count the opinion words of each polarity, respectively, and fur-ther determine the sentimental polarity of the sentence [1, 2]. The other type is based on classification task and considers opinion word s as features. However, there are two prob-lems existing in previous studies: Problem 1: It is not appropriate to simply count the number of opinion words to de-termine the polarity of a sentence, because an opinion word may not contain any kind words  X  well  X  and  X  bad  X  will be recognized as a positive opinion word and a negative word because they appear in the sentimen t dictionary. However, in this example,  X  well  X  is rather an auxiliary word and does not bear any sentiment because it does not modify any targets in the sentence. Thus, only opinion words modifying some targets in a sentence can make sense in sentiment analysis. words in the sentence. We have to consider the target modified by an opinion word, be-cause many opinion words have different polarities when modifying different targets. For opinion words and targets when detecting the sentiment polarity of a sentence. 
Therefore, in this paper we focus on  X  appraisal expressions  X  [5, 6], which are we can further construct target-sensitive sentiment dictionaries to solve the aforemen-Specially, we propose a filtering-refinement framework to extract appraisal expres-sions from short texts. The framework of our proposed approach to extracting appraisal expressions is shown in Fig. 1. 
Our proposed framework contains a filtering stage and a refinement stage. During the filtering procedure, we use named entity recognition tools to extract pairs of noun phrases and adjectives as appraisal expression candidates. This is to get all the possible appraisal expressions. Compared with existing rule-based approaches that will exclude many correct appraisal expressions, this filtering procedure is beneficial to keep a high recall for appraisal expression extraction. In order to improve precision, we design a refinement procedure that works on the appraisal expression candidates generated by the filtering step. This procedure is to remove wrong instances fr om the appraisal expression candidates. classifying appraisal expression candidates into two sets, namely a set of correct expressions and another set of wrong expressions. Unlike traditional classification methods that need manual labeling on training sets, we introduce dependency training sets. Thus, combined with existing classification models (we use SVM in this work), we can provide an adaptive solution for appraisal expression extractions. This is simple because our approach does not depend manual labeling on training sets and can suit for different styles of short texts. 
Dependency grammar is used to describe the dependency relationship between shape  X , the word  X  fantastic  X  has a dependency relationship with  X  shape  X . There have been many tools that can be used to extract dependency relations of a sentence, such as Stanford Parser. Thus, in our study, we simply use the Stanford Parser for depen-dency grammar analysis. 
The basic idea of dependency-grammar-based training set construction is to utilize the dependency relations in a sentence to automatically identify appraisal expressions. of relations to label appraisal expressions, which are  X  amod  X  and  X  nsubj  X . Definition 1 ( amod ). Let  X   X  be an adjective and and  X   X  is valid if there is a modification dependency-relationship between Definition 2 ( nsubj ). Let  X   X  be a noun and 
For example, in the sentence  X  this car has a fantastic shape  X , there is an amod re-modifies the noun  X  shape  X , which is represented as a  X  mod  X  dependency-relationship nsubj relation between the word  X  engine  X  and  X  powerful  X , because  X  engine  X  depends on  X  is  X  with a dependency relation  X  s  X  indicating  X  engine  X  is the subject of  X  is  X . The data sets are from Task 2 of COAE 2013, including two data sets with one about car domain and the other about camera domain. There are totally 9815 sentences in each data set. We use the Stanford POS Tagger to perform the POS tagging on short texts. In addi-experiments to compare our proposal with three existing methods, which are Nearest [1], tives and count of nouns and noun-phrases). 
We compare our method with the three competitor methods in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure. The results are shown in Table 1 and 2. As shown in Table 1 In addition, it has a comparable precision with SPB. The nearest method performs poorly, because it lacks deep ex ploration on the lexical, syntactic, and semantic rela-tionship between words. This indicates that distance-only methods are not appropriate for appraisal expression extraction. Both RB and SPB have a higher precision than the nearest method, since they both employ the exact-matching idea in appraisal expres-sion extraction. However, they both have a low recall because many correct appraisal expressions will be excluded in the result list. also use a classification model to extract appraisal expressions but we introduce a depen-dency-grammar-based method to automatically label training sets, and thus make the luate the performance of our proposal on two real data sets, and the experimental results show that our proposal outperforms its competitors.
