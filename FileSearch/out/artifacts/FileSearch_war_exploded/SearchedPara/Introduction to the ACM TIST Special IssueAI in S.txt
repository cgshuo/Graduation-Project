 Computer technology is leading to sweeping changes in the relationship be-tween AI research and the social and behavioral sciences. Two closely related topics, social computing and cultural modeling, have become especially active and dynamic areas of research. Social computing is the study of social behavior and social context based on computational systems; cultural modeling is the modeling of perceptions and attitudes that are shared across social groups. The research in these two areas promises to provide a deeper understanding of behaviors, patterns, and potential outcomes.

For this special issue, our aim was to provide a forum for interdisciplinary researchers to share their views and report original, cutting-edge research in social computing and culture modeling. Our call for papers elicited a tremen-dous response, and, after a careful review process by international experts, we have more high-quality submissions than will fit into a single issue of ACM TIST. Thus this special issue will be the first of a two-part series.
Four of the five papers in this issue are theoretical and applied contributions that propose novel frameworks and processes for modeling social behaviors and cultures and investigate effective principles and approaches for acquiring, rep-resenting, modeling, and engaging ubiquitous intelligence in real-world prob-lems. The fifth paper is a position article on future directions for social comput-ing and cultural modeling.

In  X  X irtual Worlds as Cultural Models, X  William Bainbridge examines the relationships among online games and theories of society and culture. The work is based on more than 4,000 hours of participant observations involving 13 popular online games and discusses their economic systems, social systems, communication challenges, and the ways in which autonomous agents and semi-autonomous secondary avatars enrich interactive complexity.

Resource selection games are an important game-theoretic model of situa-tions in which agents need to choose among various resources, and in  X  X truc-tured Coalitions in Resource Selection Games, X  Michal Feldman and Moshe Tennenholtz consider a way to introduce social structure into such games. In particular, they partition the agents into coalitions and consider a strategy pro-file to be desirable to a coalition if it improves the payoffs of all of the agents in the coalition. They define game-theoretic equilibria relative to this definition of desirability and characterize the conditions under which such equilibria exist. In  X  X pinion Formation Under Costly Expression, X  Fang Wu and Bernardo Huberman study the dynamics of public opinion formulation in online postings of recommendations and product reviews with special attention to the tem-poral dimension of opinion. The authors X  results show that in the process of articulating and expressing their views online, people tend to follow a differ-ent pattern from that observed in information cascades or group polarization.
Instead, over time, there is a strong tendency towards an average opinion that becomes increasingly more moderate.

There is much empirical evidence that when humans make choices among al-ternatives that have varying degrees of risk, their choices differ from the tradi-tional notion of expected-value maximization. In  X  X volution of State-Dependent
Risk Preferences, X  Patrick Roos, Ryan Carr, and Dana Nau suggest a possi-ble way in which such decision-making behavior could have been learned or arisen evolutionarily. In particular, they show that in several evolutionary-game settings, the interplay between risk-taking and sequentiality of choices gives state-dependent risk behavior an evolutionary advantage over expected-value maximization.
 In  X  X ocial Media as Crisis Platform: The Future of Community Maps/Crisis
Maps, X  Rebecca Goolsby discusses the problems and opportunities raised by the growing use of social media  X  X rowdsourcing X  to address complex problems such as crises and tragedies. As a case study, she discusses Ushahidi, an open-source platform designed for geo-located responses to crises and its recent use in the Haiti earthquake and the Afghanistan elections.

The guest editors would like to thank all of the authors who submitted papers to this special section. We are deeply grateful to all of the referees for their careful work and constructive comments to deliver quality reviews within short timeframes. We believe that this collection of contributions will encourage more innovative research in the areas of social computing and culture modeling.
