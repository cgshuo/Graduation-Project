 The Internet has become one of the main sources of con-sumer health information. Health consumers have access to ever-growing health information resources, especially since the rise of the Social Media. For example, over 20.000 videos have been uploaded by American hospitals on to YouTube. To find health videos is challenging because of factors like tags spamming and misleading information. Previous stud-ies have found difficulties when searching for good health videos in YouTube, including false information (e.g., herbal cures for diabetes or cancer).

Our objective was to extract information about the trust-worthiness of the diabetes YouTube X  X  channels using link analysis of the diabetes online community by developing an algorithm, called HealthTrust, based on Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) for ranking the most authoritative dia-betes channels. The ranked list of channels from HealthTrust was compared with the list of the most relevant diabetes channels from YouTube. Two healthcare professionals made a blinded classification of channels based on whether they would recommend the channel to a patient. HealthTrust performed better for retrieving channels recommended by the professional reviewers. HealthTrust performed several times better than YouTube for filtering out the worst chan-nels (i.e., those not recommended by any expert reviewer).

The main source of health information for people in many countries is the Internet [1, 2]. Many health authorities, hos-pitals and patients are publishing online health information. Increasingly, health information content is being dissemi-nated through social media platforms (e.g., blogs, YouTube, Twitter) [3]. For example, there are hundreds of American hospitals that have uploaded over 20,000 videos on YouTube.
Despite the vast amount of health videos in YouTube, finding relevant online health videos is not an easy task. One of the main problems of health information content on the Internet is finding trustworthy sources that do not contain misleading or bogus information. Sadly, misleading infor-mation such as herbal cures for cancer is very common [4, 5, 6] . In one extreme example, it can be easier to find videos or websites promoting anorexia as a lifestyle than reliable content about this devastating disease[5]. Therefore, there is a need for robust information retrieval approaches that filter out this type of misleading content or spam.
Over the past several years, many different approaches have been applied to assist health consumers in finding on-line health resources [7, 8]. Many different projects and studies are highlighting difficulties in retrieving good health information[7, 8, 9, 10]. A very common approach is the cre-ation of quality labels for trustworthy websites. These web-sites are largely manually evaluated and, in a few cases, in-corporated with automatic approaches, which extract meta-data about content quality [7, 8]. In most cases, the  X  X uality X  of health information has been focused on the accuracy of the information and not other parameters such as likeability.
Manual or semi-automatic approaches face problems of scalability in the current environment of expanding online content and information overload. To our knowledge, link analysis has not been explored to retrieve online health in-formation for health consumers. However, several new Euro-pean projects (i.e., Meco [11] and Khresmoi [12]) are explor-ing new information retrieval techniques for online medical content.

In the area of web information retrieval several techniques have been developed based on link analysis (e.g., Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) [13] and PageRank [14]) and more recently trust-based approaches (e.g., TrustRank [15]). Those approaches are not adapted to the particularities of health information retrieval. For example, it is common that when searching health information, very popular con-tent (e.g., content featuring a celebrity) is highly ranked but it is not relevant from a health point of view.

Additionally, many information retrieval algorithms are designed to avoid the problem of the  X  X ightly Knit Commu-nity Effect X  (TKCE) [16]. In many cases, it has been be-lieved that the links within those communities may decrease the quality of search algorithms. We hypothesize that in the health domain the situation may be the opposite and the TKCE effect is not negative. In fact, online commu-nities of patients can be very effective in filtering mislead-ing information [17]. Our main research question is whether trust-based metrics, such as HITS X  authoritativeness, within a health community can improve information retrieval. We designed a search algorithm, HealthTrust, that is an adap-tation of HITS to increase the effect of the TKCE of health communities.

This paper is structured as follows. In the  X  X elated Work X  section we provide an overview of health information re-trieval and web information retrieval. In the next sections, we present our approach and the evaluation of  X  X ealthTrust X  for finding relevant health channels from the online commu-nity of diabetes in YouTube.
Search engines are widely used by Internet users. Cur-rently most search engines leverage the graph structure of the web, using link analysis as the main source of informa-tion about reputable sites. Most of those techniques are inspired by mathematical graph theory and social network analysis where web sites are part of an interlinked graph.
One of the earliest successes in search engines was the al-gorithm PageRank [14]. In PageRank, a score is given to all Internet nodes based on their prestige, measured by the number of links pointing at the node. The main advan-tage of PageRank is that it can be calculated prior to query time. Another popular algorithm for web search is HITS [13]. With HITS, nodes are given two scores:  X  X uthorities X  and  X  X ubs X . In HITS, values of incoming links are not the same for all nodes; if the link comes from an authority it will have more value than a link from a less prestigious node. HITS needs to be calculated at query time and therefore it is not the best solution for large data sets.

Many other approaches have been tested since the intro-duction of HITS and PageRank, especially to address new challenges of the web (e.g., spamming). Some of those are exploring the trust of the nodes in order to make the rank-ings, such as TrustRank [15]. TrustRank is based on a white list of websites that have been evaluated by experts, so it is not a fully automatic approach.

Health information retrieval is not an easy domain for most web search engines. Reputation based on incoming links can lead to inadvertently highly ranking of harmful content. Polemic content (e.g., anti vaccination, bogus cures for cancer) tends to be highly ranked [4, 5, 6] since this content can have many incoming links for reasons other than having useful health information.

A traditional approach in the health domain is to rely on expert evaluation. Certified websites can get  X  X uality labels X  after a manual review process. One problem of man-ual approaches is how to cope with the current information overload situation and expansion of the Internet, requiring a scalable solution. A few projects are addressing the au-tomatic extraction of different quality features about health websites for information retrieval purposes [11, 7, 8, 12, 9], but to our knowledge none of them have focused on social media and link analysis.

Outside the health domain, there have been several stud-ies of online communities and reputation in YouTube. Yo-Sub et al. analyzed the reputation of end users in YouTube [18]. Siersdorsfer et al. evaluated an approach to predict the ratings of YouTube comments [19]. Dadvison et al re-cently published a detailed description of how videos are recommended within YouTube [20]. However, there are no publications about how is implemented the search engine in YouTube.
Although it has been suggested that  X  X ightly Knit Com-munity Effect X  is negative when seeking relevant resources, we believe that in the health domain, the effect can be the opposite. Relevant health videos in YouTube can be  X  X uried X  under highly popular videos that are not health related at all. For example, a video about a singer who has diabetes will be highly ranked. Our algorithm HealthTrust is aiming at ranking the search results based on the popularity of the content within a health-related  X  X ightly knit X  community. In this study we are exploring the use case of diabetes channels within YouTube.
We tested different link analysis algorithms and configura-tions before designing our algorithm. Of those HITS had the most promising results and therefore we based our algorithm on an adaptation of HITS. The main reason to avoid testing multiple algorithms in this study is the difficulty to engage healthcare professionals to evaluate the retrieved results. HealthTrust is an adaptation of the search algorithm HITS. In the HITS,  X  X uthoritative X  values are calculated at query time and used to rank the search results. In HealthTrust, we calculate the HITS for all the members of a predefined health community. Later, the HITS authoritative scores, which we call HealthTrust, can be used for any query at indexing time.

In HealthTrust, authoritative values will represent the trust on that source within its health community. Our ap-proach in searching content using HealthTrust has several steps. First,  X  X rust X  scores are calculated for all content (i.e., videos) and content providers (i.e., video channels) within the community of interest, in our case the diabetes commu-nity in YouTube. These scores are then used to rank search results of content.

The starting point for the algorithm HealthTrust is a data set with information about an online community (here the diabetes community in YouTube). In this study we extracted all the channels about diabetes using YouTube Search API. To model the diabetes social network, the chan-nels are considered nodes and their edges are the links be-tween channels (e.g., favorite videos, subscriptions, friend-ships). Then, we calculate the HITS authority value for all the users on the community. This value that we call HealthTrust is related to the trust of the health community to that channel source. There were several particularities of YouTube videos that were taken into account. For example, Figure 1: Precision at K (%): channels recom-mended by both reviewers. some channels do not share their favorites or subscriptions or have limited comments in their videos.

HealthTrust scores for videos can also be calculated in a similar approach. In this case, videos are considered also nodes. Favorites and uploads will be edges between channels and videos. Finally, the HealthTrust score of a video will be a combination between the HealthTrust value of the video and its channel. That video HealthTrust score can be used for ranking search results. That possibility is not addressed in this paper, but is part of our future work. As explained in the following section, in this study we are evaluating the cor-relation between the HealthTrust score of a channel and its likeness of being recommended by a healthcare professional.
In this study, we evaluated our hypothesis that HealthTrust scores for diabetes channels would be a better indicator of relevance compared to diabetes channel rankings in YouTube.
In May 2010, using the YouTube API, we searched all channels with the query diabetes. In total we extracted 219 channels, 182 favorite links, 247 friendships, 106 subscrip-tions and 5,133 videos from those channels. These chan-nels about diabetes form a community where members are linked by  X  X avorite X ,  X  X ubscriptions X ,  X  X riendships X  and  X  X om-ments X . Using this data set, we calculated HITS scores of channels using the Java Jung API. Edges between channels were subscriptions, favorites and friendships. We discarded as an edge channels favoring their own videos. We define the intra-community HITS authority score as HealthTrust since it reflects trust of the community in that content provider.
We created a data set with the top20 most relevant dia-betes channels from YouTube search and the top20 channels with highest HealthTrust. These channels were alphabeti-cally ordered and evaluated by two healthcare professionals. The experts evaluated whether they would recommend the channels to a patient with diabetes or not. Two channels were deleted from YouTube by their account owners before the second reviewer analyzed them, so for those two channels we only took into account scores from the first reviewer.
The lists of top20 channels from YouTube and HealthTrust contained 34 channels. 18 channels were recommended by all reviewers, 6 by half of them and 10 by none of them. The Kappa Cohen value of the reviewers was estimated as 0.61 with a lower and upper boundary of 0.34 and of 0.89 respec-tively. A Kappa value of 0.61 is considered good agreement.
We studied the Precision at K (k= 5, 10 and 20) con-sidering that a relevant channel has to be recommended by Figure 2: Precision at K (%) for channels recom-mended by at least one reviewer Figure 3: Spam channels (%) for different lists sizes. Channels are not recommended by any of the re-viewers. both professionals. Those channels represent the most rel-evant channels. As shown in Figure 1, HealthTrust per-formed better than YouTube channel search. HealthTrust also performed better when considering relevant channels recommended by at least one professional, Figure 2. In most cases, the disagreement between the professionals occurred in channels where authors were patients and not healthcare professionals.

Retrieving spam content with misleading information has a very bad impact in the perceived quality of the retrieved results. Therefore, we compared how many channels were not recommended by any of the experts, Figure 3. In this case, HealthTrust performed much better than YouTube. We observed that many spam channels were selling cures for diabetes or were not health related (e.g., Dance remix). Some of those channels were using many tags and different techniques to get higher ranked in YouTube. For example, the tag  X  X onas X  (e.g., a famous singer with diabetes) was used in many videos that had nothing to do with the singer. In contrast, high quality videos from health authorities used very few tags.
There are significant limitations in our study. First of all, we have a very limited data set of evaluated channels so our results are weak from a statistical point of view. In addition, more research is needed to determine if HealthTrust would perform better based on other algorithms such as PageRank. As part of the future work, we will evaluate our approach with more content and patients. That evaluation will ad-dress aspects such as efficacy of HealthTrust for retrieving relevant health videos with a larger dataset.

The results of our study show that there is a significant amount of channels highly ranked by YouTube of very low quality (i.e., not recommended by either reviewer) where our HealthTrust approach performed well for filtering channels with the lowest quality. This finding is coherent with our ob-servations that videos with polemic (e.g., alternative herbal medicine) or funny content (e.g., famous singers videos) are highly popular in the YouTube but not inside the diabetes community. YouTube search, as most information retrieval systems, appears to highly popular content for average users rather than popular content within the tightly knit commu-nity (e.g. diabetes community). Therefore, our preliminary results suggest that Tightly Knit Community Effect may help filter out the worst quality content from a health point of view.

We were surprised by the low HealthTrust rank of au-thoritative channels such as the CDC (Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention). There are many factors involved in this problem. These channels do not promote social inter-actions (e.g., subscriptions, friendship) as many other chan-nels do. Another reason is that those channels are closer to a more general health-related community than diabetes community. To combine trust analysis from different health-related communities and sub-communities can be an area of future research. Moreover, it remains to be seen if our ap-proach will work in health domain where there is not a large engaged community of users linking each other X  X  content. Another problematic scenario will be a sub-domains where there is a big community of users promoting misleading in-formation. For example, communities promoting anorexia as a lifestyle [5].
