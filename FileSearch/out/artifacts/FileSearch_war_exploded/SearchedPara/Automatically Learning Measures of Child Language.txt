 The rapid childhood development from a seem-ingly blank slate to language mastery is a puzzle that linguists and psychologists continue to ponder. While the precise mechanism of language learning remains poorly understood, researchers have devel-oped measures of developmental language progress using child speech patterns. These metrics pro-vide a means of diagnosing early language disor-ders. Besides this practical benefit, precisely mea-suring grammatical development is a step towards understanding the underlying language learning pro-cess.

Previous NLP work has sought to automate the calculation of handcrafted developmental metrics proposed by psychologists and linguists. In this pa-per, we investigate a more fundamental question: Can we use machine learning techniques to create a more robust developmental measure itself? If so, how well would such a measure generalize across children? This last question touches on an underly-ing assumption made in much of the child language literature X  that while children progress grammati-cally at different rates, they follow fixed stages in their development. If a developmental index auto-matically learned from one set of children could be accurately applied to others, it would vindicate this assumption of shared developmental paths.

Several metrics of language development have been set forth in the psycholinguistics literature. Standard measures include Mean Length of Utter-ance (MLU) (Brown, 1973) X  the average length in morphemes of conversational turns, Index of Pro-ductive Syntax (IPSYN) (Scarborough, 1990) X  a multi-tiered scoring process where over 60 individ-ual features are counted by hand and combined into tiered scores, and D-Level (Rosenberg et al., 1987; Covington et al., 2006) X  a score for individual sen-tences based on the observed presence of key syn-tactic structures. Today, these hand-crafted metrics persist as measurements of child language develop-ment, each taking a slightly different angle to assess the same question: Exactly how much grammatical knowledge does a young learner possess?
NLP technology has been applied to help au-tomate the otherwise tedious calculation of these measures. Computerized Profiling (CP) (Long and Channell, 2001) is a software package that produces semi-automated language assessments, using part-of-speech tagging and human supervision. In re-sponse to its limited depth of analysis and the neces-sity for human supervision in CP, there have since been implementations of completely automated as-sessments of IPSYN (Sagae et al., 2005) and D-Level (Lu, 2009) which take advantage of automatic parsing and achieve results comparable to manual assessments. Likewise, in the ESL domain, Chen and Zechner (2011) automate the evaluation of syn-tactic complexity of non-native speech.

Thus, it has been demonstrated that NLP tech-niques can compute existing scores of language pro-ficiency. However, the definition of first-language developmental metrics has as yet been left up to hu-man reasoning. In this paper, we consider the au-tomatic induction of more accurate developmental metrics using child language data. We extract fea-tures from longitudinal child language data and con-duct two sets of experiments. For individual chil-dren, we use least-squares regression over our fea-tures to predict the age of a held-out language sam-ple. We find that on average, existing single met-rics of development are outperformed by a weighted combination of our features.

In our second set of experiments, we investigate whether metrics can be learned across children. To do so, we consider a speech sample ordering task. We use optimization techniques to learn weight-ings over features that allow generalization across children. Although traditional measures like MLU and D-level perform well on this task, we find that a learned combination of features outperforms any single pre-defined developmental score. To identify trends in child language learning we need a corpus of child speech samples, which we take from the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000). CHILDES is a collection of corpora from many studies of child language based on episodic speech data. Since we are interested in development over time, our corpus consists of seven longitudinal studies of individual children. Data for each child is grouped and sorted by the child X  X  age in months, so that we have a single data point for each month in which a child was observed. The size of our data set, broken down by child, is shown in Figure 1.
We take advantage of automatic dependency parses bundled with the CHILDES transcripts (Sagae et al., 2007) and harvest features that should be informative and complementary in assessing grammatical knowledge. We first note three stan-dard measures of language development: (i) MLU, a measure of utterance length, (ii) mean depth of de-pendency parse trees, a measure of syntactic com-plexity similar to that of Yngve (1960), and (iii) D-level, a measure of linguistic competence based on observations of syntactic constructions.

Beyond the three traditional developmental met-rics, we record five additional features. We count two of Brown X  X  (1973) obligatory morphemes  X  ar-ticles and contracted auxiliary  X  X e X  verbs  X  as well as occurrences of any preposition. These counted features are normalized by a child X  X  total number of utterances at a given age. Finally, we include two vocabulary-centric features: Average word fre-quency (i.e. how often a word is used in a stan-dard corpus) as indicated by CELEX (Baayen et al., 1995), and the child X  X  ratio of function words (deter-miners, pronouns, prepositions, auxiliaries and con-junctions) to content words.

To validate a developmental measure, we rely on the assumption that a perfect metric should increase monotonically over time. We therefore calculate Kendall X  X  Tau coefficient (  X  ) between an ordering of each child X  X  speech samples by age, and an order-ing by the given scoring metric. The  X  coefficient is a measure of rank correlation where two identical orderings receive a  X  of 1, complete opposite order-ings receive a  X  of -1, and independent orderings are expected to receive a  X  of zero. The  X  coefficients for each of our 8 features individually applied to the 7 children are shown in Table 1.

We note that the pre-defined indices of language development  X  MLU, tree depth and D-Level  X  perform the ordering task most accurately. To illus-trate the degree of variance between children and features, we also include plots of each child X  X  D-Level and contracted auxiliary  X  X e X  usage in Figure 2. Learning Individual Child Metrics Our first task is to predict the age at which a held-out speech sam-ple was produced, given a set of age-stamped sam-ples from the same child. We perform a least squares regression on each child, treating age as the depen-dent variable, and our features as independent vari-ables. Each data set is split into 10 random folds of 90% training and 10% test data. Mean squared error is reported in Table 2. On average, our regression
MLU All Features MLU &amp; Fn. / Content 0.7456 0.7457 0.7780 achieves lower error than any individual feature by itself.
 Learning General Metrics Across Children To produce a universal metric of language development like MLU or D-Level, we train on data pooled across many children. For each of 7 folds, a single child X  X  data is separated as a test set while the remaining children are used for training. Since Ross is the only child with samples beyond 62 months, we do not at-tempt to learn a general measure of language devel-opment at these ages, but rather remove these data points.

Unlike the individual-child case, we do not pre-dict absolute ages based on speech samples, as each child is expected to learn at a different rate. Instead, we learn an ordering model which attempts to place each sample in its relative place in time. The model computes a score from a weighted quadratic combi-nation of our features and orders the samples based on their computed scores. To learn the parameters of the model, we seek to maximize the Kendall  X  between true and predicted orderings, summed over the training children. We pass this objective function to Nelder-Mead (Nelder and Mead, 1965), a stan-dard gradient-free optimization algorithm. Nelder-Mead constructs a simplex at its initial guess of pa-rameter values and iteratively makes small shifts in the simplex to satisfy a descent condition until a lo-cal maximum is reached.

We report the average Kendall  X  achieved by this algorithm over several feature combinations in Ta-ble 3. Because we modify our data set in this ex-periment, for comparison we also show the average Kendall  X  achieved by MLU on the truncated data. Our first set of experiments verified that we can achieve a decrease in mean squared error over ex-isting metrics in a child-specific age prediction task. However, the results of this experiment are skewed in favor of the learned metric by the apparent diffi-culty of predicting Ross X  X  age. As demonstrated in Figure 2, Ross X  X  data exhibits major variance, and also includes data from later ages than that of the other children. It is well known that MLU X  X  per-formance as a measure of linguistic ability quickly drops off with age.

During our first experiment, we also attempted to capture more nuanced learning curves than the lin-ear case. Specifically, we anticipated that learning over time should follow an S-shaped curve. This follows from observations of a  X  X ast mapping X  spurt in child word learning (Woodward et al., 1994), and the idea that learning must eventually level off as mastery is attained. To allow our model to capture non-linear learning rates, we fit logit and quadratic functions to the data. Despite the increased free-dom, only Nina X  X  predictions benefited from these more complex models. With every other child, these functions fit the data to a linear section of the curve and yielded much larger errors than simple linear regression. The preference towards linearity may be due to the limited time span of our data. With higher ages, the leveling off of linguistic perfor-mance would need to be modeled.

In our second set of experiments, we attempted to learn a general metric across children. Here we also achieved positive results with simple methods, just edging out established measures of language de-velopment. The generality of our learned metric supports the hypothesis that children follow simi-lar paths of language development. Although our learned solution is slightly more favorable than pre-existing metrics, it performs very little learning. Us-ing all features, learned parameter weights remain at or extremely close to the starting point of 1.
Through trial and error, we discovered we could improve performance by omitting certain features. In Table 3, we report the best discovered feature combination including only two relatively uncorre-lated features, MLU and function/content word ra-tio. If downweighting some features yields a better result, we would expect to discover that with our op-timization algorithm, but this evidently not the case, perhaps due to our limited sample of 7 children.
The fact that weights move so little suggests that our best result is stuck in a local maximum. To investigate this, we also experimented with Differ-ential Evolution (Storn and Price, 1997) and SVM-ranking (Joachims, 2002), the former a global op-timization technique, and the latter a method de-veloped specifically to learn orderings. Although these algorithms are more willing to adjust param-eter weights and theoretically should not get stuck in local maxima, they are still edged out in perfor-mance by Nelder-Mead. It may be that the early stopping of Nelder-Mead serves as a sort of smooth-ing in this very small data-set of 7 children.
Our improvements over hand-crafted measures of language development show promise. In the case of individual children, we outperform existing measures of development, especially past the early stages of development when MLU ceases to corre-late with age. Our attempts to learn a metric across children met with more limited success. However, when we restricted our regression to two of the least correlated features, MLU and the function/content word ratio, we were able to beat manually created metrics. These results suggest that more sophisti-cated models and techniques combined with more data could lead to more accurate metrics as well as insights into the language learning process.
