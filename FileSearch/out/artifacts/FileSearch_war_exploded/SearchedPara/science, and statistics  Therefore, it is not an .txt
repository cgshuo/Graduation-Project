 science, and statistics. Therefore, it is not an ideal choice by instructors for students who are interested in or curious about information theory but who do not have the academic or professional background necessary to sustain a successful learning experience.

Like these other volumes, Stimulated Recall and Mental Models is a vehicle for illustrating a particular methodology in order to demonstrate its potential and to show how to design, conduct, and report research according to its theoretical stance and characteristic procedures. The book begins with an over-view of the study itself (Chapter 1); provides a review of the research literature on mental models (Chapter 2); argues for using stimulated recall to uncover the complexity of these constructs (Chapter 3); presents case studies of the two teacher-librarians who represent opposite ends of the continuum of mental models identified through the study (Chapters 4 and 5); compares the two cases to show how stimulated recall revealed the differences between them (Chapter 6); and concludes by discussing the implica-tions of the study and of stimulated recall itself for understanding and applying mental models in teaching (Chapter 7).
 Funded by the Spencer Foundation, the study involved two researchers  X  Lyn Henderson in Australia and
Julie Tallman in the United States; ten female teacher-librarians  X  six in the United States and four in Aus-tralia; and twenty students  X  twelve in the United States and eight in Australia. The researchers ensured that student participants included a Grade-4 boy and a Grade-4 girl in each country, while the other sixteen stu-dents ranged from Grades 7 through 12 (six males and four females in the United States and two males and four females in Australia). The focus of the research was the  X  X  X eacher-librarians X  espoused (before), in-action (during), and reflective (after) mental models, while they were teaching two students individually how to use a computer information database resource X  X  (p. 1). The databases themselves and the tasks for which students used them differed from teacher-librarian to teacher-librarian and in some instances even from student to stu-dent taught by the same teacher-librarian.

Working within the qualitative paradigm, the researchers used a nine-stage methodology with each tea-cher-librarian and her pair of students: for the lesson with the first student:  X  X  X n audiotaped ten-to fifteen-minute pre-lesson open-ended structured interview, followed in sequence by (i) a videotaped fifteen-to thirty-minute lesson conducted in the library, (ii) an audiotaped twenty-to sixty-minute stimulated recall interview individually with the student and then the teacher-librarian, and (iii) an audiotaped ten-to forty-five-minute enhanced semi-structured open-ended post-interview X  X  (p. 6). The longer interviews in-volved the teacher-librarians, who also participated in  X  X  X nformal audiotaped interview[s] of approximately ten minutes X  X  after their final formal interviews to provide any  X  X  X inal reflective comments about teaching computerized electronic database resources X  X  (p. 7). For the lesson with the second student  X  taught either the same day as the first student or between one and seven days later  X   X  X  X he entire process, minus the pre-lesson interview with the teacher-librarian, was repeated X  X  (p. 10). After the data had been transcribed, the researchers coded one set of teacher-librarian transcripts together (to enable them to address issues of inter-rater reliability) and then coded the rest of the transcripts individually and with regular consultation to ensure continuing compatibility, which they attained at a level of  X  X 95.4 percent or more X  X  (p. 12) by the end of the coding phase.

The book X  X  initial chapters are truly impressive. The overview describes a study that is intricate and mul-tifaceted. The authors present its conceptualization thoroughly, with careful attention to detail, and with sen-sitivity to the issues that surround such an ambitious qualitative project. The review of the literature is extensive and thoughtful, leading the reader through the nuances of various conceptualizations of mental models extant in the literature and arriving at insightful and well-reasoned conclusions. The argument for using stimulated recall as the most effective methodology for understanding these basic yet complex cognitive structures is carefully drawn, logically and thoroughly presented, and compelling. A researcher considering an investigation involving either mental models or stimulated recall would do well to refer to these chapters; an instructor interested in having students understand these rich topics could assign these chapters with confi-dence that those students would learn a great deal.

Toward the end of the third chapter, Henderson and Tallman describe their data collection methods in deep and illuminating detail. When describing the details of their data analysis, however, they reflect the practice seen in many general texts on the qualitative paradigm and in many journal articles reporting qualitative stud-ies and their results: devoting only a few paragraphs to the process of coding their data and identifying the patterns and themes that emerged through their data analysis, the authors provide scant information about this complex and cognitively challenging process. While they assure us of the measures they took to ensure inter-rater reliability, they neglect to tell us what their coding scheme was, how they arrived at it, and even whether they analyzed the data manually or used one of the various software products now available to sup-port qualitative data analysis. A reproduction of the actual coding scheme; a description of the procedure they followed to create and use it (e.g., constant comparison); and a discussion of how they identified the specific models they cite in the following chapters (e.g., by frequency of occurrence either within or across the partic-ipating teacher-librarians) would all help the reader understand the methodology more fully and accept the findings more readily. Methodological rigor is the primary criterion for reliability and validity in a qualitative study, and a full methodological report is necessary to demonstrate that rigor.

Without this methodological information, the  X  X  X indings X  X  chapters are less clear and convincing than they might be. Although the authors write sensitively about the espoused and in-action models of their two illus-trative teacher-librarians (Chapters 4 and 5), the relative significance of the dozens of models and  X  X  X ubmod-els X  X  presented in these chapters is unaddressed. Is one teacher-librarian X  X   X  X  X onverbal cues mental model X  X  (p. 109) as well supported by the data as her  X  X  X ecision-making mental model X  X  (p. 110)? Is the other X  X   X  X  X hange agent mental model X  X  (p. 137) as well supported as her  X  X  X apitalizing on motivation mental model X  X  (p. 144)?
Each of these particular models  X  as well as many others  X  is discussed under the same level of heading in the chapters, and it is difficult for the reader to determine the importance and/or frequency of occurrence of any model relative to all the others. A delineation of the  X  X  X evels X  X  of models and a categorization of them in a clear and unambiguous way would strengthen these chapters.
The chapters X  main points  X  that one teacher-librarian X  X  models emphasize  X  X  X rocedural and product goals X  X  and the other X  X  facilitate  X  X  X rocedural and conceptual understanding X  X   X  would also be more compelling if they were buttressed by more methodological detail. There is no discussion, for example, of the differences in the tasks the students of the two teacher-librarians undertook. The students of the  X  X  X roduct goals X  X  teacher-librar-ian were looking for specific information for class projects, while the students of the  X  X  X onceptual understand-ing X  X  teacher-librarian were learning to use a database without any specific goal (or deadline) in mind. Clearly, the differences in the students X  tasks must have had a strong influence on how the teacher-librarians ap-proached their teaching. Without seeing how the authors dealt methodologically with the relationship of task requirements to the teacher-librarians X  activities, however, it is difficult to tell how much their teaching related to their espoused and in-action models and how much it related to the students X  differing needs. Comparisons across general elements of the  X  X  X rocedural and product goals X  X  and  X  X  X rocedural and conceptual understand-ing X  X  models are nicely presented and illustrated in a ten-page table in Chapter 6, but the validity and reliability of those findings are unclear because of the book X  X  limited information about the data analysis.

Chapter 7 inherits these concerns, since its discussion rests on the material presented in the three  X  X  X indings X  X  chapters. Here, the authors link their findings to other research, detailing a series of questions about mental models that have been asked in previous studies and describing how their own findings confirm earlier insights.
More intriguing is their examination of what they call  X  X  X he crux of the role of mental models. On the one hand, mental models can be managed by their users to effect necessary changes. On the other hand, mental models can manage or control their users, thereby resulting in less satisfactory outcomes X  X  (p. 227). Their  X  X  X anaging Mental Models Flow Diagram X  X  graphically represents all three of the mental models they studied  X  espoused, in-action, and reflective  X  and shows both  X  X  X egative MMs [mental models] that controlled lesson(s) X  X  and  X  X  X ositive habituated MMs that liberated lessons X  X  (p. 228). While the attribution of value to particular mental models is questionable, the idea that mental models influence teaching in specific and detailed ways and that such models are difficult to change despite a stated desire to do so suggests many possibilities for future research. The authors X  conclusion that making teacher-librarians (and, by extension, other teachers) aware of this influence and of strategies for dealing with it suggests possibilities for practice as well.
