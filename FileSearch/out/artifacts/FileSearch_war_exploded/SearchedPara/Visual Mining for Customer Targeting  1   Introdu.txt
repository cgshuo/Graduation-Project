 Many data mining techniques have proven to be critical in extracting significant pat-cause graphical representation of analysis results often offers superior results com-pared to other conventional data mining techniques [3]. In the recent customer-centric business environment, the analysis on cu stomer data becomes a major application domain of data mining including visual mining. In today X  X  customer-centered busi-ness environment, customer targeting and segmentation to create value through core customers are major concerns [8], [1]. Targ et market identification, evaluation, and selection are considered to be necessarily undertaken prior to determining specific strategies in corporate. To find target customers, customers have been examined and segmented in terms of their data sources. Many data mining techniques have been introduced to support decisions relevant to customer targeting. 
Most of researches on customer targeting and segmentation focus on algorithms and data sources. The criteria for segmentation algorithms emphasizes how much heterogeneous each group is clustered. As to data sources, segmentation and targeting models have been developed from demographics, psychographics, usage/behavioral patterns, value, and needs based segmentation successively reflecting their managerial implications [1]. However, they neglect the opportunity of maximizing the efficiency that they can get when they consider all kinds of customer information together and discover the relationship between information. Also, customer related databases have grown so large that even the marketers or analysts do not always know what informa-tion might be represented for customer targeting. In addition, existing targeting mod-els and mining techniques for customer targeting are lack of knowledge presentation ability to visualize and present the mined knowledge to decision-makers. Especially for senior managers, visualization tools are very useful because of their quick and easy knowledge discovery without preconception [3]. 
In this paper, we will propose a novel customer-targeting model. The model inte-grates numerous customer data from various data sources. Then, it will derive key information for targeting using data mining techniques and the network mapping method, and visualizes the information using the customer map. We will apply the customer map in a Korean credit card compan y, and derive strategies from customer maps obtained from its data. Customer targeting is finding and keeping right customers, who are profitable and loyal. Customer segmentation is the pre-requisite for customer targeting. It involves the subdivision of the entire market for a product or service into smaller market groups of segments, consisting of customers who are relatively similar within each specific segment [1]. The assumption underlying segmentation is that customers vary behaviors and information, and with respect to the way they perceive and respond to marketing offerings [1]. To find target customers, customers have been examined and segmented in terms of their data sources. Therefore, segmentation methodologies are deeply dependent on their data sources, such as demographic, lifestyle, preference data, and so on. In this manner, segmentation methods are categorized into three groups, that is, descriptive segmentation, value-based segmentation, and need-based segmentation. 
There have been efforts of visualization on customer segmentation. Self Organiz-ing Map (SOM), which is unsupervised neural network technique, has been adopted for customer segmentation. It outperforms in clustering and visualizing data. SOM has advantages for financial, economic and market analyses. It has been used to ana-lyze markets based on customer data, especially to segment customers [5]. 
Mulhern X  X  research is a cornerstone of the proposed visual targeting model. His re-search [4] suggested a combined framework of customer profitability and customer portfolio. He emphasized the importance of segment-based target marketing in cus-tomer-emphasized environments. With the evaluation of profit distribution across customer, he showed how to assess the distribution of customer profitability by visu-ally inspecting of profit curves. Also, he suggested diagnosing a portfolio of custom-ers and determined what factors either cause or correlate with profitability. 3.1 Customer Information Customer data can be classified into thr ee categories: customer characteristics, cus-tomer needs, and customer value according to the content and interaction types. Customer characteristics information is personal and transaction data about a cus-tomer [2]. They include demographics, socioeconomics, life styles and preferences which are stored in customer databases, survey databases, and transaction databases. Customer needs are the non-transactional customer feedback information that in-cludes customer complaints, propositions, claims, and A/S information [2]. One of the major sources of customer needs is customers X  evaluation through surveys such as the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) survey. Customer needs are diverse on products, services, channels, brand image, and price. Customer value is evaluated from the history of customers X  transactions. Customer value is maintained in forms of current value, loyalty, cost, and risk according to business perspectives. 
These three categories of customer data will organize the three axes of the customer map. The goal of customer targeting is value creation through focusing the most promising customers. To maintain or matu re promising customers, corporate should answer what the customers want. Furthermore, the customer needs can be varied on who the customers are. Therefore, we consider customer value with customer needs to resolve targets X  needs and examine their characteristics to catch how customer needs are affected by their characteristics. 3.2 Customer Information Analysis Customer information analyses are unfold ed into customer characteristics and cus-tomer needs. Through these analyses, we extract key information from numerous raw data, which are questionnaires from customer surveys and customer information from internal databases. The extracted key information will be a criterion of customer tar-geting, so it will organize major axes of the customer map. 
As the first step, data reduction is performed because raw data of customer charac-teristics and customer needs consist of numer ous variables. As a data reduction tech-nique, we adopt factor analysis. After checking the correlation matrix of variables, we apply principal component analysis which is one of factor analysis methods [6]. Then, key driver analysis is performed for customer needs. In key driver analysis, we use customer satisfaction (CS) as a dependent variable because it is a requisite of cus-tomer value and each evaluation on customer needs affects to overall customer satis-faction. Discriminant analysis will derive key customer needs which are significant to overall customer satisfaction. We use deci sion tree method, especially C5.0 because customer satisfaction index (CSI) is categorical data which is evaluated by 5 or 7-scale measure in the customer survey. Decision tree method will derive key customer needs of each cluster in order to explain how the cluster may vary on relevant dimen-sions, the derived customer needs. 3.3 Dimension Filtering via Network Map The customer information analysis outputs several key customer needs and customer characteristics. When the number of key information sets to two, only one customer map will be organized with these two dimensions. In the case that many key drivers are derived, it is necessary to detect meaningful combinations of customer needs and characteristics. For dimension filtering, we apply the network method of link analysis. Building network is the process to expose relationship through interconnected vari-ables. 
Key customer needs and characteristics represent nodes in the network. Network-between nodes. However, in our model, the thickness of the link depends on the aver-age of customer value. The network map is divided into customer needs part and customer characteristics part. Each node in different parts is connected with value-based linkage. We select the variables that represent highly connected nodes as crite-ria of visual targeting. The histogram on the node indicates the number of customers on each attribute of the variable. 3.4 Visual Targeting via Customer Map After setting a value component and deriving key factors from customer characteris-tics and customer needs, we visualize the key factors onto the customer map. The customer map evaluates the customer value distribution based on key customer char-acteristics and customer needs. To implement the customer map, we organize a two-dimensional plane using a key customer characteristic and a key customer need. All customers will have their own positions in the space constituted with (x, y) coordi-nates. Then, the value component sets up the third dimension, z axis. The average of the value component of the customers in each position represents the value of the third dimension. When we connect all neighbored points, customer map exposes a form of the contour plot. A three-dimensional graph can be projected into a two-dimensional plane by expressing altitude as colors. 3.5 Segmenting and Targeting Through Visualization Through the value distribution on the customer map, we can diagnose portfolio of target customers and determine what factors relate to customer value. Then, we can derive strategies to increase customer satisfaction of the target by their needs, and to eventually connect their satisfaction to value creation. From the customer map, customer segmentation can be performed in two ways. One is based on market requirements, which are defined with two dimensions of the map: a customer need and a customer characteristic. This market segmentation is denoted with  X  X  X  starting letters in Fig.3. The other segmentation is based on the customer value which organizes the third dimension of the customer map. This value segmentation is denoted with  X  X  X  starting letters in Fig.3. 
With regard to customer targeting, customers are examined in terms of all three dimensions. Target segment is the most profitable or the most cost-consuming cus-tomer group. By the Pareto X  X  rule, target customers are defined as the customers whose z dimension values reach to 80% of altitude on the customer map. In Fig.2, the highest area in the 3-dimensional map and the highlighted part in the 2-dimensional map indicate target customers. 
There are three check points geometrically in the customer map. The height which represents the average of a value component in each position is a measure to evaluate target is, and the degree of homogeneousness of target customers. The distance be-tween targets on the map with same axes is an index which shows similarities in terms of a customer need and a customer characteristic. We applied our proposed model to a service industry especially to a credit card com-pany. The company performs the CSI surveys twice in a year and maintains various kinds of customer information in the data warehouse. For evaluation of our methodol-ogy, we used 3,200 CSI data from two customer surveys. The company updates the value is enumerated based on the dollar amount of card usage a month. The loyalty value is a long-term value which expresses how long and steady the value remains. The risk value is a cost-sided value component which measures the degree of bad credit. 
Data reduction on customer characteristic s especially customer lifestyles derived four factors:  X  X table finance pursuing (q36_2) X ,  X  X ociability pursuing (q35_3) X ,  X  X howing off pursing (q36_9) X , and  X  X aving pursuing (q36_7) X . Data reduction and key driver analysis on customer needs ranked  X  X lexible limits (q4_2) X ,  X  X pecial treat-ment (q6_3) X ,  X  X inancial benefits (q9_5) X , and  X  X oble image (q10_2) X  as key dimen-sions of customer targeting. We adopted the current value and the loyalty value as a third dimension and compared their results. 
We built the network map with the four customer needs and the four customer preferences. Each need was connected to preference nodes, and each link was repre-sented with the average current value. From the network, we found that  X  X howing off pursing X  and  X  X oble image X  are good combination to derive a target because the links between them gives a high-valued link. On the other hand,  X  X lexible limit X  nodes are connected evenly to all preference nodes; it means it will be difficult to detect a high-end target. 
From the customer map built with  X  X howing off X  and  X  X oble image X , we found that current value is very sensitive to the customer need and the customer preference, but the loyalty value is not sensitive as much as the current value. The customer map shows that target customers are pursuing  X  X obility image of credit card X  and this need appears strongly to the persons who spend money to show off. The customers who have consuming behavior of showing off extremely and are very satisfied to  X  X oble image of credit card X  have low loyalty value. Also, this segment is close to the high-end target with respect of current value. This state indicates that those customers are profitable at present, but these profits will not go long. 
We also demonstrated the customer map with  X  X table finance X  and  X  X oble image X , which is somewhat evenly connected in the network of current value, is but not evenly connected in the network of loyalty value differing from other combinations. We found that current value is sensitive to  X  X oble image, X  but the customer need on The loyalty value in this case is a little more sensitive than the first case. We suggested a visualization method, the customer map for customer targeting. Cus-tomer map identifies the homogeneous target groups in terms of customer needs, customer characteristics and customer value. To build a customer map, we classified them into three; customer value, customer characteristics and customer needs. Then, we derived key information which will be major axes of the customer map using the multivariate analysis techniques and the link analysis method. We applied the visual targeting model to a credit card company. Us ing the customer survey data, we derived customer maps and derived marketing strategies toward target customers. 
The visual targeting method that we proposed in this paper has contributions to data mining and decision making in business practices. First, it enables decision makers to segment and target right customers. Second, the targeting method does not end up with indicating target customers; it shows what target customers need and how their needs can be varied on customer characteris tics. It enables decision-makers to derive long term strategies for maintaining targets. Last, it affords them the ability to make a quick observation of the current state and its change of customer distribution based on customer information without preconception due to the visualization ability of cus-tomer map.
