 estimated 403 Petabyte of data has been acquired, equivalent to all printed information ever created before. Earth orbiting satellites, as well as ground, airborne, and underwater se nsors, space observatories scan their environm ent at unprecedented resolutions, giving rise to  X  X ig Science X . The same holds for the life sciences where ge nomic data, high-resolution scans, and other modalities are collected in steadily increasing streams. Social network analysis, OLAP, and stock exchange trading represent further examples, the latter involving real-time correlation of thousands of ticker time series resulting in Terabytes of data to be analysed per single run. Summarized under Large-Scale Analytics we are witnessing an exploding demand for flexible acc-ess to massive volumes of scientific and business da ta sets. Arguably, a larg e class of these massive data is represented by n-D arrays . Consequently, large arrays pos e new challenges to data model-ing, querying, optimization, and maintenance  X  in short: we need Large-Scale Array Analytics . This tutorial introduces to the topic from a database perspective. Aspects addressed include modelling, query languages, query optimization and parall elization, and storag e management. High emphasis will be devoted to applications in  X  X ig Science X , particularly geo, space, and life sciences; real-life use cases will be presente d and discussed which stem from our 15 years of experience with the open-source rasdaman ar ray DBMS and our work on geo raster service standardization. We will highlight requirements, achievements, open research issues, and avenues for future research. Discussion will make use of real-life examples, many of which Internet connected participants can replay hands-on.

The speaker is Professor of Computer Science at Jacobs University. Since 1991 he is researching on large-scale n-D array ( X  X aster X ) analytics and its application to geo, space, and life sciences. He principal architect of the first complete array DBMS, rasdaman. He holds international patents on raster database technology and has received numer ous innovation awards for his work, such as the European IT Prize. He is founder and CEO of a re search spin-off specializing in software solutions for large-scale raster services. In the Open Ge ospatial Consortium (OGC) standardization body he chairs the working groups on geo raster service sta ndards. He is editor of currently 9 adopted stand-ards and several candidate standa rds. See www.faculty.jacobs-unive rsity.de/pbaumann for details.
