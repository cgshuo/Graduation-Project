 In this paper we introduce a game scenario for crowdsourc-ing (CS) using incentives as a bait for careless (gambler) workers, who respond to them in a characteristic way. We hypothesise that careless workers are risk-inclined and can be detected in the game scenario by their use of time, and test this hypothesis in two steps: first, we formulate and prove a theorem stating that a risk-inclined worker will react to competition with shorter Task Completion Time (TCT) than a risk-neutral or risk-averse worker. Second, we check if the game scenario introduces a link between TCT and per-formance, by performing a crowdsourced evaluation using 35 topics from the TREC-8 collection. Experimental evidence confirms our hypothesis, showing that TCT can be used as a powerful discrimination factor to detect careless workers. This is a valuable result in the quest for quality assurance in CS-based micro tasks such as relevance assessment.

Crowdsourcing (CS) platforms offer new ways of collect-ing relevance assessments for IR evaluation and are already used widely [4]. The advantages associated with this plat-form, i.e. low monetary cost and high task completion speed are, however, entangled with a mixed output quality, making the effective use of CS a non-trivial problem. Past studies have shown the importance of careful quality assurance [8], particularly when the task is  X  X icro X , such as relevance as-sessment (RA), and involves financial incentives [6].
Research in quality assurance for CS has been largely heuristic and non-generalisable. Zhao reports in 2012 that only 9 out of 55 studies of crowdsourcing include any kind of theoretical bases [14]. Quality is usually assured with the use of  X  X old standard X  data, multiple answers [5], qualifi-cation tests, honey pots (i.e. questions whose answers are known in advance) or a combination of the above. Such qual-ity assurance techniques can potentially increase the general experiment cost, task completion time, and experimenters X  intervention [2].

We propose a systematic approach to the problem based on spotting workers who undertake the task as gambling. A worker taking insufficient time to complete a task is know-ingly taking the risk of getting a wrong result [9], so we will assume that careless workers (gamblers) are risk-inclined [10]. Therefore we formulate our research question as:  X  X s work-ers X  inclination towards risk, reflected in low Task Completion Times (TCT) in a competition scenario, a good predictor of poor performance? X 
We propose a competitive game where we motivate work-ers to finish their RA task correctly (pushing towards longer time) and fast (pushing towards shorter time). As a result of these two opposing forces, TCTs will become sensitive to the worker X  X  attitudes towards risk and their perceptions of the task and payoff, i.e. workers adjust the time they take to perform a task to be longer or shorter according to whether they perceive the risk of not taking enough time as more or less important than being fast.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows: our game theoretical model is described in section 2, the theorem link-ing risk inclination with TCT is stated and proved in Sec-tion 3. Section 4 describes the empirical experiment where we link TCT and performance, results and discussion are in Section 5. Finally we conclude in Section 6.
We start from a theoretical model based on Game The-ory, which builds on a few assumptions and leads us to our first result, linking TCT with inclination to risk. This result motivates a CS experiment where we check the correlation between TCT and performance, completing our argument for detecting careless workers by their TCT under competi-tion conditions.

Best scenarios, worst scenarios and risk: Attitudes towards risk can be viewed as ways of perceiving utility [10], relative to the probabilistic average. A risk-inclined player perceives uncertain utility as higher than the average, a risk-neutral player perceives it exactly like the average, and a risk-averse player perceives it as lower than the average. Fig. 1 illustrates these pessimistic and optimistic views.
Risk inclined workers are more sensitive to incentives to compete, because they perceive an uncertain outcome as more profitable. Risk averse workers, on the other hand, are more interested in certain aspects of the game, e.g. non-competitive incentives that do not depend on other workers.
The Mathematical Concept of Game: A game, in the context of mathematical game theory, consists of three components: (i) several agents (players), (ii) a set of deci-sions (actions) they take based on a set of strategies, and (iii) an outcome (payoff) which is aimed to be maximised by considering their own and other players X  strategies.
It is important to note that a mathematically defined game differs from gamification scenarios, even though it shares common elements. Gamification involve managing affective incentives, as is the case of image labeling games (called ESP) or Games With a Purpose [12]. These are not necessarily game-theoretical approaches, but they do involve quantifying and managing entertainment rewards in order to improve the work obtained from volunteers. Gamifica-tion has been used for RA tasks in [3], where individuals were persuaded to assess relevance as entertainment. Our approach relies entirely on monetary rewards, and models the motivation of workers as a simple rational principle of maximising monetary gain.

Chicken Game for RA: The Chicken game, also known as Hawk-Dove game [11] is a particular game setting based on time choices, whose characteristics are determined mostly by competition. In the n-player version, a group of teenagers compete with each other for the prestige of being the bravest. They engage in a racing game towards a cliff in their cars as fast as they can, and the player who jumps out of the car the last without falling off the cliff is the winner. Each player chooses the time for an action, and the outcome depends on the times other players chose. A rational player will aim to an optimal trade-off between the two opposing forces of the game, i.e. one preventing them from jumping too quick (competition) and the other pushing them to jump before it is too late (survival). When each player is uncertain about the choices of the other players (i.e. imperfect information), the chicken game can present a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BE), which is an important solution concept in game the-ory. In a BE the strategy of a player is optimal according to their available private knowledge about what the other players would do. Their expected payoff cannot increase by changing their strategy.

We propose a game in which an assessor is paid only if he or she produces a correct RA result. If no other assessor produced a correct result quicker, he or she also gets an extra bonus. This is a similar but inverse version of the Chicken game: in our setting a player needs to choose a time longer than the minimum, but shorter than the other players, while in the Chicken game a player needs to choose a time shorter than a limit (i.e. when they reach the cliff), but longer than the other players.

In our model, time is related to payoff through the prob-ability of a correct assessment. If a worker takes an in-sufficient time, their result will be completely random. In Fig. 2 we represent our model as a probability graph: the condition of taking enough time determines whether the re-sult is random (with probability P R of being correct). If the worker takes enough time to complete an assessment, then other processes involving knowledge, difficulty, etc. de-termine whether the worker gets the correct result (with probability P F ).

The minimum time is uncertain, with a probability dis-tribution D ( t min ). The probability of getting the answer right when taking time t will be a monotonically increasing function: Similarly, given a distribution of times when the quickest worker will finish the task Q ( t ): Expected utility is then: where K R is the value of the quickness reward and K P the incorrectness punishment. Note that the term with K P is monotonically increasing, while that with K R has a maxi-mum. This means that the position of the maximum will only change notably with these paremeters when K P &gt; K (small incentive for competing).
The following theorem links risk inclination to short TCTs in the game scenario, assuming rationality and condition of BE:
Theorem 1. In the BE of our game, optimal times for risk-inclined players will be shorter than those for risk-neutral or risk-averse players.
Proof. A situation of BE is defined by maximal values of U ( t ), i.e. dU ( t ) =dt = 0. From Eq. 3: From explicit expressions for P correct ( t ) and P quick tain the condition for an optimal time t op :
A gambler over-estimates propitious probabilities, which we represent with a convex function P  X  = F  X  ( P ) and under-estimate adverse probabilities, which we represent as a con-cave function P  X  = F  X  ( P ). which we represented as a concave function P  X  = F  X  ( P ). These are the monotonic transforms depicted in Fig. 1. Optimal time for gamblers t g  X  op is calculated wit These monotonic transforms are de-picted in Fig. 1. Using the chain formula dF ( P ) =dt = ( dF=dP )( dP=dt ) we obtain a gambler X  X  optimal time: Since Eq 6 correspond to the maximal gambler utility U ( t g  X  op ), the derivative will be positive for shorter times t &lt; t g  X  op and negative for longer times t &gt; t g  X  op
We know that both F  X  and F  X  are monotonously increas-ing, so their derivatives are always positive. We also know that in the region of high probabilities of being correct and quickest (where we expect optimal times) a convex func-tion will have a lower derivative than a concave function, so dF  X  =dP &lt; dF  X  =dP .

This means that the negative term in Eq 6 has become larger than that in Eq 5 The positive term in Eq 6, on the contrary, has become smaller than that in Eq 5 This means that overall, the derivative will be negative, and therefore t op &gt; t g  X  op . (this argument is depicted in Fig. 3)
I n Section 3 we proved that a risk-averse worker would tend to take shorter TCT than others in the game scenario, because of their perception of the competition incentive. In this section, we devise an between-group study to investigate the relation between TCT and precision in the competitive scenario where the independent variable to be competition setting (with two levels:  X  X ase X  and  X  X ame X ), differing in the description and pay conditions given to the participants. The dependent variables are the accuracy of gathered labels and corresponding TCTs. We make use of Amazon X  X  Me-chanical Turk (M-Turk), as our crowdsourcing platform. It provides a convenient participant pool to draw upon to carry out many tasks, especially relevance assessment labelling. Data Collection: We used TREC-8, in particular the LA Times, FT, FR94 and FBIS sub-collections as our test collection. We randomly selected 35 out of 50 topics in the TREC-8 test set and used the judged articles as a gold stan-dard set, following previous research in the domain, e.g. [1].
Task: We define two tasks, i.e. Base and Game. In both tasks the participants were asked to evaluate the relevance of a set of document-topic pairs. We used plain text to in-dicate the task rather than the original TREC instructions, according to the suggestions given in [7] for M-Turk crowds. We adopt the concept of relevance used in [13] which has been used in previous work in this domain [1]. We followed the guidelines provided in [1] to instruct our workers, e.g. asking for their consistency with their judgement, etc.
Base Task: We asked participants to perform the rele-vance judgment task for ten document-topic pairs. In order to ensure quality we highlighted that random assessment will not work, because we know the answer of a few of the pairs. If they fail to assess them correctly, their HIT will not be approved. We also highlighted that presence of topic terms in the document does not necessary mean that the document is relevant to the given topic. They need to make a decision by considering more than solely this criteria.
Game Task: For the game task, in addition to above, we instructed the worker that they would be competing with a few other M-Turk workers in completing the task. In order to create the conditions of the game, we highlighted that they need to complete the assessment correctly and quicker than the other workers. We also mentioned that the winner will be with rewarded with a $2.0 additional bonus.
Relevance Assessment System: For the completion of the tasks we used a custom-made relevance assessment en-vironment designed to gather the workers X  judgement, while retaining a minimum of graphical elements and distractions. The back-end layer of the system created a set of random ten topic-document pairs from the QRel file and fetched the associated document and topic information from collections and topic files, respectively. It also ensured that workers judge a topic-document pair only once, while each topic-document pair is judged by no fewer than three workers and no more than five. The documents were presented without their title in order to avoid it being used as the only crite-rion. The user Interface (UI) contained a topic, document and closed question (binary relevance; yes/no). Workers were required to log in to the system in order to capture their Worker ID. After workers log in, the UI layer gets a set of ten topic-document pairs from the back-end layer and presents them, one at a time, in the same exact order as they were obtained. The interface also prevents them from s kipping difficult assessments.

Workers X  actions were monitored and logged by the search interface, including the log-in and log-out time to the sys-tem, workers X  as well as their judgement of each document-topic pair. The length of time workers spent to judge a pair was calculated on client side to avoid interference from net-work delay: it is computed as the time difference between the moment a topic-document pair was shown until the as-sessment was submitted.

Procedure: At the beginning of the experiment, par-ticipants were instructed that the experiment would take approximately 10 minutes to complete, though they would be given 30 minutes between the time they accepted and submitted the HIT assignment. They were informed that they could participate in each task more than once.Workers could only accept the HIT if they agreed to a consent form. Subsequently, participants were assigned to one of two ex-ternal surveys ( X  X ase X  or  X  X ame X ). At the beginning of the survey, we describe that all the collected data will be treated as confidential and anonymous. Payment for HIT comple-tion was $1.0. The total cost of the evaluation was $270, including the cost of the pilot studies and some of the re-jected participants, which we consider to be cost-effective. This section presents the experimental findings of our study. To fulfil the conditions of a between-group study, we elim-inated participants whom we found had taken part in the experiment under different conditions (e.g. taken part in the Game task after taking part in the Base task, or vice versa). Out of 235 workers who started the tasks, 200 work-ers completed them successfully (100 workers per group).
Figure 4 shows the box plot corresponding to the TCTs of each of four categories according to their fraction of cor-rect results (precision): 0.2 to 0.4, 0.4 to 0.6, 0.6 to 0.8 and 0.8 to 1.0, and show the distribution of TCT in each cat-egory by their minimum, first, second (median) third and maximum quartiles. across data collections and tasks. We found that distributions of task completion time changed notably between the Base and Game tasks. As shown in Fig. 4 (b), we can see that there is a clear tendency of the lowest performance categories to low values of TCT in the game (competitive) scenario. In the base task scenario, however, the values of task completion time did not seem to bear any relation to performance, as shown in Fig. 4 (a). Therefore, we confirmed that lower performing players react to our game competing scenario by lowering their TCT and hence turning TCT into a powerful discriminative factor.
Normally in settings like the base task, extra information about users (previous performance, background, etc.) or hints about their current performances (previously known judgments, test questions) are used to detect untrustworthy workers. These strategies, however, require settings that are potentially more expensive and/or discouraging for workers.
In this paper we hypothesised that it is possible to design a mechanism based on a game theory model that makes task-completion time an effective discriminative factor between careless (i.e. risk-inclined) and other (i.e. risk-neutral or risk-averse) workers. We therefore designed a CS relevance assessment task scenario inspired by an n-player Chicken game model, where there are two opposing forces: one push-ing towards quickness and another pushing towards correct-ness. We tested our hypotheses with a crowdsourced evalu-ation using 35 topics from TREC-8 collection. Our findings show that the proposed framework allows to use task com-pletion time as a powerful discriminative factor to identify different types of workers. An obvious direction to continue the research on this promising approach is to explore post-filtering methodologies based in risk attitudes inferred from TCT and other indirect data.
