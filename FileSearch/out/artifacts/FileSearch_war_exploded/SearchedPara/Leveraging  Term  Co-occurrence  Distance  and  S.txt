In recent years, with the rapid growing of Web and social media , more and more information exist in the form of short texts, such as titles of news or papers, mi-croblogs, online Q&amp;A sites, and other applications, and it tend s to grow explosively. There is an urgent demand to interpret these short texts effici ently and effectively. However, short texts do not provide sufficient word occurrences , i.e. short text fea-tures are extremely sparse, which hinders the processing of tex t representation, classi-fication and clustering. This characteristic not only would lea d to high computational complexity but also is prone to overfitting problems. Different kinds of feature selec-tion approaches have been put forward to reduce dimensionality in the past years. To be more specific, there are two main methods of feature extract ion. One is feature selection [1,2], which refers to extracting a small number of r epresentative features from the original features and reserve the type of feature. The other is feature extrac-tion [3], which means that new features are reconstructed from the original features,
