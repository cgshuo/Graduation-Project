 The paper discusses the role of redundancy in hospital ward work on the basis of a field study that focuses on the use of paper artifacts supporting healthcare and its coordinatio n. On the basis of literature and direct observations, we ident i-fied different kinds of redundancy, i.e. redundancy of effort, functions and data. Hence, we analyzed how these different forms of redundancy may affect each other and the coordi-nation inside hospital wards. Redundancy plays a positive or negative role depending on various circumstances. This twofold nature defines different requirements for a technol-ogy to support healthcare and ward work by preserving prac-tices linked to paper-based artifacts and by unobtrusively augmenting them with computational capabilities.

The work in the healthcare domain, typically in hospitals, has been observed and analyzed in several studies. Specif-ically, we are interested in the ward work where physicians and nurses cooperate  X  X round the patients X . In the rich lit-erature of this domain there is a stratification of consolida ted lessons learned that should constitute the background for any additional research. In the following sections we sum-marize the lessons which are more pertinent to our research. First, the nature of the work in wards: the punctual but fragmentary presence of physicians versus the more contin-uous attendance of nurses at patients X  bedsides leads to the development of very different kinds of expertise and experi-ence. These are obviously based on the different education of physicians and nurses, and involve different aspects of patients care but they are also mutually necessary to reach the common goal of the patients X  recovery [6, 8]. For this reason, nurses have developed a strong sense of identity and autonomy in their work, and often strive to make their work acknowledged. Second, the ward work is spatially and tem-porally distributed: coordination is required for activit ies to be performed on time, in the right sequence, and in a safe way in respect to their impact on patients. Despite the difficulties that characterize the healthcare domain,  X  e.g. , scarcity of resources  X  coordination is achieved smoothly and often looks spontaneous and natural. On a closer look, it is evident that coordination is the product of a competent use of space; of the artifacts populating it; and of the expe-rience about the effects that every single action performed by every single nurse has on patient care. Paper-based arti-facts, their structure, their organization, and their dyna mic location play a central role as well as their affordance in terms of mobility and manipulation [2,3,6]. Third, the role of technology in the healthcare domain: healthcare require s a difficult combination of information systems that manage the administrative, financial and organizational aspects o f the hospital as a whole, as well as the illness trajectories o f patients and the caring activities of practitioners. Hence , management  X  X n the large X  and management  X  X n the small X  intersect, and possibly conflict since they respond to differ -ent objectives, and granularity of interest [14,29]. Attem pts to introduce technology in the large, even in spite of its cap a-bility to address  X  X lobal X  needs, usually create problemat ic follow ups on the activities  X  X n the small X  [15], i.e., with practitioners X  local needs. In such cases, technology ofte n imposes constraints, impediments, and rules that interfer e with consolidated and effective practices [16]. Part of thes e impositions occur when redundancy is involved in the pro-cess of integration of large information systems and in the integration of small ones within larger ones. Redundancy is one of the phenomena that more often is addressed by digitalization, although in very different ways according t o what designers intend by this term. At the  X  X ack end X , re-dundancy concerns fault tolerance and reliability; theref ore it is usually introduced and maintained. Conversely, at the  X  X ront end X , redundancy typically concerns replication of data or coexistence of correlated data in two or more places. Moreover, redundancy of data seems inevitably entangled with redundancy of effort in producing and consuming re-dundant data. Therefore, redundancy is usually considered a feature of inefficient or superfluously costly information systems and, as such, something to suppress or limit. How-ever, the process of redundancy suppression at the front end tends to disregard the possible drawbacks in the interfaces where stakeholders, both practitioners and patients, inte ract with the information system. In this paper, we will specifi-cally address the  X  X ront-end X  redundancy.

To complete the picture, one has to recognize that tech-nology has evolved in directions that allow to design techno -logical supports  X  X n the small X  that go beyond the more tra-ditional (and problematic) information systems. The areas of ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, and contex t-aware computing are looking for technologies that enable innovative affordances in terms of interaction and new func-tionalities. Specifically, the augmented paper and white-board technologies have been taken into consideration in many domains, especially in healthcare [1, 7], to provide a link to computer networks without disrupting consolidated work practices.

Bearing in mind this background, we set our field study in the  X  X lessandro Manzoni X  hospital in Lecco, Italy. The interaction originated from a conversation between the re-search team and the head of nursing education. During this preliminary talk, we recognized a set of shared interests. I n fact, on one hand the hospital management had previously invested a lot of effort in defining a new organization of ward work. Specifically, they managed the transition from a set of unstructured/informal artifacts to an articulated set o f more structured artifacts with the twofold aim to support ward work more efficiently and to introduce unobtrusive quality verifying tools. This transition was made with a lot of involvement by ward practitioners (including nurses) an d led to new artifacts comprising the current patient record. Nowadays, the ward activities are tightly articulated than ks to this documentation and, due to the adopted participatory approach, this is an integral part of the everyday nursing process. This evolution was made without any direct refer-ence to a possible introduction of digital technology. How-ever, it constituted a good basis to open a discussion on the possible role of digitalization in the ward context. Since t his role was our primary interest, especially in the perspectiv e of the innovative technologies we mentioned above, from the very beginning we declared a clear intention to take an ex-ploratory attitude toward technologies that could preserv e the current artifacts and at the same time that could pro-vide nurses with better support for their activities. This transparency of intentions helped establish a very easygoi ng atmosphere where the exchange of information, opinions, and scenarios was quite natural and profitable.

The following sections report on the outcomes of the study that is still ongoing. First, we illustrate the conceptual framework to articulate the notion of redundancy that we used in our study. The next section illustrates artifacts from the ward we observed and the main processes involving them. Then, we discuss the role of redundancy in the light of our observations and of the previous conceptualizations . Final considerations summarize our experience and outline the next steps of our study.
As soon as we went to the ward setting at hand, we real-ized that nurses X  practices are characterized by an evident amount of redundancy. We articulate the notion of redun-dancy by combining our direct observations in the field and the literature on this subject. This conceptual framework will lead our discussion of the outcomes of our field study.
Redundancy is a word which is usually associated to a neg-ative meaning:  X  X uperfluous X ,  X  X ordy X , and  X  X xceeding what is natural and necessary to reach a goal X  are the common acceptations. Nevertheless, considering the etymology of re-dundancy, we can observe that to be redundant means to come back, to contribute, to increase (cf. to redound); and, only by extension, to overflow. Redundancy, then, is some-thing between  X  X eing superfluous X  and  X  X oncerning repeti-tion X  but it must be clear that what is superfluous does not necessarily imply a repetition and that repetitions do not necessarily bring superfluousness. As even ancient Romans knew, redundancy can assume negative or positive connota-ingly, in this paper, we refer to the term redundancy as the whole phenomenon of  X  X ore data than that which is strictly necessary X  to convey a quantum of information, regardless o f the possible occurrence. We acknowledge that the choice for such a use of  X  X edundancy X  is rather arbitrary. Nevertheles s we find it useful to recognize what can be seen as different (and even contradictory) forms of the same phenomenon un-der the umbrella of a single concept  X  and hence file these manifestations under the same all-embracing term.
Redundancy in human work can regard what is done, who does it and which resources are involved. We will first take these three points of view and then illustrate how they relat e to coordination, through explicit reference to the healthc are domain.
About the kind of redundancy that regards who does the work, Emery [11] argues that it can be obtained in one of two ways. Either by employing more people than are needed ( redundancy of parts ); or by increasing the capacity of indi-viduals by creating an overlap of functions or skills: this i s called redundancy of functions .

Redundancy of functions allows different people in an or-ganization to complete the same task so that they could be flexibly substituted or exchanged as seamlessly as possible according to the current needs. As reported by Landau  X  in the track of classic organizational theory  X  some combina-tion of skill duplication or overlap has as a positive effect  X  X he ability of an organization to suppress error and gen-erate alternative action strategies X  [24]. Corresponding ly, Kohn, Corrigan et al. [19] draw some parallel between hos-pital organizations and highly reliable industries where h igh levels of redundancy of functions play an important role in reducing the occurrence of accidents due to the fallibility of individuals in complex systems. Tjora, treating the manage -ment of emergency calls [35], argues that redundancy facili -tates the availability of functional alternatives especia lly in the light of flat organizational structures. Moreover, emer -gency centers, as any example of centers of coordination [26 ], 1 Indeed, although usually repetita iuvant (i.e., repetition is useful), in his Ars Poetica, Horace writes that  X  X epetition s are not well received X  ( Bis repetita non placent , Ars Poetica 365). rely heavily on shared rules and protocols so that practitio n-ers know what to expect at any point in time. For this to be workable, everyone also needs to know something about the other person X  X  job in order to interpret what they are doing and will need to do.
People usually consider tasks repeated more than once by one or more individuals as redundant work [27]. As a spe-cialization of this common sense concept, we consider redun-dancy of effort involved whenever some task is accomplished either again  X  after the corresponding goal has been reached at least once  X  or by using more resources than necessary.
If the classic (human) resources management is adopted, we could consider redundancy of effort necessarily inefficien t and costly, and hence something to reduce or even to elimi-nate. A more attentive look could also see in redundant ef-fort a clear strategy to improve either effectiveness or safe ty.
A particular kind of redundancy of effort is applied by human beings in communication. As a general rule, redun-dancy serves to make actors involved in a communicative process sure of what has been communicated. Someone can repeat a word to increase the possibility that it is heard by the other person; and likewise the latter can repeat a mes-sage to make sure that what was said by the former has been understood thoroughly. As a typical example of this, con-sider the conventional mechanisms in navy directions pro-cessing [18] where the expression  X  X o you copy me? X  is intended to ask if one has got such a strict comprehension of a message so that it could be repeated word by word. In the same vein, Normak [26] argues that work in coordina-tion centers is characterized by a certain amount of redun-dancy of effort in terms of checking information again and again through the use of a conventional jargon. Likewise, as revealed in the depictive Hutchins cockpit study [17], th e redundancy of effort involved in having more people per-forming the same task at the same time, may add value in creating a robust mechanism for error detection and correc-tion.

We can then see that redundancy of effort caused by more and different actors doing the same thing twice is an inter-esting phenomenon to be investigated in cooperative work. It can either be due to a lack of coordination, or lead to a better reliability of information and fluency of coordinati on, when mutual awareness and at least partial redundancy of functions is involved. The boundary between these contrast -ing natures of the same phenomenon is not always clearly cut. Acknowledging this can lead to some considerations on the role of technology when redundancy is involved, as we will see in some details in Section 4.3.

Redundancy of effort can either be stipulated in an official or conventional protocol, or it can be a spontaneous practic e that is introduced and accepted in the target community for some benefit. In the first case, redundancy of effort is the result of a precise choice of the management to achieve dif-ferent goals, e.g., reliability and accountability. Proto colled redundancy may create discomfort for those who deal with it directly and hence it may be scorned by those who ac-complish redundant tasks since they are not the primary beneficiary of the redundant effort X  X  effects or advantages. This may lead to a risky circumventing of the rules, which in the worst case can thwart the management X  X  needs and also frustrate the workers X  expectations [28]. Management usu-ally asks technology designers to embed protocols (also tho se involving redundancy) in artifacts used along the work tra- X  and hence the criticality of their consequences. The ex-tent to which this requirement is applied can affect the suc-cess of a work-supporting technology in terms of adoption and user satisfaction. On the other hand, spontaneous re-dundancy of effort has to be observed in an evolutionary perspective to understand why spontaneous redundant prac-tices have appeared in the field of work and especially why they have survived the effort to optimize them. In fact, as suggested by the Zipf X  X  least-effort principle [36], peop le try to avoid any additional effort to complete their duties. This must be certainly be true unless, we add, that an ad-vantage is somehow perceived by those who accomplishes an activity. Technology designers could find it difficult to detect these advantages, being outside the user community; they hence must carefully consider if any case of such redun-dancy occurs in the examined setting, and avoid overlooking or underrating its possible benefits.
The third kind of redundancy concerns the resources used to accomplish tasks, specifically redundancy of informatio n resources that is called redundancy of data : this phenomenon happens when in an organization either the same or similar (i.e., pertaining to the same information) data are repeate d in different places (artifacts, information systems, etc.) .
A distinction of redundancy of data in the framework of different information systems has been proposed by Ellingse n and Monteiro [10] by considering the data source or its con-tent. When information is identical in content but located in different sources, redundancy is intended as duplicated information. Duplication may lead to different representa-tions of the same information, especially if this informati on is represented not only in different artifacts but also in dif -ferent mediums, e.g., paper and electronic forms. In this case, as in any other case of duplicated information, the utility of redundancy is controversial. On the positive sid e, Hutchins argues that this kind of redundancy facilitates th e robustness of work since if  X  X ne [...] component fails for la ck of knowledge, the whole system does not grind to halt X  [18]. With similar conclusions, it is stated that the use of multi-ple representations of data increases the fault tolerance o f the system [12]. On the negative side, other authors state that since the same information is documented in different places, redundancy of information is a latent risk: in fact, the information might become unsynchronized or inconsis-tent and lead to misconceptions or other human errors [31].
An interesting case of redundant information mentioned by Ellingsen and Monteiro concerns information that is not exactly the same in content, but is still strongly related an d located in different sources. The authors call this case sup-plementary information and claim that it can be used for different purposes, among which supporting  X  X earning by intrusion X  [25] and playing the role of boundary object [32] across different communities.

These considerations, corroborated by the observations of our hospital ward setting, led us to articulate the notion of redundancy of data as shown in Table 1. operates or has some power or control.
When the same data are reported in two (or more) differ-ent artifacts we speak (following Ellingsen and Monteiro) o f in several points of the same artifact we prefer speaking about replicated data , since they are like carbon copies made by folding back a sheet on another 4 . We speak of correlated data when data refer to (usually two) different entities or concepts, which can be put in strict correspondence thanks to either a causal or functional relationship between them. In regards to redundancy of correlated data, then, we dis-tinguish whether this occurs between different artifacts or within the same one. In the first case, we draw on the con-cept of supplementary data, in that correlated data are re-ported in different artifacts in a slightly different shape to supplement each other according to contexts of reporting and of consulting. In the second case, we speak of redun-dancy from derived data, that is of data that can be drawn by others as, for instance, subtotals that are reported with in the same spreadsheet to make the final totals clearer. Other authors [2,6] recognize the validity of redundancy of (corr e-lated) data over different artifacts. These differences refle ct different purposes and allow for a different degree of mo-bility (bolted whiteboards vs. mobile work-schedules) and of concision (detailed work-schedules vs. succinct white-boards). These different artifacts can be flexibly used to produce overviews, to present different data differently, to reveal work status, to plan cooperation and continuous co-ordination, and also to pass on messages and notifications to provide individual work-spaces; and finalfly, to also facili tate the location of people in the ward. This last claim brings us to consider those aspects of redundancy that can quite ex-plicitly concern coordination of people in a work setting su ch as the hospital one. In this way, we consider two phenomena that are naturally intertwined together, caregiving and th e articulation of caregiving, in order to illustrate the subt le relationship between redundancy of effort and redundancy of data that derive from this entanglement.
Although redundancy can involve individual work too, its meaning and value can be more interestingly discussed in co-operative work, where coordination is a first class concept. As widely discussed in CSCW (e.g., [30]), in coordination it is useful to distinguish between action in the field of work and the articulation work as two distinct and yet intertwine d phenomena. In the healthcare domain, redundancy as a phenomenon correlated with coordination can occur both in the field of work of care giving, and in the articulation work to manage the patients X  illness trajectories [34]; and henc e it involves the workers that accomplish them (i.e, the care-givers). As for the last aspect, redundancy of functions hol ds a particular importance in healthcare, as a typical way to alleviate resource scarcity of hospitals easing a high leve l of effective replacement of practitioners. Redundancy of func -tions is related to coordination since, for this replacemen t to be effective, an appropriate information on the work con-text has to be collaboratively provided. Also when scarcity is not the main problem, redundancy of functions plays a relevant role, since it allows for a shared understanding of practitioners X  practice [27] and can also support them both in achieving better efficiency (resulting in less wasted time of busy clinicians) and in getting fewer omissions (in terms of goals not being achieved and aspects of patient care missed) .
Redundancy of effort and data have an even stronger re-lation to coordination, as one of the most distinctive aspec ts of articulation work is that of being an additional effort in regards to what is articulated, i.e, cooperative work. Ther e-fore, if we acknowledge the role of redundancy of effort in articulating the caregiving, we have a key to also understan d how part of this redundancy leaves a trace in a number of artifacts, and on how redundancy of data is produced and consumed by caregivers. In fact, the very role of the com-posite body of paper artifacts involved in hospital care is to trace the course of the illness, the total organization of work done over that period and the impact of that work on those involved [4,34]. We can then see the phenomenon of redundancy of data as strictly correlated to the twofold purpose of ward paper artifacts  X  accumulation and coordi-nation  X  and, therefore, as a result of the additional effort that cooperating actors make to articulate their activitie s. Furthermore, the relationship between redundancy of effort and redundancy of data is bidirectional, though asymmet-rical: since caregiving is not a totally-data-generating j ob, redundancy of effort does not necessarily imply redundancy of data. Yet, at a first glance, the opposite seems to be always true, i.e., redundant data seem to be a direct conse-quence of redundancy of effort regarding data reporting and overlook an important characteristic of redundancy of data : in fact this can not only be the outcome of information needs (either to carry out or articulate the caring process), or of reporting duties (either for legal accountability or histo rical recording), but  X  even more importantly  X  it can also be one of the ways by which people make coordination possi-ble and distributed over space and time, in order to limit redundancy of effort in articulating work.

To give an example of this peculiar role, we preview what will be outlined more thoroughly in the next sections: in a regular hospital ward, different categories of actors inter act with each other and act over the patient X  X  trajectory accord -ing to their roles and competencies. Two main situations can arise depending on the kind of artifacts that support the basic role of accumulation of information and coordina-tion of activities. A first situation is when each category of actors owns a body of  X  X perative X  artifacts that support and make their daily work possible in its peculiar context of use [3]. As we will see in Section 3, nurses primarily use and information as closely related concepts and hence as synonyms for clarity sake. a care record and physicians rely exclusively on the medi-cal record ; assistants also use their less formal and struc-tured paper artifacts. That notwithstanding, a patient tra -jectory unfolds (and is represented) over all these artifac ts: all of them contribute to its definition and constitute the tool by which practitioners  X  X teer X  it towards recovery and health. In this case the organization complexity of the ward is mainly mediated by correlated data that are reported on operative artifacts acting as sort of hyperlinks to other op er-ative artifacts. The interrelation of the activities of nur ses, doctors, assistants and third parties is then made possible by redounding data across different operative artifacts, ea ch used by a different category. The second situation is when coordination is mediated and stipulated by means of spe-cific  X  X oordinative X  artifacts that have the twofold functi on of accumulating clinical data describing patients X  trajec tory and of also coordinating activities of different categories of workers. In this case, redundancy does not necessarily occu r; however, having a monolithic and non-redundant artifact is paid in terms of reduced flexibility in managing artifacts lo -cally, and in accessing specialized information for local p ur-poses to the local context of use. The most explicit example of this situation for the ward is the Medication Record, a single paper artifact by which physicians and nurses coordi -nate each other in terms of task assignments and execution reporting. For its size such an artifact is quite awkward for practical use at the bedside and, as a shared and mono-lithic resource, the distributed and synchronous activiti es that rely on it are made difficult.

An insightful design of supportive technology must then be well aware of the ways coordination is made possible (and reified) by the whole net of artifacts as well as of the often neglected function of data redundancy entangled within thi s net, so as not to end up by eliminating its beneficial effects in indiscriminately getting rid of effort redundancy from ward work.
In the Winter of 2004 we observed an internal medicine ward at a large hospital serving a provincial territory. We studied artifacts used within the hospital ward and the cor-related processes that involve them relying on data com-ing from four different types of sources: direct observation s, semi-structured interviews, informal discussions, and cr oss-documents analysis. An anthropologist participated in sev -eral conferences between nurses, and he also joined groups of nurses having discussions in corridors, at the reception desk and in on-duty rooms or while they were having more informal coffee and lunch breaks. Some semi-structured interviews, lasting a couple of hour each were conducted with key roles involved in ward work. Practitioners did not seem bothered by being observed and were often willing to spend further time in explaining nursing practices and clin -ical terms to laymen. Consequently, our observations have been as unobtrusive as possible (we did not cover the bed-side caring aspect), but often we had the possibility to pose contextualized questions for further clarification.
The nursing staff is coordinated by a head nurse, whose role is mainly organizational and administrative. All the ward activities are organized around two staff people, a nurse and a health assistant who care for up to fifteen pa-tients. The physicians X  activity at the ward is concentrate d mostly in the morning, during the ward round. Health as-sistants cover only the daily shifts; at night, two nurses ar e on duty in the ward. The task and roles division under-lying this organization is reflected in the physical bundle of paper-based artifacts that comprise the Patient Record (PR)  X  the main documental artifact used in healthcare as the repository for the information that concerns a sin-gle patient [9]. This information is generated by healthcar e practitioners usually from direct interaction with the inp a-tient. It is usually organized into specific categories such as demographic data, medications, and daily treatments. Sinc e healthcare professionals employ PRs for a number of reasons (historical record, as a means of communication among care providers; a legal report of medical actions, healthcare ma n-agement resource and also a means to promote, evaluate and guarantee quality) PRs are extremely complex and contain a number of sheets and reports. Therefore many international and local committees have been established to standardize both caring practices and documents supporting these prac-tices. Notwithstanding this, PRs continue to have many handwritten and mainly narrative sections which then end up by presenting major differences among different settings and healthcare facilities. In our study the patient record can be divided into two parallel records, the clinical recor d and the care record. They both support planning, recording and the unambiguous identification of the patient, but the clinical record refers to the physicians X  primary document a-tion, whereas the care record is primarily used by nurses to document their caring activities, in terms of diagnosis, ev al-uation and treatment of inpatients. These two records are physically separated in that the clinical ones are stored in a dedicated ring binder each, whereas a single big ring binder holds the care records of all the ward inpatients: colored pages separate each patient X  X  record. Although what refers specifically to the nurses X  duty is to be found in the care record, nurses also update most of the reports and sheets comprising the clinical record: during their daily routine work, they accumulate information about the overall illnes s trajectory of the patient and coordinate prescribed activi ties with physicians in terms of feedback and confirmation.
Along with the artifacts comprising the Clinical Record, in the following section we describe the Medication Record and the Laboratory Examinations Form, as well as the ward activities in which they are mainly involved. The Medica-tion Record is an A3 sheet (420x297mm) with the prescribed therapy regimen on a weekly basis. It contains a large grid, divided in two sections: drug prescriptions and drug admin-istrations. The Laboratory Examinations Form is a struc-tured check-box grid reporting a list of the most common laboratory examinations and representing the lab tests pre -scribed on a weekly basis. Data registered in these two ar-tifacts is determined by the decisions that take place durin g the ward round. Every day, from 09:00 to 11:00, physicians and nurses visit each inpatient. During this round, they bring with them a trolley containing all the clinical record s, the care records X  binder, and a folder with the Medication Records. Although they are part of the clinical records of the inpatients they refer to, they are placed in a separate folder since they are used both by physicians and nurses sev-eral times and in different places. Physicians consult them and update them according to the diagnosis and the therapy progress during the ward round or immediately afterwards; nurses consult and double-check the prescriptions at thera py application time. Clinical decisions mainly affect two nurs -ing activities: the drug administration round and the ex-amination booking. Nurses schedule administration hours, taking into account both ward and patients needs. During the night shift, the nurse on duty checks all the Medica-tion Records and accordingly supplies the medicine trolley with all the drugs needed for the day after. The morn-ing nurse who brings the replenished trolley, begins giving the therapies. She consults the prescriptions indicated in the Medication Record, administers the therapy and then signs the Medication Record to signify that medication has been correctly given. If, during the morning ward round, the physician modifies the therapy, the nurse prepares the trolley accordingly for the afternoon treatments that will be administered by her colleague. During the ward round, physicians may need additional information about the pa-tient they are visiting, so they may want either to ask for some laboratory tests, or refer the patient to another spe-cialist. The Laboratory Examinations Form is used for the laboratory tests. The lab test booking is scheduled at night , when the nurse on duty makes a reservation through a web form to the laboratory involved.
According to the physician X  X  decision, the nurses also up-date their own documentation: the official care records and an unofficial artifact that they call Daily Work Sheet. In the following section we outline both artifacts. The main aim of the care record keeping is twofold: it regards both the planning and recording of nursing assistance. Since the planning derives from a continuous process of assessment of patient problems and of treatment outcomes, all the caring activities carried out by nurses in the ward must be clearly recorded and signed by the provider. Next, we report on the main parts of a care record. The care plan is documented as it unfolds with the Planning Sheets, by which the care that the patient should receive on a daily basis is specified including but not limited to diet, medications, hygiene ac-tivity, and treatments. The Planning Sheet is then a sort of spreadsheet with multiple rows and columns by which the nurses develop a care plan for each patient usually within 24 hours after the patient enters the ward. This worksheet has a row for each planned activity, so that the planning process is well represented by the incremental filling in of the form throughout the patient X  X  stay in hospital.

During integration of the Planning Sheets, nurses also compile a nursing diary on a daily basis. In the Progress Notes Sheets, nurses use narrative notes to chronologicall y chart the patient X  X  progress, any significant events, and th e specific actions that have been taken in order to activate and implement the plan. Notes are free-text descriptions but they are tabulated to facilitate the referencing with a planned activity and to prompt date, shift and author reg-istering. Although most of what nurses document can be found elsewhere more easily, i.e., in forms and charts of the patient record regarding such information officially, nurse s find it convenient and useful to also report on planned or scheduled tests, procedures, or regimens of care here. Besides the official care record, nurses employ also a Daily Work Sheet. This sheet tabulates the list of the ward beds, so that each row corresponds to an inpatient. Daily Work Sheets are usually stapled together and grouped by week, so that the nurse can easily have a complete overview of the ward at hand. This artifact has manifold functionalities. O n one hand, these sheets are a sort of clinical data buffer, in that, unlike the official records, the nurse can easily bring them with her any where she goes; therefore nurses can use Daily Work Sheets to jot down, even at the patient X  X  bed-side, clinical data such as body temperature, pulse or blood pressure, before reporting them into the official documenta-tion (i.e., the graphical records of the clinical record). O n the other hand, these sheets can encompass unstructured nursing observations, and hence allow nurses to jot down various remarks and comments relating to the patient. In other words, as Daily Work Sheets are grouped by week and hence allow a quick glance at all the ward patients, they are also used as a convenient reminder of particular events and as shared agenda for all the ward staff members in next shifts. For instance, during the ward round, if a physician r e-quests an examination that requires a specific preparation, this information is usually noted down in the Daily Work Sheet (besides being registered in the Planning Sheet) to re -mind the colleagues of the following shifts  X  X rs. Smith no food for Gastroscopy X . Moreover, although the official docu-mentation tends to cover every detail of nursing and caring, nurses tend to make narrative charting both in the Progress Notes Sheets and in the Daily Work Sheets. This is done for two crucial activities that take place at the end of the work shift: synchronization of official documentation with ward work and for the handing-over conference. The syn-chronization between ward work and official documentation takes up the last thirty minutes of the nurses X  shift. For each patient, the nurse runs through all the different sec-tions of the healthcare documentation, the clinical record and the care record, and scrupulously checks that activitie s to be done have been accomplished, that the documentation is aligned with activities and their outcomes, and that all t o-do activities are in the proper sheets or otherwise signaled to the incoming staff. In this way, the nurse summarizes what she has done within the Progress Notes and, more gener-ally, what she has been accountable for in her shift. During the handing-over conference, which is when the nurse going off duty and the nurse taking her place in the succeeding shift meet each other, practitioners sit down, with the docu -mentation. The nurse who is going off duty summarizes the most relevant information to the colleagues who are coming on duty. They exchange all the information pertaining to patients X  health, and discuss both the activities that have been accomplished and the tasks to be done: the entering staff (i.e., a nurse and her health assistant) receives outli nes about new or staying patients they will have to attend to.
The main problem in studying the practices we observed was to understand the role of redundancy in ward work and coordination. In the light of this objective, the analysis o f the whole phenomenon of redundancy reported in Section 2 has allowed us to: on one hand to discriminate between as-pects of the articulation work that would be overlooked at a coarser grain of analysis; on the other hand to make some considerations on the risks of overlooking these details in respect to the deployment of new technologies in support of both work and articulation work. In fact, the analysis of rea l work settings must detect a balance struck between inter-ests of efficiency and safety [27] in order to let coordination reduce only the repetition of tasks. During our reflections with ward practitioners it was natural to discuss the effects of the digitalization of the Patient Record, a theme they are very sensitive to. This had the effect of establishing a link between their experience and the results documented in the literature, and more importantly, to define a mutually understood point of view in envisaging the role of technol-ogy in ward work. Expectations about the Patient Record (especially in its computer-based form) regard a wide spec-trum of themes: e.g., a better decision making process, the achievement of better medication management, of an im-proved resource utilization and, in the case of Computer-Based Patient Record (CBPR) an almost total elimination of redundancy, especially of effort and data, in order to help people focus their attention on the most important tasks [9] . Redundancy of effort is obviously seen as a luxury that mod-ern hospital systems can simply not afford in the light of the constant scarcity of resources and job turn over it has been experiencing in the last decades. Redundancy of data, also as a consequence of the limitations of the paper record [21], is seen as a possibly dangerous source of inconsistency and misalignment of critical data regarding the patient X  X  heal th. As a consequence of redundancy implied by paper-based record-keeping duties [13] care providers are often seen (a nd see themselves) as  X  X rowning in paperwork X  and hence hail-ing a computer-based system in which information is entered once and instantly distributed to whoever needs it. As ar-gued by other influential authors (e.g., [9]), when health-care practitioners are relieved of more secretarial tasks, they would also be relieved of an alienating and disrupting part o f their work that diverts them from more personal and human relationship with patients, i.e., from what Anselm Strauss has suggestively defined as  X  X entimental work X  [33]. While accepting the assumption that technology can improve work quantitatively, one of the most critical points in design is to assess whether it can also do the same qualitatively. While we agree with the fact that redundancy of data can bring a potential risk (e.g., inconsistency among data) with itsel f, we think that more attention should be paid when redundancy concerns redundant work. Our setting reveals two cases in which redundancy plays an important role and gives us some clues that, by eliminating redundancy of effort with the clea r aim to reduce secretarial work, an undesirable effect on sen-timental work and correlated processes could occur. These two cases regard one of the most important coordinative moments in nursing work and an important moment of co-ordination between physicians and nurses: respectively th e handing over conference and the physician X  X  order entry.
Three main management strategies make it possible for each nurse to be substituted by any other in any given shift: the first two are redundancy of functions  X  X specially in terms of sharing the same competencies and language con-ventions; and frequent and close work shifts, since nurses  X  being on duty in several shifts within the same week  X  end up by sharing a  X  X ist knowledge X  about all the aspects of the ward status. However, a comprehensive knowledge of the details concerning the ward patients X  trajectories can be obtained only from a third factor: a thorough handing-over conference. This was made clear from observing the pro-cess of the Progress Notes recording. The Progress Notes give an impressive example of advantages entangled with re-dundancy which supports coordination in terms of context sharing. In fact, what nurses report in an almost completely narrative manner in these sheets  X  when they summarize their work shift a few minutes before the handing over con-ference begins  X  may be found also in artifacts comprising the clinical record, although at different levels of abstrac -tion (for instance, information regarding more specificall y the particular apparatus and the disease rather than the id-iosyncratic inpatient as a whole person). Because of these slight but important differences, Progress Notes Sheets de-serve special attention. In fact, during our informal inter -views the head nurse observed that, although the Progress Notes Sheets could be compiled quite succinctly as it is sup-posed for any other formal document, every nurse was used to writing long and narrative accounts of what happened in the ward during her shift and, more importantly, to writing pieces of information that would become useful only in the next shifts. This apparent contradiction was clarified dur-ing the direct observation of what happens before and dur-ing the nurse meeting when the handing-over takes place. As hinted in the description of ward activities, each shift ends with the alignment of legal documents with the activ-ities accomplished in the ward and with the corresponding synchronization of the various documents together with the nurses X  Progress Notes Sheets. This synchronization proce ss precedes and we could venture to say constitutes a  X  X ondi-tio sine qua non X  of the handing-over conference. In this meeting, redundancy plays a specific role for all the involve d players: the leaving nurses, the incoming ones and the healt h assistants. The accurate noting of Progress Notes may seem a form of supplementary redundancy that requires a super-fluous additional effort for nurses: on one hand this is quite a time consuming activity and on the other hand the usually poor legibility of handwriting undermines the usefulness o f this task across different work shifts. As observed in [22], this additional effort is not superfluous at all: in fact, the time the leaving nurse spends in producing this supplemen-tary information is not intended to produce a report to be used by others but, on the contrary, her effort helps her in organizing past events in her mind, and consequently in be-ing more aware of the most crucial events that happened in the ward and their context. Hence the leaving nurse is more focused during the meeting, when she is supposed to up-date the other conference attendees for any current changes in patients X  conditions, by making a continuous reference t o what she has previously written in the Progress Notes. In this way, the most coordinative moment of ward work hap-pens as quickly as it does but as precisely as it needs to be to effectively share  X  X he same context X  of the ward, so that the care process as it is perceived by the patient is affected as little as possible by the shift rotation. On the basis of this brief account, also the nurse coming on duty usually jots down some notes on the Daily Work Sheet to support her work and the next handing-over conference. This is also a form of redundancy, since several pieces of information ar e reported in other documents, although, again, sometimes in a different context. In other words, we claim that this writ-ing supports coordination by improving context sharing. To this aim, sometimes specific and conventional signs are used to augment the efficiency and effectiveness of record keeping. The same phenomenon happens for health assistants: how-ever, since no official counterpart of the Daily Work Sheet exists for them, they use occasional pieces of papers in thei r pockets as artifacts supporting their memory. In the above description of all the activities related to the shift chang e, we have a clear example of the redundancy of data and also of effort, which is spontaneously managed by all involved actors, regardless of their specific role, competencies and skills.
The Physician Order Entry (POE) is the process by which physicians prompt and start any caring trajectory and med-ication use in the ward. Order entry can regard both med-ication prescriptions and the ordering of laboratory exami -nations. The ordering process involves physicians, pharma -cists, third party specialists, and obviously nurses. On on e hand, the nurses have to transcribe orders in hospital inter -nal forms and send them to the involved services; and, on the other hand, they have to administer medications and to doc-ument their activity properly on proper forms. Coordina-tion between all the involved worker categories is stipulat ed and mediated both by shared coordinative artifacts with a function of boundary objects [32] and by a scattered net of other operative artifacts acting as local supports for acti v-ity. For example, the Medication Record mediates the strict coordination between the ordering physician and the admin-istering nurse: marks jotted down by physicians represent triggers for nurses activity; notes by nurses in the corre-sponding blanks represent official feedbacks that report the accomplished task. Conversely, coordination between nurs es and third service staff occurs by means of informal phone calls and of other internal hospital forms. Redundant data reported across this net of different artifacts are then the w ay by which practitioners link and articulate their activitie s to-gether but they also lay the ward work open to possible inconsistency problems. On the other hand, in medication use there is an obvious and urging need to avoid mistakes or drug misuse that raises serious concerns leading to various safety measures [19, 23]. An obvious and widely adopted measure is to introduce checking and double checking in critical situations in order to rely on a protocolled form of redundancy of effort. An alternative measure that has been quite widely discussed in literature so far is the Computer-ized Physician Order Entry system (CPOE), i.e., a technol-ogy that requires the physician entering orders for patient care directly in a computer-based system, thus eliminating transcription mistakes. In the ward discussed in this paper the process is still paper-based. Paper order forms of the of -ficial documentation (Laboratory Examinations Forms and Medication Records) are compiled by a practitioner (usuall y a physician or an accountable nurse); then the head nurse may check whether the request matches availability, by con-sulting the current Medication Records in the drug ward storeroom. In doing so, she also checks ordering with the general therapy context and can hence detect possible devia -tions; then due drugs orders are written again in the interna l forms of the hospital and these are read by some clerk of the pharmacy or laboratory staff. An automatic POE would not only relieve health practitioners from the effort of recopyi ng the order but it would also eliminate the direct involvement of the pharmacy or third party services staff  X  at least at the level of the single order entry  X  thus resulting in an elimination of a redundant effort. The observation of real practices showed that this would be a seeming benefit; in fact, automated order processing requires the information , which is supplied only once to computers by practitioners, to be as precise and complete as it can be; this can lead to unexpected and even novel kinds of mistakes [5,20]. Then, eliminating a redundant access to information requires mor e preciseness and completeness of information, whereas it is exactly redundancy  X  in terms of double checking for pos-sible unclear or left out information  X  that allows practi-tioners to be flexible in managing incomplete information and to manage more smoothly possible lack of precision of information provided. Here a clear balance between tech-nologies oriented to the complete or partial elimination of negative redundancy of effort and technologies that tend to preserve positive redundancy both of effort and data is to be sought and found. In our specific case, this means that a technology like CPOE should  X  while guaranteeing suffi-cient safety  X  relieve nurses of mere secretarial work and, at the same time, preserve and support the collaborative nature of medication use by improving mutual awareness among all the health practitioners involved.

The twofold role of technology in reducing  X  X ad redun-dancy X  while preserving or even supporting  X  X ood redun-dancy X  leads us to discuss its entanglement with hospital ward work in a little more detail, in the light of insights that could help in discerning between the good and  X  X ad X  use of redundancy.
During our interaction with practitioners and direct talks with the head nurse of the ward, we acknowledged three dif-ferent roles technology may play in respect to redundancy towards caregiving and its articulation The first one is the most intuitive one: technology can relieve people of addi-tional efforts they make to complete their work. This is undoubtedly true in cases where nurses are merely to copy data from artifacts without any further fruitful elaborati on (redundancy of duplicated or replicated data). For example , under this category the replication of inpatients names and dates on each sheet of the Daily Work Sheets falls.
The second role of technology is to preserve the usefulness of redundancy while reducing its drawbacks. In the light of the considerations reported in the previous sections, this can be rephrased in terms of the role of paper in the ward work and its coordination. Hence, one could wonder which tech-nology would be able to preserve common and paper-based practices such as shorthand noting, and at the same time to provide additional functionalities such as data consisten cy checking across the net of artifacts employed during the war d work. Digitally augmented paper (i.e., regular paper sheet s written with regular ball-pens embedding a computational device) can be a possible way to go. This technology was at length discussed with the head nurse. She pointed out that the ward artifacts are mostly compatible  X  and also backward-compatible  X  with such technology since they are characterized with the presence of specific fields where most of the clinical information is recorded. This information, moreover, often takes the form of simple and easily recogniz -able signs (digits, marks, checks, crosses, etc.). This how ever does not cover all cases: a full use of the augmented paper technology would imply a change in writing practices that would require nurses to write in capital letters to overcome the serious constraints of hand-writing recognition. This shortcoming and the fact that ball-pen technology is mainly an input technology (with just poor output functionalities ) makes its deployment difficult in real settings for intensive and pervasive use. Considering the case of the handing-over conference and the nature of the involved redundancy, any kind of digitalization seems inappropriate. However, we ca n observe that the adoption of the above mentioned technol-ogy is  X  X ractically X  compatible with the paper-based prac-tices: nurses can either use or not use the digital pen (pos-sibly even  X  X urned off X ) without disrupting the effectivenes s of the conference. In regards to preserving redundancy of correlated data  X  whatever input technology has been de-ployed  X  the back-end technology should also be able to first recognize and then to aptly cope with correlated data and hence must be inspired by some sound model of cor-relation between clinical data. In some cases, this is quite straightforward since correlation can be easily made expli cit in a sufficiently formal way in order to be conceived algorith-mically: for example, the computation of partial and total balance of fluids on the graphical records of the Medication Record; or the correlation between date of birth and age on the admission sheets. These are typical cases of derived dat a redundancy. In other situations, the correlations can not b e that easily formalized, unless they refer to recurrent rule s or shared practices. For example, consider the relationshi p speaking of  X  X yrexia X  (high fever). Here the role of technol -ogy is by no means to substitute or constrain human action (for instance by suggesting medical deductions  X  X yrexia  X  inferred by vital parameters  X  the probed temperature) but to help the caregiver by notifying her of possible deviation s, oversights and omissions, according to the above rules and shared practices and hence leaving the decision to integrat e such recommendations in her accounting for the accountable nurse.

Oddly enough, the third role of technology we identified is  X  after those of reducing and preserving redundancy  X  about how it can even increase the amount of redundant data among different artifacts while relieving practitione rs of the redundant effort of writing. This automatic generation of redundancy would aim to promoting awareness of ward work status to facilitate nurses X  coordination, for exampl e by supplying the same and correlated data in different places si -multaneously, either on personal devices (e.g., pagers, pa lm-tops) or in shared public ones (e.g., whiteboards). In such cases, technology may then be useful to reduce redundancy of effort due to lack of coordination. An example of this regards the management of order entry concerning diagnos-tic procedures the patient should undergo. In the ward at hand, diagnostic tests are prescribed by physicians by means of forms (quite similar to the Laboratory Examina-tions Forms described in Section 3.1) that are transcribed into internal hospital forms. These are then sent to the proper hospital service so that examinations are scheduled . This paper-based practice can lead to problems and con-flicts, e.g., when two examinations requested by the physi-cian either are scheduled in overlapping hours or require in -compatible preparations of the inpatient (e.g., when an ex-amination needing the patient X  X  fasting occurs on the same day of an examination with contrast media). Usually assis-tants of the service that will perform the test come to the ward to pick up the inpatient to be taken to the examination area. Whenever the patient is not available  X  e.g., involved in another examination  X  the assistant has to reschedule the examination and return again to pick up the inpatient. This clearly redundant effort has no payback and it is a negative phenomenon due to a lack of coordination. An example of a technology that could resolve this lack of coordination wit h the spread of information across the ward could be a set of digital whiteboards connected with the paper-based aug-mented artifacts. These displays would gather information flows coming from the different artifacts and modulate them in a proper way (e.g., accordingly to location or practition ers before them). This possibility was welcomed by the prac-titioners since it would allow for the return of the use of a whiteboard that was eliminated for reasons of privacy (sinc e the ward is always open to the public). Tuning and modulat-ing information presented according to the place where the board is located  X  and possibly to who is standing in front of it  X  overcomes the privacy concerns while still allowing for a specialized use of the artifact. Another possibility t hat the head nurse mentioned is about a technology that would help her to track the learning progress of a novice during her apprenticeship. This hinted to us the provocative vi-sion of a  X  X edundancy generating X  use of technology. In fact, the technology would facilitate the emergence of a rea l redundancy of functions within the ward by reducing the possibility that a novice would be considered ready with-out a precise awareness of what she has actually performed during her training course. One of the problems that the head nurse has to face in these cases is the scheduling of caring activities that a novice could not be able to accom-plish unless assisted by an experienced colleague. Novices affect the redundancy of functions a ward staff can rely on, since they could not have all the skills needed to adequately replace her colleagues. As we discussed with the head nurse, the technology of augmented paper and digital pens could be fruitfully employed to let each novice track down in a proper  X  X ctivity form X  which tasks she is able to perform autonomously. In this way, the novice gets a deeper aware-ness of her growing level of competencies; while, on the othe r hand, the head nurse also has elements on which to plan job assignments and specific interventions in order to fill in the gaps in the novice X  X  training.
The paper presented the outcomes of a field study whose aim is to understand the role of paper-based artifacts in war d work. Since ward documental activities are characterized b y various kinds of redundancy, we have analyzed it in order to characterize its role in caring practices and coordinati on. The study focused on how nurses operate in the ward and how they coordinate their activities among themselves as well as with physicians and other departments. Moreover, the study came after a reorganization process in the ward in which the hospital management and the care providers co-operatively re-designed the structure of the paper-based a r-tifacts in use. This reorganization and the awareness about ward practices that this process entailed, constituted a fa -vorable background to open a discussion about the com-plexity of ward work in the specific setting and about the requirements of a technology to support care giving. This informal reasoning pointed out the key role of paper affor-dances in supporting nursing also in non-trivial or obvious manners. Since the technology of augmented paper could preserve the use of paper-based artifacts and, at the same time, could augment paper with computational capabilities , we intend to continue the study by carrying out an incre-mental and participatory design of a system exploiting this kind of technology. Consequently, a second step of our study will begin to encompass the deployment of a prototype that will then be assessed by ward practitioners. This prototype will aim to relieve practitioners from negative redundancy drawbacks, while also addressing the more complex and sup-plemental functionalities related to the positive aspects of redundancy, as discussed in the previous sections. Insight s derived from specifically addressing the role of redundancy will lead our efforts to stretch the boundaries between sup-port and intrusion, until the changes of habitual practices become unmotivated or they are not sufficiently rewarded by the supportive technology.
