 1. Introduction
Thus far, insufficient attention has been paid to the ways in which people articulate problems they face when moving in the World Wide Web. Similarly, we lack a detailed picture of how they invent ways to continue Web searching in problematic situations. In particular, the findings of qualitative research are pat-chy thus far.

In the present study, these questions will be approached by drawing on the ideas of the Sense-Making theory that provides general methodological tools to explore how people face discontinuities or gaps in their everyday action and how they bridge these gaps in order to make new sense ( Dervin, 1983, 1992 ).
An indication of the wide applicability of the Sense-Making theory is that it has been used to study com-munication and information seeking of specific groups such as blood donors, cancer patients and pregnant, drug-addicted women ( Dervin &amp; Frenette, 2003, pp. 246 X 248 ). In the present study, we focus on people interested in seeking information for self-development, for example, hobbies.

Even though we focus on a rather specific area, that is, information seeking occurring in the Web, the issues explored in the present study are not less relevant than those analyzed in earlier Sense-Making stud-ies. Thus, our study does not trivialize Sense-Making theory by focusing on too narrow a slice of everyday action. Importantly, we extend the range of Sense-Making studies because to our knowledge, the Sense-
Making theory is applied at the microlevel for the first time in the field of Web searching studies. By approaching Web searching in terms of gap-facing and gap-bridging suggested by the Sense-Making theory, a new viewpoint can be provided to the discontinuous and context-sensitive nature of Web searching. In particular, the concepts of gap-facing and gap-bridging seem to relevant when studying the ways in which people choose search tactics as the Web search evolves. In this study, both quantitative and qualitative fea-tures of Web searching are explored. The study addresses three research questions: 1. What kinds of discontinuities or gaps do people face when searching information in the Web? 2. What kinds of tactics do people use to bridge various gaps stopping the Web search process? 3. In which ways are the characteristics of gaps related to search tactics used in gap-bridging?
Because the range of issues to be dealt with in the study is really broad and our study is explorative, some limitations are necessary. First, no attempt will be made to define any  X  X  X eneral logic X  X  of Web searching processes by exploring, for example, the sequences of individual search tactics such as following hyperlinks and using search engines (cf. Wildemuth, 2004 ). Second, the relationships between gaps and search tactics will not be analyzed statistically. Main emphasis is laid on qualitative study; a quantitative review mainly serves the needs of giving background to it. Third, no attempt will be made to scrutinize the processes of relevance judgment of hyperlinks and activated Web pages, or the decision criteria of accepting or rejecting hyperlinks and Web pages as the search process evolves (for these issues, see Fitzgerald &amp; Galloway, 2001;
Rieh, 2002; Wang &amp; Soergel, 1998 ). Fourth, the effectiveness or success of individual search tactics will not be discussed in detail. 2. Literature review
Since the mid-1990s, a growing number of empirical studies have focused on ways in which users belong-ing to various groups use the Web to search for information (for a general review, see Hsieh-Yee, 2001 ).
The groups include children ( Bilal, 2000, 2001, 2002; Hirsh, 1999 ), students ( Fidel et al., 1999; Ford, Miller, &amp; Moss, 2001; Pharo, 2002; Wang, Hawk, &amp; Tenopir, 2000; Watson, 1998 ), novice and experienced users tingdon, Williams, &amp; Dobrowolski, 2004; Rieh, 2004; Spink, Wolfram, Jansen, &amp; Saracevic, 2001 ). In these studies, attention is paid, for example, to the number of search terms used, the use of Boolean operators, the ways of navigating and browsing, the success of searching and the problems faced during the search of methodological studies suggesting tools for the analysis of Web searching has remained low. A notable exception is Pharo and Ja  X  rvelin  X  s (2004) article suggesting the  X  X  X earch situation transition method X  X  which identifies a number of categories and attributes affecting the Web information search process.
In an early study focusing on browsing strategies on the Web Catledge and Pitkow (1995) showed that activating hyperlinks and the  X  X  X ack X  X  command were by far the preferred methods of traversal. Similar re-sults were obtained by Kari (2004) drawing on the empirical material gathered for the present study. In his study, searches conducted by 15 individuals were analyzed. The study revealed 20 diverse search tactics for moving around the WWW. Of these tactics, linking (clicking on a hyperlink) appeared to be most popular since about 45% of Web pages visited by the informants were activated by this method. Also the use of the
Back button (about 25% of all pages visited) was quite frequent. In contrast, searching, that is, executing a query with a search engine was not favored since only 8% of the Web pages were activated by using this method. Other tactics such as entering a URL in the address box were used less frequently. Also Hawk and Wang (1999) identified a number of different Web searching strategies, for example, surveying, explor-ing, link following, back &amp; forward going, and engine searching. Their study demonstrated that in most cases, the searchers use several alternative strategies; this evidences the multifaceted nature of Web searching.

Most of the studies of Web searching are based on the analysis of assigned search tasks and they incor-porate quasi-experimental features as exemplified by Fidel et al. (1999), Hsieh-Yee (1998), Kim and Allen (2002) ,and White and Iivonen (2001, 2002) . There is also a number of Web searching studies based on log analysis (e.g., Spink, Ozmutlu, &amp; Lorence, 2004; Spink et al., 2001 ). In a study focusing on the general pub-lic using Alta Vista and Excite search engines Spink et al. (2001) found that the searches were short, not much modified and very simple in structure. In most cases, Web users appeared to view few result pages, and they tended not to browse beyond the first or second page results. They also easily modified their query statements, gave up the old ones and tried new ones. When they found nothing, they readily changed one word for another, or added or subtracted words ( Jansen, Spink, &amp; Saracevic, 2000 ). Finally, there are also a few studies focusing on fully self-generated tasks; these studies resemble naturalistic settings of Web search-ing. For example, Slone (2003) observed 31 public library users searching the Web and/or a Web-based on-line catalogue. The self-generated search tasks also included job-related topics. One of her findings was that people seeking information for job-related or educational purposes were more motivated than those seeking for recreational or personal purposes.

More generally: because a considerable part of Web searches conducted by the general public seem to serve non-work purposes such as recreation, the users may not be particularly motivated to plan their
Web searches carefully and to learn sophisticated methods based on the use of the Boolean operators ( Slone, 2002 ). Thus, search results tend to be evaluated with less demanding criteria than in job-related con-texts. The Web  X  s interactive nature may support users  X  belief that they do not need to plan searches before-information tracks every time they search, jettison resources they go and soon lose track of where they have come from ... people start from scratch every time they search. The new is exciting; discovery is the key information seeking driver X  X  ( Nicholas et al., 2004, p. 39 ).
 Since in most cases the Web searchers are satisfied with  X  X  X ood enough X  X  results, the depth and length of a
Web searching process is determined by various kinds of decision rules such as satisficing ( Agosto, 2002, pp. 23 X 25 ). As Shepherd, Watters, and Kaushik (2001, p. 258) point out, it is not uncommon that users only read the first part of a Web page and stop reading when it no longer fits within their framework. Users seem to make a decision to traverse a link to the next page only as long as the value of the current page exceeds some threshold. Characteristic of navigating on the Web is that it is quite strongly directed by the search system, because it primarily determines (or suggests) the search paths. The navigation process goes on step by step, instantly drawing on feedback received from previous search moves. Thus, Web searching seems to incorporate the features of  X  X  X errypicking X  X  as suggested by Bates (1979) . This means that a Web search is continually evolving, both with regard to the selection of search terms deemed appropriate and the conceptualization of the search plan. It is also possible to reach the goal by utilizing one of multiple routes. In some cases, useful information objects or documents may also be found by chance.

In sum, previous studies on Web searching provide a multifaceted picture of Web searching, and they identify a number of cognitive, affective and situational factors influencing the search processes. These stud-ies suggest that Web searching is a dynamic and context-bound activity based on the combined use of browsing links and using search engines. Web searching seems to be strongly guided by clues provided by the search environment. In most cases, the judgment of the relevance of information being found is based on the assessment of what is  X  X  X ood enough X  X , and various kinds of decision rules direct the search process. In these studies, however, insufficient attention is paid to the nature of problems that interrupt or halt search activities during search sessions. Similarly, attention is seldom paid to the ways in which searchers try to overcome discontinuities during search processes. 3. The empirical study 3.1. Theoretical framework
In order to deepen the empirical picture of the dynamic and context-sensitive nature of Web searching, we draw on the concepts of gap-facing and gap-bridging suggested by the Sense-Making theory ( Dervin, 1983, 1992, 1999 ). The main starting point of the Sense-Making theory is the assumption of discontinuity or  X  X  X appiness X  X  as a fundamental aspect of reality. Obviously, the assumption of discontinuity concerns all activities of information seeking, including Web searching. According to Dervin (1992) , discontinuity pre-sents a mandate for humans to construct sense in constantly changing life situations. Construction activity of this kind is called sense-making that can be pictured as building bridges across gaps. Dervin (1983, p. 17) employs the metaphorical concepts of situation , gap , and use to depict information seeking and use as a sense-making process. Situation stands for the time X  X pace context where the individual becomes aware of the insufficiency of his or her earlier definition of a situation. Gaps refer to questions or information needs elicited in situations of this kind. Uses stand for the ways in which information received from various sources helped one to create a new sense and to bridge a gap.

Interestingly, the above metaphors suggest that information searching can be approached as if it was physical action like step-taking on a rambling path. Having faced a gap, the individual has to stop in order to find a new route. We may speculate that the step-taker who stopped in front of the gap will first define its major qualities. This phase consists of gap-facing and gap-defining , followed by the consideration of gap-bridging strategies and tactics . As in real life, anticipation precedes action in gap-bridging; the anticipation may be based on earlier experiences of how different kinds of bridges have helped in continuing the journey ( Dervin, 1983, p. 17; Savolainen, 2000 ).
 The Sense-Making theory provides a sophisticated methodology to investigate these issues in detail.
More specifically, the theory provides analytical categories to study situation movement states (SMS) and gaps from the viewpoint of the searcher. SMS is a category scheme that focuses on how one sees him-or herself as stopped or moving at a particular moment of time ( Dervin &amp; Frenette, 2003, pp. 241 X 243 ).
SMS  X  s include, for example, Decision (the need to choose between two or more roads) and Barrier (not knowing where to go because something blocks the way) (cf. Kari, 2001, pp. 72 X 73 ). In turn, gaps may be defined by referring to specific questions presented in these kind of situations. Thus, SMS  X  s stand for contexts where such questions are elicited. In the Sense-Making theory, the questions indicating gaps have been traditionally divided into five types standing for the so-called 5W focus: How, What, When/where,
Who and Why ( Dervin, Jacobson, &amp; Nilan, 1982, p. 431 ). For example, What questions may concern the nature of factors stopping the movement, whereas How questions concentrate on the ways in which the movement may be continued.
The present study concentrates on the ways in which people choose and apply individual search tactics during the Web searching process, conceptualized from the viewpoint of gap-facing and gap-bridging. In other words, Web searching is understood as a dynamic process of gap-bridging triggered by gap-facing.
Search tactic 1 is perceived as a method that is used to continue searching, until  X  X  X ood enough X  X  search re-sults have been found. More specifically, we analyzed each individual step as a tactic (the search tactics will be discussed empirically in more detail below). In this context, articulations of gap-facing indicate the ways in which the search tactic used thus far is perceived as inadequate. In turn, articulations of gap-bridging indicate the ways in which searchers use alternative search tactics which were chosen in order to continue searching. The search process is illustrated in Fig. 1 .

Fig. 1 schematically describes judgments and actions constituting an individual step in Web searching between two gaps. Having faced Gap 1, the searcher perceives that his or her search tactic used thus far is no longer adequate in obtaining meaningful search results. As discussed in more detail in Section 4, the gaps may arise from a number of factors, for example, information overload or poorly organized
Web sites. The identification of alternative search tactics may be based on various sources, for example, earlier experiences in similar gap situations. Having compared the strengths and weaknesses of alternative tactics, the searcher decides on one alternative and rejects the others ( Fig. 1 is intentionally simplified in that it exemplifies only a few alternative tactics discussed in Section 4). Next, the chosen tactic will be ap-plied in practice in order to access Web pages. Sometimes, gap-bridging is interrupted by the fact that the selected hyperlinks cannot be activated, due to technical problems. This results in the encountering of a new
Gap (Gap 2a in Fig. 1 ). In a positive case, the searcher can access the intended Web page and thus, he or she may judge the relevance of the activated page. Positive assessments may motivate the person to continue searching by using the same tactic again; alternatively, other tactics may be considered, for example, to broaden the search to get more similar pages. If sufficient enough information has been found, the search may also be ended; in this case, the gap has been bridged and the search task has completed. However, if information that is found is judged irrelevant, the searcher experiences a new gap (Gap 2b in Fig. 1 ) due to non-technical reasons such as no relevant material available or inaccessible content of information. In this occasion, similar to Gaps 1 or 2a, the searcher has to devise a new plan in order to take the next steps, until the searching has yielded good enough results.

Since our study is exploratory, the search process outlined in Fig. 1 will be explored on a general level in order to get an overall picture of searching that proceeds between gaps. Thus, no detailed attention will be devoted, for example, to the criteria by which searchers judge the strengths and weaknesses of alternative search tactics. Similarly, the criteria used in relevance judgments will not be discussed in more detail (these issues will be explored in a separate study).

The hyperlinks providing access to Web pages stand for a myriad of potential search paths of varying length. As the searcher chooses one of the links, activates it and uses (that is, reads) a Web page thus opened, a step is taken. The consecutive steps X  X y whatever criteria chosen X  X orm the (actual) search path.
In terms of the Sense-Making theory, this path may also be called a bridge built across a gap. Said other-wise, the chosen search tactics resulting in individual search paths serve the ends of gap-bridging as the search evolves. Thus, the extent to which the searcher succeeds to bridge the gap depends on the selection of the search tactics and the ways which they have been used.

However, as illustrated in Section 4, it is not always easy to specify how many new Web pages need to be visited in order to reach  X  X  X ood enough X  X  answers, that is, to indicate when an individual gap has been bridged sufficiently and when the user may stop searching or redirect the search to new areas of interest.
It may also appear that every Web page visited does not necessarily serve the bridging of the  X  X  X riginal X  X  gap because new pages may discuss topics not directly associated with the factors which stopped the search.
Thus, it is not always easy to define which one of the Web pages visited finally helped the searcher  X  X  X ut of the gap X  X , and which of the steps are merely  X  X  X dditional X  X , that is, not directly related to the original gap, before the next gap is experienced. On the other hand, this is not fatal from the viewpoint of the Sense-
Making theory because it does not assume that all steps between gaps are immediately serving the needs to bridge gaps faced before. As Dervin (1992, p. 277) suggests, some parts of step-taking may be  X  X  X ree-flow-ing X  X ; they are not constrained by the need to bridge a specific gap. This may be manifested, for example, in casual surfing which results in the deviation from the original search path, and thus, navigation is some-times just a non-gappy movement forward. 3.2. The collection and analysis of empirical data
The empirical study is based on data gathered in 2001 X 2002 in Tampere, Finland. Altogether 18 infor-mants participated in the study. First, semi-structured interviews were conducted to examine the ways in which the informants use the Internet in information seeking. Second, they were asked to execute a Web search on a self-chosen topic related to personal development, for example, hobbies ( Kari &amp; Savolainen, 2003 ). Three informants executed their search at home or at workplace. The majority of the informants (15 persons) agreed to conduct their search on the premises of the Department of Information Studies, Uni-versity of Tampere. In contrast to the three searches conducted elsewhere, these searches were videotaped.
Wherever a Web session took place, the participant always had the liberty to select any available browser program s/he wished, and to carry out the search as s/he saw fit, on a subject of his/her own choice. There was no real time limit, either. The duration of the sessions fell somewhere between half an hour and two hours. The sole restriction was that the search topic had to concern personal development.

Sometimes, a participant looked for information on more than just one subject within a single Web ses-sion; the maximum was as many as seven topics. In a few other cases, the person searched the Web for the same thing on two separate occasions. A great majority of the informants felt that it would take more than three (some even spoke of dozens) rounds of Web searching to satisfy their then need for information (cf.
Fidel et al., 1999 ). For understandable reasons, it would have become impossible to document all of these instances, and therefore only one search session per person was usually deemed sufficient. Two sittings took place with three participants (separately), as this appeared more appropriate in their situations. When a participant came to the Web laboratory, the search session was captured on videotape. This was enabled by a computer-to-TV converter (AVerKey500), which had been inserted between the PC and its monitor.
A microphone was also attached to the video cassette recorder, which arrangement synchronized the events on the computer screen with the searcher  X  s speech. The video tapes came to hold a total of some seventeen hours of data ( Kari, 2004 ).

The present study focuses on the videotaped Web searches conducted by seven informants. The number of searchers was limited due to the exploratory nature of our study. On the other hand, the low number was justified by aspirations to in-depth qualitative analysis of the case searches, rather than gathering data for statistical analysis. In the selection of case searches, we preferred those containing richest, that is, most nuanced think aloud data with regard to the articulation of encountering problems (gap-facing) during the search process and ways of resolving them (gap-bridging). Characteristically, these searches did not sim-ply deal with the finding of individual facts from information sources that were familiar from earlier use.
Of the seven participants discussed in the present study, four were females and three males. The ages of the participants ranged from 22 to 70 years, averaging 38 years. The average age gives a slightly biased overall picture due to one retired person; the age of three youngest participants ranged between 22 and 25 years, whereas three persons were between 35 and 57 years of age. Four of the participants were univer-sity students. Two worked as an engineer and a computer specialist. One participant was a pensioner. Two informants had basic skills of Web searching while others were more experienced in this field.
Searches based on self-generated topics have both benefits and drawbacks, as compared to search tasks designed by the researchers. Apparently, self-generated topics enhance the naturalism and spontaneity of case searches which may not be attained in standardized experimental settings. This is important particularly in free-time contexts such as hobbies where the searches are probably less affected by tight time frames and the requirements of immediate success characteristic of job-related searching. On the other hand, freely self-generated topics may lead to considerable variation in the search topics, thus making it difficult to directly compare the search tactics and results. This may be due to the varying scope, complex-ity, depth and length of searches. Also in our study, the case searches varied in these respects. However, this variation did not ruin the empirical research setting because the main emphasis was laid on qualitative anal-ysis in which the primary interest was in the natural variation of situation-bound search tactics.
During the searches, the subjects visited altogether 932 Web pages (some pages were visited more than once). The highest number of pages visited by an individual searcher was 236 and the lowest 59 pages, respectively. Even though the collection of empirical data through thinking aloud necessarily interferes with the search process and increases the cognitive load of the searcher, attempts were made to organize the searching environment as comfortable as possible in order to emulate free-time Web searching. The main exception was that the users did not have access to bookmarks or other kinds of personal link lists serving limitations such as these affected their search processes.

Despite these limitations, we assume that the subjects X  X y means of the think aloud method X  X ere able to articulate clearly enough the ways in which they faced problems in their searches and resolved them as they moved in the Web. Further, they are assumed to have been able to articulate how they sometimes failed in these attempts and how they tried to continue searching. Because the searchers were not expected to be familiar with concepts such as gap-facing and gap-bridging, the researchers did not refer to them when instructing the participants how to think aloud. The instructions were more general: the searchers were asked to explain concurrently how they moved from one hyperlink or Web page to another and why they selected or rejected pages as they moved on in the Web. Because the searchers were not specifically asked to reflect on the search process as in a time-line interview indicating individual gaps and gap-bridging procedures ( Dervin, 1992 ), the processes of gap-facing and gap-bridging were reconstructed from the think aloud data. This was due to the fact that the present study utilizes the ideas of the Sense-Making theory on a general level in order to identify the major gaps faced in searching and to shed light on the discontinuous nature of Web searching. Since in most cases, the articulations referring to stopping and moving during the search processes were quite specific, the think aloud data enabled reconstructions which are sufficiently accurate for the purposes of the present study.

All empirical material was then transformed into computer-readable text. The data processing involved transcribing the audio recordings, as well as interpreting the taped video films. The video cassettes were played back and the participants navigational paths were manually logged, page by page ( Kari, 2004 ).
The analysis began with a careful reading of the transcriptions. Then, the specific parts where the users articulated situation movement states indicating blocked paths were identified
In order to enhance the reliability of our study, a sample of the gaps and search tactics was classified by the second author. The overlap between the researchers was 74%; it is within the acceptable level (0.67 X 0.80) recommended by Krippendorff for drawing tentative conclusions in exploratory qualitative studies ( Krip-pendorff, 1980, p. 147; cf. Wang &amp; Soergel, 1998, p. 120 ).

In the coding, specific attention was paid to the ways in which the searchers articulated their experiences of being stopped, that is, experiences elicited by facing a gap and their reflections of ways in which the movement may could continued, for example, by activating additional hyperlinks available on the screen.
The major characteristics of gaps were specified by the method of qualitative content analysis by inductively identifying and comparing the articulations of gap-facing, finally resulting in a classification of 11 major gaps. In the analysis, only the most significant gaps unquestionably stopping a free-flowing search were in-cluded. Thus, for example, slow access to search engines was not considered a major gap, because the search was not interrupted for this reason. However, if the search was stopped by announcements such as  X  X  X ccess denied X  X , these occasions were classified as gaps (see Section 4.1).

The analysis was continued by examining the methods which were used to bridge the gaps. More spe-cifically, gap-bridging was defined as (i) identifying a (alternative) search tactic by which the searcher be-lieved to be able to get out of the gap and to take the next step (for example, by abandoning an unfruitful search and typing a new search term in the search engine) and (ii) applying the chosen tactic in practice to continue searching (for example, de facto typing a new search word, executing a search com-mand, and evaluating the sufficiency of the search result from the viewpoint of the search task) (cf. Fig. 1 above). The search tactics used in gap-bridging will be characterized in detail in Section 4. 4. Empirical findings
The self-chosen topics of the case searches varied a lot, including  X  X  X ersonal portrait in digital media X  X ,  X  X  X irtual worlds X  X ,  X  X  X ystic places as paranormal phenomena X  X ,  X  X  X ar in Lapland in 1944 X 1945 X  X , and  X  X  X pace stations X  X . The empirical analysis revealed 11 diverse types of gap. 4.1. Quantitative overview Table 1 gives an overview of the frequency of gaps.

In most cases (55.6%), the searchers were stopped when no relevant material was found by activating links or using search engines such as Google. Other major gaps stand for general level confusion of how to take the next step, or inability to comprehend information available on Web pages. Less frequently, the searchers were stopped due to the problem of  X  X  X oo many hits X  X . The role of gaps such as forbidden access to a Web page or frozen engines remained relatively insignificant. However, in addition to two cases of technical problems mentioned in Table 1 , frozen engine was the main reason for completely stopping two case searches; having faced this gap, the searchers indicated that they were not willing to boot the computer and to start a new search. Table 2 specifies the search tactics used in gap-bridging.

Table 2 specifies the occurrences of 13 diverse search tactics that were used to bridge altogether 178 gaps identified in the study. On an average, each gap required about 3 or 4 tactics to resolve. As Table 2 indi-cates, of the individual tactics, Following links was used most frequently (altogether 315 times by various searchers), whereas Finding by chance took place only once (by one searcher). Similar to the gaps, the dis-tribution of search tactics was uneven since the most popular tactic, that is, following links was used almost in every second case (48% of all cases). Also going back (24%) and using a search engine (10%) were favored quite often. These three covered almost 83% of the repertoire of the search tactics. These findings are in line with the results of earlier studies 3 on Web searching tactics (see, for example, Catledge &amp; Pitkow, 1995;
Kari, 2004 ). Even though other tactics specified in Table 2 were used infrequently, they were not less sig-nificant in individual cases. Similar to the above distribution, following links (42.1%), going back (21.9%), finding search terms (16.9%) and using search engines (7.3%) appeared to be the most popular tactics when the searchers took the first step, that is, when they made their first search attempt. Quantitatively, the role of other tactics remained quite insignificant also in this respect.

The search tactics specified in Table 2 serve both analytical and browsing strategies of searching as de-fined by Bates (2002) and Marchionini (1995) . Of the tactics, only finding search terms, narrowing search and using search engine (altogether 18.3% of all tactics used) are clearly related to analytical search strat-egies. The rest (81.7%) more or less deal with browsing. This indicates the predominance of the browsing approach when people move in the Web.

We may substantiate the quantitative overview by having a look at the length of individual search paths during a search session. More specifically, the search path consists of consecutive pages which are activated after having faced a problematic page (or a  X  X  X ap page X  X ) that stopped the search and before encountering the next  X  X  X ap page X  X . In most cases, the paths remained very short. Altogether 163 individual search paths were identified. No less than 39% of all paths consisted of only one single step: facing a gap ! activating a hyperlink and reading the Web page opened ! facing a new gap. The share of paths with two steps was 20% and three steps 15%. Thus, about 75% of the search paths did not exceed 3 steps. The share of paths with 10 or more steps was about 8%. The longest path consisted of 20 steps. In this case, the searcher mainly surfed from one link to another or used the Back button.

We may now summarize the quantitative picture. Eleven types of gaps and 13 types of search tactics used in gap-bridging were identified. In both cases, a few categories dominate. The most frequent gaps faced in
Web searching were finding no relevant material, confusion about how to continue the search, difficulties in comprehending the information content and the problem of  X  X  X oo many hits X  X . In trying to bridge the gaps, the searchers most often followed links, activated Back button or used a search engine. Most search paths were very short. To simplify: the most frequent combination of gap-facing and gap-bridging was as follows: activating a Web page ! finding that the material provided by the page is not sufficiently relevant ! acti-vating a link on the screen. 4.2. Qualitative picture
Next, we continue with qualitative analysis by placing emphasis on the characteristics of search tactics used in gap-bridging. They are approached by taking the gaps as a starting point: what kinds of search tac-tics are used in the context of various gaps? We proceed by devoting attention to the ways in which the searchers explained the choice of the next steps.

The empirical analysis indicated that the nature of gaps faced by the searchers can be grouped into three major classes. First, there were gaps related to the problematic content of the information found. Of the gaps specified in Table 1 , Inaccessible content and No relevant material available could be located in this cate-gory. Altogether, 65.7% of all gaps faced were of this type. Secondly, there were gaps originating from insufficient search competence . The following gaps were included in this category: Confusion, Crossroads,
No links, No search terms, Overload, and Wrong way. Of all gaps, 26.9% were classified in this group. Fi-nally, there were gaps caused by the search environment (7.3% of all gaps). Gaps of this type included Badly organized material, No access, and Technical problems.

The above classification is not mutually exclusive, since some of the gap types overlap partly. For exam-ple, Confusion and Crossroads may stem X  X t least partly X  X rom the problematic nature of information content, not from insufficient search competence only. However, these gaps could be differentiated suffi-ciently well in the empirical analysis since Confusion refers to ambiguous situations where the searcher is in general unable to see how to continue searching. Usually, Crossroads stands for an easier decision sit-uation, because the searcher has to choose between two or more links already available.

On the other hand, we may assume that encountering hyperlinks giving access to irrelevant Web pages is X  X t least partly X  X ue to one  X  s inability to select adequate search terms and specify the query. Because the present study is not interested in the causal relationships between gaps and gap-bridging processes, we draw on the above descriptive grouping of the gap types; the following analysis is structured according to this classification. Due to space restrictions, only one gap type of each class is taken into further analysis.
Our aim is to illustrate the relationships between various kinds of gaps and search tactics; a detailed qual-itative analysis of all 11 gap types would have required a separate study. The gap types discussed below are No relevant material available, Confusion and Technical problems. No relevant material available and
Confusion were most frequent within the main groups of gaps specified above. In addition, both of them exemplify major content problems characteristic of Web searching. Even though Technical problems was not most frequent within the third main group of gaps, it significantly exemplifies many of the problems originating from the search system, and hence, it is worth qualitative analysis.
 4.2.1. Bridging gaps related to problematic information content. The case of No relevant material available
As noted above, finding no relevant material was the most common gap faced in Web searching. Most frequently, the searchers tried to bridge this gap by following links or activating the Back button. The informants also made efforts to bridge this gap by using search engines or typing a URL they knew from earlier use. Most frequently, the first step was taken by following a link. After that, the searchers used the
Back button, conducted searches and tried other methods in a varying order. The search paths tended to be very short: 38% of all paths contained only one step, and 34% two or three steps.

The following excerpt illustrates the way in which one of the searchers faced the gap of No relevant information available and how she tried to bridge the gap. Her current search task was to find material about personal portrait in digital media.

Page 2 [University of Arts and Design Helsinki]  X  X  X  will see the links there. X  X  Following links
Page 3 [University of Arts and Design Helsinki]  X  X  X here is a Lume [ X  X  X elusion X  X  X  link here, this is good, the institute have linked them ... but this is about movies only. I have no time to play with them, let  X  s try next a Google search. X  X  Moving to known resource
Page 4 [Google search engine]  X  X  X   X  m used to use it more than earlier because in my view it [Google] finds quite well different kind of links, but not always so. Also here is something like in the previous search, but I will try the same query also here. X  X 
Finding search terms ! Using search engine [Google; search terms: henkilo  X  kuva, digitaalinen media/por-trait, digital media]
Page 5 [Google search engine]  X  X  X ops, that was not a particularly good query. X  X  Gap : No links.

The search was stopped by a  X  X  X ap page X  X  (page 1) providing irrelevant information about movies pro-duction. During the first step, her main interest lies in the usefulness of the information content of the next hyperlinks, as compared to the  X  X  X ap page X  X . The central X  X ven though implicit X  X uestion posed at that moment of gap-facing is whether alternative hyperlinks would be able to provide access to more relevant pages? As in the above case, several alternative methods are often available to access these pages, for exam-ple, following links or executing a search. The choice between following links and using a search engine may depend on how well the individual is aware of the potentials of different search engines such as Google. In the above case, the searcher draws on analogous search cases where the same tactic worked sufficiently well.
An interesting figure of speech which was repeated also in other searchers  X  articulations is  X  X  X et  X  s try this next X  X . Expressions such as these indicate a strong future orientation in gap-bridging. More generally, arti-gap-bridging. As exemplified by the experiences of consulting page 5, an ubiquitous problem is that alter-native links or pages do not necessarily guarantee success. Often, the  X  X  X romise of use value X  X  suggested by the title of the link appears to be false, leading to recurrent disappointments. However, in order to proceed, the Web searcher has to recover rapidly, and he or she should be ready to try the next links because the Web seems to provide new  X  X  X econd chances X  X , almost endlessly.

In the case of longer search paths, the prevalence of the most frequent methods of gap-bridging, that is, following links and using the Back button tended to increase. There were cases where the searcher moved on by clicking the links quite mechanistically. Quite often, the searchers heuristically moved back and forth to specify the search results. The subject started with a vague perception of the potential value of the next page and assessed its relevance in relation to his or her information need. It also appeared that the bridging of the  X  X  X riginal X  X  gap was not necessarily the major motive in trying the next step when the search path became longer. The longer the path, the more probable that new elements not directly related to the original gap appeared. Overall, in the cases of long paths primarily based on following links, Web searching was strongly affected by the clues provided by the search environment.

In some searches aiming at bridging the No relevant material gaps, the searcher managed to take the next step by making use of  X  X  X andmarks X  X , that is, visiting pages which were known from earlier use. This strategy appeared to be particularly useful when there were no other clues of how to proceed. As noted above, the problem of missing landmarks was aggravated by the fact that the searchers did not have per-sonal bookmarks at their disposal.

In the following excerpt, the subject searches information about mystic places. Having faced a  X  X  X ap page X  X , he attempted to bridge the gap by identifying hyperlink lists that would rapidly lead to the most relevant Web pages discussing this topic.

Page 1 [Ihmemaa/ a Finnish search engine]  X  X  X mmm, the travel resource pages of Aki Peltonen. I cannot see from the general level information that these pages are relevant, as far as mystic places are concerned. X  X  Gap : No relevant material Following links
Page 2 [Ihmemaa/ a Finnish search engine]  X  X  X ou just have to try what is this. It pays to try because there may be good links ahead. Here we have them but these are not about my issue. X  X  Following links

Page 4 [Ihmemaa/ a Finnish search engine]  X  X  X  may specify this by taking  X  mystic historical  X  and  X  cultural places Finland. There will be five specifying factors, so the number may become smaller, perhaps even too small? Here we go. X  X  Narrowing search ! Using search engine : [Ihmemaa/ a Finnish search engine]
Page 5 [Ihmemaa/ a Finnish search engine]  X  X  X ell, this time we got less than one thousand pages, but anyway, will this lead us to anything? X  X  Gap : Overload.

Access to a qualified link list or directory is often an effective method to avoid the laborious alternative of trying and rejecting pages, one after another. The problem of the missing link list culminates in the above excerpt. Getting tired of the method of  X  X  X rial and error X  X , the same subject called out in a later phase of his search:  X  X  X t seems that I have to make the links by myself because nobody has been able to do that or has been interested in this X  X . Certain material about topics such as  X  X  X irtual Finland X  X  was immediately rejected in this context because the expected use value of these pages was seen to be low. Importantly, these expressions functioned as decision rules which helped the participant discard the less promising alternatives in order to focus on the pages suggesting higher amount of use value. In the evaluation of the Web pages, the searcher drew on a kind of  X  X  X ogic of exclusion X  X  in that he first identified material which is not relevant and sorts these Web pages out. It is evident that this evaluation was based on quick and rather impressionistic assessments.
More generally, the excerpt illustrates the fact that Web searchers seldom take time to evaluate the informa-tion content in more detail if the title of the link signals stop words such as  X  X  X irtual Finland X  X .
Depending on their search experience, the individuals could have access to other Web sites that were potentially useful. Often, even coarse level memories of some kinds of landmarks such as university depart-ments may be useful. The broader the repertoire of analogous use experiences in prior search situations with similar search topics, the easier it is to continue movement by expecting that sooner or later, the search will zero in on more relevant materials.

In the above case, one of the  X  X  X andmarks X  X  of this type was the homepage of a magazine. However, even these resources do not always guarantee success, because the material available through link lists may be too general for the purposes of the search task at hand. There is a third alternative: unspecific link lists may be compensated for X  X t least partly X  X y focused searches. Even though the queries were formulated carefully, the searcher faced a common problem in Web searching: too many hits to be assessed. It seems that the attempts of gap-bridging often take place close to the end points of a continuum: either there is too much potentially relevant material to be ploughed through, or no relevant pages are available. However, in most cases, the material found is not totally useless and thus, the gap can be bridged, at least partially. In this context, the most important question concerns the subjective assessment of what amount of material is  X  X  X n-ough X  X  and what kind of material is  X  X  X ufficiently good X  X  to bridge the gap of No relevant material available. 4.2.2. Bridging gaps related to insufficient search competence. The case of Confusion
Confusion is one of the gaps originating from insufficient search competence. More specifically, gaps of this type are caused by inadequate domain knowledge and lacking skills in specifying search terms and strategies (cf. Savolainen, 2002 ). The lack of appropriate search terms often stems from the fact that the searcher has not clarified the search topic or information need at the conceptual level. Thus, he or she is unable to assess how well the search term candidates correspond to the concepts indicating his or her infor-mation needs. Usually, the only way out seems to be heuristic: relevant material could be recognised if it is available on the screen. The sufficiency of domain and search knowledge is always dependent on the requirements of the search task and the features of the situation where the search process takes place. Thus, for example, following links may be an efficient tactic in specific situations where there is a need to get a quick overview of an issue, but the same method may be wanting in trying to find a specific fact.
The following example characterizes the nature of Confusion as one of the major gaps. The above sub-ject continues his search about mystic places:
Page 1 [Mystic places]  X  X  X  will take this one from History ... is this the previous one or not? No, where were we? This is ... where is that search? ... what if I go back to the search? X  X  Gap : Confusion Following links
Page 2 [Ihmemaa/ a Finnish search engine]  X  X  X s this the search where I was? Hopefully ... well ... I guess the last one may give the result I hope. X  X 
Finding search terms/ Using a search engine : [Ihmemaa/ a Finnish Search engine. Search terms: mystic places AND Finland]
Page 3 [Ihmemaa/ a Finnish search engine]  X  X  X es, but anyway, let  X  s try the History page again to get out of this  X  X  X arrier page X  X  because nothing else helped, let  X  s go back. X  X  Going back
Page 4 [Mystic places]  X  X  X hould I do the same again? It would not be a hard job, but again, nothing, here we are, in the starting point even if a little bit more wiser because you know that it is no use to visit those pages ... sooner, I would drink poison than go there again. You seldom find pages which do not allow you to get out. Usu-ally, at least going back is allowed. X  X  Using a search engine : [Ihmemaa/ a Finnish Search engine]
Page 5 [Ihmemaa/ a Finnish Search engine]  X  X  ... mmm, impossible to say whether these links discuss mystical places in some countries or regions. I would like to include the whole world in my searches. X  X  Gap : Confusion.

Characteristic of gaps originating from insufficient search competence, the searcher faced several prob-lems at the same time. First, he is unaware of how to use the search system X  X ore specifically X  X ow to get back to previous pages which were perceived as particularly relevant because the pages found later ap-peared to be of low value. Second, due to technical problems, he was  X  X  X tuck X  X  on a page which has no way out. Luckily, he recalled that the History file may provide help. However, the gap has not been bridged because there were no efficient search tactics available. The only way out appeared to be guesswork, that is, trying some promising search words that would provide additional clues.

More generally, in situations of Confusion, the searchers tended to return to Web pages which were familiar from earlier use. In this way, they tried to regain control of the ongoing search process. Similar attempts were favored in trying to bridge other types of gap (for example, Information overload) stemming from insufficient search competence. Occasionally in the above case, an attempt to bridge a gap failed be-cause the search terms were unspecific, and the searcher remained unaware of how to go beyond mere guesswork. On the other hand, heurististic strategies may be fairly effective if the hyperlinks found by chance provide at least one relevant starting point. 4.2.3. Bridging gaps originating from the search environment. The case of Technical problems (TeP)
Technical problems such as a computer crash effectively stop one  X  s movement in the Web. These prob-lems appeared to be rare, since only two gaps of this type were identified. Often, technical problems only tend to be indirectly related to the search topic. However, in the following case, the technical problem was partly  X  X  X aused X  X  by the search task, because the searcher interested in space stations wanted to access video clips relevant to her topic.

Page 1 [Windows media Player]  X  X  X nable to download ... decompressor. It seems to try to download a decoding program so that it can presented it here, but it seems that we cannot proceed this way, even though we would spend the whole night here. So, what to look at next because we did not succeed in watching movies? X  X  Gap : Technical problem Going back
Page 2 [Apollo Lunar Surface Journal]  X  X  X  get out of the picture page, let  X  s see this. X  X  Following links
Page 3 [Apollo Lunar Surface Journal]  X  X  X his goes so slowly. But I think I will go back to the main page of NASA, if I could go somewhere through it. X  X  Following links
Page 4 [Apollo Lunar Surface Journal]  X  X  X erhaps it did not have time to go there, this is so slow. May I go better this way? X  X  Going back
Page 5 [Apollo Lunar Surface Journal]  X  X  X e started that way but how to go back to the page where we started to search these things. Let  X  sgo there and start anew. X  X  Following links
Page 6: [Makupalat/ a Finnish directory of links]  X  X  X t seems that this search engine is somehow frozen, not moving in any direction. Very nice indeed! It is so easy to get the machine frozen this way when searching something. Let  X  s see, if we were able to go somewhere else in an easier way. X  X  Following links
Page 7 [Makupalat/ a Finnish directory of links]  X  X  X hould there be something on the pages of Ursa 4 ? X  X  Following links
Page 8 [Astronomical database  X  X  X osmos X  X  X   X  X  X hese things are of special interest to me. Here are similar issues that we talk about at the work place when using computers slowing down ... when waiting, you may have time to knit a sock or something like that ... only waiting here, this is really slow. X  X  Gap : Technical problems.

The seriousness of technical problems may vary in Web searching. Sometimes they slow down the search process but do not stop it totally. Sometimes the whole search has to be abandoned or interrupted. In the above case, the  X  X  X rozen machine X  X  compelled the searcher to change her search plan because video clips could not be shown due to the limited capacity of the computer. Earlier search experiences appeared to be valuable, since the searcher was able to identify relevant sites (for example, NASA). However, the search was not completed, due to a recurrent technical problem. Thus, gaps are not necessarily related to one  X  s searching skills, but the search tools often posit significant limitations and restrict the utilization of the whole repertoire of one  X  s gap-bridging tactics. 5. Discussion and conclusions
The study indicated that the Sense-Making theory provides relevant conceptual tools to approach the dynamic and discontinuous nature of Web searching in terms of gap-facing and gap-bridging. The concept of gap-facing appeared to be useful since it enables a context-sensitive analysis of the ways in which Web search processes may be stopped. Gap-bridging is a less specific category in that indicates the general level motive to find alternative ways to continue searching.

The empirical findings suggest that the process of Web searching is strongly dependent on situational factors such as the repertoire of the links available on the screen; thus, any attempts to define  X  X  X  general logic X  X  of Web searching with regard to various types of gaps seem to be doomed to failure. The task is fur-ther aggravated by the fact that longer Web search processes may contain a considerable number of various gaps and efforts of gap-bridging. Obviously, moving in the Web is hard to predict and as a whole, search processes may be characterized as  X  X  X rotean X  X . In this respect, our study confirms earlier findings on the complex and highly dynamic characteristics of Web searching as evidenced, for example, by Pharo and Ja  X  rvelin (2004) and Wang et al. (2000) .

However, the qualitative analysis revealed certain features that seem to be common to most gap-bridging processes in Web searching. Firstly, at the general level, the nature of the gap oriented the ways in which the searchers attempted to take the first steps to bridge the gap. In most cases, the search was stopped due to the problematic nature of information found, that is, encountering irrelevant information or not being able to comprehend the information content. It was characteristic of the attempts to bridge gaps of this type that when choosing search tactics, emphasis was laid on the redirection of the search with the aim of identifying new links that provide access to more focused information in order to complete the search task. To simplify, bridging gaps of this type aims at finding links and pages that provide more focused information content. Thus, these gaps indicate an insufficient focus of the information content.
Successful processes of gap-bridging based on the use of well-chosen search tactics  X  X  X orrect X  X  this inadequacy.

When, however, searching was stopped by insufficient search competence, the searchers tended to return to the use of familiar Web material, for example  X  X  X andmarks X  X  such as home pages, in order to regain con-trol of the search process. Alternatively, they tried to specify the search terms in order to get a more focused set of results to be assessed in more detail. Ultimately, this gap-bridging aims at ends similar to the case of gaps originating from problematic information content. Finally, when the search was stopped by technical problems or other factors originating from the search system, the search tactics were motivated by  X  X  X ech-nically X  X  returning the search process back to the  X  X  X ight track X  X , that is, by identifying tools such as active links which enable one to move on. Usually, however, the factors giving rise to the gaps were intertwined.
For example, finding irrelevant information might be due to both lacking search competence and the fact that specific information particularly needed by the searcher was actually not available in the Web.
Secondly, the study revealed that as a search environment, the WWW almost endlessly affords  X  X  X econd chances X  X  to the searchers. Even though the search terms were not defined exactly, in most cases the search-ers found something that helped them take the next step. The frequently used heuristic of  X  X  X et  X  s try this next X  X  indicates that the Web searchers were well aware of this potential. On the other hand, a kind of  X  X  X ogic of exclusion X  X  by first rejecting the most irrelevant links appeared to be popular. Thirdly, the study indicated that typically, the searchers were able to move only a few steps before facing a new gap compelling them to change their direction. In most cases, the Web search process consisted of several short-lived and stop-go like episodes of trying various alternatives, one after another.

Further research is needed to explore in more detail the qualitative features of moving in the Web by utilizing the concepts of gap-facing and gap-bridging. There is a need for qualitative  X  X  X ath analysis X  X  that devotes attention to the ways in which individuals make sense of Web searching in the various phases of the step-taking process. The results of studies such as this would shed more light on the complex and dynamic nature of Web searching, and provide opportunities to compare findings which are obtained by drawing on alternative models of information searching.
