In the past decade there has been intensive work on annotation in different fields. For example, in the field of natural language processing (NLP) there has been much work in automatic named entity recognizers, lexical semantic labelers and disambiguators, dependency parsers and role labelers. These provide the possibility of a new level of representation for textual data beyond the bag-of-words representations that prevail today. Furthermore, they provide us with a new data (entities, relations, etc.) which may lead to completely novel tasks going beyond search.

Similarly, in a wide range of other fields such as Databases, Expert Systems, Library Sciences and Information Retrieval, and domains such as Law, Medicine and Design, there has always been a tradition of research dealing with knowledge rep-resentation (e.g. in the form of domain ontologies, thesaurus, frames, etc.). Although the original motivation of this work was to be able to do inference (deducing new facts or consequences from the data), in recent years there has been a growing interest in using this knowledge to improve closed-domain search engines. The most recent and extreme example of this is the Semantic Web movement, which proposes to represent some of the knowledge locked in web pages using simple for-mal semantics, enabling better web search and a new generation of web applications.

Despite the potential benefits of annotations for search, a few years ago there were very few academic publications where annotations were used specifically for search. 1 This is the case for several reasons. Perhaps the main reason is that making a successful use of annotations in search is a hard and mostly unsolved problem. But there are others. Another important rea-son, in our opinion, is that the work being carried out in this area is hard to publish (i.e. hard to be accepted by reviewers) in academic research conferences and journals. The reason for this is that good annotations are typically obtained only in small closed domains; but this (small size, and domain specificity) makes the work very specific and not easily generalizable. Furthermore it is expensive to develop evaluation sets in such domains because domain experts are needed. Finally, it is often the case that annotations are not used to directly improve the ranking, but rather, it is used to change the task, or the interaction mode; evaluating this requires user interaction studies which again are expensive and difficult. For these reasons it takes some imagination (and maybe faith) sometimes to appreciate the general interest of work carried out on a small domain, with a small set of annotators and evaluators.
 This state of affairs motivated the organization of the ESAIR workshops at ECIR X 08 and WSDM X 09 respectively ( Alonso &amp; Zaragoza, 2008 ), that were intended to provide a meeting place for researchers from different fields interested in the uses of annotations for search. The workshops were well attended with researchers from a wide range of backgrounds (from disci-plines such as NLP, Databases, Information Retrieval, and Machine Learning, working on domains from political science to design, law and astronomy), but despite the heterogeneity of the attendees it was stressed in the panels discussions they all shared a core set of common problems and that solutions from one field were easily applicable to the others.
These workshops in turn motivated the creation of this special issue, where we collected the best papers from the previous ESAIR workshops and we extended the call for papers to other researchers who had not been able to attend the workshop but were nevertheless working in this area. We received 30 submissions and we accepted 8. We selected carefully the program committee to contain people both from academy and industry who had had experience with annotated textual data and understood well the challenges, caveats and potential benefits. As we expected, many reviews came back asking for major re-writes and additions to the papers, and the authors of these papers worked hard to either please the reviewers or explain why this was not possible.

 Special Issue Reviewers We would like to thank IPM editor-in-Chief Fabio Crestani for his support and encouragement during the review process. We also thank the staff at Elsevier for helping us in the final preparation of this issue.
 We hope that readers who are interested in looking at the usage of annotations in different domain and applications will find something of interest in this issue. Finally, the 3rd ESAIR workshop will be part of the CKIM X 10 conference so we expect exciting research in this area.
