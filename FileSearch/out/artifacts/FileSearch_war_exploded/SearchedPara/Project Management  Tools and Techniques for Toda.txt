 Project Management: Tools and Techniques for Today X  X  LIS Professional, Barbara Allan. Neal-Schuman Publishers, New York (2004). Published by FACET  X  imprint of the Chartered Institute of Library and
Information Professionals, $75.00
Contents of this book include: context of library and information projects; project manager; project worker; project life cycle; money side of projects; people side of projects; working with diverse project teams; management of change; disseminating good practice; using ICT to support the project; and legal issues. Then, what is project management (PM) and how seriously are information professionals treating PM? Answers to these questions come in the book by Barbara Allen.

Exclusively orientated towards European Library practices, apart, Professor Allen gets the credit of writing a book in an area that is less traveled by the global community of Library and Information Science (LIS/ILS, to be read as Information and Library Service). Moreover, PM is not included in many North American LIS training programs nor does the job market look for people with education in PM. For instance, a PM job in library (Project Management Assistant) does not require any training/qualification in PM. Such a scenario may be viewed as an irony, despite the fact that PM profession has a high level of corporate acceptability and recognized certification programs. Questions such as, what are the reasons for this level of unconcerned-ness among the LIS, and why PM as an area of interest among the LIS professionals is, mysteriously, less traveled, etc. calls for extensive research.

While PM moves under the banner of systems approach, it in fact borrows its strengths from different fields including system analysis, management information systems, and information research management, in order to facilitate planning, organizing and controlling certain activities that require to confirm and comply budget and time constraints. In short,  X  X  X roject management involves using a range of management skills and tech-niques to successfully carry out a project (p. 9). X  X 
For an understanding of the concept and precursors, let us look further into specifics of PM. In order to manage a project, LIS professionals have to look for basic features of PM: (a) concepts and cases that relate to feasibility or pilot study; (b) what is a winning proposal and how to write one; (c) illustrations of bids and specifications; (d) examples of request for proposals; and (e) over and above all, templates and styles for doc-umentation. Before we forget, it is apt to remind ourselves that LIS professionals are supposed to be key role players in developing documentation. Here, the type of documentation that is required for PM is of three basic types, viz., first, documentation about the project as a proposal, second, documentation as a record of deci-sions and a means of recording assumptions on which such decisions were made or not made, and third, doc-umentation of the final transactions/end of the deal and post-project decisions. Such documentation is an important resource in enabling capture of tacit, tangible and intangible information that makes the project value-added, lasting for posterity and most importantly, acts as a supporting resource that facilitates avoiding serious disasters/mistakes in future Project Management. For content, context and strategies in systems par-adigm, all that is mentioned above, this book is not the source of information. Instead, for a book that high-lights importance of documentation in PM, one has to look elsewhere (Rakos et al., 2004).

The book, under review, has many recent citations, with an almost 99% bias toward British/European sources. But conspicuously absent are the following titles: (a) Project Management for Library and Informa-tion Service Professionals (Aslib Know How Guides) by Kirsten Black, Sylvia P. Webb (Editor), Europa Pub-lications (1996); (b) Guide to Information in Engineering Project Management: An Information and Library
Service Guide, Professional Engineering Publishing (1996); (c) Disaster management in British libraries: Pro-ject report with guidelines for library managers (Library and information research report) by Graham Mat-thews (British Library, 1996); and (d) The Hospital Information Project: A research project undertaken by
Kingston upon Hull City Libraries on behalf of Hull (A) Group Hospital Management ... ice from the College of Librarianship, Wales, by Graham L. Matthews (Hull (A) Group Hospital Management Committee; Kings-ton upon Hull City Libraries 1973).

Nevertheless, it is an excellent book that incorporates a number of examples and case studies. It religiously outlines the steps involved in PM, from planning to execution. The frame of reference, conceptual approach and strategy are valuable for LIS profession. It is a handy and easy to read textbook. Project Management is reader friendly too, because it comes from the pen of an experienced scholar, instructor as well practitioner. Prof. Barbara X  X  work is highly valuable for the programs offered in UK and elsewhere on PM.

Several university libraries during the early 1990s, in efforts to reduce costs, increase efficiency and produc-tivity, boost job satisfaction, empower and develop staff, and ultimately improve services, began a process of work reorganization. Noting the success of the team concept in the business world, some libraries adopted the selective use of teams in one or two work units while others moved towards a totally team based organization.
Working in teams is currently a widespread management technique and varying types of work teams in today X  X  libraries include multi-functional teams, project teams and cross functional teams. Another type of work team is the self-directed team. Also known as self-managed work teams, self-maintaining teams, self-leading teams, and self-regulating work teams, self-directed teams in the main, consist of a group of
