 Blogs facilitate online debates and discussions for millions of people around the world. Identifying the most popular and prevailing topics discussed in the Blogosphere is a cru-cial task. This poster describes our novel approach to the quantification of the level of topic propagation in the Blo-gosphere. Our model uses graph-theoretic representations of the Blogosphere X  X  link structures that allows it to de-duce the  X  X ercolation Threshold X , which is then used in the quantification and definition of a global topic. The result of our experiments on a blog collection shows that our model is able to quantify the propagation of topics. Moreover, our model is successful in identifying specific topics that propagate throughout the Blogosphere and classifies them as  X  X lobal X .

Despite a surge in the popularity of online social network-ing and creation of user-generated content on the Web, the industry has not been able to effectively harness the power of social networks due to the fact that the role and effect of so-cial media are not well studied and understood [3]. What is required are models that study and model the social dimen-sion in such networks. This poster presents  X  X ugarCube X , a model designed to tackle part of this problem by offering a mathematically precise solution for the quantification of the level of topic propagation. Not only can SugarCube quantify the proliferation level of topics, but it also identifies  X  X eav-ily propagated X  or global topics . SugarCube is inspired by Percolation Theory and its application in Physics [2].
SugarCube focuses on hyperlink analysis. Following the same separation of hyperlink layers as in [4], SugarCube dif-ferentiates between friendship links and blog entry links and utilises the combination of the following three relationship structures represented in graph-theoretic form: Blogroll Links (BL): also known as friendship or reader-ship graph, is a graph G BL ( V,E ) where vertices are blogs (bloggers), and edges are blogroll or friendship links. G represents the social network structure of bloggers, provides valuable insight into each blogger X  X  position within the blog-ging community, and reveals their likely source of influence and information. The spread of information within the so-cial network depends on the connectedness amongst bloggers which is reflected in the structure of the BL graph. Entry Links (EL): is a graph G EL ( V,E ) comprising of blog entries (represented by permalinks). EL edges are usu-ally formed by means of direct linking, commenting and trackbacks. EL graph is represented on a 2-dimensional plane called Blog-Time in which X-axis is Time ( T ), Y-axis consists of Blogs ( B ) in an arbitrary order, and each perma-link is a vertex v ( B,T ) where v  X  V in the graph G EL , de-noting the blog and time of the entry. Figure 2 schematically shows a G EL and a number of weakly connected components (WCC) in Blog-Time. SugarCube intuitively assumes that all the vertices in a particular WCC are discussing the same topic: that X  X  why they linked to each other.
 Percolation Graph (PG): Inspired by the Rumour Prop-agation model of A. L. Efros in [2], we adopt a lattice-based Percolation graph in order to transform the propa-gation problem into a Percolation Theory problem. The lattice chosen for this purpose is a Bethe lattice[1] for three main reasons: percolation in the Bethe lattice starts from its  X  X oot X  outwards, resembling the spread of information from one person to the wider social network. Also, the Bethe lat-tice has a configurable structure, its co-ordination number z (number of immediate neighbours of a vertex) can be set. Moreover, due to its distinctive topological structure, the statistical properties of the Bethe lattice are exactly solv-able. A simple Bethe lattice is shown in Figure 1.
In SugarCube, the value of z in PG is approximated to the average in-degree (  X   X  ) of vertices in G BL which indi-cates the average number of readership for a blogger. Ver-tices in the lattice represent blogs. Propagation of topics is designated as a bond percolation problem in which bonds symbolise the spread of topic awareness from one person to acquaintances within G BL with probability p . The Percola-tion Threshold ( P c ) for the Bethe lattice is precisely com-Table 1: Average BL in-degree  X   X  , PG coordina-tion number z and Percolation Threshold P c for the whole BL graph and its three top subgraphs putable: P c = 1 / ( z  X  1). This indicates that if the prob-ability p of bond connectivity between vertices (bloggers) exceeds P c , then information will percolate throughout the entire lattice. In other words, P c denotes a tipping point for the propagation of a topic, and in p &gt; P c , that topic is said to have heavily percolated through the community of bloggers, and thus is considered to be a  X  X lobal topic X . In SugarCube, p i is the fraction of blogs associated with a weakly connected component i in G EL .

EL formed around topics.
We tested SugarCube on the Blog06 collection [5]. A to-tal of 45,995 blogs were identified by their homepage URL. Analysis of G BL revealed a very large weakly connected sub-graph S 1 consisting of 23,469 blogs, followed by two smaller weakly connected components S 2 and S 3 each consisting of 87 and 34 blogs respectively. The rest of the subgraphs con-sist of very few vertices, therefore we focus on the top three. Table 1 lists the features of G BL and its top three weakly connected components.

With this setup, we applied SugarCube to two different subsets of the collection. We analysed G EL and computed the percolation fraction p i of blogs associated with each Figure 3: Growth of propagation for the top three percolating topics in both test scenarios.
 WCC i on S 1 , S 2 and S 3 and the whole of the G BL . In both settings, we identified a heavily propagated  X  X lobal X  topic, as well as several less-propagated ones. Figure 3 illustrates the number of blogs involved in the top three topics in the collection based on their propagation level. The growth of the larger group from sub-global to global state is clearly visible in both tests.
We analysed the Blog06 collection using SugarCube. Our experiment showed that SugarCube is successful in provid-ing a method for quantifying the propagation of topics, and also in identifying heavily percolated ones within the test collection. SugarCube showed how some topics grow in terms of popularity from being popular to becoming  X  X lobal X . To our knowledge, this is the first application of Percolation Theory in the quantification of propagation in Information Retrieval.
The next step is to evaluate the results in order to estab-lish the usefulness of SugarCube X  X  quantification method. One way to accomplish this task is to study the correlation between the percolation level of various topics (especially global ones), and observable trends in the Blogosphere ob-tained using other established and widely accepted methods.
