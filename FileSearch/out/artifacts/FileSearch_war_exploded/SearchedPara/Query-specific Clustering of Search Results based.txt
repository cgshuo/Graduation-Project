 This paper presents a pilot study of query-specific clustering that uses our novel document-context based similarity scores as compared with document similarity scores. Clustering is applied to the top 1000 retrieved documents for a given query. Clustering effectiveness is evaluated based on the MK1 score for TREC-2, TREC-6 and TREC-7 test collections. Encouraging results were obtained whereby document-context clustering produces better MK1 scores than document clus tering with a 95% confidence level if precision and recall are equally important.

[ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Clustering General Terms: Performance, Experimentation Keywords Document clustering, context-ba sed model, experimentations Previous work [1] has examined query-specific clustering of retrieved documents using document similarity scores and found that query-specific clustering was more effective than static clustering. Here, we look at the feasibility of using novel document-context similarity scores rather than document similarity scores in query-sp ecific clustering. Our document-contexts are text windows centered at the occurrences of query terms in a document. Apart fro m the introduction of document-contexts, our method is different from previous work on document clustering that computes subdocument similarity scores [2] because of our query-specific focus. We used the TREC-2, -6 and -7 ad hoc test collections with 50 title queries each. We clustered the top 1000 retrieved documents of our search engine that used the BM11 term weights [3] with pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF). Using PRF, more relevant documents are found in the top 1000 retrieved documents on average compared with an initial retrieval without PRF. We used group-average clustering because it performed well before [1]. Our document similarities are the cosine measures: where D and E are documents, v ( D ) is the document vector for D , is a vector of term weights ba sed on the modified BM11 formula: where t is a term, f ( t , D ) is the occurrence frequency of t in D , N is the total number of documents in the collection, df ( t ) is the document frequency of term t and  X  is the average Euclidean document length. We take the square root of the logarithmic term because this term is multiplie d with itself in the cosine calculation. Clustering using the square root of the logarithmic term produced better results than using the original logarithmic term, in our evaluation of the logarithmic term raised to different powers. The detail is not reported here due to the page limit. Figure 1 shows the frequency distribu tion of the similarity scores between all the relevant (RR) document pairs and between the relevant and non-relevant (RNR) document pairs for query 313 in TREC-6. Such similarity distribu tions of retrieved documents are not rare. The similarity scores of the RR pairs and RNR pairs are similar, suggesting that it is diffi cult to distinguish the relevant documents from the non-relevant ones by document clustering for some queries. Such similarity distributions are different from those expected in static clustering [4]. This is because the retrieval list contains many non-relevant docum ents that have query terms. Wu et al. [5] advocated a document-context based probabilistic retrieval model where scores are obtained using document-contexts centered on query term s. We develop our document-context similarity as follows. Let c ( q , D , m ) be the context of the query term q that occurs at location m in document D . Let the context similarity C ( q , D , m , E , n ) between two contexts at location m and n in document D and E respectively, be: m ). The context vector contains term weights that are based on another modified form of the BM11 term weight as follows: context x . The context term frequency factor borrowed the functional form of the term fre quency factor in the BM11 term weight [3]. The parameter  X  is set to 0.5 so that terms that occur more than once in the context quickly reaches the maximum value (i.e., unity). Other values that we have tried does not produce better results than  X  = 0.5. Let the matching score M (.) between contexts of document D and document E be: where loc ( q , D ) is the set of locations that the query term q occurs soft/hard decision parameter. We select the extended Boolean disjunction [6] for M (.) because this is consistent with the disjunctive relevance decision principle [7] which states that any part of the document being relevant to the topic implies the whole document is relevant. This prin ciple is consistent with the relevance judgment policy for TREC ad hoc retrieval tasks according to Harman [8]. We used p = 2 because we found that it gave the best results for different values of p that we have tested. Let S ( Q , D , E ) be the vector of matching scores [ M ( q M ( q B , D , E )] T where Q is the query, B is the city-block distance of document-context based similarity score, sim c (.), is: If we look at the frequency distribution of the document-context similarity score of the previous example (Figure 2), it seems that the frequency of RR pairs is larger than the frequency of RNR pairs when the context similarity score is larger than 0.1. This suggests that the context sim ilarity score is promising. We compare the MK1 score [9] of query-specific clustering using document similarities and that using document-context similarities for TREC-2, TREC-6 and TREC-7 ad hoc test collections. Lower MK1 score means better results. We varied the relative importance parameter  X  of the MK1 score to give different relative weights to reca ll and precision. The context size is set to 61 terms (i.e., 30 terms each on the left and the right). We found that the results were not very different using different context sizes (from 31 to 71). We carried out the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks two-tail tests to compare the MK1 values. Table 1 shows the results of the comparison. For all the reference TREC test collections used here and for all experimented, the MK1 values us ing document-context similarity are smaller than the correspondi ng MK1 values using document similarity. If recall and precision are equally important (i.e., 1), then p  X  0.05 for all the TREC test collections. This paper shows that query-sp ecific document clustering based on document-context similarity is more effective than based on document similarity for the reference TREC test collections. We found that combining context similarities using (extended Boolean) disjunction is effective. Therefore, we believe that document clustering based on doc ument-context similarity deserves further research. This work is supported by the CERG Project # PolyU 5199/04E.
