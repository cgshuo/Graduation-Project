 In this study, we analyze an educational search engine log for shedding light on K-12 students X  search behavior in a learning environment. We specially focus on query, session, user and click characteristics and compare the trends to the findings in the literature for general web search engines. Our analysis helps understanding how students search with the purpose of learning in an educational vertical, and reveals new directions to improve the search performance in the education domain.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage Systems ]: Information Re-trieval Systems
Search is a key web activity among all kinds of users to-wards a large variety of goals. While the lion X  X  share of previ-ous works on query analysis focus on general web search, the need for analyzing the search behavior of certain user groups and/or users searching for a certain type of information has emerged as an important research direction. Recent stud-ies show that children and teenagers, who constitute a large and dynamic subset of web users, deserve special attention as their search behaviour differ from the adults in several ways while using search engines [6, 3, 2]. Other studies ad-dress alternative search tasks that are usually carried out via verticals, and analyze query logs obtained from the sys-tems specialized for digital libraries, audio-visual archives and earching people on the web [8].

In this paper, we analyze the query logs of a commercial educational content developer and service provider for Turk-Figure 1: Vitamin search GUI for the query carbon dioxide (with annotations in English) ish students at K-12 level. Turkey has the youngest popu-lation in Western Europe (by median age) and 42.9% of its total population, which is estimated to be around 77 millions as of December 2013, is young, i.e., younger than 24 years old. According to national statistics, the number of students at primary and secondary schools adds up to 16,156,519 (excluding pre-school and open-education students) 1 . Not surprisingly, there are several governmental and industrial efforts to develop education services and products target-commercial web-based educational framework that provides interactive content and performance assessment mechanisms for a large variety of courses covered in K-12 curriculum in Turkey. As of December 2013, Vitamin has more than 1.2 million registered users and about 4.3 million site visits per month. These users can utilize the navigational interface to reach to the content they need, or they can perform search over the entire set of educational materials (Figure 1).
Following the practice in [8], we provide the characteris-tics of search in Vitamin with respect to four major dimen-sions; namely, queries, sessions, users, and clicked results. We also compare and contrast our findings to those on gen-eral web search engines and/or earlier results on children X  X  search behaviors. Our analysis helps understanding how stu-dents search with the purpose of learning in an educational vertical, and reveals new directions to improve the search performance in the education domain. http://sgb.meb.gov.tr/istatistik/
Vitamin search engine allows users to issue a keyword query along with a number of category filters, namely, con-tent type, grade, and course filters. Figure 1 shows the GUI of the Vitamin X  X  search system for the query  X  X arbon diox-ide X . Then, users can click and display a particular query result, which is called a learning object and presented in text and/or audio-visual formats; or navigate to certain point in a topic hierarchy where this learning object belongs to. The system stores the queries and clicked results in the search log, while the navigational type of interaction is recorded separately as a different kind of event. Therefore, our pre-liminary analysis here involves a query log that includes a sample from the queries submitted to Vitamin X  X  search sys-tem in December 2013 by the logged-in users (i.e., with pay-ing or trial accounts), and followed by at least one click on the displayed results.

Query characteristics. According to Table 1, 27.8% of the query volume are unique queries and 69.3% of the latter are singletons, i.e., asked only once. These values differ from the web search trends, where 50% of the queries in a typical search log are unique and 88% of them are singletons [1]; and more similar to the trends obtained for a vertical for searching people [8]. This means that the queries are more likely to be repeated in this educational search engine, which is a good news for the mechanisms that exploit temporal locality, such as caching. On the other hand, distribution of query frequencies shown in Figure 2 (left plot) confirms the power law distribution characteristics as in the case of web search [1]. Figure 2: Distribution of query frequencies (left) and session lengths (right). The x-axis represents the rank according to the query frequency (session length) in the left (right) plot, respectively.

On the average, a query includes 2.16 terms, which is slightly shorter than typical web queries (around 2.5 terms as reported in [1]) as well as the queries submitted to a major web search engine by the users between 10 and 18 years old (around 2.6 terms [6]). This difference might be attributed to the fact that the educational search setup is a more re-stricted domain than web and even a couple of terms can yield the relevant resources from the available content.
Table 2 lists top-10 most frequent queries, which yields interesting findings. First, top-2 queries are  X  X ames X  and  X  X ame X , which means that the students enjoy the educa-tional games provided by this system. Among the remain-ing 8 queries, 3 of them are simply the course names and too general to be useful (i.e.,  X  X cience X ,  X  X ath X ,  X  X urkish X ). This implies that the students who want to find a certain course still use the search box, rather than browsing through the list of courses. The other popular queries are related to Turkish and Math courses, and might be related to the top-ics that are being discussed in these courses at this time of the year.

As mentioned before, Vitamin X  X  search interface allows setting various filters along with a query, which we analyze next. Figure 3 shows the distribution of content type filters selected while submitting queries. It is seen that all content types are selected in the majority of the queries, which is the default setting in the GUI. This means that users leave this filter as-is most of the time, probably because they want to see all available content relevant to their query. We observe similar trends for the use of course filter, as shown in Fig-ure 5. In contrast, the grade filter, at a first look, seems to be used more effectively as the majority (more than 70%) of the searches are restricted to a certain grade level (Figure 4); grades 5, 6 and 7 being the most popular ones. However, this difference in the behavior may not necessarily be caused by the students X  awareness of this filter, as the search GUI for the trial accounts, by default, shows only the user X  X  own grade level as selected. Therefore, for most of the searches, we can still claim that students are reluctant to change the default filter settings, confirming the results in [4]. This is an interesting finding that deserves further analysis, as it can provide useful insight for designing a better search interface. Figure 3: Distribution of content type filters used in queries.
Query Volume (%) Figure 9: Distribution of result-clicks by content type (left) and rank (right). a non-negligible fraction of clicks for the results placed at much lower ranks, even after rank 20. According to a gen-eral web search engine log [5], clicks for top-2 results account for 58% of all clicks and only 9% of clicks are below rank 10. However, in our log, top-2 clicks and clicks after rank 10 constitute 36% and 20% of all clicks, respectively. This might either indicate the students X  dissatisfaction of the re-sults, or their preference to see several relevant results while learning a topic. In our future work, we plan to conduct user studies to gain more insights into students X  search be-haviour. Furthermore, the existence of clicks at lower ranks indicates that there might be room for improving the rank-ing algorithm, which is another future work direction.
In this work, we presented an in-depth analysis of a query log from a popular K-12 educational search system with real user queries. Our analysis revealed that the trends in this context differ from general web search in various aspects, which might be exploited for building educational search engines that are better tailored for students X  needs and be-haviors. In particular, the high fraction of repeated queries indicates that system components that rely on the query history (such as caching and query suggestion) can be made more effective. The students X  preferences in using the query filters call for reconsidering the design of the search inter-face. Finally, our result-click analysis shows that students prefer active content formats (like animations and interac-tive lectures) over the static content (like text) and can click further lower ranks in the results list other than the first few results. Such findings can help designing better features for the machine-learned ranking algorithms and lead higher user satisfaction, which is our future research direction.
