 This paper presents a user stud y aiming to investigate the query reformulation in collaborative Web search. 7 pairs of participants were recruited and each pair worked as a team on two collaborative exploratory Web search tasks. Through the log analysis, we compared possible sources for participants to draw query terms from. The results show that both search and collaborative actions are possible resources for new query terms. Traditional resources for query expansion such as previous search histories and relevant documents are still important resources for new query terms. The content in chat and workspace generated by participants themselves seems mo re likely to be the resource for new query terms than that of their partners. Task types also affect the influences on query reformulations. For the academic task, previously saved relevance docu ments are the most important resources for new query terms while chat histories are the most important resources for the leisure task. H.3 .3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Query formulation; H.5.3 [ Information Interfaces and Presentation ]: Group and Organization Interfaces  X  Collabor ative computing, Computer-supported cooperative work Collaborative Web search, query reformulation When the information needs are complex and explorative, it may be in the searchers X  best interests to collaboratively explore the information space and participate in shared learning [8]. Although information seeking has been traditi onally studied as an individual search activity, collaborative in formation seeking behavior has attracted much attention [5]. Complex and explorative Web searches often involve iterative in teraction with retrieval systems, so that query formulation and reformulation have been important topics in individual explorative searches, which cover issues like patterns of query reformulation [3] and the reliable sources for query expansion [4]. However, as a much more complex form of explorative search, collaborative web searches have seldom been the focus for query reformulation. A few studies on query reformulation in collaborative information retrieval have been task description on which the user is currently working. Team members can also post their comments below the task description. The search frame connects the user X  X  query to Google and displays the Google search results. Users can also see their search histories as well as those of their teammates. Users examine search results for relevant inform ation, and can sa ve a whole Web page or a snippet of the page. All the saved web pages and snippets, collected by the user and the teammate, are stored in the team workspace frame. Users can click to view more details of an item in the workspace or comment on any item. 14 participants (7 pairs) were recruited from the University of Pittsburgh for this study. 10 of these participants are male and 4 are female. All of them are experienced searchers. All the participants signed up as pairs and the members of each pair knew each other before the study so that it was easy for them to form a team. Participants in the same team worked on the same task simultaneously. As we were trying to simulate remotely-located collaboration, the participants we re in different cubicles and no face-to-face communication was allowed. Two exploratory web search tasks were used in this study. Both of them had been used in other collaborative web search studies [6, 7]. One task (T1) is related to academic work, which asks participants to collect information for a report on the effect of social networking service and soft ware [7]. The other task (T2), which is about leisure activities, asks participants to collect information for planning a trip to Helsinki [6]. Morris X  [5] identified that travel planning and academic literature search are two common collaborative search tasks. Therefore, both tasks here are representative in studying collaborative web search. The task description carefully states the kind of information that the participants need to collect and the goal is to collect as many relevant snippets as possible. The experiment procedure was: each team worked on both tasks. The order of the two tasks was rotated to avoid the learning and fatigue effect. During the experiment, after being introduced to the study and the system, and filli ng out an entry questionnaire to establish their search background, these participants worked on a training task to get familiar with the system for 15 minutes. Then they worked on task 1 or task 2, depending on the task order assigned for each team. They had 30 minutes for each task. At the end of each task, each of them also worked on a post-search questionnaire. Before the end of th e experiment, participants were interviewed for their experience with both tasks. In order to identify the possible sources for participants to draw query terms from, we first need to analyze what actions the participants have taken during the whole exploratory Web search. Typical actions recognized in this study and listed in Table 1 include Query, View, Collect, Workspace, Topic and Chat. All these actions were categorized and mapped from the transaction logs recorded in CollabSearch system. Given a previous search query q n-1 and its follow-up reformulation q , we are interested in: 1) what are the new terms in q n compared with q n-1 ; 2) what are the possible sources that influence the uses In this section, we report results on those actions that aim for search only and are not closely related to the collaboration between two team members. They are T, Q, V, S and W, which can also be found in individual searches. Figure 2 shows the probabilities of finding new query te rms in each type of actions in two different task settings. The left part of Figure 2 shows results of T1 (academic search). We observed the highest probability of finding new query terms from saved documents (S) and view ed documents (V). It is not surprising that the relevant contexts associated with the two types of actions (S and V) can suggest useful terms in the search topic for the participants. Comparatively, we found lower probability of finding new terms in W than S. This is also reasonable considering the fact that W includes information of all historically found documents, but the focus of the participants may evolve during search. Thus, it is not surprising that the recently saved articles (S) may better suggest new query terms to the user. Participants may also get indi cations of new query terms by checking the topic statement (T), but the likelihood is lower than that from S and V. Such results are also consistent with the nature of T1, for which relevant documents are mostly related to several topics and thus the topic-related relevance feedback is likely to work. In comparison, we observed differences in results of T2 (travel planning), as shown in the right part of Figure 2. Comparatively, S and V are not the most possible s ources for the new query terms. This may indicate that the nature and difficulty of these two tasks are very different. Documents sa ved in workspace may still be indicative of participants X  releva nt judgments. However, in T2, topical relatedness may not serve as the main criteria for a document X  X  relevance. For exampl e, when planning a trip, the homepage of Hilton hotels may provide topically relevant results, but participants may not select it for some other reasons. Thus, it is not surprising that the probability of finding new terms from S is comparatively lower than that of from many of the other actions, e.g. C, T, and QP (we will further discuss the indication of these actions in the following sections). V has very low probability of observing the new query terms, which may again indicate the differences in nature and diffi culty between T1 and T2. For example, it may suggest the T2 is more difficult in nature so that the majority of webpages checked by participants are irrelevant. Besides, it may also indicate that in such exploratory tasks, it is fairly difficult for participants to just view results X  snippets to correctly evaluate the usefulness of a webpage. Instead, the participants may need to frequently check the whole page. In both tasks, we found very cl ear trends that, although within a short range (k&lt;5) the user is unlikely to reuse terms in previous queries, it is still fairly common that the participants may get back to adopt previously used query terms within proper range of actions (k&gt;=5). Such results are also consistent with previous studies, e.g. participants X  previous search histories are found to be reliable resources for relevance feedback and can consistently improve search results [4]. In conclusion, there is no surpri sing difference between our results of collaborative search and previ ous studies of individual search dominating factor in us ers X  search behaviors. Existing techniques for individual searches (e.g. rele vance feedback by query history and click through) could still he lp users X  collaborative searches. As the search history of both team members are shown in the search frame, it is a possible resource for new query terms. Q as a resource for new query terms indicates that the participants reused the query terms they had used before. QP being a resource for new query terms suggests that the participants got ideas of new query terms from his/her partner X  X  search history. The results in Table 2 show that the probability of QP being the resource for new query terms is slightly higher than that of P in both tasks. However, there is no significant difference between Q and QP. This may suggest that the query terms in both the participant X  X  and their partner X  X  search histories are equally important for future use. To a certain extent, this evidenced that the participants adopted their partner X  search voca bularies for their own searches. Shared team workspace is another important way for implicit communication between team members. Figure 2 shows that W and WP are important resources for new query terms in task T1. This is understandable as the wo rkspace contains the previously saved results. For T1, the topical relevance is the major criterion for finding relevant documents, wh ich means that previous results are important resources for new que ry terms. W and WP are less likely to be sources for new query terms according to our results. This indicates that T2 is more difficult since participants were unable to generate many new que ry terms from the previously found documents. By comparing W and WP, we can see that the probability of W being the source for new query terms is significantly higher than that of WP. In other words, the participants are more likely to generate new query terms from their own saved results. This may indicate that team members divide the search topic into sub-topics and each of them is in charge of part of the sub-topics. The focus of this section is on further comparison between the influences of search actions and that of collaborative actions on the participants X  query reformulation. In individual searches, the previously clicked documents can be seen as rele vant documents, which are important resources for query reformulation. Therefore, we selected V, S, and W actions, which represent the types of resources that users can encounter in individual searches. CP, WP and QP represent the type of resources that users can meet only in collaborative searches from their partners. We examined the joint influence of search (V+S+W) vs. collaborative actions (CP+WP+QP) by the probability of finding new query term X from any of the search or collaborative actions within the range of k actions. Note that the joint influence of multiple actions is not the sum of P(X, A) for those actions. As shown in Table 2, the combina tion of V, S and W is less likely to be the source for new query terms compared with the combination of CP, WP and QP in T1. For academic search tasks, although each of the three acti ons (i.e. V, S, W) are very important sources for query term s separately, a combination does not increase the probability of finding new query terms remarkably. This may indicate that V, S and W seem to be homogenous resources for users to obtain new query terms. By homogenous we mean these resources are likely to be the sources for the same query terms. On the other hand, WP, CP and QP seem to be heterogeneous re sources for new query terms. Therefore, combining them together significantly increases the probability of finding new query te rms. This reveals a benefit of collaborative search, i.e. helping participants generate diverse ideas for query terms that may not exist in previously seen documents.
