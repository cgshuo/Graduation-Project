 We give an overview of WIDM 2012, held in conjunction with CIKM 2012 in Maui, Hawaii. WIDM 2012 is the twelfth in a series of international workshops on Web Information and Data Management held in conjunction with CIKM since 1998. The objective of the workshop is to bring together re-searchers and industrial practitioners to present and discuss leading research into how web data and information can be extracted, stored, analyzed, and processed to provide use-ful knowledge to end users for advanced database and web applications.

The objective of the WIDM 2012 workshop is to bring together relevant researchers, industrial practitioners, and developers to present and discuss leading research develop-ments in the overlap of communities involved in Web in-formation management. The focus of the WIDM workshop continues to be as relevant to the CIKM community now as when it first appeared with CIKM 1998. With the increas-ing explosion of information on the Web (for example, linked data, and social media), the WIDM activity remains a vi-brant venue for the appearance of high impact new results in the field.
