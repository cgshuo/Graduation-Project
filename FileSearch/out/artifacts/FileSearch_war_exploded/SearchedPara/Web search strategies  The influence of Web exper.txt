 1. Introduction
Numerous models and theories ( Belkin, 1980; Marchionini, 1995; Saracevic, Kantor, Chamis, &amp; Trivision, 1988; Sutcliffe &amp; Ennis, 1998; Wilson, 1997 ) have suggested that knowledge, or experience, with systems (i.e. information retrieval systems, information seeking systems or electronic systems) plays an important role in determining the type of search strategy that is adopted as well as the efficacy of the search process. In addi-tion, a number of studies (e.g. Aula &amp; Nordhausen, 2006; Bilal, 2000; Chevalier &amp; Kicka, 2006; Navarro-Pri-eto, Scaife, &amp; Rogers, 1999; Wang, Hawk, &amp; Tenopir, 2000 ) have also indicated that system knowledge (i.e. knowledge of computer systems, hypertext systems and Web systems) might have influenced the results of their studies. Marchionini (1995) , however, argues that experience in a particular search system is less impor-tant than other types of expertise, such as domain expertise and information seeking expertise.

Practically, the more time someone spends online, the more likely they are to be familiar with the search environment and to acquire searching skills in that environment ( Hargittai, 2002 ). The theoretical rationale from cognitive psychology suggests that prior experience in a particular electronic system is likely to provide a framework for the user X  X  mental model of the particular target system ( Borgman, 1986; Kim &amp; Hirtle, 1995 ).
Given that one X  X  mental model is derived (at least in part) from experiences with a system, this implies that different types and levels of experience would lead to different mental models and varying degrees of accuracy and completeness ( Taylor &amp; Tversky, 1992 ). Knowledge about a particular search system is crucial, as the sys-tem determines the way in which information is  X  X  X tructured X  X  and delimits the strategies that can be applied to finding that information within the system X  X  organisation. It must be acknowledged that there are also other types of system knowledge that play a role in understanding information seeking within electronic databases such as knowledge of search engines, hypertext system knowledge, computer system knowledge, or general information seeking knowledge.

Searching for information on the Web is a common activity for many hundreds of millions of people around the World. Internet World Stats (2007) estimates that there are now more than one billion people con-nected to the Internet and a large proportion of these people utilise the Web frequently. Prior to the predom-inance of the Web, searching on electronic databases was usually conducted, or facilitated, by someone skilled in the use of that database, such as a librarian ( Jenkins, Corritore, &amp; Weidenbeck, 2003 ). However, due to the ubiquity of the Web and search engines most of these users will have no formal training in the use of these searching facilities. It is suspected that expertise is largely achieved through trial-and-error experience aug-mented with shared experiences from other people who use the Web.

The variable of computer  X  X  X xperience X  X  is seldom assessed in a uniform manner in computer research stud-ilar problems emerge. Previous studies have defined experienced/expert users as computer science students ( Navarro-Prieto et al., 1999 ), PhD students in Educational Technology ( Brand-Gruwel, Wopereis, &amp; Vermet-ten, 2005 ), PhD in Human X  X omputer Interaction and five years related working experience ( Song &amp; Salvendy, week ( Chevalier &amp; Kicka, 2006; Hargittai, 2002 ), more than 50 h of Web experience in total ( Lazonder, 2000; Lazonder, Biemans, &amp; Wopereis, 2000 ), one year or more using the Web ( Jenkins et al., 2003 ), two years or more using the Web ( Palmquist &amp; Kim, 2000 ), 5 h or more per week ( Khan &amp; Locatis, 1998 ), a self-rating
Likert-type scale ( Liaw &amp; Huang, 2006 ), as searching performance ( Aula &amp; Nordhausen, 2006; Leroy, Lally, &amp; Chen, 2003 ), or have simply not provided this information ( Bilal, 2000 ). Similarly, inexperienced/novice users have been described as Psychology students ( Brand-Gruwel et al., 2005; Navarro-Prieto et al., 1999 ), using the Web about once a month ( Chevalier &amp; Kicka, 2006 ), less than 1 h per week online ( Hargittai, 2002 ), less than one year of Web use ( Jenkins et al., 2003 ), less than 10 h online in total ( Lazonder et al., 2000 ), had never used the Web ( Palmquist &amp; Kim, 2000; Pollock &amp; Hockley, 1997 ), or simply did not provide any information on their categorisation ( Ho  X  lscher &amp; Strube, 2000 ).

The psychological literature on expertise distinguishes between the information-processing approach and the abilities approach ( Reed, 1998 ). In the information-processing approach knowledge, skills and expertise are acquired through experience whereas in the abilities approach it is believed that innate abilities lead to superior performance. Sternberg (1998) argued that the assessment of abilities was actually the assessment of different stages of expertise. The particular expert characteristics relevant for this study include the follow-ing: spend proportionately less time searching than determining how to represent the problem space; solve problems quicker than novices; are more accurate in solving problems than novices; have rich, interconnected, and well-organised schemas to represent the problem domain; and work from given information to devise strategies to find the unknown information ( Sternberg, 1998 ). The absence of these characteristics is indicative of a novice ( Sternberg, 2006 ).

Studies that use experience as a variable seldom have a theoretical framework on which to base their allo-cations. Fisher (1991) provides some order to the confusion by distinguishing between depth and breadth of experience. A similar recommendation was made by Aula and Nordhausen (2006) who proposed that the Web experience measure should incorporate aspects of frequency of use and length of use. The breadth dimension might be assessed on a scale from a na X   X  ve to an expert user. The depth dimension might be assessed on a scale from a novice to an experienced user. A novice is someone who has little or no experience with a particular task, whereas a na X   X  ve user does not have the requisite underlying reasoning or analytical skills with a partic-ular system ( Fisher, 1991 ). Fisher (1991) noted that the breadth and depth dimensions were not necessarily independent at a practical level. A person first encountering a Web browser without any previous interaction with a computer system may be both a novice and na X   X  ve, while someone who has spent many years coming to understand the underlying dynamics of computer systems may be a novice Web browser but an expert com-puter user who can apply those abilities to become an experienced user or even an expert user.

This study investigates whether Web experience has an influence on the choice of cognitive search strategies for information seeking on the Web. Web experience is not defined dichotomously, but as a continuous var-iable based on the combination of depth and breadth of experience. The study also looks at how Web expe-rience might influence two different types of tasks, a directed search task and a general-purpose browsing task.
These two tasks have quite different goals which may, in turn, influence the choice of search strategy. In addi-tion, the influence of Web experience is examined across researcher-defined tasks and participant-defined tasks since most of the previous studies have focused on researcher-defined tasks which may limit the cognitive search strategies available to information seekers. The following section reviews the past literature on Web experience and information seeking on the Web. 1.1. Research rationale
While a number of studies have looked at the effects of system expertise on information seeking behaviour with traditional electronic databases (e.g. Fenichel, 1981; Hsieh-Yee, 1993; Jacobson &amp; Fusani, 1992; Mar-chionini, Dwiggins, Katz, &amp; Lin, 1993; Qiu, 1993 ) the results of these studies cannot simply be applied to
Web searching due to the sheer size and complexity of the Web environment. Instead, the studies reviewed here will focus on Web searching. Jansen and Spink (2006) categorised Web searching studies into three groups: (1) experiments with users in a laboratory or natural setting; (2) log-file analysis using client-side or server-side transactional recording and analysis; and (3) surveys or other issues affecting Web searching.
While cognitive search strategies might be extracted from log-files, Web experience cannot. Due to the nature of extracting and describing Web search strategies and determining Web experience, this study therefore focuses on experimental findings from laboratory and other natural settings where past experience with the Web was assessed.

In the only survey research reviewed here, Liaw and Huang (2006) found that the more experience that respondents had with search engines the more likely they were to choose search engines on the basis of their perceived characteristics (directory-based or query-based search engines), and to choose search engines on the basis of the perceived precision of results. Liaw and Huang X  X  (2006) results are important since they imply that experienced users X  preconceptions about the qualities of search engines guide their search engine strategy choices, but that novice users do not appear to have a particular search engine strategy. In another study focused on search engine use, Bilal (2000) investigated the search strategies of participants using  X  X  X ahooli-gans X  X  and classified the search tactics as browsing (reading over information and selecting information to focus on) and searching (using search engine queries). Bilal (2000) found that participants with prior Web experience were more likely to have a successful search.

In an early Web investigation, Pollock and Hockley (1997) found that na X   X  ve Web users failed to conceptu-alise the scope of the Web and did not properly understand that information on the Web was not systemat-ically organised. Na X   X  ve users struggled to formulate an appropriate query, had difficulty choosing key search terms and were unimpressed with the disorganised and inappropriate search results found by search engines.
However, since they did not compare these participants to a more experienced group, it is difficult to deter-mine whether the problems encountered were due to the lack of experience or the poor design of search engines at the time. Debowski (2001) found that novices had an average of two redundant actions, appeared to start a new search approximately every 6 min, made numerous spelling mistakes, did not use online assis-tance facilities, used irrelevant keywords, and used Boolean logic operators incorrectly. Debowski (2001) con-cluded that the searches were fragmented and uncoordinated resulting in poor search outcomes. Debowski (2001) used no  X  X  X xpert X  X  comparison group with which to compare any of the search performance measures.
Palmquist and Kim (2000) found no main effect differences for Web experience on the average length of time and average number of steps although there was an interaction effect with cognitive style (field dependence/ independence) for novices but not experts. In an extension of Palmquist and Kim X  X  (2000) data, Kim (2001) found that the expert group used significantly more  X  X  X ump X  X  tools (e.g. History list,  X  X  X o to X  X  option, and  X  X  X ind X  X  option) and novices went significantly deeper into websites. However, there were no significant differences between experts and novices in the number of embedded links used or the use of the  X  X  X ome X  X  but-ton. Hargittai (2002) found that the more time users had previously spent on the Web and the longer the time since first using the Web, the more likely they were to complete more tasks in a quicker time.

In a two part study, Ho  X  lscher and Strube (2000) concluded that experts X  information seeking behaviour on the Web was characterised by frequent switching between browsing (i.e. following hyperlinks) and querying (i.e. using search engines). Additionally, they found that experts reformulated and reformatted existing que-ries, changed search engines, searched through additional pages of search results or used Boolean operators when search results were unsuccessful. In the second part of their study Ho  X  lscher and Strube (2000) found that the high Web expertise groups were able to solve more problems and used more reformatting of queries than the other groups. The high Web expertise and high domain knowledge group accessed known websites directly, used their favourite search engine, or were likely to change search engines if their search results were unsuccessful. This group was also the least likely to use the web browser X  X   X  X  X ack X  X  button. The low Web exper-tise and low domain knowledge group used the  X  X  X ack X  X  button most frequently, had the highest number of query reformulations and were reliant on information from the Web browser interface. They found that
Web expertise reduces the time spent on content pages. Lazonder et al. (2000) asked participants to find a web-site and locate a specific piece of information within that website at three different levels of difficulty (simple, moderate and complex tasks). Lazonder et al. X  X  (2000) results suggested that the Web experts could locate a website quicker, and with greater success, efficiency and effectiveness than Web novices. However, in the  X  X  X ocating information X  X  task, they found no significant differences in the search behaviours of the Web experts and Web novices. The participants were limited to the use of one particular search engine.
 In a more recent study, Chevalier and Kicka (2006) found in the first part of their study that experienced
Web users required significantly less time and fewer steps than novice Web users, but that Professional Web designers were not significantly different from novice users on these performance measures. In the second part of their study, Chevalier and Kicka (2006) used a smaller sample size and this time found that novice Web users were significantly slower and took more steps than Professional Web designers and experienced Web users. In another recent study, Aula and Nordhausen (2006) found that the number of tasks completed, the total search time, the speed of composing queries, the higher the number of terms per query, and a higher proportion of more precise queries were all related to Web expertise. Contrary to these results, Khan and
Locatis (1998) found that there were minimal differences between Web experts and novices. There were no significant differences in the number of links followed, the total search time, or searching accuracy of Web experts and novices. However, there was a significant difference in the ability of Web experts to prioritise tasks more efficiently ( Khan &amp; Locatis, 1998 ).

The majority of studies that actually assessed cognitive search strategies report differences between novices and experts. Navarro-Prieto et al. (1999) found that experienced participants used a bottom-up strategy or mixed strategies and novices used a top-down strategy in a directed search task. In the  X  X  X xploratory X  X  task the novices used a bottom-up strategy and experienced participants used a top-down strategy. Navarro-Prieto et al. (1999) concluded that the type of search task had a stronger influence on the search strategy choice for experienced users than novice users and argued that novice users were driven by the task demands (i.e. a literal interpretation of the task description) and the external representations of the Web (i.e. the structure of the task domain). On the other hand, experienced users planned their searches according to the nature of the task domain (i.e. dispersed or categorical) and carefully considered the goal of the search task (i.e. exploratory vs. directed searching).

In a more detailed analysis of Lazonder et al. X  X  (2000) data, Lazonder (2000) found that in moderate and easy tasks, Web experts were quickly able to recognise or infer the Web address from the task question.
Instead, the Web novices chose to use a search engine. In the difficult task there were no differences in strategy selection between novices and experts (i.e. they both chose to use a search engine and both tried similar query terms). The Web experts were quicker at executing their strategies for the simple task, whereas the Web nov-ices tended to make more errors or spent more time exploring the browser or search engine functions. In the more difficult tasks, the Web novices committed fewer errors and conducted fewer explorations of the browser and search engine functions. In the monitoring of search engine results, the Web experts monitored the search results faster on the difficult task than the Web novices. From an analysis of the verbal protocols, Lazonder (2000) established that the Web novices ignored important cues from the search results (such as relevance feed-back) and concentrated on obvious cues (e.g. the title or the link description).

Jenkins et al. (2003) reported similar results in combination with Web expertise and domain expertise. Web novices tended to adopt a  X  X  X readth-first X  X  strategy with very little evaluation of the results unless they were also domain experts. Web experts tended to use a mixture of  X  X  X readth-first X  X  and  X  X  X epth-first X  X  strategies and if they were also domain experts then they would follow deep paths and intensive evaluation of the infor-mation ( Jenkins et al., 2003 ). Madden, Ford, Miller, and Levy (2006) reported that children with higher prior
Web experience carried out more sophisticated searches. Examples of the higher level of sophistication were not reported other than the  X  X  X ormulation of complex queries X  X  ( Madden et al., 2006, p. 758 ) by more experi-enced students and the invention of URLs by less experienced students. Finally, Brand-Gruwel et al. (2005) reported no differences in the Web searching strategies of experts and novices although the Web experts spent significantly more time defining the problem domain and slightly more time processing the information that was found. 1.2. Research questions
The problems associated with defining Web experience have already been highlighted. These inconsistencies mean that participants might have been identified as novices in one study and as experts in another study. This makes it rather difficult to compare the results of different studies. The assessments of experience also tend to be one-dimensional (usually based on the frequency of usage) and do not incorporate aspects of depth and breadth of experience contained in Fisher X  X  (1991) conceptualisation. Apart from the inconsistencies in defin-ing Web expertise, there are also a number of other limitations with these previous studies. First, the studies on prior experience with the Web are usually hampered by small sample sizes and are often restricted to university students or high school children. Liaw and Huang (2006) , with 164 university students, have the largest sam-ple, but their study involved survey research and self-reported performance, not actual performance data. Sev-eral studies are based on small samples of high school children such as Bilal (2000) with a sample of 14,
Lazonder (2000) with a sample of 14, Madden et al. (2006) with a sample of 15, and Lazonder et al. (2000) with a sample of 25. The largest high school sample was 64 from Khan and Locatis (1998) . Similarly, the sam-ples of university students were also small. Debowski (2001) looked at 48 undergraduate students, Palmquist and Kim (2000), and Kim (2001) also had 48 undergraduate students, Navarro-Prieto et al. (1999) observed 23 students, and Aula and Nordhausen (2006) had 22 participants; 20 students and 2 researchers. In other studies Brand-Gruwel et al. (2005) had 10 participants, Jenkins et al. (2003) investigated 16 nurses, Ho  X  lscher and
Strube (2000) had 24 participants, Pollock and Hockley (1997) looked at 32 participants, Hargittai (2002) investigated 54 participants, and Chevalier and Kicka (2006) looked at 56 participants in the first part of their study and 28 participants in the second part of their study. In this study a relatively large sample of 80 par-ticipants in a range of occupations was obtained, including students and high school children.

Second, the problem with small sample sizes means that statistically significant differences were difficult to establish. Many of the studies were unable to provide support for the differences or similarities through sta-tistical comparison due to small sample sizes ( Debowski, 2001; Hargittai, 2002; Ho  X  lscher &amp; Strube, 2000; Jen-kins et al., 2003; Navarro-Prieto et al., 1999 ). Most of those studies that did report statistically significant differences usually have sample sizes that are too small to place any confidence in the findings or the genera-lisability of results ( Aula &amp; Nordhausen, 2006; Brand-Gruwel et al., 2005; Chevalier &amp; Kicka, 2006; Kim, 2001; Lazonder, 2000; Lazonder et al., 2000 ; Palmquist &amp; Kim, 2000). Again, a larger sample size in this study meant that quantitative statistical tests could be applied.

Third, in many of the studies participants were divided dichotomously into expert and novice groups. While this is useful for (statistical) comparative purposes (although this would further reduce the sample sizes in each group), such an approach loses much of the variability in expertise. From the experimental studies, only Bilal (2000), and Aula and Nordhausen (2006) treat expertise as a continuous variable. This study utilises a range of Web experience categories (including novice, expert, and intermediate groups).

Fourth, despite using the term  X  X  X trategies X  X  many of the studies reviewed do not actually describe search strategies according to Marchionini X  X  (1995) definition. Marchionini (1995) defined four levels of description in information seeking: moves, tactics, strategies and patterns. This study looks at strategies, defined by Mar-chionini (1995) as generalised approaches to particular information seeking problems. An example of a search strategy for the Web might be a search engine strategy (i.e. an information-seeker who consistently uses a search engine to search for information). Most of the studies reviewed in the rationale section actually describe tactics (groups of behaviours) such as typing specific types of queries ( Brand-Gruwel et al., 2005; Debowski, &amp; Nordhausen, 2006; Bilal, 2000; Kim, 2001 ), or performance measures such as speed of completion and num-ber of steps taken ( Chevalier &amp; Kicka, 2006; Hargittai, 2002; Khan &amp; Locatis, 1998; Lazonder et al., 2000;
Palmquist &amp; Kim, 2000 ). Those studies that did actually look at search strategies were quite limited in their identification of search strategies. Navarro-Prieto et al. (1999) identified bottom-up, top-down and mixed strategies, whereas Jenkins et al. (2003) distinguished between breadth-first and depth-first strategies. Finally, only a small number of studies directly compared different types of tasks ( Lazonder, 2000; Lazonder et al., 2000; Navarro-Prieto et al., 1999 ) and only Madden et al. (2006) looked at participant-defined tasks but did not compare searching with researcher-defined tasks.

This particular study focuses on the different cognitive search strategies (i.e. strategies that also include the generalised thoughts and intentions of the users) and how these strategies might differ between people with different levels of experience with Web searching. A larger sample size would enable statistical analyses to be conducted and would improve the robustness of the results. The two primary research questions leading from the investigation of cognitive search strategies are as follows: 2. Method 2.1. Participants The sample consisted of 80 volunteer participants from various educational and occupational backgrounds.
The demographic details of the sample are summarised in Table 1 . The sample was recruited using non-prob-ability snowball sampling. Snowballing involves approaching people known to the researcher and then asking these participants to recommend other potential participants ( Devlin, 2006 ). Participants had a range of expe-rience with computers and the Web. The range of Web experience variables for the sample are summarised in
Table 2 . 2.2. Procedure
The biographical questions, the participants X  prior use of computers and the Web were asked first, follow-ing a structured interview format. Using a one-group repeated measures design each participant completed four information seeking tasks. The ordering of the four tasks was randomly assigned to control for any learn-ing effects. The four tasks consisted of two directed fact-finding tasks and two general-purpose browsing tasks using Marchionini and Schneiderman X  X  (1988) task definitions. Two tasks were defined by the researcher (i.e.  X  X  Find Bill Clinton X  X  mother X  X  maiden name  X  X  for the directed search task and  X  X  Find all information on the rela-tionship between carbon monoxide and desertification  X  X  for the general purpose browsing task) and two tasks were chosen by the participants (i.e. a directed search task and a general purpose browsing task). Participants were given a maximum of 15 min to complete each task and could terminate the search at any point before the 15 min were up if they felt they had completed the task or they wished to stop. Participants were also able to select their preferred browser application. Each participant started each search task from the same, researcher-defined, homepage. The ordering of the tasks was randomised in order to control for any possible learning effects during the data collection. However, this would not prevent a participant (particularly inexperienced searchers) from learning during the course of a single search task. The task completion was recorded using
Lotus ScreenCam. For the retrospective verbal protocols ( Ericsson &amp; Simon, 1993 ) the ScreenCam recordings were played back to the participants after each task to determine participants X  reasons for making behavioural moves. Observational data and client-side log-files were also recorded. Fidel et al. (1999), and Navarro-Prieto et al. (1999) adopted similar methodological approaches to uncover Web search strategies. 2.3. Measures and analyses
Performance measures of: time to complete the task, number of steps (mouse clicks and webpages visited), number of queries, and number of search terms per query were extracted from the log-files and analysed using one-way ANOVA. The correctness of the answer (i.e. fully correct, partially correct, and wrong) was deter-mined from the retrospective protocols and analysed using chi-squared tests.

The derivation of the cognitive search strategies is described in more detail in Thatcher (2006) . In summary, the cognitive search strategies were derived by combining information from client-side log-files and observa-tions with the motivations, intentions, and rationalisations extracted from the retrospective verbal protocol data. Where a participant expressly indicated that they were changing their strategy, these portions of the search behaviour were analysed separately. The cognitive strategies were assigned for each of the four tasks.
Following Fidel et al. (1999) participants could have used more than one strategy during a search task. The fact that only one rater was used to identify the cognitive search strategies means that the search strategies are subjective in nature and would require additional investigations to test their robustness. Comparisons of search strategies emerging in other studies are made in Thatcher (2006) .

The Web experience questionnaire was adapted from Thatcher and Greyling (1998) and measures technical expertise with the Web based on the self-reported breadth and depth of exposure. Thatcher and Greyling (1998) report Cronbach alpha coefficients of between 0.80 and 0.74. A factor analysis of the items provided support for a two factor solution and hence support for construct validity. The internal reliability for the mod-ified Web experience scale of 11 items in this current study was a = 0.86. The questions on Web usage were not all in the same initial format (e.g. length of Web use was measured in months, self-rated Web experience was measured in a Likert-type format and Web tasks were in a checklist format). In order to summarise these dif-ferent measures into some meaningful composite score, it was necessary to convert each of these measures into the same scale format. For the purposes of the composite score, each question was converted into a five point Likert-type ordinal scale by examining the normal distribution of the responses to each question. The type of
Web task was converted into a five point Likert-type score by assigning a five point rating depending on the complexity and level of understanding of the Web needed to conduct the task. The frequency of Web use and the self-rated Web experience were already in a five point Likert-type format, therefore required no additional conversion. The composite Web experience score was calculated by multiplying the average depth score (cal-culated from the length of use, the frequency of use, the hours of use, the number of locations, the application depth level, the self-rated depth scores for levels two to five, and the self-rated computer experience) by the breadth score (calculated from the number of tasks used). While the correlations between items in the depth dimension were sometimes quite high (correlations between r = 0.13 and r = 0.83), the correlation between the important multiplicative breadth and depth dimensions ( r = 0.22) was non-significant at p &lt; .01. The compos-ite Web experience scores were converted into a five point Likert-type score based on the normal distribution of the scores. Composite scores in the upper 20% range were assigned to the highest Web experience cate-gory and composite scores in the lower 20% range were assigned to the lowest Web experience category.
This simplified the comparisons with the search strategies although would have resulted in some loss of variance.

Statistical comparisons of the cognitive search strategies were made across the four task conditions (and for each task condition) using chi-squared tests and correspondence analysis. Correspondence analysis is a variant of principal components analysis that provides a low-dimensional graphical representation of the rows and columns of a contingency table ( Greenacre &amp; Hastie, 1987 ). In correspondence analysis the dimensions have no meaning unlike factor analysis or multidimensional scaling. Rather, correspondence analysis provides a means of graphically representing the angles between the data points. 2.4. Cognitive search strategies More comprehensive descriptions of the cognitive search strategies are provided in Thatcher (2006) .
The descriptions of 12 different cognitive search strategies are summarised below (see Appendix for examples). 2.4.1.  X  X  X afe player X  X  strategies
The  X  X  X afe player X  X  strategies were characterised by one of four variants where the participant was intending to remain within a familiar search environment. The four variants were: (a) Broad first (participants would first search using one or more general search terms defined by the search task and would then use more detailed, task-specific terms if the broad strategy failed); (b) Search engine narrowing down (participants selected a search engine based on the known, or perceived, attributes of the search engine or chose the subject categories on a search engine that would assist in narrowing the search domain); (c)  X  X  X earch engine player X  X  strategy (participants used different search engines to search different portions of the Web with the same search terms based on the known, or perceived, capabilities of different search engines or would use meta-search engines to achieve the same goal); (d) Known address search domain (participants went directly to a known webpage, that was not a search engine, that could be used as another suitable portal for the particular search task or was a familiar starting point for the participant). 2.4.2.  X  X  X arallel player X  X  strategy
Participants using the  X  X  X arallel player X  X  strategy deliberately opened multiple browser windows early in the search task session to conduct different searches simultaneously (please note that the research data were col-lected before tabs were allowed by browser applications). Participants usually attempted different search approaches in each browser window (e.g. specific terms in one browser window and general terms in another; different search engines in different browser windows; or general terms in one browser window and a  X  X  X nown address search domain X  X  in another browser window). The participant was using the capabilities of browsers to conduct multiple search tactics concurrently. 2.4.3. Link-dependent strategy
Participants using the  X  X  X ink-dependent X  X  strategy relied solely on hyperlinks from the homepage to move from one webpage to another. 2.4.4.  X  X  X o-the-point X  X  strategy
Participants using the  X  X  X o-the-point X  X  strategy first used quite specific search terms with the intention of getting directly to the answer. If specific terms failed then participants would use general terms to broaden the search domain. 2.4.5. Known address strategy
Participants using the  X  X  X nown address X  X  strategy went straight to a known site where they expected to find the information being sought. 2.4.6.  X  X  X equential player X  X  strategy
The  X  X  X equential player X  X  strategy is a combination of a  X  X  X afe player X  X  and  X  X  X o-the-point X  X  strategies. Par-ticipants usually used this strategy as a means of confirming information already obtained. 2.4.7. Deductive reasoning strategy
Participants using the  X  X  X eductive reasoning X  X  strategy used search terms that appeared unrelated to the search task. The  X  X  X eductive reasoning X  X  was used by participants to reason through the task, based on their own conceptualisation of the problem domain. 2.4.8. Secondary search strategies
Secondary search strategies were those used by participants where there was no apparent initiation step and usually complemented one of the other strategies. Two secondary search strategies were identified: (a)  X  X  X irtual tourist X  X  strategy (participants followed predefined paths designed by the website developers); and (b) Parallel hub-and-spoke strategy (participants opened up hyperlinks in a new browser window in a similar manner to a hub-and-spoke pattern where the new browser window could be kept open for later reference). 3. Results
It must be noted before any results are presented, that the boundaries between the points on the Web com-posite experience rating scale are fairly arbitrary. There is no reason to suppose that a participant assigned to a level three Web experience score has statistically lower levels of experience with the Web than a participant assigned to a level four Web experience. However, it is still reasonable to assume that the higher the Web expe-rience score, the greater a participant X  X  experience with the Web. It is also clear from this argument, that assigning a three point or a seven point rating scale would be just as arbitrary. 3.1. Search performance measures and Web experience
While the two highest Web experience scores consistently had the fastest completion times and the most number of terms per query, none of these differences were statistically significant. The only statistically signif-icant difference was in the researcher-defined, directed search task where the highest Web experience score used significantly more search queries than with other Web experience scores. These results are summarised in Table 3 . The chi-squared tests revealed that there were only significant differences in the correctness of the answers and Web experience for the researcher-defined, general purpose browsing task ( v (d.f. = 8,1), p &lt; .01). The two highest Web experience scores had significantly more correct answers for this task. 3.2. Cognitive search strategies and Web experience The frequencies of the strategies across the five Web experience scores for all four tasks are presented in Table 4 and the correspondence analysis is represented in Fig. 1 .

The chi-squared test of association shows that the strategies were unevenly distributed across the five Web experience scores ( v 2 = 77.67 (d.f. = 44.1), p &lt; .01). A number of important points can be drawn from Table 4 .
Firstly, it is evident that the  X  X  X afe player X  X  strategies (except for the  X  X  X nown address search domain X  X  strategy) were more closely associated with lower levels of Web experience and that the two parallel strategies ( X  X  X arallel player X  X  and  X  X  X arallel hub-and-spoke X  X  strategies) were more closely associated with higher levels of Web expe-rience. The correspondence analysis representation, with two dimensions explaining 69% of the inertia, in
Fig. 1 , demonstrates the  X  X  X earch engine player X  X  and  X  X  X eductive reasoning X  X  strategies were most closely asso-ciated with the lowest level of Web experience, and the  X  X  X road first X  X  and  X  X  X earch engine narrowing down X  X  strategies were most closely associated with the second lowest level of Web experience. The third level of Web experience did not appear to be closely associated with any of the strategies. The two highest levels of
Web experience were associated with the  X  X  X arallel player X  X  and  X  X  X arallel hub-and-spoke X  X , with the  X  X  X nown address search domain X  X  strategy also being reasonably closely associated.
 3.3. Cognitive search strategies and Web experience across the four tasks
In order to specify the relationship between Web experience and the strategies, contingency tables and cor-respondence analyses were conducted for each of the four task conditions. The contingency table for the researcher-defined, directed search task is presented in Table 5 .

It is evident from Table 5 that three search strategies were not used by any of the participants in this task (the  X  X  X nown address X  X ,  X  X  X irtual tourist X  X  and  X  X  X arallel hub-and-spoke X  X  strategies). A chi-squared test of asso-ciation in Table 4 shows that the strategies were not significantly different across the five Web experience scores ( v 2 = 43.36 (d.f. = 32,1), p = 0.09). The correspondence analysis (see Fig. 2 ), with two dimensions explaining 85% of the inertia was more explanatory than the contingency table. Fig. 2 demonstrates that only the highest Web experience level was clearly distinguishable from the other Web experience levels. This level was associated with the  X  X  X nown address search domain X  X  and the  X  X  X earch engine player X  X  strategies. The  X  X  X eductive reasoning X  X ,  X  X  X earch engine narrowing down X  X ,  X  X  X equential Player X  X  and  X  X  X o-the-point X  X  strategies were quite closely associated with the second lowest Web experience level.

The contingency table for the researcher-defined, general purpose browsing task is presented in Table 6 and the correspondence analysis is represented in Fig. 3 .

Two search strategies were not used by any of the participants in this task; the  X  X  X irtual tourist X  X  strategy and the  X  X  X nown address X  X  strategy. The chi-squared test of association in Table 6 showed that the strategies were not significantly different across the five Web experience scores ( v correspondence analysis, with two dimensions explaining 77% of the inertia is more explanatory than the con-tingency table.

Contrary to Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 demonstrates that the two highest Web experience levels were clearly distinguish-able from the other Web experience levels. The two highest Web experience levels were most closely associated with the  X  X  X arallel player X  X  and the  X  X  X arallel hub-and-spoke X  X  strategy and the highest Web experience level was also associated with the  X  X  X nown address search domain X  X  strategy. The lowest Web experience level was most closely associated with the  X  X  X earch engine player X  X  and  X  X  X equential player X  X  strategies.

The contingency table for the participant-defined, directed search task is presented in Table 7 and the cor-respondence analysis is represented in Fig. 4 .

A chi-squared test of association in Table 7 showed that the strategies were not significantly different across the five Web experience scores ( v 2 = 42.23 (d.f. = 44.1), p = 0.55). The correspondence analysis, with two dimensions only explaining 38% of the inertia is perhaps more explanatory than the contingency table. Con-trary to Fig. 3 , Fig. 4 demonstrates that the second highest Web experience level was clearly distinguishable from the other Web experience levels being most closely associated with the  X  X  X arallel player X  X  and the  X  X  X arallel hub-and-spoke X  X  strategies and the highest level with the  X  X  X o-the-point X  X  strategy and the  X  X  X eductive reason-ing X  X  strategy in this particular task. Rather confusingly, these two strategies were also closely associated with the lowest Web experience level.

The contingency table for the participant-defined, general purpose browsing task is presented in Table 8 and the correspondence analysis is represented in Fig. 5 .

A chi-squared test of association in Table 8 showed that the strategies were not significantly different across the five Web experience scores ( v 2 = 42.23 (d.f. = 44.1), p = 0.55). The correspondence analysis, with two dimensions explained 65% of the inertia.

Contrary to Figs. 2 X 4 , the representation in Fig. 5 demonstrated that the second highest and the second lowest Web experience levels were most closely associated with the  X  X  X nown address X  X  strategy and the  X  X  X road first X  X  strategy. The highest Web experience level was associated with the  X  X  X arallel hub-and-spoke X  X ,  X  X  X equen-tial player X  X  and  X  X  X nown address search domain strategies X  X . The lowest level of Web experience was most clo-sely associated with the  X  X  X earch engine narrowing down X  X ,  X  X  X o-the-point X  X  and  X  X  X irtual tourist X  X  strategies.
It is clear from the correspondence analysis representations that the strategies change in relation to the Web experience level with each task condition. A participant with a particular Web experience level uses different cognitive search strategies according to the task. The changing of strategy was clearer with higher levels of
Web experience, than the lower levels of Web experience. 4. Discussion 4.1. Web experience and search performance
The absence of statistically significant differences on the performance measures for the different experience levels across the four different tasks is supported by Brand-Gruwel et al. (2005), Khan and Locatis (1998) , and Palmquist and Kim (2000) but contradicts other research findings (e.g. Aula &amp; Nordhausen, 2006; Chevalier &amp;
Kicka, 2006; Hargittai, 2002; Ho  X  lscher &amp; Strube, 2000; Lazonder et al., 2000 ). Further, Lazonder (2000) found no differences between the novices and experts on a difficult task, with each participant using a search engine and similar search terms. Some of the inconsistencies in these findings can be attributed to the various methods used to determine expertise as well as the relatively small sample sizes. In most instances in this study, the two highest levels of Web experience completed the task in the fastest times and used more terms in each query.
These differences, however, were not statistically significant. In the researcher-defined tasks, the highest expe-rience level participants also completed more search steps in quicker times. This pattern was not evident in the two participant-defined tasks. The results also demonstrate that the only significant differences emerged in researcher-defined tasks. When researchers define tasks they restrict the search strategies and might also place unrealistic pressures on participants. The combination of these factors may produce spurious significant per-formance differences between  X  X  X xperts X  X  and  X  X  X ovices X  X . 4.2. Web Experience and the cognitive search strategies The analyses conducted across the four tasks and within each task show some interesting patterns. In the
Web experience analyses it was relatively clear that the highest experience levels could be distinguished from the lowest experience levels on the basis of the search strategies used, as shown in Figs. 1 X 5 . This distinction was most easily seen in the two general purpose tasks and was less distinct in the two directed search tasks.
Across the four tasks the  X  X  X arallel Player X  X  and  X  X  X arallel hub-and-spoke X  X  strategies and, to a lesser extent, the  X  X  X nown address search domain X  X  and  X  X  X nown address X  X  strategies were most closely associated with higher Web experience ( Fig. 1 ). The lowest levels of Web experience were associated with the  X  X  X irtual tourist X  X  and  X  X  X ink-dependent X  X  strategies which do not involve using a search engine. These experience levels are also associated with the  X  X  X earch engine player X  X ,  X  X  X o-the-point X  X ,  X  X  X equential player X  X ,  X  X  X earch engine narrowing X  X , and  X  X  X road first X  X  strategies which do involve search engines and the use of queries. This partially contradicts
Pollock and Hockley (1997) who claimed that na X   X  ve users had problems formulating queries, although partic-ipants in this study had some prior Web experience. Jenkins et al. (2003) , however, also found that Web nov-ices tended to use the  X  X  X readth first X  X  strategy (essentially the same strategy as  X  X  X road first X  X ) although Web experts used the  X  X  X epth first X  X  strategy (similar to the  X  X  X o-the-point X  X  strategy). It seems rather obvious that searching with multiple browser windows requires a higher degree of familiarity with the web browser func-tions. It was also clear that searching with multiple browser windows required significant cognitive resources.
Participants using these strategies had to pay attention to more than one searching session at a time, con-stantly reminding themselves of the search and the progress in that search. Participants who have less expe-rience with the Web would need to devote their cognitive resources to the search task at hand within a complex searching environment rather than spend extra cognitive resources switching between browser win-dows. It also seems obvious that higher levels of experience would be associated with the  X  X  X nown address X  X  and  X  X  X nown address search domain X  X  strategies. Participants who had used the Web frequently would be more familiar with areas of the Web where one would be likely to find information. In the participant-defined tasks, participants with a high level of experience would also be more likely to know an exact webpage where information could be found.

The  X  X  X road first X  X  and  X  X  X ink-dependent X  X  strategies require the least amount of cognitive effort on the part of participants. The  X  X  X road first X  X  strategy was one of the  X  X  X afe player X  X  strategies used by participants to remain within a familiar portion of the Web. Search terms were used for the maximum inclusion of relevant search results rather than specific terms that would exclude other possibilities. The  X  X  X ink-dependent X  X  strategy requires minimal cognitive effort from participants. The participants only have to decide which of the hyper-links presented on the webpage offers the best alternative. Similarly, the  X  X  X earch engine narrowing down X  X  strategy allows participants to rely on the search engine (or rather the search engine designers) to do the nar-rowing of the search domain rather than having to exert cognitive effort to think of appropriate query terms to narrow the search domain. Each of these strategies has a number of elements in common. Firstly, these strat-egies allow participants to rely on the design of search engines (e.g. search engine categories and search engine cataloguing) or websites (e.g. the identifiers that website designers use for their hyperlinks) to facilitate their information seeking. In contrast, participants with higher levels of Web experience used the specialised tools and functions of web browsers to facilitate their search (e.g. multiple browser windows,  X  X  X ind X  X  dialogue, and
Boolean logic operators). The  X  X  X eductive reasoning X  X  strategy was more difficult to justify as a  X  X  X ovice X  X  strat-egy. However, this strategy was only used thirteen times across the four tasks. This sample size was too small to draw any conclusive results, particularly at the level of individual tasks. The  X  X  X eductive reasoning X  X  strat-egy may have more to do with domain expertise than Web experience. 4.3. Researcher-defined and participant-defined tasks
Firstly it must be noted that the there were no significant differences on the choice of search task based on the chi-squared analysis. This might be explained by the relatively small sample size in relation to the number of possible cells in the contingency table. From the correspondence analyses, a clearer picture emerges. It is notable that the  X  X  X irtual tourist X  X  strategy and the  X  X  X nown address X  X  strategy do not appear in the two researcher-defined tasks. In the researcher-defined tasks, the higher levels of Web experience were closely related to the  X  X  X arallel player X  X ,  X  X  X arallel hub-and-spoke X  X  and  X  X  X nown address search domain X  X  as well as with the  X  X  X o-the-point X  X  strategy. The participants who used this strategy were attempting to complete the task as quickly as possible and were also likely to use Boolean logic operators to specify the search task and narrow the search domain as much as possible. The experienced participants used this strategy because they expected to find information quickly. The variety of strategies was wider in the two participant-defined tasks. The use of the  X  X  X equential player X  X  and the  X  X  X arallel player X  X  strategies by the higher Web experience levels in the participant-defined choice, general purpose task are a little more difficult to explain ( Fig. 5 ).
The  X  X  X equential player X  X  strategy was most closely associated with the lowest level of experience in the researcher-defined, general purpose task and with the other lower levels of Web experience in the two directed search tasks. A closer examination of Table 8 reveals that the correspondence analysis was probably represent-ing a chance relationship. Only six participants used the  X  X equential player X  strategy for the participant-defined, general purpose task and only one participant with a high level of Web experience used this strategy.
The sample size is too small to place any confidence in this correspondence analysis representation. The  X  X  X nown X  X  address strategy was only used in the participant-defined tasks but, unlike Ho  X  lscher and Strube (2000) , this strategy was not related to levels of Web experience. Given that participants were able to select their search tasks they would be more likely to choose a task in a familiar search domain where they would be more likely to know the Web address. 4.4. Directed search and general purpose browsing tasks
Based on the chi-squared tests, there were no significant differences in the choice of search strategy for the two directed search tasks and the two general purpose tasks. Lazonder et al. (2000) also found no significant differences based on Web experience for the directed search task. In the correspondence analysis, the overall search strategies were similar for the two general purpose tasks (i.e. both associated with the  X  X  X arallel hub-and-spoke X  X  and  X  X  X arallel player X  X  strategies for the highest levels of Web experience) except that in the researcher-defined task ( Fig. 3 ) the higher levels of experience were associated with the  X  X  X o-the-point X  X  strat-egy, rather than the  X  X  X nown address X  X  strategy, and in the participant-defined task ( Fig. 5 ) the higher levels of experience were also associated with the  X  X  X equential player X  X  strategy. Ho  X  lscher and Strube (2000) character-ised expert Web information seeking behaviour as frequent switching between browsing and querying, access-ing known websites directly, and using their  X  X  X avourite X  X  search engine. Ho  X  lscher and Strube X  X  (2000) results partially parallel the results from this study although importantly, do not include the use of multiple browser windows. Navarro-Prieto et al. (1999) found that Web experts used a mixed strategy (that included searching in multiple browser windows) for directed search tasks, but not for general purpose browsing tasks.
The two directed search tasks also produced some rather contradictory results. In the researcher-defined, directed search task, the highest level of Web experience was clearly distinguishable from the other levels of experience being associated with the  X  X  X nown address search domain X  X  and the  X  X  X earch engine player X  X  strat-egies ( Fig. 3 ). Given the fact that one would expect participants with a higher level of Web experience to gain some knowledge of the different capabilities and roles of different search engines, this association seems logical since a number of studies have provided evidence that search engines return different sets of results ( Lawrence &amp; Giles, 1998; Spink, Jansen, Blakely, &amp; Koshman, 2006 ) and that users with higher levels of experience choose search engines based on their characteristics and perceived precision ( Liaw &amp; Huang, 2006 ). One would then expect this strategy to be used across all the tasks by participants with a higher level of Web expe-rience. However, one finds exactly the opposite; the  X  X  X earch engine player X  X  strategy was only used by partic-ipants with lower levels of Web experience in three tasks. This probably confirms Spink et al. X  X  (2006) speculation that users have a poor understanding of the capabilities of search engines. 4.5. Limitations and directions for further research
The first set of limitations relate to the assessment of Web expertise. The measure developed in this study was specifically designed to incorporate aspects of depth and breadth of experience ( Fisher, 1991 ). However, by creating a composite score much of the complexity and variability of the Web experience variable may have been removed. Also, this measure still relies on self-reported experience. It is therefore quite likely that how one participant perceives a high level of experience is quite different from another participant X  X  perception of a high level of experience. The experience level is therefore an ordinal estimate rather than an objective measure.
Finally, there were only a few participants with very low levels of experience with the Web (i.e. only one par-ticipant who used the Web once a year and a further eight participants who used the Web a few times a month). This means that the lowest experience group ( N = 13) might not be representative of  X  X  X rue X  X  novices.
While a relatively consistent picture emerges across the four tasks it is also clear that the integrity of these results could be hampered by relatively small sample sizes for some of the strategies. These results were also difficult to interpret due to the small number of participants at the higher levels of Web experience. While the sample size of 80 is larger than any previous studies, the generalisability to the general Web user population is questionable and would require further investigation. Placing a time constraint of 15 min on the tasks might have had some influence on the choice of strategy, particularly in the general purpose browsing tasks. Slone (2007) found that most tasks that people carry out online were short (less than 30 min) although some brows-ing tasks took longer than 30 min.

One possible direction for future investigation is to determine whether training people to use the strategies adopted by the most experienced Web users would lead to improved search performance. Lucas and Topi (2004) noted that users were able to significantly improve their search performance with a limited amount of training in Boolean logic operators. 5. Conclusions
Only two significant performance differences were found across all four tasks on a number of performance measures between different levels of Web experience. Both of these differences were in researcher-defined tasks.
Across the four tasks participants with more Web experience were more likely to use  X  X  X arallel player X  X  and  X  X  X arallel hub-and-spoke X  X  strategies and to a lesser extent, the  X  X  X nown address search domain X  X  and  X  X  X nown address X  X  strategies. In contrast, those participants with lower levels of Web experience were more likely to use strategies that involved less cognitive effort such as the  X  X  X irtual tourist X  X ,  X  X  X ink-dependent X  X ,  X  X  X o-the-point X  X ,  X  X  X equential player X  X ,  X  X  X earch engine narrowing X  X , and  X  X  X road first X  X  strategies. When the cognitive search strategies are examined in each task, the distribution of search strategies by level of expertise was non-signif-icant, although the patterns of search strategy choice by level of experience were similar. The differences in cognitive search strategy choices for different levels of experience between researcher-defined and partici-pant-defined tasks were partially supported by the performance data as the only significant performance mea-sures were for researcher-defined tasks. Since previous studies have only used researcher-defined tasks (and many of these studies report significant differences in performance measures based on Web experience) this would suggest that researcher-defined tasks may be producing different patterns of searching behaviour to most real-life searching tasks.

 Appendix. Examples of each of the cognitive search strategies Safe player  X  X  X road first X  X  : A participant using this strategy would access their favourite search engine (e.g.
Google). They would start their search by first using broad terms (e.g.  X  X  X auses of desertification X  X ) and would then follow short paths from the search engine results in a hub-and-spoke pattern. They would use more spe-cific terms if the broad terms were unsuccessful (e.g.  X  X  X arbon monoxide causes desertification X  X ).
Safe player  X  X  X earch engine narrowing down X  X  : A participant using this strategy would choose a specific search engine based on the perception that the choice of search engine would narrow down the search domain (e.g. choosing a South African search engine for a South African search task). They would then probably use broad terms and follow short hub-and-spoke patterns from the search results.

Safe player  X  X  X earch engine player X  X  : In this strategy a participant would use a number of different search engines based on their perceived qualities/abilities to access different parts of the Web (e.g. Google Scholar for academic information and Yahoo for more general information on the same search task). They would then use broad terms and follow short hub-and-spoke patterns from the search results.

Safe player  X  X  X nown address search domain X  X  : A participant might choose to go directly to the White House homepage if looking for information on past president Clinton. They would then follow a hub-and-spoke type pattern from this homepage.  X  X  X arallel player X  X  : A participant would open up multiple browser windows and would attempt slightly dif-ferent approaches in each browser window (e.g.  X  X  X ill Clinton X  X  in one browser window and  X  X  http:// www.whitehouse.gov  X  X  in another browser window). They would then switch between browser windows to check progress and to move each search forward.  X  X  X ink-dependent X  X  : A participant might click on the link to the Geography department (to search for answers to causes of desertification) or the Chemistry department (to search for information on carbon mon-oxide) from the starting homepage of the task.
  X  X  X o-the-point X  X  : A participant using this strategy would access their favourite search engine (e.g. AskJeeves).
They would then use very specific terms to narrow down the search (e.g.  X  X  X hat is Bill Clinton X  X  mother X  X  mai-den name? X  X ). If this was unsuccessful they would use broader terms (e.g.  X  X  X nformation on Bill Clinton X  X ).  X  X  X nown address X  X  : A participant goes directly to the Cricinfo website and clicks on  X  X  X atest scorecards X  X  in order to get the latest scores for a current cricket test match. The website and where to find information in the website is known.  X  X  X equential player X  X  : In this strategy a participant goes straight from general terms (e.g.  X  X  X ill Clinton X  X ) to exact phrases (e.g.  X  X  X ill Clinton mother maiden name X  X ) without a gradual broadening of terms.  X  X  X eductive reasoning X  X  : A participant using this strategy would use terms apparently unrelated to the search question. For example, in the desertification and carbon monoxide task one participant searched for  X  X  X iolog-ical warfare X  X  as they believed that desertification involved deserting the armed forces and that carbon mon-oxide was a biological warfare agent.  X  X  X irtual tourist X  X  : A participant using this strategy would follow a predetermined set of links. For example, one participant, when completing the carbon monoxide and desertification task, searched an environmental website. They would start to follow the links within the website in a systematic fashion starting at the top left link (e.g.  X  X  X acts about our environment X  X , then  X  X  X lobal environment monitoring X  X , etc.) and examining the web-site methodically until all links had been followed.  X  X  X arallel hub-and-spoke X  X  : Instead of returning to the results pages of a search engine, a participant would open up each search result in a new browser window (i.e. in searching using the terms  X  X  X ill Clinton X  X , links such as  X  X  X iography of William J. Clinton X  X  and  X  X  X he  X  X nofficial X  Bill Clinton X  X  would be opened in new brow-ser windows). If the result was promising they would keep that browser window open and search further in the original browser window.
