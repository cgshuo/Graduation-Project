 Many biology databases such as PubMED, Genbank, SWISS-PROT, and InterPro provide various kinds of data: proteins, genes, gene sequences, research articles, and others. This data is being used as a useful knowledge resource for subsequent re-search. To utilize biological databases and the knowledge they contain, methods to integrate and analyze different kinds of information are needed. Research based on text data is especially necessary. In text-based genome research, information extrac-methods. 
Proteins play important roles in biological phenomena and many cellular proc-teins is one of the most important issues in the post-genomic era. For the discovery of new proteins by genome research, many methods for protein function annotation are presented. The reliable method of function annotation is a manual approach. Biologi-cal experts search the functional information of a protein from several databases and consuming. Most systematic approaches use the homologies of protein sequence, structures, or protein-protein interactions. 
In this paper we present a protein function classification method for the function prediction of human proteins. Our method is for proteins in biological texts. We ex-periment with human proteins assigned to the GO molecular function terms. 2.1 Protein Annotation and Function Classification Proteins are one of the important elements for revealing the secrets of various biologi-cal phenomena. Protein functions are considered to be one of the basic factors in bio-logical research. The first approach to determining protein function used sequence assignment [1, 11]. By sequence comparison, proteins with similar gene sequences are classified into a similar function category. This method uses sequence assignment tools such as Blast and Blast-T. Another approach is using the structural homologues of proteins [4]. There are also approaches using protein-protein inte ractions. Proteins 5, 10]. 
Many techniques with supervised learning algorithms have shown reasonable per-formance in text classification. C.Z. Cai used a support vector machine for the classi-each protein sequence, feature vectors were assembled from encoded representations of tabulated residue properties. Hans-Peter introduced the FUNCLASS system, which uses a nearest neighbor algorithm to classify unknown proteins [7]. The system was designed to use the SWISS-PROT databank. The classification algorithm requires a BLAST output as input. The common approach to classifying protein functions is to teins classified by experts. 2.2 Gene Ontology Ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization. The GO consortium uses ontology to describe the attributes of gene products in three domains of molecular and cellular biology [3]. The three domains do not overlap each other and each domain describes biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions in a species-independent manner. GO molecular function terms describe the activities of gene products and form a hierarchy. GO molecular function terms support  X  X s-a X  and  X  X art-of X  relationships. 
According to the functions of proteins, proteins are assigned to GO molecular function terms by GO curators or systematic approaches [3, 4]. Most proteins have one function. But, some proteins have more than one function. Assignment of proteins to GO molecular function terms can be used to predict the functions of proteins [8, 9]. 3.1 Protein and Features Protein is one of the most important elements for explaining biological phenomena that occur in organisms. A protein acts alone or interacts with other proteins, and most proteins have biological roles in organisms. The relations among proteins and the molecular functions. To extract proper information related to the proteins of organ-isms, it is important to know which functions proteins have. In text-based research, terms are used as important features in handling documents. Biological texts show us the many research results such as sequence, protein struc-tures, protein-protein interactions, and others. Keywords extracted from those bio-logical texts are used as important features in obtaining useful information [6]. Gener-ally, a protein name consists of several terms. Terms in protein names represent amino acids, biological processes, tissues, cells, or diseases. We use terms in protein names as features for protein function classification. 3.2 Feature Extraction Term features of human proteins are extracted by following two steps. The first step of feature extraction is tokenizing. In this step, a protein name is divided into several words and candidates of term features are selected from among those. Some adjacent words are separated by delimiters, but they should be treated as single terms repre-senting specific meanings. For instance, the protein  X  X -cell lymphoma 6 protein X  is tokenized as follows: { X  X  X ,  X  X ell X ,  X  X ymphoma X ,  X 6 X ,  X  X rotein X  X .  X  X -cell X  is a cell in the human body. To detect candidates of term features from adjacent words, we use a knowledge-base and apply the local alignment method for sequence comparison. Important terms of cellular components and diseases are established as a knowledge-base. The second step is filtering. In protein names, there are important terms which can be used as features and non-informative terms which include numerals and stop-words. We filter the non-informative terms. Even though numerals are used to indi-vectors. classes on the basis of the functions of the protein. A protein X  X  functions are predicted by the classification method derived from the learning method. 4.1 Feature Weight Most protein names are composed of several term features. Each feature has a differ-ent weight in the function prediction of proteins. The functional characteristics of each feature are derived from the functions of the protein. The function probability of tracted from function-known proteins. The functional probability of each feature is affected by occurrence in the function classes and by the number of function classes including the feature. The feature with a high frequency in a particular function class has a higher functional probability than in other function classes. The functional im-number of function classes including that feature. Functional importance is inversely proportioned to the total frequency of the feature and the number of function classes. inverse of class frequency; then, the weight of feature f i in C k is the following. 
Not all function classes include all features. Some features do not belong to some function classes. According to Eq uation (1), if a feature X  X  occurrence is zero in a func-tion class, the probability of that feature is zero. This shows that the feature cannot be used to represent the function. However, according to the data sparseness problem, than 1 to each function class and modify the probability of the feature in the function feature. The  X  k is a small value that is determined by the total frequency of the feature and the class frequency. The following equation calculates the smoothing value  X  k . 
As can be seen in Equation (2), the smoothing value  X  k is calculated by the inverse C is always greater than 0 and is equal to or less than 1. Each feature is assigned a value between 0 and 1 as a function probability. The weight of each feature is calculated by Equation (3). Using the function probability, each feature X  X  weight for the function class is adjusted to the classification model. 4.2 Similarity Measure To determine the functions of proteins, we use a mixture model derived from infor-mation theory and the na X ve Bayesian method with feature collocation. We assume tures. Each feature has an affect on the determination of protein functions. A protein is described as a set of feature weights. Th e similarity of a protei n and a function class is measured by information theory and the na X ve Bayesian method. We multiply the with collocation. 5.1 Experimental Data The European Bioinformatics Institute (E.B.I.) provides assignments of gene products to the Gene Ontology resource. A controlled vocabulary is being applied to a non-redundant set of proteins described in the EBI X  X  core genome and proteome databases. based on the GO molecular function. For the experiment, labeled data are divided into second group is a testing dataset. The performance of our approach is estimated using estimation. 5.2 Experimental Results We compared the results of our approach with those of the Na X ve Bayesian approach and Information Theory. Table 1 shows the experimental results of the function clas-Na X ve Bayesian approach and Information Theory, our method is superior in the case of the test data. There was 3.22% and 2.17% of improvement in the test data. GO molecular function classes. Similarity is measured by the mixed model (informa-tion theory and na X ve Bayesian method) with feature collocation. The mixed model shows better performance than either Information Theory or the na X ve Bayesian molecular function terms. Classifying proteins the lower-level function classes will provide more reliable function classification. By combining lower-level function classes into upper-level function classes, the performance accuracy can be improved. M10400000279-05J0000-27910 of Korea Science and Engineering Foundation.
