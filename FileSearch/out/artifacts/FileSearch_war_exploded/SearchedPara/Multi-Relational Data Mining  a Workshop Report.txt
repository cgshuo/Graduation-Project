 In this report, we briefly review the Multi-Relational Data Mining workshop, which was held in Edmonton, Canada on July, 23, 2002 as part of the workshop program of the 8th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-02). An increasing number of data mining applications involve the analysis of complex and structured types of data (such as sequences in genome analysis, HTML and XML documents) and require the use of expressive pattern languages. Many of these applications cannot be solved using traditional data mining algorithms. This observation forms the main mo-tivation for the multi-disciplinary field of Multi-Relational Data Mining (MRDM). The solution proposed by MRDM consists of dealing with data in the form of multiple tables in a relational database. Mining data that represent com-plex/structured objects also falls within the scope of this field, since the normalized representation of such objects in a relational database requires the use of multiple tables. The field of MRDM aims at integrating results from existing fields such as inductive logic programming, KDD, machine learning and relational databases; producing new techniques for mining multi-relational data; and practical applications of such techniques. Typical data mining approaches look for patterns in a single relation of a database. For many applications, squeezing data from multiple relations into a single table requires much thought and effort and can lead to loss of information. An alternative for these applications is to use multi-relational data mining. Multi-relational data mining can analyze data from a multi-relation database di-rectly, without the need to transfer the data into a single table first. Thus the relations mined can reside in a rela-tional or deductive database. Using multi-relational data mining it is often also possible to take into account back-ground knowledge, which can be regarded as views in the database.
 Present MRDM approaches consider all of the main data mining tasks, including association analysis, classification, clustering, learning probabilistic models and regression. The pattern languages used by single-table data mining approaches for these data mining tasks have been extended to the multiple-SIGKDD Explorations. Volume 4, Issue 2 -page 122 One of the central ideas in this work concerns the use of a canonical representation for graphs. Using a canonical form, the data mining algorithms can avoid generating identical patterns or graphs more than once.
 Constraint-Based Mining of Sequences in SeqLog (S.D. Lee and L. De Raedt) addresses the mining of logical sequences within the inductive logic programming tradition. Logi-cal sequences are sequences of logical atoms, such as la-tex(kdd,tex), xdvi(kdd), dvips(kdd,dvi) . The MineSeqLog al-gorithm is able to retrieve patterns of interest under a con-junction of anti-monotone and monotone constraints (e.g., a minimum frequency on the positives, and a maximum one on the negatives).
 A final contribution related to this topic Discovering Knowl-edge from Relational Data Extracted from Business News (A. Bernstein, S. Clearwater, S. Hill, C. Perlich and F. Provost) was concerned with constructing graphs that sum-marize information about companies starting from newspa-per articles. In contrast with the previous contributions, this work was not concerned with analyzing graph data, but rather with inferring knowledge in the form of graphs. In-deed, knowledge about companies is discovered from large corpora of newspaper articles. The authors clearly demon-strate that the extracted knowledge is useful for a wide range of tasks. An important stream within contemporary multi-relational data mining and inductive logic programming addresses the issue of combining relational (or first order) representations with probabilistic approaches.
 The contribution Schemas and Models (D. Jensen and J. Neville) reviews various existing approaches to learning prob-abilistic relational representations and characterizes them in the Schema-Model framework. The framework identifies two key components: 1) a schema, which can be viewed as the underlying database schema of the representation, and 2) a model, which defines the probabilistic nature of the representation. After introducing the Schema-Model, the authors discuss how it is instantiated in specific probabilis-tic relational representations and use this to discuss future directions.
 Statistical Models for Relational Data (L. Getoor, D. Koller, and B. Taskar) introduces a novel probabilistic relational representation, called SRM (Statistical Relational Model). An SRM is a statistical model of a particular database in-stantiation. It summarizes information about the frequen-cies of tuples as well as join operations. As such, SRMs can be employed for query approximation. The authors first in-troduce the semantics of SRMs, then discuss algorithms for estimating their parameters and learning their structure. Traditionally, multi-relational data mining has investigated how well-known data mining algorithms, such as decision tree learners, can be upgraded towards the use of multi-relational representations.
 Experiments With MRDTL  X  A Multi-Relational Decision Tree Learning Algorithm (H. Leiva and V. Honavar) presents the multi-relational decision tree learner MRDTL and ap-plies it to several benchmark data sets such as the KDD Cup 2001 data. MRDTL exploits SQL to learn directly from data in a relational database.
 SIGKDD Explorations. Volume 4, Issue 2 -page 123 The applications addressed involved text and web mining, link analysis and evidence extraction, as well as bio-and chemo-informatics. The representations and underlying methodologies followed included those of relational learn-ing, inductive logic programming, entity-relationship model, graph-and sequence based mining.
 In addition to these scientific aspects, there was also an im-portant new social aspect: it was the first time that a work-shop on multi-relational data mining or inductive logic pro-gramming counted more American attendees than European and Japanese ones.
 Finally, the authors hope that the interest in MRDM will continue and also, that the richness and diversity in ap-proaches will remain as one of its distinguishing features. Therefore, the authors plan to organise further workshops on this topic as well as a special issue of the SIGKDD Ex-plorations (to appear in 2003) on this topic.
