 structure and motion problem of multiview geometry. This problem, that have received a great deal of attention by the computer vision community in last decade, consists in recovering a set of 3D points (structure) and a set of camera matrices (motion), when only 2D images of the aforemen-tioned 3D points by some cameras are available. Throughout this work we assume that the internal points. We will assume in the present study that these point correspondences have been already established.
 arguments.
 A natural approach to cope with such situations consists in searching for the input providing the output space. A standard approach [16] consists in measuring the distance between two elements Figure 1: (a) One image from the dinosaur sequence. Camera locations and scene points estimated by the blind L  X  -cost minimization (b,c) and by the proposed  X  X utlier aware X  procedure (d,e). two cameras, this leads to a hard non-convex optimization problem. A particularly elegant way of L  X  -norm [15, 18, 24, 25, 27, 13, 26]. It has been shown that, for a number of problems, L  X  -norm affected by the outliers in the data. Two procedures have been introduced [27, 19] that make the L produced estimates.
 The purpose of the present work is to introduce and to theoretically investigate a new procedure of estimation in presence of noise and outliers. Our procedure combines L  X  -norm for measuring 2, 5, 6].
 numerical experiments. The methodology of our study is summarized in Section 7. Let us start by presenting a problem of multiview geometry to which our approach can be success-references therein.
 U j by some cameras P R we are interested in estimating  X   X  .
 P e of  X   X  are given below. x were the true parameter. It can also be written as solution and the existing iterative algorithms may often get stuck in local minima. An ingenious idea to overcome this difficulty [15, 17] is based on the minimization of the L  X  cost function bisection algorithm can be summarized as follows. We aim to designate an algorithm computing b  X  Although (5) is not a convex problem, its solution can be well approximated by solving a sequence of convex feasibility problems. unknown parameters of the model that leads to a MAP estimator. 4.1 The statistical model cover the situation where some outliers are present in the measurements, we introduce the vector  X   X   X  R N defined by  X   X  |  X  p | &gt; 0 otherwise. This leads us to the model: where diag( v ) stands for the diagonal matrix having the components of v as diagonal entries. Statement of the problem: Given the matrices A and C , estimate the parameter-vector  X   X  = [  X   X  T ;  X   X  T ] T based on the following prior information: 4.2 Sparsity prior and MAP estimator the unknown vector  X  .
 it is reasonable to assume that the components of  X  are uniformly distributed in some compact set of measurements using the empirical covariance matrix [20]. We define the prior on  X  as the uniform prior, which is however not a problem for defining the Bayes estimator.
 Theorem 1. Assume that the noise  X  has independent entries which are uniformly distributed in [  X   X , X  ] for some  X  &gt; 0 , then the MAP estimator b  X  = [ b  X  T ; (8) is the solution of the optimization problem: The proof of this theorem is a simple exercise and is left to the reader.
 (9) and  X   X  would have a smaller L 1 -norm than that of b  X  solves (9).
 4.3 Two-step procedure Building on the previous arguments, we introduce the following two-step algorithm. C J by zero. Furthermore, let us define One easily checks that  X  J  X  [0 , 1] and  X  J  X   X  J 0 if J  X  J 0 .
 conditions as well. As a consequence, the true vector cannot be accurately estimated. 5.1 The noise free case b  X  of  X   X  is then defined as a solution to the optimization problem an index set T and zero elsewhere. The complementary set of T will be denoted by T c . to the locations of S largest entries 4 of  X   X  (resp. (  X   X   X  for some constant C 0 , it holds: has no more than S nonzero entries, then the estimation is exact: b  X  =  X   X  .
 Proof. We set h =  X   X   X  with the proof, we need the following auxiliary result, the proof of which can be easily deduced from [4].
 Lemma 1. Let v  X  R d be some vector and let S  X  d be a positive integer. If we denote by T the indices of S largest entries of the vector | v | , then k v T c k 2  X  S  X  1 / 2 k v k 1 .
Applying Lemma 1 to the vector v = h T c On the other hand, summing up the inequalities k h T c k (  X   X   X  h ) T k b  X  k 1 , we get k b  X  k 1  X k  X   X  k 1 . This inequality, in conjunction with (13) and (14), implies where the last step follows from the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. Using once again the fact that both b  X  and  X   X  satisfy the constraints of (11), we get h = A T g . Therefore, To complete the proof, it suffices to observe that that of Theorem 2 hold under other kind of assumptions recently introduced in the theory of L 1 -minimization [11, 29, 2]. This investigation is left for future research.
 then max( k 5.2 The noisy case The assumption  X  = 0 is an idealization of the reality that has the advantage of simplifying the mathematical derivations. While such a simplified setting is useful for conveying the main ideas A b  X  = Theorem 3. Let the assumptions of Theorem 2 be fulfilled. If for some &gt; 0 we have max( k diag( C T b  X  ) b  X  k 2 ; k diag( C T  X   X  )  X  k 2 )  X  , then where C 0 and C 1 are some constants.
 Proof. Let us define  X  = diag( C T  X   X  )  X  and we have k h ( T h = A T g + To complete the proof, it suffices to remark that 5.3 Discussion then it is possible to find  X  0  X   X  P such that A T T c estimation ill-posed, since both  X   X  and  X  0 satisfy (7) with the same number of outliers. presence of S outliers, while max J : | J | X  S  X  S (  X   X  ) &lt; 1 is necessary. k O J , the computation of k O T J k is far easier than that of  X  J (  X  ) .

 tion. We implemented the algorithm in MatLab, using the SeDuMi package for solving LPs [28].

 referred to as SH-procedure, and by Kanade and Ke [19], hereafter KK-procedure. For the SH-procedure, we iteratively computed the L  X  -cost minimizer by removing, at each step j , the mea-surements that had a RE larger than E max,j  X  0 . 5 , where E max,j was the largest RE. We have stopped the SH-procedure when the number of removed measurements exceeded 1,500. This num-ber has been attained after 53 cycles. Therefore, the execution time was approximately 50 times larger than for our procedure. The estimator obtained by SH-procedure has a maximal RE equal procedure, we run it with the parameter value m = N  X  N O = 15 , 000 , which is approximately the number of inliers detected by our method. Recall that the KK-procedure aims at minimizing the m th largest RE. As shown in Fig. 2, our procedure performs better than that of [19]. In this paper, we presented a rigorous Bayesian framework for the problem of translation estima-tion and triangulation that have leaded to a new robust estimation procedure. We have formulated the problem under consideration as a nonlinear inverse problem with a high-dimensional unknown parameter-vector. This parameter-vector encapsulates the information on the scene points and the mator under mild assumptions. Real data analysis conducted on the dinosaur sequence supports our theoretical results.
