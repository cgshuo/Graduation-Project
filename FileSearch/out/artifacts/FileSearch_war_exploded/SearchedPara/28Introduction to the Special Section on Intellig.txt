 With the Web boom in recent years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in novel applications of Intelligent Tutoring and Coaching Systems (IT&amp;CS), covering a wide range of traditional as well as new computer-aided instruction paradigms such as e-learning and distributed learning. The rapid development of Web-based learning and new concepts like virtual classrooms, virtual laboratories, and virtual universities introduces many new issues to be addressed. On the technical side, we need to develop effective AI-driven technology to support IT&amp;CS, including natural language process-ing, knowledge-based systems, machine learning, planning, multiagent systems and ontology. On the teaching and management side, we need to consider issues such as a new style of tutoring and different system set-up requirements. This special section was developed in response to some of these needs. From thirteen submissions, we have selected three articles for this special section based on the quality of these papers.
The first article,  X  X ractable POMDP Representations for Intelligent Tutoring Sys-tems, X  is by Folsom-Kovarik, Sukthankar, and Schatz (of Soar Technology, University of Central Florida, and the LLC  X  A DSCI Company, respectively). It addresses the tractability issue of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) in ITSs, which is known for its poor scalability with na  X   X ve problem representations. Two POMDP representations, namely, state queues and observation chains, are presented in this article, which let POMDPs scale to represent large problem size as in practical ITSs (e.g., more than 100 independent learner features) but still stay small enough to find an effective policy. They use a real-world military training problem as an example, and the user study with 14 trainees as subjects shows these representations can model a wide range of simulated problems with instructional efficacy equal to lossless representations.
 The second article,  X  X ONET: An Interactive Search Network for Intelligent Lecture Path Generation, X  is by Yen, Shih and Jin (Yen and of Jin Waseda University, Japan and Shih National Central University, Taiwan). It discusses the reuse issue of learning objects (LOs). They propose the Learning Object Network (LONET) based on the con-cepts from social networking, which is an extension of the Reusability Tree. In LONET, the commonly used links among LOs are highlighted with extra weights. They also propose two algorithms to generate candidate paths using the prerequisite relation among LOs and the attributes of the LOs. The generated paths are stored back in the repository for further reference and reuse. Although their empirical study shows its high reusability, they also point out some of its limitations, including the requirement of precise metadata.

The third article,  X  X ersonalized Reading Support for Second-Language Web Docu-ments, X  is by Ehara, Shimizu, Ninomiya and Nakagawa (Ehara, Shimizu, and Naka-gawa of The University of Tokyo and Ninomiya Ehime University, Japan). It presents a novel intelligent interface which automatically predicts those words unknown to a particular user and provides the corresponding meanings of these words in a glossing manner when the user browses a Web document written in an unfamiliar language. The user does not need to manually click on those unfamiliar words to get their mean-ings and therefore can save some time and read more fluently. Experimental evaluation shows that it dramatically reduces both the number of unknown words unpredicted and the number of clicks necessary for individual users to understand the documents. The personalized prediction of unknown words is based on successful estimation of both the difficulty of the words and each particular user X  X  language ability by an extended version of item response theory (IRT) applied on accumulated use logs.

While these three articles address various technical aspects related to IT&amp;CS, the coverage is by no means complete, and there are still other open issues closely associ-ated with tutoring and coaching in learning environments that are not addressed in this special section. There is no doubt that IT&amp;CS is a fast developing and ongoing field of research which will attract more initiatives and efforts from the academic and industrial sectors.

We would like to thank those individuals who have helped make this special section possible. Most important of all, we would like to thank Professor Qiang Yang, the Editor-in-Chief of ACM TIST, for his strong support of this special section and for his careful reading and constructive comments on the accepted articles. We would also like to thank the authors who submitted manuscripts for consideration and the many dedicated, anonymous reviewers who helped us arrive at our final decision.
