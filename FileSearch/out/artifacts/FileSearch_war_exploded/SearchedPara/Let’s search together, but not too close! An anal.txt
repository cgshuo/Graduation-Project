 1. Introduction complexity of information and communication flows often exceed the processing capacities of individuals ( Yuan, Fulk, &amp; Monge, 2007 ), which require individuals to work together to collect, analyze, and synthesize information.
Some studies have already examined social practices that affect collaboration during the information seeking process. For dination, and awareness as core processes of collaborative work ( Shah, 2010b ). In addition, other studies have revealed nents of collaborative Web search. However, these studies have not considered potential costs and benefits of communica-tion processes in CIS. In contrast, the first goal of this work is to explore the communication processes of teams in CIS.  X 
A common finding in communication research is that physical proximity facilitates communication by increasing spon-taneous interactions. Although the literature has shown that communication can facilitate greater exchange of high-quality information, research has also demonstrated negative effects of social interaction on problem solving, generation of ideas, frequency negatively influences team creativity. Along with these lines, the second goal of this work is to compare the CIS the theoretical framework of computer-mediated communication (CMC). Specifically, we investigate how communication contexts constrain or improve communication processes and the outcomes in CIS.

Social and collaborative aspects of information retrieval/seeking are essential for designing better information retrieval (IR) and human X  X omputer interaction (HCI) systems. Early studies showed that communication is necessary for system designers of collaborative solutions to understand the costs and benefits related to communication choices under various circumstances ( Grudin, 1994 ). Besides communication needs, introducing support for collaborative search as well as munication contexts that could help to design better systems.

To meet our goals, we conducted an experiment with 60 participants in 30 pairs. Each pair was randomly assigned to three different experimental conditions (collocated, text chat, and text plus audio chat) defined based on spatial context and communication support. The following section provides background for this work, along with specific gaps in our under-
Finally, the paper concludes with reflections on the results, as well as implications for CIS system design. 2. Background and research questions
Several studies have investigated the effect of communication context on the performance of collaborative teams. Within the framework of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), studies have examined the effect of CMC ( Fidas, Komis, none of these studies have focused on the communication processes of teams in information seeking tasks across different contexts, which may have an impact on the performance of collaborative teams. This section presents a review of relevant are introduced. 2.1. Collaborative information seeking
CIS is commonly characterized by the  X  X  X ystems and practices that enable individuals to collaborate during the seeking, for designing better systems that can support collaboration in searching, assessing, and making sense of information.
As a key concept in CIS, collaboration has been studied from different perspectives in information studies. As a result, multiple definitions have been developed for this term. In this paper, we define collaboration as a social process in which two or more individuals intentionally and explicitly work together with the aim of cooperating to accomplish common goals, either synchronously or asynchronously, co-located or remotely located, using communication to interact with as well as to coordinate actions among group members. 2.2. Social processes in collaborative information seeking During recent years, many studies have explored different aspects of CIS in both naturalistic and experimental settings. The focus has typically been on describing users X  behaviors as well as information seeking processes of teams. For example, Hyldegard (2006, 2009) studied the applicability of Kuhlthau X  X  (1991) information search process in the context of groups.
Similarly, Shah and Gonz X lez-Ib X  X ez (2011) attempted to map the stages in Kuhlthau X  X  model to collaborative information seeking. Both studies revealed that even though some stages of this model may apply to CIS, they do not cover the social dimension of CIS.
 In an organizational context, Morris and Horvitz X  X  study (2007) revealed three key features for supporting collaborative reported employing various methods for managing collaborative search tasks in order to increase efficiency. Such methods included explicitly dividing up the space of potential keywords, search engines, or subtasks, and assigning a part to each group member. In terms of communication media used, instant messaging was mostly used for discussion about the task and division of labor and facilitating awareness. Associating audio feedback while sharing information was suggested as an alternative way for notifying users about each other X  X  activities.

In a follow-up study, Morris (2008) investigated the effects of distance on the collaborative search process. Participants working on a collaborative Web search indicated both obstacles and advantages of working remotely. On one hand, working creativity in gathering information. On the other hand, while working remotely they faced the problem of gathering redun-awareness between collaborators and made the exchange of detailed information difficult. These findings demonstrate the need for varying degrees of communication and coordination during search process for awareness, creativity, communica-tion and thereby positive outcomes. As such, the following section reviews the theoretical frameworks that help us better understand the relationship between the level of interaction a task needs and the type of communication medium used to fulfill these needs. 2.3. Communication needs and media use
Several theories of CMC suggest a fit between the communication needs of a task and the capacity of a communication munication is considered as the richest medium in that people can rapidly convey content and meaning both verbally and nonverbally. Audio communication allows conveyance of certain nonverbal information, and text chat communication only ence and people tend to choose media compatible with their needs for social presence. Research indicates that F2F commu-nication is the highest in social presence followed by video, multichannel audio, speakerphone, and written text ( Shaw, oration call for richer medium and higher levels of social presence.

As the literature above suggests collaborators need varying degrees of interaction throughout a CIS task, and therefore should be matched with a particular communication media. For instance, while division of labor is a decision making process
Along with the premises of media richness and social presence theories, each task needs to be supported by a different com-munication medium. As such, our first research question aims to explore the varying interaction needs throughout a CIS task and to identify the optimum communication medium to be used to fulfill these interaction needs in order to develop systems that support those interactions ( Table 1 ).

Prior research also demonstrated that a lack of fit between the medium and a task X  X  social need can negatively influence the performance of communication partners ( Mennecke, Valacich, &amp; Wheeler, 2000 ). For instance, communicating through audio is found to be important when collaborating at a distance and to improve both task performance and perceived affor-ration, we excluded video chat from our current study and only focused on F2F, text-based, and audio communication. ond research question addresses the relation between communication contexts and their implications in the performance of teams ( Table 1 ). 2.4. Cognitive and affective factors in communication
Communication context may also influence the cognitive and affective loads of team members. Cognitive load refers to the limitations on working memory capacity ( Howarth &amp; Anderson, 2007 ). As pointed out by Howarth and Anderson, in a collaborative problem-solving task, cognitive load, and communication context influence the way team members collaborate with one another. This study found that team members in a video-mediated context used fewer question-form introductions naires, Satar and  X zdener (2008) found in an experimental study that participants using text-based communication experi-ence a decrease of anxiety levels when compared to those that used voice communication. Considering these two aspects, we also wish to address the relationship between communication and cognitive and affective load through our third research question ( Table 1 ). 3. Method 3.1. Participants
We conducted a laboratory study involving a total of 60 participants in 30 collaborative pairs. We chose the minimum group size in this study to avoid the incorporation of new and potential intervening variables. Early studies showed that as the number of collaborators working together increases, the complexity of possible interactions increases exponentially, communication practices and performance.

Participants were recruited from Rutgers University by sending experiment advertisements to email lists and posting announcements around campus. Participants were asked to sign up in pairs with someone with whom they had previous experience collaborating. This was to make sure that the participants were comfortable working with their teammates and to ensure common ground ( Clark &amp; Brennan, 1991 ). Participants were informed of compensation for participating in the study, which consisted of $10 per person and the possibility to obtain additional prizes if they were among the three best-performing teams ($50, $25, and $15 per person additionally) at the end of the study. 3.2. System
In order to provide appropriate tools and support for information seeking processes of the participants working in var-ious collaborative conditions, we developed a modified version of Coagmento ( Gonz X lez-Ib X  X ez &amp; Shah, 2011; Shah, had the following buttons: (1) Home  X  for taking the participant to appropriate questionnaires, (2) Bookmark  X  for book-marking a webpage, (3) Snip  X  for collecting a snippet using highlighted text from a webpage, and (4) Editor  X  for access-ing a shared editor for writing the report. The sidebar had two major components: a chat-box and a resources panel. The chat-box allowed the collaborators in a given team to communicate with each other and also to receive instructions from the researcher conducting the study. The resources panel included tabs for bookmarks, saved snippets, and executed que-ries. See Fig. 1 for details.
 3.3. Session workflow
Each experimental session lasted less than an hour and was structured in six parts, which are described below: 1. Participants were introduced to the study and asked to sign a consent form. 2. Participants watched a brief tutorial in order to learn the basic functionalities required during the task. 3. Participants individually filled out pre-task questionnaires (demographics and PANAS). 4. Participants read the task description (given later). 5. Each team worked for 25 min on the given task, which included searching and collecting relevant information, and 6. Participants filled out post-task questionnaires. The researcher conducting the study communicated with the partic-keep the experiment manageable for both the researchers and the participants. Setting such a limit is a common practice for much time as they like would yield different results, but that is a subject of investigation for a future study. 3.4. Conditions
To investigate how communication relates to various aspects of group work while working in collaboration for an infor-mation seeking task, we conducted experiments with three different conditions: two participants at the same room with dif-cate via audio and text-based chat (C3 audio+text ). Note that participants in conditions C2 communication channel they had were the ones provided in each condition. 3.5. Task
The participants were asked to collect relevant information for an exploratory search task that was designed to be a relevant at the time this study was being conducted (early fall 2010). Our preliminary investigations, including several pilot runs, indicated that there was a substantial amount of material on this topic, and that the participants would find it interesting and challenging enough as an exploratory search task. Each participant was given the following task description:  X  X  A leading newspaper has hired your team to create a comprehensive report on the causes, effects, and consequences of the ple and animals) in the gulf, attempts to fix the leaking well and to clean the waters, long-term implications and lessons learned.  X  X 
The participants saw this description on the screen and were also given a printed copy to refer to during their session. 3.6. Protocol for data capturing
During the lab session, we captured various forms of data from the users X  physical actions, such as visited pages, book-these multimedia sources were synchronized with an error margin of a few seconds. In the case of C1 also recorded audio of their conversations during the session. 4. Data analysis
In order to study the communication within teams, we devised a specific method that consisted of four stages: (1) pre-processing, (2) coding, (3) post-processing, and (4) evaluation.
 4.1. Data pre-processing
Prior to conducting our analyses, we prepared the data obtained from each experimental session. From the 30 teams that participated in our study, we ended up with more than 25 h of audiovisual data and thousands of records of participants X  actions in our system. From this data, we conducted a preprocessing procedure in order to segment and synchronize our data sources. The segmentation was performed in order to identify the moment in which each participant completed the last pre-task questionnaire and the moment right before they started filling in the first post-task questionnaire. We then synchro-nized the sources of data for each pair of participants within a team in order to identify properly when both participants reached the task description stage. After performing segmentation, we extracted the audio and text messages containing the communication of each team in conditions C1 f2f and C3 sages from our chat logs. At the end of this stage, we possessed approximately 9.5 h of audio for C1 text messages for C2 text . 4.2. Content analysis
Content analysis of communication was used to investigate communication patterns during intragroup collaboration. We used both a qualitative and a quantitative approach, such that communication between team members were coded, and then frequencies used for statistical comparisons. We used a sentence or part of a compound sentence as the unit of analysis
Content analysis was performed on audio and text messages generated by 60 subjects equally distributed across three ing coordination such as decision making about how the task should be performed (TC); statements that are related to the content of the task such as information assessment, layout, structure, and revision of report (TC); statements that concern all statements with a social orientation that are not related to the assignment or regarding technical issues of the system being used (NT). A summary of these categories and examples are depicted in Table 2 . Following this coding scheme, two human judges coded a total of 3826 messages across all experimental conditions. For the coding procedure of audio conver-sations, we used a subtitle editor program called Aegisub. Although this tool was developed as a subtitle editor, the main functionalities are particularly useful for coding as well as for transcription. 4.3. Data post-processing
After completing the coding stage for each team, we conducted a post processing procedure in order to ensure the proper to be Kappa = 0.799 ( p &lt; 0.01 ).
 5. Evaluation
In order to perform comparisons across conditions, we devised an evaluation method, which consisted of four sets of measures: communication, productivity, information synthesis, and cognitive/affective load measures. 5.1. Communication measures
For each team, we computed frequencies of codes under each coding category (i.e. TC, TN, TS, NT, and NC). These numbers ume corresponds to the amount of messages exchanged by team members during the task; communication effort represents the overall time spent by participants in communication; and the last measure indicates the communication balance of the team in terms of the number of messages issued by each team member. Description of each measure and their formulations are presented in Table 3 . 5.2. Productivity measures
In order to measure the productivity of teams, we used the set of measures described in Shah and Gonz X lez-Ib X  X ez (2011) . These measures included the union of all webpages visited by all teams (U); the union of all webpages bookmarked visited by a given team within U r (C r ); the total number of relevant pages visited only by a given team within U implicit measure of usefulness based on the dwell time on a webpage (UsW) ( White &amp; Huang, 2010 ); and Lavenshtein dis-productivity evaluation are particularly useful for comparing teams across different scenarios of collaboration. 5.3. Information synthesis measures
As indicated above, in addition to bookmark pages and collect snippets from them, teams in all conditions had to produce quality of these reports, we evaluated them using standard tests of readability as well as assessments given by human cod-ers. Note that these tests and the associated evaluation do not truly evaluate the quality of the content or the retrieval performance.
 characters, syllables, words, and sentences. Some of these tests have been used to assess magazines, handbooks, academic reports, and health messages, among other types of content. Although these measures share similar principles, we computed all three with the aim of ensuring consistency.

In addition to automated readability analyses, documents were assessed by two external coders. They evaluated the re-ports based on four categories, namely content, resources, organization, and style, and for each category they gave a score of reports was evaluated in terms of the amount and quality of information provided for the questions being asked in the task. Resources were evaluated based on the number as well as the variety of resources used in the report. Organization of reports was assessed with regards to the extent to which the information is synthesized and grouped in an organized man-all four categories was found to be Kappa &gt; 0.7 ( p &lt; 0.01 ). 5.4. Cognitive and affective measures
In order to measure the cognitive load and affective experience of team members, we applied two instruments as pre-task participant (Eq. (5) ).
 tion, and irritation. Time pressure, on the other hand, was estimated through a specific question in the NASA-TLX question-naire:  X  X  X ow hurried or rushed was the pace of the task? X  X  6. Results 6.1. Communication
Our first research question addressed the communication dynamics of teams in different communication contexts in a CIS task. We used an existing coding scheme based on a CSCL task to identify the communication dynamics of teams in a CIS task ( Table 2 ). During the coding process, our analysis revealed three subcategories of communication messages, namely: strat-egy (S), information seeking (IS), and awareness (A). These specific kinds of messages resulted from the nature of task and
Teams used different strategies for dividing up the task and writing the report. They negotiated when to stop searching and in the gulf and attempts at fixing it and then we can both do the last one (long term implications and lessons learned) to-gether X  X  a team member proposed an initial plan to tackle the task without room for negotiation. In other examples (such as  X  X  X anna start at the top of the list and work your way towards the middle and ill start at the bottom and work my way to-wards to middle? X  X  or  X  X  X o you want to split it up or how do you want to do the project? X  X ) team members both suggested a strategy and left room for negotiation by asking to their partners if they agreed with the proposed plan. We also found the exchange of strategy messages in the middle of the session, suggesting dynamic adaptation. For example in the following adapted their initial strategy based on their progress during the session and the remaining time they had to complete the task.

The information seeking subcategory included all types of statements regarding coordination with respect to the infor-mation seeking process such as which and how many information sources to use. For example, in the message  X  X  X earch  X  X ulf share bookmarks and snippets, the participant in this example preferred communication over the tool for sharing informa-human health and ecosystem health X  X , in which the participant reported to his partner what seemed to be useful findings.
Finally, the last subcategory included all types of statements regarding the awareness of task or time. For instance, team members made each other aware of which question they were addressing at the given moment, how much time left to finish 10 min lol X  X , and  X  X  X h, I was looking at the snippets. I see them now X  X .
 These new themes align with the literature in that coordination and awareness are central in CIS ( Shah, 2010b ).
Additionally, we investigated how communication context affects interactions of teams within a CIS task. Fig. 2 depicts task related. The results and pairwise comparison among the three conditions are reported in Table 6 . As shown, we found that those with audio support (C1 f2f and C3 audio+text ) produced a higher volume of communication (C1
C2 sures among the conditions ( Table 7 ). Our results showed that those in C1 task messages compared to those in C2 text . However, those in C1 task coordination, while no differences were found between C2
C3 and engagement) than those in C2 text , without having wasted any additional effort in coordination as in C1
C3 audio+text got the best of both in C1 f2f and C2 text conditions.
 Second, an examination within teams revealed variations in terms of communication between partners across conditions.
In C1 f2f , teams produced similar amounts of task content and task social messages. In C2 majority of messages on task coordination and content with limited social messages. As well, teams in C2 balance of communication messages than those in C1 f2f or C3 conditions (co-present or remotely located), which had disparity in communication initiation/production, those in C2 changed messages only when a team member initiated a conversation either for a question or a comment. In such cases, other team members either answered to a question or confirmed to a feedback. In C3 of task content, task coordination, and task social messages. Finally, although teams in C1 to exchange text messages, audio communication was predominant. Indeed, text messages were mainly used for interactions with the researcher to get answers for technical or task-related issues.

Third, we also wanted to map out how teams working in a CIS task spend their communication efforts throughout the task. By doing a minute-by-minute analysis for each communication factor, we found certain patterns in terms of cumulative effort and cumulative task-content communication. From minutes 2 to 16, the teams in C3 time communicating than C2 text , but no significant difference between C1 task-content communication, we found that from minute 1 to 21, teams in C3 content than teams in C2 text . 6.2. Productivity
Our second research question addresses the effect of co-located, text chat, and audio + text chat communication on per-formance of teams within a CIS task. We found no significant differences in productivity among conditions as measured by various forms of coverage and relevance (precision, recall, F -measure). To gain a better understanding of differences in working styles that may impact productivity, we looked at the amount of useful information (webpages) found (see Table 3 ).
We discovered that while C1 f2f performed at par with C2 text
More importantly, we looked at the searches performed by every team and measured query diversity between the mem-bers of a given team to understand how interdependently they worked. We found that those in C1 in searching than those in C2 text or C3 audio+text ( Tables 8 and 9 ). 6.3. Information synthesis
As one of the products of the CIS task that participants performed, we also explored the effects of different forms of com-munication on information synthesis within a CIS task. Evaluations based on readability tests and human assessment did not average report would be better understood by people with at least 13 years of formal education, in other words, university 6.4. Cognitive and affective factors Our third research question asked how communication context influences the cognitive load of teams within a CIS task.
To better understand the implications of providing a specific communication channel, we looked at self-reported cognitive load on the participants. No differences were found between C1
C3 audio+text reported experiencing less cognitive load than those in C1
In terms of affective load, an analysis of the responses to the PANAS questionnaire revealed that the ratings to the neg-ative emotional factors raised more for C1 f2f than for C3 vel of negative affects for those sitting in the same room. In addition, using the adapted formulation of Nahl X  X  (2007) ,we found significant difference ( p&lt;.05 ) between C1 f2f and C3 10 and 11 ). 7. Discussion and implications
The findings present the cost-benefit picture of each communication context in interaction and performance of teams. For example, we found that F2F setup allows team members to interact effortlessly, generating a larger volume of communica-tion compared to those that collaborate remotely. While such effortless communication involves discussion about the task, sified in their information exploration compared to remotely located teammates.

Along with the literature presented above, computer-mediated context seems to limit the social aspects of communica-tion in a CIS task, due to limited capacity of information exchange and extra effort needed for communication. For example, orators. Although, such divided efforts could be time-consuming our results showed that chat messages were used more pur-posefully and effectively with a focus mostly on task-related conversations.

The condition with remotely located participants with audio support (C3 doing work. As reported in the previous section, although text-chat channel was available for participants in C3 dition, audio communication was predominant.

An interesting finding was revealed in our minute-by-minute analysis. Teams in C3 communicating than C2 text between minutes 2 and 16. We suggest the following explanation for this: As soon as teams in
C2 text decided on a strategy during the first minute, they may have preferred to avoid communication as much as possible, in order to conserve their efforts for the task. Likewise, the analysis in terms of task-content communication revealed that teams in C3 audio+text spent more time discussing task content than those in C2
These instances show that teams communicated strategically to compensate the limitations of the text channel, which al-lowed them to spend more time on the task.

With regards to our second research question which explored the implications of communication contexts in the produc-as defined in this study.

The analysis of diversity, however, showed that those working co-located (C1 for information than those working in remotely-located conditions (C2 access. On the other hand, remotely located participants were able to have more independence in their exploration than those co-located (C1 f2f ) due to diminished interaction in less socially present context. Overall, the findings show that
C3 audio+text gets the better of the other two conditions  X  it allows participants to achieve independence like C2 thing deemed to be important for a dividable task  X  while helping teams discover more useful information through their interactions.

Through our third research question, we also explored the implications of communication contexts in the cognitive and affective load of teams within a CIS task. Our results indicated that those working face to face (C1 nitive load than those working remotely located with an audio channel enabled (C3 increased the levels of content related information exchange, and thereby increased the cognitive load of team members.
Along these lines, being remotely located diminished the levels of interaction and task related information exchange and hence allowed participants to be more relaxed and distraction-free. These findings were also supported in our end-session interviews. Those in C1 f2f reported often being distracted by having their teammate located in the same space.
In terms of affective load, results indicated a significant increase of negative affects in participants working co-located (C1 through which they express their personal experiences while working on a task. For instance, participants expressed nega-tive opinions when they could not find relevant information or when they stressed out due to time constraints while trying
Lower levels of social presence in audio context diminished the amount of task related social information exchange, leading to decreases in affective load. Although sharing negative opinions and experiences about the task may promote social sup-port and positive ones may be motivating for participants, too much sharing of positive and negative experiences seem to diminish possible positive effects for the task. In that sense, we found that C3
C1 f2f for managing both affective and cognitive loads.

This study has several implications. For instance, it has been argued that F2F communication is the richest way of com-municating ( Daft &amp; Lengel, 1984; Foster, 2006 ) and for years many have attempted to enrich mediated communication by providing resources that make mediated interactions close to face-to-face ones. Our findings suggest that F2F is not always better or more productive; the choice for a spatial setup and/or communication preference may depend heavily on the nat-brainstorming) are better performed in F2F, whereas easily dividable tasks (e.g., the task used in our experiment) benefit more from the collaborators working remotely (independently). Of course, this implication should be understood in proper context of the task requirements  X  we are not advocating a lack of social interactions or disconnected work by  X  X  X ndepen-dence, X  X  since even independent work done in collaboration may require assessment of partial results, strategy definition, and awareness. Therefore, our findings indicate that there has to be adequate and appropriate amount of communication for the given CIS project.
 This notion of adequate and appropriate communication bears more discussion. We found that C2 amount of independence among the participants while giving them minimal choices for communication. To promote more social interactions and interactions in general, teams could work in the same space (C1 diversity and more distractions during their work. In other words, simply providing more freedom to communicate was not enough; the assigned task required at least some level of independence, which C1 more communication choices compared to C2 TEXT , at the same time allowed the participants to be more independent than those in C1 F2F . This also created more balanced cost-benefit factors for cognitive and affective load. C3 both adequate and appropriate communication channels for the given CIS task.
 As a system designer, one could put these lessons in practice by understanding (1) the space and time contexts in which a possible), audio and/or video (if remotely located) forms of communication, whereas for information gathering parts, the communication options could be taken away or put in periphery so that the participants could focus on the task. If, on one may make audio or video channels prominent and/or mandatory.

There are limitations associated to the experiment design. First, the experimental nature of the study lacks the effect of contextual factors in the performance of participants. Our work here was limited by the nature of the task (time-bound, divisible, and exploratory search), time context (synchronous), and group size (two members per team). For instance, orga-nizational and educational context may offer intrinsic or extrinsic rewards that motivate or discourage the performance of teams. In addition, extrinsic factors such as time limit might also influence the type and amount of information shared through different communication modes. For instance, the assigned task was limited to 30-min, which might have affected dressed in future studies. 8. Conclusion
Through a controlled laboratory study, we assessed the pros and cons of three different setups of people working in syn-chronous collaborative information seeking (CIS) task. The contributions of the work reported here based on this study are design, a unique combination of interesting and challenging task, and a system for providing CIS-related tools and logging user activities. Second, we proposed a set of evaluation measures that incorporated assessment of communicated messages ent spatial settings while performing a CIS task.

Our analysis demonstrated that for a divisible and exploratory search task with a recall-oriented goal, those with more independence achieve more diversity in information resources, which may help them explore a greater variety of relevant information, and thus, those with remotely-located participants were found to be more diverse in their exploration than co-located teams. Having more social presence increased interactions among the participants as it was natural for them to talk to each other while working, but these interactions were often found to be distracting for a time-bound task. One may argue that more interactions could be beneficial characteristics to have for improving participants X  engagement in collaboration even if it means sacrificing some productivity. While that may be the case, we showed that remotely located participants with audio support could achieve the best of both the setups; they exercised the same amount of independence as those remotely located with only text interactions, while carrying out just as many interactions with each other as those in the co-located condition with fewer distractions.

We have shown that the implications of these contributions go beyond addressing the research questions investigated here, by providing guidelines to balance costs and benefits of various communication channels while supporting group work.
These contributions are valuable not simply for CIS, but the larger domain of human X  X omputer interaction and information retrieval (HCIR). For instance, the reported findings demonstrate how the issues of control, communication, and awareness seeking conditions. These issues are considered to be highly important for designing and evaluating user-centered IR sys-tems ( Rodden, 1991; Rodden &amp; Blair, 1991 ).
