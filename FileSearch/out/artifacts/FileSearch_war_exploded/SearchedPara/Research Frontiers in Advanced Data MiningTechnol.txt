 Data mining, as the confluence of multiple intertwined disciplines, including statis-tics, machine learning, pattern recognition, database systems, information retrieval , World-Wide Web ,and many application domains , has achieved great progress in the past decade [1]. Similar to many research fields, data mining has two general direc-tions: theoretical foundations and advanced technologies and applications .Herewefo-cus on advanced technologies and applications in data mining and discuss some recent progress in this direction. Notice that some popular research topics, such as privacy-preserving data mining, are not covered in the discussion for lack of space/time. Our discussion is organized into nine themes, and we briefly outline the current status and research problems in each theme. Frequent pattern mining has been a focused theme in data mining research for over a decade. Abundant literature has been dedicated to this research and tremendous progress has been made, ranging from efficient and scalable algorithms for frequent itemset min-ing in transaction databases to numerous res earch frontiers, such as sequential pattern mining, structural pattern mining, correlation mining, associative classification, and frequent-pattern-based clustering, as well as their broad applications.

Recently, studies have proceeded to scalab le methods for mining colossal patterns where the size of the patterns could be rather large so that the step-by-step growth using an Apriori-like approach does not work, methods for pattern compression, extraction of high-quality top-k patterns, and understanding patterns by context analysis and gener-ation of semantic annotations. Moreover, frequent patterns have been used for effective classification by top-k rule generation for long patterns a nd discriminative frequent pat-tern analysis. Frequent patterns have also been used for clustering of high-dimensional biological data. Scalable methods for mining long, approximate, compressed, and so-phisticated patterns for advanced applica tions, such as biological sequences and net-works, and the exploration of mined patterns for classification, clustering, correlation analysis, and pattern understanding will still be interesting topics in research. Google X  X  PageRank algorithm has started a revolution on Internet search. However, since information network analysis covers many additional aspects and needs scalable and effective methods, the systematic study of this domain has just started, with many interesting issues to be explored. Information network analysis has broad applications, covering social and biological network analysis, computer network intrusion detection, software program analysis, terrorist network discovery, and Web analysis.

One interesting direction is to treat inform ation network as graphs and further de-velop graph mining methods. Recent progress o n graph mining and its associated struc-tural pattern-based classification and clus tering, graph indexing, and similarity search will play an important role in information network analysis. Moreover, since informa-tion networks often form huge, multidimensi onal heterogeneous graphs, mining noisy, approximate, and heterogene ous subgraphs based on differe nt applications for the con-struction of application-specific networks with sophisticated structures will help in-formation network analysis substantially. The discovery of the power law distribu-tion of information networks and the rules on density evolution of information net-works will help develop effective algorithms for network analysis. Finally, the study of link analysis, heterogeneous data integrati on, user-guided clustering, user-based net-work construction, will provide essential methodology for the in-depth study in this direction. Stream data refers to the data that flows into the system in vast volume, changing dy-namically, possibly infinite, and containing multi-dimensional features. Such data can-not be stored in traditional database systems, and moreover, most systems may only be able to read the stream once in sequential ord er. This poses great challenges on effective mining of stream data.

With substantial research, progress has bee made on efficient methods for mining fre-quent patterns in data streams, multidimensional analysis of stream data (such as con-struction of stream cubes), stream data classification, stream clustering, stream outlier analysis, rare event detection, and so on. The general philosophy is to develop single-scan algorithms to collective informatio n about stream data in tilted time windows, exploring micro-clustering, limited aggregation, and approximation. It is important to explore new applications of stream data mining, e.g. , real-time detection of anomaly in computer networks, power-grid flow, and other stream data. With the popularity of sensor networks, GPS, cellular phones, other mobile devices, and RFID technology, tremendous amount of moving object data has been collected, calling for effective analysis. There are many new research issues on mining moving object data, RFID data, and data from senso r networks. For example, how to explore correlation and regularity to clean noisy sensor network and RFID data, how to integrate and construct data warehouses for such data, how to perform scalable mining for peta-byte RFID data, how to find strange moving objects, how to cluster trajectory data, and so on. With time, location, moving direction, speed, as well as multidimensional semantics of moving object data, likely multi-dimensional data mining will play an essential role in this study. The real world data is usually related to space, time, and in multimedia modes ( e.g. , containing color, image, audio, and video). With the popularity of digital photos, audio DVDs, videos, YouTube, Internet-based map services, weather services, satellite im-ages, digital earth, and many other forms of multimedia and spatiotemporal data, min-ing spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, and multimedia data will become increasingly popular, with far-reaching implications. For example, mining satellite images may help detect forest fire, find unusual phenomena on earth, and predict hurricanes, weather patterns, and global warming trends.

Research in this domain needs the confluence of multiple disciplines including im-age processing, pattern recognition, parallel processing, and data mining. Automatic categorization of images and videos, classification of spatiotemporal data, finding fre-quent/sequential patterns and outliers, spatial collocation analysis, and many other tasks have been studied popularly. With the mounting in many applications, scalable analysis of spatiotemporal and multimedia data will be an important research frontier for a long time. With the fast progress of biological res earch and the accumulation of vast amount of biological data (especially, a great deal of it has been made available on the Web), bi-ological data mining has become a very active field, including comparative genomics, evolution and phylogeny, biological database s and data integration, biological sequence analysis, biological network analysis, biological image analysis, biological literature analysis ( e.g. , PubMed), and systems biology. This domain is largely overlapped with bioinformatics but data mining researchers has been emphasizing on integrating biolog-ical databases with biological data integration, constructing biological data warehouses, analyzing biological networks, and developing various kinds of scalable bio-data min-ing algorithms.

Advances in biology, medicine, and bioinformatics provide data miners with abun-dant real data sets and a broad spectrum of challenging research problems. It is expected that an increasing number of data miners w ill devoted themselves to this domain and make contributions to the advances in both bioinformatics and data mining. The Web has become the ultimate information access and processing platform, housing not only billions of link-accessed  X  X ages X , containing textual data, multimedia data, and linkages, on the surface Web, but also query-accessed  X  X atabases X  on the deep Web. With the advent of Web 2.0, there is an increasing amount of dynamic  X  X orkflow X  emerging. With its penetrating deeply into our daily life and evolving into unlimited dynamic applications, the Web is central in our information infrastructure. Its virtually unlimited scope and scale render imme nse opportunities for data mining.

Text mining and information extraction have been applied not only to Web mining but also to the analysis of other kinds of semi-structured and unstructured informa-tion, such as digital libraries, biological information systems, business intelligence and customer relationship management, computer-aided instructions, and office automation systems.

There are lots of research issues in this domain, which takes the collaborative efforts of multiple disciplines, including information retrieval, databases, data mining, natural language processing, and machine learning. Some promising research topics include heterogeneous information integration, info rmation extraction, personalized informa-tion agents, application-specific partial Web construction and mining, in-depth Web semantics analysis, and turning Web into relatively structured information-base. Software program executions and computer system/network operations potentially gen-erate huge amounts of data. Data mining can be performed on such data to monitor system status, improve system performance, isolate software bugs, detect software pla-giarism, analyze computer system faults, uncover network intrusions, and recognize system malfunctions.

Data mining for software and system engineering can be partitioned into static anal-ysis and dynamic/stream analysis, based on whether the system can collect traces be-forehand for post-analysis or it must react at real time to handle online data. Differ-ent methods have been developed in this domain by integration and extension of the methods developed in machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition, and statis-tics. However, this is still a rich domain for data miners with further development of sophisticated, scalable, and real-time data mining methods.
 Viewing and mining data in multidimensional space will substantially increase the power and flexibility of data analysis. Data cube computation and OLAP (online analytical processing) technologies developed in data warehouse have substantially in-creased the power of multidimensional analysis of large datasets. Besides traditional data cubes, there are recent studies on cons truction of regression cubes, prediction cubes, and other sophisticated statistics-or iented data cubes. Such multi-dimensional, especially high-dimensional, analysis tools will ensure data can be analyzed in hier-archical, multidimensional structures efficiently and flexibly at user X  X  finger tips. This leads to the integration of online analytical processing with data mining, called OLAP mining.

We believe that OLAP mining will substantially enhance the power and flexibility of data analysis and bring the analysis methods derived from the research in machine learning, pattern recognition, and statistics into convenient analysis of massive data with hierarchical structures in multidimensional space. It is a promising research field that may lead to the popular adoption of data mining in information industry.
