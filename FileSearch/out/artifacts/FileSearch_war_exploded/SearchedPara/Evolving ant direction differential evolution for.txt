 1. Introduction
The optimal power flow problem (OPF) problem is an optimiza-tion tool through which the electric utilities strive to determine secure and operating conditions for a power system. The OPF solution aims to optimize a selected objective function via optimal adjustment of the power system control variables, while satisfying various equality and inequality constraints. The OPF problem, in general, is a large-scale highly constrained nonlinear non-convex optimization problem. OPF problem has been solved by conven-tional and evolutionary based algorithms. Many mathematical programming techniques such as linear programming (LP), non-linear programming (NLP), quadratic programming (QP), Newton method and interior point methods (IPM) have been applied to solve the OPF problem successfully ( Momoh et al., 1999; Habiabollahzadeh and Luo, 1989; Burchet et al., 1984; Mota-Palomino and Quintana, 1986; Sun et al., 1984; Yan and Quintana, 1999 ). Usually, these methods rely on the assumption that the fuel cost characteristic of a generating unit is a smooth, convex function. However, there are situations where it is not possible, or even appropriate, to represent the unit X  X  fuel cost characteristics as a convex function. This situation arises when valve-points X  units prohibited operating zones and piecewise quadratic cost characteristics are present ( Sayah and Zehar, 2008 ).
In recent years, many heuristic a lgorithms, such as genetic algo-rithms (GA) ( Lai and Ma, 1997 ), evolutionary programming ( Yuryevich and Wong, 1999 ), simulated annealing ( Roa-Sepulveda and Pavez-
Lazo, 2003 ),tabusearch ( Abido,2002 )and particle swarm optimization ( Abido,2002 )havebeenproposedforsolvingtheOPFproblem,without any restrictions on the shape of the cost curves. Moreover, many hybrid algorithms have been introduced to enhance the search efficiency. For instance, a hybrid tabu search and simulated annealing (TS/TA) ( Ongsakul and Bhasaputra, 2002 ) was applied to solve the OPF with flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) device problem; hybrid evolutionary programming and tabu search or improved tabu search (ITS) ( Lin et al., 2002 ) was used to solve the economic dispatch problem with non-smooth cost functions. Mean-while, improved evolutionary programming (IEP) ( Wang et al., 2002 ) was successfully used to solve combinatorial optimization problems.
In the recent past, Storn and Pric e introduced a powerful evolu-tionary algorithm called differential evolution (DE) to solve numerical global optimization problems, like the OPF problem ( Storn and Price, 1997 ). DE is a numerical optimization approach that is simple, easy to implement, faster than many evolutionary algorithms and robust. DE combines simple arithmetic operators with the classical operators of crossover, mutation and selection to evolve from a randomly generated starting population to a final solution. Each parent competes one-on-one against its corresponding offspring and the fitter of the two becomes a member of the next generation.
The DE algorithm has been successfully applied to various power system optimization problems such as generation expan-sion planning ( Kannan et al., 2005 ) and hydrothermal scheduling ( Lakshminarasimman a nd Subramanian, 2006 ). Figueroa and Cederio ( 2004 ) applied DE for power system state estimation. Coelho and
Mariani ( 2006 ) used this algorithm for economic dispatch with valve-point effect. Basu ( 2008 ) applied DE for solving the OPF problem incorporating FACTS devices. The hybrid differential evolution (HDE) has been employed for the solution of a large capacitor placement problem ( Chiou et al., 2004 ). The mixed integer hybrid differential evolution(MIHDE)hasbeenemployedforhydrothermalcoordination ( Lakshminarasimman and Subramanian, 2007a ), hydrothermal opti-mal power flow ( Lakshminarasimman and Subramanian, 2007b )and the network reconfiguration problem ( Su and Lee, 2003 ). The variable scaling hybrid differential evolution algorithm has been used for 2005 ).
 system (AS) and applied it to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) ( Dorigo and Gambardella, 1997 ). The ant algorithm has been inspired by the behavior of real ant colonies, in particular, by their foraging behavior. Recently, the ant algorithm has been applied to various optimization problems, such as the short-term generation scheduling problem ( Yu et al., 1998 ),unitcommitment( Sisworahardio and El-Keib, 2002 ) and hydro-electricgenerationscheduling( Huang,2001 ). approach is proposed to solve the OPF problem with non-smooth cost functions. Evolving ant direction mutation operator selection is suggested to the original DE algorithm. Though there are five mutation operations stated in this paper, the EADDE uses only one mutation operator in every generation during the solution process. The proposed EADDE method embedded with the ant colony search is able to constantly choose different but most appropriate mutation operators during the solution process to accelerate the search for the global optimum solution. In the proposed algorithm, power flow problem is solved by Newton
Raphson method; the control variables for power flow are opti-mized (overall optimization) by the differential evolution method.
The mutation operator (out of five operators) for the differential evolution is selected by ant direction search and the ant parameters are evolved by genetic algorithm method. The proposed approach has been examined and tested on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus standard test systems with three different objective functions.
Simulation results demonstrate that the EADDE algorithm is super-ior to the original DE algorithm and provides significantly better results compared to those reported in the literature.
 concept and the ant direction hybrid differential evolution for solving the OPF problem, which was not applied to OPF in the literature so far. The remainderof the paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 describes the formulation of an optimal power flow problem, while Section 3 explains the standard DE approach.
Section 4 then details the procedure of the proposed evolving and direction DE and Section 5 presents the results of the optimization and compares the methods used to solve the case studies of optimal power flow problems with IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus systems. Lastly, Section 6 outlines the conclusion. 2. Problem formulation several equality and inequality constraints. The problem can be mathematically modeled as follows:
Min OF  X  x , u  X  X  1  X  subject to g  X  x , u  X  X  0  X  2  X  h min r h  X  x , u  X  r h max  X  3  X  where vector x denotes the state variables of a power system networkthatcontainstheslackbusrealpoweroutput( P G 1 ),voltage magnitudes and phase angles of the load buses  X  V i , d i generator reactive power outputs ( Q G ). Vector u represents control variables that consist of real power generation levels ( P generator voltages magnitudes ( 9 V GN 9 ), transformer tap settings ( T ) and reactive power injections ( Q CK ) due to volt-amperes reactive (VAR) compensations; i.e. u  X  X  P G 2 ... P GN , V G 1 ... V GN , T 1 ... T NT , Q C 1 where N  X  number of generator buses, NT  X  number of tap changing transformers and CS  X  number of shunt reactive power injections. The OPF problem has two categories of constraints:
Equality constraints : These are the sets of nonlinear power flow equations that govern the power system, i.e.
 P Q where P Gi and Q Gi aretherealandreactivepoweroutputsinjectedat bus i , respectively; the load demand at the same bus is represented by P Di and Q Di , and elements of the bus admittance matrix are represented by Y ij and y ij .

Inequality constraints : These are the sets of constraints that represent the system operational and security limits like the bounds on the following: (1) generators real and reactive power outputs: (2) voltage magnitudes at each bus in the network: (3) transformer tap settings: (4) reactive power injections due to capacitor banks: (5) transmission lines loading: (6) voltage stability index:
Handling of constraints: There are various ways to handle constraints in evolutionary computation optimization algorithms.
In this paper, the constraints corresponding to state or dependent variables are incorporated into the fitness function by means of a penalty function method. In this method, a penalty factor multi-plied with the square of the violated value of variable is added to the objective function and any infeasible solution obtained is rejected. The constraints corresponding to control or independent variables are handled in programming part by forcing them to be within the limits.
 3. Overview of differential evolution
The DE algorithm is a population-based algorithm like genetic algorithms using the similar operators: crossover, mutation and selection. The main difference in constructing better solutions is that DE encodes parameters as floating-point numbers and that its mutation operation does not rely on a predefined probability distribution, but on the differences of randomly sampled pairs of solutions in the population. The algorithm uses the mutation operation as a search mechanism and a selection operation to direct the search toward the prospective regions in the search space. The DE algorithm also uses a uniform crossover that can take child vector parameter from one parent more often than it does from others. Using the components of the existing population members to construct trial vectors, the recombination (crossover) operator shuffles information about successful combinations, enabling the search for a better solution space ( Wong and Dong, 2005 ).

An optimization task consisting of D parameters can be repre-sented by a D -dimensional vector. In DE, a population of NP solution vectors is randomly created at the start. This population is successfully improved applying mutation, crossover and selec-tion operators.

The main DE algorithm is described as follows. 3.1. Initialization
The initial population of NP vectors is randomly selected based on uniform probability distribution for all variables to cover the entire search uniformly. Each individual X i is a vector that contains as many parameters as the problem decision variables D . Random values are assigned to each decision parameter in every vector according to X where i  X  1, y , NP and j  X  1, y , D ; X min j and X max j bounds of the j th decision variable; U ( X min j , X max random variable ranging over [ X min j , X max j ]. x 0 ij is the initial j th variable of i th population. All the vectors should satisfy the constraints. 3.2. Evaluation
Evaluate the fitness value of each individual (in this work, the goal is to minimize the cost function). 3.3. Mutation
For each target vector x i , G , a mutated line recombinant vector is produced by v different from each other.

In Eq. (15), F is the scaling factor that has an effect on the 3.4. Crossover
The parent vector is mixed with the mutated vector to produce a u randomly chosen index. 3.5. Selection
All solutions in the population have the same chances of being selected as parents without dependence of their fitness value. In or equal to that of the parent (so that the population can move across flat function landscapes).

Price and Storn (1997) gave the working principle of DE with simple strategy. Later on, they suggested ten different strategies of
DE ( Price et al., 2005 ). Strategy-7 (DE/rand/1/bin) is the most successful and widely used strategy. The key parameters of control in DE are population size ( NP ), scaling factor ( F ) and crossover constant ( CR ). However, the selection of mutation operator is another very important issue in the DE application. A proper mutation operator can accelerate searching out the global solution ( Chiou and Wang, 1999, 2001; Fan and Lampinen, 2003 ).
In this paper, the promising optimization approach such as ACO is applied for the selection of best mutation operator with the best set of ACO parameters evolved by a genetic algorithm ( Botee and
Bonabeau, 1998 ). 4. Proposed algorithm for OPF by evolving ant direction differential evolution
Themain ideaof EADDEis tousethe ant colonysearch systemto find the proper mutation operator to accelerate the search for the global solution ( Wang and Liu, 2006 ). The optimal values of ant colony parameters are evolved by genetic algorithm ( Hozefa and Botee, 1998 ). The EADDE is discussed in the following: Step 1: Initialization
The initial population is generated randomly and is given by the following equation:
X where rand () denotes a uniformly distributed random number withintherange[0,1].Thisproduces NP individualsof X 0 i randomly.
During initialization, the control variables, real power genera-tions, generator voltages, transformer taps and shunt reactive power injections are randomly generated within the allowable ranges. The maximum and minimum values of generator voltages, transformer taps and shunt reactive power injections are given in Table 1 .

The ant colony parameters such as the relative importance of the pheromone trail a , relative importance of the visibility b , evaporation factor r and scaling factor for the modification of the trail Q are randomly generated as binary strings to be subjected to
GA search and are converted into the values within the limits given in Table 2 as mentioned in Botee and Bonabeau (2003 ) and pheromone trail t is initialized heuristically to a small value. Step 2:
Run power flow by Newton Raphson method and evaluate the fitness value of each individual.
 according to heuristic information and pheromone information. In normal ant direction search, the a , b , r and Q are fixed, whereas in this proposed method these parameters are evolved using genetic algorithm method so that ant direction search is optimal. Standard GA implementation is used here which includes reproduction by
Roulette-wheel selection, single-point crossover and mutation pro-cedurestofindtheoptimalsetofparametersforACO.Theparameters taken for GA search are: the length of the strings 16, the crossover probability 0.95 and the mutation probability 0.01. The fluctuant pheromone quantity is constructed based on the difference between the objective function value in the next generation and the best objective function value in the present generation and is given by objective value of the next generation is better than the best objective function value of the present generation; where Q is the scaling factor for the modification of the trail and LK is defined as the following:
LK  X  object new best where best present expresses the best objective function value of the present generation and object new expresses the objective function value of the next generation.
 t new i  X  X  1 r  X  t old i  X  r D t i  X  20  X  operator is proportional to the pheromone quantity t i and the where X G  X  1 ij denotes the j th gene of the i th individual in a population in the ( G +1)th generation, n is the number of units and X G bj denotes the j th gene of the best individual in a population in the G th generation. Hence, the probability of choosing a mutation operator is defined as follows:
P i  X  t  X  X  where a and b are parameters to regulate the influence of t , respectively.
 the procedure for selecting the mutation operators in every generation is given here. For the given five mutation operators, the probability from 0.0 to1.0 is divided into five parts say (0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0). Five integers are generated randomly between 1 and 5 say (3 2 5 1 4). As per the probabilities calculated in Step 3, if the probability of one ant is greater than 0.2 and less than or equal to 0.4, then operator 2 is selected and this process is continued for the remaining ants. The five mutation operators are taken from Wong and Dong (2005 ) and are given below: X X X X X i  X  X  X where F is the mutation constant, r 1 a r 2 a r 3 a r 4 a randomly chosen indices from the population, NP . Eq. (27) is the trigonometric mutation operator ( Fan and Lampinen, 2003 ), and the values of p i , i  X  1, 2, 3 are obtained by p  X  with p u  X  9 f  X  X G r 1  X  9  X  9 f  X  X G r 2  X  9  X  9 f  X  X be optimized.
 Step 5: Crossover operation
Crossover or recombination is a complementary process for differential evolution. Crossover aims at reinforcing prior successes by generating child individuals out of the existing individuals. In order to extend the diversity of further individuals at the next generation, the perturbed individual of ^ X G  X  1 i and the present individual of X G i are chosen by comparing a random number to the crossover constant (CR) to decide which vector donates its para-meter values to their offspring. CR is used to determine if the newly generated individual is to be recombined. Each parameter j of the i th individual is reproduced from the perturbed individual and the present individual X G i as follows: ^ X where i  X  1, y , NP , j  X  1, y n and n  X  number of parameters. Step 6: Estimation and selection
The fitness of the offspring is in competition with its parent. The parent is replaced by its offspring if the fitness of the offspring is better than that of its parent. On the other hand, the parent is retained in the next generation if the fitness of the offspring is worse than that of its parent. The trial vector is accepted even if its function value is the same as that of the parent. These two forms are presented as follows: X i  X  arg max f  X  X G i  X  , f  X  X b  X  arg max f  X  X where arg max means the argument of the maximum. Here arg max is used because the fitness function, f  X  1/ OF , where OF is the extended objective function that is to be minimized. Step 7: Repeat Steps 2 X 6 until maximum generation quantity is reached.
The power flow algorithm is applied for each candidate solution to evaluate its fitness and determine the state variables. The optimization procedure stops whenever a predetermined number of generations is reached.
 5. Simulation results and discussion 5.1. IEEE 30-bus system
The proposed algorithm was implemented in MATLAB comput-ing environment with Pentium-IV, 2.66 GHz computer with 512 MB RAM. The standard IEEE 30-bus test system was used to test effectiveness of EADDE approach. The test system consists of six generating units interconnected with 41 branches of a trans-mission network with a total load of 283.4 MW and 126.2 MVAR. The bus data and the branch data are taken from Alsac and Stott (1973) . The original system has two capacitor banks installed at buses 5 and 24 with ratings of 19 and 4 MVAR, respectively. These capacitor banks are not considered in this work, rather the shunt injections are provided at buses 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24 and 29 as given in Abido (2002 ). In this case study, bus 1 is considered as the swing bus.

The cost coefficients and maximum and minimum limits of real power generations with three different types of generator cost curves are given in Ongsakul and Tantimaporn (2006). The max-imum and minimum values for the generator voltage and tap changing transformer control variables are 1.1 and 0.9 in per unit, respectively. The maximum and minimum voltages for the load buses are considered to be 1.05 and 0.95 in per unit, respectively. The line flow limits are taken from Alsac and Stott (1973) . The voltage stability index is considered from Kessel and Glavitch (1986 ).

Inthe normal ant colony searchprocedure the parameters a , b , r and Q are fixed. Generally, it is not easy to find optimal set of parameters for ant colony search. This is to be done heur-istically through trail and error procedure. In this paper, these parameters are not fixed, but are e volved using genetic algorithm ( Hozefa and Botee, 1998 ) so that better solution of OPF can be found with best mutation operator using optimal parameters of ant colony search. The ranges of evolving parameters are given in Table 2 .

In this simulation study, minimization of different objectives under different cases is considered to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The objective functions taken into considera-tion are quadratic fuel cost, piecewise quadratic fuel cost and quadratic cost model with valve-point loading effects. All the objective functions are augmented with the equality, inequality and voltage stability constraints.

In each case study, two sets of 20 test runs for solving the OPF problem were performed: the first set (DE-OPF) is based on the classical differential evolution algorithm and the second one (EADDE-OPF) is based on the evolving ant direction differential evolution algorithm. Moreover, various values of F and CR are also considered for simulations with different population sizes. The values of F and CR , population sizes, maximum number of genera-tions and penalty factors are given in Table A.1 .

Nowadays the interconnected power systems are being oper-ated under stressed conditions, which impose threat to voltage stability due to low voltages. Hence, the voltage stability index is incorporated as an inequality constraint in the OPF problem. The proposed method uses L-index to assess how far is the system from voltage instability ( Kessel and Glavitch, 1986 ). 5.1.1. Case 1: the OPF with quadratic cost curve model
In this case the fuel cost characteristics for all generating units are modeled by quadratic functions given by f  X  a i  X  b i P Gi  X  c i P 2 Gi unit.

The extendedobjectivefunctionincorporatingthe constraintsis given by OF  X   X  K q of load buses, nl is the number of transmission lines and x lim is the limit value of the dependent variable x given as x  X 
The minimum and maximum limits of real power generations and their cost coefficients are taken from Ongsakul and Tantimaporn (2006 ).
 The control parameter settings of EADDE algorithm are given in
Table A.1 . Table 3 gives the optimal set of evolved ant colony parameters. Results of OPF with quadratic fuel cost curves (case 1) for various EADDE control parameters and population sizes are given in Table 4 .
 The best control variables of OPF solution with F  X  0.5 and
CR  X  0.8 for population size of 50 for classical DE and for population sizes of 30, 40 and 50 for EADDE are given in Table 5 . The optimal fuel cost obtained by classical DE for case 1 is 800.5842$/h. The averagecostobtainedbytheEADDEforcase1is800.2412$/h,witha minimum cost of 800.2041$/h and a maximum cost of 800.2784$/h.
Note also that all control and state variables remained within their permissible limits. Fig. 1 shows the comparison of convergence characteristics of fuel cost of both basic DE and EADDE. The CPU times taken per generation for DE and EADDE algorithms for case 1 are given in Table 5 . The DE algorithm is tested with population sizes of 60 and 70 and the best costs obtained after 20 trial runs are 800.4883 and 800.4263$/h, respectively. The costs of DE are higher even with larger population sizes. It is quite clear that EADDE gives better results compared to DE. 5.1.2. Case 2: the OPF with piecewise quadratic cost curve model
The fuel cost characteristics for the generating units connected at busses 1 and 2 are now represented by a piecewise quadratic function to model different fuels given by f i  X  P i  X  X  with fuel type m .
 from Ongsakul and Tantimaporn (2006 ).

The control parameter settings of EADDE algorithm in this case are also given in Table A.1. Table 6 gives the optimal set of evolved ant colony parameters for case 2. Results of OPF with piecewise quadratic fuel cost (case 2) for various EADDE control parameters and population sizes are given in Table 7 .

The best control variables of OPF solution (case 2) with F  X  0.5 and CR  X  0.8 for population size 50 for classical DE and for population sizes 30, 40 and 50 for EADDE are given in Table 8 .
The optimal fuel cost obtained by classical DE for case 2 is 630.8928$/h. The average cost obtained by EADDE for case 2 is 629.8517$/h, with a minimum cost of 629.7223$/h and a maximum cost of 629.9706 $/h. It can be observed that the EADDE provides and state variables remained within their permissible limits. Fig. 2 shows the comparison of convergence characteristics of fuel cost of both basic DE and EADDE. The CPU times taken per generation for DE and EADDE algorithms for case 2 are given in Table 8 . 5.1.3. Case3:theOPFwithquadraticcostcurvewithvalvepointloadings
In this case a sine component is added to the cost curves of the generating units at buses 1 and 2 to reflect the valve point loading effects given by IEEE Committee Report (1971 ): f  X  a generating unit.

The fuel cost function is augmented with the constraints and is given by OF  X   X  k q The cost coefficients for the first two generators are taken from Ongsakul and Tantimaporn (2006 ).

The fitness function used in the above three cases is given by f  X  1 = OF  X  36  X  where OF is the augmented objective function given in the above three cases.

The control parameter settings of EADDE algorithm in this case are also given in Table A.1 . Table 9 gives the optimal set of evolved ant colony parameters for case 3. Results of OPF with quadratic fuel cost with valve point loading (case 3) for various EADDE control parameters and population sizes are given in Table 10 .
The best control variables of OPF solution (case 3) with F  X  0.5 and CR  X  0.8 for population size 50 for classical DE and for population sizes 30, 40 and 50 for EADDE are given in Table 11 .
The optimal fuel cost obtained by EADDE for case 2 is 930.7459$/h, whereas for classical differential evolution the fuel cost is 934.6909$/h. The average cost obtained by EADDE for case 3 is 930.8156 $/h, with a minimum cost of 930.7459$/h and a max-imum cost of 930.9344$/h. Note also that all control and state variables remained within their permissible limits. Fig. 3 shows the comparison of convergence characteristics of fuel cost of both basic
DE and EADDE. It is quite clear that EADDE gives the better results compared to DE in case 3 also. The CPU times taken per generation for DE and EADDE algorithms for case 3 are given in Table 11 . Fuel Cost ($/h) the optimal settings for F and CR are found to be 0.5 and 0.8, respectively. In these simulations it is observed that if F is greater than 0.5, worse results are obtained. For higher CR also better results are not obtained. Table 12 gives the comparison of the proposed EADDE approach with classical DE and other methods reported in the literature. Results clearly show the superiority of
EADDE over other methods. Fig. 4 shows the statistical evaluation of the mutation operator selection in all the three cases.
Abido (2002) , Abou El Ela et al. (2009) and Abou El Ela et al. (2010) are not considered for comparison in Table 9 .In Roa-Sepulveda and
Pavez-Lazo(2003 ),thoughcostforcase1was799.45$/h,thesumof real power generations was given as 278.58 MW and real power loss was 9.2 MW whereas load was 283.4 MW. So, power genera-tion is not matching load plus losses. Also, the load bus voltage limits are taken to be 0.9 X 1.1 p.u. In Abido (2002 ), there was a reactive power generation limit violation by 1.66 MVAR for case 1 and line flow (1 X 2) limit violation by 4.1% for case 3 ( Sayah and Zehar, 2008 ). In Abou El Ela et al. (2009) and Abou
El Ela et al. (2010 ), though cost for case 1 was 799.2891$/h, there were load bus voltage violations. For load buses 3 and 12, the voltages obtained were at 1.08 p.u. At many other load buses, the voltageswere up to1.06 and1.07 p.u. (Thiscan be observedin Fig.4 of Abou El Ela et al. (2009 )). The fuel cost obtained by EADDE is 799.0546 when the algorithm was run with load bus voltage maximum limit 1.08 p.u. Also, the CPU time per generation for this case for EADDE for a population size of 50 is 3.39 s. The CPU time per generation for the algorithm in Abou El Ela et al. (2009) and
AbouElElaetal.(2010) forthesamepopulationsizeis6.55 s.Thisis almost two times that of EADDE algorithm. This clearly shows that
EADDE clearly outperforms the algorithm in Abou El Ela et al. (2009) and Abou El Ela et al. (2010) in terms of both fuel cost and
CPU time. In the results presented by the same author in Abido (2002 ), the load bus voltages were within limit (i.e. 1.05 p.u.). Due tothisreason,EADDEalgorithm iscompared with Abido (2002 )only and not compared with AbouEl Ela et al.(2009) and Abou ElEla etal. (2010) in Table 12 . For IEEE 30-bus system, the load bus voltage maximum limit is 1.05 p.u. only. 5.2. IEEE 57-bus system
The standard IEEE 57-bus test system consists of seven generating units interconnected with 80 bran ches of a transmission network with a total load of 1250.8 MW and 336.4 MVAR. The bus data and the branchdataaretakenfrom MATPOWER .Inthissystemtherearethree shunt capacitors banks. In this case study, bus 1 is considered as the swingbus.Thecostcoefficientsandmaximumandminimumlimitsof real power generations are taken from MATPOWER. The maximum and minimum values for the generator voltage and tap changing
The minimum and maximum values of shunt reactive power injec-tions are 0.0 and 0.3 in per unit, respectively. The maximum and minimumvoltagesfortheloadbusesareconsideredtobe1.06and 0.94 in per unit from MATPOWER, respectively. The voltage stability indexisconsideredfrom Kessel and Glavitch (1986 ).

In this simulation study, minimization of different objectives under different cases is considered to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The objective functions taken into considera-tion are quadratic fuel cost, quadratic fuel cost with voltage stability enhancement and quadratic fuel cost with voltage profile improvement (voltage deviation). All the objective functions are augmented with the equality and inequality constraints. In each case study, 20 test runs were performed for solving the
OPF problem using the EADDE algorithm. Population size is taken to be 50 and maximum number of generations is 150. The control parameter settings of EADDE algorithm for IEEE 57 bus system are given in Table A.2 . 5.2.1. Case 1: the OPF with quadratic cost curve
The objective function is f  X  5.2.2. Case 2: the OPF with quadratic cost curve with voltage stability enhancement
The objective function is f  X  where k vs is the penalty factor for the voltage stability index and L max is the maximum of all voltage stability indices. 5.2.3. Case 3: the OPF with quadratic cost curve with voltage profile improvement
The objective function is f  X  where k vp is the penalty factor for the voltage profile improvement and NL is the number of load buses.
 Table 13 gives the optimal set of evolved ant colony parameters. The control variables of OPF solution are given in Table 14 . Comparison of objectives in the three cases with base-case and MATPOWER is given in Table 15 . The optimal fuel cost obtained by EADDE for case 1 is 41713.62$/h, for case 2 is 41972.45$/h and for frequency of selection case 3 is 42051.44$/h. Note also that all control and state variables remained within their permissible limits.

Fig. 5 shows the comparison of convergence characteristics of fuel cost of EADDE for all the three cases. For IEEE 57 bus system also, the mutation constant and crossover constant are taken as 0.5 and 0.8, respectively, which are the optimal settings determined from simulation of IEEE 30 bus system. Fig. 6 shows the statistical evaluation of the mutation operator selection in all the three cases. 6. Conclusion
Inthispaper,anovelevolvingantdirectiondifferentialevolution (EADDE) approach has been presented for solving the OPF problem with non-smooth and non-convex generator fuel cost curves with different inequality constraints. The EADDE algorithm effectively solves the OPF problem in all the three cases namely quadratic fuel cost, piecewise quadratic cost and quadratic cost with valve point loading. The robustness of EADDE has been demonstrated for different control parameter settings and for different population sizes. The results clearly indicate that better solutions are obtained using this approach when compared with other methods reported in the literature. Comparison shows that EADDE outperforms other techniques when its parameters are properly tuned. Simulation results show that the EADDEissuperior to the original DE algorithm with regard to the convergence to the global optimum.

The proposed approach has been successfully and effectively implemented to find the optimal settings of the control variables of the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus test systems.
