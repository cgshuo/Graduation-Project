 In trans-lingual language processing tasks, such as machine translation and cross-lingual informa-tion retrieval, named entity (NE) translation is essential. Bilingual NE alignment, which links source NEs and target NEs, is the first step to train the NE translation model. 
Since NE alignment can only be conducted af-ter its associated NEs have first been identified, the including-rate of the first recognition stage significantly limits the final alignment perform-ance. To alleviate the above error accumulation problem, two strategies have been proposed in the literature. The first strategy (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Moore, 2003; Feng et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2006) identifies NEs only on the source side and then finds their corresponding NEs on the target side. In this way, it avoids the NE recognition errors which would otherwise be brought into the alignment stage from the target side; however, the NE errors from the source side still remain. 
To further reduce the errors from the source side, the second strategy (Huang et al., 2003) expands the NE candidate-sets in both languages before conducting the alignment, which is done by treating the original results as anchors, and then re-generating further candidates by enlarg-ing or shrinking those anchors' boundaries. Of course, this strategy will be in vain if the NE an-chor is missed in the initial detection stage. In our data-set, this strategy significantly raises the NE-pair type-insensitive including-rate 1 from 83.9% to 96.1%, and is thus adopted in this paper. 
Although the above expansion strategy has substantially alleviated the error accumulation problem, the final alignment accuracy is still not good (type-sensitive F-score only 68.4%, as indi-cated in Table 2 in Section 4.2). After having examined the data, we found that: (1) How a given NE is translated, either semantically (called translation ) or phonetically (called trans-literation ), depends greatly on its associated en-tity type 2 . The mapping type ratio , which is the percentage of NE internal tokens which are translated semantically, can help with the recog-nition of the associated NE type; (2) Entities within an aligned pair sh ould share the same type, and this restriction should be integrated into NE alignment as a constraint; (3) Those initially identified monolingual NEs can act as anchors to give monolingual candidate certainty scores (preference weightings) fo r the re-generated can-didates. 
Based on the above observation, a new joint model which adopts the mapping type ratio , en-forces the entity type consistency constraint, and also utilizes the monolingual candidate certainty factors is proposed in this paper to jointly iden-tify and align bilingual NEs under an integrated framework. This framework is decomposed into three subtasks: Initial Detection , Expansion , and Alignment&amp;Re-identification . The Initial Detec-tion subtask first locates the initial NEs and their associated NE types insi de both the Chinese and English sides. Afterwards, the Expansion subtask re-generates the candidate-sets in both languages to recover those initial NE recognition errors. Finally, the Alignment&amp;Re-identification subtask jointly recognizes and aligns bilingual NEs via the proposed joint model presented in Section 3. With this new approach, 41.8% imperfection re-duction in type-sensitive F-score, from 68.4% to 81.6%, has been observed in our Chinese-English NE alignment task. The problem of NE recognition requires both boundary identification and type classification. However, the complexity of these tasks varies with different languages. For example, Chinese NE boundaries are especially difficult to identify because Chinese is not a tokenized language. In contrast, English NE boundaries are easier to identify due to capitalizati on clues. On the other hand, classification of English NE types can be more challenging (Ji et al., 2006). Since align-ment would force the linked NE pair to share the same semantic meaning, the NE that is more re-liably identified in one language can be used to ensure its counterpart in another language. This benefits both the NE boundary identification and type classification process es, and it hints that alignment can help to re-identify those initially recognized NEs which had been less reliable. 
As shown in the following example, although the desired NE  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  is recognized partially as  X   X  X  X  X  X   X  in the initial recognition stage, it would be more preferred if its English counterpart  X  X orth Korean's Central News Agency X  is given. The reason for this is that  X  X ews Agency X  would prefer to be linked to  X   X   X  X  X   X , rather than to be deleted (which would happen if  X   X  X  X  X  X   X  is chosen as the corre-sponding Chinese NE). As another example, the word  X  X ake X  in the English NE is linked to the Chinese character  X   X   X  as illustrated below, and this mapping is found to be a translation and not a transliteration. Since translation rarely occurs for personal names (Chen et al., 2003), the desired NE type  X  X OC X  would be preferred to be shared between the English NE  X  X ake Constance X  and its corre-sponding Chinese NE  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X . As a result, the original incorrect type  X  X ER X  of the given English NE is fixed, and the necessity of using mapping type ratio and NE type consistency con-straint becomes evident. As mentioned in the introduction section, given a Chinese-English sentence-pair (, , with its original NE types assigned to and , respectively ), we will first re-generate two NE candidate-sets from them by enlarging and shrinking the boundaries of those initially recog-nized NEs. Let these two re-generated candidate sets for Chi-nese and English NEs respectively ( K and are their set-sizes), and  X   X  min , K ST  X  , then a total K pairs of final Chinese and English NEs will be picked up from the Cartesian product of ated linking score , which is defined as follows. 
Let denote the asso-ciated linking score for a given candidate-pair the associat ed indexes of the re-generated Chi-nese and English NE candidates, respectively. Furthermore, let be the NE type to be re -assigned and shared by RCNE and (as they pos sess the same meaning). Assume that and are derived from ini-tially recogni zed and , respectively, and ping , to be defined in Section 3.1, then
Here, the  X  X ax X  operator varies over each possible internal component mapping re-assigned type (PER, LOC, and ORG). For brevity, we will drop those associated subscripts from now on, if there is no confusion. 
The associated probability factors in the above linking score can be further derived as follows. gual A lignment Factor and the Bilingual Type Re-assignment Factor respectively, to represent the bilingual related scores (Section 3.1). Also, gual Candidate Certainty Factors (Section 3.2) used to assign preference to each selected and , based on the initially recognized NEs (which a ct as anchors). 3.1 Bilingual Related Factors The bilingu al alignment factor mainly represents the likelihood value of a specific internal com-ponent mapping NE configurations RCNE and and their associat ed . Since Chinese word segmen-tation is problematic, especially for transliterated words, the bilingual alignment factor 
P M RT ype R NE in Eq (2) is derived to be conditioned on RE (i.e., starting from the English part). We define the internal com ponent mapping 
M to be where denotes a linked pair consisting o f a Chinese component (which might contain several Chinese characters) and an English word within and type [, as TS ) or transliteration (abbreviated as TL ). In total, there are N component mappings, with and transliteration mappings cpn
Moreover, since the mapping type distribu-tions of various NE types deviate greatly from one another, as illustrated in the second footnote, the associated mapping type ratio  X   X  / thus an important feature, and is included in the internal component mapping configuration speci-fied above. For example, the  X  X  X  X   X  and  X  X onstance Lake X  is [  X  X  X  X  X  X , Constance , TL ] and [  X , Lake , TS ], so its asso-ciated mapping type ratio will be  X 0.5 X  (i.e., 1/2). troducing the internal mapping type the mapping type ratio  X  as follows: P M RType RENE  X   X   X  X 
In the above equation, the mappings between internal components are trained from the sylla-ble/word alignment of NE pairs of different NE types. In more detail  X  for transliteration, the model adopted in (Huang et al., 2003), which first Romanizes Chinese characters and then transliterates them into English characters, is used for . For transla-tion, condi tional probability is directly used for 
Lastly , the bilingual type re-assignment factor Eq (2) is derived as follows: 
As Eq (4) shows, both the Chinese initial NE type and English initial NE type are adopted to jointly identify their shared NE type R Type . 3.2 Monolingual Candidate Certainty Factors On the other hand, the monolingual candidate certainty factors in Eq (2) indicate the likelihood that a re-generated NE candidate is the true NE given its originally detected NE. For Chinese, it is derived as follows: 
Where, the subscript C denotes Chinese, and Chinese NE CN . and denote the left and right distance (which are the numbers of Chinese characters) that R shrinks/enlarges from the left and right boundary of its anchor assu me that CN and are  X   X  X  X  X  X   X  and  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  respectively, Le and stands for the associat ed Chinese string of , that string, and cc Chinese characters within . RCNE
On the English side, following Eq (5), similarly, except that Le and will be m easured in number of English words. For in-stance, with EN and as  X  Lake Con-stance  X  and  X  on Lake Constance  X  respectively, the bigram unit of the Chinese NE string is replaced by the English word unit . 
All the bili ngual and monolingual factors mentioned above, which are derived from Eq (1), are weighted differently according to their con-tributions. The corresponding weighting coeffi-cients are obtained using the well-known Mini-mum Error Rate Training (Och, 2003; com-monly abbreviated as MERT) algorithm by minimizing the number of associated errors in the development set. 3.3 Framework for the Proposed Model The above model is implemented with a three-stage framework: (A) Initial NE Recognition; (B) NE-Candidate-Set Expansion; and (C) NE Alignment&amp;Re-identification. The Following Diagram gives the details of this framework: 
For each given bilingual sentence-pair: (A) Initial NE Recognition: generates the ini-(B) NE-Candidate-Set Expansion: For each (C) NE Alignment&amp;Re-identification: Rank Diagram 1. Steps to Generate the Final NE-Pairs 
It is our observation that, four Chinese charac-ters for both shrinking and enlarging, two Eng-lish words for shrinking and three for enlarging are enough in most cases. Under these conditions, the including-rates for NEs with correct bounda-ries are raised to 95.8% for Chinese and 97.4% for English; and even the NE-pair including rate is raised to 95.3%. Since the above range limita-tion setting has an including-rate only 0.8% lower than that can be obtained without any range limitation (which is 96.1%), it is adopted in this paper to greatly reduce the number of NE-pair-candidates. To evaluate the proposed joint approach, a prior work (Huang et al., 2003) is re-implemented in our environment as the baseline, in which the translation cost, transliteration cost and tagging cost are used. This model is selected for com-parison because it not only adopts the same can-didate-set expansion strate gy as mentioned above, but also utilizes the monolingual information when selecting NE-pairs (however, only a simple bi-gram model is used as the tagging cost in their paper). Note that it enforces the same NE type only when the tagging cost is evaluated: 
To give a fairer comparison, the same train-ing-set and testing-set are adopted. The training-set includes two parts. The first part consists of 90,412 aligned sentence-pairs newswire data from the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), which is denoted as Training-Set-I. The second Part of the training set is the LDC2005T34 bilingual NE dictionary 3 , which is denoted as Training-Set-II. The required feature information is then manually labeled throughout the two training sets. 
In our experiments, for the baseline system, the translation cost and the transliteration cost are trained on Training-Set-II, while the tagging cost is trained on Training-Set-I. For the pro-posed approach, the monolingual candidate cer-tainty factors are trained on Training-Set-I, and Training-Set-II is used to train the parameters relating to bilingual alignment factors. 
For the testing-set, 300 sentence pairs are ran-domly selected from the LDC Chinese-English News Text (LDC2005T06). The average length of the Chinese sentences is 59.4 characters, while the average length of the English sentences is 24.8 words. Afterwards, the answer keys for NE recognition and alignment were annotated manu-ally, and used as the gold standard to calculate metrics of precision (P), recall (R), and F-score (F) for both NE recognition (NER) and NE alignment (NEA). In Total 765 Chinese NEs and 747 English NEs were manually labeled in the testing-set, within which there are only 718 NE pairs, including 214 PER, 371 LOC and 133 ORG NE-pairs. The number of NE pairs is less than that of NEs, because not all those recog-nized NEs can be aligned. 
Besides, the development-set for MERT weight training is composed of 200 sentence pairs selected from the LDC2005T06 corpus, which includes 482 manually tagged NE pairs. There is no overlap between the training-sets, the development-set and the testing-set. 4.1 Baseline System Both the baseline and the proposed models share the same initial detection subtask, which adopts the Chinese NE recognizer reported by Wu et al. (2005), which is a hybrid statistical model incor-porating multi-knowledge sources, and the Eng-lish NE recognizer included in the publicly available Mallet toolkit 4 to generate initial NEs. Initial Chinese NEs and English NEs are recog-nized by these two ava ilable packages respec-tively. 
Table 1 shows the initial NE recognition per-formances for both Chinese and English (the largest entry in each column is highlighted for visibility). From Table 1, it is observed that the F-score of ORG type is the lowest among all NE types for both English and Chinese. This is be-cause many organization names are partially rec-ognized or missed. Besides, not shown in the table, the location names or abbreviated organi-zation names tend to be incorrectly recognized as person names. In general, the initial Chinese NER outperforms the initial English NER, as the NE type classification turns out to be a more dif-ficult problem for this English NER system. 
When those initially identified NEs are di-rectly used for baseline alignment, only 64.1% F score (regard of their name types) is obtained. Such a low performance is mainly due to those NE recognition errors which have been brought into the alignment stage. 
To diminish the effect of errors accumulating, which stems from the recognition stage, the base-line system also adopts th e same expansion strat-egy described in Section 3.3 to enlarge the possi-ble NE candidate set. However, only a slight im-provement (68.4% type-sensitive F-score) is ob-tained, as shown in Table 2. Therefore, it is con-jectured that the baseline alignment model is un-able to achieve good performance if those fea-tures/factors proposed in this paper are not adopted. 4.2 The Recognition and Alignment Joint To show the individual effect of each factor in the joint model, a series of experiments, from Exp0 to Exp11, are conducted. Exp0 is the basic system , which ignores monolingual candidate certainty scores, and also disregards mapping type and NE type consistency constraint by ig-noring and and also replacing P with in Eq (3). 
To show the effect of enforcing NE type con-sistency constraint on internal component map-ping, Exp1 (named Exp0+RType ) replaces (nam ed Exp0+MappingType ) shows the effect of introducing the component mapping type to Eq (3) by replacing in Exp0 by Exp3 (nam ed Exp2+MappingTypeRatio ) further adds tribution from the mapping type ratio. In addition, Exp4 (named Exp0+RTypeReassignment ) adds the NE type reassignment score, Eq (4), to Exp0 to show the effect of enforcing NE-type consis-tency. Furthermore, Exp5 (named All-BiFactors ) shows the full power of the set of proposed bi-lingual factors by turning on all the options men-tioned above. As the bilingual alignment factors would favor the candidate s with shorter lengths, is further normalized into the following form: and is shown by Exp6 (named All-N-BiFactors ). 
To show the influence of additional informa-tion carried by those initially recognized NEs, Exp7 (named Exp6+LeftD/RightD ) adds left and right distance information into Exp6, as that specified in Eq (5). To study the monolingual bi-gram capability, Exp8 (named Exp6+Bigram ) adds the NEtype dependant bigram model of each language to Exp6. We use SRI Language Modeling Toolkit 5 (SRILM) (Stolcke, 2002) to train various character/word based bi-gram mod-els with different NE types. Similar to what we have done on the bilingual alignment factor above, Exp9 (named Exp6+N-Bigram ) adds the normalized NEtype dependant bigram to Exp6 for removing the bias induced by having differ-ent NE lengths. The normalized Chinese NEtype dependant bigram score is defined as  X  . A Similar trans-formation is also applie d to the English side. 
Lastly, Exp10 (named Fully-JointModel ) shows the full power of the proposed Recogni-tion and Alignment Joint Model by adopting all the normalized factors mentioned above. The result of a MERT weighted version is further shown by Exp11 (named Weighted-JointModel ). Table 2. NEA Type-Insensitive (Type-Sensitive) 
Since most papers in the literature are evalu-ated only based on the boundaries of NEs, two kinds of performance are thus given here. The first one (named type-insensitive) only checks the scope of each NE without taking its associ-ated NE type into consideration, and is reported as the main data at Table 2. The second one (named type-sensitive) would also evaluate the associated NE type of each NE, and is given within parentheses in Table 2. A large degrada-tion is observed when NE type is also taken into account. The highlighted entries are those that are statistically better 6 than that of the baseline system. 4.3 ME Approach with Primitive Features Although the proposed model has been derived above in a principled way, since all these pro-posed features can also be directly integrated with the well-known maximum entropy (ME) (Berger et al., 1996) framework without making any assumptions, one might wonder if it is still worth to deriving a model after all the related features have been proposed. To show that not only the features but also the adopted model con-tribute to the performance improvement, an ME approach is tested as follows for comparison. It directly adopts all those primitive features men-tioned above as its inputs (including internal component mapping, initial and final NE type, NE bigram-based string, and left/right distance), without involving any related probability factors derived within the proposed model. 
This ME method is implemented with a public package YASMET 7 , and is tested under various training-set sizes (400, 4,000, 40,000, and 90,412 sentence-pairs). All those training-sets are ex-tracted from the Training-Set-I mentioned above (a total of 298,302 NE pairs included are manu-ally labeled). Since the ME approach is unable to utilize the bilingual NE dictionary (Training-Set-II), for fair comparison, this dictionary was also not used to train our models here. Table 3 shows the performance (F-score) using the same test-ing-set. The data within parentheses are relative improvements. 
The improvement indicated in Table 3 clearly illustrates the benefit of deriving the model shown in Eq (2). Since a reasonably derived model not only shares the same training-set with the primitive ME version above, but also enjoys the additional knowledge introduced by the hu-man (i.e., the assumptions/constraints implied by the model), it is not surprising to find out that a good model does help, and that it also becomes more noticeable as the training-set gets smaller. Although the proposed model has substantially improved the performance of both NE alignment and recognition, some errors still remain. Having examined those type-insensitive errors, we found that they can be classified into four categories: (A) Original NEs or their components are al-ready not one-to-one mapped (23%). (B) NE components are one-to-one linked, but the asso-ciated NE anchors generated from the initial rec-ognition stage are either missing or spurious (24%). Although increasing the number of output candidates generated from the initial recognition stage might cover the missing problem, possible side effects might also be expected (as the com-plexity of the alignment task would also be in-creased). (C) Mapping types are not assumed by the model (27%). For example, one NE is abbre-viated while its counterpart is not; or some loan-words or out-of-vocabulary terms are translated neither semantically nor phonetically. (D) Wrong NE scopes are selected (26%). Errors of this type are uneasy to resolve, and their possible solutions are beyond the scope of this paper. 
Examples of above category (C) are interest-ing and are further illustrated as follows. As an instance of abbreviation errors, a Chinese NE  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (GlaxoSmithKline Factory) X  is tagged as  X   X  X  X  X  /PRR  X  X  X  X  /n X , while its counterpart in the English side is simply abbrevi-ated as  X  X SK X  (or replaced by a pronoun  X  X t X  sometimes). Linking  X   X  X  X  X   X  to  X  X SK X  (or to the pronoun  X  X t X ) is thus out of reach of our model. It seems an abbreviation table (or even anaphora analysis) is required to recover these kind of errors. 
As an example of errors resulting from loan-words; Japanese kanji  X   X  X  X   X  (the name of a Japanese emperor) is linked to the English word  X  X kihito X . Here the Japanese kanji  X   X  X  X   X  is di-rectly adopted as the corresponding Chinese characters (as those characters were originally borrowed from Chinese), which would be pro-nounced as  X  X ingren X  in Chinese and thus devi-ates greatly from the English pronunciation of  X  X kihito X . Therefore, it is translated neither se-mantically nor phonetically. Further extending the model to cover this new conversion type seems necessary; however, such a kind of exten-sion is very likely to be language pair dependent. In addition to improving NE alignment, the pro-posed joint model can also boost the perform-ance of NE recognition in both languages. The corresponding differences in performance (of the weighted version) when compared with the ini-tial NER ( , and P  X  R  X  F  X  ) are shown in Table 4. Again, those marked entries indicate that they are statistically better than that of the original NER. Table 4. Improvement in Chinese/English NER 
The result shows that the proposed joint model has a clear win over the initial NER for either Chinese or English NER. In particular, ORG seems to have yielded the greatest gain amongst NE types, which matches our previous observa-tions that the boundaries of Chinese ORG are difficult to identify with the information only coming from the Chinese sentence, while the type of English ORG is uneasy to classify with the information only coming from the English sentence. 
Though not shown in the tables, it is also ob-served that the proposed approach achieves a 28.9% reduction on the spurious (false positive) and partial tags over the initial Chinese NER, as well as 16.1% relative error reduction compared with the initial English NER. In addition, total 27.2% wrong Chinese NEs and 40.7% wrong English NEs are corrected into right NE types. However, if the mapping type ratio is omitted, only 21.1% wrong Chinese NE types and 34.8% wrong English NE types can be corrected. This clearly indicates that the ratio is essential for identifying NE types. 
With the benefits shown above, the alignment model could thus be used to train the monolin-gual NE recognition model via semi-supervised learning. This advantage is important for updat-ing the NER model from time to time, as various domains frequently have different sets of NEs and new NEs also emerge with time. 
Since the Chinese NE recognizer we use is not an open source toolkit, it cannot be used to carry out semi-supervised learning. Therefore, only the English NE recognizer and the alignment model are updated during training iterations. In our ex-periments, 50,412 sentence pairs are first ex-tracted from Training-Set-I as unlabeled data. Various labeled data-sets are then extracted from the remaining data as different seed corpora (100, 400, 4,000 and 40,000 sentence-pairs). Table 5 shows the results of semi-supervised learning after convergence for adopting only the English NER model ( NER-Only ), the baseline alignment model ( NER+Baseline ), and our un-weighted joint model ( NER+JointModel ) respectively. The Initial-NER row indicates the initial performance of the NER model re-trained from different seed corpora. The data within parentheses are relative improvement over Initial-NER . Note that the testing set is still the same as before. 
As Table 5 shows, with the NER model alone, the performance may even deteriorate after con-vergence. This is due to the fact that maximizing likelihood does not imply minimizing the error rate. However, with additional mapping con-straints from the aligned sentence of another lan-guage, the alignment module could guide the searching process to converge to a more desir-able point in the parameter space; and these addi-tional constraints become more effective as the seed-corpus gets smaller. 
Supervised Learning of English NE Recognition In summary, our experiments show that the new monolingual candidate certainty factors are more effective than the tagging cost (only bigram model) adopted in the baseline system. Moreover, both the mapping type ratio and the entity type consistency constraint are very helpful in identi-fying the associated NE boundaries and types. After having adopted the features and enforced the constraint mentioned above, the proposed framework, which jointly recognizes and aligns bilingual named entities, achieves a remarkable 42.1% imperfection reduc tion on type-sensitive F-score (from 68.4% to 81.7%) in our Chinese-English NE alignment task. 
Although the experiments are conducted on the Chinese-English language pair, it is expected that the proposed approach can also be applied to other language pairs, as no language dependent linguistic feature (or knowledge) is adopted in the model/algorithm used.
