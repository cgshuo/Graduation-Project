 Innovation spirit is not only an important quality for scholars, but also a key factor to order to stimulate their inspirations, and prefer to attend highly innovative confe-awards such as  X  X IGMOD Edgar F. Codd Innovations Award X  in Database Systems domain also proves that people are becoming more and more concerned about innova-tion quality. With expecting to propose an innovation ranking criterion, there are several questions need to be discussed beforehand: (1) What is the Definition of Innovation? something or add some value. (2) Why do We Evaluate Innovation Quality Based on Terms? Generally speaking, the only possible way to judge innovation quality of conferences and scholars automatically is by evaluating their research products -publications. All of their innovation quality and contribution to respective research field. The classical tries to evaluate the value of a publicatio n according to its quotation rate. The higher of the publication X  X  quotation rate, the higher of its value. 
Different publications have different innovation points. Some may propose new theories or algorithms; others may point out new directions or develop new systems. Apparently, it is impossible to set up a perfectly fair criterion to evaluate the innova-tion quality of publications. However, we can use some reasonable ways to approach found out that most of the time a new-born innovative idea (including new theory or technology, new algorithm, fresh topic, rising direction and so forth) has always been that every domain term represents a new inno vative idea; therefore, it is a reasonable way to evaluate the innovation ability of a research individual or institution by mining new domain terms proposed by its publications. (3) How to Evaluate Innovation of publication by Terms? can get a high mark for its great influence to others. We use the same strategy in our term-based criterion: We introduce a new factor into our ranking scheme, which we call In novation F actor (or InF for simplicity). If a new term proposed by a publication which becomes a popular topic or direction later, then this publication deserves a high InF score since it was not only once a fresh idea but also a successful leader to a new section 3. (4) Where to Get Authentic Domain Terms? A good domain term set which should contain nearly all the authentic terms in a cer-from keywords and general terms of publications in a domain, but also extract terms from session names of some famous conferences using a hybrid method of statistical this part will be given in section 4. After we know how to do InF scoring, an innovation ranking system which we call IRank (Term-based I nnovation Rank ing System for Conferences and Scholars) is developed to rank conferences and scholars in the field of Database System . 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews some related works in history. In Section 3 we will explain how to do InF scoring. Our method to Section 6 evaluates the results of IRank . Finally we make a conclusion in Section 7. more and more on citation-based statistics as a tool for evaluating the research quality Journal Impact Factor (JIF) [5] was proposed firstly to rate scientific journals in 1963, it has been widely applied in various fields including CS (Computer Science). There have been some computer science conference ranking reports such as the NUS 1999 report on CS conference rankings (We will call it NUSRank in the rest of this paper) [6] and CS conference ranking based on Estimated Impact of Conference (EIC) [7] as shown in Fig. 1 below: 
However, JIF can be misleading [8]. Someone has proposed that we should judge a paper by the number of citations the paper itself receives [9], but it may take decades ultimate impact of a paper [10]. Lately, in [11] its authors have developed a model to journal, and then proposed a journal-ranking scheme that maximizes the efficiency of locating high impact research. them are based on information retrieval methods for term indexing [12], but many oth-ers [13, 14 and 15] also take inspiration from terminology and NLP research. Term noun phrases that may express terms by phrase analysis. The state-of-the-art is mostly to run a part-of-speech tagger over the domain corpus used for the ontology learning task whereas more advanced approaches to term extraction for ontology learning build on deeper linguistic analysis as discussed above [18, 19]. Additionally, in order to identify thods, which use linguistic rules to extra term candidates combining with statistical (pre-or post-) filtering. In fact, the algorithm we propose in this paper to extract terms from session names in proceedings is also a hybrid method. We not only combine linguistic algorithm for term extraction from them is given in section 4. they used; accordingly we can calculate InF score for scholars and conferences which all the necessary domain terms appeared in history. For a publication, there might be several terms used in it, each of which will denote a value to its innovation score. 3.1 Weight and Value of Term velopment of certain domain. In the classical citation-based ranking scheme, paper same principle in valuing terms. A term with a higher appearance frequency in publi-appear in a session name since session name is given by experts of a certain domain which represents important research directions in this domain. Therefore terms appeared in session names are more valuable than other terms. times in session names in history, then the weight of t can be represented by: f , which enhances the weight of f  X  X  in the meantime. Term Value: As the time passes by, the innovation value of a term t is reducing at an exponential rate. Since different terms have different attenuation speed, so we consid-has been appearing for y years after it was born. Fig. 2 depicts the attenuation trend of the function below. born until the latest year in which t appears more than a threshold (We use 2 in our experiments). 3.2 InF Scoring for Publications As we know, a publication may mention dozens of terms at a time, each of which values, it is convenient to evaluate the innovation value of publications. 
For a publication p published in the year  X   X  , if we use  X  X  X  X  X  to represent the set of terms appeared in p , then its innovation value can be calculated as: 
In this function,  X  denotes a term in  X  X  X  X  X  ;  X   X  represent the year in which the term  X  was born. 3.3 Evaluation of Conference a nd Scholars rences and scholars. In fact, we define two InF scores for each conference and author. 1. Tc-InF Score: Tc-InF Score is the standard according to which we rank conferences and scholars for their T otal C ontribution to the innovation development of a domain. Tc-InF score of a posed by this conference or author, which is given in the formula (4). 
T(c_s) is a set of terms first proposed by the conference or scholar c_s. 2. Aiq-InF Score: As we know, different conferences and scholars are different in publication quantity. Maybe someone only published several publications but all of which are high-quality define this Aiq-InF score to evaluate the A verage I nnovation Q uality of conference or scholars X  publications. The Aiq-Inf score of a conference or a scholar c_s can be calculated by formula (5): 
In this function,  X   X   X _ X   X  represents the publication set of a conference or scholar c_s . In Section 4 we assume that we have already had a good enough term set, however, it of the domain terms we have ever used in a domain. 4.1 How to Get Domain Terms In order to get a good domain set and later find out those terms X  appearance locations in history, we have to collect information (including paper title, keywords, abstract) of nearly all the publications which have ever been published in famous international conferences of the domain. Our domain terms can be gotten from those keywords as well as session names of famous international conferences. Different from keywords, a session name may constructed by several terms in a special form. Following exam-ples listed some session names from domains  X  X atabases X  and  X  X ata Mining X : Example 1 : Query Processing Example 2 : Data Warehousing and Data Mining Example 3 : AI and Knowledge-Based Systems  X  Reasoning 
In fact, except for some meaningless ones, there are mainly three types of session names as shown above. Session names in example 1 are Single-term Session s, which only contain one domain term. Session names in example 2 and example 3 are Multi-term Session s, which are composed by several terms. Session names in example 2 names in example 3 must contain a dash ( X  X  X ). 
Term extraction strategy from a Single-term Session is very simple. But it is much most complicated situation we should dispose since they are composed by several concepts and we have no idea about their structures. Our method to dispose them will Therefore, we would dispose the two parts according to their forms respectively. 4.2 Term Extraction from Multi-term Session A multi-term session name in example 2 can be represented by: There are mainly three different types of structures: 
It is impossible to know the structure of each session name without knowing its one. Major steps of this algorithm are outlined below: names. Step 2: In the second step, we split each multi-term session of this domain in various ways. Assume we could get a phrase set C X   X  c  X  | i X 1,2,...n  X  each time we split it in a way. In order to get credit of each split method, we match c  X   X  X  X 1,2,...n X  to term in the candidate-term table. In this way we can get its frequency f X  X   X   X  in candidate-term table. So we calculate the credit of this split method by the following formula (7): F is a smoothing constant factor which is used to prevent zero probability). table until all multi-term session names have been disposed. But there are also some multi-term session names that we cannot determine how to split them since terms they kinds of problems: Zero-score Problem and Equal-score Problem . name in all possible ways, if all those splitting ways including the right one can only get zero score, we say a zero-score problem happens. Definition 4 (Equal-score Problem): When we are trying to split a multi-term session largest scores, we say an equal-score problem happens. above, we use text classification method to help splitting them properly in this step. 
As we discussed above, there are three structure types for each composition phrase, we can find out whether there are relationships between words used in a composition phrase from it. Major steps are given below: 1) Firstly, each time we split a phrase which doesn X  X  have zero-score or equal-score 2) Secondly, we can learn association rules from the date set. Each association rule 3) Finally, with all the association rules, we can establish our forecasting model which Step 4: After we split all session multi-term names, we have all candidate terms in the candidate-term table. Except for some stop words, we regard those candidate term whose frequency is larger than a threshold (we set 3) as formal domain terms. 
Of course, after we get all those terms, it is necessary to invite domain experts to have a judgment and selection to those terms. Our experiment in Database System names and keywords are qualified to use. For the left 30%, some of them are dropped for meaningless while others can become qualified after being modified. IRank has mainly three modules as shown in Fig. 3. 6.1 Comparison between Term-Based Ranking and Citation-Based Ranking Although the classical citation-based ranking scheme has been accepted as an au-thority rank for journals and conferences, it may not be proper to judge the innova-tion quality. Let X  X  take a look at an interesting example in Database System domain. According to the NUSRank, SIGMOD, VLDB, PODS and ICDE are rank one authoritative conferences which also proposed lots of new terms in history. But surprisingly, ER, DEXA which are only rank two conferences also have proposed lots of new terms, even more than PODS. Therefore, the citation-based ranking scheme can X  X  tell us everything about a conference such as innovation quality. A relative low authority conference or author can also be very creative and filled with innovation power. 
We think our term-based ranking scheme is better than citation-based ranking scheme in the following several aspects: 1) Term-based ranking scheme considers the innovation quality from the term-2) Citation-based ranking scheme cannot evaluate a newly published paper be-3) The reference of a paper can only lists some most relevant or most recently 4) The citation relationships are not always available especially when related to 6.2 Results Evaluation for IRank The comparison between our ranking results (only part of our results, we select some conferences in different levels) in Database Systems and the other two rankings: computer science conference ranking given by the NUS 1999 report on CS confe-rence rankings [6] and CS conference ranking based on Estimated Impact of Confe-aim at different purposes and base on different factors, they are similar in their rank-ing results. 
In order to further evaluate our results, we try to find out similarity between our re-sults and four SIGMOD awards. Those scholars who have ever received  X  X IGMOD Edgar F. Codd Innovations Award X  or  X  X IGMOD Contributions Award X  have excel-lent ranks (most of the 34 people are top 10%, even top 5%) in our ranking list, which proves that our method may provide a credible reference to the evaluation of research lished annually, those papers which have received  X  X IGMOD Best Paper Award X  and  X  X IGMOD Test of Time Award X  are always in the top 5% (sometimes even in top 1%) in our annual publication ranking. All these results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. which can be used to rank publications, conferences and scholars based on their inno-vative contributions. We make the observation that an innovative idea is mostly pre-effectiveness of our criterion. We think our term-based ranking scheme can be a good alternative scheme for the classical citation-based ranking scheme.
