 Keywords Distributed language resources Interoperable lexical resources Language services 1 Introduction Enhancing the development of language resources, lexical resources in particular, is of foremost importance for many applications to take off. Nevertheless, large-scale multilingual lexical resources are not as widely available and are very costly to construct: the work process for manual development of new lexical resources or for tailoring existing ones is too expensive in terms of effort and time to be practically attractive.

The previous trend in lexical resource development was oriented to building large-scale, general-purpose lexicons, assuming long-term projects and large financial and human resources. However, these lexical resources are not always satisfactory despite the tremendous amount of work needed to build them and the richness and degree of sophistication of the information contained therein. Often they are unbalanced with respect of the type of lexical information encoded, focusing on a particular type and not providing enough coverage of other aspects. In some other cases, they are too much or too little detailed for the specific purposes of applications. On the other hand, the market is increasingly calling for new types of lexical resources: lexicons that can be built rapidly, possibly by combining certain types of information while discarding others, and tailored to specific needs and requirements. In addition to building new lexical resources, the new trend focuses on trying to exploit the richness of existing lexicons.

To meet these requirements, lexical resources need to be made available to and be constantly accessed by different types of users, who may want to select different portions of the same resource or may need to combine information coming from different resources. This scenario no longer leaves space to static, closed, and locally managed repositories of lexical information; instead, it calls for an environment where lexical resources can be shared, are reusable, and are openly customizable. At the same time, as the history of the web teaches, it would be a mistake to create a central repository containing all the shared lexical resources, if only because of the difficulties to manage it. The key has been identified in the concept of distribution of lexical resources , and currently the solution being constantly proposed by the lexical resource community consists in moving towards distributed language services , based on open content interoperability standards, and made accessible to users via web-services technology.

The paradigm of distributed and interoperable lexical resources has largely been discussed and invoked. On the theoretical and representational side, substantial work has been and is being done to provide the community with abstract and standardized representations ensuring descriptive interoperability among different lexicons, most notably the work carried out in ISO/TC37/SC4 (ISO 24613 2008 ). On the other hand, efforts for the development of methods and techniques to concretely realize lexicon interoperability are much smaller in comparison. In most cases, the developed tools are intended for inter-lexica access, search and editing. This is the case, for instance, of the tools and facilities developed in the Balkanet project (Tufis 2004 ; Koutsoubos et al. 2004 ). An example of tools enabling inter-lexica integration and operability is the Lexus tool (Kemps-Snijders et al. 2006 ), based on the Lexical Markup Framework (ISO 24613 2008 ), that goes in the direction of managing the exchange of data among large-scale lexical resources. 1 However, the general impression is that not enough has been made towards the development of new methods and techniques for attaining a concrete interoperability among lexical resources, where by concrete we mean one allowing for smooth exchange of portions of information. Making the vision of shared and distributed lexical repositories a reality is a long-term scenario requiring the contribution of many different actors and initiatives, among which we only mention standardisation, the definition of distribution policies and international cooperation. In our work we adopted a bottom-up approach to exploring interop-erability of lexical resources by developing an application dedicated to the cross-lingual enrichment of monolingual lexicons. This is intended as a case-study and a test-bed for trying out needs and requirements posed by the challenge of semi-automatic integration and enrichment of practical, large-scale multilingual lexicons for use in computer applications. 2 An architecture for integrating lexical resources We designed a distributed architecture to enable a rapid prototyping of cooperative applications for integrating distributed lexical resources (Fig. 1 ).

This architecture is articulated in three layers. The lower layer consists of a grid of local wordnets realized as a virtual repository of XML databases residing at different locations and accessible through web services. Basic services are also necessary, such as an UDDI server for the registration of the local wordnets and other services devoted to the coherent management of the different versions of Princeton WordNet (i.e. WN1.5, WN1.6, etc.) to which the various databases are linked. The middle layer hosts diverse applications that exploit the wordnets grid. The so-called Multilingual WordNet Service (MWS, see Sect. 3 ) was built as a proof of concept of the possibility to mutually enrich wordnets in a distributed environment; other, more advanced NLP applications (in particular multilingual) can be developed by exploiting the availability of the WordNet grid. A higher layer, called  X  X  X ooperative layer X  X  or LeXFlow is intended as an overall environment where all the modules realized in the lower layers are integrated in a comprehensive workflow of human and software agents.

In this paper we concentrate on the description of the middle layer. A more detailed description of the cooperative layer can be found in (Soria et al. 2006a , b ; Tesconi et al. 2006 ). 3 Multilingual WordNet Service In this section we present an application that addresses the issue of lexicon augmentation or enrichment via cross-lingual traversal of two lexicons sharing a common interlingua. This tool, named  X  X  X ultilingual WordNet Service X  X  is respon-sible in particular for the semi-automatic cross-lingual fertilization of lexicons having a WordNet-like structure.

To put it very simply, the idea behind this tool is that a monolingual lexicon can be enriched by accessing the semantic information encoded in corresponding entries of other monolingual lexicons. As such, each entry (synset) of a lexicon A is linked to an interlingual node, which in turn can be linked to a synset in lexicon B. On the basis of this correspondence, a synset(A) can be enriched by importing the semantic relations that the corresponding synset(B) holds with other synsets(B), and vice-versa. Moreover, the enrichment of WN(A) will not only import the relations found in WN(B), but it will also propose target synsets in the language(A) on the basis of those found in language(B). 2 This tool is to be conceived as a module of a more general architecture for the integration of distributed lexical resources (Soria et al. 2006a , b ), where local wordnets are linked on a grid under the form of a virtual repository of XML databases residing at different locations and accessible through web services.
 The entire mechanism of the Multilingual WN Service relies on exploitation of the Interlingual Index or ILI (Peters et al. 1998 ), an unstructured version of WordNet used in the EuroWordNet project (Vossen 1998 ) to link wordnets of different languages. According to the EuroWordNet structure, each synset in a language-specific WordNet is linked to at least one record of the ILI by means of a set of equivalence relations, among which the most used and relevant for our purposes are the EQ_SYN and EQ_NEAR_SYN types. The former encodes an exact correspon-dence between two synsets, as in, for instance, between English synset dog_1 and Italian synset cane_1 . On the other hand, an EQ_NEAR_SYN equivalence relation expresses a quasi-synonymy relation, as in the case of English synset hair_1 and Italian synsets pelo_1 and capello_1 . So, while the EQ_SYN relation is a one-to-one mapping between the language-specific synset and the ILI, multiple EQ_NEAR_-SYN relations might be encoded to link a single language-specific synset to more than one ILI record.

Figure 2 shows possible directions that can be taken in cross-lingual traversal from synsets in WordNet A towards synsets in WordNet B. Solid lines represent EQ_SYN linking while dotted lines stand for EQ_NEAR_SYN relations. From left to right, the following cases are presented: 1. synset a EQ_SYN ILI and synset b EQ_SYN ILI. In this case we have direct 2. synset a EQ_SYN ILI and synset b (and c and d ) EQ_NEAR_SYN ILI: synset b 3. synset a EQ_NEAR_SYN ILI and synset b EQ_SYN ILI: the traversal 4. synset a EQ_NEAR_SYN ILI and synset b EQ_NEAR_SYN ILI: several paths
The cases above illustrate the possible relevant combinations of equivalence relations that can realize a mapping between synsets belonging to two languages. In all the four cases, a synset a is linked via the ILI record to a synset b , but the strength of the correspondence is sensibly different. A specific procedure has thus been devised in order to calculate different  X  X  X lausibility scores X  X  for each situation. The procedure relies on different scores assigned to the two equivalence relations (score  X  X 1 X  X  to EQ_NEAR_SYN relation and score  X  X 0 X  X  to the EQ_SYN). In this way we can distinguish the four cases above by assigning respectively a weight of  X  X 0 X  X ,  X  X 1 X  X ,  X  X 1 X  X  and  X  X 2 X  X .

The ILI is a quite powerful yet simple method to link concepts across the many lexicons belonging to the WordNet family. Unfortunately, various monolingual wordnets map onto different versions of the ILI, none of which can be considered a standard. This is a problem that is handled at web-service level, by incorporating the conversion tables provided by (Daude  X  et al. 2001 ). In this way, the use of different versions of WN does not have to be taken into consideration by the user who accesses the system but it is something that is resolved by the system itself. This is why the version of the ILI is a parameter of the query to web service.
 4 A case study: cross-fertilization between Italian and Chinese wordnets Once one or more correspondent synsets have been found in another lexicon on the basis of ILI linking, a synset can be enriched by importing the relations contained in the corresponding synsets belonging to the other WordNet relative. In the procedure adopted, the enrichment is performed on a synset-by-synset basis. In other words, a certain synset is selected from a WordNet resource, say WN(A). The cross-lingual module identifies the corresponding ILI synset, on the basis of the information encoded in the synset. It then sends a query to the WN(B) web service providing the ID of ILI synset together with the ILI version of the starting WN. 3 The WN(B) web service returns the synset(s) corresponding to the WN(A) synset, together with reliability scores. If WN(B) is based on a different ILI version, it can carry out the mapping between ILI versions (for instance by querying the ILI mapping web service). The cross-lingual module then analyzes the synset relations encoded in the WN(B) synset and for each of them creates a new synset relation for the WN(A) synset(3). 4 If the queried wordnets do not use the same set of synset relations, the module must take care of the mapping between different relation sets. Each new relation is obtained by substituting the target WN(B) synset with the corresponding synset WN(A), which again is found by querying back the WN(A) web service.

The procedure described above can be amenable to complete automatization only when the traversal from one lexicon to the other follows a path signaled by EQ_SYN relations from both sides. In all other cases, manual editorial intervention is required to validate the proposed additions (Fig. 3 ).

Our case-study involves an Italian WordNet, ItalWordNet or IWN (Roventini et al. 2003 ), and the Academia Sinica Bilingual Ontological WordNet or BOW, (Huang et al. 2004 ). The BOW integrates three resources: WordNet, English-Chinese Translation Equivalents Database (ECTED), and SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology). With the integration of these three key resources, Sinica BOW functions both as an English-Chinese bilingual WordNet and a bilingual lexical access to SUMO. Sinica Bow currently has two bilingual versions, corresponding to WordNet 1.6. and 1.7. Based on these bootstrapped versions, a Chinese WordNet (CWN, Huang et al. 2005 ) is under construction with handcrafted senses and lexical semantic relations. For the current experiment, we have used the version linking to WordNet 1.6. ItalWordNet was realized as an extension of the Italian component of EuroWordNet. It comprises a general component consisting of about 50,000 synsets and terminological wordnets linked to the generic WordNet by means of a specific set of relations. Each synset of ItalWordNet is linked to the Interlingual-Index (ILI). The two lexicons refer to different versions of the ILI (1.5 for IWN and 1.6 for BOW), thus making it necessary to provide a mapping between the two versions. On the other hand, no mapping is necessary for the set of synset relations used, since both of them adopt the same set.
Figure 4 shows a very simple example where our procedure discovers and proposes a new meronymy relation for the Italian synset  X  X  X assaggio,strada,via X  X . This synset is equivalent to the ILI  X  X  X oad,route X  X  that is ILI-connected with BOW synset  X  X  X ao_lu, dao, lu X  X  (Fig. 4 a) . The Chinese synset has a meronymy relation with the synset  X  X  X an X  X  (B). This last synset is equivalent to the ILI  X  X  X end, crook, turn X  X  that is ILI-connected with Italian WordNet synset  X  X  X urvatura, svolta, curva X  X  (C). Therefore the procedure will propose a new candidate meronymy relation between the two Italian WordNet synsets (D). 5 Conclusions and future work The approach described in this paper should be seen as a proof of concept of the issues involved in attaining lexicon interoperability, and it is by no means intended as a full scale experiment or implementation. To qualify as such, several other aspects should be thoroughly investigated, among which we mention the validity of the ILI as an interlingua, the quality of the semantic relations borrowed trans-lexically, together with a quantitative comparison of the number of the semantic relations imported with the current approach with comparison to other approaches to lexicon bootstrapping. Even from the narrow perspective of the small-scale exercise described above, however, there is a number of general issues concerning interoperability of lexicons that are easily apparent.

From a general point of view, we must note that the realization of the new vision of distributed and interoperable language resources is strictly tied to the issue of descriptive interoperability of lexicons. In the current work we could undermine this issue since we dealt with lexicons sharing a conventionalized and de-facto standardized architecture, i.e. the WordNet one. If, however, one thinks of integrating lexicons with different underlying linguistic models, then the availability of more substantial and comprehensive standards such as the recent ISO Lexical Markup Framework (ISO 24613 2008 ) becomes a crucial issue.

Our proposal aims at helping the setting up of a future scenario, hopefully not a too far one. To make distributed wordnets interoperable would allow to exploit in a cross-lingual framework the wealth of monolingual lexical information built in the last decade. Several applications can be envisaged for the processing of lexical resources. First of all, it can be used to enrich existing resources: information is never complete in any given WordNet and, by making two wordnets interoperable, we can bootstrap semantic relations and other information from other wordnets. Second, it can be applied to the creation of new resources: multilingual lexicons can be bootstrapped by linking different language wordnets through ILI. Third, it can also be exploited for validation of existing resources: semantic relation information and other synset assignments can be validated when it is reinforced by data from a different WordNet.

In particular, our work can be proposed as a prototype of a web application that would support the Global WordNet Grid initiative ( http://www.globalwordnet.org/ gwa/gwa_grid.htm ). Any multilingual process, such as cross-lingual information retrieval, must involve both resources and tools in a specific language and language pairs. For instance, a multilingual query given in Italian but intended for querying English, Chinese, French, German, and Russian texts, can be sent to five different nodes on the Grid for query expansion, as well as performing the query itself. In this way, language specific query techniques can be applied in parallel to achieve best results that can be integrated in the future. As multilingualism clearly becomes one of the major challenges of the future of web-based knowledge engineering, WordNet emerges as one leading candidate for a shared platform for representing a lexical knowledge model for different languages of the world. This is true even if it has to be recognized that the WordNet model is lacking in some important semantic information (like, for instance, a way to represent the semantic predicate). However, such knowledge and resources are distributed. In order to create a shared multi-lingual knowledge base for cross-lingual processing based on these distributed resources, an initiative to create a grid-like structure has been recently proposed and promoted by the Global WordNet Association, but until now has remained a wishful thinking. The success of this initiative will depend on whether there will be tools to access and manipulate the rich internal semantic structure of distributed multi-lingual wordnets. We believe that our work offers such a tool to provide inter-operable web-services to access distributed multilingual wordnets on the grid. References
