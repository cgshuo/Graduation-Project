The analysis and the corresponding knowledge discovery of microblog data have the increased volume of microblogging data generated by more and more users. For example, many companies adopt microblogging social media services as ideal Among the various perspectives of knowledge discover in microblog related applica-tions, the analysis of the so-called community structure of online social networks has that it is likely to stimulate new purchases effectively by targeting a product on poten-purchased the product. 
Naturally, in a specific physical domain or logical range, the users with communi-microblogs could help us understand and exploit these networks more effectively, centered on which various studies on community discovery or detection were con-ducted [4, 5]. For this purpose, many scientists cluster users by the  X  X ollow X  relation-followed by) other similar ones if their relationships of message communication could users in small communities, large communities can be generated by merging the small ones that share a certain number of user s according to a pre-defined threshold. How-community mistakenly, since the close or remote relationships not only depend on the number of associations, but also on the strength of these associations. 
Consequently, some sociologists [7, 8] proposed the method for measuring the re-lationship strength based on communication reciprocity and interaction frequency. By 10], but just two levels of strength, namely weak and strong, were considered. There-fore, from the community discovery point of view, it is desired to develop a strength metric to describe the relationships both qualitatively and quantitatively. 
As stated above, the relationships among microblog users can be represented by a weighted network composed of vertices and weighted edges, on which the relation-ship strengths can be looked upon as the weight. The property of community structure strength between them. Starting from this observation, many clustering algorithms in social network analysis, such as GN, CNM, have been applied for community discov-ery on weighted networks [11, 12]. But only the coarse structure of the communities concept of modularity density criterion and proved the k-means algorithm which can optimize the criterion to obtain finer results. Actually, in the clustering algorithms like k-means, the number of clusters is to be specified in advance, which cannot be made microblog users cannot be known clearly. hierarchical community discovery by statistical analysis on the behavioral interactions this paper can be summarized as follows:  X 
To measure the actual relationships between users by a finer manner, we presented the graph-based method for modeling the microblog users. Then, we proposed a quantitatively, as the generalization of current metric including just weak and strong states.  X

In Section 4, we show experimental results and performance analysis. In Section 5, we conclude and discuss future work. metric to quantify the relationship strength between a given pair of users.
Microblog has two special tweet types fo r communication among users, called rep-lies and retweets. In the network of microblog users, the edges correspond to the di-rected interactions of replies or retweets among users. 
A  X  X eply X  is a tweet sent in response to an earlier tweet and it includes the earlier tweet ID. This type of tweet typically includes  X  X account_name X  followed by the new message. All of the users following either the replying user or the replied-to user can read this tweet. When a tweet is  X  X etweeted X  (abbreviated as RT) by a user, it is broadcast to the user X  X  followers. For an official RT with twitter X  X  retweet command, the tweet is simply reposted without changing the original message. An unofficial RT is created by retweet users using the  X  X T @account_name_original message X  nota-tion, possibly followed by additional text. 
It is well known that the more reciprocal and frequent of interaction of a pair, the closer their relation will be. Therefore, we can simply define the relationship strength as follows: weights in the directed micoblog behavioral network. The most intuitionistic metric to quantify the F ij can be computed as follows: However, Eq. (2) is not suitable for measuring the relationship strength. For example, the values of Eq. (2) for different pairs (1, 10) and (1, 1000) are equal. Actually in the microblog applications, the information on some nodes is always transmitted enorm-ously by others nodes, but these nodes themselves transmit little from other nodes. This appears frequently between the nodes corresponding to stars and their fans. Although the sum of interactions is very high, stars and their fans are generally not very close higher than that between 1 and 1000. should tend to flat with the increase of total interactions. So, we can compute the fre-quency strength as * ij ij ji Fre w w = , and Eq. (2) can be improved as follows: 
By using Eq. (3), we can transform the dir ected weighted network to an undirected undirected one shown in Fig. 2. In Section 3, we will present our method for commu-nity detection based on the undirected network. A widely used quantitative measure for evaluating the partition of a network is called modularity (known as Q ), which was introduced in [14]. Recently, Fortunato et al. [15] links in the network, and stated that Q -based method only can detect the coarse struc-ture of the communities. To improve the situation, Li et al. [13] introduced modularity density ( D ) which takes both edge and node into account, and was proved to be able First, we introduce some related concepts. Definition 1. [13] The density of subgraphs is defined as: vertexes in V i , fall in the subgraph G i ), and communities, computed by Eq. (4), should be as large as possible. Li [13] also gave the definition of modularity density. Definition 2. [13] Modularity density of G is defined as This measure provides a way to determine whether a certain microscopic description of the graph is accurate in terms of communities. The larger the value of D , the more upon as the problem of finding a partition of a network such that its modularity densi-ty D is maximized. 
Naturally, this can be done by optimizing the quantitative measure or adopting the quantitative measure into a certain clustering algorithm. The FN algorithm [14] used previous configuration. However, this optimized idea does not suit for the modularity density in Definition 2. The problem is that the subgraph containing a single node has suppose that D  X  X  value of all single node subgraphs is 0, and define the subgraph prox-imity for merging nodes. Our basic idea is as follows: two subgraphs will be merged make  X  D&gt; 0, specified in Definition 3. Definition 3. The subgraph proximity between V i and V j is defined as no connection between G i and G j , then pro ij equals 0, and if G i and G j are only con-nected by each other, then pro ij equals 1.

In some network, the idea of joining the pair of subgraphs with the maximal prox-merged than small ones. In extreme cases, the whole network may be clustered as just one community. The reason is that large subgraphs have more nodes, even if they are also more than those in small ones. For example, w.r.t. the two communities in Fig. 2, the together as one community in each time when D is increased. To avoid this situation, Fig. 4 illustrates the random choose, from which the correct result can be obtained. Algorithm HCD: CommuDis ( G ) Input: the relationship network G Local variables: C : adjacent matrix of a subgraph of G . The value of each cell C ij is the number of edges connecting vertices in subgraph i to those in subgraph j . V : node set of a subgraph. V i records the nodes in sub-graph i. Initialize each node as a subgraph: V [ i ]  X  node i.
 N : the number of nodes in G F : termination of array. The value of F i is the index of V i which is not a community. Initialization, all the in-dexes of the subgraphs in V are added into F . When F is empty, the algorithm could be stopped. for i  X  0 to N  X  1 do while true do if F . length = 0 then return V end if for i  X  0 to V . length  X  1 do if i  X  m and C im  X 0 then end if continue // select m again else delete the k th element from F delete the k th column and row from C end if end while end for return V
Algorithm HCD starts from a state in which each vertex is the sole member of one of n subgraphs. At each step for the randomly chosen subgraph m , joining subgraph i with the greatest pro mi , which makes modularity density D increased. The value of D subgraph in F will take O (1) time. Since the joining of a pair of communities between pro mi and  X  D only depends on k (the mean of the node degree of the whole network) each step of the algorithm takes O ( k+n ) time in the worst case. There is a maximum of n  X 1 join operations necessary to construct the complete dendrogram and hence the To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we made experiments on reso-granularity of discovered communities, which indicates the range of communities that can be identified. The precision was used to indicate the number of users included in the communities that are discovered correctly. The efficiency was tested by compar-experiments were run on a PC with 3.0 GHz processor, 2.0 GB memory, running Windows XP Professional. The codes were written in JAVA. 4.1 Resolution Ratio Due to the small network can be clearer to illustrate, we tested the resolution ratio of our result on well-studied small networks. The Zachary X  X  karate club network [16] is club which was observed over a period of two years. Due to a disagreement between ones. Fig. 5 shows the Karate club network, where the shapes of the vertices represent 2 groups: the instructor and administrator factions respectively. topology of the network. However, only two coarse structures were found by the fam-ous algorithm based on Q proposed by Clauset, Newman and Moore (CNM) [17]. The Community 1# and 2# were split into 4 subgraphs by the density-based k-means algo-proposed in this paper. This means that the resolution ratio of the result of Algorithm signed properly, since it should be assigned to Community 1# or Community 2# di-rectly from the topology of the network. By the density-based k-means algorithm, 4 knowledge in advance. 4.2 Precision mark computer-generated networks (denoted FLR) proposed by Lancichinetti et al. 19]. Thus, it is generally accepted as a proxy of a real network with community struc-ture and appropriate to evaluate the performance of the community detection algo-adjust the average ratio  X  to alter the community structure from apparent to fuzzy. 
To evaluate the precision of the community identification, we used the normalized shows the variation of the normal mutual information obtained by our method on the 1.5 and muw = 0.1. The 2 curves in Fig. 6 correspond to the 2 different scales of net-works which have 1000 nodes and 10000 nodes respectively. With the increase of  X  , the community structure in the networks becomes more fuzzy and harder to identify. 
Comparing the results obtained by Algorithm HCD and CNM, we note that Algo-slower than that of CNM. Moreover, as the number of nodes increasing, from 1000 to 10000, the curves of CNM go down more quickly with respect to larger networks. On size of network gets larger. 4.3 Efficiency scales by comparing the execution time of Algorithm HCD proposed in this paper and those of FN and CNM as the improvement of FN. The comparisons were made with CNM but smaller than that of FN when the network gets larger and larger. 
To sum up, we can conclude from the above experimental results that our algo-rithm for community detection can achieve more precise results than CNM, but is less efficient than CNM although more efficient than FN. This makes us improve our from FN to CNM, which is our future work. In this paper, we used the weighted graph to model microblog users and their relation-efficient for community detection in the microblog networks. The methods proposed in this paper also leave open some other research issues. For example, different types of behavioral interactions may have different effects on relationships, but our method does not make a distinction between them. According to the fact that different interactions correspond to different weights, it may be possible works are frequent large, so the efficiency and scalability of our method is desired to be improved. In addition, the interaction in microblog occurs over time gradually, the These issues are exactly our future work. Acknowledgement.
