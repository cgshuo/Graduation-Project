 Online social networks o  X  ering various services have become ubiquitous in our daily life. Meanwhile, users nowadays are usually involved in multiple online social networks simulta-neously to enjoy specific services provided by di  X  erent net-works. Formally, social networks that share some common users are named as partially aligned networks. In this paper, we want to predict the formation of social links in multiple partially aligned social networks at the same time, which is formally defined as the multi-network link (formation) pre-diction problem. In multiple partially aligned social net-works, users can be extensively correlated with each other by various connections. To categorize these diverse connec-tions among users, 7  X  X ntra-network social meta paths X  and 4 categories of  X  X nter-network social meta paths X  are pro-posed in this paper. These  X  X ocial meta paths X  can cover a wide variety of connection information in the network, some of which can be helpful for solving the multi-network link prediction problem but some can be not. To utilize useful connection information, a subset of the most informative X  X o-cial meta paths X  are picked, the process of which is formally defined as  X  X ocial meta path selection X  in this paper. An e  X  ective general link formation prediction framework, Mli (M ulti-network L ink I dentifier), is proposed in this paper to solve the multi-network link (formation) prediction prob-lem. Built with heterogenous topological features extracted based on the selected X  X ocial meta paths X  X n the multiple par-tially aligned social networks, Mli can help refine and dis-ambiguate the prediction results reciprocally in all aligned networks. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world partially aligned heterogeneous networks, Foursquare and Twitter, demonstrate that Mli can solve the multi-network link prediction problem very well.

Nowadays, online social networks with specific character-istics have become an essential part in our daily life. Users in online social networks can usually enjoy a wide variety of social services, e.g., establish social connections with friends, write online posts, check in at locations. Meanwhile, social networks which provide these various services can usually contain heterogeneous information, which include multiple kinds of information entities, e.g., users, posts and locations, and complex links among these entities, e.g., social links among users [25, 26] and location checkin links between users and locations [26].

Via these diverse links in online social networks, users can be connected with each other closely. Consider, for example, given two users, Alice and Bob , who both have checked in at the X  Lincoln Memorial  X  X n Foursquare 1 , the location checkin links X  Alice Lincoln Memorial Bob  X  X an form a path from Alice to Bob in the network. Formally, the sequences of links starting and ending with users in online social networks are defined as the social paths . The length of social paths is defined as the number of links that constitute them. For instance, path  X  Alice Lincoln Memorial Bob  X  X sasocial path of length 2 connecting Alice and Bob in Foursquare.
In all possible connections among users, social links, which are one kind of social paths of length 1 as well, among users have received lots of attention in recent years [21, 22, 23]. The problem of predicting social links to be formed in the near future based on a snapshot of online social networks is formally defined as the social link (formation) prediction problem. Many concrete social services in social networks can be cast as social link prediction problems, e.g., friend recommendation. Meanwhile, as pointed out in [25], users X   X  X oyalty X  to a social network is positively correlated to the number of friends they have in the network. As a result, social link formation prediction problem, which can help in-troduce more social connections for users, can be very im-portant for online social networks.

Traditional link prediction problems which aim at predict-ing one single kind of links in one network [16, 20, 24, 3] have been studied for many years. Dozens of di  X  erent link pre-diction methods have been proposed so far [1, 14, 19, 16, 20, 24, 3]. Conventional link prediction methods usually assume https://foursquare.com that there exists su cient information within the network to compute features (e.g., common neighborhoods [9]) for each pair of nodes. However, as proposed in [25, 26], such as-sumption can be violated seriously when dealing with social networks containing little information because of the  X  X ew network X  problems.

The new network problem can be encountered when online social networks branch into new geographic areas or social groups [26] and information within the new networks can be too sparse to build e  X  ective link prediction models. Mean-while, Zhang et al. [10, 25, 26] notice that users nowadays can participate in multiple online social networks simulta-neously. Users who are involved in a new network can have been using other well-developed networks for a long time, in which they can have plenty of heterogeneous information. To address the new network problem, Zhang et al. [25, 26] propose to transfer information from the well-developed net-works to overcome the shortage of information problem in the new network. Formally, networks that share some com-mon users are defined as the  X  partially aligned networks  X  and the common users shared across these  X  partially aligned networks  X  are named as the  X  anchor users  X  [10, 25, 26]. In this paper, we define the unshared users as the  X  non-anchor users  X  between the aligned networks .

Social networks aligned by the  X  X nchor users X  can share common information. Meanwhile, as proposed in [15, 23], di  X  erent online social networks constructed to provide dif-ferent services usually have distinct characteristics. More-over, information in various social networks may be of dif-ferent distributions [15, 23], which is named as the  X  network di  X  erence problem  X  in this paper. The  X  network di  X  erence problem  X  will be a obstacle in link prediction across multi-ple partially aligned networks , as it is likely that information transferred from other aligned networks could deteriorate the prediction performance in a given network.

In this paper, we want to predict the formation of social links in multiple partially aligned networks simultaneously, which is formally defined as the multi-network link prediction problem in this paper. As introduced at the beginning of this section, the multi-network link prediction problem can have very extensive applications in real-world social networks. As a result, the multi-network link prediction problem studied in this paper is very important for multiple partially aligned social networks .

The multi-network link prediction problem studied in this paper is a novel problem and totally di  X  erent from other existing link prediction problems. Moreover, link predic-tion methods proposed in [25, 26] cannot be applied to solve the multi-network link prediction problem directly because these existing methods: (1) are proposed to transfer use-ful information for anchor users only; (2) fail to consider the network di  X  erence problem ; (3) can only predict links in each network independently. A more detailed comparison of the multi-network link prediction problem with these cor-related problems, e.g., social link prediction for new users [25], transfer heterogeneous links across networks [26], an-chor link prediction [10] and multi-transfer with multiple views and sources [18], is available in Table 1.

Despite of its importance and novelty, the multi-network link prediction problem studied in this paper is also very challenging to solve due to the following reasons:
To solve all these above challenges in the multi-network link prediction problem, a novel link prediction framework, Mli , is proposed in this paper. Inspired by Sun X  X  [17] work on meta path as a means to capture similarity of nodes, which are not directly connected in heterogeneous infor-mation networks, Mli explores the meta path concept to generate useful features. Mli can generate not only intra-network features via  X  X ntra-network meta paths X , but also inter-network features via X  X nter-network meta paths X  X hrough the anchor links . By judiciously selecting the  X  X nter-network meta paths X , Mli can take advantage of the commonality among the multiple partially aligned networks , while contain the potential negative transfers from network di  X  erences. These derived features can greatly improve the e  X  ectiveness of Mli in predicting links for each network. Furthermore, Mli is a general link formation prediction framework that solves the multi-network link prediction problem and the link prediction tasks in di  X  erent networks can help each other mutually.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formulate the problem. Detailed description of the meth-ods is available in Section 3. We show the experiment results in Section 4. Related works are given in Section 5. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 6.
In this section, we will give the formal definitions of many important concepts used in this paper and the formulation of the multi-network link prediction problem. Definition 1 (Heterogeneous Social Network): A social net-work is heterogeneous if it contains multiple kinds of nodes and links. Heterogeneous social networks can be represented as G =( V, E ), where V = sets and E =
Networks used in this paper are Twitter and Foursquare, which are both heterogeneous social networks. Users in both Twitter and Foursquare can make friends with other users, write posts online, which can contain text content, timestamps and attach location check-ins. Both Twitter and Foursquare can be formulated as G =( V, E ), where V = U [ P [ L [ T [ W , and U , P , L , T and W are the sets of user, post, location, timestamp and word nodes in the net-work respectively, while E = E u,u [ E u,p [ E p,l [ E p,t are the sets of heterogeneous links in G , which include the social links among users, write link between users and posts, links between posts and locations, timestamps and words. Definition 2 (Aligned Heterogeneous Social Networks): If two di  X  erent social networks share some common users, then these two networks are called aligned networks . Multiple aligned heterogeneous social networks can be formulated as G =(( G 1 ,G 2 ,  X  X  X  ,G n ) , ( A 1 , 2 ,A 1 , 3 ,  X  X  X  ,A A ( n 1) ,n )), where G i ,i 2 { 1 , 2 ,  X  X  X  ,n } is a heterogeneous undirected anchor links between G i and G j .
 Definition 3 (Anchor Links): Let U i and U j be the user sets of G i and G j respectively. Link ( u i ,v j ) is a undirected anchor link between G i and G j i  X  ( u i 2 U i ) ^ ( v j ( u i and v j are the accounts of the same user in G i and G j respectively).
 Definition 4 (Anchor Users): User u i 2 U i is an anchor user in G i between G i and G j i  X  9 v j 2 U j , ( u i ,v The set of anchor users in G i between G i and G j can be represented as U i A i,j = { u i | u i 2 U i , 9 v j 2 U j A Definition 5 (Non-Anchor Users): User u i 2 U i is an non-anchor user between G i and G j i  X  u i / 2 U i A i,j . The set of non-anchor users in G i between G i and G j can be repre-Definition 6 (Full Alignment): Networks G i and G j are fully aligned if users in both G i and G j are all anchor users. In other words, G i and G j are fully aligned i  X  ( U i A i,j U Definition 7 (Partial Alignment): Networks G i and G j are partially aligned if there exist users in G i or G j who are non-anchor users . In other words, G i and G j are partially aligned i  X  (( U i A i,j 6 = ; ) _ ( U j A i,j 6 = ; )) ^ ( A
Considering that fully aligned networks can hardly exist in the real world, di  X  erent from the strict full alignment assumption of networks proposed in [10, 25], networks used in this paper are partially aligned instead. In addition, there exists no restriction about the constraint on anchor links , which means that the anchor links can be either one-to-one [10] or many-to-many .
Let G i ,i 2 { 1 , 2 ,  X  X  X  ,n } be a heterogeneous online social network in the multiple aligned networks . The user set and existing social link set of G i can be represented as U i E u,u respectively. In network G i , all the existing links are the formed links and, as a result, the formed links of G i can be represented as P i , where P i = E i u,u . Furthermore, a large set of unconnected user pairs are referred to as the unconnected links, U i , and can be extracted from network G : U i = U i  X  U i P i . However, no information about links that will never be formed can be obtained from the network. In this paper, with P i and U i , we formulate the link formation prediction as a PU link prediction problem.
Similarly, let {P 1 ,  X  X  X  , P n } , {U 1 ,  X  X  X  , U n } and {L be the sets of formed links, unconnected links, and links to be predicted of G 1 ,G 2 ,  X  X  X  ,G n respectively. With the formed and unconnected links of G 1 ,G 2 ,  X  X  X  ,G n ,wecan solve the multi-network link prediction problem as a multi-PU link prediction problem.
In this section, we will introduce Mli to solve the multi-network link prediction problem. This section includes 3 parts: (1) social meta path based feature extraction and se-lection; (2) PU link prediction; (3) multi-network link pre-diction framework.
Before talking about the link prediction methods, we will introduce the features extracted from the partially aligned networks in this subsection at first.
Users in heterogeneous online social network can be ex-tensively connected to each other via di  X  erent paths. In this part, we will categorize the diverse paths connecting users in one single network with the intra-network social meta paths concept.
For a given heterogeneous online social network, e.g., G ,to describe its structure more clearly, we define its schema to be S
G =( T,R ), where T , R are the sets of node types and link types in G . For example, if G =( V, E ), where V = U [ P [ L contains user, post and location nodes, E = E u,u [ E u,p contains the social links, write links and location links, then S G =( T,R ), T = { User, Post, Location } and R = { Social Link, Write Link, Location Link } . A complete schema of networks studied in this paper is shown in Figure 1. In network G , nodes can be connected with each other via ex-tensive paths consisting of various links. To categorize all possible paths in heterogeneous networks G , we define the concept of intra-network meta path based on schema S G as follows: Definition 8 (Intra-Network Meta Path): Based on the given the network schema, S G =( T,R ), = T 1 R 1 ! T 2 R  X  X  X  R k 1 ! T k is defined to be a meta path in network G , 1 } .

Meanwhile, depending on types of nodes and links that constitute it, can be divided into two di  X  erent categories. Definition 9 (Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Intra-Network Meta Path): For a given meta path = T 1 R 1 ! T 2 R 2 !  X  X  X  R k 1 ! T k defined based on S G ,if( T 1 ,  X  X  X  ,T k are all the same ) ^ ( R 1 ,  X  X  X  ,R k 1 are all the same), then is a ho-mogeneous meta path ; otherwise P is a heterogeneous meta path .

In this paper, we are mainly concerned about meta paths connecting user nodes, which can be defined as the intra-network social meta path .
 Definition 10 (Intra-Network Social Meta Path): For a fined based on S G ,if T 1 and T k are both the  X  X ser X  node type, then P is defined as a social meta path . Depending on whether T 1 ,  X  X  X  ,T k and R 1 ,  X  X  X  ,R k 1 are the same or not, P can be divided into two categories: homogeneous intra-network social meta path and heterogeneous intra-network social meta path .

Based on the schema of networks studied in this paper, shown in Figure 1, we can define many di  X  erent kinds of homogeneous and heterogeneous intra-network social meta paths for network G , whose physical meanings and notations are listed as follows: Homogeneous Intra-Network Social Meta Path Heterogeneous Intra-Network Social Meta Path
Meta paths introduced in the previous part can actually cover a large number of path instances connecting users in the network. Formally, we denote that node n (or link l ) is an instance of node type T (or link type R ) in the net-work as n 2 T (or l 2 R ). Identity function I ( a, A )= ( 1 , if a 2 A 0 ,otherwise, stance of node/link type A in the network. To consider the e  X  ect of the unconnected links when extracting features for social links in the network, we formally define the Intra-Network Social Meta Path based Features to be: Definition 11 (Intra-Network Social Meta Path based Fea-tures): For a given link ( u, v ), the feature extracted for it based on meta path = T 1 R 1 ! T 2 R 2 !  X  X  X  R k 1 ! T k from the network is defined to be the expected number of formed path instances between u and v in the network: x ( u, v )= I ( u, T 1 ) I ( v, T k ) where p ( n i ,n i +1 )=1 . 0if( n i ,n i +1 ) 2 E u,u and other-wise, p ( n i ,n i +1 ) denotes the formation probability of link ( n i ,n i +1 ) to be introduced in Subsection 3.2.

Features extracted based on = { 1 ,  X  X  X  , 6 } are named as the intra-network social meta path based social features. ( 0 will be used in Subsection 3.1.4 only.)
When a network is very new, features extracted based on intra-network social meta paths can be very sparse, as there exist few connections in the network. Consider, for example, in Figure 2, we want to predict whether social link ( A 1 ,B 1 ) in network G 1 will be formed or not. Merely based on the intra-network social meta paths , the feature vector of extracted for link ( A 1 ,B 1 )willbe 0 . However, we find that A 1 and B 1 can be correlated actually with various inter-network paths, e.g., B 1 ! B 2 ! A 2 ! A 1 , B 1 ! B 2 ! F 2 ! A 2 ! A 1 and B 1 ! B 2 ! E 2 ! A 2 ! A 1 .

By following this idea, we propose to transfer useful in-formation from aligned networks with the following anchor meta path and the inter-network social meta paths to be introduced in Subsection 3.1.4.
 Definition 12 (Anchor Meta Path): Let U i , U j be the user nodes of G i and G j respectively and A i,j be the anchor links between G i and G j . Meta path  X  = T 1 R 1 ! T 2 anchor meta path between network G i and G j i  X  T 1 = U i and T 2 = U j and R 1 = A i,j . The notation of anchor meta
Figure 2: Meta Path across Aligned Networks. path from G i to G j is  X  ( U i ,U j ) and the length of  X  ( U is 1.
Based on the definition of anchor meta path , we can de-scribe the inter-network paths from B 1 to A 1 in Figure 2 with the following inter-network meta path .
 Definition 13 (Inter-Network Meta Path): Meta path = T across G i and G j i  X  9 m 2 { 1 , 2 ,  X  X  X  ,k 1 } , T m R  X  ( U i ,U j ).

In this paper, we are concerned about inter-network meta path starting and ending with users, which are named as the inter-network social meta path . The 4 specific inter-network social meta paths used in this paper include: Category 1 :  X  ( U i ,U j ) ( ( U j ,U j ) [ 0 ( U j ,U j whose notation is 1 ( U i ,U i ); Category 2. :( ( U i ,U i ) [ 0 ( U i ,U i ))  X  ( U i ,U j ( U j ,U j ))  X  ( U j ,U i ), whose notation is 2 ( U i ,U Category 3. :  X  ( U i ,U j ) ( ( U j ,U j ) [ 0 ( U j ,U j ( ( U i ,U i ) [ 0 ( U i ,U i )), whose notation is 3 ( U Category 4. :( ( U i ,U i ) [ 0 ( U i ,U i ))  X  ( U i ,U j ( U j ,U j ))  X  ( U j ,U i ) ( ( U i ,U i ) [ 0 ( U i ,U i tation is 4 ( U i ,U i ); where ( U i ,U i ) [ 0 ( U i ,U i )= { 0 ( U i ,U i ) ,  X  X  X  , denote the 7 intra-network social meta paths of network G introduced in Subsection 3.1.1.

Let = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } . is a comprehensive inter-network social meta path set and features extracted based on can transfer information for both anchor users and non-anchor users from other aligned networks. For example, in Figure 2, by following path  X  B 1 ! B 2 ! A 2 ! A 1  X , we can go from anchor user B 1 to anchor user A 1 and such path is an instance of 1 ( U 1 ,U 1 ); by following path C A 1 ! A 2 ! D 2 ! D 1 , we can go from non-anchor user C 1 to anchor user D 1 , which is an instance of 2 ( U 1 ,U 1 addition, by following path C 1 ! A 1 ! A 2 ! B 2 ! B 1 ! E , we can go from non-anchor user C 1 to non-anchor user E , which is an instance of 4 ( U 1 ,U 1 ).
As introduced in Section 1, information transferred from aligned networks is helpful for improving link prediction per-formance in a given network but can be misleading as well, which is called the network di  X  erence problem .Tosolve the network di  X  erence problem , we propose to rank and se-lect top K features from the feature vector extracted based on the intra-network and inter-network social meta paths , [ x
T , x T ] T , from the multiple partially aligned heterogeneous networks .

Let variable X i 2 [ x T , x T ] T be a feature extracted based on a meta path in { , } and variable Y be the label . P ( Y = y ) denotes the prior probability that links in the training set having label y and P ( X i = x ) represents the frequency that feature X i has value x . Information theory related measure mutual information (mi) is used as the ranking criteria: mi ( X i )=
Let [  X x T ,  X x T ] T be the features of the top K mi score se-lected from [ x T , x T ] T . In the next subsection, we will use the selected feature vector [  X x T ,  X x T ] T to build a novel PU link prediction model. In this subsection, we will propose a method to solve the PU link prediction problem in one single network.
 As introduced in Section 2, from a given network, e.g., G , we can get two disjoint sets of links: connected (i.e., formed) links P and unconnected links U . To di  X  erentiate these links, we define a new concept  X  connection state  X , z ,in this paper to show whether a link is connected (i.e., formed) or unconnected in network G . For a given link l ,if l is connected in the network, then z ( l ) = +1; otherwise, z ( l )= 1. As a result, we can have the  X  connection states  X  of links in P and U to be: z ( P )=+ 1 and z ( U )= 1 .

Besides the  X  connection state  X , links in the network can also have their own  X  labels  X , y , which can represent whether a link is to be formed or will never be formed in the network. For a given link l ,if l has been formed or to be formed, then y ( l ) = +1; otherwise, y ( l )= 1. Similarly, we can have the  X  labels  X  of links in P and U to be: y ( P )=+ 1 but y ( U )can be either +1 or 1, as U can contain both links to be formed and links that will never be formed.

By using P and U as the positive and negative training sets, we can build a link c onnection prediction model M c which can be applied to predict whether a link exists in the original network, i.e., the connection state of a link. Let l be a link to be predicted, by applying M c to classify l ,we can get the connection probability of l to be: Definition 14 : (Connection Probability): The probabil-ity that link l  X  X  connection states is predicted to be con-nected (i.e., z ( l ) = +1) is formally defined as the connec-[  X x ( l ) T ,  X x ( l ) T ] T .
Meanwhile, if we can obtain a set of links that  X  X ill never be formed X , i.e.,  X -1 X  X inks, from the network, which together with P ( X +1 X  links) can be used to build a link f ormation prediction model , M f , which can be used to get the forma-tion probability of l to be: Definition 15 : (Formation Probability): The probability that link l  X  X  label is predicted to be formed or will be formed (i.e., y ( l ) = +1) is formally defined as the formation proba-bility of link l : p ( y ( l )=+1 | x ( l )).

However, from the network, we have no information about  X  X inks that will never be formed X (i.e., X -1 X  X inks). As a result, the formation probabilities of potential links that we aim to obtain as proposed in Section 2 can be very challenging to calculate. Meanwhile, the correlation between link l  X  X  connection probability and formation probability has been proved in existing works [5] to be:
In other words, for links whose connection probabilities are low, their formation probabilities will be relatively low as well. This rule can be utilized to extract links which can be more likely to be the reliable  X -1 X  links from the network. We propose to apply the the link connection prediction model M c built with P and U to classify links in U to extract the reliable negative link set .
 Definition 16 : (Reliable Negative Link Set): The reliable negative links in the unconnected link set U are those whose connection probabilities predicted by the link connection pre-diction model , M c , are lower than threshold  X  2 [0 , 1]:
Some Heuristic methods have been proposed to set the optimal threshold  X  , e.g., the spy technique proposed in [13]. As shown in Figure 3, we randomly selected a subset of links in P as the spy, SP , whose proportion is controlled by s %. s % = 15% is used as the default sample rate in this paper. Sets ( P SP ) and ( U [ SP ) are used as positive and negative training sets to the s py prediction model, M s . By applying M s to classify links in ( U [ SP ), we can get their connection probabilities to be: and parameter  X  is set as the minimal connection probability of spy links in SP :
With the extracted reliable negative link set RN ,wecan solve the PU link prediction problem with classification based link prediction methods , where P and RN are used as the positive and negative training sets respectively. Meanwhile, when applying the built model to predict links in L i , the op-timal labels,  X  Y i ,of L i , should be those which can maximize the following formation probabilities : where y ( L i )= Y i represents that links in L i have labels Y
Figure 4: Multi-PU Link Prediction Framework.
Method Mli proposed in this paper is a general link pre-diction framework and can be applied to predict social links in n partially aligned networks simultaneously. When it comes to n partially aligned network formulated in Section 2, the optimal labels of potential links {L 1 , L 2 ,  X  X  X  , L works G 1 ,G 2 ,  X  X  X  ,G n will be:  X  Y ,  X  Y 2 ,  X  X  X  ,  X  Y n = arg max
The above target function is very complex to solve and, in this paper, we propose to obtain the solution by up-dating one variable, e.g., Y 1 , and fix other variables, e.g., Y ,  X  X  X  , Y n , alternatively with the following equation [26]: 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : (  X 
Y 1 ) (  X  ) = arg max Y 1 p ( y ( L 1 )= Y 1 | G 1 ,G 2 ,  X  X  X  ,G (  X 
Y 2 ) (  X  ) = arg max Y 2 p ( y ( L 2 )= Y 2 | G 1 ,G 2 ,  X  X  X  ,G (  X 
Y n ) (  X  ) = arg max Y n p ( y ( L n )= Y n | G 1 ,G 2 ,  X  X  X  ,G The structure of framework Mli is shown in Figure 4. When predicting social links in network G i , we can extract features based on the intra-network social meta path , x , extracted from G i and those extracted based on the inter-network social meta path , x , across G 1 , G 2 ,  X  X  X  , G G i +1 ,  X  X  X  , G n for links in P i , U i and L i . Feature vectors x ( P ), x ( U ) and x ( P ), x ( U ) as well as the labels, y ( P ), y ( U ), of links in P and U are passed to the PU link prediction model M i and the meta path selection model MS i . The for-mation probabilities of links in L i predicted by model M will be used to update the network by replace the weights of L i with the newly predicted formation probabilities. The initial weights of these potential links in L i are set as 0 (i.e., the formation probability of links mentioned in Definition 11). After finishing these steps on G i , we will move to con-duct similar operations on G i +1 . We iteratively predict links in G 1 to G n alternatively in a sequence until the results in all of these networks converge. Table 2: Properties of the Heterogeneous Networks Figure 5: E  X  ects of anchor link ratio  X  A on predic-tion results in di  X  erent networks evaluated by dif-ferent metrics.
To demonstrate the e  X  ectiveness of Mli in dealing with real-world multiple partially aligned heterogeneous networks , we will conduct extensive experiments in this section. This section includes 3 parts: (1) dataset description; (2) experi-ment setting; (3) experiment results.
The datasets used in this paper are Foursquare and Twit-ter, both of which are famous heterogeneous online social networks. These two networks were crawled during Novem-ber of 2012 [10, 25, 26]. The structures of both Foursquare and Twitter have been introduced in Section 2. Statistical information about these two datasets is available in Table 2: Figure 6: Convergence analysis in di  X  erent networks under the evaluation of di  X  erent metrics.
To show the advantages of Mli , we compare Mli with many other baseline methods, which include:
The social links in both Foursquare and Twitter are used as the ground truth to evaluate the prediction results. SVM [2] with linear kernel and optimal parameters is used as the base classifier of all comparison methods. Accuracy , AUC and F1 score are used as the evaluation metrics in this paper.
All the existing links in Foursquare are used as the pos-itive link set and a proportion of unconnected links among users except the positive links are sampled as the negative link set, which is of the same size as the positive link set. Both the positive and negative link sets are divided into 5 folds: 4 folds as the training set and 1 fold as the test set. To represent di  X  erent degrees of newness (available informa-tion users have in the networks), a fraction of information, which include posts, location checkins, temporal records, is randomly sampled from Foursquare as the available infor-mation under the control of parameter  X  F 2 [0 , 1] and the remaining information are deleted. Meanwhile,  X  F propor-tion of the positive links are randomly sampled as the final positive link set and the remaining (1  X  F ) proportion of positive links are mixed with the negative links to form the final unlabeled link set: U F . A subset of links in U F are extracted as the reliable negative link set, RN F , with the spy technique. In a similar way, we can obtain the positive and reliable negative links in Twitter to be P T and RN T controlled by the sampling parameter  X  T 2 [0 , 1].
Supervised models, M F , built with P F and RN F , are applied to classify links in the test set, L F . Depending on the specific methods, features used to build the models can be di  X  erent and social meta path selection model MS F is applied to select the most useful social meta path based fea-tures (K is set as 7 in the experiment) to build model M F The predicted formation probabilities of links in L F will be used to update their link weights in Foursquare. Based on the updated aligned networks, supervised models, M T , built with P T and RN T , will be applied to classify links in the test set, L T , in which social meta path selection model MS is applied as well. And the predicted formation probabili-ties of links in L T will also used to update their weights in Twitter. Only the weights of potential social links in L and L T will be updated in each iteration and this process continues until the predicted formation probabilities of links in L T and L F converge.
To denote di  X  erent degrees of network newness, in Table 3, Table 3 has two parts: the upper part is the link prediction results in Foursquare and the lower part is that in Twitter, as Mli is an integrated PU link prediction framework. The link prediction results in each part are evaluated by di  X  erent metrics: AUC , Accuracy and F1 . As shown in Table 3, Mli can outperform all other comparison methods consistently Twitter network. For example, in Foursquare when  X  F = 0 . 5, the AUC achieved by Mli is about 5% better than LI , 15% better than SCAN , 19% better than SCAN-t and 73% better than SCAN-s ; the Accuracy achieved by Mli is about 2 . 3% better than LI , 8% better than SCAN ,9 . 1% higher than SCAN-t and over 40% higher than SCAN-s ; the F1 of Mli is 6 . 4% higher than LI , 18% higher than SCAN and SCAN-t and 36% higher than SCAN-s . When  X  F =0 . 5, the link prediction results of Mli in Twitter are also much better than all other baseline methods. For instances, in Twitter the AUC of Mli is 0 . 923  X  0 . 002, which is about 6% better than LI , over 13% better than SCAN , SCAN-t and over 40% better than SCAN-s . Similar results can be obtained when evaluated by Accuracy and F1 .

In Table 4, we fix  X  F =0 . 8 but change  X  T with values in where  X  F varies, Mli can beat all other methods in both Twitter and Foursquare when the degree of newness of the Twitter network changes.
 Mli can perform better than LI in both Foursquare and Twitter, which shows that predicting social links in multi-ple networks simultaneously in Mli framework can do en-hance the results in both networks; the fact that LI can beat SCAN shows that features extracted based on cross network meta paths can do transfer useful information for both an-chor and non-anchor users; SCAN works better than both SCAN-t and SCAN-s denotes that link prediction with in-formation in two networks simultaneously is better than that with information in one single network.
An important parameter that can a  X  ect the performance of all these methods is the rate of anchor links existing across networks. In this part, we will analyze the e  X  ects of the an-chor link rate,  X  A 2 [0 , 1 . 0]. To exclude other parameters X  interference, we fix  X  F and  X  T as 0 . 8 but change  X  A with results in both Foursquare and Twitter under the evalua-tion of AUC , Accuracy and F1 . The results are shown in Figure 5.

As shown in Figure 5, where Figures 5(a)-5(c) are the link prediction results in Foursquare and the Figures 5(d)-5(f) are those in Twitter, almost all the methods can per-form better as  X  A increases, except SCAN-t as it only uti-lizes information in the target network only. It shows that with more anchor links, Mli , LI , SCAN and SCAN-s can transfer much more information from other aligned source networks to the target network to enhance the results. In addition, Mli can work better than LI consistently as  X  A varies, which can show the e  X  ectiveness of Mli in dealing with networks with di  X  erent ratios of anchor links
Mli need to predict the links in all the aligned networks alternatively and iteratively until convergence. In this part, we will analyze whether Mli can converge as this process continues. We show the link prediction results achieved by Mli in both Foursquare and Twitter under the evaluation of AUC , Accuracy and F1 when  X  F ,  X  T and  X  A are all set as 0 . 8 in Figure 6. Figures 6(a)-6(c) are the results in Foursquare network from iteration 1 to iteration 30 and Figures 6(d)-6(f) are those in Twitter network. As shown in these figures, results achieved by Mli can converge in less than 10 itera-tions in both Foursquare and Twitter evaluated by all these three metrics.
Link prediction in online social networks first proposed by D. Liben-Nowell et al. [12] has been a hot research topic in recent years and many di  X  erent methods have been pro-posed. D. Liben-Nowell et al. [12] propose many unsu-pervised link predicators to predict the social connections among users. M. Hasan et al. [8] propose to predict links by using supervised learning methods. An extensive survey of other link prediction methods is available in [9, 7].
Meanwhile, some works have also been done on predicting multiple kinds of links simultaneously. I. Konstas et al. [11] propose to recommend multiple kinds of links with collabo-rative filtering methods. F. Fouss et al. [6] propose to use a traditional model, random walk, to predict multiple kinds of links simultaneously in networks. M. Bilgic et al. [1] pro-pose an approach to address two problems by interleaving object classification and link prediction in a collective algo-rithm. P. Domingos et al. [4] propose a unifying framework, Markov Logic, for collective classification problems in social networks.

PU learning techniques have been proposed for many years and have been widely used in many di  X  erent areas. B. Liu et al. [13] propose many di  X  erent settings to obtain the reliable negative instance set from unlabeled instances in text min-ing tasks. Y. Zhao et al. [28] propose to apply PU learning techniques to graph mining area.

Nowadays, the researchers X  focus start shifting to study multiple aligned heterogeneous online social networks simul-taneously. X. Kong et al. [10] are the first to propose the concept of  X  X ultiple aligned heterogeneous social networks X  and  X  X nchor links X  . They propose a two-phase method to predict the anchor links across networks. J. Zhang et al. [25] propose to transfer useful information across aligned networks to help predict social links for new users and they are the first to study social link prediction across aligned networks. J. Zhang et al. [26] propose to predict multiple kinds of links for new networks with information transferred across partially aligned networks and they are the first to study collective link prediction across partially aligned net-works. J. Zhang et al. also gives a survey about link predic-tion problems and methods across social networks in [27].
In this paper, we have studied the multi-network link pre-diction problems across partially aligned networks. An e  X  ec-tive general link prediction framework, Mli , has been pro-posed to solve the problem. Heterogeneous features can be extracted from the network based on both intra-network and inter-network social meta paths . Useful features are selected and transferred to aligned networks to enhance the predic-tion results mutually. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world aligned networks demonstrate that Mli can work very well in predicting social links in multiple partially aligned networks simultaneously.
