There were 307 papers submitted to PAKDD 2016 and they underwent a rigorous double blind review process. Each paper was reviewed by three Program Committee (PC) members and meta-reviewed by one Senior Program Committee (SPC) member who also conducted discussions with the reviewers. The Program Chairs then con-sidered the recommendations from SPC members, looked into each paper and its conference program and proceedings, resulting in an acceptance rate below 30 %, among which 39 papers were assigned as long presentation and 52 papers were Microsoft CMT system.

The conference started with a day of fi ve high-quality workshops and During the next three days, the Technical Program included 19 paper presentation mining contest, and three keynote talks by world-renowned experts.
We would like to thank all the Program Committee members and external reviewers for their hard work to provide timely and comprehensive reviews and recommenda-and Jinyan Li together with the individual Workshop Chairs for organizing the workshop program; Hisashi Kashima and Leman Akoglu together with the individual
We hope that participants in the conference in Auckland, as well as subsequent inspiring and rewarding.
 February 2016 James Bailey It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 20th Conference of the Paci Conference series on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. PAKDD has success-identifying challenging problems facing the development of advanced knowledge discovery. The 20th edition of PAKDD continues this tradition.

We are delighted to present three outstanding keynote speakers: Naren Ramakr-Venkatesh from Deakin University.

We are grateful to the many authors who submitted their work to the PAKDD Takashi Washio. A report on the paper selection process appears in the PC Chairs Preface.

We also thank the other Chairs in the organization team: Muhammad Asif Naeem and Yun Sing Koh and Ranjini Swaminathan for the local arrangements ensuring the conference runs smoothly.
 We are grateful to the sponsors of the conference, Auckland Tourism Events and Economic Development, and BECA, for their generous sponsorship and support, and the PAKDD Steering Committee for its guidance and Best Paper Award, Student Travel Award and Early Career Research Award sponsorship. We would also like to PAKDD 2016 and your time in Auckland, New Zealand.
