 In medical records, negative qualifiers, e.g. no or without, are commonly used by health practitioners to identify the absence of a medical condition. Without considering whether the term occurs in a negative or positive context, the sole presence of a query term in a medical record is insufficient to imply that the record is relevant to the query. In this paper, we show how to effectively handle such negation within a medical records information retrieval system. In particular, we propose a term representation that tackles negated lan-guage in medical records, which is further extended by con-sidering the dependence of negated query terms. We evalu-ate our negation handling technique within the search task provided by the TREC Medical Records 2011 track. Our results, which show a significant improvement upon a sys-tem that does not consider negated context within records, attest the importance of handling negation.

Search in the medical domain is notable for its extensive use of negated language within medical records [2]. How-ever, recently Koopman et al. [2] asserted that the use of term frequency in document weighting models such as BM25 automatically alleviates the problems of negated language. Notably, they argue that terms in negative contexts typ-ically appear once per medical record while, in contrast, terms indicating the presence of a medical condition (posi-tive terms) appear frequently. In this paper, we argue that a dedicated negation handling approach will outperform tra-ditional retrieval models for medical domain queries. Ad-ditionally, prior works have focused almost exclusively on negated language in queries rather than documents (e.g. boolean retrieval models or vector negation [7]). For exam-ple, for the query  X  X OT chest pain AND shortness of breath X , the boolean model will find documents not containing  X  X hest pain X , thereby not considering any negation occurring within the records. Moreover, most words indicating negation (e.g. no, not) are stopwords, which are not typically indexed [1].
To cope with negation in medical search, we propose a two-step process: a term representation approach, NegFlag , to facilitate the handling of negative context in medical records; and a novel term dependence approach to demote
There are two components in Equation (1), namely the positive scoring of positive query terms, and the negative term dependence score for the negated forms of the query terms. score ( r, t ) is the score assigned to a query term t in medical record r using any term weighting model, Q  X  is the set of negated forms of the positive query terms in Q , and  X  t , t 2  X  is a pair of negated terms in Q  X  . Two types of term dependence are possible [4, 5]: for full dependence (FD),  X  t , t 2  X  is the set that contains unordered pairs of neigh-bouring terms; for sequential dependence (SD),  X  t 1 , t 2  X  is the set that contains ordered pairs of neighbouring terms. For score ( r,  X  t 1 , t 2  X  ), we use the binomial randomness model pBiL [5] from the Divergence from Randomness (DFR) frame-work to score the occurrences of a pair of terms within window size t okens in a medical record r .
We evaluate our negated term representation and the term dependence approaches using the 34 topics from the TREC 2011 Medical Records track [6]. In this track, the task is to identify relevant patient visits for each topic, where a visit contains all of the medical records associated with that patients X  admission to the hospital. For indexing and re-and removing stopwords. The parameter-free DFR DPH term weighting model is used to rank medical records. The expCombSUM voting technique [3] is then used to rank vis-its based on the scores of their associated medical records. The number of voting medical records is limited to 5,000 as this was found to be effective in preliminary experiments. We hypothesise that negation should be explicitly handled, hence we compare our approach with a baseline where nega-tion is not explicitly handled, as suggested in [2].
Figure 1 shows the bpref retrieval performance compar-ing NegFlag, as well as the SD and FD variants of term dependence with NegFlag, and the baseline where negation is not handled. From Figure 1, we observe that our ap-proach employing either only NegFlag or both NegFlag and term dependence outperforms the baseline (bpref 0.4871), by up to 4%. Indeed, NegFlag alone markedly improves the retrieval performance over the baseline, while term depen-dence for window size = 3 using either SD or FD results in statistically significant improvements over the baseline (paired t-test, p &lt; 0 . 05).

For SD, small window size s are more effective, but perfor-mance is generally stable across different window size s , sug-gesting that the presence of negated ordered pairs anywhere in a medical record is sufficient to ascertain if it should be demoted. For FD, window size &gt; 3 degrades performance compared to NegFlag, but still outperforms the baseline.
Next, we further evaluate the effectiveness of our approach after applying a query expansion (QE) technique (namely DFR Bo1 from Terrier). Table 2 shows the retrieval perfor-mances (in terms of bpref, precision@10, and R-precision) of NegFlag, with SD and FD term dependence window size = 3 (identified best settings in Figure 1), as well as with-out term dependence, compared to a baseline applying only QE. The performances of the top 3 best systems at TREC 2011 are also reported. We observe that the QE baseline is outperformed by NegFlag for all the measures, however, h ttp://terrier.org
