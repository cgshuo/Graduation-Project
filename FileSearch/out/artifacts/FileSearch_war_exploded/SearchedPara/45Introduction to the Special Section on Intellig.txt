 The recent advance of pervasive computing technologies promises to significantly en-hance capabilities for data capture and data analysis. In this socially aware era, such technologies hold great promise and challenge for using the sensory data to under-stand human behavior, human mobility, human activities, and ultimately to help solve human social problems. The integration of pervasive computing and social computing has resulted in an emerging new research field in computer science X  X ocially Aware Computing. While the concept of social awareness has been developed in the field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work for decades, the notion of socially aware computation and communication has only recently been introduced by Alex Pentland [2005]. Socially Aware Computing brings light to the design of new software method-ology, infrastructure, data analysis, and applications. This paradigm aims to leverage the large-scale and diverse sensing devices that can be deployed in human daily lives to recognize individual behaviors, discover group interaction patterns, and support communication and collaboration.

Intelligent systems powered by artificial intelligence play an important role in re-alizing socially aware computing in various aspects, such as sensing, processing, and supporting human interaction. This special section aims to explore intelligent systems and related applications for socially aware computing. Submissions to this special is-sue came from an open call for papers. We received a total of 16 submissions of which 5 articles were accepted after three rounds of rigorous reviews. A large number of re-viewers assisted us in the review process. In order to ensure high reviewing standards, three to four reviewers evaluated each article.
 The five selected articles include a survey article and four original research articles. Included topics are pervasive social computing, location-based recommendation, tra-jectory annotation, mining, search, and mobile social networks.

The opening article of this special section,  X  X ervasive Social Context -Taxonomy and Survey X , authored by Daniel Schuster, Alberto Rosi, Marco Mamei, Thomas Springer, Markus Endler, and Franco Zambonelli is a survey of Pervasive Social Computing, the merging of pervasive computing and social networks. The authors define pervasive social context to be the information arising out of people using sensor-equipped pervasive devices as well as social networking services. The authors intro-duce a taxonomy to classify pervasive social context along the dimensions of space, time, people, and information source (STiPI) and comment on the reason for creating such context. Recent studies are reviewed to show the applicability and usefulness of the taxonomy in classifying and assessing applications and systems of Pervasive Social Computing. Some research challenges in this area are highlighted.
 The second article,  X  X ontrivial Landmark Recommendation using Geotagged Photos X , by Yue Shi, Pavel Serdyukov, Alan Hanjalic, and Martha Larson, presents an approach that exploits geotagged images from an online community for the purpose of recommending personalized landmarks. In contrast to existing studies, the article focuses on nontrivial recommendations. Recommendations of landmarks that are highly popular, frequently visited, or easily discovered through other information sources such as travel guides are avoided in favor of recommendations that relate to users X  personal interests. A collaborative filtering approach within a matrix factorization framework is adopted for recommendation. The approach is evaluated on a large collection of geotagged photos gathered from Flickr.
 In  X  X xploring Pattern-Aware Travel Routes for Trajectory Search X , Ling-Yin Wei, Wen-Chih Peng, and Wang-Chien Lee explore the problem of in-breadth and in-depth trip planning. Given a spatial range and a user preference of depth/breadth specified by a user, the authors develop a pattern-aware trajectory search (PATS) framework to retrieve the top-K trajectories passing through popular region of inter-ests (ROIs). The PATS framework consists of two parts: travel behavior exploration and trajectory search. The travel behavior exploration determines a set of ROIs along with their attractive scores by considering not only the popularity of the ROIs but also the travel sequential relationships among the ROIs. For the trajectory search, two trajectory score functions, the depth-trip score function and the breadth-trip score function, are defined, by taking into account the number of ROIs in a trajectory and their attractive scores. The Bounded Trajectory Search (BTS) algorithm is proposed to retrieve the top-K trajectories based on the two trajectory scores.

The fourth article,  X  X emantic Trajectories: Mobility Data Computation and Annota-tion X , written by Zhixian Yan, Dipanjan Chakraborty, Christine Parent, Stefano Spac-capietra, and Karl Aberer, presents a study on understanding the semantic behavior of moving objects. Semantic behavior refers to the use of semantic abstractions of raw mobility data, including not only geometric patterns but also knowledge extracted jointly from the mobility data and the underlying geographic and application domains. The authors propose a semantic model and a computation and annotation platform for developing a semantic approach that progressively transforms the raw mobility data into semantic trajectories enriched with segmentations and annotations.
 In the final article,  X  X onnecting People through Physical Proximity and Physical Resources at a Conference X , Alvin Chin, Bin Xu, Hao Wang, Lele Chang, Hao Wang, and Lijun Zhu investigate how to bridge the gap between offline and online behav-iors at a conference and how the physical resources in the conference can be used to help facilitate social networking. A system called Find &amp; Connect is built to integrate offline activities and interactions captured in real-time with online connections in a conference environment in order to provide a list of potential people with whom one should connect to form an ephemeral social network. As a result of two trials with two separate datasets, the authors obtained several interesting findings, such as social con-nections that are reciprocal in relationship such as friendship and exchanged contacts, have tighter, denser and highly clustered networks compared to unidirectional rela-tionships. The authors also found that there is a positive relationship between physical proximity encounters and online social connections before a social connection is made for friends (i.e., social selection is strong), but a negative relationship occurs after the social connection is made (i.e., social influence is weak).

The five selected articles capture some of the state-of-the-art research issues of in-telligent systems for socially aware computing. We hope that the key issues presented here will advance the discussion in the community towards social and community intelligence [Zhang et al. 2011]. We would like to thank Professor Qiang Yang, the Editor-in-Chief, for his great support and work throughout the whole publication pro-cess. We are also grateful to the referees for their professional and timely reviews. Last, but not least, we would like to express our appreciation to all the authors who submitted articles to this special section.
