 1. Introduction
Researchers taking the user-centered approach have explored how people think, perceive, behave and feel about information retrieval systems and the interaction process ( McCracken &amp; Wolfe, 2004 ). From a theoret-ical point of view, researchers have stressed that in studying human interactions with an information retrieval system it is important to find ways to access the underlying thoughts and cognitive processes of the user and affective states during interaction with an information retrieval system ( Dervin, 1983; Kuhlthau, 1993 ).
Many research studies have explored the effects of users X  cognitive behavior and affective reactions on their interaction with information systems. However, most of the studies focused on exploring either the cognitive dimension or the affective dimension. Fewer studies have investigated the relationship between cognitive behavior and affective reactions during the information searching process. Our current research is designed to fill this gap by exploring users X  affective feelings and cognitive behavior during the interaction with the
E-journal system ScienceDirect, and the relationship between their cognitive behavior and affective reactions. 2. Related literature
With the development of the user-centered approach to studying information systems and human X  computer interactions, abundant research has been done to study users X  behavior as they interact with different kinds of IR systems, from OPACs to Web search engines. Regarded as an inseparable part of observable sen-sorimotor behavior, the affective and cognitive dimensions of behavior have attracted much attention in recent decades.

Based on the constructive theory and a series of five empirical studies on information seeking, Kuhlthau proposed a six-stage model for the information search process (ISP). The six stages are: initiation, selection, exploration, formulation, collection, and presentation. In the ISP model, information seeking is viewed as a process of construction in which users progress from uncertainty to understanding. Kuhlthau argued that the whole information search process is an integration of three realms of human experience: the affective (feel-ings), the cognitive (thoughts), and the physical (actions) ( Kuhlthau, 1991, 1993 ).

The cognitive dimension of human behavior was recognized and widely explored in the early stages of dependency (as measured through the embedded figures test), on users X  reactions to information organization and representation, search strategy, and search performance ( Ellis, Ford, &amp; Wood, 1993; Ford, 2000; Ford,
Wilson, Foster, Ellis, &amp; Spink, 2002; Ford, Wood, &amp; Walsh, 1994; Palmquist &amp; Kim, 2000; Wang, Hawk, of information retrieval may be influenced to a considerable extent by factors other than cognition and tech-cognitive and physical behaviors when they used a Web search engine/directory to perform fully self-generated information seeking into their instruction model.

In their research comparing patterns of children X  X  and graduate students X  Web searching behavior, Bilal and Kirby (2002) investigated users X  cognitive, affective, and physical behavior as they completed a fact-find-ing task. The participants X  Web activities were captured by video. Children X  X  affective states were captured by exit interviews, and graduate students X  affective states were gleaned from the journals they wrote during the
Web traversal process. Searching effectiveness, efficiency, and the quality of Web moves made by each user during the search process were measured by the  X  X  X eb Traversal Measure X  X . The study found that graduate of their Web moves. Compared with children, graduate students were more capable of recovering from search-related  X  X  X reakdowns X  X  ( Bilal &amp; Kirby, 2002 ).

Wang et al. (2000) observed how users search for factual information on the Web. They presented a mul-tidimensional model of user X  X eb interaction as a framework for their empirical design. Twenty-four graduate students participated in the study. The study focused on cognitive, affective, and physical domains during the user X  X eb interactions in performing factual searches. Cognitive factors included the knowledge and skills needed to interact with the Web to find information, and cognitive style (measured using the Embedded
Figures Test (EFT)). Participants X  cognitive behaviors during the user-Web interactions were analyzed in terms of their question analysis, search strategies, problems and problem solving, and mental models. Affective factors were measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to indicate if the level of anxiety affected searching. They found that affective states changed as a result of interactions with the information system.
In addition, participants X  verbalizations of feelings were categorized into positive feelings and negative feel-ings. The authors found that negative feelings seemed to hinder or terminate further actions.

Nahl and Tenopir (1996) conducted an exploratory study to examine both the affective and cognitive searching behavior of novice end-users of a full text magazine database. Seven novice academic end users (fac-ulty and graduate students) participated in the study. Think-aloud protocol was used in the search process and the transaction logs were captured. By conducting an analysis of questions articulated during the search pro-cess, the authors found that affective questions outnumbered cognitive and sensorimotor questions by two to one. Affective-oriented questions primarily dealt with users X  need for continuing motivation to carry out their intentions in the moment-by-moment cognitive decision-making.

Pausing during searching is closely examined by Huang in her dissertation work (2003) . Her study identified reasons for pausing and pausing behaviors over time. In the text-based Dialog search environment, the most frequently occurred reasons were formulating queries, determining display syntax, selecting file/database, deciding on Boolean  X  X  X nd X  X , etc. As searchers became more experienced, they paused less frequently.
In recent years, researchers in the field of psychology studied the relationship between cognition and emotion, and their interplay. Most psychologists have abandoned the idea that thought and feeling are two separate realms that operate independently of one another. Instead, there is a growing consensus among psychologists that cognition and emotion have a profound effect on one another ( Eich, 2000 ). A conscious emotional state/response may serve as an index of implicit cognition (perception or memory) ( Kihlstrom,
Mulvaney, Tobias, &amp; Tobis, 2000 ). Norman (2004) argued that  X  X  X verything you do has both a cognitive and an affective component X  X ognitive to assign meaning, affective to assign value X  X .

In the field of information science, there is also a growing recognition among researchers that feeling/emo-tion and cognition are intimately linked. Buck (1985) characterized the cognitive domain as a  X  X  X eadout mode X  X  for the affective domain. In exploring the structure of information behavior, Nahl (1998b) found that the affec-tive component of information behavior affects the direction of cognitive processing through hierarchically organized goals, characterized by both an individual and a cultural component. Based on the reference service experience, Quinn (2003) found that how one feels can play a critical role in what and how one thinks; and similarly, the thinking processes that one engages in can make a significant difference in how one feels.
Some studies have explored the relationship between the affective and cognitive dimensions of information seeking behavior. Nahl and Meer (1997) compared the cognitive and affective reactions of 21 first semester library and information science graduate students who were new users of two Web browsers, Netscape 3 and IE3. They found that participants who had more positive self-efficacy expectations did equally well on both browsers, while users with lower self-expectations did less well with Netscape 3. The authors concluded that although the results reveal existing patterns of relations between affective variables (e.g., self-efficacy expectations, satisfaction) and cognitive variables (e.g., accurate sequencing of sub-tasks and interpretation of on-screen menus, labels, and instructions), they are difficult to interpret in a systematic way.
Nahl (1998a) reported on an ethnographic approach to monitoring college students X  developmental steps in acquiring experience with a Web search engine. In the study, participants were required to keep a log of their cumulative experience with the search engine, and keep weekly self-ratings on satisfaction scales and their between affective and cognitive domains. Nahl states that  X  X  X n actual search protocol consists of alternating affective and cognitive operations in which the affective function supplies the direction and the cognitive pro-vides the content X  X  ( Nahl, 1998a ).
 In an experimental study investigating students X  research anxiety and perceptions of the research process,
Kracker and Wang (2002) observed ninety undergraduate students completing a research project during a semester. Feelings and thoughts associated with the process were recorded at the beginning of the semester when the participants described a past memorable research-writing experience and at the end of the semester when the participants described the current research-writing experience for the course. The content analysis of the feelings revealed thoughts related to the research process and feelings (A total of 122 distinct affective words were used by the participants to describe feelings related to the research process). These feelings were further analyzed with their concurrent thoughts. Kracker and Wang found that there is a positive association between emotions and thoughts: most feelings were associated with more than one type of cognitive thought; and frequently mentioned feelings co-occurred with frequently mentioned thoughts ( Kracker &amp; Wang, 2002 ). 3. Research questions cess. Further, the relationship between cognitive actions and emotional states was explored in the context of retrieving simulated class-related topics in the ScienceDirect database. The specific research questions are as follows: 1. How do searchers interact with the system? 2. What feelings are mentioned during the search process? 3. What thoughts occur during the search process? 4. How are emotions associated with thoughts? 5. How can user X  X  interactions with Web-based information system be measured? 4. Research design 4.1. Participants
Participants were recruited from The University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Flyers were distributed in classes and posted in the science and engineering buildings on campus. E-mail and personal telephone contacts were made to reach potential participants. Participants were also asked to recommend other participants. All par-ticipants received a monetary compensation. A total of 41 faculty, students and librarians participated in the study. The participants consisted of Nine faculty members in the fields of chemistry, physics, astronomy, and engineering; Ten science graduate students (five Ph.D. and five Masters students); Ten science major undergraduate students;
Seven undergraduate students who had taken at least one science class and who were enrolled in a required public speaking class; and
Five science librarians in the University main library. 4.2. ScienceDirect and the lab setting
ScienceDirect, a Web-based electronic journals system from Elsevier, was used to search for information. It science. Some of the articles are available online in both PDF and HTML formats. As a Web-based IR system, ScienceDirect is a complex one with various search functions and features.

The Usability Lab at the College of Communication and Information, The University of Tennessee is par-titioned into two areas: (1) a test area and (2) an observation area, separated by a freestanding partition. The participant X  X  workstation consists of a Microsoft Windows-based personal computer and a laser printer, both of which are connected to the campus network. The test area also contains two small Pan/Tilt/Zoom video cameras. A floor camera, which is used to capture the participant X  X  facial expressions, is mounted on a tripod outside the participant X  X  main field of view. A ceiling-mounted camera is positioned behind the participant and is used to capture images of documents on the workstation table. Both cameras are controlled from the obser-vation area using a remote control device. Participants wear a wireless microphone so that their verbalizations can be captured as part of the think aloud protocol used in the study. All the participants used the same com-puter set-up and followed the same procedure as described in Section 4.3 below.
 The observation area houses the audio/video equipment used to capture and record the search sessions.
A scan converter captures the participant X  X  workstation screen display as an S-video signal. This signal is mixed with video from the floor camera to produce a picture-in-picture display of the participant X  X  screen with his or her face in a small foreground window. The mixer also combines audio from the participant X  X  micro-phone with the picture-in-picture video. The sessions are recorded in digital format using a dual format S-
VHS/MiniDV tape recorder. While digital tape recording produces high-quality results, use of the MiniDV format limits standard record time to 80 min per cartridge. However, the tape recorder also has a non-stan-dard LP recording mode which doubles the record time of the MiniDV cartridges should this be necessary.
Tape recordings of the test sessions are used to provide redundancy for the primary recordings which are made tape. For example, media files can be positioned more accurately than tape and can be repeatedly repositioned without degrading the recording.

A Windows-based workstation with a real-time MPEG encoder card is used to record the search sessions to media files. MPEG-2 encoding was chosen for high quality results and compatibility with the Observer Video-
Pro data-collection software from Noldus. 4.3. Procedure
Three trained graduate research assistants (RAs) collected data during 2003 X 2004. Each participant X  X  search session was administered by one RA. Before each session started, the RA introduced the project, its purpose, the lab setting, and the tasks; the RA further explained about voluntary participation and data con-fidentiality measures and asked the participant to sign the written consent form.

The session then began with the Kolb Learning Style Inventory, a standard psychological instrument for measuring individual differences. Learners are classified to one of four learning styles: accommodator, assim-ilator, converger, or diverger. Accommodators prefer  X  X  X ands-on X  X  experience and tend to put ideas into action and practice relying on  X  X  X ut X  X  feelings rather than logical analysis. In contrast, assimilators prefer putting information into a concise and logical framework or structure and tend to think things through. Convergers enjoy relating theory to real world situations and tend to be technical. Divergers prefer to look at a situation from multiple perspectives and tend to be imaginative and open-minded.

Following the Kolb Inventory, the participant was given two known-item searches to practice to get famil-iar with the setting and the Web browser while the RA stood by. This warm-up session was not recorded.
After the two practice searches, the browser was reset to the ScienceDirect homepage and the recording started. The participant was given a task scenario and asked to select a search topic. The search scenario for undergraduates was to select a search topic from a pool of predefined simulated class-related topics.
The search scenario for graduate students was research-oriented topics either from the topic pool or from their course assignment.

Each participant described the topic in writing and moved onto searching. The participant was reminded to verbalize thoughts that occurred while he or she interacted with the system. The RA withdrew from the par-ticipant X  X  area so that the participant could interact freely and independently with the system.
Upon completing the search, the participant filled out a questionnaire which solicited a brief description of the topic, comments on the ScienceDirect system, and experience of the search process. 5. Data analysis
The collected data include (1) demographic data, including gender, academic standing, and major field of study; (2) Kolb learning style; (3) audio X  X ideo recording of actual search transactions along with concurrent verbalization; (4) pre-and post-search descriptions of the search topic; and (5) post-search questionnaire. 5.1. Data handling
Each participant X  X  digital recording includes keystrokes and continuous screenshots with synchronous ver-balization. Actions (moves) and verbalizations were transcribed respectively into two text files: one includes the participant X  X  actions/moves and the other verbalized thoughts and feelings.

The software Observer Video-Pro was used to mark the searching process into analytical units and output transcripts. Each analytical unit is a Webpage. When a participant moved from one Web page to another, one using the time stamp generated automatically by Observer. The action files start at the point the searching ment. The term  X  X  X age state X  X  refers to one of the sub-interfaces or information spaces in ScienceDirect. At any specific moment during a search session, the searcher is in a specific ScienceDirect state or Web page: Home,
Results, Document, Abstract, etc. The comment field is for the analyst to add notes such as the number of hits, participant X  X  actions, navigational behavior, document usage, error descriptions, and other related informa-tion. The transcripts were saved as text files and imported into an MS Access database for quantitative ana-lysis and to QSR NUD * IST for qualitative analysis.

The verbal files used the same analytical unit IDs generated by the Observer. Thus thoughts and feelings are linked to the analytical units. We used the software QSR NUD ing unit is the same analytical unit defined above and each unit is assigned appropriate codes to describe thoughts and feelings. The codes are organized hierarchically. 5.2. Affective coding
A list of 114 words and phrases describing emotional feelings was identified from the 41 transcripts. The words and phrases were categorized based on their semantic similarities and distances For example,  X  X  X ertain X  X , that feeling is generally associated with value judgments ( Norman, 2004 ). These words express carelessness and are not associated with any value judgment. Altogether, 10 categories of affective codes were generated from the grouping activity. To assist data analysis, the 10 categories were further grouped into three types: entire affective coding list.)
The following quotations are examples from the transcripts which show different feelings. The affective code assigned is in the square brackets following the quotation.

Examples of Positive feelings:
Example of a Neutral response:
Examples of Negative responses: 5.3. Cognitive coding
Based on the examination of the transcripts, four categories of cognitive thoughts were identified. These are  X  X  X ystem X  X ,  X  X  X earch Strategy X  X ,  X  X  X earch Results X  X , and  X  X  X ask X  X .

The first category,  X  X  X ystem X  X , concerns system-related cognitive thoughts. When users come to an IR sys-and functions are designed based on the system designer X  X  conceptual model of the system, there can be a gap between the actual system model and participants X  expectations. This gap can cause problems when users interact with the system. By examining users X  actions of looking for system options and speculation on system operations, the first category explores what users expect about the system, what problems they have with the system, and how they resolve conflicts during their interaction with the system.

The second category is  X  X  X earch Strategy X  X  and is concerned with cognitive thoughts related to users X  search strategies. Some examples are creating search strategies, changing search mode, and refining search strategies. This category aims to investigate the negotiation strategies and process between participants and the system. The third category,  X  X  X earch Results X  X , is concerned with cognitive thoughts pertaining to search results.
The ultimate purpose of using an IR system is to find relevant materials to satisfy people X  X  emergent informa-tion needs. Knowing how users evaluate and use search results may inspire improved results display and better human computer communication design.

The last category,  X  X  X ask X  X , is composed of task-related cognitive thoughts. It includes the mental actions of performing a task, understanding a task, and completing a task. Situational, environmental, and setting fac-researchers track the development of users X  understanding of the tasks. The cognitive coding list is attached as Appendix B at the end of the article. The text units were coded at the category level.

The above cognitive categories each have four to six subcategories ( Appendix B ). For example, the cogni-tive coding about  X  X  X ystem X  X  has four subcategories: (1)  X  X  X ooking for a system option X  X ; (2)  X  X  X peculating on system operation X  X ; (3)  X  X  X ystem problems X  X ; and (4)  X  X  X ser problems with system X  X . Frequencies at the subcat-egory level are not reported here, but the following examples are provided:
System example:
Search Results example:
Search Strategy example:
Task example: 5.4. Coding reliability
We used a cross-coding method to ensure coding reliability. Measures of intercoder agreement for both affective and cognitive coding were calculated using the formula in Kracker and Wang (2002) . The formula is where M is the number of coding events agreed upon by all cross-coders, N assigned by the i th coder, and n is the number of coders.

For the affective coding, one coder assigned affective codes to all the transcripts. Two other cross-coders coder agreement for affective coding was 65% at the category level (positive, negative, and neutral categories).
Two cognitive coders each coded half of the transcripts with a set of five overlapping files. Cognitive coding reliability was calculated based upon the coding agreement of the five overlapping files, using the same for-mula employed to calculate affective coding agreement. Cognitive coding agreement at the categorical level reached 81%. Quantitative statistics related to cognitive coding which are discussed in this report are based upon the four main cognitive categories. 6. Results and discussion 6.1. Measurement of verbalization
Participants X  tendency to verbalize their thoughts and emotions was measured by the ratio of the tran-to verbalize more than other participants. Ironically, speech undergraduates were the least verbal group. Over-all, the participants were able to verbalize their thoughts and feelings during the interaction. 6.2. Users X  interaction with the system 6.2.1. Session length, pace of interaction, and number of pauses
The interaction is measured in terms of session length, pace of interaction (the number of pages per min-ute), and pause, which is slightly different from the measures first reported in Tenopir, Wang, and Pollard (2004) . Session length is the time from the start to the end of the search. Pace of interaction is the ratio of the number of visited pages to session length, which indicates the tempo of movement during the sessions.
A pause is defined as a timelag which is more than twice the mean timelag between two consecutively visited pages.

For the 41 participants, the mean search session length is 25 min, the mean pace is close to 2 pages per min-ute, and the mean number of pauses is 4 ( Table 2 ). Broken down by academic status, the mean session length from the shortest to the longest is: faculty, librarians, undergraduates, and graduates. Due to uneven distri-bution by academic status and discipline (the small number of participants in certain cells, e.g., one physics faculty and two physics graduate students), the comparison of disciplinary differences can only be made when the stratified groups have at least four participants. Two groups spent substantially more time on their ses-sions: engineering graduates and speech undergraduates. Within the same discipline (engineering), graduate students spent more time than faculty.

The mean pace of interaction ranges between 1 and 2 pages per minute. The order of pace (lowest to high-est) by academic status is librarians, faculty, undergraduates, and graduates. The two groups that had longer average session lengths have different paces X  X ngineering graduate students X  pace is slower than the grand mean, while speech undergraduates X  pace is the fastest of all groups.

Pausing behavior by academic status in the order from least to most is faculty, followed by librarians, undergraduates, and graduates. The mean number of pauses for Chemistry undergraduates is noticeably less than for other undergraduates. 6.2.2. Locations of pauses and reasons for pausing
Measuring pauses during the search process reveals reasons for deviating from normal paces. As Table 2 shows, the variations in paces across different groups are relatively small, but the number of pauses varied for the four main groups X  X raduates paused twice as much as faculty. The number of pauses only provided states) and it is found that the majority of the pauses occurred at document page or search results ( Table 3 ).
To identify the various reasons or situations that caused pausing, the transcripts surrounding pausing loca-tions were analyzed. The reasons for pausing derived from the transcripts are listed below in the order of frequency of occurrence: 1. Reading article (19). 2. Evaluating search results (15).
 10. Looking for a system option (3). 11. System problems (3). 12. Reading help or instructions (2).

The list shows that participants paused when they were dealing with system, search strategy, search results, and task. The revealed reasons for pausing verified the fact that many pauses occurred on Document and
Search Results page. On the Document page, participants were reading articles; on the Search Results page, search mode. Reasons 9 X 12 in the list are system related. Usually participants paused when they had problems with the system, for example, looking for system options and reading help. Participants also paused to under-stand tasks. 6.3. The association between learning styles and interaction
Due to uneven distribution of learning styles across groups, only the engineering graduates group has at least three participants in each of two learning types. None of the other groups has more than one subgroup
For engineering graduate students, the participants with the assimilating learning style searched longer, moved 4 ). With regard to the locations of pauses, those with the converging learning style paused more on Document pages and Home page than those with the assimilating learning style; the latter paused more on Search Result pages. Although learning style might affect interaction behaviors, the collected data cannot provide evidence ferent disciplines. Thus, the effect of learning style might have been factored into discipline. 6.4. Feelings and thoughts during the search process 6.4.1. Feelings during the search process
As described in Section 5.2 , the emotional feelings articulated by users during the search process are orga-nized into three main categories: Positive, Neutral, and Negative (see also Appendix A ). Positive and negative
Graduate physics students had less negative feelings than any other group ( Table 6 ). 6.4.2. Thoughts during the search process
Thoughts during the search process are related to  X  X  X ystem X  X ,  X  X  X earch Strategy X  X ,  X  X  X earch Results X  X , and  X  X  X ask X  X . As Table 7 shows, the verbalized thoughts are mostly related to search results or search strategies: the most frequently-occurring thoughts were related to search results (mean 12.76 mentions); the next most frequently-occurring thoughts were related to search strategy (mean 9.22 mentions); the much less fre-quently-mentioned thoughts were about the system (mean 3.96 mentions) or the task (mean 2.78 mentions).
It was also observed that fewer participants mentioned the system. This observation also applies to individual groups such as faculty. 6.4.3. Co-occurrence of feelings and thoughts
The analysis of the co-occurrences of feelings and thoughts is aimed at revealing the types of thoughts that evoke feelings. Following are some examples:
Example of positive feelings associated with cognitive thoughts about the System :
Example of negative feelings associated with System cognitive thoughts :
Example of positive feelings associated with Search Strategy :
Example of negative feelings associated with Search Strategy :
Example of positive feelings associated with Search Results :
Example of negative feelings associated with Search Results :
Example of positive feelings associated with Task :
Example of negative feelings associated with Task :
Both positive and negative feelings occurred most often with thoughts about search results, with positive feelings more frequently reported than negative feelings ( Table 8 ). Negative feelings co-occurred more often with thoughts related to system, search strategies, and the task than did positive feelings. 7. Conclusions
This study observed 41 academic searchers X  interactions with ScienceDirect under simulated-task scenarios in a lab setting. During the interactions, the searchers verbalized their thoughts and feelings. The screen actions and verbalizations were recorded in digital video and audio files. The processes and verbalizations were transcribed and analyzed to reveal interaction behaviors, measured by session length, pace, and pause; feelings, categorized into positive, negative and neutral; and thoughts, related to system, search strategy, results, and task.

The 41 academic searchers were faculty, students, and librarians from disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and engineering, and an undergraduate speech class. The interaction behavior is measured by three variables: session length X  X he search time between start and end; pace X  X atio of the number of pages to session length; pause X  X efined as a timelag between two recorded actions that is at least twice as long as the average time lag.
The results show that the mean session length is 25 min (standard deviation 14 min), mean pace is 2 pages per minute (standard deviation 1 min), and mean number of pauses is 4 (standard deviation 3 times). The partic-ipants paused to read; view, evaluate, or manipulate results; form or refine search strategy; rethink the search task; change or look for system alternatives; solve problems; and consult online help.
 During the interactions, both feelings (626 mentions) and thoughts (998 mentions) occurred frequently.
Positive feelings were verbalized more frequently than negative feelings: 352 vs. 269. Thoughts were mostly related to search strategies (332 mentions) and results (472 mentions). Feelings co-occurred most with thoughts on search results. The positive feelings were associated more often with thoughts on results than were negative feelings. Negative feelings seemed to co-occur more often with thoughts related to system, search strategy, and task than did positive feelings.

Our data limited our examination of learning styles as a factor influencing behavior due to the uneven dis-tribution of different learning styles in each academic-discipline group: many cells had only one or two par-ticipants. The group of engineering graduate students is the only one that has two learning styles with at least three participants: four with an assimilating learning style and three with the converging learning style.
The former searched longer, moved slightly faster, and paused slightly fewer times, while the latter paused more on document and much less on results. Further studies are needed to observe if learning style plays a significant role in searching behavior.

The most significant result of this study is the methodological implementation of measuring physical inter-actions and identifying associated thoughts and feelings. The lab setting enabled recording of three dimensions of Web-user interaction: (1) physical temporal interactions between the user X  X  actions and the system X  X  responses; (2) thoughts verbalized concurrently; (3) feelings verbalized concurrently. The recorded data are analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitative data measure the physical interactions in terms especially at the time of pausing. Pausing behavior along with feelings and thoughts during the process can provide effective clues to problems the searcher encounters. Intelligent information retrieval systems should integrate the quantitative measures such as pace and pause to better understand users and to effectively iden-tify potential problems to provide needed help. In that regard, pausing should be measured individually based on the individual X  X  pace.

This study adopted mixed-method in data collection and analysis. The quantitative measures were not intended for generalizing findings. Rather, by measuring interactions we effectively identified the temporal points to zoom in. It is then the qualitative data that we can rely on to interpret behaviors. The mixed-method results in rich and informative data although this type of study is time-consuming and labor-inten-sive in both data collection and analysis. Based on our results, we recommend a modified design that can reduce the amount of collected data but still achieve the same goals. The modified design will solicit verbal-izations only when the searcher pauses. As technology advances, we can incorporate additional measure-ments, such as eye movement, facial expression, and gesture, to study human X  X omputer interaction behaviors.
