 the potential applications will be introduced. Masaru Kitsuregawa is the recipient of the 20 09 SIGMOD Edgar F. Codd Innovations Award for contributions to high-performance database technol ogy. Kitsuregawa made major contributions to the development of hash-join algorithms, which signifi cantly improved the performance of join operations including the Functional Disk System and multi-node PC clusters, demonstrating its substantial advantages through detailed evaluations. He has also applied hash-based strategies to parallel association mining and showed its effectiveness there. His contributions in the hardware area include a high-speed sorting system with a sophisticated memory management algorithm. That work was eventually commercialized in collaboration with colleagues, and won the Datamation sort benchmark in 2000.
