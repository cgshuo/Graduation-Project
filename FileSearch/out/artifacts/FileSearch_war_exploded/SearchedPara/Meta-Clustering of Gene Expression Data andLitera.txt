 The current tendency in the life sciences to spawn ever grow-ing amounts of high-throughput assays has led to a situa-tion where the interpretation of data and the formulation of hypotheses lag the pace at which information is produced. Although the first generation of statistical algorithms scru-tinizing single, large-scale data sets found their way into the biological community, the great challenge to connect their results to existing knowledge still remains. Despite the fairly large number of biological databases that is currently avail-able, a lot of relevant information is found in free-text for-mat (such as textual annotations, scientific abstracts and full publications). In this paper we explore how an inte-grated analysis of expression data and literature-extracted information can reveal biologically meaningful clusters not identified when using microarray information alone. The joint analysis is validated in terms of transcriptional regula-tion.
 Data fusion, Expression analysis, Text Mining Concurrent with the swelling amounts of data that are nowa-days produced by high-throughput technologies, grows the amount of hypotheses and information they bring about. In-tegrating data from a single experiment with various other types of information, including sequence, protein structure, gene function or disease associations, could leverage the value of an experiment significantly. Indeed, as (1) the cost of data collection is high, (2) measurements are often noisy or unreliable and (3) established relationships in the tran-scriptome or proteome are fragmentary at best, a deeper integration of various information sources will benefit the knowledge discovery process. In practice, a successful un-derstanding of complex genetic mechanisms (such as regula-tion, functional understanding,...) critically depends on the interaction between statistical analysis and various knowl-edge sources, such as annotations databases, specialized lit-erature and curated cross-links between them [2]. Despite these efforts, the current interaction between experimental how we evaluate our setup in motif space. In Section 6 we show how clustering the integrated data-text representa-tion contributes positively to the analysis of gene expression data. We further discuss these results and their implications in Section 7. Typically, the current expert X  X  environment is composed of a data world which encompasses high-throughput data and statistical methods on the one hand, and a knowledge world, which contains existing domain information dominantly present in free-text form on the other hand. Within this terminol-ogy, data analysis is increasingly shifting towards a deep interaction of human expertise with those two worlds. To increase the efficiency of such interaction, we aim at over-coming the artificial separation of the two worlds (i.e., sepa-ration between tools for data analysis and those for informa-tion retrieval) by using domain literature in the same way as expression data, after transformation of textual domain knowledge into a suitable numerical format. In Figure 1 we give an overview of our approach: starting from a lit-erature repository we compute a document index based on the vector space model which results in a document-term matrix. For each gene we summarize all documents that are linked to it (e.g., as query results from PUBMED or as entries in a curated gene-literature repository) by merging the associated information. Having all genes represented in term vector space (indicated as ( a ) in Figure 1), we mathe-matically combine the text profiles with values in the gene expression matrix of a microarray experiment (indicated as ( b ) in Figure 1). This combination can be performed ei-ther by pooling the feature vectors from expression and text space or by combining the corresponding (possibly trans-formed) distance matrices. Further on we will show that in some cases there exists an equivalence between these ways of combining data. Subsequently, we cluster the augmented data structure and validate our approach in motif space (in-dicated as ( c ) in Figure 1) by scoring and comparing various resulting solutions to the ones where solely expression data is used. In what follows we will introduce the case study and specify the information sources used.
 Our text-based information source consists of a literature index for yeast genes constructed from a corpus of 24,909 yeast-related MEDLINE abstracts. These abstracts and their gene associations were extracted from the curated lit-erature references available in the Saccharomyces Genome Database 1 as of 11 Jan 2003. Central to the theme of this paper is the gene expression experiment. We use the yeast expression data from Cho et al. [9][39]. From the 3000 variance-normalized expression profiles, we withhold those 1745 that had literature references and therefore text pro-files. To check whether choosing this subsample of genes puts a bias on our findings, we calculate the linear correla-tion between the a priori chance to find a motif in this set of genes versus the a priori chance to find a motif over the en-tire genome. We obtain a value of 0.998, ensuring that the gene selection procedure does not deeply change the mo-tif composition in the gene set. Similar observations hold http://www.yeastgenome.org number of documents containing term j in the collection. The logarithm is often called inverse document frequency (IDF). Each w ij in the vector of document i is a weight for term j from the vocabulary. This representation is often re-ferred to as bag-of-words . In this paper we confine ourselves to the IDF weighting scheme, as it turned out to be a rea-sonable choice for modelling pieces of text comprising about 500 terms. We express similarity between pairs of docu-ments as the cosine of the angle between the corresponding normalized vector representations. The underlying hypoth-esis states that high similarity between documents testifies to a strong semantic connection between them.
 Both the scale and diversity of the information contained in the MEDLINE database form a barrier to a fast, func-tional interpretation of groups of genes. Retrieving litera-ture that deals specifically with gene function does in fact constitute a research topic on its own (see e.g., Leonard et al. [24] and the newly established TREC Genomics Track 2 ). A well-selected corpus, together with a domain-or problem-oriented vocabulary on the other hand, already alleviates this problem in a first approximation. Therefore we con-sider all MEDLINE abstracts that are referred to in SGD X  X  literature database as an acceptable, noise-free and domain-specific source of information. As the information covered in this subset is still immensely vast, we choose a domain-specific vocabulary that acts as a perspective to the liter-ature. Although a corpus-derived vocabulary might be the first logical choice in a vector-based text mining approach, we construct a tailored vocabulary based on the Gene On-tology 3 (GO). Restricted vocabularies are also suggested in Stephens et al. [40] and more recently in Chiang et al. [8]. As GO is a dynamic controlled hierarchy of terms with a wide coverage in life science literature, we consider it an ideal source to extract a highly relevant and relatively noise-free domain vocabulary. The Porter stemmer [12] is used to canonize plurals and conjugations, and the domain vocab-ulary is additionally crafted by (a) chopping long entries such as  X  X e-entry into mitotic cell cycle after pheromone ar-rest (sensu Saccharomyces) X  into smaller components such as  X  X e-entry X ,  X  X itotic cell cycle X  and  X  X heromone arrest X  ac-cording to hand-made rules and by (b) further pruning re-sulting terms that occur less than twice and more than five thousand times. As a term space for each document in the collection, we hence obtain a vocabulary consisting of 15,057 (possibly multi-word) GO-extracted terms.
 With a literature index for each document in the collection at hand, we summarize, for each gene, the text indices of all documents that are linked to it (in our case: via SGD X  X  curated gene-literature repository). The textual profile of agene i is then a vector of terms j obtained by taking the average over the N i indexed documents to which it is linked: This operation pools the keyword information contained in all documents related to a gene into a single vector (see ( a ) in Figure 1)). For gene CLN1, for example, this would yield terms as  X  X yclin X ,  X  X 1 X ,  X  X ell cycle X ,  X  X ud X  and  X  X dk X  as top scoring terms. We refer to Glenisson et al. [16][17] for http://medir.ohsu.edu/  X  genomics/ http://www.geneontology.org see that the various metabolic processes (fatty acids, glyco-sylation, methionine metabolism, nutrition and secretion) are clustered closely together. This is no surprise since metabolism is a highly integrated process. Individual meta-bolic pathways are linked into complex networks through common, shared substrates. Additionally, the majority of these processes (oxidative phosphorylation, the citric acid cycle, amino acid catabolism and fatty acid oxidation) share the same subcellular location, namely the mitochondrion. Cell cycle control, mitotic exit (one of the key events in the cell cycle) and the formation of pseudohyphae (a re-sponse to nitrogen starvation that is tightly controlled at the G1/S transition of the cell cycle) are closely related as expected. The processes of DNA repair and sporulation are also linked together, most probably because a number of proteins (RAD proteins), which are implicated in post-replication repair and damage-induced mutagenesis, are also required for sporulation by modulating the chromatin struc-ture via histone ubiquitination.
 To understand which features (terms) contribute most to the coherence of a functional group, we illustrate the top 15 mean terms for the IDF text representation in Table 2. For instance, for the cell cycle control group the most rel-evant terms are  X  X yclin X ,  X  X ell cycle (regulation) X ,  X (protein) kinase X ,  X  X 1 X ,  X  X dk X  and  X  X itosis X . These indeed are very relevant terms in the context of the cell cycle since cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk X  X ) control the passage of a cell through the cell cycle and the G1 and M (mitosis) phase are two of the four phases that make up the cell cycle. DNA repair, on the other hand, is a process that minimizes cell killing, mutations, replication errors, persistence of DNA damage and genomic instability due to recombinations. This is reflected in the relevant terms we find for this group such as  X (DNA/mismatch/recombination) repair X ,  X  X NA damage X  and  X  X eplication X .
 Having shown how the text representation interrelates groups of genes, quantifies for functional enrichment and provides term-based summaries, we state that this type of textual data can be placed on equal footing with other types of data, most notably expression data. One important ques-tion that arises when using expression data and textual in-formation interchangeably (for example in data fusion), is in which aspects the two data types differ. While expression data tends to favor clusters of co-expression (e.g., phases in the cell-cycle), textual data on the other hand enlightens a more functional dimension of a gene group. In the next sec-tion we will treat how we integrate both data types into an augmented data structure. With multiple information sources simultaneously available, it is a challenging question how to conduct integrated ex-ploratory analyses of microarray data with the aim of ex-tracting more information than from the expression mea-surements alone. More specifically, we wish to investigate how combining text-based information (essentially captur-ing functional relatedness) with expression data (registering co-expression) can add biological significance to the over-all clustering analysis. Here we propose two ways of data combination (see b in Figure 1). Both belong to a class of integration methods sometimes referred to as  X  X ntermediate X  Figure 4: Histograms of mutual gene distances in expression space (left) and text space (right) every two genes i,j we can then compute that where the square brackets denote a horizontal concatenation of the rowvectors and C =  X  1  X   X  . This means that in case of 1  X  cos distance, we can see  X   X  C as a scaling constant between the norms of the data-and text representations. The choice for  X  is typically governed by the confidence at-tributed to either of the two data types. However, even when distance measures span the same range, some caution is required. In Figure 4 we plot the histograms of all mu-tual distances for the data and text representations. We observe a much sharper distribution towards 1 for the text-based distances, meaning that, for example,  X  =0 . 5does not correspond to an equal contribution of both sources in the mixed representation. Rather, this setting will favor the expression data over the text representation. Although not necessarily detrimental, this scaling issue invokes additional problems on the transparency of  X  (see also Section 6) as most choices will appear increasingly ad hoc given this ob-servation.
 To overcome some of the scaling problems introduced in pre-vious section, we transform all entries in the distance matri-ces D to p -values by computing one-sided cumulative distri-bution function (cdf) values for each distance value in both representations. Once p -values are available, we are freed from the distribution of the data they are generated from and we can apply tools (called omnibus procedures) from meta-analysis, that encompass a set of classical statistical techniques to combine evidence from multiple sources [28]. We use Fisher X  X  omnibus method to combine the p -values derived for each expression-based and text-based distance. The combined statistic follows a  X  2 -distribution and we use the resulting p -values as entries in the combined distance matrix. We note that this method can be generalized by adding weights analogous to  X  , but we do not further explore this option in this manuscript. sentations of all motifs in each cluster, we assume that The proposed heuristic balances between these three criteria andisdefinedasfollows:
M-score = 1 k where f { 1 ..M } X  i is the number of (significantly) found mo-tifs contained in cluster i , f { 1 ..k } j is the (significant) occur-rences of motif j over all k clusters and P ( i,j )the p -value for the motif j in cluster i .Thetermlog( M f seen as an inverse motif frequency , while log( k f be considered as an inverse cluster frequency , analogous to weighting scheme terminology in Section 3. They smoothly disfavor groupings with clusters containing too much signifi-cant motifs (typically if a cluster is too large) and groupings in which motifs are too much distributed over all clusters (typically if clusters are too small). The formulated assump-tions that underpin the heuristic constitute a simplification of reality and therefore the M-score cannot be seen as an absolute quantification of biological relevance.
 Nevertheless, when exploring the effect of multiple cluster-ing parameterizations and algorithms in terms of detecting regulatory patterns over an entire data set, it provides useful clues for further investigation. Figure 5, for example, shows the behavior of the M-score over the number of clusters, k for yeast microarray data. Ward X  X  hierarchical clustering was applied on the 1  X  cos distance matrix stemming from the variance-normalized expression data described in Section 2. We see maximum values around k =12, indicating this is the parameter region of interest in terms of motifs. In work published elsewhere we discuss more extensively how regions around this value of k yield good biological clusters. In this work, however, we are less interested in determining optimal k in motif space. Rather, our focus is more on the differ-ence between cluster results generated by purely expression data versus clusters originating from text-augmented data representations. In the next Section, the M-score is used to explore these differences and is connected to a biological discussion. As gene expression data is inherently noisy and often er-roneous, we wish to examine how its joint analysis with functional information embedded in the literature, can ex-tract information not apparent when using solely the mi-croarray experiment. We test how clustering the augmented representations, presented in Section 4, improves the gene Figure 6: Motif Scores of hierarchical clusterings for vari-ous cutoffs k , applied on expression matrices ( x -axis) versus combined expression/text distance matrices ( y -axis). Both data types were integrated by calculating the linear combi-nation of the distances with  X  =0.5. We note that in prac-tice this setting boils down to using the text as a prior, not equivalent information source. pression data and text-augmented data. Briefly, the authors use the distribution of pairwise similarity between cluster-ings of subsamples of a data set as a measure of cluster stability. We have chosen this method for its exploratory nature and its ability to exploit the computational advan-tages of hierarchical clustering as outlined above. To make their method work with increased efficiency on genome-wide expression data, we apply it in two iterations: firstly, we determine an initial number of stable gene clusters which hardly exceeds five, even in the most liberal analysis (re-sults not shown). Secondly, we apply the stability method on each of these gene clusters yielding the stability diagrams plotted in Figure 8 and 9. For the expression data we liber-ally estimate an  X  X ptimal X  k = 18, for combined data we find k = 14. The Rand index [20], which quantifies the difference between pure data and text-augmented clustering attains a value of 0.857 indicating a pronounced difference. We note that, although the stability procedure can be applied in dif-ferent ways (e.g., in more than two iterations and starting from smaller k ), we converged to similar results. For the clustering on pure data, 18 clusters are obtained of which five show a periodic profile and an enrichment of relevant motifs (see Figure 10): Cluster 16 is characterized by the occurrence of ECB motifs (Early cell Cycle Box), specific for the M/G1 phase [42][39] and Met31-32p motifs, involved in the biosynthesis of methionine and specific for the S phase [42]. The expression profile (Figure 12) con-firms the observed phase specificity, peaking from the late S to the M phase. Additionally, the cell cycle specificity, the observed phase-specificity and the motif results for this cluster are supported by the text profile of the cluster with high-scoring terms such as  X  X ethionine X  (Met31-32p),  X  X ell cycle X ,  X  X ud X ,  X  X pindle pole body X ,  X  X NA replication X ,  X  X CM X  and  X  X inetochore X  (ECB) (see Appendix). In the S phase, DNA replication takes place, small buds develop and spin-dle formation starts. In the M phase spindle assembly takes place and the buds reach full size. Cluster 13 shows an en-richment of the G1/S-specific MCB (Mlul cell Cycle Box) and Mbp1 motifs. The latter is related to DNA replication and repair. The phase specificity is confirmed by the ex-pression and text profiles of the cluster and by the results of Tavazoie et al. [42] and Lee et al. [23]. High-scoring terms such as  X  X yclin X ,  X  X ell cycle X ,  X  X ud X ,  X  X 1 X ,  X  X ismatch repair X  and  X  X NA replication X  are related to the presence of MCB and Mbp1 motifs. Cluster 11 shows enrichment for binding motifs for the Fkh2 and Ndd1 transcription factors, which are known to cooperate during the G2 phase to acti-vate mitosis [23]. The text profile of the cluster reflects the presence of observed motifs with high-scoring terms such as  X  X itosis X ,  X  X ell cycle X ,  X  X heckpoint X ,  X  X xit X ,... . Other peri-odic clusters with relevant motifs are cluster 12 (MATA + ICRE) and cluster 3 (Ace2). Additionally, the clustering on pure data yielded three non-periodic clusters with relevant motifs: cluster 1 (GCN4), cluster 8 (Rap1) and cluster 10 (M3b + M13) (results not shown in detail).
 The integrated clustering resulted in 14 clusters, of which three more or less periodic and four non-periodic contain relevant motifs (see Figure 11). Since the expression pro-files represent the data, it was to be expected that the ex-pression profiles of the integrated clustering are more dif-fuse and the phase-specificity of the clusters is less obvious. Thiscanbeseeninclusters3and4,whichcontainamix of cell-cycle specific genes of different phase-specificity (see Figure 12). Cluster 3 contains the genes involved in spin-dle pole body formation and assembly (see Figure 13) while cell-cycle specific genes involved in DNA replication and re-pair are grouped in cluster 4 (see Figure 14). However, the former does not correspond to cluster 16 of the data clus-tering. It groups a small number of spindle related genes from cluster 16 with those of clusters 11 and 15, meaning that although the phase specificity of the expression profile of the cluster decreases, the functional coherence improves by adding text. The latter largely corresponds to cluster 13 of the data clustering. As the formation, duplication and assembly of spindle pole bodies are not limited to a single phase of the cell cycle, it is not surprising that adding text diminishes the phase specificity of the clusters. However, it is not necessarily biologically more relevant to focus on phase specificity (and thus purely on the data). If one is really interested in obtaining phase-specific clusters rather than functionally coherent clusters, the results would only be improved by extending the vocabulary with terms and es-pecially phrases that are very specific to the different phases of the cell cycle by making a clear distinction between e.g., spindle pole body formation and spindle duplication. In GO these concepts are registered as  X  X pindle assembly X  and  X  X pin-dle pole body duplication X  and unless they are reported as such in literature, only the constituting keywords are rec-ognized in the text. An improved detection of multi-word terms (or phrases) could address this problem partially. Some new interesting clusters are found by the integrated clustering, such as e.g., cluster 2 (see Figure 12), which is enriched in Cbf1p, Met31-32p, Gcn4 and Pho4 motifs, all implicated in amino acid biosynthesis. This cluster was also found in Tavazoie et al. [42] and Spellman et al. [39] and not in the data clustering. Mixing data with literature does not have an effect on all clusters since, for instance, clus-ter 10 of the data clustering corresponds completely with cluster 11 of the integrated clustering (results not shown in Figure 12: Expression profiles of selected clusters from data and integrated representation We have demonstrated in our controlled experiment how fus-ing data changes the clustering results such that expression, text and motif profiles remain biologically relevant. The choice to validate results in motif space was driven by the motivation to use data that was independent enough to draw justified conclusions. We emphasize that the motif frame-work addresses direct regulation of gene expression through given transcription factors that bind on the motifs, and does not aim at a full reconstruction of genetic networks. In re-sponse to the overhead involved in checking many clustering solutions on the presence of significant motifs, we developed an intuitive heuristic that provides a rough one-shot quan-tification of biological significance. It proved a useful tool when having to economize on time-intensive biological evalu-ations, typically requiring expert assistance or extensive con-sultations of external databases. We additionally mention that, although perhaps a more straightforward choice (see e.g., Gibbons et al. [14] for a GO-based clustering score), we did not use GO in our validation framework as it lies at the basis of the domain vocabulary that acts as a perspec-tive to the literature. Moreover, as information from GO is partly built on information embedded in MEDLINE ab-stracts, we might have ended up in circular confirmations of truth. As multiple sources will be increasingly considered si-multaneously, exploring correlations between  X  X ummarizing X  scores based on expression, GO [14], literature (Section 3; [18][33]), pathways [49] or sequence [45] will be of increasing importance.
 Finally, we observed that fusing heterogeneous distance ma-trices requires caution in terms of scaling problems. We cir-cumvented this issue by transforming distances to p -values allowing a statistically more principled integration of text and data. However, it has not escaped our attention that distance matrices can alternatively be regarded as linear kernels and could thus be generalized to nonlinear cases. Rather than combining kernels as proposed, other exten-sions such as Canonical Correlations Analysis (CCA) as in Yamanishi et al. [46] could be envisioned. We conclude that although a joint analysis of heterogeneous data  X  ex-emplified in this paper with expression data and text-based information  X  poses several thresholds to successful experi-mentation, it has rewarding effects when trying to overcome the uncertain nature of large-scale genomic data.
