 Recommender Systems (RS) help online customers in iden-tifying those items from a variety of choices that best match their presumed needs and preferences. In this context ex-planations summarize the reasons why a specific item is pro-posed and are capable of increasing the users X  trust in the system X  X  results. This paper presents results from an online experiment on a real-world platform indicating that expla-nations are an essential piece of functionality of a recommen-dation system, that significantly increases users X  perception of the utility of a recommender system, the intention to use it repeatedly as well as the commitment to recommend it to others.
 H.5.m [ INFORMATION INTERFACES AND PRE-SENTATION ]: Miscellaneous Knowledge-based recommendation, Explanations
Recommendation systems support users in managing the information overload in virtual spaces by ranking and fil-tering items [6, 10]. Explanations provide users additional information about the recommendations themselves with the intent of pursuing specific objectives [3]. According to Tintarev and Masthoff [12] these explanation objectives can be mani-fold such as increasing a system X  X  trustworthiness, leveraging users X  confidence in decision making or being persuasive [14].
Since one of the earliest studies [5] on users X  preferences for explanations of recommendations considerable interest on this topic has been stirred as for instance summarized in [3]. The purpose of this study is to research and quantify the impact of the explanation feature on the users X  overall appreciation of the recommendation system itself. Notably it was of interest if users perceive a recommendation system differently if it provides explanations compared to no expla-nations on the result page. In short, we hypothesized that explaining recommendations makes a significant difference in users X  perception of the utility of a recommendation sys-tem and that it has a positive impact on users X  interaction experience, their intention to use the system more often and to recommend it to others.

The object of study was a real tourism recommender sys-tem that generated knowledgeable explanations, i.e. expla-nations that provide natural language arguments that me-diate between user characteristics (or the user model) and item properties. For instance the system could state:  X  X e think you will enjoy this resort with your family due to the available childcare facilities and the very moderate prices X  due to knowledge about the user (family) the item (child-care available, moderate cost level) and some additional do-main knowledge (families with children typically have more stringent budget restrictions than for instance double income couples). More details on the mechanism for generating rec-ommendations can be found in [15].

Next we will explain the applied evaluation methodology, detail our research hypotheses and results and finally con-clude with a discussion.
As the purpose of this evaluation is the confirmation of a causal relationship between the provision of knowledge-able explanations and the users X  perception of the system, a between users online experiment design was instrumented. The test was conducted on a real-world platform that is Central Europe X  X  most comprehensive information platform about spa resorts 1 that offers its users detailed information and multiple options for searching, browsing and comparing different offers. All users accessing the platform are ran-domly assigned into group A (no explanations) or group B (knowledgeable explanations) which was automatically mea-sured by a binary variable denoted explanation . Over 200 users participated in the experiment and participation was promoted by a banner on the platform that invited users to participate. Students had been encouraged by email to visit the platform, use the RS and participate in the sur-vey. Participants can win prizes of a total worth of several hundred Euros in vouchers for those spa resorts that users nominated as their favorites in the questionnaire. We lim-ited our analysis to those participants who had really used the recommender system before completing the survey, thus

 The platform includes the conversational recommender Aquarius that asks users about their preferences and re-trieves those spas from a catalogue that matches these re-quirements according to their descriptions and a knowledge base that mediates between preferences and item descrip-tions. Recommendations are ranked according to a match-ing degree from an interval 1 to 100% that indicates the share of weighted preferences that are fulfilled by a specific recommendation. In addition, users who have been assigned to group B will also receive knowledgeable explanations on the result page (see Figure 1) while users in group A receive no explanations at all. However, results and their rankings have been the same in both groups in case of equal user input to the conversational RS. The task of users partici-pating in the experiment was to identify their favorite spa resorts by interacting with the recommender. Then they completed a post-treatment survey that measured different constructs such as users X  perception of the system X  X  useful-ness and its ease of use as being the main determinants of the usage intention according to the technology acceptance model (TAM) [2]. Furthermore, the users X  trust in the rec-ommender system as well as their intention to use it re-peatedly, positive usage experience and their willingness to recommend it to others were measured comparable to the technology acceptance study for recommender websites in tourism by Bauernfeind and Zins [16]. Furthermore, exoge-nous factors like internet familiarity, web technology expe-rience, experience in visiting thermal spas and frequency of visiting spas, demography (education, gender and age) as well as how they became aware of this survey (invitation by mail, banner on the website) were controlled. None of these variables varied significantly with respect to the explanation variable.

In detail, the measured constructs and their associated variables 2 are enlisted in Table 1. Eight variables measure the construct usefulness as it is perceived by the user, i.e. the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance [2]. The items are based on the scale developed by Davis who showed that the perceived usefulness highly correlates with the ac-tual usage of the system.

The construct Perceived ease of use measures the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort [2]. For that purpose we used two items from Brooke X  X  system usability scale (SUS) for quick usability evaluations in industry [1]. For both constructs, Cronbach X  X  alpha was over 0 : 90 indicating a high reliability of the items measuring the construct.

The third measured construct is Trust in the RS that should measure how the users perceive security aspects of the RS with respect to the information presented (variable Trust information ) and the processing of the information ac-quired from the user (variable Trust data use ). Although, both items have already been used in the context of TAM by [16], they turned out to be not very reliable items here (Cronbach X  X  alpha = 0.41). The reason will be explicated in the context of the dimensionality reduction using princi-pal component analysis, where it becomes obvious that the variable Trust information also strongly loads on the fac-tor representing the perceived usefulness of the system that presents  X  X nformation that can be trusted X . Furthermore, we asked users about their Experience and Commitment where
S ome of the measurement items have already been em-ployed in earlier work [7]. a positive user experience, the intention to repeatedly use the RS as well as the commitment to recommend it to oth-ers is measured. Answers to variables 1-15 are encoded on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from I strongly disagree (1) , I disagree (2) , I neither agree nor disagree (3) , I agree (4) to I strongly agree (5) . In Figure 2 we depict our hypotheses that we want to confirm. Ellipses represent single variables while rectangles represent constructs. In short, we hypothesize that the explanation feature increases perceived usefulness (H1) and trust (H3) in the recommendation system, while the usability of the system (H2) should not be affected by explanations on the result page. Perceived usefulness (H4), ease of use (H5) and trust (H6) should positively correlate with usage experience as well as intention to repeated use and recommend to others. Next, we will validate the hy-potheses and present detailed results.
In a first step, we applied factor analysis on variables 1 to 12 to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to assess the factorial validity of constructs in Table 1 using principal component extraction. The resulting three factors (F1 to F3) correspond well to the constructs perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PeoU) and trust as depicted in Figure 2.

As can be seen from Table 2 Factor 1 is very consistent with the items 1-8 of construct perceived usefulness and ex-plains 43.5% of total variance. Factor 2 is also highly cor-related with items 9 and 10 thus representing the construct perceived ease of use and additional 12.5% of variance. The third factor is loaded by variables 11 and 12, however 11 is also highly correlated with Factor 1, as question 11 can also be interpreted to support PU. In total, all three factors extracted 64.5% of the total variance.

Next, we apply oneway ANOVA in order to evaluate the impact of the knowledgeable explanations on these three fac-tors as summarized in Table 3. Based on the F-statistics it becomes obvious that only Factor 1 representing the per-ceived usefulness of the recommendation system is signifi-cantly impacted by the provision of knowledgeable explana-tions ( F 1 ; 118 = 11 : 443, p = : 001). Neither the perceived ease of use nor the factor trust vary significantly ( &lt; 5%). The strength of the impact of providing knowledgeable explana-tions on the result page of the RS on the factor representing the construct perceived usefulness is a moderate one. It fraction of variance between both groups from total vari-ance. Thus hypotheses H1 and H2 can be confirmed. H3 is not confirmed.

Furthermore, the impact of the three factors on the users X  experience and commitment is measured by giving the Pear-son correlation coefficient. As can be seen from Table 4 Fac-tor 1 representing the perceived usefulness strongly corre-lates with the variables on positive experience as well as com-mitment to recommend the system to others and to use it repeatedly (accept hypothesis H4) and thus replicates many of the earlier findings on the acceptance of information tech-nology [13]. However, hypothesis H5 has to be rejected as Factor 2 (PeoU) does not show a significant positive corre-lation with any of the three variables. Finally, H6 has to be accepted, although the correlation between Factor 3 consti-tuting the construct trust is rather low. In the next section we will discuss these findings in more detail.
The main result of this study is that knowledgeable ex-planations significantly increase the perceived usefulness of a recommender system (H1). This has been shown by an online experiment on a real-world platform involving anony-mous users of this website, while up to now almost all eval-uation studies about explanations for recommender systems have been conducted on specific research platforms [5] or prototypes [11]. Although explanations on the result page constitute only one of the many technical features and as-pects of a recommender system it is an important result that explanations still have a significant impact on the system X  X  perceived usefulness. Furthermore, the study showed that the system X  X  explanation facility is not perceived to make the use of a recommendation system easier (H2). However, if the evaluated system would offer its users tradeoff analysis and critiquing-based navigation functionality like done by [9] then PeoU could be impacted. [16] identified the construct Trust to be a strong influential factor that highly correlates with satisfaction and commitment with recommender web-sites. However, according to the rejected hypothesis H3 the trust in a recommender system itself -in contrast to a rec-ommender website like Expedia or Active Buyers Guide eval-uated in [16] -is not impacted by the explanation variable.
Furthermore, the perceived usefulness and thus indirectly also the knowledgeable explanations positively impact the users X  experience in using the recommendation systems as well as their commitment to repeatedly use it and recom-mend it to others. This strong interaction between the fac-tor PU and the experience and commitment variables has been shown by strong and highly significant correlation co-efficients (H4). Although the perceived ease of use of infor-mation technology traditionally influences its adoption rate [13] it is one of the findings in this study that a correlation between factor PeoU and the experience and commitment variables cannot be confirmed, i.e. H5 was rejected. One of the reasons for this could be that recommender systems are focusing on easing information access and are therefore unanimously perceived as very easy to use. This can be substantiated by the observation that the empirical mean of both  X  X ase of use X  variables (i.e. numbers 9 and 10 in Table 1) was &gt; 4 : 4 and thus the highest among all 15 measured vari-ables on a 5-point Likert scale. Furthermore, hypothesis H6 was only weakly confirmed and the construct trust has only a low correlation with the experience and commitment vari-ables. This contrasts the findings in [16], where trust puts the highest loadings on website satisfaction in their struc-tural model. However, the difference can be explained by the fact that [16] researched recommender websites in gen-eral and not in particular recommender systems as a tool. Therefore, Bauernfeind and Zins X  study actually researches online experiences with websites in general where trust is an important prerequisite for satisfaction and commitment as also discussed for instance by [4]. However, when focusing specifically on recommender systems as a tool for search and retrieval as done in this study then trust is less important because users do not use it in order to conduct commercial transactions in a narrow sense with it.
This paper neglects accuracy aspects of recommendation systems but evaluated further information systems objec-tives such as usefulness and trust as postulated by [8]. The findings show that the explanation feature can significantly increase a recommender system X  X  perceived usefulness and thus contributes to increase users X  repeated usage intention and their commitment to recommend the service. 3 [1] J.
