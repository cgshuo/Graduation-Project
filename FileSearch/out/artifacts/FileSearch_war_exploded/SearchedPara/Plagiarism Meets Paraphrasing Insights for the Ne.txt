In this article, we analyze the relationship between paraphrasing and plagiarism, paying special attention to which paraphrase phenomena underlie acts of plagiarism and which of them are detected by plagiarism detection systems. With this aim in mind, we created the P4P corpus, a new resource that uses a paraphrase typology to annotate a subset of the PAN-PC-10 corpus for automatic plagiarism detection. The results of the Second International Competition on Plagiarism Detection were analyzed in the light of this annotation.
 density of paraphrase mechanisms make plagiarism detection more difficult, (ii) lexical substi-tutions are the paraphrase mechanisms used the most when plagiarizing, and (iii) paraphrase mechanisms tend to shorten the plagiarized text. For the first time, the paraphrase mechanisms behind plagiarism have been analyzed, providing critical insights for the improvement of auto-matic plagiarism detection systems. 1. Introduction without explicitly acknowledging the original author and source (IEEE 2008). Although plagiarism may occur incidentally, it is often the outcome of a conscious process. Inde-pendently from the vocabulary or channel through which an idea is communicated, a person who fails to provide its corresponding source is suspected of plagiarism. The amount of text available in electronic media nowadays has caused cases of plagiarism to increase. In the academic domain, some surveys estimate that around 30% of student reports include plagiarism (Association of Teachers and Lecturers 2008), and a more recent study increases this percentage to more than 40% (Comas et al. 2010). As a result, its manual detection has become infeasible. Models for automatic plagiarism detection are being developed as a countermeasure. Their main objective is assisting people in the task of detecting plagiarism X  X s a side effect, plagiarism is discouraged.
 design of these systems, which we consider to be a key issue for their improvement.
Martin (2004) identifies different kinds of plagiarism: of ideas, of references, of author-ship, word by word, and paraphrase plagiarism. In the first case, ideas, knowledge, or theories from another person are claimed without proper citation. In plagiarism of references and authorship, citations and entire documents are included without any mention of their authors. Word by word plagiarism, also known as copy X  X aste the plagiarized document. Regarding paraphrase plagiarism, in order to conceal the plagiarism act, a different form expressing the same content is often used. Paraphras-ing, generally understood as sameness of meaning between different wordings, is the linguistic mechanism underlying many plagiarism acts and the linguistic process on which plagiarism is based.
 tionship in automatic plagiarism detection is set out. We aim not only to investigate how difficult detecting paraphrase cases for state-of-the-art plagiarism detectors is, but to understand which types of paraphrases underlie plagiarism acts and which are the most difficult to detect.

Section 6 draws some conclusions and offers insights for future research. 918 2. Paraphrase Typology nomenon, identify its different manifestations, and, in short, go into its characterization in depth. Also, typologies constitute the basis of many corpus annotation processes, which have their own effects on the typologies themselves: The annotation process identification of new types and the revision of the existing ones. Moreover, an annotated corpus following a typology is a powerful resource for the development and evaluation of computational linguistics systems. In this section, after setting out a brief state of the art on paraphrase typologies and the weaknesses they present, the typology used for the annotation of the P4P corpus is described.
 analysis, linguistics, and computational linguistics, which has originated typologies paraphrases according to the reformulation mechanisms or communicative intention behind them (G  X  ulich 2003; Cheung 2009), but without focusing on the linguistic
From the perspective of linguistic analysis, some typologies are strongly tied to concrete theoretical frameworks, as the case of Meaning X  X ext Theory (Mel X   X  cuk 1992; can be considered indirect approaches to paraphrasing in the sense that they deal with equivalent expressions (Chomsky 1957; Harris 1957; Levin 1993). They do not cover paraphrasing as a whole, however, but focus on lexical and syntactic phenomena. Other typologies come from linguistics-related fields like editing (Faigley paraphrasing.
 useful for a specific system or application, or the most common types found in a corpus.
They are specific-work oriented and far from being comprehensive: Barzilay, McKeown, and Elhadad (1999), Dorr et al. (2004), and Dutrey et al. (2011), among others. Other types (Barzilay 2003; Shimohata 2004); these classifications do not reach the category of typologies sensu stricto. Finally, there are more comprehensive typologies, such as the ones by Dras (1999), Fujita (2005), and Bhagat (2009). They usually take the shape of very fine-grained lists of paraphrase types grouped into bigger classes following different criteria. They generally focus on these lists of specific paraphrase mechanisms, which will always be endless.
 upgraded version of the one presented in the latter. Our paraphrase concept is based on the idea that paraphrases should have the same or an equivalent propositional content, that is, the same core meaning. This conception opens the door to para-phrases sometimes disregarded in the literature, mainly focused on lexical and syntactic mechanisms.
 of paraphrasing, rather than presenting a long, fine-grained, and inevitably incom-sive of paraphrasing as a whole: It was contrasted with, and sometimes inspired by, state-of-the-art paraphrase typologies to cover the phenomena described in them; it was used to annotate (i) the plagiarism paraphrases in the P4P corpus (cf. Section 3), (ii) 3,900 paraphrases from the news domain in the Microsoft Research Paraphrase corpus (MSRP) (Dolan and Brockett 2005), 3 and (iii) 1,000 relational paraphrases (i.e., paraphrases expressing a relation between two entities) extracted from the Wikipedia-based Relational Paraphrase Acquisition corpus (WRPA) (Vila, Rodr  X   X guez, and Mart  X   X  Submitted). 4 P4P and MSRP are English corpora, whereas WRPA is a Spanish one.
The success in the annotation of such diverse corpora with our paraphrase typology guarantees its adequacy for general paraphrasing not only in English.
 20 paraphrase types grouped in four classes and four subclasses. Paraphrase types stand for the linguistic mechanism triggering the paraphrase phenomenon. They are 920 grouped in classes according to the nature of such trigger linguistic mechanism: (i) those types where the paraphrase phenomenon arises at the morpholexicon level, (ii) those at the semantic level. Classes inform about the origin of the paraphrase phenomenon, but such paraphrase phenomenon can involve changes in other parts of the sentence.
For instance, a morpholexicon-based change (derivational) like the one in Example (1), where the nominal form failure is exchanged for the verb failed , has obvious syntactic implications; the paraphrase phenomenon, however, is triggered by the morpholexical change. 5 A structure-based change (diathesis) like the one in Example (2) involves an inflectional change in heard/hear among others, but the trigger change is syntactic.
Finally, paraphrases in semantics are based on a different distribution of semantic
Example (3). Miscellaneous changes comprise types not directly related to one single class. Finally, the subclasses follow the classical organization in formal linguistic levels from morphology to discourse and simply establish an intermediate grouping between some classes and their types. (1) a. the comical failure of the head master X  X  attempt at a  X  X arents X  Committee X  (2) a. the report of a gun on shore was still heard at intervals (3) a. I X  X e got a hunch that we  X  X e not through with that game yet
Although the types in our typology are presented in isolation, they can be combined: in Example (4), changes of order of the subject (  X  ) and the adverb (  X  ), and two same-polarity substitutions ( said/answered [  X  ]and cautiously/carefully [  X  ]) can be observed. A difference between cases such as Example (4) and, for example, Example (1) should one single paraphrase phenomenon is considered; in Example (4), same-polarity substi-tutions and changes of order are independent and can take place in isolation, so four paraphrase phenomena are considered. (4) a.  X  X es, X  [said]  X  [I]  X  [cautiously]  X  In what follows, types in our typology are briefly described.

Inflectional changes consist of changing inflectional affixes of words. In Example (5), a plural/singular alternation ( streets/street ) can be observed. (5) a. it was with difficulty that the course of streets could be followed
Modal verb changes are changes of modality using modal verbs, like might and could in Example (6). (6) a. I [...] was still lost in conjectures who they might be
Derivational changes consist of changes of category with or without using derivational affixes. These changes imply a syntactic change in the sentence in which they occur.
In Example (7), the verbal form differing is changed to the adjective different ,withthe consequent structural reorganization. (7) a. I have heard many accounts of him [ ...] all differing from each other
Spelling and format changes comprise changes in the spelling and format of lexical (or functional) units, such as case changes, abbreviations, or digit/letter alternations.
In Example (8), case changes occur ( Peace/PEACE ). (8) a. And yet they are calling for Peace ! X  Peace !!
Same-polarity substitutions change one lexical (or functional) unit for another with approximately the same meaning. 6 Among the linguistic mechanisms of this type, we find synonymy, general/specific substitutions, or exact/approximate alternations.
In Example (9), very little is more general than a teaspoonful of . (9) a. a teaspoonful of vanilla
Synthetic/analytic substitutions consist of changing synthetic structures for analytic structures, and vice versa. This type comprises mechanisms such as compounding/ decomposition, light element, or lexically emptied specifier additions/deletions, or alternations affecting genitives and possessives. In Example (10b), a (lexically emptied) specifier ( a sequence of ) has been deleted: it did not add new content to the lexical unit, but emphasized its plural nature. (10) a. A sequence of ideas Opposite-polarity substitutions . Two phenomena are considered within this type. for its antonym or complementary and another change of polarity has to occur within the same sentence in order to maintain the same meaning. In Example (11), failed is substituted for its antonym succeed and a negation is added. Second, there is the case 922 antonym in comparative structures. Here an inversion of the compared elements has to occur. In Example (12), the adjectival phrases far deeper and more general change to the opposite-polarity ones less serious and less common . To maintain the same meaning, the order of the compared elements (i.e., what the Church considers and what is perceived by the population) has to be inverted. (11) a. Leicester [...] failed in both enterprises (12) a. the sense of scandal given by this is far deeper and more general than the Converse substitutions take place when a lexical unit is changed for its converse pair.
In order to maintain the same meaning, an argument inversion has to occur. In Exam-ple (13), awarded to is changed to receiving [ ...] from , and the arguments the Geological
Society in London and him are inverted. (13) a. the Geological Society of London in 1855 awarded to him the Wollaston
Diathesis alternation type gathers those diathesis alternations in which verbs can participate, such as the active/passive alternation (Example (14)). (14) a. the guide drew our attention to a gloomy little dungeon Negation switching consists of changing the position of the negation within a sentence.
In Example (15), no changes to does not . (15) a. In order to move us, it needs no reference to any recognized original
Ellipsis includes linguistic ellipsis (i.e, those cases in which the elided fragments can be recovered through linguistic mechanisms). In Example (16b), the subject he appears in both clauses; in Example (16a), it is only displayed in the first one. (16) a. In the scenes with Iago he equaled Salvini, yet did not in any one point
Coordination changes consist of changes in which one of the members of the pair contains coordinated linguistic units, and this coordination is not present or changes its position and/or form in the other member of the pair. The juxtaposed sentences with a full stop in Example (17a) are coordinated with the conjunction and in (17b). (17) a. It is estimated that he spent nearly  X 10,000 on these works. In addition he
Subordination and nesting changes consist of changes in which one of the members of the pair contains a subordination or nested element, which is not present, or changes its position and/or form within the other member of the pair. What is a relative clause in Example (18a) ( which limits the percentage of Jewish pupils in any school )ispartofthe main clause in Example (18b). (18) a. the Russian law, which limits the percentage of Jewish pupils in any school,
Punctuation and format changes consist of any change in the punctuation or format of a sentence (not of a lexical unit, cf. lexicon-based changes). In Example (19a), the list appears numbered and, in Example (19b), it does not. (19) a. At Victoria Station you will purchase (1) a return ticket to Streatham Com-and vice versa. The direct style can be seen in Example (20a) and the indirect in Example (20b). (20) a.  X  X he is mine, X  said the Great Spirit
Sentence modality changes are those cases in which there is a change of modality (not provoked by modal verbs, cf. modal verb changes), but the illocutive value is main-tained. In Example (21a), interrogative sentences can be observed; they are changed to an affirmative sentence in Example (21b). (21) a. The real question is, will it pay? will it please Theophilus P. Polk or vex
Syntax/discourse structure changes gather a wide variety of syntax/discourse reorga-nizations not covered by the types in the syntax and discourse subclasses above. An example can be seen in Example (22). (22) a. How he would stare! 924
Semantics-based changes are those that involve a different lexicalization of the same content units. 8 These changes affect more than one lexical unit and a clear-cut division of these units in the mapping between the two members of the paraphrase pair is not possible. In Example (23), the content units TROPICAL -LIKE ASPECT tropical/tropical appearance )and INCREASE OF THIS ASPECT both fragments, but there is not a clear-cut mapping between the two. (23) a. The scenery was altogether more tropical
Change of order includes any type of change of order from the word level to the sentence level. In Example (24), first changes its position in the sentence. (24) a. First we came to the tall palm trees
Addition/deletion This type consists of all additions/deletions of lexical and functional units. In Example (25b), one day is deleted. (25) a. One day she took a hot flat-iron, removed my clothes, and held it on my 3. Building the P4P Corpus
This section describes how P4P, a new paraphrase corpus with paraphrase type annota-tion, was built. 9 First, we will set out a brief state of the art on paraphrase corpora.
MSRP corpus (Dolan and Brockett 2005), which contains 5,801 English sentence pairs from news articles hand-labeled with a binary judgment indicating whether human raters considered them to be paraphrases (67%) or not (33%). Cohn, Callison-Burch, at word or phrase level. 10 The pairs were compiled from three different types of corpora: (i) sentence pairs judged equivalent from the MSRP corpus, (ii) the Multiple-
Translation Chinese corpus, and (iii) the monolingual parallel corpus used by Barzilay and McKeown (2001). The WRPA corpus (Vila, Rodr  X   X guez, and Mart  X   X  Submitted) is a corpus of relational paraphrases extracted from Wikipedia. It comprises paraphrases expressing relations like person X  X ate of birth in English and author X  X ork in Spanish. Moreover, Max and Wisniewski (2010) built the Wikipedia Correction and Paraphrase
Corpus from the Wikipedia revision history. 11 Apart from paraphrases, the corpus authors set out a typology of these revisions and classify them as meaning-preserving or meaning-altering. There also exist works where the focus is not to build a paraphrase corpus, but to create a paraphrase extraction or generation system, which ends up in also building a paraphrase collection, such as Barzilay and Lee (2003).

Burrows, Potthast, and Stein (2012) built the Webis Crowd Paraphrase Corpus by crowd-sourcing more than 4,000 manually simulated samples of paraphrase plagia-rism. 12 In order to create feasible mechanisms for crowd-sourcing paraphrase acqui-sition, they built a classifier to reject bad instances of paraphrase plagiarism (e.g., cases of verbatim plagiarism). These crowd-sourced instances are similar to the cases of simulated plagiarism in the PAN-PC-10 corpus, and hence the P4P (see the following).
Plagiarism Detection. 13 The PAN competition appeared with the aim of creating the first large-scale evaluation framework for plagiarism detection. It relies on two main resources: a corpus with cases of plagiarism and a set of evaluation measures specially suited to the problem of automatic plagiarism detection (cf. Section 4) (Potthast et al. 2010). We focus on the Pan-10 plagiarism detection competition. The corpus used in this edition, known as PAN-PC-10, was composed of a set of suspicious documents
D that may or may not contain plagiarized fragments, together with a set of potential source documents D . In order to build it, text fragments were extracted randomly from documents d  X  D and inserted into some d q  X  D q . The PAN-PC-10 contains circa 70,000 cases of plagiarism; 40% of them are exact copies, and the rest involved some kind of obfuscation (paraphrasing). Most of the obfuscated cases were generated artificially, that is, rewriting operations were imitated by a computational process. were created by humans who aimed at simulating paraphrase cases of plagiarism.
These cases were generated through Amazon Mechanical Turk, with clear instructions et al. (2010), most of the turkers had attended college and 62% identified themselves as native English speakers. 15 Cases in this subset of the corpus are referred to onwards as simulated plagiarism. 16 ( plg sim ). They consist of pairs of source and plagiarized fragments, where the latter was manually created reformulating the former. From this set, we selected those cases containing 50 words or less ( | plg sim | X  50); 847 paraphrase pairs met these conditions and were selected as our working subset. The decision was taken for the sake of simplicity and efficiency, and is backed by state-of-the-art paraphrases corpora. As a way of illustration, the MSRP contains 28 words per case on average and the Barzilay and Lee (2003) collection includes examples of about 20 words in length only.
The tagset and the scope . After tokenization of the working corpus, the annotation was performed by, on the one hand, tagging the paraphrase phenomena present in 926 each source/plagiarism pair with our tagset (each pair contains multiple paraphrase range of the fragment affected by each paraphrase phenomenon).
 exact copies; non-paraphrase refers to fragments in the source/target pairs that are not semantically related. The reason for adding these two tags is to see how they perform in comparison to the actual paraphrase cases.
 tween the fragments brotherhood among and other brothers with , the paraphrase mapping nominal phrases and prepositions. They consist of two same-polarity substitutions. (26) a. [ the brotherhood ]  X  [ among ]  X  whom they had dwelt
It is important to note that paraphrase tags can overlap. In Example (27), a same-polarity substitution overlaps a change of order in sagely/wisely . Tags can also be discontinuous, such as in Example (28a): distinct [...] from .Thepair distinct [...] from and unconnected to are a same-polarity substitution. (27) a. sagely shaking his head (28) a. But yet I imagine that the application of the term  X  X othic X  may be found to The scope affects the annotation task differently regarding the classes:
Morpholexicon-based changes, semantics-based changes, and miscellaneous changes : only the linguistic unit(s) affected by the trigger change is (are) tagged. As some of these changes entail other changes, two different attributes are provided: those cases in which the trigger change does not entail any other change in the sentence; and GLOBAL , which stands for those cases in which the trigger change does entail other changes in the sentence. In Example (29), an isolated same-polarity substitution takes place, so the scope older/aging is annotated and the attribute
Example (30), the same-polarity substitution entails changes in the punctuation. In that case, only but/however is annotated using the attribute GLOBAL indicated by the GLOBAL attribute, neither the type of change nor the fragment suffering the change are specified in the annotation. This distinction between called  X  X rojection X  in our tag system. (29) a. The older trees (30) a. would not have had to endure; but she does not seem embittered reorganization is tagged. Moreover, most structure-based changes have a key element tences in Example (31a) and two coordinated clauses in Example (31b), so all of them constitute the scope of the phenomenon. The conjunction and stands for the key element. (31) a. They were born of the same universal fact. They are of the same Father!
In the case of identical and non-paraphrases, no LOCAL elements are used, and only the affected fragment is tagged.

The annotation process. The annotation process was carried out by three postgraduate linguists experienced in annotation and having an advanced English level. Among the annotators, there was one of the authors of the typology (annotator two were not familiar with the typology before the annotation (annotators
This mixed group allowed for sharing experienced and blind knowledge regarding the typology, both necessary for the test of the paraphrasing types when applied to the P4P corpus.
 in three phases: annotators X  training, inter-annotator agreement, and final annotation. In the annotators X  training phase, 50 cases were doubly annotated by the supervision of A , following a preliminary version of the guidelines. Problems and disagreements were discussed. Following this discussion, some changes were made to the guidelines (see footnote 9), and the 50 annotations by one of the annotators revised to be included in the corpus. In the inter-annotator agreement phase, 100 cases were doubly annotated by B and C and the inter-annotator agreement computed. In the final annotation phase, we annotated the remaining cases in P4P; the examples were annotated only once by A , B ,or C .
 tion) were randomly selected. Once the annotation process finished, we calculated the similarity between the distributions of paraphrase types in the inter-annotator subset and the rest of the corpus. We used the well-known cosine measure, ranged in [0, 1] with 1 implying maximum similarity. The similarity was 0.988.
 are not suitable for our work, because agreement by chance is almost impossible, due to the fact that we do not only annotate types but also scope: The amount of possible scope combinations in each pair is in the order of 2 | src number of tokens in the source or plagiarized fragment. As an alternative, we developed a measure for inter-annotator agreement in paraphrase type annotation ranged in [0, 1].
For each paraphrase phenomenon, we calculate the degree of overlapping between the two annotations at token level, considering types and scope.
 B and C be the set of paraphrase phenomena annotated by 928 independently all the phenomena occurring over all the plagiarism X  X ource pairs). We define the inter-annotator agreement between B and C as: where s and p refer to the source and plagiarized tokens in the annotation, re-spectively;  X  = 1 for phenomena of the type addition/deletion and  X  = 0 . 5 for others (in the case of addition/deletion only one text fragment, either in the source or plagia-rized text, exists). As expected, an overlapping between b and c exists only if the two phenomena are annotated with the same paraphrase type (otherwise, the overlapping is 0).
 may be understood as a regression precision taking the annotation by a regression recall taking the annotations by B as reference. K
Thus, F 1 obtains the same value independently of what we could take as a reference annotation.
 task (the binary decision of whether two sentences are paraphrases in the MSRP corpus), a similar agreement was obtained (Dolan and Brockett 2005); hence we consider this as an acceptable result. These results show the suitability of our paraphrase typology for the annotation of plagiarism examples.

Annotation results. Paraphrase type frequencies and total and average lengths are collected in Tables 1 and 2. Same-polarity substitutions represent the most frequent paraphrase type ( freq rel = 0 . 46). At a considerable distance, the second most frequent were collected has a major impact on these results. They were created manually, asking people to simulate plagiarizing by re-writing a collection of text fragments X  X hat is, they were originated in a reformulation framework, where a conscious reformulative inten-tion by a speaker exists. Our hypothesis is that the most frequent paraphrase types in the
P4P corpus correspond to the paraphrase mechanisms most accessible to humans when asked to reformulate or plagiarize. Same-polarity substitutions and addition/deletion are mechanisms that are relatively simple to apply to a text by humans: changing one lexical unit for its synonym (understanding synonymy in a general sense) and deleting a text fragment, respectively.
 ments are shorter than in the source. As a result, the entire plagiarized fragments tend to be shorter than their source (cf. top of Table 2). This means that, while reformulating (plagiarizing), people tend to use shorter expressions for the same meaning, or, as already said, just delete some fragments. Finally, the paraphrase types with the largest average length are in syntax-and discourse-based change classes. The reason is to be found in the distinction between the two ways to annotate the scope: in structural reorganizations, we annotate the whole linguistic unit suffering the change. in the PAN corpora are. In order to check this, two small collections of cases of real text re-use, RWP (Real Web Plagiarism) and sub-METER, were annotated with our typology. RWP is composed of actual cases of plagiarism reported on-line and sub-METER includes a set of re-used sentences extracted from the METER (MEasuring TExt
Re-use) corpus, which contains cases of journalistic text re-use (Clough, Gaizauskas, 930 and Piao 2002). 18 Around 150 cases of re-use were annotated with our typology. As in the P4P corpus, the most frequent paraphrase operations are: (a) same-polarity substitutions, with 27% (36%) in the METER (RWP) sample and (b) addition/deletion, with 29% (23%) in the METER (RWP) sample. The distributions of other paraphrase operations are also very similar to those in P4P (cf. Fig. 2). Regarding the lengths, the behavior is as observed already in the P4P corpus: The resulting re-used texts tend to exploited in cross-language plagiarism detection (Barr  X  on-Cede  X  no et al. 2010; Potthast et al. 2011), representing a promising factor to consider in the detection of paraphrase plagiarism. 4. Plagiarism Detection Approaches at Pan-10
In this section, we move to the analysis and evaluation of existing systems for plagia-on the Pan-10 competition. This information will be taken up in Section 5, where the performance of these systems when dealing with paraphrase plagiarism is analyzed by comparing it with the P4P data set.

Our analysis is focused on factor (ii): generally known as external plagiarism detection. 19 direct application in this case: In order to conceal the plagiarism act, a different form expressing the same content, that is, a paraphrase, is often used.

 the Pan-10 competition. 20 As observed by Potthast et al. (2010), most of the participants X  approaches to the external plagiarism detection task followed a three steps schema: (1) retrieval: for a suspicious document d q , the most closely related documents D retrieved; (2) detailed analysis: d q and d  X  D are compared section-wise in order to identify specific plagiarism X  X ource candidate fragment pairs; and (3) post-processing: bad candidates (very short or not similar enough) are discarded and neighbor text fragments are combined. For the sake of clarity, we consider the IR pre-processing techniques applied by some participants as a preliminary step (0). The pre-processing step gathers shallow linguistic processes and splitting of the source and suspicious documents in order to handle smaller text chunks. A summary of the parameters used account when investigating the correlation with paraphrase plagiarism detection (cf. Section 5.2).
 steps (1) and (2), whereas a few of them do not. 21 Most of the pre-processing opera-tions aim at minimizing the effect of paraphrasing, such as case-folding (spelling and format changes in our typology), n -gram ordering (change of order), and synonymic normalization (same-polarity substitutions).
 overlapping word 9-grams with at least one named entity in order to compose the queries. The rest of the participants make a comparison on the basis of word n -grams (with n = { 1, 3, 4, 5 } ) or character 16-grams. Some of them order the n -grams X  tokens Mart  X   X n Ramos 2010).

Brandejs (2010) and Rodr  X   X guez Torrej  X  on and Mart  X   X n Ramos (2010), as well as Gottron (2010), apply ordered n -grams. Corezola Pereira, Moreira, and Galante (2010) apply a classification system considering different features: bag-of-words cosine similarity, the similarity score assigned by an IR engine, and length deviation between the two fragments, among others. Alzahrani and Salim (2010) is the only team that, on the basis of WordNet synsets, expands the documents X  vocabulary. The best systems par-ticipating in the competition were those using word n -grams (Kasprzak and Brandejs 2010; Muhr et al. 2010) as well as character n -grams (dot X  X lot technique) (Grozea and
Popescu 2010b; Zou, Wei jiang Long, and Ling 2010) in either one or both of steps (1) and (2). 22 discarding a detected case if its length s q is lower than a previously estimated threshold discontinuous fragments if the distance  X  ( s 1 , s 2 ) between them is shorter than a given threshold (i.e., they are particularly close to each other). Probably the most interesting operation is merging. The maximum merging threshold is 5,000 characters (Costa-juss ` a et al. 2010).
 basis of recall and precision comes naturally. Nevertheless, plagiarism detection aims at retrieving specific (plagiarized X  X ource) fragments rather than documents. Given a suspicious document d q and a collection of potential source documents D , the detector should retrieve: (a) a specific text fragment s q  X  and (b) a specific text fragment s  X  d , the claimed source for s work (Potthast et al. 2010). The plagiarized text fragments are treated as basic retrieval units, with s i  X  S defining a query for which a plagiarism detection algorithm returns 934 defined as: where computes the positionally overlapping characters. In both equations, S and R represent the entire set of actually plagiarized text fragments and detections, respectively.

Paraphrase plagiarism has been identified as an open issue in plagiarism detection (Potthast et al. 2010; Stein et al. 2011). In order to figure out the limitations of current plagiarism detectors when dealing with paraphrase plagiarism, we analyze their per-formance on the P4P corpus. Our aim is to understand what types of paraphrases make plagiarism more difficult to detect.
 to the paraphrase phenomena occurring within them. This grouping allows for the analysis of detectors X  performance in Section 5.2. In order to obtain a global picture, we first analyze the detectors considering the entire PAN-PC-10 corpus. The aim is to give a general perspective of how difficult detecting cases with a high paraphrase density is with respect to cases of verbatim copy and algorithmically simulated paraphrasing.
Then we analyze the detectors X  performance when considering the previously men-tioned groupings in the P4P corpus. We do so in order to identify those (combinations of) paraphrase operations that better allow a plagiarized text to go unnoticed. These analyses open the perspective to research directions in automatic plagiarism detection that aim at detecting these kinds of borrowing. 5.1 Clustering Similar Cases of Plagiarism in the P4P Corpus els of granularity: The scope of the paraphrase phenomenon goes from word to (multiple-)sentence level (cf. Section 3) and plagiarism detectors aim at detecting en-tire, in general, multiple-sentence fragments. We should bear in mind that plagiarism detectors do not try to detect a paraphrase instance, but a plagiarized fragment and its source, which may include multiple paraphrases. The detection of a paraphrase that it probably uncovered a broader text fragment, a case of plagiarism. As a result, directly comparing paraphrase annotation and detectors X  outcomes is not possible, and organizing the data in a way that makes them comparable is required. Thus, we grouped together cases of plagiarism with similar concentrations of paraphrases or in which a kind or paraphrase clearly stands out from the rest in order to observe how the detectors performed on different profiles of plagiarism. 23 As we only take into account the type and number of paraphrase phenomena in a pair, the scope does not have an impact on the results and the difference in granularity becomes irrelevant.
 clustering method. In brief, k -means performs as follows: (i) k , the number of clusters, is set up at the beginning, (ii) k points are selected as initial centroids of the corresponding centers and the members of each cluster are iteratively redefined to maximize the similarity among the members of a cluster (intra-cluster) and minimize the similarity among elements of different clusters (extra-cluster). 936 pair in the P4P. Each feature corresponds to one paraphrase tag in our annotation, and its weight is the relative frequency of the type in the pair. Because same-polarity more than 45% of the paraphrase operations in the P4P corpus and 96% of the plagiarism cases include them), however, they do not represent a good discriminat-ing factor. This was confirmed by a preliminary experiment carried out considering different values for k . Therefore, k -means was applied by considering 21 features only.
 considering k = [2, 3, ... 20]. Our aim was twofold: (i) to obtain the best possible clusters for every value of k and (ii) to determine the number of clusters to better organize the cases. In order to determine a convenient value for k , we applied the elbow method (cf. Ketchen and Shook 1996), which calculates the clusters X  distortion evolution (also elbow, X  was in k = 6.

A summary is included in Figure 4. Although same-polarity substitutions are not taken into account in the clustering, they obviously remain in the source X  X lagiarism pairs and their numbers are displayed. They are similarly distributed among all the obtained clusters and are the most frequent in all of them. Next, we describe the obtained results paraphrase cases of plagiarism.
 considered as the extremes of the paraphrase continuum: absolute identicality and a deep change in the form, respectively. In c 5 and c the most frequent (after same-polarity substitutions), respectively, and more frequent than in the other clusters. 24 Moreover, the most common type in c format. We observed that 39.36% of the cases in spelling and format involve only case
In the other clusters, no relevant features are observed. In terms of quantitative com-plexity, we consider the amount of paraphrase phenomena occurring in the source X  plagiarism pairs. It follows that c 5 contains the cases with the least phenomena on average. The remaining clusters have a similar number of phenomena. For illustra-tion purposes, Table 4 includes instances of source X  X lagiarism pairs from clusters c and c 5 . 5.2 Results and Discussion Our in-depth analysis uses F -measure, precision, and recall as evaluation measures (cf.
Section 4). Due to our interest in investigating the number of paraphrase plagiarism cases that state-of-the-art systems for plagiarism detection succeed in detecting, we pay special attention to recall.
 entire PAN-PC-10 corpus (Stein et al. 2011). The best recall values are around 0 . 70, with very good values of precision, some of them above 0 . 90. The results, when considering only the simulated cases, that is, those generated by manual paraphrasing, are presented cally compared with the results on the entire corpus, which also contains translated, verbatim, and automatically modified plagiarism. Manually created cases seem to be 938 much harder to detect than the other, artificially generated, cases. detecting simulated cases of plagiarism in the PAN-PC-10 corpus was stressed by Stein et al. (2011). This does not necessarily imply that automatically generated cases were easy to detect. When the simulated cases in the PAN-PC-10 corpus were generated, volunteers had specific instructions to create rewritings with a high obfuscation degree.
Figure 5 (c) shows the evaluation results when considering only the cases included in the P4P corpus. Note that the shorter a plagiarized case is, the harder it seems to be to detect (cf. Potthast et al. 2010, Table 6), and the P4P corpus is composed precisely of the shortest cases of simulated plagiarism in the PAN-PC-10; that is, cases no longer than 50 words.

P4P corpus. We focus on the comparison between the results obtained in the extreme identical cases) and quantitative (less paraphrase phenomena) complexity, is the one containing plagiarism cases that are easiest to detect. Cluster c the highest linguistic complexity (relevance of the semantics-based changes), is the one containing the most difficult plagiarism cases to detect. The results obtained over changes (most of which are similar to identical cases) causes a plagiarism detector to have relatively more success in detecting them. These results are clearly observed through the values of recall obtained by the different detectors. Moreover, a relation ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) 940 (a) (b) (c) between recall and precision exists: In general terms, high values of recall come with higher values of precision. To sum up, there exists a correlation between linguistic and quantitative complexity and performance of the plagiarism detection systems: More complexity implies worse performance of the systems. are not the ones that performed the best at the Pan-10 competition. By still considering and Nawab, Stevenson, and Clough (2010) (Figure 5 (c)), are far from the top detectors (a) (b) (c) 942 in the competition (Figure 5 (a). On the one hand, Nawab, Stevenson, and Clough (2010) apply greedy string tiling, which aims at detecting as long as possible identical frag-ments. As a result, this approach clearly outperforms the rest of detectors when dealing with cases with a high density of identical fragments ( c the approach of Costa-juss ` a et al. (2010) outperform the others when dealing with the cases in the remaining clusters. The reasons are twofold: (i) their pre-processing strategy (which includes case-folding, stopword removal, and stemming) looks at minimizing the differences in the form caused by some paraphrase operations; (ii) their technique based on dot X  X lot (which considers isolated words) is flexible enough to identify frag-ments that share some identical words only. Cluster c 3 is again somewhere in between c and c 2 . The results by Nawab, Stevenson, and Clough (2010) and Costa-juss ` a et al. (2010) are very similar in this case. The former shows a slightly better performance because the system is good at detecting identical cases and they have a high presence in spelling and format changes.
 system when dealing with paraphrase plagiarism (Costa-juss ` a et al. 2010) are both based on the dot X  X lot technique. Whereas Grozea and Popescu (2010a) use character 16-grams without any pre-processing, Costa-juss ` a et al. (2010) apply case-folding, stopword re-moval, and stemming pre-processing, and use word 1-grams. This latter approach is much more flexible than the former one in terms of paraphrase plagiarism detection. 6. Conclusions and Future Insights
The starting point of this article is that paraphrasing is the linguistic mechanism many plagiarism cases rely on. Our aim was to investigate why paraphrase plagiarism is so difficult to detect by state-of-the-art plagiarism detectors, and, especially, to understand which types of paraphrases underlie plagiarism acts, which are the most challenging, and how to proceed to improve plagiarism detection systems.
 detecting paraphrase plagiarism, we annotated a subset of the manually simulated plagiarism cases in the PAN-PC-10 corpus with a paraphrase typology, spawning the
P4P corpus. P4P is the only available collection of plagiarism cases manually annotated with paraphrase types, constituting a new resource for the computational linguistics communities interested in paraphrasing and plagiarism.
 distribution of paraphrase mechanisms. In the light of these groupings, the performance of the systems in the Second International Competition on Plagiarism Detection was analyzed. The resulting insights are the following: (a) there exists a correlation between phrases) complexity and performance of the plagiarism detection systems: More com-plexity results in a worse performance of the systems; (b) same-polarity substitutions and addition/deletion are the mechanisms used the most when plagiarizing; and (c) plagiarized fragments tend to be shorter than their source. Interestingly, the latter two insights hold when analyzing real cases of paraphrase plagiarism and text re-use.
On the basis of the idea that solving the most frequent paraphrase mechanisms means solving most paraphrase plagiarism cases, and given that same-polarity substitutions and addition/deletion are the most used paraphrase mechanisms by far, we have identified the following promising lines for future research: (i) an appropriate use of already existing lexical knowledge resources, such as WordNet development and exploitation of new empirically built resources, such as a lexicon of paraphrase expressions that could be easily obtained from the P4P and other corpora annotated at the paraphrase level; and (iii) the application of measures for estimating the expected length of a plagiarized fragment given its source.
