 Owing to the real-time and fast growing features, social network becomes a new media for advertising companies, politicians and even government to spread of infor-believed that target influencers usually lead to a vast propagation of information across the social networks. In viral marketing, advertisers target these influencers and hope they can influence their friends to use the product. And then through word of mouth effect, they finally trigger a huge cascade of influence so that many people will use the product. In politics, parties nominate influencers will be most likely to win the election. Besides, everyone has different influence level. As for viral marketing, if advertisers target top influencers, the co mpany needs to pay more money to promote their product. By knowing the influence level, the company can choose the proper target influencers based on their budget to maximize their profit. As for politics, party nominates a person of local influence to president would most likely lose the game. It is thus important to discover and discriminate the influence level of users. 
Several studies in social network focus on the issue of social influence. Considering the impact of social influence, Agarwal et al . [1] addressed the problem on identifying reported that weak ties, responsible for the propagation of novel information, may play a more dominant role in the dissemination of information than currently believed. 
Identification of influencers by using Twitter follower graph has caught much at-tention from recent research studies. Many approaches are proposed to solve this problem by considering different influence measures. Lee et al. [4] proposed a method to find influencers based on both the temporal order of information adoption and the link structure. Kwak et al. [5] compared thr ee different measures of influence, namely followers, page-rank and retweets and found that the ranking of the influencers dif-fered by these three measures. And the analysis of network topology showed low reciprocity. Besides, a consistent argument of low reciprocity was found by Cha et al. [6]. They also made a comparative analysis of three different measures of influence, namely followers, retweets and user mentions, which were used to evaluate the social influence. Their results presented that the number of followers may not be the best measure of the influence. However, Weng et al. [7] contradicted the observation by Cha et al. [6] and reported that their study exhibited the phenomenon of high reci-procity which can be explained by homophily. Moreover, based on this finding, they proposed a TwitterRank measure, similar to the work by Haveliwala [8] to find topic-sensitive influential twitterers. Bakshy et al. [9] uncovered an interesting observation that the ordinary influencers would be the most cost-effective in many circumstances, only under some circumstances the most influential users are the most cost-effective. Note that the ordinary influencers are defined by them as individuals who exert aver-age or even less-than-average influence. The above researches have been proposed different measures to find the influencers. Ho wever, there is no researches tackle this issue from the perspective of social diversities of the influenced people. Our basic idea is that if a user influences more diverse people, he/she will gain more influence. Since each of these diverse people would contribute to an independent information flow and lastly trigger a large cascade effect to make propagation disperse further and looping effect which renders the information propagation end within the cluster of people without dispersing outside the loop. 
In the previous studies, they consider a user will have more influence potential if he/she influences more people. However, they don X  X  consider the degree of difficulty people with high social diversity than those with low social diversity. People with fluence each other so that speed the influence spread. By contrast, diverse people have without getting any benefit from social similarity. So such influence spread is more great impact on the influence of a user. 
As mentioned above, we conjecture that the social diversities of the influenced people may play an important role in identifying influencers. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no previous research studies targeted to this issue in detec-tion of influencers. Thus, it remains unclear to what extent and in what way the effect of the social diversities of the influenced people would be imposed on the detection of influencers. In this paper, we therefore focus on understanding the impact of social Twitter retweet-follower graph. Our study provides clear evidences that the social diversity feature is an essential factor in detection of influencers. For the purpose of this study, a set of Twitter data was prepared over the two weeks, from December 4 2012 to December 17 2012. First, 600 out of top 1000 users and their two levels of followers, covering 5,894 users, were obtained from 400,967 retweets. Second, we crawled all followers of every user. Subsequently, we placed those followers in a queue to be crawled, thereby finding their followers, who were then also placed in the queue, and so on. A follower graph is then constructed. The retweet and follower graph are combined to further construct a retweet-follower graph of 152,119 users, of 169,942 edges, of 192,437 message propagations. To elim-inate ambiguity in our analysis, we removed the users who published excessive tweets. As a result, we had a total of 151,305 users for later analysis. 3.1 Kernel Ideas Twitter user (twitterer) is followed by his/her followers who can read and even share the tweet published by him with their friends via retweeting. We call these followers who are influenced by the twitterer to share information with their friends as media-mediators and thereby we made the following assumptions. The twitterer will gain higher influence if his/her mediators have higher influence. The mediators have high-er influence if they have higher social diversity. That is to say, the twitterer will exert more influence if his/her followers have higher social diversity. The goal of this paper is to find such influential users (influencer s) in a social network via considering the social diversities from the mediators to evaluate their corresponding influence scores. To achieve this goal, we extend PageRank to propose three diversity-dependent ap-proaches, incorporating concepts of transition probability and social diversity, to measure the influence of twitterers. Notice that, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first one to introduce the concept of social diversities from the mediators to identi-fy influencers in a social network. 3.2 Transition Probability Transition probability is measured as how much attention the twitterer could draw as one. Note that, in this case, only one message propagation in each of directed follows. 
The transition probability of the message propagated from u i to u j is defined as: mp ij is number of messages propagated from u i to u j , and number of messages u j received. difference between our work and theirs. They take following relationship into ac-count, when measuring the transition probability, while we consider the retweeting relationship. 3.3 Social Diversity Our idea is that if a user exerts influence on people with high diversity, diverse people would contribute to independent informatio n flows and trigger a large cascade effect to make propagation disperse further and faster. As shown in Fig. 2b, u a influences u e , u and u g to produce three independent information flows and eventually trigger a large cascade of information propagation. On the contrary, exert influence on people with less diversity might bring a looping effect which renders the information propa-gation end within the cluster of people without dispersing outside the loop. As shown within the cluster form by u b , u c and u d . Furthermore, we believe that a user needs to while u a may only need to influence one of them and finally reach all of them via the effect of social similarity. Social diversities of user X  X  mediators are thus hypothesized to have a great impact on the influence of a user. Social diversity is measured as one divided by the size of cluster. As for the case in ties of u e , u f and u g are all one. To solve the problem of identification of influencers, we consider the transition prop-agation and social diversity to develop a diversity-dependent influence (DI) measure. Our goal aims to use DI measure to find the influencers. We then extend PageRank [10] to propose two models to evaluate the DI measure, including prior model and propagation model. Each model possesses its own physical meaning and is able to determine the influence of users efficiently and effectively. We describe and discuss each of them in the following. 4.1 The Prior Model We first describe the processing on finding social diversity for prior model. The social diversity prior i SD is estimated by the community structure. If the nodes in the communi-ty formed by node v i and its descendants are more dense connections, node v i would as follows: node v i and its descendants. where  X  is a parameter between 0 and 1 to control the weight of social diversity. The lower  X  is, the higher weight the social diversity will have, and vice versa. The calculation of prior i T is similar to PageRank [10], but with a small change, defined as where n is the number of nodes in G , d is a damping factor set around 0.85, 
XTPijDIS = , YTPmj =  X  . 4.2 The Propagation Model Social diversity is determined by the community structure for the prior model. However, it might be more reasonable in real-world to take the flow of influence propagation into account on estimating the social diversity. To account for the relative variants of propagation matrices, then star algorithm [11] is employed to do the clustering, according to the clustering, social diversity is finally evaluated. Calculation of social diversities of mediators, considering true influence propagation or not, for two proposed algorithms (zero-one spread and weighted spread) are described as follows. Social Diversity Calculation with Static Propagation Matrix: Different from prior model, the main concept of these two methods is to calculate social diversity by con-sidering a static propagation matrix, not simply by community structure. Static propagation matrix: zero-one spread first construct a propagation matrix nn T  X  , spread, weighted spread cons iders the real number of message propagation and calcu-lates ( , ) ij TTPij = in the initial propagation matrix. constructed, from G  X  , by the node with highest degree and its associated nodes. Social diversity calculation: After clustering, the social diversity of node v i associated with v j ((,) ei j E  X  ) defined as follows is based on the size of the cluster it belongs to. where g ij is the size of the cluster v j belongs to. DI Measure for Propagation Model: Considering the transition probability and social diversities of mediators, the DI measure can be calculated iteratively for zero-one spread and weighted spread, respectively by where outbound link, and n is the number of nodes in G . 5.1 Discrimination of Influencers of Different Influence Levels In order to evaluate our approaches, we conducted an experiment in which results from our models were compared to those from PageRank. BA model [12] was then employed to generate a synthetic social network in which node A was connected to five independent groups of 1000 nodes while node B only connected to one of them, as shown in Figure 3. These two nodes have the same number of out-degree nodes and their out-degree nodes got similar rankings by PageRank. Since node A has the same number but more diverse out-degree nodes compared to node B, the influence level by node A is thus higher than node B. Table 1 presented the scores and ranks of node A and node B calculated by our methods and PageRank. These two nodes have the similar scores and ranks by PageRank since they have the same number and similar ranking of out-degree nodes. Compared to PageRank, our methods all showed that there was a significant difference from scores and ranks of these two nodes. Our methods performed better and successfully discriminate the influence level via considering the social diversity of ou t-degree nodes (the influenced people). 5.2 Effect of Social Diversities from Children A comparative analysis was then performed in order to clarify the performance of our approaches. BA model was then employed to generate a synthetic social network in which node A was connected to five independent groups of 1000 nodes, denoted as G . Additional three social networks, named G 1 to G 3 , were subsequently generated by adding 5000, 10000, 15000 links among five groups, as shown in Figure 4. 
The independence level of five groups decreased from G 0 to G 3 , that is, the social diversity of nodes within the groups decreased with the adding links. Five groups might eventually be clustered into one by adding more enough links. In a real-world, the denser group means people within the group interact to each other frequently. This clustering effect is often driven by the social similarity, to a certain extent, loses social diversity. The influence scores in our methods fall when the social diversities of children decrease (Fig. 5a), but a similar re lationship is also presented in PageRank. 
In order to measure the effect of our methods relative to PageRank, computed as either the difference or ratio between the influence score by our methods and Page-finding suggests that social diversity of child in our methods is most likely to make an impact on influence score of node A. The relative impact on the influence is highest diversities of out-degree nodes could alter the influence level of node A. Our methods all could better capture the variances in soci al diversities of children to discover and discriminate the influencers of different influence level. 
The weighted spread scheme performs be st. The zero-one spread scheme did not consider the actual number of message pr opagations and it treats as one message propagation no matter how many times the message being propagated. The calcula-tion of child X  X  social diversity in prior model is based on the network structure and not to consider the distribution of influence propagation. Thus, zero-one spread and prior model might underestimate the effect of child X  X  social diversity and not to reflect the real ranking level. To give a sense of how well our approach works, we further compare the users which fall into the class of media. The difference between the ranks computed by weighted spread and by PageRank was measured, as shown in Table 2. Reuters Top News and The Washington Post are international media. Since the impact of their name value, they often draw attention from numbers of followers from all walks of life to read and share their published tweets with friends and make the information propagation quick and far. Thus, our method and PageRank obtained a similar ranking. 
As for The New Yorker, Newsweek, NPR Politics and ELLE Magazine, their ranks dropped a lot when compared to those by PageRank. Take a further examination, we can find The New Yorker is a local medium and both NPR Politics and ELLE Maga-zine talked about specific subjects ( i.e., politics and lifestyle). They might appeal to a effect of social diversities from their influenced people will be imposed on their influ-ence score, leading to worse ranks. In this paper, we address the problem of identification of influencers in social net-works by introducing the concepts of social diversities of the influenced people and influence propagation. We believe that this is the first study to use social diversities of the influenced people to measure the influence of users. We then proposed three di-versity-dependent schemes to identify influencers via measuring the influence scores of users. The prior model is based on the network structure while the propagation model considers the pattern of influence spread. 
Comparative analyses on synthetic social networks suggest that the social diversi-ties of the influenced people may play an important role in the identification of vari-ous influence levels of influencers. Comparative analysis between our methods shows that weighted spread is superior to the othe rs. We also apply weighted spread to Twit-ter data and compare with PageRank. Our results show that our strategy performs better. It implies that the pattern of the influence propagation could be beneficial to discriminate the influencers. Our proposed scheme is therefore practical and feasible to be deployed in the real world.
