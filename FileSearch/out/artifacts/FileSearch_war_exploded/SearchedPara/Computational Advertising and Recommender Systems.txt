 Computational advertising is an emerging scientific disci-pline, at the intersection of large scale search and text analy-sis, information retrieval, statistical modeling, machine learn-ing, optimization, and microeconomics. The central chal-lenge of computational advertising is to find the  X  X est match X  between a given user in a given context and a suitable ad-vertisement. The context could be a user entering a query in a search engine ( X  X ponsored search X ), a user reading a web page ( X  X ontent match X  and  X  X isplay ads X ), a user convers-ing on a cell phone ( X  X obile advertising X ), and so on. The information about the user can vary from scarily detailed to practically nil. The number of potential advertisements might be in the billions. Thus, depending on the definition of  X  X est match X  this challenge leads to a variety of massive optimization and search problems, with complicated con-straints.

The main part of this talk will give an introduction to computational advertising and present some illustrative re-search. In the second part we will discuss connections to recommender systems and present a couple of open prob-lems of potential interest to both communities.
