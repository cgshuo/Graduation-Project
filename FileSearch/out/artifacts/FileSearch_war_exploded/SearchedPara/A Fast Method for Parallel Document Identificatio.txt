 Parallel documents are documents that are mutual translations. There are a number of reasons one might want to either identify parallel documents, or confirm that a pair of documents are in fact parallel. Most prominently, one could use pairs of automat-ically detected parallel documents to build parallel corpora. Parallel corpora have many uses in natural language processing, and their dearth has been iden-tified as a major bottleneck (Diab, 2004). They have been employed in word sense disambiguation (Diab and Resnik, 2002), automatic construction of bilin-gual dictionaries (McEwan et al., 2002), and induc-ing statistical machine translation models (Koehn et al., 2003). In addition to building parallel corpora, one can envision other uses for parallel document identification, such as cross-language information retrieval (Chen and Nie, 2000).

Much work on identifying pairs of parallel doc-uments focuses on the use of external features of the documents, rather than content. Chen and Nie (2000) describe PTMiner, a cross-language informa-tion retrieval system. They consider a number of factors in determining if a pair of documents are par-allel, including document size, date, URL, and lan-guage flag. For example, if a document is available in both French and English, it is common for the French document X  X  URL to contain .fr and the En-glish to contain .en In addition to these measures, they consider website structure.

McEwan et al. (2002) find parallel documents which they then use to automatically build a bilin-gual dictionary. In their system, they first gener-ate a set of candidate pairs based on manual selec-tion, or advanced search engine use. They then filter the pairs to remove non-parallel pairs. First, they confirm that one of each pair is in each of the de-sired languages using tuned lists of stop-words, then they compare the documents based on length in to-kens, and HTML markup. Resnik and Smith (2003) use a similar idea of candidates and filters in their STRAND system. STRAND filters the documents based on aligning them by length in tokens and lo-cation of HTML markup in the documents.
 Apart form the work done on external metrics, Patry and Langlais (2005) investigated a number of content-based metrics. They consider several docu-ment features, including the numbers, proper names and punctuation contained within, as well as docu-ment length, and alignment scores between candi-date pairs. The features are then used to train an Ada-Boost classifier, which makes decisions based on edit-distance and cosine scores. They experi-mented with several combinations of features, one of which achieved 100% correctness when tested on 487 out of 488 parallel documents that constitute the English-Spanish portion of the EUROPARL corpus. They conclude that a bag-of-words approach is infe-rior to one that considers feature order.

In this work, we demonstrate that a much sim-pler approach can achieve equally good results. Our method does not depend on hand-coded linguistic knowledge and requires no training data, which may be unavailable for some language pairs. In addition, thanks to its simplicity, our method is very fast. One can consider the parallel document identifica-tion problem to be as follows:
We initially designed a cognate-based approach to the problem, which employed a combination of or-thographic word similarity measures to identify cog-nates such as French nombres and English numbers between documents. In order to make the method computationally feasible, potential cognates were filtered based on word order, location in the docu-ment, frequency, and length. However, we found that a faster and simpler procedure, which is de-scribed below, performed extremely well, eliminat-ing the need for a more sophisticated approach.
We propose to identify parallel documents by counting the number of unique words that appear in both documents. The documents are treated as bags of words, that is, their word order is not considered. From each document, we extract a set of words that are at least 4 characters long and have frequency 1. Given a document in language A , we select the doc-ument in language B that shares the largest number of these words. An implementation based on hash tables ensures speed.

Since identical words of frequency 1 are almost certainly cognates, this method can be seen as an extremely conservative approach to cognate detec-tion. In practice, most of unique identical words are proper nouns. We performed experiments on two different par-liamentary corpora. The English-French Canadian Hansards from the 36th sitting of the Canadian Parliament (Germann, 2001) was selected as the development dataset. In testing on the Canadian Hansards, English was used as the Language A, and French as the Language B. Our approach correctly identified all parallel documents.

In order to allow for a direct comparison with the work of Patry and Langlais (2005), we adopted the EUROPARL corpus of parliamentary proceedings (Koehn, 2002) as our test dataset. However, rather than focusing on a single language pair, we per-formed tests on all 110 language pairs involving the following 11 languages: German, English, Greek, Finnish, Swedish, Dutch, French, Danish, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. Diacritics were stripped from the documents of all languages. Since Greek utilizes a different script from the rest of the docu-ments. we used a straightforward context-free map-ping to convert every Greek character to its nearest roman equivalent.
 Some of the 488 documents available in EU-ROPARL were missing in Finnish, Swedish, Greek and Danish. In particular, Greek had 392 docu-ments, Danish had 487 documents, and Swedish and Finnish had 433 each. In such cases, the parallels of those missing documents were excluded from the language A for that test.

The EUROPARL documents range in size from 114 tokens (13 lines) to 138,557 tokens (11,101 lines). The mean number of tokens is 59,387 (2,826 lines). Each orientation of each language pair was tested. For example, for the language pair English-Dutch, tests were run twice -once with English as language A and Dutch as language B , and once the other way around. The results for a given lan-guage pair are not necessarily symmetric. Hence-forth when referring to a language pair, we list the language A as the first one.
For each document and each language pair, an in-dividual test was run. An individual test consisted of finding, for a given document in language A , its parallel in the language B set. Since we did not take advantage of the pigeon-hole constraint, the individ-ual tests were independent from each other.

No changes were made to the approach once test-ing on the EUROPARL corpus began, in order to avoid adapting it to work on any particular data set. In total, only 20 of the 49872 tests did not pro-duce the correct result (0.04% error rate). There was one incorrect selection in the English-Spanish language pair, one in the English-German pair, as well as in each of 18 language pairs involving Dan-ish or English as a Language A. All of the incorrect results can be traced to mistranslation, or to miss-ing/truncated documents. In particular, one of the documents is severely truncated in Danish and En-glish, one of the German documents missing a por-tion of its text, and the Spanish version of one of the documents contains a number of phrases and sen-tences of English, apparently belonging to the En-glish version of the text.

Effectively, when this method fails it is because the input does not match the problem definition. Re-call that the problem was defined as selecting a doc-ument d B that is the correct parallel to d A , a document in language A . Failure cases occurred because there was no correct parallel to the d each of the  X  X ncorrect X  results is a manifestation of an editorial error in the EUROPARL corpus. One could see this approach being used as an aid to iden-tifying fragmentary documents and mistranslations in parallel corpora.

Encouraged by the excellent accuracy of our method, we decided to try an even simpler approach, which is based on words of frequency 1 in the entire set of documents in a given language, rather than in a single document. For every document from a lan-guage A, we select as its parallel the document from language B that shares the most of those words with it. However, the results obtained with this method were clearly inferior, with the error rates ranging from 2.9% for Dutch to 27.3% for Finnish. The implications of this work are two-fold. First, it shows a simple, fast, and effective method for identifying parallel documents. Second, it calls into question the usefulness of parliamentary proceed-ings for the evaluation of parallel document identifi-cation schemes.

The method described in this paper is sufficiently simple as to be used as a baseline for comparison with other methods. No information is shared be-tween trials, no word similarity measures are used, and word order is ignored. The method does not incorporate any language-specific linguistic knowl-edge, and it has shown itself to be robust across lan-guages without any alterations. The only constraint is that the languages must share an alphabet, or can be converted into a common alphabet. Furthermore, it requires no training phase, which would likely have to be repeated for every pair of languages. Our method achieves 99.9% accuracy on the English-Spanish language pair, which roughly matches the best result reported by Patry and Langlais (2005) (who apparently removed one doc-ument pair from the collection). However, their method requires a training phase on aligned parallel documents, making it time consuming and inconve-nient to adapt their approach to a new language pair, even in cases where such document-aligned corpora are available. In addition, their top accuracy value corresponds to only one of several combination of features  X  the results with classifiers based on other combinations of features were lower.

We implemented our method using hash tables, which store the words occurring in a document to-gether with their frequencies. This makes the entire search for a parallel document roughly linear in the total number of words in all the documents. Average total wall-clock time spent for one test with one lan-guage A document and 488 language B documents was 59.4 seconds. on a AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Proces-sor 3500+. Profiling showed that on average 99.7% of the wall-clock time was spent on I/O operations, with the remainder taken by hash table lookups and string equality checks. Clearly, little speed improve-ment is possible. In contrast to the speed of our approach, the approach used by Patry and Langlais (2005) requires not only the time to train a classifier, but also the time to compute edit distance between many document pairs.

In addition to yielding a simple, accurate and fast method for parallel document identification, our re-sults suggest that relatively  X  X lean X  collections of parliamentary proceedings of the EUROPARL type may be inappropriate for testing parallel document identification schemes in general. If a very simple approach can achieve near perfect accuracy in such a domain, perhaps the task is too easy. Future gen-eral parallel document identification systems should be tested on more challenging datasets. While the approach presented here has been very successful thus far, there are a number of extensions that could be made to make it more applicable in general. More work could allow it to deal with cases of missing parallel documents, datasets with fewer proper names, and even yield knowledge of the dif-ficulty of the problem in general.

First, the problem definition could be expanded to include cases where there is no valid parallel for a given language A document in the language B doc-ument set. This could take the form of establishing a score or significance threshold. For example, if there were no document in the language B set that shared more than the minimum number of unique words with the document d approach might return no parallel for that document.
Second, it might be revealing to run further tests with this approach on other types of text than parlia-mentary proceedings. What types of text would re-quire a more sophisticated approach? The answer to that question might have implications for the range of text types that ought to be used to comprehen-sively test parallel document identification systems.
The exact matching of words is a critical feature of our approach, which enables it to perform quick comparisons of documents by representing them as sets of low-frequency words stored in hash tables. However, it is also a limitation because many cross-language cognates are not orthographically identi-cal. A system relying on non-binary word similar-ity measures rather than on total identity of words would be more complex and slower, but also more robust across different domains of text. We have presented a viable, simple method for identification of homogeneous parallel documents. This method uses less resources and time than other content-based methods, a valuable asset when many languages lack linguistic resources. In addition to showing the effectiveness of our approach, the re-sults of the experiments suggest that parliamentary proceedings may be inappropriate for parallel docu-ment identification scheme testing.
