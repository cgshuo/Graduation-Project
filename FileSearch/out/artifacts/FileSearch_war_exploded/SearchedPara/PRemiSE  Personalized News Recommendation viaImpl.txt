 A variety of news recommender systems based on different strategies have been proposed to provide news personaliza-tion services for online news readers. However, little re-search work has been reported on utilizing the implicit  X  X o-cial X  factors (i.e., the potential influential experts in news reading community) among news readers to facilitate news personalization. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of integrating content-based methods, collaborative filtering and information diffusion models by employing probabilis-tic matrix factorization techniques. We propose PRemiSE , anovel P ersonalized news Re commendation framework via i m pl i cit S ocial E xperts, in which the opinions of potential influencers on virtual social networks extracted from implicit feedbacks are treated as auxiliary resources for recommen-dation. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy and ef-fectiveness of our method, particularly, on handling the so-called cold-start problem.

Recommending news articles in personalized web services has become a promising research direction with the devel-opment of Internet technologies for fast accessing real-time information around the world. Popular news portals, such as Google News and Yahoo! News, have gained increasing attention from a gigantic amount of online news readers. With the large volume of news events happening everyday, an important issue of online news reading services is how to help readers find interesting articles that maximally match their reading appetites, which is called personalized news recommendation .

To address the aforementioned problem, most researchers try to develop news recommender systems by utilizing content-based methods (i.e., analyzing the content of news articles to model users X  reading preferences) or collaborative filter-ing (i.e., exploring similar users X  reading behaviors) or hy-brid version of these two techniques (i.e., combining these two types of methods to alleviate their corresponding draw-backs). Despite a few recent advances, a couple of critical issues of news personalization remain unsolved in previous studies:
Many prior research efforts [12, 20] indicate that when there are enough rating records, collaborative filtering ap-proaches can generate better recommendations. However, collaborative filtering approaches fail to extract similar user groups on insufficient data; in such case, researchers turn to explore the potential of  X  X ord of mouth X  by employing real social networks, e.g. social trust [15, 9]. Since a real social network is usually not readily available, a few researchers model information flow patterns in the virtual social network where people unintentionally influence each other [24]. Prior collaborative filtering and social networking approaches are generally not applicable to new users and new items, since they have no historical ratings. For new items, the con-tent of the items is usually helpful [6, 3, 4]. For new users, many researchers [16, 22, 26] collect simple user profiles by requiring new users to fill out a list of questionnaires. The questionnaire-based approaches require explicit user inputs. In addition, the quality of user answers can not be guaran-teed.

In our work, to resolve the data sparsity and cold-start issues mentioned above, we propose PRemiSE ,anovel P ersonalized news Re commendation framework via i m pl i cit S ocial E xperts, by incorporating content information, col-laborative filtering and information diffusion in virtual so-cial network into probabilistic matrix factorization. Ratings are generated as the aggregation of user preference, seman-tic item profiles and preferences of the most influential ex-perts. In this way, the semantics of item profiles and the structure of implicit user network are taken into account, leading to better recommendation results. New items are recommended to users who are specifically interested in the associated topics. For new users without any (or enough) ratings and collaborations, items are chosen based on ex-pert opinions in the reading community. In summary, the contribution of our proposed recommendation framework is capable of handling the cold-start problem by leveraging the opinions of implicit  X  X xperts X , and is able to generate bet-ter predictions by bridging  X  X ord of mouth X  and  X  X sers with similar tastes X .
Recently, recommending news articles or other document-format web objects has attracted more and more research at-tentions. Existing news recommender systems can be roughly categorized into three different groups: content-based, col-laborative filtering and hybrid methods.

Content-based Recommenders: Content-based rec-ommenders model news readers X  reading preferences based on the text content of news items via bag-of-word model or topic models. Such representations are then used as the base to calculate the affinity score between newly-published news articles and the user preference profiles. Representative ex-amples include [1, 6]. Newsjunkie [6], which filters news stories by formal measures of information novelty, shows how the techniques can be used to custom-tailor newsfeeds based on a user X  X  reading history. YourNews [1] intends to increase the transparency of adapted news delivery by allow-ing users to adapt user profiles. Content-based methods are able to generate reasonable recommendations for new users in content-wise; However in some cases, a bag of words might not be sufficient to capture the reading behaviors of users.
Collaborative Filtering: Collaborative filtering based systems assume that some intrinsic correlations exist among the reading behaviors of users, i.e., if two users are inter-ested in the same topic, they would read similar news arti-cles relevant to this topic. Based on this assumption, most collaborative filtering methods analyze the click behaviors of news readers instead of the news content, either using a group of users X  X imilar X  to the given user to predict news rat-ings [19, 21], or modeling users X  behaviors in a probabilistic way [7, 17]. Recently, matrix factorization [12] (MF) and probabilistic matrix factorization [20] (PMF) have revealed to be superior than traditional k -nearest neighbor collab-orative filtering methods in other scenarios such as movie recommendation. Extensions of MF &amp; PMF have been pub-lished on implicit feedbacks [11] and k -nearest neighbors [10] etc. Collaborative filtering makes a strong assumption that users X  behaviors overlap with each other; however, such an assumption might not hold, especially when the item uni-verse changes frequently. In addition, collaborative filtering cannot effectively handle the cold-start problem, i.e., a user does not have enough consumption history.

Hybrid Recommenders: In practice, the reading be-havior of a news reader can be related to not only the news content, but the reading behaviors of other news readers. Hybrid recommenders aim at combining both content fil-tering and collaborative filtering to provide more meaning-ful recommendation. Example s of hybrid recommenders in-clude [3, 4], in which the inability of collaborative filtering to recommend news items is c ommonly alleviated by com-bining it with content-based filtering. Recently, researchers start using social network to model online readers X  interac-tions. A couple of algorithms relevant to this [5, 13, 18, 23, 25] have been proposed in the last decade. Researchers also focus on utilizing the trust relations among social me-dia users to derive the recommendation solution[15]. [8] per-forms a random walk model combining the trust-based and the collaborative filtering approach for recommendation.
Summary: Our proposed model in this paper differs from existing works in the following aspects: (1) In previous works, real social networks (e.g., Epinion X  X  trust network) are required. In this paper, hidden diffusion patterns are modeled on a virtual social network. (2) To the best of our knowledge, only ExpertsCF in [2] applies a set of experts for recommendation. While ExpertsCF is a variation of collab-orative filtering using  X  X rue experts X  obtained from external data source, we automatically detect experts with powerful influence in the semantic community inside the data. (3)We embed content-based, collaborative filtering and social net-working approaches into a unified probabilistic framework. We believe such a balanced prediction is consistent to the real decision making process in news consumption.
In basic matrix factorization models, user-item rating ma-trix is decomposed to user and item factors. Suppose users X  preferences can be represented as K  X  dimensional vectors {
U i } ,i  X  1  X  M , each of which indicates how much the given user prefers the K underlying factors. Similarly, item coefficients in corresponding factors are denoted by { V j 1  X  N . Basic matrix factorization models assume user-item rating is generated from the correlation of factors, i.e.,  X  r i,j  X  U i V j . Since most recommendation systems preprocess ratings to be in the range of [0 , 1], usually a monotonic func-tion g ( x )=1 / (1 + exp(  X  x )) is adopted to project U the desired scale. A probabilistic expression of this intuition can be defined in Eq.(1), as illustrated in Figure 1(a):
Basic probabilistic matrix factorization models fall into the category of collaborative filtering, and thus it can au-tomatically detect users with similar tastes and items with similar ratings; however, it cannot capture the diffusion of information from person to person. The so-called  X  X ord of mouth X  is highly valuable in marketing, because individuals Figure 1: Graphical Presentation of Basic PMF and PRemiSE. tend to believe authorities when it comes to choice making. Suppose for a given user U i , we know a list of  X  X xperts X  who have significant influence on him/her, then we can borrow the  X  X xperts X  opinion to predict the given user X  X  reading be-havior. We assume influence relationship between  X  X xperts X  U e and user U i is denoted by  X  e,i .

Formally, the rating assigned from user U i to item V j is then drawn from several experts X  opinions, i.e.,  X  r i,j e  X  r e,j  X  e,i . Combining the two probabilistic generation pro-cesses, we have: where the parameters w 1 and w 2 coordinate the effect of collaborative filtering and  X  X ord of mouth X , subject to w w 2 =1. Notethat w 1 and w 2 are dynamic parameters. Intuitively, for experienced users, their preferences dominate their decision; while for unexperienced users, they are more likely to follow the experts.

The content of news also contains rich information. In general, word distribution is factor-dependent. Suppose  X  is the word space, where  X  w,k is the strength of word w cor-relating with factor k . We associate the TFIDF weighting of terms in each item profile with item factor and  X . Proba-bly each item j  X  X  profile w j is a Gaussian distribution whose mean is the product of item factors V and  X , i.e., where U, V,  X  are zero-mean spherical Gaussian priors, i.e.,
By combining collaborative filtering,  X  X ord of mouth X  in social networks and content semantics, PRemiSE is illus-trated in Figure 1(b).
Suppose we have learned U  X  ,V  X  ,  X   X  from the training set, then in PRemiSE we perform inference to predict ratings r in the test set. We consider the following four cases: 1. Existing Item by Existing User: If the user U i 2. Existing Item by New User: If the target user i 3. New Item by Existing User: For any incoming 4. New Item by New User: To predict how a new user
The news data set is crawled from several popular news service websites, ranging from July 15th, 2010 to Dec 16th, 2010 [14]. It contains the details of news articles (e.g., news title, content, published time, etc.) and user access history (e.g., anonymous users, accessed news items, accessed time, etc.). In order to investigate the feasibility of our  X  X xpert X  model, we consider two types of elements for constructing implicit social graph: news stories and named entities. In the experiment, news stories are formed by concatenating news title and news content, whereas named entities are extracted from news stories via information extraction tools as in [14].

For evaluation purpose, we divide the entire news data into two disjoint sets, where the first one ranges from July 15th, 2010 to September 30th, 2010, and the remaining falls into the second set. We then construct implicit social net-works for these two sets using the two types of elements, re-spectively. Hence we can obtain 4 different data sets. Note that in each data set, news stories associated with users X  ac-cess histories of the last 3 days are extracted to serve as the test data, whereas the remaining is treated as the training data. In dataset4, each user has rated at least 30 items (en-tities) in the training set, and each item has been accessed for more than 30 times. In the other three data sets, each user has at least 10 items in the training set, and each item has been rated by at least 10 individuals. The ratings in the Story data sets are binary. The ratings in the Entity data sets are numerical, which are the normalized accumulative visiting number by each user on each entity. The statistics of the four data sets is depicted in Table 1.
Benchmarks used in this comparative study include three recommendation algorithms, namely collaborative filtering (CF) [19], basic matrix factorization (MF) [12], and Latent Dirichlet Allocation filtering (LDA) [22]. In CF, the pre-dicted rating  X  r i,j from user i to item j is derived from i  X  X  similar users X  ratings on j , i.e., where the similarity between user k and i is defined as the cosine similarity over ratings. In basic matrix factorization, the predicted rating  X  r i,j is generated by Eq.(1). LDA is originally proposed to model topics in documents. In the experiments, we employ LDA to estimate the distri-bution over K topics of each item profile. Then we predict the probability of the given user to generate a given item, i.e., Here p ( z | V j ) ,p ( z | U i ) can be obtained by LDA. Using Bay-ersian rule, we have where we can assume p ( V )=1 /N . Intuitively, if the condi-tional probability by Eq.(9) is significantly larger than ran-dom, then the predicted rating should be definite, i.e.,
There is no mechanism in MF, CF and LDA-filtering to deal with the cold-start problem. We randomize a user factor in MF and LDA-filtering as a pseudo user, in CF the average rating is assigned as the predicted rating for new users and new items. In PRemiSE, the dynamic parameters w 1 ,w 2 are set to be w 1 =1 ,w 2 = 0 for users and items that appear in the training set, because after pre-processing users and items in the training set have enough ratings. We assume that they will not be affected much by local experts. The evaluation metric is RMSE, which measures the root mean square error from the predicted rating and the actual rating inthetestsets.Itcanbecalculatedas Figure 2: Comparative Study over parameter K in 4datasets.

As shown in Figure 2, the RMSEs of the 4 methods on pa-rameter K are presented for each data set. On all the data sets, collaborative filtering has maintained the worst per-formance, due to the sparsity of the data sets. The access frequency for news is relatively small compared with other types of items, e.g. music, movie, etc. Therefore standard collaborative filtering is not able to produce similar users. When we use entities as items, the performance of collab-orative filtering is slightly worse than using news articles, resulting from the less density of the entity data.
The performance of MF is better than collaborative fil-tering, but is slightly worse than LDA-filtering. Note that LDA-filtering is capable of predicting user X  X  preference on new items. Our analysis shows that when predicting exist-ing items for existing users, LDA-filtering is not better than MF. But it is superior in predicting new items for existing users. This suggests that in scenarios like news recommen-dation, the rich information contained in item profiles can be very helpful.
PRemiSE performs best on all data sets. The best K is different among each data set. For example, in dataset1, the best performance is achieved when K = 20, and in dataset2 it is K = 100. This indicates that for more complex data sets, more factors are required to capture the semantic dif-ference between items.
We now look further on how different strategies work for the cold-start problem. We compute RMSE on dataset1 for four cases: predict ratings for existing users (users exist in training set) to existing items (items exist in training set), predict ratings by existing users to new items (items that do not exist in training set), predict ratings by new users to existing items, and predict ratings by new users to new items. We abbreviate these four cases as oop, onp, nop, and nnp.

As mentioned above, MF, LDA-filtering and CF are not capable of handling all these cases. Our modifications are as follows: for onp, MF randomizes an item factor, and gener-ates ratings from the user factor and the pseudo item factor; LDA-filtering inferences the topic distribution for the new item, and generates ratings as usual. For nop, MF random-izes a user factor, and generates ratings from the pseudo user factor and the item factor; LDA-filtering randomizes the topic distribution for the new user, and generates rat-ings by the pseudo user topics and the item topics. For nnp, MF and LDA-filtering give a random guess. CF uses the average rating for onp, nop and nnp.

The RMSE performance of the four algorithms on the cold start problem and all rating predictions are shown in Figure 3. We can observe that PRemiSE is comparable with MF in existing item and existing user rating prediction, but outperforms MF and LDA-filtering in predicting cold start problems, including new users and new items.
