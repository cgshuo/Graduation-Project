 discretized models of time series have mostly been seen as an approximation to continuous point by a discussion (section 4). binary time series, indicating the presence of a single spik e inside a given time bin. 2.1 Representations of neural activity of the measurement and { u are characterized by its conditional intensity function  X  ( t | H ( t )) , defined as [1]: where H given by [1]: natively,  X  ( t | H In this case, the history term H Inside the bin, the process locally behaves like a Poisson pr ocess with constant rate  X  with t samples (apart from terms that are not dependent on  X  ( t | H such a Poisson regression model.

Adding samples from this inhomogeneous Poi sson process to the observed spikes results in a homogeneous Poisson process with rate C . 2.2 Goodness-of-fit tests for point processes modeled intensity function to the true intensity. 2.2.1 The time-rescaling theorem It states that if { u then rescaling via the transformation u 0 The spike time u 2.2.2 Thinning point processes geneous Poisson process with constant intensity C with C  X  max  X  ( t ) (the so-called dominant process) and keeping every spike at time t will be a homogeneous Poisson process with rate B (Figure 2B). low power.
 To circumvent this problem, we propose the following remedy : Let B  X  be a threshold which may can be repeated K times for a range of uniformly spaced B  X  s ranging from B to C (upper bound). this end, it transforms the ordered list of p-values p (1) , ..., p ( K ) into Kp (1) 2.2.3 Complementing point processes The idea of thinning might also be used the other way round. As sume the observations u generated by thinning a homogeneous Poisson process with ra te C using the modeled conditional intensity  X  ( t | H forward inversion of the thinning algorithms discussed in [ 2, 1].
 It might happen that the upper bound C of the modeled intensity is much larger than the average has to be used, again we propose Simes X  method (see previous s ection). 2.3 Creating surrogate point processes from time series Since the time-rescaling theorem can only be used when  X  ( t | H we propose to generate surrogate point process samples that are equivalent to the observed time discretized data produces a bias [17].

We can relate this to the point process framework using the following observations: Assume that p each bin 2 and that locally, the process behaves like a Poisson process . Then, p bin by first sampling from the distribution P (poisson) uniformly as in the case of the Poisson-GLMs. thinning and complementing procedure, K = 10 partitions were chosen (see section 2.2.2).

 For the examples of an inhomogeneous Poisson process and the Spike Response Model, thinning and complementing outperform the sensitivity of the simple time-rescaling procedure. They can is known to be sensitive to modeling the distribution of inte r-spike intervals [3]. processes, we bridge the gap between such discrete models an d point processes. That enables to single neurons as well as neural populations.
