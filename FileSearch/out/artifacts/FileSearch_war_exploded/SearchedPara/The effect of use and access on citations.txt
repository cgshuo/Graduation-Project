 1. Introduction
During the past decade substantial changes have occurred in the manner in which technical and schol-arly literature is accessed and read. While differing in detail from other disciplines, astronomy is broadly typical of the developments, and can be used as an example.

Astronomers now have near total unimpeded direct electronic access to nearly every important research of the nineteenth century, and to all the tabular numerical data contained in the modern article. These developments have had many sources, but four main developments stand out: The NASA Astrophysics
Data System (hereafter ADS) ( Kurtz et al., 1993; Kurtz et al., 2000 ), The ArXiv e-Print archive (hereafter et al., 1995 ), and the on-line data tables (beginning with Astronomy and Astrophysics, ( Genova et al., 2000;
Ochsenbein &amp; Lequeux, 1995 ). All these new services (and several others) are interconnected by a complex system of close collaborations and hyperlinks ( Boyce, 1998 ).

The tremendous use of these new forms of access has been well documented (e.g. ArXiv, 2004; Kurtz et al., 2005a ), and new bibliometric measures which make use of them are beginning to be used (e.g. Bollen, 2003; practice of citation, long the primary bibliometric indicator of the usefulness of an academic article.
Recently Lawrence (2001) and Brody et al. (2004) have demonstrated that articles which are available on-line at no charge are cited at substantially higher rates than those which are not. Kurtz (2004) has shown that restrictive access policies can cut article downloads to half the free access rate.

There are (at least) three possible, and non-exclusive, explanations for the effect noted by Lawrence (2001) and Brody et al. (2004) . (1) Because the access to the articles is unrestricted by any payment mech-anism authors are able to read them more easily, and thus they cite them more frequently; the open access (OA) postulate. (2) Because the article appears sooner it gains both primacy and additional time in press, and is thus cited more; the Early Access (EA) postulate. (3) Authors preferentially tend to promote (in this case by posting to the internet) the most important, and thus most citable, articles; the Self-selection bias (SB) postulate.

In this paper we present the results of two experiments designed to distinguish to what extent each of the postulated explanations holds true, for the astronomy literature. 2. Data 2.1. The OA and EA postulates Scholarly communication in astronomy is dominated by seven journals, The Astrophysical Journal, The Astrophysical Journal (Letters), The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics (which merged with Astronomy and Astrophysics
Supplement Series in 2001), The Astronomical Journal, and The Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific . Since the founding of the pan-European journal Astronomy and Astrophysics thirty-five years ago these journals have formed the core of the discipline.

In order to test the OA and EA postulates we use a data-set which consists of all references from articles published in one of these core journals to another article published in these journals, beginning in 1970. By restricting the citation universe to the core journals we minimize the effects of systematics, such as changes in the relative popularity of publishing in journals versus conference proceedings, on the usage trends we measure.

These citation data are maintained in the ADS database, and are nearly 100% complete. While the ori-ginal source for the ADS citation database was ISI, for the core astronomy journals this has now been to-the output of images of the article pages as analyzed by a character recognition program ( Accomazzi, Eich-horn, Kurtz, Grant, &amp; Murray, 1999; Demleitner et al., 2004 ). 2.2. The SB postulate
To test the SB postulate (vs. the combined OA and EA postulates) we use data concerning the 2592 articles published in 2003 by The Astrophysical Journal contained within the ADS database. We use the per article citation information, and the concordance between Astrophysical Journal articles and pre-prints in the ArXiv.
The choice of the data sample is somewhat arbitrary. The sample must sufficiently homogeneous that we do not measure differences in the citation practices of different disciplines; it must be old enough to have built up statistically significant differences between the more and less cited articles; and it must be new enough to measure the current behavior of ArXiv users. This sample meets these criteria.

The citations are as of 15 August 2004 and are taken from all sources known to the ADS. We use the entire data-set to maximize the signal to noise; because the cited articles are quite homogeneous, and the citation period is relatively short, there are no systematics which would require us to restrict the data set of citing articles.

The concordance is created by: (1) Parsing the information submitted by the authors to the ArXiv (yield-ing 70% of all 2003 ApJ articles); and (2) Comparing the title and author information for the ArXiv pub-lication with the Astrophysical Journal articles author and title information, using any additional author supplied information (yielding 4% of all 2003 ApJ articles).

As the ArXiv preprint can (and often does) have a different title than the corresponding journal article, indeed it can have a different author list, it is not possible to have a 100% complete concordance. By making spot checks, and by looking at each of the 200 most cited papers in detail, we estimate that we could be underestimating the fraction of ArXiv articles which correspond with Astrophysical Journal articles by 2%, but none of these are in the top 200 cited articles. Finding these (if present) would not significantly change any of our conclusions. 3. Technique 3.1. The OA and EA postulates
To test the OA and EA postulates we make note of the fact that substantial changes in ability of astron-omers to access research articles occurred during the decade of the 1990s. During this period the ArXiv was founded ( Ginsparg, 2001 ), it has since grown to where the majority of research articles in astronomy are submitted to it. Also during this period the ADS was founded ( Kurtz et al., 1993 ) and during the 36 month period ending in 1999 it (with the kind permission of the journals) scanned and put on-line all the back issues of the seven (then eight) core astronomy journals. In both cases the articles are available with-out cost through an easy to use web interface. Both services are heavily used ( ArXiv, 2004; Kurtz et al., 2005a ).

If increased access effects the citation rate we should be able to see changes in the citation rates for older postulate, as these articles have long since appeared, but are suddenly now available without charge, and without the need to go to a library. For the very new articles this tests a combination of the OA and EA postulates. The articles are available without charge, but also substantially before they are available in the journals.

We create a statistic to measure the citation rate which is insensitive to changes in the number of articles published during different periods, the probability P ( t , t particular article published during the period between t 0 that an article published at time t will cite an article published between 10 and 20 years before t . where citations( t , t 0 , D t ) is the number of citations in papers at time t to papers published between t t + D t before time t , N ( t ) is the number of papers published at time t , N ( t , t published in the period between t 0 and t 0 + D t before time t .

We use a one month granularity throughout, so N ( t ) is the number of articles published in a one month period of time, etc. 3.2. The SB postulate
To test the SB postulate we note that the magnitude of the combined OA and EA effects makes a clear prediction concerning the relative distribution of articles which had been submitted to the ArXiv versus articles which had not in a list of recent papers sorted by number of citations. The higher the ratio of cita-tion rates between ArXiv-submitted articles and non-ArXiv-submitted articles the lower the fraction of non-ArXiv-submitted articles expected in the top 100 or 200 cited articles in the sample.
Given an ArXiv/non-ArXiv citation ratio, and the unbiased frequency distribution of citations one can easily determine the probability that a particular number of non-ArXiv submitted papers will be in the top 100 or 200 most cited papers by Monte Carlo simulation. Comparing these probabilities with the actual measured number allows one to accept or reject the hypothesis that OA + EA effects alone can account for the measured distribution of highly cited articles.

To estimate what the relative distribution of citations for ArXiv-submitted and non-ArXiv-submitted articles would be were there no SB effect we must estimate what the total citation distribution would be in the absence of any SB effect. While we could use a Lotke type power law we choose to estimate this, and all other elements in our stochastic model, based very closely on the actual data for the 2003 Astrophys-ical Journal .

For the ArXiv/non-ArXiv citation ratio we take the actual measured value; for the unbiased citation fre-quency distribution we take the actual citation frequency distribution. Next we randomly choose N papers, where N is the number (683) of non-ArXiv submitted papers in the sample, and we reduce the citation counts for these papers by the measured citation ratio. (We could also have increased the citation counts for the 1909 articles which represent the ArXiv submitted set, because we are only interested in the relative rank these procedures are equivalent.)
Finally we sort the modified counts and determine how many of the modeled non-ArXiv submitted pa-pers are in the top 100 and 200 most cited papers. We repeat this procedure many times, to acquire the statistical distribution.

Finally we compare the actual measured number of non-ArXiv submitted papers in the top 100 and 200 most cited papers with this expected distribution. 4. Results 4.1. The OA and EA postulates is explained by the obsolescence function (e.g. Kurtz et al., 2005b for the astronomy literature). Fig. 2 shows the P statistic for more recent material, with P ( t , 0, 0.5) on the bottom, followed by in citation rate immediately following publication (e.g. Kurtz et al., 2005b for the astronomy literature).
The most striking feature visible on these plots, the large spikes in the short time lag data shown in Fig. 2 , are not important to this discussion. They are caused by the regular publication of Trimble and Ashwan-den  X  s (e.g. 2004 and many previous) review of the literature in astrophysics published during the preceding calendar year.
Looking first at Fig. 1 we see that the various P functions are essentially flat over the 13 year period shown in the plots, trending slightly lower for the older papers. There is no feature of any kind which can be associated with the change in article access status caused by placing on-line, and without charge scanned versions of the full-text during the late 1990s. beginning in the mid 1990s and corresponding with the advent and gradual increase in popularity of the
ArXiv service. With the exception of the Trimble and Ashwanden spikes P ( t , 1, 1) is essentially flat. 4.2. The SB postulate
Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the number of non-ArXiv submitted articles in the top 200 most cited articles using the actual data for the 2003 Astrophysical Journal articles to build the model. The measured ArXiv/non-ArXiv citation ratio for these data is 2.11, there are 1909 ArXiv submitted articles and 683 non-
ArXiv submitted articles. The peak of the distribution is at 16, 16 is the number of non-ArXiv submitted articles in the top 200 most cited papers with the highest expectation value under the assumption that there is no SB effect.

The dotted line, at 6, shows the actual number of non-ArXiv submitted articles in the top 200 most cited 2003 Astrophysical Journal articles. Six or fewer articles appear in the model distribution fewer than one time in 1000; we can thus reject the hypothesis that the citation distribution of ArXiv submitted vs. non-
ArXiv submitted articles is caused by the ArXiv/non-ArXiv citation ratio (i.e. by the combined EA + OA only one non-ArXiv submitted paper, rejects this hypothesis at the 99.8% confidence level.
We thus must accept that there is some other systematic effect, correlated with citation count, which af-fects the ArXiv submitted vs. non-ArXiv submitted status of a paper. This is (without implying anything about motivations) the SB postulate. 5. Analysis
Fig. 1 shows clearly that increasing access to existing articles does not increase the probability that they will be cited. This implies that there is no significant population of astronomers who are both authors of major journal articles and who do not have  X  X  X ufficient X  X  access to the core research literature. This also implies that increasing access above a  X  X  X ufficient X  X  level has no influence on citation frequency. Because the number of downloads exceeds the number of traditional paper reads by a factor of several ( Kurtz et al., 2005b ) this suggests that there are differences in how researchers use electronic articles compared with how paper articles were used in the past. What these differences are is beyond the scope of this article.

Fig. 2 shows to what extent the ArXiv has effected the citation of very recent articles. Notice that the period. This can be understood as changing the mean effective publication date by about five or six months.
This would imply that the peak in the article age X  X itation rate diagram would be shifted toward younger articles, an effect already seen by Brody (2003) .

The results of the simulations shown in Fig. 3 indicate (at the 99.9% confidence level) that there must be some sort of selection based on article quality in determining which papers are submitted to the ArXiv, and which not. Because papers in the ArXiv are not refereed (except for a kook filter) this suggests that authors self-censor or self-promote, or that for some reason the most citable authors are also those who first use the new publication venue.

Taken together these figures suggest that, in astronomy, there is a strong EA effect and a strong SB effect; document one might expect that more people would then cite it.

We suggest that the basic reason why there seems no OA effect in astronomy is that for a person to be in the position to write an article for a core astronomy journal that person must already be in a position to read those journals, and must also be in a position to perform astronomical research. In terms of barriers to entry into the astronomical research community the second requirement is much larger than the first. Be-cause the marginal cost of being an astronomer with access to the core literature is so much lower than the cost of being an astronomer in the first place, it is reasonable to postulate that essentially all astronomers have access to the core literature through existing channels, and thus do not require an OA alternative path in order to read and cite articles.
 We believe that the claims that the citation rate ratio of papers openly available on the internet (via Ar-
Xiv or some other mechanism) vs those not available through those means is caused by the increased read-or the OA advantage) are somewhat overstated, especially for well funded disciplines with high barriers to entry. The ongoing debate concerning the desirability of Open Access literature (e.g. Amsci, 2004; Nature, ferentiation between open and non-open articles anyway.

Before open access to the core literature in astronomy could have a large effect on citation practices there would also need to be open access to the basic data of astronomical research, so as to lower the entry bar-(e.g. Brunner, Djorgovski, &amp; Szalay, 2001; Quinn &amp; Gorski, 2004 ).
