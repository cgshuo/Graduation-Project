 We examine the cold-start recommendation task in an online retail setting for users who have not yet purchased (or in-teracted in a meaningful way with) any available items but who have granted access to limited side information, such as basic demographic data (gender, age, location) or social network information (Facebook friends or page likes). We formalize neighborhood-based methods for cold-start collab-orative filtering in a generalized matrix algebra framework that does not require purchase data for target users when their side information is available. In real-data experiments with 30,000 users who purchased 80,000+ books and had 9,000,000+ Facebook friends and 6,000,000+ page likes, we show that using Facebook page likes for cold-start recom-mendation yields up to a 3-fold improvement in mean av-erage precision (mAP) and up to 6-fold improvements in Precision@k and Recall@k compared to most-popular-item, demographic, and Facebook friend cold-start recommenders. These results demonstrate the substantial predictive power of social network content, and its significant utility in a chal-lenging problem  X  recommendation for cold-start users.

The user cold-start problem concerns the task of recom-mending items to users who have not previously purchased or otherwise expressed meaningful preferences towards any items under consideration for recommendation. Addressing the cold-start problem can be important for first-time user engagement and retention and is therefore of critical signif-icance in settings such as online retail.

While traditional collaborative filtering methods [1, 6] of-ten provide strong recommendation performance once a user has made a few item purchases or preference judgments, they cannot be used in the cold-start setting when there are no user interactions with items. Content-based and user-based filtering [3] approaches may recommend solely based on user and item features in the absence of direct purchase or pref-erence information over items; however, these methods typ-ically provide very coarse approximations of content types (e.g., genre, author) and user profiles (e.g., gender, age, and location) and often only do marginally better than recom-mendation based solely on item popularity, as we show for the case of user-based demographic data in Section 4.
Recent years have seen the advent of social extensions of collaborative filtering [5] and e  X  orts to leverage rich user in-formation from Facebook and other social networks for pre-dicting users X  latent traits [2] and for recommendation [8, 10]. In the cold-start setting, Lin et al [4] leveraged social information for the item cold-start recommendation prob-lem (where an item has not been previously purchased or rated by anyone), e.g., recommending new apps by leverag-ing Twitter feedback on an app X  X  developer even though the app itself may be yet unrated.

Here, we propose to directly leverage user X  X  social network content such as Facebook friends and page likes in a novel extension of item-based collaborative filtering formalized in a generalized matrix algebra framework. This framework does not require item purchase or preference data for target users and hence addresses the user cold-start problem.
We experiment with a subset of data from Kobo Inc. that contains 30,000 users who purchased 80,000+ ebooks and had 9,000,000+ Facebook friends and liked 6,000,000+ pages. We demonstrate that using Facebook page likes for cold-start recommendation yields up to a 3-fold improve-ment in mean average precision (mAP) and up to 6-fold im-provements in Precision@k and Recall@k when compared to most-popular-item, demographic, and Facebook friend cold-
