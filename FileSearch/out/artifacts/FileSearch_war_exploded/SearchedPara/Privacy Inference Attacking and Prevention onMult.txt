 As a microdata publication model, k-anonymity aims to preventing potentially existed privacy violations (e.g., individual re-identification) beyond published microdata sets [11]. Many instances illustrating such attacks are listed in lit-erature such as [11,12,5,6,9,10,2,15]. In general, a k -anonymized microdata set requires that each record is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other records with respect to (w.r.t.) certain identifying attributes [13,1].

It is observed that privacy inference violations may exist in a k -anonymized dataset when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes [9]. The precise privacy inference attack analysis is studied in our previous paper [15] based on the privacy inference logic theory. Through further research, we observe that mul-tiple sensitive attributes together in a (or more) relational table of microdata may incur privacy inference violations, even the table is handled with proper k-anonymity techniques under the ad hoc assumption that only one sensitive attribute is contained in the table. So in this paper, we focus on the privacy dis-covery and prevention solutions against such multi-attribute privacy violations. Example for Motivation: Table 1 shows a set of medical records from a ficti-tious hospital. We divide the attributes into two groups, (Allergy, Disease) as the sensitive attributes and (BirthDate, Sex, Zipcode) as the identifying attributes.
The naive -diversity mechanism is proposed [9] to provide each value cluster of a sensitive attribute that contains at least well-represented value elements. A table with multiple sensitive attributes is -diverse if the table on any one of them is -diverse when others are all treated as identifying attributes [9]. By taking the -diversity mechanism on Table 1, we can get two anonymized tables (in Table 2 &amp; 3) that can be published since each of them is 2-diverse ( = 2 ).
According to the naive -diversity mechanism, the first table is 2-diverse on sole sensitive attribute Allergy (Disease is taken as an identifying attribute) whilethesecondoneis 2-diverse on Disease (Allergy is taken as an identifying attribute). While both of them are 2-anonymous . In each of them, there are no privacy violations that can increase the probability of individual re-identification. But if both of them are published, we can infer some useful information that are just provided by their combination. We take query-answer form to illustrate this kind of inference attacks.  X   X 
A : &lt;  X  - X  -39, F, 13053 &gt; ( inferred narrowly )  X   X 
A : &lt; 08-02-57, M, 13053 &gt; ( inferred exactly )  X   X  A : &lt; No, Polio &gt; ( inferred exactly )
The above scenario illustrates a requirement for the succeeding k-anonymity models, i.e. preventing inference violation over published microdata sets with multiple sensitive attributes. That is the main motivation of this paper work.
We observe that such kind of inference violations is caused by lacking enough relativity analysis and corresponding measures between multiple sensitive at-tributes. This is not a marginal effect on the initial dataset. In real practice, we can find many public microdata sets have relativity on identifying attributes. For instance, two microdata sets published by two hospitals have large probability to share same attribute (e.g., BirthDate, Sex, Zipcode) but different sensitive attributes. Such a situation can be simulated as a single microdata set with multiple sensitive attributes.

Consequently, we propose the ( k , ) -anonymity model towards preventing the inference violations on a microdata table with multiple sensitive attributes. The ( k , ) -anonymity process consists of two phases: 1. Phase 1: k-anonymization , which is to reach the general k-anonymity re-2. Phase 2: -diversity, which ensures the multiple sensitive attributes satisfy
Further, we propose the optimal and approximation ( k , ) -anonymity algo-rithms. They address the following three objectives: (I) avoiding inference viola-tions among multiple sensitive attributes as well as on single one; (II) guarantee-ing k-anonymity satisfied on identifying attributes and -diversity required on all sensitive attributes; and (III) making the data generalization cost for the process on identifying attributes as minimal as possible. Built based on previous work, we can easily observe that the advantages of this model will make it more robust on anti-inference and practicable in real microdata publishing applications.
The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows. We interpret some basic concepts and notations in Section 2 and discuss the theoretical foundation for multiple attribute inference analysis in Section 3 . Then, we define the data gener-alization metric and the precise and approximation ( k , ) -anonymity algorithms in Section 4 .Afterit,wecompareourmodelwi th some related work in Section 5 . Finally, we give a short conclusion in Section 6 . In this section, we introduce some basic concepts and notations for usage con-venience, as well as some preliminary con cepts for our further discussion later on.
We suppose individual data are recorded in a relational table, mainly including identifying attributes and sensitive attributes (here we ignore the unique identity A ,  X  X  X  , A m &gt; ,where A i ( 1  X  i  X  m ) is an attribute, and the value domain of A i is denoted as D i including the values that may appear in A i .Init,an attribute is named as a sensitive (information) attribute ( SI )whosevaluefor any particular individual must be kept s ecret from others. B eside, an instance We assume that each record refers to an individual, and a table instance is just a subset of some larger population  X  . Generally, we use table as the meaning of a table instance in this paper.

In a table, a set of nonsensitive attributes is called a Quasi-Identifier attribute set ( QI ), if they can be joined with external i nformation to uniquely re-identify at least one individual in  X  (with sufficiently high probability) [11,6,5]. A table T satisfies k-anonymity requirement if for every tuple t ( t  X  X  ), there exist k-1 where t [ QI i ] denotes the projection of t onto the attributes in QI i , QI i  X  X I (similar to ti j [ QI i ], 1  X  j  X  k-1 ).

A table satisfies the -diversity requirement (different from that in [9]) if any cluster mapping to a QI attributes tuple includes at least different values for all SI attributes. We say two SI attributes tuples are d ifferent if and only if on any SI attribute, their correspo nding values are different.
 Definition 1 ( K Cluster, L Cluster). In a k-anonymized table, the cluster mapping to a SI attribute tuple is called a K Cluster . The cluster mapping to a QI attribute tuple is called a L Cluster .
 For example, in Table 2, we can derive: L Cluster 1 = { &lt; Penicillin, Cancer &gt; ,  X  -39, F, 130  X  X  X  &gt; , &lt;  X  - X  -39, F, 130  X  X  X  &gt; } .

Given an attribute domain, it is possible to construct a more  X  X eneral X  do-main in a variety of ways, such as in [11,12]. We use to denote the value generalization relation. For two value v i and v j ,wetake v i v j to denote v j is 03-24-39 03- X  -39  X  - X  -39 holds on BirthDate, F  X  holds on Sex. We define the height between two values is the distance between them in a generalization hierarchy, denoted as H ( v i ,v j ). And the generalization range ( R )from v i to v , written R ( v i ,v j ), means the probability to ascertain v i according to v j ,as R (03-24-39, 03- X  -39) = 30, R ( F,  X  )=2.

Actually, it is hard to arrange generalization hierarchies with propositional generalization. For example, on (a) of Figure 1, the generalization range ( R )from B0 to B1 is about 30, denoted as R (B0, B1) = 30, which means the probability to ascertain the exact value (belong ed to B0) according to B1 is just about 1 30 , but it from B1 to B2 is 12, as R (B1, B2) = 12, where the probability is 1 12 .
It is very obvious among two generalization hierarchies, such as on BirthDate and Sex. The probability to ascertain the right sex is 1 2 , much larger than that on the BirthDate generalization hierarchy.
 Considering the example in Section 1, it is a special kind of inference violations if we can ascertain a narrower range of attributes values on Table 2 and 3 together. than any one from each single table. Such a situation can be analyzed with the Set theory and the Probability theory.
 Definition 2. An inference relation from value v i to v j holds, written as v i  X  v
Specifically, the inference probability from AF ( v )to v in the population  X  v , as P  X  v ( AF ( v )  X  v ), indicates the likelihood of correctly ascertaining v in  X  v according to AF ( v ), as: Where V  X  v ( v )= { v | v  X   X  v ,v  X  v } , V  X  v ( AF ( v )) = { v | v  X   X  v ,v  X  AF ( v ) } . Similarly, we define the inference probability within domain of v , D formula holds: Beside, it obviously holds: v AF ( v ) AF ( AF ( v )) =  X  X   X  v )  X P dicates that the more information loss on v (i.e. the less available of v ), the less possible to correctly ascertain v .

In T , we define an attribute inference relation from attribute A i to A j ,iffor is a predefined threshold value). For example, the following attribute inference relation holds obviously: BirthDate  X  Age [100%].
 Definition 3. Conditional inference relation indicates the inference probability (named conditional probability) is derived on existed relative inference relations. A multiple-attribute inference is a special kind of conditional inference relations. In a k-anonymized table with multiple attributes, it is defined as follows. Definition 4. A conditional inference relation is named multiple-attribute infer-ence if exist some base inference relations r elated with other sensitive attributes. Suppose a published k-anonymous table with QI attributes (denoted as QI = {QI of the SI set in the table.  X   X  ( SI )=  X  ( SI )-{ X  X  . Now we can formally describe the multi-attribute inference on QI attributes as follows: Suppose in tuple t ,  X   X  ,  X  ,  X  h  X   X   X  ( SI ) and the corresponding K Cluster t  X  , K
Cluster t  X  , K Cluster t  X  h on QI attributes tuples. The inference probability to there exists a common subset in K Cluster t  X  , K Cluster t  X  , K Cluster t  X  h ): is enough small. In detail, if K Cluster t  X  and K Cluster t  X  are not published, the K
Cluster t  X  h and e  X  X  X {K Cluster t  X  , K Cluster t  X  } .Insuchaview,any SI attribute is relative with other SI attributes.

The multi-attribute inference on SI attributes can be des cribe similarly to the above on QI attributes. What we need to do is to make the inference prob-ability to ascertain an element in any K Cluseter or L Cluseter enough small against multi-attribute inference after publishing the table with multiple sensi-tive attributes. A feasible approach is to make the data (for publishing) more robust against multi-attribute inference attack while satisfy k-anonymization on QI attributes and -diversity on SI attributes. This is the main idea of our ( k , ) -anonymity model.
 Definition 5. A table with multiple sensitive attributes satisfies the ( k , ) -anonymity requirement, if for each tuple t in the table, |K Cluster t | X  k , Di-verse ( L Cluster t )  X  ,where Diverse returns the diversity degree on the cluster, simply, it returns the amount of d ifferent tuples in the cluster.
 The ( k , ) -anonymity model is to implement k -anonymization on K Clusters for SI attributes while keep L Clusters for QI attributes -diverse .The Diverse measurement is on the whole SI tuple but not a single attribute, which effectively avoid multi-attribute inference violations.

From the perspective of using the servi ces on published microdata tables with ( k , ) -anonymity , k and can be seen as two thresholds for deciding whether users X  query on the table results in privacy disclosure. Still, they are not enough precise, since the different gener alization ranges may exist on QI tuples . For 13092, Stoke &gt; )= 1 30  X  12 . But the two clusters are treated same in the general k-anonymization process.

For more precise privacy violation discovery and prevention, we define the inference threshold value  X  k and  X  , which are used for judging whether querying QI attributes values w.r.t. SI attribute values and querying SI attributes values w.r.t. QI attribute values incur privacy disclosure respectively, i.e. on any tuple t , we should guarantee the following two conditions for ( k , ) -anonymization . Definition 6. In tuple t , the query on attribute tuple  X  h is anti-inference if the Suppose query on  X  h in tuple t is anti-inference , the lower bound of  X   X  h is: If query on the whole table T is anti-inference , we define the lower bounds of  X  and  X  k as: So the inference probability on  X  h in t should satisfy: where Cluster is K Cluster if  X  h  X  X I , otherwise it is L Cluster .

The ( k , ) -anonymity model need to guarantee any queries on the published ( k , ) -anonymized microdata tables (with multiple sensitive attributes) are anti-inference , which is mainly achieved by the ( k , ) -anonymity algorithm (process). In this section, we propose the precise and approximation algorithms and some necessary conditions to establish the ( k , ) -anonymity model. Both two algo-rithms are based on the anonymization cost notion. It is relative with the gen-eralization range .

For example, the cost on 13053 + 130  X  X  X  for Zipcode generalization is much more than that on F  X  for Sex generalization. Another it is relative with the generalization height , as the cost on 13053 + 130  X  X  X  is more than that on 13053 + 1305  X  for Zipcode generalization, since the ratio of the height on the former to the whole height is 2 5 , but the ratio is 1 5 on the latter.

Suppose the cluster size is sz , each tuple element in the cluster contains m archy for attribute A i . The corresponding attribute values in the derived cluster satisfying k -anonymization is denoted as A i ( i =1,  X  X  X  , m ), which is the general-follows: where factor c j i is used to balance the influence of height and range on the result.
We should note that the cost simply based on the amount of  X  in the derived table is not enough meaningful (it is often used in many algorithms, such as in [2,3], discussed more in our paper [7]), since this calculation cannot present the real generalization degree and the effect after generalization.
 13054 &gt; ) are equivalent according to the simple calculation on the amount of  X  . But in effect, the exact attribute value tuple can be inferred with 1 2 prob-ability, which is larger than that on the latter, which is 1 10 . If we just require 2-anonymization , then the latter is over-generalized.

Overall, the main idea of two algorithms is make the whole cost of all K Clusters as small as possible while guarantee the corresponding L Clusters are -diverse . To achieve this goal, we adopt the graph representation method in the algorithm (similar to the algorithm in [2] but ours satisfy the -diversity requirement for each cluster). The graph representation method takes each tuple in the table as a node in the graph. We define the weight on each edge between two nodes as the S value evaluated on the two tuples X  QI attributes. Beside, we denote n as the amount of clusters in the graph.

Based on the graph representation, we can calculate the temporal complexity of the precise algorithm for the optimal ( k , ) -anonymity solution is O ( C n  X  ( n ) ), where C n denote the combination amount of choosing numbers from n numbers.
 We can briefly describe the algorithm for this optimal solution.
 1. Building the completely equivalent set w.r.t. all SI attributes, suppose there 2. From these n clusters, choose k -clusters combination, and pick up just one 3. From the combination, choose the cluster set covering the whole table with
To improve the efficiency, we propose an approximation algorithm. The process of this algorithm is (1) establish a graph with n nodes; (2) get all K Clusters with at least totally different values on all SI attributes and the whole S on the graph is as small as possible.

It should be noted that the necessary conditions for successfully running this algorithm to build the ( k , ) -anonymity model are: (1) k  X  ;and(2) Diverse ( &lt; SI 1 , SI 2 ,  X  X  X  , SI m 2 &gt; )  X  ( m2 = |SI| ). A sufficient condition is that exist n -diverse clusters on SI tuples.
Simply, we just publish one table derived from the initial table, which includes all SI attributes as the maximal combination. To prevent the multi-attribute inference, the algorithm guarantees there are at least completely diverse SI attributes elements in any L Cluster . It is also very convenient to extend this algorithm for multiple tables publishing. What only need to do is to guarantee at least elements co-existed in all L Clusters for different SI attributes or com-binations mapping to the same QI tuple, at the same time, make the inference probability on QI attributes less than the corresponding threshold. [
Proof of Complete ness and Soundness ] As this algorithm is on the graph representation, which is discussed in [2], as well as its completeness and sound-ness. Beside, similarly to the algorithm in [2], the temporal complexity of this algorithm is O ( k n 2 ). Further, it can be easily revised to implement more com-prehensive mechanisms, such as Entropy -diversity in [9].
Suppose all factors c j i ( j =1,  X  X  X  ,7, i =1,2,3) are 1 in default, the cost S on any edge in the graph can be calculated, as illustrated in Table 4, where the right-upper data items are the result cal culated according to Formula (11), the left-lower data items are the result simply considering the amount of  X  .From Table 4, we can also observe that the S metric method is more precise than the previous one (i.e. the amount of  X  [2,3]).

Then we can build the optimal ( 2 , 2 ) -anonymized table (in Table 5) and the approximation ( 2 , 2 ) -anonymized table (in Table 6) according to the precise and approximation algorithms respectively.

Instead of simple data suppression, k -anonymity is proposed for more usage convenience.

It is proven that the k-anonymity problem is NP -hard even when the at-tribute values are ternary [10,2,1]. An algorithm with O ( k )-approximation is proposed for this problem [2]. Individual-specific k mechanism is discussed in [8], which is an improvement of the current table-level k mechanism. Violation of k -anonymity occurs when a particular a ttribute value of an entity can be de-termined to be among less than k possibilities by using the views together with the schema information of the private table [14]. It is proven that whether a set of views occur privacy disclosure for k-anonymity is also a computationally hard problem [14]. Formal research on data utility is studied in [4], towards increas-ing the utility through injecting additional information on k-anonymized data. Through observation on the original dataset, [3] gives a way to clustering records more useful information, through deletin g or non-releasing so me records (using a fraction). The approach to precisely measure the privacy inference violations based on probability theory is discussed in our previous paper [15].
 The -diversity [9] mechanism is the work on how to prevent the inference on SI attributes values when the corresponding QI attributes values are known. Its main work just focus on single sensitive attribute. In many situations, multiple sensitive attributes are always existed in the same table. So our ( k , ) -anonymity model and the algorithms are motivated to solve such a kind of challenges, with advantages to some extent over the work in [9]. Further, our algorithm is based on graph representation, which is similar to the mechanism in [2], in which, the algorithm to implement k-anonymity is also based on graph. In [2], the algorithm needs O ( kn 2 ). In our algorithm, the components are directly accomplished by the aggregation iteration process from 2 to k while guarantee the corresponding L Clusters are -diverse after iteration. The complexity of the whole process is O ( kn 2 ). Beside, as above discussed, the mean complexity of our precise algorithm is
O ( C easy to find the optimal solution for data publishing with the equivalent time cost comparing with the approximation algorithm and even others.

From the above discussion, we can conclude that they are three privacy attacks that can be prevented by our model, which can be describe as follows (1) Inferring QI attributes when single SI are known; (2) Inferring SI attributes when QI are known; (3) Inferring QI attributes when multiple SI (in one or several tables) are known. As we know, the ( k , ) -anonymity model is the first study on inference prevention among multiple sensitive attributes for privacy protection in microdata publication. In conclusion, the primary work in the paper is the ( k , ) -anonymity model. It consists of two processes: k -anonymization on QI attributes and -diversity on SI attributes. With the algorithm, we explicitly achieve the -diversity char-acteristic while implicitly capture k -anonymization on QI attributes. Overall, the advantages of our ( k , ) -anonymity model include: (1) It is available for more general dataset publishing, especially when the dataset contains multiple sensitive attributes that should be protected against inference; (2) It supports multi-attribute inference violation prevention, which is not achieved yet by pre-vious related techniques; (3) The cost metric on data generalization is more reasonable comparing to some existed measurements.

In future, we will continue study the m odel on more efficient algorithms sup-porting more individuals X  flexibility, as our preliminary research in [8].
