 1. Introduction
Search tactics represent the key and fundamental level of search activities during the information searching process. A search tactic is considered a basic unit of analysis of the information searching process. A search tactic refers to a move or moves, including search choices and actions that users apply to achieve a specific objective in the information searching process. The main difference between a search tactic and a search behavior is that a search tactic might contain a series of search behaviors and these search behaviors are part of a search tactic applied to accomplish a specific objective. Research concerning search tactics has been conducted mainly in two ways: identification of search tactics and analysis of search tac-environment shows more dynamic interactions between users and IR systems than in traditional searching environments. In web IR systems, users usually apply various types of search tactics such as searching known addresses, opening multiple tabs, moving forward and backward through hyperlinks, query formulation and reformulation, scanning search results, and saving documents ( Aula, Jhaveri, &amp; Kaki, 2005; Bhavnani, 2001; Thatcher, 2006; Wang, Hawk, &amp; Tenopir, 2000 ).
Previous studies in search tactic research have focused more on tactics, themselves, or tactic patterns, but few have tried to examine the effects of various factors that can influence the application of search tactics, such as task types, user X  X  per-ceived knowledge levels, search processes, and system types. According to previous research, work tasks influence search activities and search performance ( Bystr X m &amp; J X rvelin, 1995; Bystr X m, 2002 ), while search tasks affect search tactics ( Kim &amp; Allen, 2002; Shiri &amp; Revie, 2003 ). Users X  perceived knowledge, including search experience and domain knowledge, and their interactions have an impact on their search behaviors ( Aula, 2003; Hsieh-Yee, 1998; Lazonder, Biemans, &amp; Wopereis, 2000; Palmquist &amp; Kim, 2000; Wildemuth, 2004 ). Users also exhibit different behaviors, including tactics at different stages  X  and phases of the search process ( Kuhlthau, 1991; Vakkari, 2001; Vakkari, Pennanen, &amp; Serola, 2003 ). In addition, different types of IR systems create different search contexts that lead to the application of simple or complicated query-related and other search tactics ( Jansen &amp; Pooch, 2001; Wolfram &amp; Xie, 2002; Xie, 2004 ).

Previous research has explored factors in relation to search behaviors; however, most of the research only focused on one or two factors. More importantly, few studies have investigated multiple search tactics beyond query-related tactics, and few of them applied both quantitative and qualitative methods into the data collection and analysis. This study intends to inves-tigate the effects of different factors in relation to tasks, users X  perceived knowledge, search processes, and systems on users X  search tactic selection. Findings are based on the analysis of real users X  searching processes in achieving their real tasks. The findings of this study could help researchers better understand how users develop their search tactics under the influence of various factors in different web-based information environments. Also, the investigation of different factors in relation to tactic selection could offer practical implications for IR system design to support users X  multiple search tactic application in their search processes. 2. Literature review
In this literature review section, previous studies that identified and examined factors associated with search tactics are reviewed in relation to task types, users X  perceived knowledge levels, search processes, and system types. 2.1. Task types
Task is a key factor that influences search behaviors, including search tactics ( Vakkari, 2003 ). Different types of tasks have been identified and classified in the Web search environment ( Li, 2009; Xie, 2009 ), and both work tasks and search tasks have an impact on search behaviors. Xie (2009) identified dimensions of work task (nature, stages, and time frame) and search task (origination, types, and flexibility), and found that information-seeking processes, such as planning, search strat-egy selection, and shifts in goals, varied in different work and search tasks. Bystr X m and J X rvelin (1995) identified five dif-ferent complexity-level tasks from automatic information processing to genuine decision and discovered that the types of information sought varied in different task complexity levels. Bystr X m (2002) further examined the relationships between perceived task complexity and information-seeking activities, focusing on a need for and consequent use of information sources. Her findings reported that task complexity has a direct relationship with source uses; for example, internal official documents are most used in automatic information processing tasks, while human sources are the most used in decision tasks. In her experimental study with 24 participants, Li (2010) found that work tasks dramatically affect users X  interaction performance, in particular, search efficiency and effectiveness. In her results, search efficiency and effectiveness were higher in less complex decision tasks, whereas they were lower in more complex intellectual tasks.

Compared with work tasks, search tasks are found to be more associated with search tactics and moves. Hsieh-Yee (1998) identified three groups of Web user search tactics: tactics for starting, tactics for too many item retrieved, and tactics for no relevant items retrieved; she then compared the patterns of tactics in two different search tasks: known-item searches and subject searches. She found there were no significant differences of search tactics used for these two types of search tasks.
Kim and Allen (2002) examined the effect of two search tasks, including known-item searching and subject searching, on and search tool uses, was confirmed as significant statistically. Shiri and Revie (2003) evaluated the effects of search topic complexity on cognitive and physical search moves within the interface of a thesaurus-enhanced information retrieval envi-ronment. Their findings indicated that an increased number of cognitive and physical search moves were associated with more complex topics. In her experimental study, Hung (2005) empirically examined how users X  selections of search tactics differ by search task type, specific search, general search, and subjective search. Users employed more complex search tactics in general or subjective search tasks than in specific search tasks. Liu, Gwizdka, Liu, Xu, and Belkin (2010) investigated how task type and task situation influence users X  query reformulation behavior, based on an experimental study with 48 partic-ipants. Their results showed that three types of task structures, including simple, hierarchical, and parallel searches, are asso-ciated with participants X  query reformulations. While specialization reformulation strategies were most frequently applied in simple and hierarchical searches, generalization strategies were most applied in hierarchical searches. Search tasks not only affect adults X  but also children X  X  search tactics application. According to Bilal and Kirby (2002) , children used more nat-ural language queries and looped and backtracked more searches on fact-based tasks, and browsed more on self-generated tasks. They also applied more analytic searches on these two tasks than on research tasks. 2.2. Users X  perceived knowledge level
Users X  perceived knowledge levels have long been investigated for their relationships to information search behaviors, including tactics and strategies. Researchers examined the effects of different types of users X  perceived knowledge, in par-ticular, search experience and domain knowledge.

Level of search experience has been demonstrated to lead to different search behaviors, for example, users X  preference for specific features of the system ( Hill &amp; Hannafin, 1997 ) and the increased likelihood that inexperienced users will use hyperlinks ( Palmquist &amp; Kim, 2000 ). Information retrieval knowledge is also related to search behaviors. For example, the most experienced groups perform the most cost-effective searches ( Howard, 1982 ), and there are differences between novice addition, based on examining 25 students X  search processes, Lazonder et al. (2000) found that expert users are usually better at searching, but not at browsing, than novice users.

Simultaneously, prior studies have shown that domain knowledge has an impact on search tactics. Hsieh-Yee (1993) investigated domain knowledge X  X  impact on search tactics for both novice and experienced users, and she found that domain knowledge affected search tactic selection of experienced users. Wildemuth (2004) concluded that the effects of domain knowledge on search tactic formulation changed over time as participants X  domain knowledge changed. Hembrooke, Granka,
Gay, and Liddy (2005) examined the effects of domain knowledge on query-related tactics such as query creation and mod-ification tactics, and their results revealed that expert users apply more elaboration and more complex queries whereas nov-ices engage in less effective search strategies, such as plural making/taking, redundancy, poke and hope, and backtracking.
Shiri and Revie (2003) investigated how topic familiarity and prior topic search experience influence users X  cognitive and physical moves in IR systems. Their findings indicated that users searching moderately familiar and very familiar topics used more moves than users searching for unfamiliar topics; however, prior topic search experience was found not to affect the number of cognitive or physical moves.

Interestingly, not all studies reach an agreement on the influence of domain knowledge. According to Aula (2003) , domain expertise did not have an effect on the query formulation, but the level of experience in using Web was related to query for-mulation behaviors. Hsieh-Yee (1993) found that search experience affects searchers X  search tactics, but, at the same time, she pointed out that domain knowledge could be a factor after searchers have gained a certain amount of search experience. 2.3. Search process/system types
In addition to tasks and users X  knowledge levels, search process is another important factor that is associated with search tactics. Users exhibit search behaviors or tactics at different stages or phases of the search process. In this paper, the differ-ence between phases and stages lies with the fact that phases are associated with a single search session, while stages are associated with multiple search sessions, although researchers have used different terms to represent these two concepts. In her information search process (ISP) theory, Kuhlthau (1991) identified six stages and showed the changes in users X  physical actions, cognitive thoughts, and affective feelings in each stage. The ISP theory presents how users search behaviors change as the search stage changes. Vakkari and his associates ( Vakkari, 2001; Vakkari et al., 2003 ) integrated Kuhlthau X  X  six stages into a three-stage model, including pre-focus, formulation, and post-focus, and found that users changed their search tactics corresponding to their changes of stages. In particular, as users moved forward through stages, they increased their use of search formulation tactics (e.g., intersect, vary, and parallel) and application of conceptual search tactics, and decreased the employment of operational tactics. These results are validated and specified in another study of users X  changing of search tactics in an academic setting, in which Xie (2009) found that stages of tasks play a crucial role in influencing users X  appli-cation of information-seeking strategies. While users focused on exploring different topics at the pre-focus stage, at the for-mation stage, they concentrated more on how to formulate the query to represent their topics. During the post-focus stage, they applied the pearl-growing strategies, checked with human resources about their search results from the formation stage, as well as searched for different formats of documents.

Researchers investigate phases of the search process as well as the different search stages. Robins (2000) focused on the processes of shifts of search foci in mediated IR interaction via discourse analysis. Six foci were highlighted in terms of doc-uments, evaluation of search results, search strategies, IR system, topic of the search, and information about the user; how-ever, his research did not find patterns among the transition in foci. On the contrary, Olah (2005) pointed out that there were specific search patterns identified, especially iterative loops and linear moves corresponding to the 14 states of the process: database selection, review result set, and the physical delivery of result set. Kules and Shneiderman (2008) uncovered that users are likely to explore as they are more organized in a search process. Additionally, Liu and Belkin (2010) identified task stage as one of the factors related to search behaviors when performing three assigned search tasks in different stages.
Users X  search tactics and strategies vary in different types of systems. Different types of Web systems, such as OPAC, on-line databases, and web search engines, have different interfaces and document collections. Wolfram and Xie (2002) char-acterized two IR contexts in terms of content, usage behaviors, and accessibility. While the traditional IR context is related to online databases, a popular IR context is associated with Web search engines. These two contexts present different search behaviors by their users. Jansen and Pooch (2001) compared users X  different search behaviors, such as number of queries, search length, and use of advanced features, in traditional IR, OPAC, and Web contexts, focusing on query searches based on literature reviews. Web users exhibit different search behaviors compared to users searching traditional IR systems such as online databases. For example, web search engine users are likely to create shorter queries, modify fewer queries, and examine only top ranked pages compared to traditional information system users ( Silverstein, Henzinger, Marais, &amp; Moricz, 1999; Spink, Wolfram, Jansen, &amp; Saracevic, 2001 ). After comparing users X  use and evaluation of online databases and Web search engines, Xie (2004) found that online databases enable users to construct and modify their complicated queries and other search features while Web search engines lead users to come up with simple queries.

Prior studies identified different factors and investigated the effect of those factors on users X  search behaviors. These stud-ies have greatly contributed to the understanding of how users select search tactics in their search processes. In spite of these contributions, however, the existing research has some limitations. First, little research has examined different factors re-lated to search tactics in multiple dimensions. Most prior works have concerned a specific aspect among task type, user knowledge, search process, and system types. Second, few studies have covered multiple search tactics in examining the re-lated factors. Most studies focused only on query-related search tactics, even though exploration and evaluation tactics are also critical. Third, limited numbers of studies applied both quantitative methods, including inferential statistics and qual-itative methods, in their studies. Fourth, many previous studies relied on experimental designs with assigned tasks, as op-posed to real users with real tasks. Fifth, there is little research that investigates the association between system types and selection from tasks, users X  perceived knowledge, search process, and system types by applying both quantitative and qual-itative methods. 3. Research questions and associated hypotheses
This study intends to investigate the factors in relation to search tactic selection, and address the following research ques-tions and associated research hypotheses: R(Q1) Is there a relationship between types of tasks and search tactic selection? If yes, how? R(Q2) Is there a relationship between user characteristics and search tactic selection? If yes, how? R(Q3) Is there a relationship between search process and search tactic selection? If yes, how? R(Q4) Is there a relationship between system types and search tactic selection? If yes, how? 4. Methodology 4.1. Sampling
To test the proposed hypotheses, the authors recruited 31 participants from the Greater Milwaukee area responding to fliers or newspaper advertisements. They represent general users with different sex, race, ethnic backgrounds, education and literacy levels, computer skills, occupations, and other demographic characteristics. We selected only the characteristics that affect the selection of search tactics identified by previous literature and the authors X  own works to test the associations. The fliers and newspaper advertisement looked for users of the World Wide Web for business, pleasure, or other reasons. Potential participants were 18 years or older who live in the Milwaukee area and had some online searching experience.
In addition, the incentive and the instructions in relation to how to participate in the study were also mentioned. Participants were each paid $75 for their involvement in the study. Table 1 presents participant characteristics.
 4.2. Data collection and procedures
First, participants were instructed to fill in a pre-questionnaire requesting their demographic information and their expe-rience in searching for information. From the pre-questionnaire, data in relation to search task type, work task type, famil-iarity with topic, and familiarity with source were collected. Second, participants were asked to keep an  X  X  X nformation interaction diary X  X  for 2 weeks to record the process of achieving one work-related and another personal-related task. The diaries require participants to log their source selections, search tactics, and reasons associated with why they applied or did not apply different types of search tactics. From the diaries, the authors attempted to identify factors behind their selec-tion of search tactics qualitatively. Third, think aloud protocols and logs were employed to record their search processes and associated verbal protocols. Participants were invited to come to the lab to search for information for one work-related and one personal search tasks. They were instructed to  X  X  X hink aloud X  X  during their information-seeking process. Their search pro-cesses were captured by Morae, a usability testing software that records users X  movements, as well as capturing their  X  X  X hink aloud protocols. X  X  Finally, participants were also asked to fill in post-questionnaires. Their answers regarding their selection of information sources, their search tactics, their problems, and factors affecting their selection of search tactics were noted. 4.3. Data analysis
The study considered eight main factors and statistically tested whether there are relationships between these factors and search tactic selection. Dimensions, types, definitions, and categories under each type of factor are presented in Table 2 .In this paper, dimensions refer to different aspects that influence search tactic selection, and each dimension has its own factors.

The unit of analysis in this study is each search tactic. Search tactics were coded using a scheme developed mainly by Xie (2008) , consisting of 13 types of tactics. For this study, the classification scheme was slightly modified.  X  X  X ccessing X  X  was di-vided into two different tactics,  X  X  X ccessing forward X  X  and  X  X  X ccessing backward, X  X  considering that the direction of accessing has different meanings in the search process.  X  X  X valuating X  X  was further divided into  X  X  X valuating search results X  X  and  X  X  X valu-ating an individual item, X  X  because the authors found that evaluating behaviors differed by participants under different cir-cumstances. For instance, when participants looked at a list of search results, they were likely to assess quickly to select an item, whereas when they faced each individual document, they usually made more of an effort to judge its relevance. Thus we created  X  X  X valuating search results X  X  and  X  X  X valuating an individual item X  X  categories to code quick judgments and thorough assessments, respectively. For simplicity, each tactic has been represented by an acronym, and an italic font was applied to the acronym. Table 3 presents the coding scheme of types of search tactics.

To test the inter-coder reliability of each search tactic, two researchers independently coded 20 tasks from 10 participants randomly selected from 60 tasks performed by 31 participants. The inter-coder reliability for coding each search tactic was .97 according to Holsti X  X  (1969) reliability formula. Reliability = 2 M /( N 1+ N 2), where M is the number of coding decisions on which two coders agree, and N 1 and N 2 refer to the total number of coding decisions by the first and second coder, respectively.

A total of 3756 tactics were observed in 60 search tasks performed by 31 participants. The findings of frequency and pro-portions of applied types search tactics can be found in another paper. Major tactics refer to frequently applied tactics such ysis, 60 search sessions were analyzed using categories identified in Table 2 above. In order to ensure the reliability of data coding, one researcher first examined each individual search session with its think-aloud protocols and identified and as-signed different types of factors and categories under each type of factor, and then another researcher analyzed and checked whether the assignment was appropriate. If there were disagreements, the two researchers worked together to reach an agreement. Then, the authors established eight hypotheses to examine the relationships between identified factors and search tactic selection statistically.

In order to investigate whether search session length is associated with tactic selection, the authors grouped 60 cases into four categories based on search session length. As shown in Fig. 1 , four groups of search length were identified  X  short search, medium-short search, medium-long search, and long search  X  based on the three elbows observed in the distribution. Short searches took less than 11 min 15 s. Medium-short searches took between 12 min 30 s and 20 min 35 s. Medium-long search took between 23 min 45 s and 33 min 45 s. Long search cases took 35 min or more.

To have an understanding of how tactic selection differs by search phases, the authors divided a search session into begin-ning, middle, and ending phases. Since the average number of tactics applied in one search session in the dataset was about 60, about six tactics, which account for approximately 10% of tactics in a single session, were considered to be appropriate to identify beginning and ending phases in this study. The authors also examined the search sessions that consist of less or (query initiation strategy and known item exploration strategy) and ending phases (results evaluation strategy and explo-ration strategy) did not change over the length of the search sessions. The rest of the tactics were considered to be middle phases. Fifty-three of the sixty cases that contained at least 24 tactics were analyzed, because the middle phases should con-tain the same or more search tactics than the sum of beginning and ending phases.

Using the information of classified factors and search tactic frequency, the authors conducted eight cross-tabulation anal-yses and examined the significance of association for each analysis using Chi-square tests, since the data concerns the fre-quency of applied tactics. When the association turned out to be significant, the authors tried to identify unique patterns. In addition, qualitative analyses were conducted to identify the reasons behind the observed search tactic selection patterns.
Using the data from think-aloud protocols and diaries, the patterns and reasons related to observed tactic selection were explained in detail. 5. Results
This section reports the results of the proposed research questions and corresponding hypotheses. While transaction logs offer data in relation to application of search tactics, system type, and length of search sessions, the pre-questionnaires pro-order to investigate the associations between these factors and tactic selection, the authors conducted cross-tabulation anal-ysis with Chi-square tests. As the observed counts of two less frequently used tactics, Lrn and Mon , were too small to be in-cluded in Chi-square test, those two tactics were excluded from the statistical analysis. Since the frequency of search tactics of the dependent variable is distributed into 11 categories, the percentage of difference among categories of each indepen-dent variable for each category of dependent variable appears low in the dataset. Moreover, there are fewer frequencies of minor tactic occurrences in this dataset. Therefore, the authors focused only on the differences among different categories that were about 3% or more for major tactics and 1% or more for minor tactics when interpreting empirical findings. Some of the small differences were discussed only if qualitative data shed some light on them. In addition, qualitative data derived from verbal protocols and diaries were used to offer patterns and reasons behind the selection of search tactics. The results are organized by dimensions of factors: task type, user perceived-knowledge level, search process, and system types. 5.1. Task type and tactic selection 5.1.1. Work task types and tactic selection The authors identified three work task types based on the categories: scholarly task, occupational task, and popular task.
The numbers of tactics applied in each task were 723, 1277, and 1735, respectively. Table 4 presents cross-tabulation of work task type and tactic selection. A Chi-square test rejected the null hypothesis, indicating the significant association between work task types and tactic selection: v 2 (20, N = 3735) = 96.856, p &lt; .01.

In achieving scholarly work tasks, the participants exhibited unique tactic selection patterns. Scholarly task relied more on search result evaluation tactics, EvalR . The percentage of EvalR (14.5%) was relatively higher in accomplishing this type of task than other types of work tasks. This finding implied that participants more frequently applied search result evaluation tactics for scholarly search tasks. Also, the proportions of Org (3.2%) and Mod (4.1) tactics were comparatively higher in per-forming scholarly tasks than in performing other types of tasks. For instance, a participant applied Org tactics to classify search results in a scholarly search task. She said:  X  X  X  sorted the information into Positive Health Effects, Negative Health Effects, Physiological Mechanism and Other to better organize my results ( Org ). X  X  As to occupational tasks, the percentage of Xplor was relatively higher compared to scholarly tasks, accounting for 11.6%.
However, the percentage of EvalR was relatively lower, 10.0%. In the data, the authors observed that the participants fre-quently browsed lists, such as a list of companies, products, and item prices, to achieve their given work tasks. For example, a participant described a browsing activity while carrying out a work-related task:  X  X  X ith the information (a list of firm names) ... I will be working next on browsing the companies X  websites to determine which 2 or 3 may be most useful to our needs. X  X 
The results also showed the pattern of tactic selection related to popular work tasks. Participants applied relatively higher percentage of AccF (28.6%) in performing popular work tasks than scholarly tasks. Simultaneously, participants employed high percentage of Xplor tactic (10.6%). These findings indicate participants were likely to go through different items through hyperlinks to accomplish popular tasks. In addition, the percentage of the Mod tactic was relatively lower compared to schol-arly tasks, showing only 1.9%. This means participants conducted less formal searches in achieving popular work tasks. The diary data offered some explanations for the tactic selection. For instance, a participant provided a typical reason for not applying Org or Mod in searching for popular tasks:  X  X  X  did not organize my results because I wanted to just read through them freely X  X ;  X  X  X his was an informal search. I didn X  X  have a specific process I was following. X  X 
In addition, the authors found that the participants were likely to apply more specific tactics for certain search topics of popular tasks. Particularly, in performing shopping tasks, participants were more likely to apply site comparison strategy, in which participants explore different sites with similar characteristics. Accordingly, Xplor tactics were applied frequently.
Here is one example that shows successive exploration:  X  X  X  went to BestBuy.com ... ; I went to Circuitcity.com ... ; I went to walmart.com ... ; I went to target.com (successive Xplor  X  X ). X  X 
In analyzing the results, the authors found that participants selected different types of IR systems for different types of work tasks. One interpretation of the results can be that there are interactions between types of tasks and types of IR sys-tems. Since types of work tasks led participants to select different types of IR systems, types of IR systems could determine the selection of search tactics. The authors conducted a Chi-square test to analyze the relationships between types of tasks and types of IR system selection. The Chi-square test result indicates a significant relationship between these two factors: v 2 = 67.21 ( df = 6), p &lt; .01.

In the dataset, participants showed different patterns of resource uses by work task type. Participants used search engines for popular tasks (47.1%) more frequently than they used them for occupational (38.1%) or scholarly (44.5%) tasks. Partici-pants used Web pages for occupational tasks (64%) more frequently than they used them for popular (51.6%) or scholarly (44.5%) tasks. Participants used OPAC and online databases for scholarly tasks (4.4% and 6.6%, respectively) more frequently than they used them for popular tasks (1.2% OPAC; 0% online database) or occupational tasks (0.4% OPAC; 0% online database).

In addition, search logs of participants also shed some light on the interactions. In performing scholarly tasks, the IR sys-tems (e.g., online databases) they chose offered more system features to support search result evaluation and organization selected PubMed for his searches. In this case, he mostly applied keyword search, organized, and evaluated search results iteratively (EvalR) in PubMed until getting enough useful literature for his research work. Online databases, which are usu-ally selected in accomplishing scholarly tasks, well support more query searching and search result evaluation along with search result organization options. Participants employed Web search engines and Web pages more frequently in searching for popular tasks such as travel, shopping, and entertainment. For example, one participant who tried to look for some new running shoes started with Google, and checked and compared several commercial websites of retailers based on the search results and his own identified web sites. As this example shows, popular tasks are usually achieved by web search engines and/or web sites. None of the participants used an online database for popular tasks. 5.1.2. Search task types and tactic selection
In the dataset, three kinds of search task types are identified  X  subject-oriented search, specific information search, and known-item search. The number of tactics applied in subject-oriented searches, specific information searches, and known-item searches turned out to be 2105, 1427, and 203, respectively. Table 5 shows the cross-tabulation of search task type and tactic selection. A Chi-square analysis rejected the null hypothesis. The findings show that there is a significant relationship between search task type and tactic selection: v 2 (20, N = 3735) = 51.589, p &lt; 0.01.

Subject-oriented search tasks contain relatively higher ratios of EvalR (12.2%) and AccB (12.1%) tactics, which are related to the iterative search result evaluation strategy. The Iterative search result evaluation strategy represents users X  repeated iterative search result evaluation strategy in accomplishing subject-oriented search tasks. For example, a participant who wanted to search prehistoric cave art repeated evaluating search results to find some related items:  X  X  ... creates a query: pre-historic cave art ... ? ... evaluates search results ? clicks and accesses 3rd result (The dawn of prehistoric rock art by James
Q. Jacobs) ? ... accesses back to Google search results and evaluates them again ... ? clicks 2nd result (Prehistoric art by history link 101) ? ...  X  X  In fulfilling specific search tasks, even though the EvalI tactic was applied the most proportionally (22.6%), the difference is small among three types of tasks in EvalI tactic application. However, the nature of the task requires participants to evaluate individual items to find the answers. For instance, a participant who searched for two ski hills con-ditions in Wisconsin visited several related websites and evaluated whether each site provided needed information:  X  X  X h this conditions ...  X  X ,  X  X  X k, that gives me what I would need. X  X  More data are needed for further investigation. Known-item search tasks involved higher proportions of Creat and Mod tactics, 6.4% and 4.4% relatively. This indicates that participants were likely to find the targeted item relying on query creation and reformulation. In the think-aloud protocol and log data, a par-ticipant searching for the proceedings of Cook County Commissioners relied on creating and modifications of search queries at an OPAC system:  X  X  ... ? accesses Newberry Library OPAC ? (query) cook county board of commissioners ? ... ? my search seems to have disappeared ? ... ? (query reformulation) removes  X  X ommissioner X  from query and searches catalog ...  X  X  5.2. User perceived-knowledge level and tactic selection 5.2.1. Familiarity with search topic and tactic selection
The first user characteristic tested was familiarity with search topic. Familiarity with search topic was measured by a five-point scale from  X  X  X ot at all X  X  to  X  X  X xtremely. X  X  Table 6 shows cross-tabulation of familiarity with topic and tactic selection. A
Chi-square test rejected the null hypothesis and proved a significant association between familiarity with search topic and egories (1 X 5 scale) and tactic selection exhibits curvilinear pattern, so the authors regrouped the five categories into three ticipants might not be able to accurately claim their familiarity level.

It was observed that different search tactic patterns corresponded to levels of familiarity with certain search topics. The  X  X  X amiliar group X  X  applied more percentage of EvalR (12.2%) compared with other groups. This shows that the participants of this group engaged in more EvalR because their previous knowledge on the topic enabled them to make judgments based on the information provided by the result list. The following shows how a participant of the  X  X  X amiliar group X  X  evaluated search results efficiently based on her previous knowledge.  X  X  X  looked through the Google results and assessed them according to what I needed (i.e., discarded anything that looked commercial and irrelevant) ...  X  X 
Conversely, the participants of the group  X  X  X ot familiar X  X  with the search topic applied relatively higher percentage of query-related tactics such as Creat (4.5%) compared to the familiar group. One interesting finding is that participants unfa-miliar with the topic were likely to use multiple IR systems and create queries for each system. For instance, in the dataset, one participant wanted to know how to remove arsenic from marshlands in Kewaunee, WI using sugar, but was unfamiliar with the topic. He tried search engines (e.g., Google), online database (e.g., ASCE X  X  civil engineering database), Webpages (e.g., epa.gov), and OPAC (e.g., UWM library PantherCat). He created a query in using each of these IR systems. 5.2.2. Familiarity with resources and tactic selection
The relationship between familiarity with resources and search tactic selection was also tested. Since the frequency of cross-tabulation of familiarity with source and tactic selection. The result of Chi-square test accepted the null hypothesis,
The result shows that participants preferred to use information sources that they are familiar with. Here is a typical exam-ple:  X  X  X  know that the University of Wisconsin Madison has a great study abroad resource website with all the information needed on every study abroad program available to students, so I selected it. X  X  The proportions (80%) of  X  X  X omewhat more (38.3%) X  X  and  X  X  X xtremely (41.7%) X  X  were much higher than the others. Even though type of resources is associated with the selection of search tactics, familiarity with source was not significantly related to tactic selection, because participants in general selected sources that they were familiar with. 5.2.3. Search skills and tactic selection
The relationship between search skills and tactic selection was also examined. Using pre-questionnaire, levels of search skills of participants were considered as a variable in this study. Table 8 shows cross-tabulation of search skills and tactic selection. A Chi-square test rejected the null hypothesis and proved a signification association between search skills and tac-tic selection: v 2 (20, N = 3735) = 66.295, p &lt; .01.

The expert group exhibits unique tactic selection patterns. Most notably, the expert group applied more EvalR tactics (17.1%) and AccB (11.5%), but fewer Xplor tactics (6.2%), which indicates that they relied more on search result evaluation strategy than browsing in using the Web. This reaffirms the findings of previous research that expert users prefer searching to browsing ( Palmquist &amp; Kim, 2000; Lazonder et al., 2000 ). Moreover, the authors observed that expert participants were more willing to use advanced search functions. The following example shows how an expert participant used the advanced search function effectively in his search process:  X  X  X he homepage has a prominent section  X  X awyer Locator X  ... I chose the
Advanced Search to refine area of law desired &amp; a few other pieces of necessary data ... The first search netted 146 hits. I refined this further by  X  X rea of practice X  to reduce it to 24 ... From there I could also limit it to firms in or near Milwaukee,
WI. X  X  Also, it turned out that the expert group is more likely to use some minor tactics, such as Org (2.8%). Conversely, the intermediate group shows lower usage of EvalR tactics (9.7%) compared to the other groups. 5.3. Search process 5.3.1. Search session length and tactic selection
The authors grouped 60 cases into four categories based on search session length as shown in Fig. 1 to test whether there is association between search session length and tactic selection. Table 9 presents four groups of cases by time length. Table 10 shows the cross-tabulation between time length and tactic selection. Null hypothesis was rejected based on a
Chi-square test. A significant association between time length and tactic selection was identified: v
N = 3735) = 61.975, p &lt; 0.01. Each of the four groups presents a unique pattern of tactic selection. Following examples show typical patterns of short search, medium search, and long search, respectively.

First, short searches showed relatively higher percentage of Creat (4.3%) compared to long searches, but the least of Mod (1.4%) compared to medium-long and long searches. This indicates that participants created initial queries in performing short searches, but did not often modify those queries. Short searches were exemplified by participants finding relevant items by entering only one query. For example, one participant obtained a recipe for banana walnut bread successfully by creating a query  X  X  X anana bread X  X  in Google and accessing a relevant item immediately.

Second, two typical types of iterative patterns were found in medium searches: iterative search result evaluation and iter-ative exploration. These two types of iterative patterns were repeated several times in typical medium searches. The follow-ing examples show one iterative search result evaluation and one iterative exploration, respectively.

Creat ? (a list of search results) ? EvalR ? AccF ? (an individual item) ? EvalI ? Use or fail to use ? AccB ? (the list of search results) ? EvalR ? AccF ? (an individual item) ? EvalI ? Use or fail to use ? [iteration] ... ? [enter an individual item] ? EvalI ? Use or fail to use ? Xplor ? AccF (internal or external link) ? (an individual item) ? EvalI ? Use or fail to use ? Xplor ? AccF (internal or external link) ? (an individual item) ? EvalI ? Use or fail to use ? Xplor ? [iteration]
Third, long searches are typically the extension of medium searches. In long searches, more than 10 cycles of the iterative patterns identified above are usually observed within one search session. Also, in long sessions, participants applied the most
EvalI tactics (5.0%). This shows that participants conducting long search sessions expended more effort in evaluating individ-ual documents of the search results. 5.3.2. Search phases and tactic selection
Search phase is another search process-related factor investigated. Table 11 presents the frequency of and proportions of search tactics at the beginning, middle, and ending phases. The association between search phase and tactic application was investigated by conducting a Chi-square test. The test result rejected the null hypothesis, and it revealed that there is a sig-nificant association between selection of search tactics and search phases, v
When examining the beginning six tactics, the authors found that the proportions of Creat (16.0%) and EvalR (15.4%) were higher at the beginning phase than in the other phases. Most of the beginning sessions included at least one Creat tactic. Of 53 cases, only five cases did not include Creat at the beginning phase. To be more specific, in more than 90% of the search sessions, participants created a query or queries to get their search tasks started within the first six search tactics. Middle and ending phases showed similar patterns of tactic application; however, the percentage of Xplor (7.2%) in ending phases was lower than that in middle phases. Instead, the proportions of EvalI (27.4%) and Use (13.8%) were higher in ending phases than those in middle phases. Participants focused more on evaluating and using items in the ending phases. Even though participants of this study did not apply many Mon tactics, 9 out of 14 Mon tactics observed occurred in the ending phase.
Participants of the study monitored their search process more in the ending phase than in other phases. 5.4. System types 5.4.1. System types and tactic selection
System type is the key factor examined for its association with tactic selection. Based on log data, the usage of four types of web-based IR systems was observed  X  search engines, Web pages, online databases, and OPACs. Table 12 presents the cross-tabulation between system type and search tactic selection. A Chi Square analysis rejected the null hypothesis, v 2 (30, N = 3735) = 210.472, p &lt; .01, suggesting that there was a significant relationship between system type and tactic selection.

Search engines, online databases, and OPACs generally led to the application of query-related tactics such as Creat (4.1%, 4.2%, and 5.0%), Mod (3.0%, 2.8%, and 5.0%), and EvalR (11.6%, 13.9%, and 19.3%). Verbal protocol and diary data corroborate the log and questionnaire data. Here are some examples that illustrate the typical patterns of searching different types of IR systems. One of the participants described her pattern of using search engines,  X  X (after entering the query) ... looking at first following example shows how OPACs are associated with search related tactics.  X  X  X County Cat (library catalog)] I type in
County Cat box, option  X  X eywords X  on drop down box search terms: biometrics, microchip, or digital security ( Creat ); I can skim through it and decide if this is the material I need for this research project ( EvalR ). X  X  For Webpages, EvaI (24.8%),
AccF (29.4%), and Xplor (12.8%) were the most frequently applied tactics. Creat, Mod , and EvalR tactics occurred less often, showing 3.2%, 0.6%, and 5.5%, respectively. The ratio of Use (9.1%) in Web pages was higher than in search engines (6.1%), online databases (4.2%), and OPACs (2.8%).

The design of IR systems leads to the selection of different types of search tactics. The authors found that participants selected different search tactics based on the availability and the design of system features. Specific features influenced whether participants employed specific search tactics. In the cases of search engines, online databases, and OPACs, Creat and EvalR tactics that are related to a query search occurred more frequently than they did in the case of Web pages. Con-versely, the ratios of Xplor for search engines, online databases, and OPACs were lower than for Web pages. Search engines, online databases, and OPACs usually provide their search functions in a prominent place on the first page. Online databases showed a relatively high ratio of Org tactics, accounting for 13.9% because of their search result organizing functions (e.g., sorting and filtering). One participant, who was using an online database system equipped with sorting functions, applied
Org tactics a couple of times to obtain the optimized search results. Here is one example of verbal protocol in relation to applying Org tactics:  X  X  ... looking at results 1 X 100 and organized by date (Org). X  X  Conversely, limited system features would prevent users from applying certain types of search tactics. As shown in examples below, unavailability of system features leads to not using related search tactics.  X  X  X here was really no option for sorting ( Not Org ).

Discussion A significant contribution of this study lies in uncovering factors that are associated with users X  search tactic selections.
Eight factors that represent task (work task and search task), user perceived knowledge level (familiarity with topic, famil-iarity with sources, and search skills), search process (search session length and search phases), and system (system types) were examined in relation to the selection of search tactics. Based on the findings of this study, design implications are dis-cussed. Fig. 2 presents a summary of factors, search tactics, and system design implications. This study suggests that IR sys-system needs to better support users X  application of different search tactics based on their tasks and their knowledge levels. Here are the suggestions for IR system design:
First, since users might select different IR systems for different types of work tasks, the design of an IR system needs to provide different features to support a specific type of work task. Users are likely to use a relatively high proportion of tactics such as Mod, EvalR and Org in accomplishing scholarly tasks. This indicates that IR systems, such as online dat-abases and OPACs, should enable users to apply various functions to support query reformulation, search result evalua-tion, and result organization in performing scholarly search tasks. For example, system designers can employ features like presenting relevant meta-information of search results, categorizing results by different topics, and offering different options for sorting search results. For query reformulations, the IR systems can offer multiple query manipulation, sec-ondary window usage, query feedback and suggestions, query and search result tracking, and others ( Rieh &amp; Xie, 2006; Kelly, Gyllstrom, &amp; Bailey, 2009 ). At the same time, users prefer exploring the Web using simply Xplor and AccF in searching popular tasks. They tend to browse different sites by clicking on URLs. This finding implies that system design for popular tasks, such as Web search engines and Web pages, should focus on the enhancement of browsing func-tions, such as different options for browsing, and offering task-oriented browsing in addition to subject browsing ( Mu,
Ryu, &amp; Lu, 2011 ). In addition, popular tasks also require the application of comparison strategy for some types of specific tasks, such as shopping, and travelling. The incorporation of a comparison mechanism with different criteria that can be selected in these IR systems, as well as linking similar results from different systems can help users quickly find the best items. In cases of occupational tasks, comparatively high proportions of iterative exploration patterns of web pages were observed, so these web pages need to be equipped with functions for supporting iterative browsing, such as well-structured categories of relevant items dedicated to a specific occupational area. For IR systems that users might use for multiple types of tasks, the design needs to consider the incorporation of a variety of features to support different types of work tasks.

Second, an IR system can offer templates for different types of search tasks. For subject-oriented tasks, in which users intensively apply iterative evaluation, the IR system can focus on facilitating search result evaluation by using well-pre-sented meta-information, categorizing search results by tasks, and sorting search results in different ways. Moreover, the
IR system should also focus on enhancing the efficiency of the hub and spoke structure to present search results and related items together to reduce the need to navigate forward and backward ( Catledge &amp; Pitkow, 1995; Thatcher, 2006 ). For specific information search tasks, it is better for IR systems to present quick answers instead of documents to respond to the specific information tasks. For example, Yahoo! Shortcuts Search can help users find specific information efficiently by using special words and symbols ( http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/search/basics/basics-05.html ). For known-item searching, it is useful to integrate users X  personal information systems/space, such as their emails, bookmarks, and personal folders, into IR systems; this can support users in known-item search tasks by helping them access the items easily and quickly.

Third, familiarity with search topic is closely related to users X  domain knowledge. IR systems need to design different fea-tures for users with different levels of domain knowledge. One approach to identifying users X  levels of domain knowledge is to enable users to customize  X  X  X y System X  X  so that they can create  X  X  X ser Profiles X  X  including their levels of domain and system knowledge. Another approach is to infer users X  domain knowledge by analyzing query terms. If a user enters pro-fessional or expert level terms in his/her search queries, a system can infer he/she has expertise in the topic area, and vice versa. This study revealed that users familiar with a search topic would mainly concentrate on evaluating the search results instead of individual documents, whereas users unfamiliar with a topic are more likely to concentrate on query creation and evaluation of individual documents. Thus, a system needs to respond differently to users with different lev-els of domain knowledge. For users familiar with a topic, systems should provide an enhanced result list with short sum-mary and categorized overviews ( Kules &amp; Shneiderman, 2008 ), since that can facilitate users identifying relevant items easily without examining individual documents. For users unfamiliar with a topic, systems should help them choose appropriate query terms by offering different features, such as recommending expert queries and controlled vocabularies, providing automatic query term suggestions, and finding documents like this one. In addition to evaluation features for search results, it is also useful for IR systems to offer best passages of individual documents, so users can quickly make relevance/usefulness judgments.

Fourth, as to users X  search skills, it turns out expert users more frequently use EvalR, advanced searches, and Org .Itis important to design IR systems to support both user control and ease-of-use. The design implication for EvalR is discussed in the suggestion for supporting subject search tasks above. In spite of a simplified interface and features for novice users, the design of the more advanced features of query formulation and reformulation as well as result organization will enable expert users to manipulate their queries and search results, and integrate them into their own works. One option is to allow them to use special commands to construct more specific queries. Another one could be related to enabling users to come up with their own sorting criteria. More advanced features for other types search activities are also helpful.
Fifth, medium searches consist of iterative patterns of search result evaluation and exploration, and long searches show relatively more efforts in item evaluation. These results lead to the following design suggestions. For medium searches, system design should pay attention to reducing unnecessary iterations of search result evaluation or exploration, as dis-cussed in supporting subject-oriented tasks above. In order to support effective document evaluation, the system should support the evaluation activities of users, such as highlighting key points, providing most relevant paragraphs and sum-maries, and offering rankings and comments specified by other users.

Sixth, three sequential search phases  X  beginning, middle, and ending  X  present different patterns of search tactic selec-tion. As expected, Creat tactics were the most important tactics applied by participants to get a search session started.
More than 90% of search sessions had at least one Creat tactic in their beginning phases. To support the starting phases with query creation, a system can be equipped with query creation aid functions such as basic and advanced search, query error correction, query suggestions, and controlled vocabularies. Middle phases involved many iteration patterns of eval-uating search results and exploration. Again, system design is related to reducing unnecessary iterations of search result evaluation or exploration, as discussed in supporting subject-oriented tasks above. During ending phases, relatively high percentage of EvalI was observed. System design can offer the options of display document according to different types of search tasks, such as highlighting key fields for known item searches, extracting key data/information for specific infor-mation searches, and presenting best passages for subject searches. Since Use occurred most frequently at the ending phase, it is helpful for IR systems to enable users to integrate their searches into their work spaces.
 Seventh, users applied different search tactics in different types of IR systems/resources. In searching search engines,
Creat , Mod , EvalR , and AccF consisted of 91.4% of applied search tactics. Also, online databases and OPACs showed higher percentage of EvalR as well as lower percentage of Xplor . Webpage users, however, frequently applied exploration strat-gest two possible approaches to information system design: (1) an integrated system for different types of information sources and (2) an individual system that supports all possible search tactic applications. The integrated system offers common access to different types of sources, such as web materials, online databases, and library resources, simulta-neously in one consolidated system. Using this integrated approach, the system could offer various information sources to users. Also, the integrated system would allow users to compare search results from different sources since it could present the results from different systems. Moreover, once a user was to learn how to use the integrated system, he/ she would not need to make an effort to learn different individual systems. Another approach is to enhance individual systems to support multiple search tactics during search processes. IR systems need to support tactics in relation to query creation and modification, as well as search tactics that are in relation to exploration, organization, monitoring, evalua-tion, etc. For example, although users tend to select browsing-related tactics in using individual web pages, these web pages still need to provide strong search functions to help users apply search-related tactics. Although users rely more on search-related tactics in online databases and OPACs, they still have a need for browsing items. Moreover, system design needs to better support users in evaluating search results and individual documents and organizing search results by different criteria discussed above. In addition, IR systems need to allow users to know where they are and how they get there. Thus, individual systems need to support multiple tactics in different types of systems. Further, if standardized fea-tures were provided over different types of systems, it could assist users to use different systems with less effort in learn-ing each system.

This study has some limitations. First, 31 participants might not be able to represent the general public, even though the study analyzed 3788 tactics observed in 60 search sessions. Second, think-aloud protocols were useful to capture verbaliza-tion of participants X  thoughts, but they might not grasp all complicated thoughts during their search processes. Third, this study was based on the analysis of data generated from one search session. That might lead to the loss of realism, since, in reality, users could engage in multiple search sessions in order to accomplish their search tasks. Fourth, the eight factors that are statistically examined in this study might not be sufficient to understand users X  tactic selection behaviors. Obviously, there are more relevant factors that are not mentioned in the present paper. Fifth, the authors were unable to conduct mul-tivariate analysis, in particular multiple regression, to test and identify potential interactions among factors affecting the use of search tactics because of the limitation of the data, e.g., frequency of search tactics and categorical data of some of the factor variables. Further research is discussed in the conclusion to respond to the limitations of this study. 7. Conclusion
The study investigated users X  search tactic selection and associated factors in achieving their real tasks. The main contri-bution of this study can be summarized as follows. (1) This study did not focus on one type of search tactic as many of the prior studies did; instead, it explored multiple search tactics that are applied during the search process. (2) This study exam-ined factors in relation to multiple dimensions, including tasks, user X  X  perceived knowledge, search process and system types, and their relationships with search tactic selection. (3) This study not only statistically tested the association between factors and search tactic selection, but also discovered in what ways these factors influence the selection of search tactics. (4) The implications of system design are systematically discussed corresponding to findings of this study.

Considering the limitations of this study addressed above, further research is needed to generalize the results and en-hance the study. Next, the authors will expand this study to more participants with a variety of tasks in real settings to better generalize the results. Foremost, future research should not be limited to search tactics applied in users X  interaction with
Web-based IR systems. Instead, it should extend to all the tactics applied in users X  interactions with all types of resources, including human resources and printed materials in the search process. This will enable the design of better IR systems to integrate all different resources. In addition, more factors that would potentially influence search tactic selections will be included in the future study. There are a number of potential factors not covered fully in the present study, such as task dif-ficulty, task urgency, age, job, search stage, help system, and others. Future studies will cover a variety of factors more exten-sively to portray the entire picture of search tactic selection in diverse information environments. Finally, future research also needs to investigate interaction effects among factors by using multivariate statistical analysis. In order to conduct mul-tivariate statistical analysis, the dependent variable, tactic selection, has to be measured by a continuous scale. The investi-gation of how different factors affect the selection of search tactics will greatly help researchers understand the nature of information retrieval process and designers enhance the design of IR systems.
