Some of the major problems with information retrieval in search engines are: 1.1.1. Choice of search term(s) constitute the phrase. 1.1.2. General keyword searching as the default &amp; Etzioni, 2000; Tillett, 2001 ). 1.1.3. Navigating and browsing retrieved pages 1999; Oyama, Kokubo, &amp; Ishida, 1999; Spink &amp; Xu, 2000 ). 1.1.4.

From our primary research aim, the following research questions arose:
Sciences? in the two subject areas? title, exact URL? 4. Design of the study not so explicitly identify it at a sentence or contextual level (c.f. Section 1.3 ). 4.1. Data collection The research was carried out in two phases ical terms.

Relevant statistical analyses, such as frequency, percentage, mean, T -test, and v out on the data gathered. 4.2. Data analysis the frequencies in the two domains. 5. Results and discussion 5.1. Frequencies of NTTs and STTs in Health and Social Sciences bers and percentages separately for NTTs and for STTs are also given. 5.2. Difference in frequencies of NTTs between the Social Sciences and Health of Medicine, 2006; HealthLink, 2006 ). 5.3. Most frequent non-topical terms shared between the Social Sciences and Health occurred only in the Health domain (see Appendix A , Ranks 20 and 29, respectively). 5.4. Location of NTTs (including STTs) more  X  X atural X  in normal English discourse in the Social Sciences than in Health domains. 5.5. Separate NTTs and STTs Frequencies subject domain (or sub-domain) may be too time consuming and therefore too costly to implement. 5.6. Differences in search results between the Social Sciences and Health out further expanding them with other relevant terms results in an overwhelming number of hits. searches X  and  X  X TT + TT searches X  in the two domains.
 through NTTs in Exact title and Exact URL searches in the two domains perform equally well.
Also to illustrate the value of query expansion though NTTs we divided the average frequency of mains and, therefore, is recommended to all searchers.
 (see Table 1 ), such terms have a wider usage in the title and URL of Web documents in Health. 6. Conclusions to retrieve more precise and more manageable results.
