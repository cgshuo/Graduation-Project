 In the past decades of years, recommende r systems have been widely studied in the academia and deployed in the industry, such as Amazon Online Shop and Yahoo! Music etc. However, there are still some challenges in traditional recommender systems. The well known one is that most modern commercial recommender systems are facing serious sparsity and cold-start problem as the average density of the available ratings is often less than 1%.

In our real life online shopping, people always tend to ask their friends for recommendations of nice mobile phone or fantastic movies, or view product X  X  or movie X  X  comments to make decisions, we are actually doing social recommen-dations everyday in our normal life. Theref ore, these social act ions are precious information for obtaining people X  X  inter ests, which could provide more personal-ized recommendation and improve recommender systems.

In this paper, we aim at solving the sparsity and cold-start problems with social actions information and modeling a better performance recommender sys-tem. Based on the intuition that user X  X  trust relations can be employed to en-hance traditional recommender systems, our approach assumes a social network among users and makes recommendations for a user based on the ratings of the users that have direct or indirect social re lations with the given user. Therefore, we believe that users X  social action information can provide more valuable clue to improve collaborative filtering performance. Our model works under an as-sumption that actions between users on the social network are conducted if they share very similar values and interests. The more frequently they interact, the higher similarity their interests share.

We propose a social recommendation gr aphical model employing users X  re-lations based on their social actions. The social network information including friends X  relations and commenting interactions are employed in designing a new social recommender system with probabilistic matrix factorization. Our experi-ments were performed on the datas et that we crawled from Douban 1 .
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Some related work is discussed in section 2. A simple description of social recommender framework and an introduction to our proposed model is gi ven in section 3. Experimental result is shown in section 4. Finally, we conclude the paper and present some directions for future work. In this section, we review several major approaches for recommender systems, especially for collaborative filtering . Generally two type of recommender systems have been investigated: Memory-based and Model-based recommenders.

Memory-based approaches are the most popular prediction methods and are widely adopted in commercial collaborative filtering systems. Memory-based al-gorithms explore the user-item rating matrix and make recommendations based on the ratings of item i by a set of users whose rating profiles are most similar to that user u . The most analyzed examples of memo ry-based collaborative filtering include user-based approaches and item-based approaches.

On the contrary, model-based approaches learn the parameters of a model and store only those parameters. Hence they do not need to explore the rating matrix and only store the model parameters. Model-based approaches are very fast after the parameters of the model are learnt. The bottleneck for model-based approaches is the training phase, while in memory-based approaches there is no training, but the prediction (test) phase is time-consuming. Major model-based approaches include the clustering model [1], aspect models [2], the Bayesian model [3] and the most famous latent fa ctor model [4,5]. Recently, some matrix factorization methods [6,3,7,8] have been proposed for collaborative filtering. These methods all focus on fitting the user-item rating matrix using low-rank approximations, and use it to make fur ther predictions. Recently, due to the efficiency in dealing with large datasets, s everal low-dimensional matrix factor-ization methods have been proposed for Collaborative filtering [8]. The premise behind the low-rank factor model is that there is only a user X  X  preference vector determined by how each factor applies to that user.

All these methods mentioned above do not agree with a real life recommenda-tion as they care little about social network information. Actually, many re-searchers have recently started to anal yze trust-based recommender systems based on this intuition. In [9,10], a social trust ensembled collaborative filtering method for recommender systems is proposed. 3.1 Recommendations with Social Actions In this section, we present our approach to incorporate social action relation into a matrix factorization model for recommendations in social network.
The author of [10] proposed a matrix factorization approach for social network based recommendation, called STE. Their method is a linear combination of basic matrix factorization approach [7] and a social network based approach. The predicted rating of user u on item i is as follows: where U u and V i represent user-specific and item-specific latent feature vector respectively, N u represent the friend set of user u ,and R u,i represent the final prediction. Parameter  X  controls the effects of neighbo rs on the estimated rating. T u,v stands for trust value between user u and v . g (
However, their work just care about user social friend relations. In our real life, even some of our friends may have totally different tastes in a social network. Maybe they are friends just because they are co-workers, partners, relatives, or maybe a celebrity who pays little attention to ordinary people.

We believe that users X  social action information can provide more valuable clue to improve collaborative filtering performance. Our model works under an assumption that actions between users on the social network are conducted as they share very similar values and intere sts. The more frequently they interact, the higher similar their interests match. Incorporating with users X  social action relations, we can magnify the affect factor of similarity to those who really share same interest and contact frequently wh ile decrease the factor to those who are just normal friend and have little common interest.

Based on the STE model [10] Hao M. et al. proposed, we merge our social actions as a new factor into the model. The graphical model of our proposed approach is illustrated in Fig.1.

In Fig.1, U F and U B represent user-friends and user-action latent feature vector respectivel y. The parameter  X  controls the final mixture of original PMF model and STE model and parameter  X  controls the mixture between social relations and actions. The weight F u,v is represented for the similarity between user u and user v ,andtheweight B u,v is represented for the intensity of user u  X  X  and user v  X  X  social actions.

As the assumption we just mentioned above, we define the user-action metrics as: where N u,v is the frequency of actions between u and v . g (  X  ) is a sigmoid function that map frequency into interval [0,1).

According to probabilistic matrix factorization model, we redefine the new model conditional distribution over the observed ratings as where N ( x |  X ,  X  2 ) is the probability density function of the Gaussian distribution with mean  X  and  X  2 , S ( i ) stands for the neighborhoods of user i ,and I ij is the indicator function that is equal to 1 if user i rated movie j and equal to 0 otherwise. Hence, similar to Eq.3, th rough a Bayesian inference, we have In this section, we conduct several experiments to compare the recommenda-tion performance of our approach with other state-of-the-art recommendation methods. 4.1 Dataset Description We choose Douban as the data source for our experiments on recommendation incorporating with social actions. We crawled movies X  ratings, users and com-ments, and used these users as seed to further crawl their social network infor-mation. Finally, we obtain 244,015 unique users and 879 movies with 1,415,120 movie ratings. We got 8,394,452 record of user-friend relations with 5554 max degree and 10.2 average degree, 71,181 record of user-comment relations with 5355 max degree and 5.7 average degree. By the way, we also validate the dataset we crawled has a long-tail effect. 4.2 Experimental Results In this section, in order to show the performance improvement of our social action approach, we compare our method with the following approaches: 1. PMF: this method is proposed by Salakhutdinov and Minh in [7]. It only 2. STE: this method is proposed by Hao Ma in [10]. It uses social trust relations We conduct our experiment with 80% training data and to predict the remaining 20% of ratings. The random selection was carried out 10 times independently. The curves of MAE and RMSE are shown in Fig.2(a).
The experimental results 2 on the Douban dataset clearly demonstrate that social action incorporated model indeed ou tperforms existing methods for social network based recommendation. By incorporating more social information, we extend previous normal social friend rela tions. Hence, our model further decrease the noise of friend relations and improve the performace of recommender system. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach incorporating users social actions into a model-based approach for recommendation using probabilistic matrix fac-torization. Similar to the STE model pres ented in [10], our social action based model learns the latent feature vectors o f users and items. Different from STE, we incorporate more social action information apart from social relation information to extend normal social friend relation. This extra information can reduce the bias and asymmetric relations. This work suggests several interesting directions for future work. Further, we want to incorporate more social action information not only just comments. Our model is a generic approach and can easily add other social action information into the model, such as forwards, mentions, and follows information.
