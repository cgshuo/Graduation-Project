 1. Introduction perturbations degrade the system performance of biped robots, or time-varying external perturbations, learning control methods can help to increase the stability ma rgin and prevent the robot from falling down.
 the learning ability of dynamic biped walking, many learning have been proposed with some promising results. For example, to compensate for external perturbations by controlling the joint motions of the trunk. Experiment s are carried out to control the et al. (2006) presented a RL method designed particularly for the Quasi-Passive Dynamic Walking (PDW) of a biped robot whose the obtained controller is robust against variations in the slope gradient and sudden perturbatio ns. However, there are some limi-tations when the above-mentioned learning methods are applied to biped walking control. The NNs and FLSs always depend on the learning the complex biped dynamics in real time. The RL is an robots, while the considerable computational complexity makes it not easy to implement the learning control in real-time. For the
CPGs, which are neuron networks that produce coordinated oscilla-tory signals without sensory feed backs, there exists an uncertain problem of the weights designing.
 Different from the above-mentioned learning methods, the
SVM ( Cortes and Vapnik, 1995 ) is a statistical learning method which learns and makes decisions using the practical engineering data more than the expertise. SVMs were originally developed for solving the classification problem, and then they have been extended to the domain of regression problems ( Drucker et al, 1997 ). The term SVM is typically used to describe support vector describe regression with support vector methods. In this work, the term SVM will refer to regression methods. The structural risk minimization (SRM) principle used in SVMs gives them the ability to solve learning problems with small-sample-sizes ( Saludes is good for learning the complex dynamics of biped robots using limited samples. Ferreira et al. (2009) compared two intelligent learning control approaches, SVR and neural fuzzy (NF) network, Some experiments are presented and the results show that the SVR controller runs about 50 times faster than the NF controller. Kim et al. (2009) also demonstrated that the SVR can be effectively applied to model and control a practical biped walking robot. Ou et al. (2009) discussed the SVM-based representation of human control strategies using a parametric model and the SVM-based controlling of dynamically stable systems. They compared the SVM with NN approaches and the experiments demonstrated the superiority of the SVM for human control strategy learning. However, in previous works, time properties of the training data has been neglected because all the samples are treated uniformly, which leads to a result that the traditional SVMs cannot learn the current dynamic timely and accurately, and cannot compensate for the time-varying external disturbances timely and accurately.
To address this problem, a TSF-SVM learning control system for biped walking robots is proposed. First, derivation of the TSF-SVM the dynamic models for the whole walking cycle of biped robots, including the SSP and the DSP, are discussed. To compensate time-varying external disturbances u sing the proposed TSF-SVM, time-sequence-based triangular and Gaussian fuzzy membership functions proposed TSF-SVM learning method is realized using a moving time window. The proposed fuzzy membership functions move along the time axis when the sampling time window moves along the time walking cycle are designed dynamically. The performance of the proposed TSF-SVM are compared with other typical intelligent methods, simulation results demonstrate the proposed method is the stability margin and prevents the robot from falling down. The main contributions of this paper include two aspects:
For the first time, a TSF-SVM learning control system con-sidering time properties of biped walking samples is proposed, which provides new clues for compensating time-varying external disturbances timely for biped walking robots.
For the first time, time-sequence-based triangular and Gaus-sian fuzzy membership functions are proposed for the SSP and the DSP respectively according to time properties of different biped phases, which provides an effective way to formulate time properties of the training data in the context of time-varying external disturbances.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 , the dynamical models for the whole walking cycle of biped robots are represented. A TSF-SVM learning control system for biped robots is proposed in Section 3 . Simulation results are provided in Section 4 , followed by the conclusions in Section 5 . 2. Dynamic models for the whole walking cycle of biped robots
Human walking can be treated as a series of steps which are elementary reference movements that can be executed in a variety of ways, but with strictly defined basic kinematic char-acteristics. The whole human walking cycle is made up of two main kinematically distinct phases ( Choi et al., 2007 ; Asano and Luo, 2008 ; Lee et al., 2008 ; Sugihara and Nakamura, 2009 ; Humphrey et al., 2010 ), which is shown in Fig. 1 . The first is a
SSP or swing phase, during which the locomotion system evolves as an open kinematic chain. The second is a DSP, during which the locomotion system moves as a closed kinematic loop. The evolu-tion of the biped as an open or a closed kinematic loop results in a mechanical system moving with a time-varying kinematic topology. This characteristic will have significant consequences on the dynamic modeling of the walking cycle, on the dynamic synthesis of movement and on the control of the biped.
The dynamic equations of the SSP can be derived by means of the familiar Euler X  X agrange formulation as follows:
M  X  y  X   X  y  X  C  X  y , _ y  X  _ y  X  G  X  y  X  X  t  X  t d  X  1  X  where y A R n describes the generalized coordinates, M  X  y  X  input torque is t A R n .
 The dynamic equations of the DSP are also derived from the
Euler X  X agrange formulation. The fact that the robot foot stays on the ground adds two supplementary constraints of the form x set of joint coordinates, which allow us to write the dynamic equations as
M  X  y  X   X  y  X  C  X  y , _ y  X  _ y  X  G  X  y  X  X  J T  X  y  X  F  X  t  X  t d  X  2  X  of constraint.

Because the time property of the training data is not consid-ity of biped robots in the SSP and the relative stationary mode of biped robots in the DSP, a TSF-SVM learning control system considering different time properties of the SSP and the DSP for biped robots is proposed in the following section. 3. Design a TSF-SVM learning control system for biped robots
Biped robots suffer from various disturbances when they implement walking locomotion. They must be robust against those disturbances for dynamic balance, which can be ensured through satisfying the famous ZMP criterion ( Huang and Nakamura, 2005 ; Vukobratovic et al., 2006 ). The proposed TSF-SVM learning control system is to keeping the ZMP inside the convex hull of the foot support region of biped robots, even there are time-varying external disturbances taking place.
 no matter if they have different contribution to learn the current dynamic. When unexpected disturbances occur, the accuracy of the learning could be decreased because the learning results tend to represent the past dynamic which has no disturbances yet. As a and the ZMP criterion cannot be satisfied well.
 in Fig. 2 . To compensate time-varying external disturbances timely and accurately, the contributions of the newest walking samples are emphasized. To describe time properties of biped walking samples, triangular and Gaussian fuzzy membership functions are designed for the SSP and the DSP respectively.
To prevent the learning control system from delayed action, an online sampling strategy for the TSF-SVM is implemented using a moving time window. Using the proposed TSF-SVM learning algorithm considering time properties of the walking data, the biped dynamic satisfying the ZMP criterion can be learned timely and accurately when time-varying external disturbances occur. 3.1. TSF-SVM learning algorithm for biped robots sing the driven torque of the supporting hip in the SSP is where o is a weight vector and b is a bias. f U  X  X  is a nonlinear mapping function for mapping the input space into a higher dimen-sion feature space. x i represents the input vector and y ship function, which will be designed in the following sections. b sup_ hip is the corresponding bias.
 parameter x i in problem (3) such that the corresponding walking sample is treated as less important. To compensate time-varying external disturbances timely and accurately, the contributions of the newest walking samples are emphasized. Therefore, larger learning weights are assigned to the recent walking samples, and smaller learning weights are assigned to the past walking sam-ples. The learning weights for the samples can be calculated using the fuzzy membership functions designed in the next sections. To solve this optimization problem, we construct the Lagrangian
L o , b sup_ hip , x , a  X  1 2 o T o satisfy the following conditions: 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : Eliminating o and x using Eq. (5) , problem (3) can be trans-formed into 0 A T "#  X  X  a 1 , a 2 , , a N T ,and O is a square matrix, which has elements of
Submitting the optimal a and b sup_ hip , the regression function of the TSF-SVM for learning the driven torque of the supporting hip in the SSP is b the driven torque of the supporting ankle in the SSP, driven torque of the left knee and driven torque of the right knee in the DSP are as follows, which can be obtained using the same approach mentioned in this section. supporting ankle in the SSP, driven torque of the left knee in the DSP and driven torque of the right knee in the DSP respectively. b the other symbols have the same definitions as those in Eq. (8) . Until now, the TSF-SVM regression functions for the control torque of the supporting hip and ankle in the SSP, the left knee and the right knee in the DSP are all obtained as shown in Eqs. (8) X (11) .

As deduced above, to obtain the optimal control torques for the whole walking cycle of biped robots, the newest samples closer to the current dynamic are treated as more important during the TSF-SVM learning, and different fuzzy membership functions will be designed for the SSP and the DSP in the follow-ing sections. 3.2. TSF-SVM learning control in the DSP 3.2.1. Dynamic model to be learned using the TSF-SVM in the DSP
In the DSP, to ensure the dynamic balance of biped robots, it is the right knee. Referring to Liu et al. (2007) , there are certain nonlinear dynamics among the five variables in the biped system, including the joint angle of the left knee, the joint angle of the right knee, the position of the ZMP, the driven torque of the left 2007 ) expressed this nonlinear dynamic as a fuzzy logic rule, which has three inputs and two outputs, and the control for the biped in the DSP is implemented effectively.
 work try to decompose the fuzzy-logic-based complex nonlinear dynamic into two parallel learning rules, and each rule has two inputs and one output. With the same control mechanism which has been proved to be effective, the new single learning rule becomes simpler, and it shows us a new angle of view to research the biped locomotion mechanism. When the SVM learning machine is considered, the learning rule with two inputs and one output can be expressed through a three-dimension graphic, which is intuitive for the research of the biped control mechan-ism. The proposed learning rule in the DSP is that when the ZMP criterion is satisfied, the dynamic between the torque control inputs and the joint angles can be written as ( dynamics in the DSP to be learned using the proposed TSF-SVM. 3.2.2. Design a time-sequence-based triangular fuzzy membership function for the DSP
The recent samples contribute more than the past samples when the current dynamic is considered to be learned. The importance of biped walking samples can be indicated using some linguistic the importance of past samples is  X  X  X ow X  X . However, the  X  X  X igh importance X  X  and the  X  X  X ow importance X  X  of biped walking samples functions are time-independent. To formulate the contribution of samples in the DSP, a time-sequence-based triangular fuzzy mem-bership function is proposed in this section.

Due to relative stationary mode in the DSP (compared with the highly unstable SSP of biped robots), a triangular ( Lin and Wang, 2002 ) fuzzy membership function, which is the left half of a trigonometric function is proposed as the membership function for samples in the DSP, and the formula for the time-sequence-based triangular fuzzy membership function is as follows: m t  X  i  X  1 , 2 , , n ,  X  , m i _ triangular A  X  d , 1 ,and d need to be designed. t start and t end are the beginning and the ending of the time window respectively. To explain the basic idea of the proposed fuzzy membership function, a sample set
G  X  t , t end can be calculated according to the following details:
G m 8 &lt; :  X  14  X  sequence-based tri angular fuzzy membership grades. t i  X  n 1 symbols have the same definitions as those in Eq. (13) .
As shown in Fig. 3 , the value of the triangular fuzzy membership function increases with time. That means that in the time window sample S i far back in the past, the recent sample S i  X  n 1 fuzzy membership grade, whic h means that the recent sample S contributes more for learning the current biped dynamic. When time t i  X  n comes,thetimewindowmovesrightinto  X  t i  X  1 , t i  X  n membership function moves to right when the sampling time window moves to right. As a result, the time-sequence-based fuzzy membership grades of walking samples in the whole interval t i A 0 ,  X 1  X  are designed dynamically. 3.3. TSF-SVM learning control in the SSP 3.3.1. Dynamic model to be learned using the TSF-SVM in the SSP important to pay close attention to the control of the supporting are certain nonlinear dynamics among the five variables in the biped system, including the joint angle of the supporting ankle, the joint angle of the supporting hip, the position of the ZMP, the driven torque of the supporting ankle and the driven torque of nonlinear dynamic as another fuzzy logic rule, which also has three inputs and two outputs, and the control for the biped in the SSP is implemented effectively.
 is that when the ZMP criterion is satisfied, the dynamic between the torque control inputs and the joint angles of the SSP can be written as ( angles of the supporting hip and the supporting ankle. f U  X  X  are the nonlinear dynamics in the SSP to be learned using the proposed TSF-SVM. 3.3.2. Design a time-sequence-based Gaussian fuzzy membership function for the SSP should be emphasized to compensate time-varying external disturbances timely and accurately. To formulate the contribution of the biped walking samples in the SSP, a time-sequence-based Gaussian fuzzy membership function is proposed in this section. with the DSP of biped robots), a Gaussian fuzzy membership as the fuzzy membership function for samples in the SSP, and the formula for the time-sequence-based Gaussian fuzzy membership function is as follows: m t same definitions as those in Eq. (13) . Taking the sample set
G i _ Gaussian shown in Fig. 4 as an example, the Gaussian fuzzy membership grade for every sample in the time window can be calculated according to the following details: ( where S i is the sampling data, including the joint angle and control torque shown in Eq. (15) . G i _ Gaussian is a sample set containing time-sequence-based Gaussian fuzzy membership grades. Other symbols have the same definitions as those in
Eq. (16) . As shown in Fig. 4 , the value of the Gaussian fuzzy membership function increases with time. Furthermore, the fuzzy membership grades in the Gaussian function increase exponen-fuzzy membership grade when it is compared with the sample S in the green time window  X  t i , t i  X  n 1 . When time t i  X  n window, the sample S i  X  n has a larger fuzzy membership grade when compared with the sample S i  X  1 , and the variation is more remarkable compared with the situation shown in Fig. 3 . Similar to the situation of the triangular one mentioned above, the
Gaussian fuzzy membership function moves to right when the sampling time window moves to right, and fuzzy membership grades for walking samples of the whole dynamic walking process are assigned online. 3.4. Online training of the proposed TSF-SVM
Biped dynamics could change with the process of walking, which happen at any time for biped robots with numerous degrees of freedom and complex dynamics, SVMs with offline trainings could walking data is implemented using a TS-MLW in this work. The detailed realization method of the TS-MLW is as follows.
For example, when the recent sampling time is t i  X  n 1 , the time the moving window is t n , and the current sampling set is
S for every sample in the green time window can be calculated by the fuzzy membership function which is represented as a green line. Then, the fuzzy membership grade for the walking data in the most left end of the green time window is m and the fuzzy membership grade for the walking data in the most right end of the green time window is m definitions as those in Eq. (13) .

When the recent sampling time is t i  X  n , then the time window window is still t n , and the current sampling set is S for every sample in the red time window can be calculated by the fuzzy membership function which is represented as a red line. Then, the fuzzy membership grade for the walking data in the most left end of the red time window is m and the fuzzy membership grade for the walking data in the most right end of the red time window is m definitions as those in Eq. (13) . Similar to the situation of the triangular one mentioned above, the Gaussian fuzzy membership function realizes the online training through the TS-MLW shown in Fig. 4 . Using such a mechanism, the fuzzy membership function is moving along the time axis, and the sample set containing fuzzy membership grades of the walking data is generated based on the sampling time sequence. 4. Simulation research
In this section, the proposed TSF-SVM learning control method is tested on the control of a seven-link biped robot by simulation experiments. The proposed method is compared with intelligent methods such as FL, SVM and NN. 4.1. Simplified model of the simulated biped robot
The simplified model of the simulated biped robot built here consists of a trunk and two legs. The trunk has one degree of freedom (DOF) in the waist joint. Each leg is composed of a thigh, hip joint, one in the knee joint, and one in the ankle joint. 4.2. Sampling for the TSF-SVM learning
The whole walking period of the biped robot is considered to be composed of a SSP and a DSP, the trunk of the robot keeps upright. The supporting foot remains in full contact with the ground during the SSP, and the feet both revolve around the point contacting with the ground during the DSP. The walk cycle is T and let T c  X  1 s. The start phase is DSP, which occupies 20% time of the whole walking cycle. Three different motions are planned: Motion1 (step length is 0.16 m), Motion2 (step length is 0.18 mm) and Motion3 (step length is 0.20 m). The step height is 0.02 m for all the three motions.

The trajectories are represented as follows: x z x z i  X  X  X  1 2 z a i  X  X  X  r 1  X  r 2 d 2 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : where x h and z h represent the position of the hip and x represent the position of the swinging ankle joint. L stride the walking step length, and d denotes the height of swinging ankle. N denotes the total sampling number for a step, i denotes limbs. On the other hand, the feet of the robot revolve around the contacting point on the ground during the double support phase according to the following equation: q  X  q  X  the ground, q heel represents the angle of the left foot revolves ground from time 0, starts to revolve round its toe at time t leaves the ground at time t c , and lands on its heel at time t left foot starts to revolve round its heel from time 0 to t sole of the foot remains in full contact with the ground from time t to t D . 4.3. Parameters for the TSF-SVM and learning results 4.3.1. Parameters for the TSF-SVM
Here, we use m i _ Gaussian shown in Eq. (16) as the fuzzy membership function for the sub-model in the SSP, and m i _ triangular shown in Eq. (13) as the fuzzy membership function for the sub-model in the DSP. In addition, mixed kernels are chosen to be put in the TSF-SVM model. As we know, RBF kernels have significant local quality while polynomial kernels present typical global quality; mixed kernels combine the desirable characteristics of both kinds of kernels.

The hyper-parameters of the proposed TSF-SVM are identified
SVM include the width of the sampling time window t t start  X  1 s, the lower bound of the fuzzy membership func-coefficient of the mixed kernels a  X  0 : 3. 4.3.2. Learning results of the TSF-SVM
Nonlinear dynamic of the two sub-models formulated in Eqs. (12) and (15) are learned using different methods. The proposed
TSF-SVM is compared with other three intelligent methods, including FL, SVM and NN. A horizontal external force is applied was also repeated with the above mentioned force acting on the statistically analyzed here: (ISE) is defined as the measure index: ISE  X  1 N where i denotes the sampling index, N  X  40 is the number of all the desired output. The designing details of the fuzzy control three layered NN including 25 neurons in the hiding layer is built to learn the biped dynamic. The transfer function of the hidden layer is a linear function.
 indicates that the proposed TSF-SVM achieves better learning results. Furthermore, when the external perturbations are increased, the advantage of the proposed TSF-SVM is more that the TSF-SVM considering time properties of the walking samples can learn biped dynamic more accurately. 4.4. Walking control using the learning results proposed method. To imitate the variation of the leg motions caused by disturbances in the SSP, without loss of generality, the 26th sampling point of the supporting hip is designed to deviate from the reference trajectory. On the other hand, the sixth sampling point of the left knee is designed to deviate from the reference trajectory in the DSP. The details can be referenced in Tables 3 and 4 .
 Comparisons of biped walking when disturbances occur in the
SSP are shown in Fig. 6 .In Fig. 6 (a) X (c), the supporting hip deviates from the reference trajectory on the 26th sampling point, the traditional learning control methods output delayed control torques, which leads to the gradual forward lean of the hip and the trunk connected to the hip, the robot tends to fall forward. In Fig. 6 (d), the same deviation emerges and the hip be controlled appropriately to satisfy the ZMP criterion using the proposed learning control method, which keeps the biped balance successfully. Comparisons of biped walking when disturbances in the DSP are similar with those in the SSP. The proposed learning control method is sensitive to the disturbances so that appropriate control torques can be provided when disturbances occur. While traditional learning control methods are insensitive to disturbances because samples coming from the past time lead to delayed learning results, which decreases the stability margin and the robot tends to fall down. Simulations with different step lengths show similar walking trends as discussed above. 5. Conclusions
The biped dynamic satisfying the ZMP criterion should be learned timely and accurately when time-varying external dis-turbances occur, so that appropriate control torques can be provided by the learning control system involved in the occurring disturbances. To address this problem, larger learning weights are assigned to the recent samples which represent the current dynamic, and smaller learning weights are assigned to the old samples which represent the past dynamic. In this way, the old dynamic took place in the past is forgotten gradually, and the new Simulation results demonstrate that using the proposed learning method, the biped dynamic satisfying the ZMP criterion is learned more accurately even occasional external disturbances occur.
We believe that the proposed method will be very promising for learning control of biped walking robots. Future works should include the design of time-sequence-based fuzzy membership Acknowledgments
