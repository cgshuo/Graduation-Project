 Machine Learning research is progressing at an ever-increasing pace. Fueled by technology advances commonly referred to as  X  X ig Data X , all data related fields are teaming with scientific and applied activity: our communities explore new application areas, develop new learning algorithms, and continuously scale and improve optimization and estimation methods. But from an industry perspective, many of the most impeding challenges are entirely elsewhere. This talk takes a fresh look at the practical state of affairs in the context of running a large-scale automated machine learning system that supports 50 Billion decision daily on behalf of hundreds of digital advertisers. Some of the key lessons are 1) robustness beats peak performance almost always, 2) support for the constant dynamic fluctuations in the data stream is essential, 3) models exploiting unknowingly any weakness of your metrics, and finally 4) the fact that despite big data, the data you really want never exists . Claudia Perlich leads the machine learning efforts that power Dstillery X  X  digital intelligence for marketers and media companies. With more than 50 published scientific articles, she is a widely acclaimed expert on big data and machine learning applications, and an active speaker at data science and marketing conferences around the world. Claudia is the past winner of the Advertising Research Foundation X  X  (ARF) Grand Innovation Award and has been selected for Crain X  X  New York X  X  40 Under 40 list, Wired Magazine X  X  Smart List, and Fast Company X  X  100 Mo st Creative People. Claudia holds multiple patents in machine learning. She has won many data mining competitions and awards at Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) conferences, and served as the organization X  X  General Chair in 2014.
