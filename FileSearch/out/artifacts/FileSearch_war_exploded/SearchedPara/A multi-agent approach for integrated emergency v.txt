 1. Introduction
Emergency vehicle fleet management plays an important role in the improvement of the quality of services offered by public organizations like rescue personnel, paramedics, fire protection and police. In real world operation of emergency organizations, when an emergency occurs, a call is received by a specialized emergency center, and the first step is to determine information related to the call like its severity degree and its location; then deciders determine which vehicle must be sent to assist the call.
In this context, the two most important decisions that should be made by emergency vehicle managers are related to the alloca-tion and the covering problems. The allocation problem consists of deciding which vehicle must be assigned to an emergency, in best times. The covering problem aims at keeping the region under surveillance well-covered by relocating available vehicles.
In a recent paper ( Ibri et al., 2009 ), we have developed an optimization model that considers allocation and covering deci-sions jointly. It deals not only with the real time vehicle allocation problem, but it also takes into account simultaneously the cover-age concerns for future demands by relocating and diverting the on-route vehicles and remaining vehicles among stations. Such a model is said to be integrated , and it is motivated by the fact that the allocation and covering decisions are tightly related: as the number of vehicles is limited, dispatching a vehicle to a call makes zones less covered, and thus reduces the possibility of answering properly future calls. It is then intuitively expected that integrating allocation and covering decisions in the same model should improve the system performance on the long range. The value of this integration has been investigated in Ibri et al. (2010) by comparing the integrated model with the non-integrated one. The latter consists in consecutively solving the allocation problem and the covering problem. The allocation decisions are found first, and then used to solve the covering problem. For this comparison, the solution approach was based on a heuristic algorithm combining ant colony optimization and tabu search.

While the method used in Ibri et al. (to appear) is a centralized approach, the solution approach developed in the present paper is rather a decentralized one. In fact, the issue we are investigating is naturally distributed, since it deals with components that are geographically distributed. When solving the corresponding problem in a centralized way, we assume that a central decision maker knows at each instant the locations, the states, and the destinations of all the vehicles for all the zones in the system.
While modern technologies can provide this kind of information, a decentralized solution approach can be sometimes desirable in the context of emergency vehicle fleet management. In fact, such a distributed solution may present the following general advan-tages ( Wooldridge, 2002 ):
They respect the distributed nature of the problem and could make its understanding and implementation easier.

They are more adaptable because the different components of the system have to make less complex decisions. They are in fact able to better control their local environment (vehicles, crews, etc.), and react to changes faster. In contrast, centralized optimization algorithms can be sensitive to information updates: a minor modification in information may have impact on the schedules of many vehicles.

Information integrity for each component of the system may easily be achieved.
 The system is decomposed on independent processing units.
This can increase the computing power considerably, and so the problem solving may be accelerated. In contrast, the time required for the centralized optimization algorithm may not permit timely response to the emergency events when we deal with a large number of vehicles and calls, especially when the supervised region is large and the frequency of arriving calls is high (in case of disasters for example).

Another important matter generally inherent to the centralized architecture is that the failure of the central decision maker will lead to the failure of the whole system, which may have serious consequences in the context of emergencies.

As a distributed solution, multi-agent systems (MAS) have been proposed within the computer science literature. Such systems are composed of multiple interacting intelligent software units (i.e., agents) that are linked to physical or functional entities (e.g., vehicles, calls). Agents are able to act autonomously by pursuing their own interest. Even if each independent agent has only a partial local view of the system, agents may interact with each other, for example using information exchange and negotia-tion mechanisms. The MAS approach seems to be a promising solution for controlling distributed systems, providing more flexibility, reliability, adaptability and reconfigurability. A key issue is how to configure agents such that their behavior yields a near-optimal solution for the system as a whole. In fact, coordination and information exchange between agents are among the central parts that have to be considered to give the distributed approaches strength, in order to reach good perfor-mance for the system.

The idea of MAS is elegant and it has been applied in many real-world contexts, such as computer games, defense systems, mobile technologies, transportation, logistics, etc. However, literature on the application of MAS to deal with emergency vehicle dispatching and covering issues is scarce. In this paper, we develop a multi-agent system to solve the emergency vehicle allocation and covering problem. Then, we investigate how much distributing decision making affects the system performance, by comparing the proposed MAS with the centralized solution.
Finally, we propose and test a coordination mechanism that improves the solution in the distributed context.
 section, we give an overview of related literature. In Section 3 ,we present the centralized optimization model. In Section 4 ,we develop the multi-agent-based solution concept, and we discuss the agents X  interactions and coordination. Experimental results on the proposed multi-agent solution approaches are given in
Sections 5 and 6 concludes the paper. 2. Literature review research presented in this paper. The first class concerns the centralized models and solutions for the allocation and covering problems, whereas the second one is related to the use of multi-agent systems for decentralized decision making. 2.1. Models and solutions for the allocation and covering problems (2003) as a model that minimizes the total travel time in the system. Some simple strategies like the nearest vehicle or the vehicle which was idle for the longest time can also be applied to choose the responder vehicle. In Andersson and Varbrand (2007) , the decision on the vehicle to dispatch is made according to the priority of the call: for the highest priority call, the vehicle with the shortest travel time is dispatched, otherwise the vehicle that affect the least the covering issue is chosen. To avoid making calls with less priority waiting for long time, the authors use pseudo priorities that are incremented when a call is not served in some time limit.
 covering models have been proposed in the literature: static models, probabilistic models, and dynamic models. The most important static models are: the Location Set Covering Model (LSCM) proposed by Toregas et al. (1971) that consists in mini-mizing the number of vehicles to cover all demand points; and the Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP) proposed by
Church and ReVelle (1974) with the aim to maximize population coverage subject to limited vehicle availability. Other static models maximize coverage with several types of vehicles at the same time ( Schilling et al., 1979 ). In Daskin and Stern (1981) , the authors extend the LSCM to the multiple coverage of demand X  nodes. In Hogan and ReVelle (1986) , the authors maximize the number of points covered more than once using hierarchical objectives. In Gendreau et al. (1997) , two coverage standards r 1 o r 2 are used, all the demand points must be covered within r time units and a proportion a of population must be covered within r 1 time units. The static models ignores that when vehicles are dispatched to calls, some points are no longer covered. In probabilistic models randomness is introduced in the availability of vehicles, the service time or the traveling time. For example, in the maximum expected covering location problem ( Daskin, 1983 ), it is assumed that each ambulance has the same prob-ability q of being unavailable to answer a call. Other queuing models have been proposed in the literature to analyze the performance of emergency services at different situations: see for example Chaiken and Larson (1972) . In dynamic models, relocation decisions are periodically made. In Kolesar and Walker (1974) , a relocation system was proposed for fire companies. To meet the real-time requirements of the relocation problem and accelerate the decisions making, the authors in
Gendreau et al. (2001) proposed a dynamic model solved in parallel for real-time ambulance relocation. In Schmid and
Doerner (2010) , the authors proposed a model for the ambulance location and relocation problems that extends the Double
Standard Model (DSM) introduced in Gendreau et al. (1997) to a multi period version. The latter take s into consideration time-depen-dent variations in travel times and coverage areas, and the model is solved using a variable neighborhood search. For more detailed literature on the allocation and covering problems, the reader can be referred to Brotcorne et al. (2003) and Wright et al. (2006) .
The most recent papers focus on the integration of all elements that affect the quality of service in the emergency management systems. In Haghani and Yang (2007) , the authors include traffic forecast services and modern technologies, such as GPS tracking systems, geographic information systems, etc. They propose a simulation model to the management of emergency vehicle fleet.
They emphasized the integration and exchange of information across public safety and transportation agencies, and coordinated the activities of three public safety services, namely fire protec-tion agencies, police and paramedic services. In Ibri et al. (2009) , we have developed a centralized model integrating covering and dispatching issues, and proposed a parallel algorithm combining ant colony optimization and tabu search to solve this model in a centralized way. In Ibri et al. (to appear) , we have investigated the benefit of integrating dispatching and covering decisions. 2.2. Multi-agent systems for decentralized decision making
The literature of multi-agent and decentralized decision making related to this work can be presented in three main bodies: the multi-agent systems applied to production and transport, the auction protocols for decentralized decision making and a small body of papers devoted to the use of MAS for emergency vehicle management. Many papers in the domain of multi-agent production and transport were done in the last decade. We will present here some of these papers. In
Davidsson et al. (2008) , the authors presented a transport chain decision support system based on a multi-agent approach. The proposed system helps companies to make strategic, tactical and operational decisions, like to decide where to locate terminals and storages, to adapt the vehicle fleet, the frequency of deliveries, etc. The system in Davidsson et al. (2008) is composed of two layers: the first one is the set of all passive agents, like vehicles and products; and the second contains pro-active agents that determine the actions of the first layer. Other papers focused on comparing and combining centralized and distributed solutions.
For example, in Greer et al. (2008) the authors developed a distributed agent based algorithm for a generic production scheduling system called PEGS (Production and Environmental
Generic Scheduler), and compared the results with the original centralized algorithm. They concluded that when flexibility and speed are more important than the solution optimality, it would be a good option to use an agent based approach. Bohnlein et al. (2011) , the authors described a multi-agent based solution concept, and a software tool for the online optimization of transport processes considering production schedules applied to the news-paper industry. Compared to centralized solutions, they get promis-ing results in terms of the service level, as well as the number of vehicles in use. In Mes et al. (2007) the authors considered the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, and proposed a market based mechanism for the allocation of vehicles to transport orders. The agent based solution was compared with two hierarch-ical methods that require all orders and vehicle information to be available, and a central vehicle plan to be constructed. The obtained results show that the proposed agent based approach gives high performance in terms of vehicle utilizations and service level. In Davidsson et al. (2007) the authors X  aim was to find a hybrid approach that takes advantage fr om the complementarities of the agent based and the optimization techniques, to solve the planning and allocation of resources in combined production and transporta-tion within the food industry. They investigated two ways for combining the two approaches. The first one consists of embedding optimization in a multi-agent system, where each agent solves a partial linear program. The second one is a tactical/operational hybrid approach that uses a coordinating agent to solve a linear program (LP) producing a global plan; this latter approach is used by the other agents to make future decisions by solving a local LP. The obtained results have shown that the two hybrid approaches appear to combine some of the good properties from each of the two investigated methods.

On the other hand, auction protocols have played an important role in the context of MAS and decentralized decision making. The use of auction mechanisms was widely discussed for the assign-ment problem in Bertsekas (1991) , which contains the most important works on auctions algorithms for linear programming in general. In Wellman (1993) the author applied a market price system for decentralized decision making to a multi-commodity flow problem; he showed that a careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient distributed resource allocation with minimal commu-nication. In Wellman et al. (2001) the authors investigated auction mechanisms and bidding protocols for some general classes of distributed scheduling problems. They introduced an additional market in combination with basic goods to deal with cases of non-existence of price equilibrium.

Finally, we view our decentralized solution approach as an outgrowth of the small body of literature devoted to the use of MAS to deal with emergency vehicle dispatching and covering issues. In Lopez et al. (2008) , the authors used a MAS with the contract net protocol to select the ambulance to transport a patient. They included a driver trust agent that indicates to the coordinator to what extent the estimated travel time given by the drivers is true, using historical driving data. In Lopez et al. (2005) , the authors presented a multi-agent system to support the diagnosis of acute stroke diseases by coordinating ambulance services, and expert neurologists to attend the patient in time. They used an auction mechanism based on trust to coordinate the ambulances. 2.3. Contribution of the paper
From the above literature review, we remark that most existing papers related to the emergency vehicle management deal with the allocation and covering issues separately and in a centralized way. The model used in this paper considers alloca-tion and covering decisions jointly.

This integrated model has been proposed in Ibri et al. (2009 , 2010 ), where a parallel ant-tabu heuristic is developed as a centralized solution approach. The work in Ibri et al. (to appear) is devoted to the evaluation of the value of integrating dispatch-ing and covering decisions.

The main contribution of the present paper consists in devel-oping a decentralized distributed solution approach based on MAS. To our knowledge, there is no existing work that uses MAS for real-time emergency vehicle allocation problem while accounting for the coverage requirements for future demands. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent architecture that fits the real emergency systems, and that aims at keeping good perfor-mance compared to a centralized solution. For this purpose, we investigate two multi-agent approaches. The first approach consists of a two-step decision process that deals with the allocation and the covering problems consecutively, and where data and control are distributed with limited interactions between agents. The second approach is based on implicit agents X  coordination using a more refined and efficient auction mechan-ism. Before detailing these approaches, the centralized mathema-tical model is first presented in the next section. 3. Mathematical model
In the centralized version of the system that will be called  X  DISCOV  X , we consider that all the emergency calls are directed to the same center responsible to control the entire region. The region is composed of a number of zones from where calls arrive, and stations where vehicles are located. The calls are character-ized by their locations 1 (each call belongs to a zone) and their severity degrees, which define their priority. A call has also an estimated handling time during which the assigned vehicle will be busy.

Stations are used to keep idle vehicles and are characterized by their locations. We consider a homogeneous vehicle fleet, and each call needs only one vehicle. All vehicles at stations are considered idle, when a vehicle arrives to the emergency location it becomes busy and cannot be assigned to another call until it finishes. However, when it is on route to a call/station, it may be reoriented if this decision improves the system X  X  performance.
 need of covering, and has a center point that allows us to compute the traveling time between the vehicles and this zone; thus, we can measure its prepardness and decide if the zone is covered.
A zone is covered if it prepardness is greater than some para-meter j .
 ing problems are of three levels: the strategic, the tactical and the operational levels. The one we deal with in this work is of the operational level and we consider that the determination of the need of a zone and the required coverage are related to the tactical level. For the problem instances considered in this paper, preliminary tests are run to fix the values of C z and j , such as a good coverage is ensured (as it could be anticipated by a tactical plan). For example, when the number of ambulances is small, the value of the pre-specified value of j will be small enough to ensure sufficient coverage.

The objective function to minimize is the sum of the traveling time to prioritized emergency calls, the traveling time to stations, the number of unsatisfied calls multiplied by penalty 1, the number of uncovered zones multiplied by penalty 2, and the number of deviated vehicles multiplied by penalty 3. The three penalties give the managers the possibility to control the relative importance of call satisfaction, zone coverage and vehicle devia-tion according to the situation with which they have to deal. The values of these three penalty parameters are determined in this paper based on an experimental sensitivity analysis considering trade-offs between the average performances. The mathematical model is as follows: MIN :  X  Penal 1 Subject to

The first constraint (C1) states that each vehicle should be assigned to one and only one place (emergency or station) at a time. Constraint (C2) states that each call is assigned to at most one vehicle. (C3) serves to determine if an emergency is satisfied or not. Constraint (C4) and (C5) determines if a zone is covered or not. Constraints (C6) X (C8) control the vehicles X  deviation. They allow only the deviations that bring in a gain higher than a pre-specified parameter t . 4. The multi-agent dispatching and covering system  X  X  X A-DISCOV X  X 
The DISCOV system is a set of geographically distributed entities that have to interact, cooperate and coordinate to assist emergency calls as quickly as possible. In this section, we describe a distributed approach for the DISCOV system. It is a multi-agent architecture ( Fig. 1 ) that represents better real world emergency systems. The proposed multi-agent dispatching and covering system will be called  X  X  X A-DISCOV X  X . In Fig. 1 , an emergency call agent is on the responsibility of a zone agent. This latter has to interact with station agents to find an appropriate vehicle, in order to respond to the call agent. On the other side, a vehicle agent belongs to a station agent. If need be, a station agent communicates with its own vehicles to collect information and make appropriate decisions.

Each emergency call is operated by a call agent who has the responsibility of contacting its zone agent to request an emergency vehicle. The request contains the call location and its priority. The zone agent sends to it an estimated arriving time of the vehicle as a response for its request.
 Zone Agent  X  X  ZA  X  X 
A zone agent has the role of receiving the requests from the emergency call agents, and transmitting the requests to the stations. When it receives proposals from stations, it decides which offer to accept, and sends the chosen proposal back to the call agent.
 Station Agent  X  X  SA  X  X 
When a station agent receives a request from a zone agent, it contacts its vehicle agents (if necessary, it also contacts the zone agents to get information related to their prepardness), and sends a proposal to the zone agent. If the proposal is accepted, it informs the concerned vehicle, and sends reject to the others. At the end of a call service, the station has also the role of directing the concerned vehicle to the destination that improves the system performance.
 Vehicle Agent  X  X  VA  X  X 
This agent acts under its station agent control. Mainly, it informs the station agent about the estimated traveling time from its current position to other locations (a call/station location). When it finishes assisting some call, it sends a request to its station agent to know at which destination he should go. The vehicle agent should also inform the station about its arrival to the destination call/station. 4.2. Interactions and coordination
As described by Fig. 2 , when an emergency call arrives, an interaction is established between the call zone and the station agents, to determine which vehicle to assign to the call.
 involves some rigor because of the decentralized nature of data and computation. In the case of the MA-DISCOV system, integrat-ing the dispatching and covering problems makes switching from centralized to distributed solution less obvious. In fact, since each station agent has access only to the information related to its vehicles, the decision it makes is local. As a result of such configuration each station will choose one of its own vehicles to assign to the call, and if necessary will relocate the remaining of its own vehicles to retrieve the zones X  covering. Without commu-nication and coordination, this process may lead to a chaotic situation because the decisions made locally may be conflicting or at least not optimal globally.
 need to coordinate station agents that are the first responsible of decision making, without assigning the role of coordinator to any of them and without a complete inter-agents communication. For this purpose we propose two methods called Approach 1 and
Approach 2. 4.2.1. Approach 1 priority than the first one. But to avoid penalizing the same call continuously, we increment its priority at each time until it reaches the higher priority.

In the second step, the station, whose vehicle was accepted, checks if the coverage of the zones was affected by the assignment of the first step. In this case, its starts a recovery procedure: To restore coverage, a station S i sends a Call For Proposal: CFP (recovery) to all stations S j : j a i . When a station
S receives a CFP(recovery), it forwards it to its vehicles agents and receives from them proposals containing the estimated travel time to station S i . It computes the gain of the number of covered zones for each vehicle, chooses the best proposal and sends it back to S i including the corresponding travel time and the earned number of covered zones. Station S i selects the best one, then sends an Accept message to the selected one and Refuse message to the others.

In the selection procedure, only the proposals with positive gain are considered. The proposal with the maximum gain is selected. If several ones have the same maximum gain, the one with the shortest travel time is chosen. 4.2.2. Approach 2
In this approach, the agents in the system deal with the dispatching and covering decisions in one step using an auction mechanism.

Note that the main issue of our work is to find a way to distribute data and computation so that the quality of the distributed solution is good compared to the centralized one.
For this reason we consider that the evaluation performed at each station is local since it uses only local data (to evaluate for example unsat, uncov and dev). But using the proposed bidding process at the zone agent, we try to emerge global solutions that are comparable to the centralized ones.

In this auction mechanism the zone agent plays the auctioneer role and the vehicles are the bidders. Each vehicle agent is represented by its station agent. When a station agent  X  X  X A receives a CFP from a zone it asks its own vehicles  X  X  V (SA estimated time from their current position to all the locations ( W [ S ), then it computes the local fitness value for each couple (vehicle, location) as follows.

Let ( i , l ) be the couple of the i th vehicle A V (SA k location A W [ S .
 Exp1  X  Penal 1 Exp2  X  Penal 2 Exp3  X  Penal 3 f itness  X  i , l  X  X 
Each vehicle bids for the best location. The value of the bid is equal to the difference between the fitness value of the best and the second best locations. By selecting the large difference between the two best fitness, we favor the assignments that may cost much (in term of fitness) when they are not chosen.
On the other hand, the zone agent assigns emergency call to the best bidder (with the minimal bid value since the bids are negative). If a vehicle agent bids for a station location, its bid is accepted. Vehicles agents are assigned to their second best locations, if their bid for a call is refused.

If the second best location of a vehicle is another emergency to which another vehicle has already been assigned we take the third position as a bid with a value equals to the difference between the 2nd and the 3rd best fitness. We continue in this way until all the vehicles will be assigned.
 Request 5. Experimental results The proposed multi-agent system was implemented using
JADE  X  X  X ava Agent Development Environment X  X  platform. It was encoded as a discrete time event based simulator in Java programming language. The different events of the simulator ( new call , arrival to call / station and end of call service ) are scheduled according to the instance data, and to the estimated traveling time given by the MapPoint Tool: we schedule the event of a new call according to its arrival time. When it arrives, and after deciding which vehicle to send, we use the estimated travel time given by the MapPoint tool to schedule the vehicle arrival event. When this later occurs, we use the service time of the call to know at what time the vehicle will finish its service. The end of the service is also an event in the simulator for which we decide the next destination of the vehicle in consideration.
A set of benchmark instances were prepared for the new problem considered in this paper. All data (emergency calls, stations, and zones) correspond to real addresses and are geo-localized on a real map (Switzerland map) with real street network. Geo-localization, itinerary, distances and travel times are computed using the MapPoint tool. Each instance is composed of a:  X  Set of vehicles, each one has a station as initial position.  X  Set of stations, a station is characterized by its position on the map.  X  Set of zones, each one has a position on the map (the center of the zone), and a value representing its demand (number of calls possibly coming from this zone) that serves to compute the prepardness.  X  Set of calls, each one is characterized by its position on the map, the zone to which it belongs, its priority, arrival time and service time.

Based on the study of Haghani and Yang (2007) performed on real data, we considered that the inter-arrival time of emergency calls which is the time between two successive emergency calls follows an exponential distribution with an average inter-arrival time of 30 min, and the service times of emergency calls follow a normal distribution. Experiments have been conducted on two data sets with the same instances, but that differ on the average inter-arrival times. They have respectively values of 30 and 15 min.
 the MA-DISCOV system on the different instances. We compare
Approach 1 with Approach 2, and both with the centralized solution. The later was obtained by solving the model in Section 3 using the IBM ILOG CPLEX version 12.2 solver that we integrated to our simulator. The comparison will be based on the average of the fitness function. To conclude on the service quality, the average response time and the zone coverage will also be compared. 5.1. Fitness function obtained along the simulation process. The fitness value is the value of the objective function described in Section 3 . It is true that in the proposed distributed system there is no entity that has the complete information to compute this value, but since our purpose is to know to what extent the proposed distributed approaches are good compared to the centralized one, we added in our implementation a code that calculates the objective function value of the obtained distributed solution and we used this value in the comparison of this section.
 this measure is given in Figs. 3 and 4 , where two datasets (dataset 1 and dataset 2) are used. This comparison shows that for both datasets Approach 1 gives less efficient results for almost all instances. Approach 2 improves significantly the solution quality.
The average difference between Approach 1 and the centralized solution is 48.60% for dataset 1 and 37.5% for dataset 2. Approach 2 reduces the difference to 12.91% for dataset 1 and to 12.37% for dataset 2.
 5.2. Average response time
From Fig. 5 , we remark that Approach 1 is less efficient in response time for both datasets. Fig. 6 shows that Approach 2 performs better than the centralized solution for many instances especially for dataset 2. The difference of the objective function value between approach 2 and the centralized system accounts for the difference of the response time: while optimiz-ing the objective function of the model, the centralized solution gives in some cases better coverage and longer response times, whereas approach 2 is not able to reach the same performance (in term of objective function values) and gives in general solutions with better response times and lower coverage quality.
 5.3. Zone coverage
As described in Section 3 , a zone is considered uncovered if its prepardness measure is less than j . To measure the covering property of the zones we use two criteria. The first one is the percentage of uncovered zones during all the simulation process, the second criterion is the percentage of the average time a zone stays uncovered. It is the average time of uncovering by the total simulation time. In Tables 1 and 2 , the obtained results are presented for dataset 1 and dataset 2, respectively.

To summarize the results in Tables 1 and 2 we give the average values of each measure ( Table 3 ). The difference between the three methods is not very important for the coverage issue. We note however slightly worse results of Approach 1 for dataset 2 and of Approach 2 for dataset 1.
 implies both dispatching and covering issues, decentralizing data and computation is not a straightforward matter since the two issues are very related to each other and some decisions, like deviating vehicles, are made based on the global state of the system. From the experimental results, we deduce that for our centralized algorithm, decentralizing data and decision making may affect greatly the solution quality (Approach 1) when we rely only on the local decisions made by agents separately. In
Approach 2 all the assignments are made by a global implicit coordination mechanism that improves significantly the fitness value, and makes it close to the centralized one while keeping good quality of service. 6. Conclusion
In this paper we proposed a distributed solution to the integrated dispatching and covering problem for the emergency vehicle management system. The proposed solution is a multi-agent system that fits better real emergency organizations. To show how much distribution may affect the solution quality when coordination is not effective, we developed an approach that distributes data and control with very little inter-agent interaction; then, we investigated another approach based on an auction mechanism that coordinate agents implicitly. The obtained results show that the second approach is much better than the first one, and its performance is very close to the centralized solution, while allowing for better quality of service.
These results endorse previous works to conclude about the importance of the quality of inter-agents X  coordination to reach good performances in systems where data and decision making are distributed.
 Future work should consider the deployment of the MAS-
DISCOV on a real organization, and investigate other explicit structured methods for coordinating agents in order to improve the system performance.
