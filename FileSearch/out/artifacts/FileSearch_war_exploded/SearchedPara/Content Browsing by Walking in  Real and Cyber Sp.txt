 manipulating methods are mainly restricted to interfaces of a computer, e.g. a graphi-cal user interface with a mouse and a keyboard. This limitation makes browsing con-feel lost easily, and browsing 3D content with a mouse and menus is quite difficult. and as casual as physical movement and looking around. In this paper, we introduce browsing Web pages and automatic viewpoint control for comparing 3D content. EnergyBrowser is a web browser that renders web pages incrementally in proportion to the amount of walking/jogging the user has done.

Next, EnergyBrowser analyzes the page and displays its background image. At the same time, EnergyBrowser converts the page into the for-mat that is preferable for incremental rendering, for example, eliminating unnecessary frames and enlarging font sizes, if needed. After that, EnergyBrowser renders a frag-ment of the body of the page. The size of the fragment is proportional to the amount playing fragment exceeds the size of the display area. Figure 2 shows an example of Browser selects the next target page. 
There are many web browsers for looking at web pages on the World Wide Web, but they only render pages as they are. In contrast, EnergyBrowser proceeds rendering browser is very enjoyable and is a novel experience. As for 3D content, many digital archives of ruins and restoration by 3D CG have been created. However, only looking at the conten t is not enough. The user needs to under-stand. Systems that support the user X  X  understanding of content are therefore required. 
An effective method of helping understanding is comparison. However, comparing because the user has to operate their viewpoints separately. viewing.

Thus, the user can walkthrough 3D archives freely, and the system provides compara-tive views of other related content, such as restorations. We illustrated physical and virtual walking interfaces for browsing content. Our pub-lic demonstration showed they are intuitive and popular, especially with children. 
The current interface of a comparative 3D archive browser is a keyboard or game controller, but a real walking interface can be imported, such as the one used in Ener-gyBrowser. Though this combination is similar to the system pr oposed by Kadobaya-into 3D space.
