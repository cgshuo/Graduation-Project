 1. Introduction
New technologies, such as Semantic Web (SW) technologies, are usually subjected to experimentation, refinement, and increasingly realistic and exhaustive testing. This kind of information gathering, which aims to look beyond the immediately obvious and at analysing the ramifications of a given technology in as wide-ranging and far-sighted a manner as possible, is known as technology assessment ( Braun, 1998 ). Technology assessment is usually based on different forecasting methods including extrapolation, expert opinion (the Delphi method) and modelling, cost-benefit analysis, cross-impact analysis, and others.
 The term  X  X  X emantic Web X  X  refers to the World Wide Web Consortium X  X  vision of the Web of linked data (called also the
Web of Data) as  X  X  ... an extension of the current Web in which information is given a well-defined meaning, better enabling ization organizations (associations or consortia) relevant for assessment of information technologies such as IEEE-SA (see The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association, http://standards.ieee.org/ ), OASIS (see The Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards, http://www.oasis-open.org/ ), OMG (see The Object Management Group, http://www.omg.org/ ) and W3C (see The World Wide Web Consortium, http://www.w3.org/ ).

In order to determine the achievements in the Semantic Web field, especially its maturity status and the adoption of these technologies by the industry, as well as to predict the future development of SW technologies, we have studied and analyzed a substantial amount of various sources. These range from deliverables from projects financed by the European Commission within its 6th and 7th Framework Programmes (EC FP6 + FP7), through scientific papers from prestigious international jour-nals and conferences, Semantic Web technologies and tools from the industry top vendors and open source communities  X  ( Janev, 2008 ), to Web resources of the W3C standardization body. This paper clarifies the applicability of Semantic Web tech-nologies and identifies the major trends in the Semantic Web field, both from researchers X  point of view and from the per-spective of early adopters.

The article is organized as follows. After identifying the work related to Semantic Web technologies assessment in Sec-tion 2 , we point to existing and emerging SW standards and discuss their adoption for developing new applications and for meeting different technical and application challenges. Using the W3C collection of Case Studies and Use Cases, we infer rela-tions between the SW technologies and the gained benefits. Section 4 considers the state-of-the-art of SW technologies from several viewpoints such as development of SW languages, availability of data, content and ontologies on the Semantic Web, data and service integration, while in Section 5 we point to open issues such as stability of SW languages, interoperability issues, and scalability of SW applications. 2. Related work to Semantic Web technologies assessment
In literature and in practice, SW tools and technologies are named by using different keywords: ontology design/manage-ment/maintenance tools, semantic data management and integration platforms ( Ahmad &amp; Colomb, 2007 ), RDF triple storage systems, web services, SOA middleware platforms, semantic annotation tools ( Reeve &amp; Han, 2005 ), content indexing and cat-egorization tools, semantic search and information retrieval technologies ( Andrews, 2009; Crestani, Lalmas, Van Rijsbergen, &amp; Campbell, 1998; Mangold, 2007 ), NLP, linguistic analysis and text mining algorithms, collaboration and other social net-technologies, ontology mediated portals, ontological querying/inference engines, rule-based engines, ontology learning methods ( G X mez-P X rez &amp; Manzano-Macho, 2003 ), ontology reasoners, etc. Exploring the business value of semantic technol-ogies provided by 50 commercial companies ( Davis, Allemang, &amp; Coyne, 2004 ) identified the following four major functions: the functionalities of more than 50 SW tools (see the Web4WeB repository of the Sixth Framework Program  X  X  X eb Technol-ogies for the West Balkan Countries X  X , at www.web4web.org/portal/Semantic_Web_Tools ) provided by 30 different commer-cial vendors and open source communities, Janev and Vrane X  ( Janev, 2008 ) established the following classification of key semantic technology segments: semantic modelling and development, semantic annotation, semantic data management and integration, semantic search and retrieval, semantic collaboration including portal technologies, learning and reasoning.
According to this analysis, vendors have made recognizable progress towards the specification and acceptance of semantic standards, but still lack efficient reasoning support which is crucial for realization of the Semantic Web vision.
The literature review has showed that most of the scientific studies usually analyze a single aspect of semantic technol-2005; Cardoso, 2007; d X  X quin et al., 2008 ) or investigate the adoption of semantic technologies in various scientific and industrial domains. While some surveys take an industrial economic approach towards semantic technologies ( Davis

The analysis indicated that  X  X  X he expectations in Semantic Web technologies were very high in both groups. Generally both groups believe that organizational culture is not yet ready for the Semantic Web. Additionally, application-oriented partic-ipants believe that Semantic Web technologies are too complex. On the contrary, research-oriented participants believe that mentation and the general heterogeneity of information are the biggest obstacles to the application of Semantic Web technologies. X  X  3. Analysis of the W3C collection of Case Studies and Use Cases 3.1. Semantic Web standards In the time since the SW X  X  initial conception ( Berners-Lee et al., 2001 ), the Semantic Web Activity Group of the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has accepted numerous Web technologies as standards or recommendations. In an attempt to structure and relate these technologies, Tim Berners-Lee presented several versions of the SW architecture that layered them into a so-called stack of increasingly expressive languages for metadata specification ( www.w3.org/2001/sw/ ). To rep-resent information on the Web in the form of a graph, the SW uses the Resource Description Framework (RDF) as a general X  purpose language. To ensure interoperability between applications that exchange machine-understandable information, RDF describes information in terms of objects (resources) and the relations between them via the RDF Schema, which serves as a meta-language or vocabulary to define properties and classes of RDF resources. To avoid ambiguity, the RDF Schema uses uniform resource identifier (URI) references for naming. Furthermore, since every Semantic Web resource has a unique
URI, it is possible to establish links among existing models, re-use existing models and build new models upon them, thus creating a network of ontologies and enabling development of large-scale Semantic Web applications.

After standardizing RDF and the ontology layer (OWL), the SW research community X  X  primary efforts in the past few years have been focused on standardizing technologies for SW services and provisioning technologies and tools that enhance inter-operability and availability of content on the Semantic Web. This latter effort involves the development of rule languages, rule exchange languages, and engines that enhance reasoning, improvement of ontology languages, invention of new knowl-edge representation formalisms and elaboration of methods and tools for publishing linked data on the Web ( Bizer, Heath, &amp; Berners-Lee, 2009 ). Table 1 surveys the maturity status of technologies that were closely investigated in this research.
To summarize, some of the key benefits of ontology languages that are usually declarative compared to procedural lan-guages include re-use and interoperability of models, flexibility in open and dynamic systems, consistency and quality checking across models. 3.2. The W3C collection of Semantic Web Case Studies and Use Cases
Most of the existing survey studies are descriptive and do not provide any empirical data about the usability of semantic technologies in different application domains, or data about the achieved benefits. This was the reason for choosing the W3C collection of Semantic Web Case Studies and Use Cases to find relationships between variables such as the enterprise area of activities, the application area of SW technologies, the SW technologies used, and the benefits of SW technologies. Retrieved from http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/sweo/public/UseCases/ on August 11, 2010, the collection includes 29 descriptions of sys-tems used within a production environment (Case studies) and 13 examples of built prototype systems (Use cases). The em-ployed method was cross-tabulation , also known as contingency table analysis which is often adopted for exploring categorical (nominal measurement scale) survey data. A cross-tabulation is a two-(or more) dimensional table that records the fre-quency of respondents with the specific characteristics described in the table cells. Our primary objective was to identify the application areas as well as W3C SW technologies applied in a particular application domain and to indicate the benefits end-user organizations gain by utilizing SW technologies. 3.3. Application areas of the Semantic Web technologies
The scientific literature lacks a survey analysis of business applications of semantic technologies. In a technology assess-ment report based on findings from 35 semantic technology early adopters from many different verticals ( Davis et al., 2004 ), the authors have identified the following application areas: infrastructure and integration, managing risk, customer-facing services, output management, smart products and services, design and manufacture, research, input management, supplier facing processes, intelligence and security. Analyzing the time to mainstream adoption of semantic technologies in different business applications from practitioners X  point of view, European researchers ( Cuel et al., 2007 ) found that the most mature business application areas were bioinformatics, knowledge management and e-learning. Business areas with less than 5 years of mainstream adoption were B2B (Business-to-Business) and B2C (Business-to-Customer), while the duration to mainstream adoption for e-government applications was estimated to be more than five years. Looking at the business areas of early adopters registered in the W3C collection of Semantic Web Case Studies and Use Cases, we found that 36% of the early adopters were public institutions and that 47% of them implemented e-government principles using semantic technol-ogies. Further, 12% of them were applications in the health sector and exactly the same share had the applications in the IT industry, and then follow with less than 10% the applications in the telecommunications sector, life sciences (pharmaceutical industry), broadcasting services and library services, while only 2% were finance applications ( Table 2 ).
Analyzing the W3C collection of Semantic Web Case Studies and Use Cases and looking at the technical problems solved by using semantic technologies we have compiled a list of the most mature application areas of semantic technologies, pre-sented in Table 3 Semantic technologies are by far most often used for data integration and for improving the search. How-ever, according to these statistics, they have untapped potential for dynamic customization/composition of services and, hence, for building flexible architectures.
 Table 4 establishes relationships between the most frequently used Semantic Web technologies and application domains.
The first column shows the number of items (SW applications) that use one specific technology, while the second column indicates the coverage percentages. This distribution shows that most of the applications (81%) are based on RDF(S) and half of them use OWL models for knowledge representation. This can be explained with the expressivity/performance trade-off (see Table 1 . Complexity of Tractable Fragments on the following Web site http://www.w3.org/Submission/2006/
SUBM-owl11-tractable-20061219/ ). OWL models are more expressive, and hence require more sophisticated reasoning algo-rithms (e.g. Concept Subsumption or Instance Checking in RDFS is PTIME while in OWL DL is NEXPTIME complete). In order to achieve better performance, developers tend to use less expressive languages and languages that are not purely declara-and one tenth of which use the SKOS standard for representing and publishing classification schemes, thesauri, and controlled vocabularies as RDF graphs. It is interesting to note that investigation of the use of the SPARQL standard query language for RDF shows that it is more often used for data integration, i.e. for syntactic matching of different knowledge schemas, than for querying and retrieval. The search and content discovery functions rely on the public and in-house vocab-ularies, as well as on the SKOS models that, similarly to Knowledge Organization Systems in library and information sciences, are very suitable for retrieval and navigation tasks. Considering the use of rule languages, we can conclude that they are used in just a small number of applications in public institutions, health care and IT. It is encouraging to observe, however, that, besides the mature SW technologies (RDF and OWL), technologies such as OWL-S and WSMO that are still in the process of standardization are being considered for service integration. 3.4. Benefits from utilizing Semantic Web technologies
Looking at the W3C Early Adopter collection and analysing the reported benefits from utilizing Semantic Web technolo-gies, we have found out that the companies achieved data share and re-use (57%), improved search (57%), incremental mod-elling (26%), explicit content relation (24%), identifying new relationships (17%), dynamic content generation (14%), personalization (10%), open model (12%), rapid response to change (10%), reduced time to market (5%), and automation (5%).
In order to provide further evidence which links SW technologies with gained benefits, we have analyzed two subsets of case studies: (I) a set of entries (25 out of 42) whose main application was  X  X  X earch and content discovery X  X  and (II) a set of entries (30 out of 42) whose main application was  X  X  X ata integration X  X . Both sets count 39 out of 42 or 93% of all entries. The results of the analysis are summarized in Fig. 1 , where the left-hand-side illustrates the applied SW technologies in realiza-
The results can be interpreted as follows. In the whole W3C dataset, 14% of  X  X  X ata integration X  X  solutions use rule languages, hence rule languages are more suitable for data integration than for implementing the search function. Both subsets show that SW technologies are very suitable for data sharing and reusing (reported by 67% of applications in the second dataset), as well as for knowledge search (reported by 84% of applications in the first dataset). Using semantic annotation and auto-matic ontology learning techniques, unstructured text documents can be processed and semantic relations extracted, thus making the content relationships explicit (reported by 12 X 27% of applications) and, hence, machine-processable. Design based on public vocabularies and public datasets leads to open model architectures that enhance interoperability. Faceted navigation techniques and semantic relations shorten the search time, improve the relevance of search results, and deliver high-quality search services. Reasoning services can be used to identify new relationships (reported by 20 X 24% of applica-tions) and dynamic content generation (reported by 20% of applications).

State-of-the-art in the Semantic Web research in the European Union The EU framework programmes ( http://cordis.europa.eu/ )  X  together with EUREKA (A Europe-wide Network for Market-Oriented R&amp;D and Innovation, http://www.eurekanetwork.org/ ) and COST (an intergovernmental framework for European

Using the established classification of Semantic Web technologies X  application domains (see Table 3 ), herein, we present the results of the analysis of the main contributions of European research community to the Semantic Web development. As an entry point for this survey we have used the Web4WeB repository of EU funded Semantic Web related projects ( http:// www.web4web.org/portal/Research_Projects ), that besides the basic information provides links to the organizations in-volved in these projects and mirrors the most important  X  X  X esearch X  X ,  X  X  X ndustry X  X  and  X  X  X ducation X  X  deliverables. At present, the knowledge base stores information about 58 projects including REWERSE, KnowledgeWeb, SUPER, NeOn, DIP, NEPO-MUK, TRIPCOM, SWING, TAO, SemanticGov, Service Web 3.0, ACTIVE, INSEMTIVES, LarKC, OKKAM, KIWI, LarKC, SOA4ALL,
IKS, MATURE, SEALS and others. 4.1. SW methodologies
Ontology building exhibits a structural and logical complexity comparable to the production of software artifacts. Most mature methodologies, i.e. methodologies with the greatest adoption among ontologists are those developed fifteen years ago such as Methontology (13.7%), followed by On-To-Knowledge methodology (7.4%), and Mike Uschold and Martin King X  X  method (4.2%) ( Cardoso, 2007 ). These methodologies aimat building corporate semantic applications. Our analysis of meth-odologies used in recently terminated and ongoing EU FP6 and FP7 projects indicated that each project developed its own methodology. The evaluation of the SUPER Semantic Business Process Management Methodology ( Fantini et al., 2007 ) for example, showed that  X  X  X he methodology is almost complete and accepted as a general guideline and that problem areas are mainly related to the current tool support along the whole SBPM lifecycle X  X  (SUPER, http://www.ip-super.org/res/
Deliverables/M18/D2.3.pdf ). Therefore, we conclude that unlike conventional software development, in which most methodologies have matured and are usually facilitated by well-defined modelling languages and computer-aided software engineering tools, SW methodologies (especially the ones for development of large scale applications) are still in their inception phase. The most promising methodologies and tools for large scale applications were delivered or are still under development in the framework of the SemanticGov, NeOn, TripCom, LarKC and other projects. 4.2. Development of SW languages
Our analysis of semantic languages and formalisms leveraged in European research projects has revealed several impor-tant insights. The research efforts in this field have been focused on the development of many existing SW languages, espe-cially to WSMO, WSML, RIF, and SAWSDL, within the framework of the Data, Information, and Process Integration with
Semantic Web Services project (DIP, http://projects.kmi.open.ac.uk/dip/ ) and REWERSE Rule Markup Language (R2ML) with-in the framework of Reasoning on the Web with Rules and Semantics project (REWERSE, http://rewerse.net/ ). It has been also revealed that besides RDFS and OWL, researchers tend to use WSML and its variants that differ in expressiveness as well as in their underlying logical formalism (Description Logics, Logic Programming, First-Order Logic or F-Logic). In the framework of the TripCom project, which aimed to further develop the machine-to-machine Web service communication, researchers have proposed a new Triple Reasoning and Rule Entailment Engine language (TRREE, http://www.tripcom.org/docs/del/
D2.3.pdf ) while software developers have integrated it into the existing OWLIM semantic repositories (see http://www. ontotext.com/owlim/ ). In the framework of the LarKC project ( http://www.larkc.eu ), which has the objective to develop a platform for Web-scale reasoning, researchers propose more lightweight representation formalism (e.g., the L2 language in Fischer, Unel, Bishop, and Fensel (2010) ) that takes into consideration the expressivity, complexity, and practical feasibility of current knowledge representation languages, as well as to further elaborate the Continuous SPARQL (or simply networked ontologies project (NeOn, http://www.neon-project.org/ ), researchers have developed new formalisms for dis-tributed knowledge representation and reasoning, e.g. the Integrated Distributed Description Logics (IDDL, http:// www.neon-project.org/web-content/images/Publications/neon_2009_d144.pdf ); implemented new ontology modulariza-tion tools; suggested new approach for efficient reasoning with large data volumes and conjunctive query answering with
PTIME Data Complexity, and others. 4.3. Data integration, service integration and publishing linked data on the Web
Ontologies are the backbone of the Semantic Web, a semantic-aware version of the World Wide Web. Together with com-monly used vocabularies, they provide reference models for data and process integration as well as knowledge sharing be-tween systems and people in ways that facilitate machine reasoning and inference. The European Commission X  X  FP6 and FP7 projects have produced and made publicly available many high-quality domain ontologies in areas such as life science, busi-ness organization, e-government, and so on. Considering the most often used languages and formalisms for building ontol-ogies, we found out that some business process and geo-spatial ontologies were based on the WSML-Flight knowledge representation language; TripCom X  X  Triple Space Ontology has three variants (RDFS, OWL-Lite, and WSML-Flight); and the
NeOn project chose the Meta Object Facility (MOF) as a model-driven integration framework for definition, manipulation, and integration of modules of the Networked Ontology Metamodel. The Networked Ontology Metamodel can be grounded on OWL, SWRL, F-logic, and other ontology languages.

As our analysis previously showed, ontology-based approaches to data and service integration have already been well established in corporate settings. During the last five years, research efforts have been dedicated to extending the conven-tional Web, and making the existing content available on the Semantic Web as well. Aimed at publishing structured data in the RDF format there have been several open community projects coordinated by EU experts such as DBpedia ( http://dbpe-dia.org/ ), Semantic Web Dog Food ( http://data.semanticweb.org/ ) and SensorMasher ( http://sensormasher.deri.org/ ), as well as open source tools developed by EU researchers, e.g. the D2RQ server ( Bizer &amp; Cyganiak, 2006 ), and the Triplify toolkit ( Auer, Dietzold, Lehmann, Hellmann, &amp; Aumueller, 2009 ). Taking the advantage of the Open Linked Data initiative ( http:// linkeddata.org/ ), large ontologies have been defined, for example, for the Health Care and Life Sciences domains we can men-tion MesH ( http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/ ), Disease ( http://diseaseontology.sourceforge.net/ ), EHR RM ( http://trajano.us. es/~isabel/EHR/ ), and GO ( http://www.geneontology.org/ ). As a result of the Open Government Initiative ( Alani et al., 2008; Auer, Lehmann, &amp; Hellmann, 2009 ), the government domain has emerged as one of the promising application area for Semantic Web technologies (e.g. see http://data.gov.uk/ ). 4.4. Semantic search and content discovery
Considering the applicability of SW technologies for search and content discovery, we can distinguish three different use scenarios of utilization of SW technologies: meaningful search in domain-specific applications, e.g. discovery and retrieval of geo-spatial information or indexing, cat-aloging, or searching for biomedical and health-related information and documents ( Doms &amp; Schroeder, 2005 ), visual search, navigation and querying of large public interlinked datasets within the Web of Data (e.g. see tools such as the SW indexing engine Sindice at http://www.sindice.com/ , the Semantic Information MAshup SIG.MA at http://sig.ma/ or the VisiNav system at http://visinav.deri.org/ ), hybrid search as a search method that supports both document and knowledge retrieval via the flexible combination of ontology-based search and keyword-based matching ( Bhagdev, Chapman, Ciravegna, Lanfranchi, &amp; Petrelli, 2008 ). As was previously stated, SW approaches proved their advantages in domain-specific applications on the search side. Considering the knowledge extraction side, the focus of research has moved from semi-automatic annotation ( Haslhofe,
Momen, Gay, &amp; Simon, 2010 ) and text-based topic discovery to semantic knowledge extraction from multimodal data sources ( Ahmed &amp; et al., 2010 ).

Comparing the SW search and metadata service engines such as Sindice, SWSE ( http://swse.deri.org/ ), Swoogle ( http:// swoogle.umbc.edu/ ), and Watson ( http://kmi-web05.open.ac.uk/WatsonWUI/ ) with the traditional ones such as Google and Yahoo, we conclude that the traditional search engines mainly search for unlimited topics in unstructured contents, while semantic search engines search for limited/unlimited topics in structured/unstructured contents. 4.5. Semantic annotation
Semantic annotations are machine-processable tags that are associated with a word, phrase, text, picture or video with the aim to describe that portion of data uniquely. SW annotation systems utilize text/video processing approaches to assign semantics, expose the annotations as linked data and to create links to contextually relevant resources on the Web (e.g.
DBpedia). The semantics of words differ from domain to domain, and therefore efficient semantic annotation requires do-main learning or manual domain specification in a form of taxonomy. Taking into consideration the type of annotation meth-od used, Reeve and Han (2005) distinguish two primary categories of semantic annotation platforms (Pattern-based and
Machine Learning-based). Building minimally-supervised and domain-independent methods for the population/construc-tion of ontologies (named also ontology learning) is still an open issue ( Manzano-Macho, G X mez-P X rez, &amp; Borrajoy, 2008 ).
Worth mentioning in this context is the European Commission X  X  support for several cross-national projects aimed at cre-ating resources for the community, e.g. the CALBC project ( X  X  X ollaborative Annotation of a Large-Scale Biomedical Corpus X  X , http://www.calbc.eu/ ) or Europeana ( http://www.europeana.eu ), a platform that links to millions of digital items (texts, images, videos, sounds) in cultural organizations all over Europe. 4.6. Natural language interfaces
Natural language search interfaces (NLIs) hide the formality of an ontology-based knowledge base as well as the execut-able query language from end-users by offering an intuitive and familiar way of query formulation. In a study with 48 real-world users and four interfaces featuring four different query languages, Kaufmann revealed that  X  X  X LIs to ontology-based ing the human involvement in the process of semantic content creation Siorpaes and Simperl (2010) came to conclusion that  X  X  X nteracting with semantic technologies today requires specific skills and expertise on subjects which are not part of the mainstream IT knowledge portfolio X  X . These findings lead to the conclusion that semantic technologies community has to pay more attention to the design of semantic applications. 4.7. Social networks
Social network technologies such as wiki-based systems and social tagging systems aim at interactive information shar-ing, facilitating interoperability, user-centered design, and improving the collaboration on the World Wide Web. The basic features of social networking sites are profiles, friends X  listings and commenting, messaging, discussion forums, blogging, media uploading and sharing. From the Semantic Web perspective, one of the limitations of the social network technologies is that metadata that is added to the Web content is based on freely chosen keywords (folksonomies) instead of a controlled vocabulary thus producing ambiguity in the meaning of words or phrases on the Web. Therefore, research efforts during the last several years have been devoted to bridging the gap between the Web 2.0 and Semantic Web paradigms and to developing and implementing SW tools and technologies into Social Web applications. Semantic MediaWiki ( http:// semantic-mediawiki.org ), for example, extends the MediaWiki Collaborative Knowledge Management System. Twarql in real-time and enabling expressive queries and flexible analysis of microblog data for sensemaking tasks ( Mendes, Passant, &amp; Kapanipathi, 2010 ). 5. Future development of Semantic Web technologies
Although many Semantic Web related technologies have emerged or have been elaborated in the last few years and have already been adopted in corporate environments, a lot still has to be done until the Berners-Lee X  X  vision of the Semantic Web becomes a reality ( Bizer et al., 2009; Shadbolt, Berners-Lee, &amp; Hall, 2006 ).

Investigating the adoption of the SW technologies by enterprises, we ( Janev, 2008 ) identified the following major open issues: scalability and run-time support, interoperability between different knowledge organization schemas, data synchro-nization between OWL/RDF based knowledge bases and the traditional persistence mechanisms, migration from traditional to semantic-enabled technologies. Herein, we will discuss the future development of SW technologies from the following ity, and (v) large-scale adoption. 5.1. Availability of content
W3C recommended several technologies including GRRDL, RDFa, and microformats aimed at extending the Web with structured data. The process of online conversion of the existing unstructured contents on the web into a format understand-able by computers is not a trivial, and not generally solvable task. However, we have to note here that majority of content on the web is generated dynamically, e.g. exported from RDBMS.

When the content stored in RDBMS is exported into RDFS, the problem of consistency and synchronization appears, be-cause the RDF store should be updated each time the RDBMS is updated. Therefore, it is a recent trend to use the RDBMS as a
SW endpoint and SPARQL + SPARQL/Update for ontology-based read and write access to relational data. 5.2. Interoperability issue
One of the most challenging and important tasks of the SW ontology engineering is the integration of ontologies with the purpose of building a common ontology for all Web sources and consumers in a domain. The available ontologies often ex-hibit different conceptualizations of similar or overlapping domains, thus leading to the interoperability problem. The prob-lem could be overcome by detecting semantic relations between concepts, properties or instances of two ontologies, i.e. ontology matching. Due to the increasing number of methods available for schema matching/ontology integration, the
Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (see http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/ ) was started with the aim to compare sys-tems and algorithms on the same basis and to allow anyone to draw conclusions about the best matching strategies. The recent and future trends in overcoming schema heterogeneity between linked semantic repositories, i.e. ontology matching consider using reasoning languages (e.g. Distributed Description Logics) to reason about ontology alignments in distributed environments. 5.3. Standardization and stability of languages
While the W3C makes extensive efforts to define and standardize the upper layers of the W3C SW architecture model that refers to logic, inference, and reasoning, the research communities come out with new SW languages (as was presented above). Reasoning is a distinctive feature of the Semantic Web. Currently, the advanced reasoning tools and technologies are mainly delivered by open source communities, while the contemporary commercial SW development frameworks offer integration with few years old reasoning engines such as Pellet, KAON2, or Jess. 5.4. Scalability of SW applications
Scalability is one of the key SW issues that relates to large ontology creation and maintenance, semantic metadata extrac-tion of massive and heterogeneous content and inference mechanisms ( Sheth &amp; Ramakrishnan, 2003 ). The scalability issue was identified very early in the SW research and adequately addressed. However, despite the huge number of SW applica-tions today, advanced SW technologies such as reasoning under open-world assumptions are hardly applicable in real-time on web scale. The recent efforts toward development of parallel inference engines for scalable distributed reasoning (see
WebPIE at http://www.few.vu.nl/  X  jui200/webpie.html ) give promising results. 5.5. Large-scale adoption 2010 ) X  X  and that  X  X  X he central deficiency of the Semantic Web is their static model of knowledge (ontologies), which implies static and predefined meaning of web-content ( Pohjola, 2010 ) X  X . Thus, we come to the problem of widespread adoption of SW technologies in situations where existing Web technologies already proved useful. In our opinion, additional investments are needed to mature SW technologies, especially, to optimize the querying and reasoning strategies. Concepts and methods al-ready proven in information retrieval (e.g. the MapReduce framework introduced by Google ( Dean &amp; Ghemawat, 2010 )) and data base processing (e.g. query adaptive result caching, view maintenance and query subsumption ( Auer, 2008 )) should be adopted to improve the performance of distributed systems and achieve scalable distributed reasoning. Instead of compet-ing, the Semantic Web should integrate features from other similar research communities, i.e. the Social Web and the Prag-matic Web ( http://www.pragmaticweb.info/ ). While the Semantic Web promotes  X  X  X ooperation through shared models of knowledge X  X , the Pragmatic Web  X  X  X oes not rely merely on shared models of knowledge, but also on shared ways of socially opment include ontology negotiations, the integration of contextual ontologies, and developing pragmatic patterns for defin-ing issues such as communication, information and tasks.
 6. Conclusion
The study presented in this article aims to answer the question  X  X  X s the Semantic Web merely a fashionable research topic or rather our reality and future? X  X  It analyses the current status and trends in the Semantic Web and discusses the adoption of Semantic Web technologies in practice.

The results obtained in this article show that semantic-based technologies have been steadily increasing their relevance in recent years in both the research and business worlds. W3C, together with universities and IT research organizations, and in cooperation with the major software companies and governmental agencies have already accepted many specifications, guidelines, protocols, software, and tools which are the basis for the realization of the Semantic Web vision. Innovative enterprises, interested in catching new opportunities from the Semantic Web, and also developing new business models, are involved in research projects and are introducing semantic technologies that facilitate data integration and interopera-bility, as well as improve search and content discovery. Considering the benefits from introducing SW applications, the ana-lysed early adopters from the W3C collection of Case Studies and Use Cases prove that SW technologies are useful for sharing and reusing data, improving search and establishing explicit content relations. To summarize, based upon the overall anal-ysis we have performed, we can conclude that SW technologies are finding their ways into applications, and that rather than being another research project, the Semantic Web becomes a reality.
