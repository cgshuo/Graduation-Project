 Mirko Tavosanis In 2003, the special issue of  X  X  X omputational linguistics X  X  (September, 29, 3) dedicated to the Web as corpus and edited by Adam Kilgarriff and Gregory Grefenstette was a landmark event for a promising field of study. Today, this book makes for a fine update, even if it is more limited in scope than its predecessor and less recent in its content than its date of publication would lead to believe. The articles included are in fact partially  X  X  X ased on papers presented at the symposium Corpus linguistics  X  Perspectives for the Future held ( ... ) in Heidelberg in October 2004 X  X  (p. 4). However, the editors state that some of the articles were commissioned later, and many of the texts have in fact been brought up to date to take recent developments into account.

As for the book itself, it is effectively divided into two parts of nearly equal length. The first includes articles with a  X  X  X ethodological X  X  bent, while the second is made up of seven papers dealing with different corpus linguistics approaches to English. In this regard, it is worthwhile pointing out that, in spite of the wealth of corpus linguistics work on other languages and the fact that the book X  X  contributions come mostly from scholars based in continental Europe, no languages other than English are dealt with at any length in a book named simply  X  X  X orpus Linguistics X  X . This second half of the collection is therefore mainly of interest to students of English, though, in a sense, it nicely complements some of the state-of-the-art summaries in the first section, discussing some practical applications of the tools described there.

One good example of this regards using Google as a research tool. After several years of trials and testing, it is now clear that Google search results can vary by up to an order of magnitude, even for frequent words or features (see for example the contribution by William H. Fletcher in this volume, pp. 25 X 45, Concordancing the web: promise and problems, tools and techniques , and in particular p. 37, drawing on research by Ve  X  ronis). Data gathered from this source cannot therefore be trusted for any kind of quantitative analysis. However, the sheer size of the Google database makes it possible to use this search engine to study words, features or constructions qualitatively, outside of the scope of traditional corpora. Accordingly, four of the seven articles in the second section make use of Google data  X  X  X n conjunction with tried and tested closed corpora X  X  (Christian Mair, Change and variation in present -day English: integrating the analysis of closed corpora and web -based monitoring , pp. 233 X 247, perhaps the most enthusiastic proponent of this approach; quote from p. 236). Uses of this sort can moreover be surprisingly varied. Other articles in this second section describe applications of Google to contrast collocation frequencies against data provided by WebCorp (Annette Rosenbach, Exploring constructions on the web: a case study , pp. 167 X 190),  X  X  X o provide a quick check on theories, assumptions and hunches X  X , which can then be studied later with more traditional corpora (Gu  X  nter Rohdenburg, Determinants of grammatical variation in English and the formation/confirmation of linguistic hypotheses by means of internet data , pp. 191 X 209; quote from p. 191), or simply to expand searches beyond the range of closed corpora (Lieselotte Anderwald,  X  X e rung the bell X  and  X  X he drunk ale X  X  non -standard past tense forms in traditional British dialects and on the internet , pp. 271 X 285).

This is not the only case where what is presented in the first half of the book forms the basis for the practical work described in the latter half. In fact, many concepts are repeated four or five times in the methodology sections of various articles. While this makes continuous reading a bit tiresome, it also represents a clear sign of the degree of consensus that has gradually emerged regarding the proper use of some Internet tools for linguistic research.

As for the other contributions in the  X  X  X ethodological X  X  half, the articles collected in the section  X  X  X ccessing the Web as corpus X  X  describe the main tools for doing just this. Anke Lu  X  deling, Stefan Evert and Marco Baroni tackle the issue in general in Using web data for linguistic purposes , pp. 7 X 24, while Fletcher centres upon his KwiCFinder, and Antoinette Renouf, Andrew Kehoe and Jayeeta Banerjee describe similar work carried out with WebCorp ( WebCorp: an integrated system for web text search , pp. 47 X 67). The three papers have been updated and provide some useful insights from the point of view of the creators of many of the tools now in common use.

Less practical, though no less useful, is the section entitled  X  X  X ritical voices X  X  (which, in fact, might be considered the book X  X  most interesting). Here, Graeme Kennedy argues that the BNC is  X  X  X nder-exploited X  X  as a resource for language learning ( An under -exploited resource: using the BNC for exploring the nature of language learning , pp. 151 X 166), while Geoffrey Leech, in one of the most interesting reviews of this type of problem in print to date, addresses  X  X  X he Holy Grail of representativeness X  X  ( New resources, or just better old ones? The Holy Grail of representativeness , pp. 133 X 149). In addition to introducing useful concepts such as the ACE (i.e.,  X  X  X tomic Communicative Event X  X ), Leech provides an excellent discussion of issues such as genre evolution, genres X  relation to representativeness and balancing of corpora. The issue of describing genres, hinted at in the 2003 issue of  X  X  X omputational linguistics X  X , is in fact one of the most promising directions of study for corpus linguistics, and even more so for  X  X eb-based X  corpus linguistics. Even the editors of this volume acknowledge this, especially from the perspective of  X  X  X ew text types ... (which) are interesting objects of study in themselves X  X  (Marianne Hundt, Nadja Nesselhauf and Carolin Biewer, Corpus linguistics and the web , pp. 1 X 5; quote from p. 2), and in terms of  X  X  X he impact that  X  X eblish X  or  X  X etspeak X  are having on our language use X  X  (p. 3).

The section on  X  X  X ompiling corpora from the Internet X  X , however, includes only three articles. Of these, the contribution by Douglas Biber and Jerry Kurjian, Towards a taxonomy of web registers and text types: a multidimensional analysis , pp. 109 X 131, is methodologically interesting, but essentially limited to excluding an idea that is, in any case, not particularly plausible (that linguistic features are significantly linked to text topics), only hinting at more thought-provoking concepts. As for Web genres, Sebastian Hoffmann uses the Web to compile a huge corpus of transcripts ( From webpage to mega -corpus: the CNN transcripts , pp. 69 X 85), while Claudia Claridge, looking at new text types, describes a corpus of forum posts in rather general terms ( Construction a corpus from the web: message boards , pp. 87 X  108). The latter in particular is a worthwhile study, since Web forums (dialogical, fast and widespread) form perhaps the most overlooked significant Web genre from the linguistics point of view. However, the ad hoc XML encoding proposed in the article appears to be a serious limitation to the use of such posts collections for linguistic purposes: the use of TEI-compliant encoding or other standard solutions would be a better alternative.
 In formulating some final remarks about the collection, it is best to return to Leech X  X  article, while keeping in mind genre-related issues. As noted by Leech, today X  X  search engines simply do not provide exhaustive coverage of the whole Web (p. 144). However, it must be admitted that such search engines do provide good coverage of a large segment of the Web, and this is an unparalleled feat in the history of linguistic studies. What would it be like to have access to the transcripts of, say, sixty percent of everything being said in everyday conversations, worldwide, in a living language? As long as their representativeness is not significantly skewed (and this does not seem to be the case), modern search engines give access to a sizeable chunk of the language being used in a huge textual communications media.

Moreover, looking at the Web with genre differences in mind, linguists should take careful note that entire text genres have been indexed in an even more complete way. Thanks mainly to Google Blogsearch, blog indexing, for instance, now seems very close to the 100% mark. To have nearly complete and virtually real-time indexing of a contemporary, open, text genre is of course a previously unheard-of occasion, one which should make linguists feel the pulse of language in a new way. It should also leave them eagerly awaiting future collections of essays such as this from which to take inspiration and follow the lead of the new opportunities they present.
