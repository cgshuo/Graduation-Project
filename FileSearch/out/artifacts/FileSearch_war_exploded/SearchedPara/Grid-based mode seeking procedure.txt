Nonparametric methods for density estimation are based on t he concept that the probability density Mode seeking procedure is guided only by the estimated densi ty and have no embedded assumptions and other data mining problems where processing of large dat a sets is required. 2. Related work
Mean Shift algorithm, widely adopted in computer vision com munity [4,5], is based on kernel density problems when fast processing of large number of data sample s is required. rather than the number of actual data samples. Moreover, the y are easy to implement and generally produce satisfactory results. In the DENCLUE algorithm [16 ] approximation of the PDF is obtained by using average shifted histogram technique [17]. The GCA [18 ] algorithm uses multidimensional grid the feature space is also used in [19] to accelerate well know n DBSCAN [20] algorithm based on the is repeatedly applied to the discretized domain, revealing clusters at different scales. 3. Density based clustering
Let D = { x clustering is based on the density attractor notion [16]. 3.1. Density attractors f : R d  X  R if x  X  is a local maximum of f . More formally where d ( x, x  X  ) is the distance in R d .

The shape of the PDF estimate is strongly influenced by the ban dwidth h , which defines the scale regions.

By selecting a different bandwidth h = h ( x 25] is defined: to obtain h ( x Significant improvements can be obtained [26,27] by setting the bandwidth h ( x square root of the density f D ( x where h constant  X  as the geometric mean of all n  X  f D ( x
Several techniques proposed in the literature can be used to select fixed kernel bandwidth h tistically motivated techniques define optimal bandwidth a s the bandwidth that minimizes Asymptotic Mean Integrated Squared error (AMISE) [28,29], i.e. the ban dwidth that achieves the best compromise where  X  f task-dependent, top-down information provided by the user or by an upper-level processing module can be used to control the kernel bandwidth [2]. 4. Grid based mode seeking to compute variable bandwidth (6). The proposed technique c an be summarized in the following steps: 1. quantize the data domain 3. assign variable bandwidth to each cell of the discretized domain 4. acquire final density estimate using the sample point dens ity estimator 5. detect modes by step-wise hill-climbing procedure 6. assign input data to clusters defined by the detected modes 4.1.

The introduced technique requires two passes through the da ta to compute the initial and the final preserving the accuracy. Let be the contribution of the sample x Let c approximately that cell. By inserting (15) into (14) we obtain: in which kernel contribution is accounted for. 4.2. Clustering and noise level
Clustering is based on determining modes of the estimated di screte density and associated basins of (satisfying  X  f D &gt; 0) has two stopping criteria: 1. Local maxima detected 2. Cell with already assigned label encountered Clustering procedure stops when all populated cells are lab eled.

Two modes are fused if path between modes exists with density above 75% of the density of lower mode. 5.
