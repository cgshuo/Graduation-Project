 Clinical Pathways (CPs) are artifacts that clinicians are i n-creasingly introducing in their practices in order to deal w ith health problems in the most effective, efficient and agreed way. As a result of an observational study at a Neonatology Intensive Care Unit, we found that most CPs are still paper-based. Although perceived useful even on paper, the physi-cians advocated a system integrating CPs with the clinical record. Based on their requirements, we present a proposal on how to conceive a computational system that can pro-mote awareness in order to achieve better coordination and committed inclusion of pathways in daily clinical practice .

The intrinsic limits of  X  X odels of action X  in determining the course of situated action are well acknowledged in CSCW literature from the seminal contribution by Suchman [20]. On the other hand, the course of situated action is not in-vented from scratch in any given situation: it is rather base d on a kind of knowledge, let us say a  X  X rocedural knowledge X , which is made explicit (i.e.,  X  X odeled X ) at various degrees in order to become a common reference point and contribute to an effective course of action in distributed collaborativ e settings. These models can be intended as either maps sup-porting orientation and overview, or scripts supporting the compliance to pre-computed procedures with which work can be planned and accomplished [18]. This twofold role holds for both the modeler , i.e., whoever makes the pre-computation, and the doer , i.e., the actor who interprets the model, performs actions in a certain context accordingl y and is responsible for them. For this reason, this twofold role can raise a tough conflict of interest, especially but no t exclusively, when it is experienced by the very same per-son, depending on the role she is currently playing: either that of  X  X anager X  (i.e., as planner of her work as well as of others X  work) or that of  X  X ractitioner X  (i.e., as actor in th e field of work). Similar situations are even more accentuated in the clinical domain, where the possible divide between process maps and the  X  X erritories X  of the temporal, spatial and contextual aspects of situated action can lead to either  X  X napplicable models X  or  X  X njustifiable actions X . In medic ine the main object of consideration  X  the single patient and her illness  X  is something quite difficult to classify ( diagno-sis ) and quite unpredictable in its behavior ( prognosis ) when reacting to clinicians X  interventions ( therapy ). The manager-practitioner dilemma profoundly characterized the hospit al setting we studied. Our goal was to understand the way and extent procedural knowledge, clinical knowledge and clini cal context can be combined and integrated to support situated clinical practice better. Yet, this situation is pretty com mon  X  and our findings generalizable  X  since similar problems can arise where the very same artifacts are used for different and even conflicting purposes: namely, either to support indivi d-ual decision making and coordination of care activities, i. e., what are also called the primary purposes of clinical docu-menting; or to facilitate the improvement of the quality of clinical practices, i.e., the secondary purposes of documen-tation [5,12].

In this paper, we focus on a particular artifact, namely the process map that is called clinical pathway 1 (CP for short). In specialist literature, several definitions of CP have bee n given: in what follows we conceive of a CP as a  X  map  X  -i.e., a schematic representation of a plan of preferred activitie s to undertake for the management of a homogeneous popula-tion of patients associated to a specific diagnosis from star t to finish of their episodes of care [1, 17]. CPs are rather new tools that doctors and nurses are beginning to become familiar with and whose use is often promoted by hospital care programs, integrated care pathways and the like. managements for a number of reasons: i.e., better legal ac-countability, medical evidence retention, quality contro l, re-source planning and smoother coordination. In management policies, CPs are tools that even doctors seem to advocate and accept [15] in their daily work, mainly because they are built collaboratively to achieve better quality of care, co n-tinuous learning and improvement, and better coordination with heterogeneous actors involved on the same clinical cas e.
While in the case of clinical records both the primary and secondary use is well acknowledged, clinical pathways are mainly presented and characterized from the perspective of their secondary use. However, as soon as they enter in every-day practice, the primary use comes upfront too, along with the conflict described above. We experienced the conflict-ing nature of CPs when we got involved in understanding, along with physicians, which role CPs play in current clinic al practices, i.e., if and how CPs are used as tools that facil-itate physicians X  situated work. Since the spring of 2006, we have been collaborating with some clinical practitioner s, both doctors and nurses, from the Neonatology Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of one of the most important teaching hospital in Italy. In particular, we had the opportunity to study the definition and use of clinical pathways within the daily activities at NICU. We soon realized that this inves-tigation was strictly related to the initial goal of carryin g on a feasibility study for the introduction of an improved version of an electronic clinical record that would be speci fic in dealing with NICU cases, without disrupting the current work habits of clinicians. According to practitioners, the main requirement regarding this improvement was to aug-ment clinical records to convey to physicians the knowledge pertaining to the work context in a way that makes this knowledge useful and usable: CPs were obviously part of this picture. More than that, CPs became the main fo-cus of attention since their conflictual role generated seve ral lively discussions between the practitioners and our resea rch team about the need for and nature of a technology support-ing clinicians in using CPs profitably. We believe that it is worthwhile to report on this phase of our research effort, even if the actual design of a full prototype is not completel y achieved and consequently a full evaluation of the envisage d solution has not been completed. In fact, during this phase we had an unique experience (at least for us) of the role that we were called to play: sometimes to promote solutions to fulfill requirements, sometimes to strongly contrast some r e-quired functionality by bringing in the stratified experien ces of failures we know about as researchers. Whether this story reflects a canonical way to conduct field research it is not the main point: on the one hand, the outcomes were a shared and deeper understanding of the implications in the practic e of the twofold role of CPs; on the other hand, the outcomes were a set of partially evaluated design choices that will guide the subsequent phases of technology development.
The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we report on the observational study about the definition and use of CP from the doctors X  perspectives. This study gave us mo-tives to undertake a modeling endeavor towards the inte-gration of CP process schema into the CR data schema (see Section 3). This integration is the  X  X onditio sine qua non X  t o begin conceiving innovative functionalities to support pr ac-titioners with an augmented integrated CP-CR system (see Section 4). Section 5 then proposes some ways by which awareness information on data context and clinical activit ies can be conveyed. Section 6 concludes the paper outlining the main next work in our research line.
During our observational study at NICU, we noticed that practitioners often referred to CPs during the interviews a nd informal talks, and so we were led to draw out a number of considerations advocating for their use in everyday practi ce. The main outcomes of the study can be described by the vivid images that doctors used to tell us why the clinical pathways are increasingly used within their ward, even be-yond the demands for better accountability and rationaliza -tion on the part of the hospital management. In what fol-lows, we mention two sketches which emphasize the relevant aspects about the definition and use of clinical pathways in the ward at hand. The name for these sketches has been suggested by clinicians themselves, namely: Social Paving and Coastal Medicine with respect to the definition and the use of CPs in the daily clinical practice, respectively.
Social Paving : The name regards the fact that in the process of building a reference CP, physicians also consoli -date the usual best practices they undergo in their ward, in a social and participative manner.

We observed that the definition of a CP for its local use is a social process involving practitioners of a specific hos pi-tal unit, either at ward or departmental level, and that the CP creation comes from a local and contingent combination of both a bottom-up and top-down approach. When com-mitted to some CP definition, physicians meet several times to share and validate the local practices they use at work when dealing with a well understood problem and to choose which could be defined the best practice to deal with this problem under homogenous conditions (the so called  X  X nclu-sion criteria X ). In these more or less formal meetings, as th ey discuss their current practices, they also refer to the curr ent and most updated scientific evidences, to the new techniques that members of the staff might have become proficient with and to the current technical and organizational context in which they work. The scientific development is considered by taking into account the new evidence that is reported technical and organizational milieus are considered in ter ms of either new structures and roles to involve in clinical ac-tivities or in terms of opportunities of gaining access to ne w diagnostic services and new equipments.

Accordingly, a CP is the result of a collaborative nego-tiation process where an acceptable compromise is reached between alternative ways to cope locally with a particular health problem locally, considering also scientific eviden ce reported in official guidelines and technical and organiza-tional constraints. As an example of the social nature of the CP definition, the head physician proposed to focus on the CP they designed for the treatment of neonatal infections due to the beta hemolytic streptococcus group B, i.e., the so called GBS pathway. This CP was chosen since GBS is the leading cause of death in newborns and the NICU felt the need to address this problem in a more systematic and effective way. In regards to this CP, the NICU physicians systematically developed statements to assist practition er and patient decisions about healthcare for specific circum-stances X  [11]. had several talks about what was the best time interval to keep the newborn under observation to understand whether the first signs of GBS infection would be manifest or not. Although each doctor proposed a slightly different time in-terval, at the end they agreed on a 48 hour time span. This was a compromise between significant spans reported in the GBS prophylaxis guidelines and what was considered a per-tinent span by doctors in their local and actual experience. This anecdote also sheds some light on the fact that CPs can play the role of knowledge artifacts [2], i.e., of artifa cts that stratify collective experiences in agreed best practi ces to make them available to single actors in coping with their patients with similar concerns.
 CPs were also, and primarily, intended to support doctors at the point of care , while guidelines were rather deemed as long and narrative collections of statements and recommen-dations that would be difficult to consult where there is a need for a concise reference.

As an example of this, the head physician told us that physicians dealing with the risk of GBS infection usually have to find a tradeoff between proper caution and prudent initiative. On the one hand, they would tend to anticipate the prescription of antibiotic therapy at the first signs of sepsis in order to prevent the full onset of the infection. On the other hand, administrating antibiotics to an underweig ht infant can be more dangerous than having the infection ad-vance further days. In order to balance these contrasting perspectives, physicians apply their experience, ability to interpret the smallest signs, and sensitiveness to the spe-cific case. Nevertheless, GBS guidelines recommend a wide battery of tests in different circumstances before undergoi ng antibiotic treatment to facilitate the diagnosis of infect ion. In this specific situation, CPs are used by doctors to be re-minded about which tests from those recommended by the guidelines have been chosen as the most relevant and feasibl e in their organizational context and about how to interpret their results to avoid, whenever reasonable, a premature pr e-scription of antibiotic therapy. A number of CPs are used at NICU for daily reference. These CPs are all denoted with respect to the problem or diagnosis they address, e.g., the GBS CP. CPs at NICU are usually represented as two or three page documents with sections mainly describing the a) inclusion criteria  X  i.e. , under which conditions a patient is eligible for the applica -tion of a given CP  X  and b) the sequence of clinical activities physicians have to consider in order to deal with the specific problem; these activities concern the prescription of ther a-pies, diagnostic examinations and other care intervention s as well as the main decision points that are related to spe-cific situations (e.g., what to do next if the result of a test is either positive or negative). This procedural knowledge is succinctly described in a diagrammatic form as flowcharts, in which activities are represented as boxes, decision and branching points as diamonds and causal relations as ori-ented arcs between boxes and diamonds. us suggestively that  X  X uidelines are like gorgeous and huge transatlantic liners that can not enter the small harbors of our medical everyday practice, and CPs are like tugboats which bring these liners to a dock X 
The usefulness of relying on a graphical and succinct rep-resentation of the procedural knowledge referred by CPs during the daily practice was confirmed in several obser-vational sessions: e.g., we saw doctors keeping an informal print of the CP in their pockets which was being currently applied to a couple of their critical inpatients. We also ob-served a number of clinical records having a CP flowchart print as their first, though informal, front page within the main folder. Apart from the very way CPs are represented at NICU and on which medium, our attention was drawn on the fact that it was up to the physicians to find proper ways to be supported by existing CPs during a situated practice and not only about a practice out of context. In our obser-vations of daily practices of CP consultation, we compared actual practices and accounts from the specialist literatu re on paper affordances and functionalities (e.g., [12, 13]) an d acknowledged the importance that these informal and flex-ible artifacts were paper-based: in fact CP prints were of-ten used for informal and provisional annotating and their portability at the point of care was a clear advantage that was often mentioned during the interviews. However, in these talks practitioners also pointed out the shortcoming s that could be traced back to the fact that CPs where just paper-based: the main one was that CPs were sort of  X  X ead letter X , that is not really connected with the data reported into the clinical record as well as with the very contingent and contextual facts occurring in the clinical case at hand. This necessary and continuous connection between process schemas and actual data reported in the CR was observed as an additional burden for physicians in the accomplishment of their daily work.

The possibility to recognize correlations between data and process schema has been seen as the preliminary step to make CP integrated with the clinical record and this integra -tion as a way to make CP both context-aware and proactive in terms of functionalities which are supportive for practi -tioners. In our talks, practitioners showed that they would be glad to rely on a digitally-augmented CP-CR dyad that could combine documental content (i.e. data) and activitie s in order to: (a) Provide practitioners with the relevant clin-ical information stored throughout the CR with respect to the current activity in the CP; this support was advocated especially for the sake of an effective information retrieva l and exploitation that require an apt conciseness. (b) Give them awareness on which the current task under completion is and which events have brought to its corresponding data set; this support was advocated especially with respect to handovers when the evolution of the illness trajectory is as relevant as the punctual information [4]. (c) Give them access to the explicit and situated procedural context of data use and production; this support was advocated for the constant need of practitioners to make sense of CPs on the basis of what is reported in the CR, as well as in differ-ent sources, like typically the Hospital Information Syste m (HIS), which we will illustrate later on. (d) Help them in either avoiding or handling collaboration conflicts [16], e .g., by respectively making them aware of producer/consumer interdependencies on-the-go and by coordinating access to shared resources. These considerations were the main mo-tivating rationales that drove us towards the integration o f data and clinical activities, as they are considered in CPs. The approach underpinning this integration is outlined in the next section.
The starting point for integrating clinical data and clinic al process maps is to identify which are the main interdepen-dencies existing between record X  X  and pathway X  X  elements, so that the needed information to characterize these rela-tionships can be properly modeled.

The proposed model  X  The interviews with the head physician of the NICU pointed out that physicians conceive of relationships between documents and sections of the clin i-cal record and the activities reported into pathways in term s of either  X  X hat enters X  into an activity (i.e., it is an input for an activity reading a CR document) or  X  X hat exits X  from an activity (i.e., it is an output of an activity writing onto the CR). This led us to conceive input and output relation-ships occurring at different levels of document and process schemas since physicians could relate activities to even si ngle fields of a specific CR form as well as to an entire multipage document stored therein. In addition to input/output rela-tionships with documental entries, an activity can be char-acterized also by sets of conditions that either must hold true for it to begin or that are true every time it is accom-plished. These conditions hold up in the clinical context that is made explicit and represented in the clinical record itself, in terms of clinical data (e.g., vital parameters, p ar-ticular annotations) as well as in other aspects of ward work that, at the NICU, were traced by or derivable from the HIS data structures: e.g., specific intervals of time elapse d during the accomplishment of an activity, notifications of exam completion, monitoring data from either biomedical or hospital equipments. Conditions that trigger, or better yet, enable a pathway activity, are called preconditions of that activity. For instance, the existence (i.e., arrival f rom the testing facility) of a test report triggers a new clinica l assessment. Similarly, conditions which become true with respect to the  X  X tate of the world X  and occur because of an activity are called the post-condition (or effects) of the ac-tivity. For instance, the effect of an X-ray exam is the tangi-ble radiograph that doctors can handle after its completion ; whereas the X-ray report is the output of the activity in the proper sense of the word; also the drowsiness of a patient coming back to the ward sedated from an invasive exami-nation is an important post-condition to consider, since an activity having this kind of effect on the patient cannot be followed by any activity that would require an active role by the patient, like just serving the daily lunch. The approach of deliberately focusing on Inputs, Outputs, Pre-conditio ns and Effects (namely, the IOPE approach) to characterize the interdependencies between activities and either infor ma-tional or tangible resources is not new (cf. e.g., [7,19]). W e adopted it in a design-oriented framework, called WOAD, which we developed for the provision of awareness informa-tion in computer-augmented documental domains [6] and then adapted to the clinical domain mainly because NICU practitioners seemed to favor the IOPE approach to model-ing and rephrasing what was indicated in their CPs in terms of  X  X eading X ,  X  X riting X  and  X  X ontextual conditions X .
A four-step approach  X  After a thorough analysis of the main CPs used at NICU, we adopted a sort of four-step approach by which to integrate CR data and CP ac-tivities with the participatory assistance of the practiti oners involved: (i) for each single activity referenced by a CP, de-tecting all those document-based sub-activities that can b e traced back to the execution and proper documenting of that clinical activity (e.g., reading a report, writing into a fo rm, sharing data with colleagues and gaining access to particul ar artifacts); (ii) characterizing the document-based activities in terms of relationships with the documental context, i.e. , detecting input and output relationships at the proper level of data granularity, ranging from single fields to entire sec -tions and sheets of the CR; these heterogeneous documental items can be seen as nodes of a rooted tree, representing the CR and its compounding elements (i.e., sheets, sections , tables, single rows, single fields) as shown schematically i n Figure 1; (iii) distinguishing 4 between decisional points that can be considered akin to complex medical assessments  X  and hence requiring physicians X  direct involvement -and points where the pathway branches off to strictly alternativ e paths according to some guard condition . A guard condition is just a true/false conditional expression that is evaluat ed according to a few well specified clinical values; (iv) charac-terizing the main clinical activities, the assessment deci sion points and the activity ordering in terms of preconditions and post-conditions that hold on specific data values, events and other contextual elements that are deemed relevant to be represented in the computational system.

Although this stepwise approach could seem quite com-plex, it is just the literal and afterward translation of what we actually did quite unawares during our modeling sessions with some of the NICU representatives. The main effort re-quired to clinicians in this integration process is then rel ated to the identification and characterization in IOPE terms of the interdependencies between the clinical activities men -tioned in their CPs of interest and the documents from the CR that are used in these activities. Yet, clinicians percei ved the modeling effort as acceptable for a number of reasons: first of all, the approach is based on the externalization of procedural aspects they are already familiar with and of doc -umental practices they accomplish everyday. Moreover, the effort is relatively limited in size: in fact, within a single ward, not every recurrent or common health problem is as-sociated to a pathway; and the number of use-intensive CPs by a certain staff is usually between ten and twenty, ap-proximately the same magnitude as the number of activities encompassed in a typical CP.

In our participatory sessions, we noticed that several pro-cess maps resulted quite inhomogeneous in regards to the necessary and sufficient granularity of the information char -acterizing clinical activities. Some CPs were quite detail ed in some sections, in terms of both preconditions and I/O correlations, and quite coarse in others. Yet, this was not perceived as a problem, but rather it suggested to us that clinicians felt the need to describe and characterize only those indications they entrusted and relied more on at a finer-granularity. This latter point led to the concept of criticality , which means giving CP indications a weight that represents their locally-perceived importance and reliab ility as will be treated in more detail in Section 5.

An example of use  X  To give an example of CP-CR inte-gration, let us focus on the medical assessment based on the  X  X lood culture test X  included in the GBS pathway (see BCA diamond in Figure 1). In this complex decision activity, within a CP are graphically represented as diamonds and are then different from activities that are rendered as boxes . Figure 1: An excerpt from the GBS clinical pathway and its IOPE correlations with a subset of the CR data structure. doctors are supposed to assess the result of a test (see BCT activity in Figure 1) aimed at helping them evaluating the presence of GBS in newborn X  X  blood: if evidences of GBS bacteria are detected, a full-cycle therapy of antibiotics is prescribed (see FCT box in Figure 1); otherwise, doctors ac-in Figure 1). When asked, physicians were able to strongly circumscribe the set of documents that are either read or written during this assessment activity: as its input, prac ti-tioners need to have access to those sections of the clinical diary ( I 1 in Figure 1) that address the problem in order to decide whether it is the case to prescribe a complete cycle of antibiotics or not. In addition, physicians also need to consult the test report (TR) where the results of the blood culture test are officially reported by the examining facilit y ( I ). This report is always attached to the clinical record as soon as it is available from the laboratory. On the other hand, as its outputs, the assessment produces a new en-try in the clinical diary ( O 1 ), by which physicians exchange their remarks with the colleagues of the next workshifts. Fo r what concerns preconditions, different events are consider ed for the activity to start: e.g., that the needed blood sam-ples have been taken, that the usually needed time for the culture to become significant has elapsed (i.e., two days), that the official medical report has become available (see P 1 arc in Figure 1, holding on the existence of the report); and that the child has been administered a first antibiotic therapy (see P 2 arc in Figure 1, holding on a value of the Prescription Sheet). These are all events that are reported in some point of either the official CR or the HIS at their occurrence. For instance, blood taking is reported in the HIS as soon as nurses print and attach specific labels to blood tubes via the HIS-mediated booking service. As ef-fects, the activity enables the PCR prescription (PCR) if th e blood culture test is assessed to be negative. Conversely, i f the test is considered positive, the assessment enables the activity in which a complete antibiotic therapy cycle is pre -scribed and administered (FCT). This activity writes on the prescription sheet ( O 2 into PS in Figure 1): more precisely, the PS fields where antibiotic administrations are requeste d, prescription date and time are registered, and the abbrevi-ations of the prescribing physician are annotated. As said before, the number and type of inputs/outputs referenced evaluate possible GBS infection. by an activity in the integration model depends on the level of granularity that is most suitable with respect to the re-quested functionalities.

Putting things at work  X  We undertook the system-atic modeling of a few CPs that physicians deemed as suf-ficient for an initial test-bed for the integration of CPs and CRs. For our prototypical application, we adopted a semi-automatic evaluation of preconditions to keep the current activity aligned with the data stored in the CR. From the modeling point of view, we used the notion of pre-and post-condition to represent the procedural knowledge reported i n the NICU CPs in terms of flow relation occurring between CP activities, i.e., what in the NICU flowcharts was indi-cated with small oriented arcs to express either temporal or causal precedences. In the GBS pathway for instance (see Figure 1), an assessment of the blood culture test (BCA) fol-lows the prescription and execution of the test (BCT) and leads to either a full cycle therapy (FCT) or a PCR test. The flow relation expressing execution order is modeled in terms of preconditions and effects and the correct order of activ-ity execution is ensured by the fact that one precondition of the following activity (in our example, the blood culture assessment) considers the internal state of the previous ac -tivity (the blood culture test execution), and hence it is tr ue if and only if the latter activity has been fully completed. An activity is considered enabled only once all its precondi -tions are made true by the current context. Instead, guard conditions for simpler branching points are instead repre-sented in terms of pairs of opposite preconditions inherite d by the activities following the point: for instance, if A and B are two alternative activities following a branching poin t on body temperature (say, either regular or high), A will have a precondition on regular temperature and B a precon-dition on high temperature. From the computational point of view, conditions are set to true automatically, accordin g to the data clinicians add to the clinical record, whenever this updating is reasonable and feasible, e.g., for conditi ons tied simply to data existence and values. Obviously, this is not always the case: e.g., the updating regarding whether an activity is currently in execution , or accomplished was pre-ferred to be left to the voluntary initiative of clinicians. In fact, automatically detecting whether certain activities are fully  X  X ccomplished X  or still  X  X n execution X  is not always a information. On the other hand, some clinicians were will-ing to notify the system activity states for two reasons: the y appreciated the functionality of being reminded on current CP activities, especially in the case when they are often interrupted. Moreover, they deemed the additional effort implied in manual notification to be definitely manageable for the magnitude of the task, as said above.
Once the modeling activity was feasible, we concentrated on the design of functionalities specifically oriented to ma k-ing clinical pathways more integrated with the twofold pro-cess of supplying and documenting care. It was at that based tasks and usually involve events, actions and other situational aspects that usually are not formally represen ted or even specified at all. stage that we had to confront our ideas on process map inclusion into situated practice with those of the intended users, especially the head physician. His high motivation o n computer-based support to clinical practice was an invalu-able element in guaranteeing us all the support and collabo-ration we needed to analyze the CPs used at NICU and col-lecting clinicians X  actual needs on CP inclusion in their wo rk practices. Nevertheless, his enthusiasm about the premise s of ICT of making CPs a more proactive and  X  X onstraining X  tool for the sake of accountability, quality of care and clin ical research led him to expectations for the prospective proto-type that contrasted our research experience and gave rise to very lively discussions. We both agreed that CPs should never be intended as prescriptive tools, neither the head physician conceived of them as underlying algorithms for proper data reporting and proactive activity proposition. Yet, he stressed the CP value of artifact embedding  X  X ir-tuous X  knowledge on  X  X hat should be done, when and by whom X  (to use an expressions of his) and argued that its integration in the clinical record would be an irresistible oc-casion to make clinical practice more uniform, and hence outcomes more easily comparable in order to enable clinical meta-analysis, practice benchmarking and clinical resear ch.
However, when we had to translate these generic concerns into specific functionalities, we had to share some key re-search questions like: To what extent does a CP have to be integrated in the regular flowing of documental activities? To what extent should a given and consolidated CP affect this flow, promoting efficient patterns of behavior associate d to a particular category of health problems and conversely discouraging ad-hoc, idiosyncratic and unexpected ways of coping with this problem when it occurs within a situated and unique clinical case? These questions were all about the role of recommendations in clinical work, the prescrip-tive nature that these indications can assume when they are based on the information gathered at the modeling phase and the role of tools that can enact these indications in pro-viding support to everyday coordination and practice.
In light of the discussions with the head physician, we un-dertook specific observational and interview sessions focu sed on the use of clinical guidelines and pathways at NICU. In these sessions, we observed that several prescriptive conv en-tions did not derive from fully reconciled and agreed prac-tices among clinicians, but were rather imposed by precise and strict laws prescribing how records ought to be compiled and which interventions should be offered to patients when certain conditions hold true. We were told that trespassers of some of these laws would be prosecuted with the expulsion from the medical register and with other serious penalties that are also inflicted on whoever fails to report any viola-tion of the law. To this regard, clinicians advocating the deployment of  X  X onstraining X  and prescriptive technologi es proposed to see them as preventive measures against legal problems and law infringements rather than a tight rein on their colleagues X  autonomy. Our role in the ongoing discus-sions was not to help assessing whether constraining func-tionalities could be either feasibly or usefully applied, b ut rather to disseminate in a highly receptive yet exigent mili eu awareness on the actual drawbacks of workflow-like support in the hospital domain by making reference to a number of contributions from the CSCW field (e.g., [14,21]).
As a result of our observations and discussions, we pro-posed to the head physician to conceive an electronic inte-grated CR as a tool that could flexibly convey and  X  X nact X  the intended prescriptiveness of process maps by switch-ing between three different interaction modes, where the more constraining mode includes the functionalities and af -fordances of the less constraining one. These modes are  X  1 ) full action allowed with graphical hints ;  X  2 ) full action allowed yet with need for justification ;  X  3 ) partly bound ac-tion with reasons given . The switching between these three modes would be done with respect to a number of aspects: e.g., according to regional or hospital policies, which are unlikely to change very often; or ward-and even single practitioner-specific presets (e.g., according to whether a clinician is a novice or an expert, an ICT enthusiast or a skeptic); or, to the other extreme of variability, accordin g to the current context and the very nature of the CP at hand. At the mildest level of prescription conveyance  X  the  X  X odality X   X  1  X  the system just hints what are the prefer-able or, conversely, heedless activities to do at any given time by changing the affordances and aspects of its graph-ical interface. The system leaves clinicians the freedom to undertake any action they deem necessary for the current moment. The same freedom of action is guaranteed at the second level  X  the  X  2 modality  X  but in this case the sys-tem also requires the clinician to provide a written account of her decision in the CR to satisfy accountability concerns . At the strictest level of prescriptiveness  X  the  X  3 modality  X  the system prevents practitioners from undertaking illega l activities  X  at least at the documental and information sys-tem level  X  but also gives them an explicit reason when it denies full access to a page or function for the sake of better accountability and transparency [10].

During a preliminary evaluation by a small and informal commission of clinicians, we were told that a system oper-ating in the modality  X  1 could play a role in the learning and community inclusion process of novices, while it would be important that proficient and expert users could turn off modality could be appreciated by expert practitioners with two stipulations: on the one hand, that they could postpone the provision of justification for the overriding of compute r-based suggestions so as not to disrupt their work; and on the other hand, justifications could be expressed succinctl y and in a free format. Indeed, their point was that most of the time to justify unusual decisions means to justify only professional intuition; and we all knew how difficultly intu-ition can be traced back to predefined categorizations [9]. I n short, working in the  X  2 modality was interpreted in light of accountability concerns  X  where the content of the justifi -cation provided matter for the sake of legal reconstruction ; or from the point of view of proactive cognitive aid, where being prompted for justification contributes to making the current situation  X  X resent-at-hand X  and to increasing pra c-titioners X  consciousness of the effects of their actions. Th e  X  est to the risks of a straitjacketing use of workflow systems: accordingly, we agreed that it should be activated only in cases where infringements would result in serious coordina -tive breakdowns (e.g., when no data reported would imply impossibility to act any further) or illegal, senseless dee ds from the medical point of view (e.g., prescribing drugs in lethal doses).
This complex negotiation of the kind of support to be provided by the integration oriented prototype led to a com-mon view that practitioners with heterogeneous skills coul d use pathways as maps  X  X lanking beside X  the clinical practice and that could be supported by means of the affordances conveyed through the records where actual practice is doc-umented. Consequently, we agreed that the approach em-ploying awareness provision  X  and hence, the  X  1 and  X  2 in-teraction modes  X  would be the aptest for their coordinative needs, since it is the most feasible to smoothly convey the  X  X cripting X  nature of standard procedures and critical pat h-ways in terms of educational recommendations to be eval-uated within a broader framework in which ethical, legal, professional and human concerns sustain the autonomous judgement and conscience of care givers.

At this point we had to further investigate the aptest modalities by which awareness information can be conveyed to make the possible differences between X  X he theory and the practice X  explicit as they occur in the medical domain. To this aim, we used the outcomes of a previous analysis [6] that led to the characterization of two main kinds of this in-formation: awareness of the work context in the past  X  i.e., the working context when data were recorded  X  or of the current work context  X  i.e., the context where practitioner s make decisions about either diagnostic or next therapeutic interventions.
In what follows, we illustrate these kinds of awareness in relation to the integration of CPs and CRs.

Accounting awareness on past work context is conveyed according to logging information.

The fact that clinical data and reference process schema are correlated allows the system to give awareness on i) who which time, iii) which task activity was documented (activi ty B in Figure 2), iv) and in response to which expectation and for which purpose (respectively, activity A and C in the CP example depicted in Figure 2).

Accounting awareness is aimed at making practitioners aware of past documental actions undertaken by colleagues: its provision can be either explicitly requested by the acto r currently consulting the documentation (e.g., by accessin g a sort of history or log of updates for a certain data field); or automatically provided by mechanisms that are triggered by contextual conditions, e.g., the fact practitioners are ed it-ing a field that is correlated with a datum inserted previ-ously. This kind of awareness relates to the requirement to facilitate the  X  X npacking of the context X  [3] of production of a certain documental value. The provision of this kind of awareness addresses the requirement (b) mentioned in Sec-tion 2.1.

Reminding awareness regards information that makes a user aware that she is supposed to do something, either about what she is currently working on or irrespective of it, to remind a particular actor or role that it is due time for the execution (or completion) of a previously scheduled task. For instance, blood samples at NICU are to be sent to the lab within twelve hours after prescription. Only actors that consult the lab exam sheet during this time span can Figure 2: An example of accounting awareness on a remark R on the clinical diary (CD). Actors can be made aware of the activity producing R (i.e., the data reporting B), as well as of other relationships with other data and activities, such as exam and drug prescription (activity A and C in Figure, re-spectively). be reminded of an outstanding prescription; in addition to that, the system can warn any actor of the due task after the time limit has passed, no matter her current documen-tal activity. The provision of this kind of awareness could address the requirement (a) mentioned in Section 2.1.
Coordinative awareness regards the information that the system can convey to make a user aware that her actions have an effect on others X  activities, i.e., that colleagues r ely on her documental activity. Accordingly, coordinative awa re-ness can be used to make actors aware of some activity in-terdependency so as to prompt them to actively avoid or handle coordination problems. For instance, actors can be made aware that their activity precedes activities that are  X  X aiting X  until theirs has been accomplished. In so doing ac -tors involved in the  X  X locking X  activities could feel commi t-ted and determined to support the dependent colleagues in order to avoid underutilization of resources or practition ers being kept idle and wasting their precious time. The provi-sion of this kind of awareness could address the requirement s (a) and (d) mentioned in Section 2.1.

Enabling and inhibiting awareness regard the information that makes actors aware of the preconditions (i.e., their ex -istence, their importance, their current status with respe ct to the current context) of the activities they are going to accomplish. Enabling awareness is used to suggest which activities could be done since their preconditions are all t rue in the current context, i.e., the current content of the clin ical record and some other contextual condition (such as abso-lute time or relative to some past event, relative position within the referenced CP, etc.). Awareness on what activ-ity is enabled can be provided to convey a slightly milder indication on a to-do activity than reminding awareness. In fact, enabling awareness can be conveyed to point out that some task could be executed, rather that it should be exe-cuted. Obviously, in order to prevent information overload , only those activities that are very specific to a given situa-tion are suggested to actors for commencement, i.e. activ-ities that are fine-grainedly characterized in terms of pre-conditions during the modeling phase. The provision of this kind of awareness addresses the requirements (b), (c) and (d) mentioned in Section 2.1. Conversely, inhibiting aware-ness regards information about the activities that should not be undertaken, according to the current context, in view of the fact that at least one of their preconditions are false. The fact that the same patient is needed during different activities (e.g., two examinations) or that an activity nec es-sarily needs another being completed (e.g., an examination needing the patient to be sedated) are all examples of what the coordination theory of Malone and Crowston [16] con-ceives of as conflicting activities, which can be avoided by timely conveying inhibiting awareness. As in the case of the enabling awareness, the designer has to avoid unsolicited warnings being raised, nagging actors about what they can not do at a given time. In order to prevent this happening, such awareness information has to be delivered to actors onl y when they are actually providing the computational system with evidence that they are executing an inhibited activity .
When faced with the question of how the technological support should convey the above mentioned kinds of aware-ness, we also had to consider the way and extent a com-putationally augmented documental system should support (or even propose) pertinent activities while discouraging (or even preventing) improper ones, in light of the peculiar re-quirements of the healthcare domain. Since this was the point on which physicians and our research team had the longest and most fruitful discussions, in what follows we concentrate on how the computational support can reconcile the X  X rescriptiveness X  of clinical recommendations expre ssed by modelers at compile-time with the degree of autonomy needed when practitioners (as doers ) confront them with a situated clinical case, i.e., at run-time.
 Figure 3: The pertinency/criticality conveyance in terms of intensity (line thickness) and colors (pat-tern orientation in greyscale rendering).
We performed a further analysis of the modeling outcomes and of the discussions that we had about to what extent pre-scriptiveness should be conveniently conveyed. This analy sis led us to identifying two complementary dimensions along which to compute enabling and inhibiting awareness. These two orthogonal dimensions are criticality and pertinency . As anticipated in Section 3, criticality indicates how import ant it is to strictly follow a CP for a doctor coping with the corresponding health problem. Pertinency relates to the ex -tent the accomplishment of an activity is coherent with the current work context.

Criticality is associated both to activities and their pre-conditions, as part of the physicians X  effort of modeling the interdependencies among CR documents and CP activities. NICU physicians have indicated activities as critical for a number of reasons: e.g. activities that they should accom-plish with as few interruptions as possible; which they woul d have to pay particular attention to; which require involved patients to undertake painful treatments; which refer to ei -ther recommendations with strong evidence or to strict pro-tocols of care. Critical preconditions are those precondit ions whose validity is strictly necessary for the activity to be a c-complished or even commenced. Criticality then positively relates to the importance associated to preconditions and t o the strictness of the whole set of preconditions of a certain activity once each of them are characterized by a weight in the CP-CR integration phase (see Section 3). In regards to those preconditions expressing flow (precedence) relati on, criticality means strictness of ordering. To give a didacti c but clear example, the precondition stating that  X  X lipping on shoes X  can start only after that of  X  X lipping on socks X  has been accomplished is deemed stronger, i.e., more critical , than a precondition requiring that  X  X lipping on socks X  pre-cedes  X  X lipping on a jacket X . Mutatis mutandis, CPs conveys preferences on the order by which clinical activities should be accomplished: in fact, by means of the criticality weight , doctors can express the extent they commit themselves in considering recommended orderings as strict indications i n actual practice. Summing things up, when criticality in-volves activities and decision points, it refers to their ro le as milestones in the caring process (e.g., what cannot be skipped); when criticality involves preconditions of an ac tiv-ity, it refers to their relevance in deciding whether to exec ute the activity or not.

Conversely, pertinency is conveyed by the system during the unfolding of the care process and regards the strength by which a specific CP activity is either suggested or ad-vised against. The pertinency value is computed taking into account the number and criticality of preconditions that ar e true with respect to all the preconditions of an activity: e. g., the pertinency of an activity whose preconditions are all tr ue is higher than the pertinency of an activity having at least one of its preconditions false. Likewise, the pertinency of an activity whose most critical precondition is true is high er than the pertinency of an activity whose minor precondi-tions are true and its most critical ones are false.
Criticality is conveyed through a corresponding modula-tion of intensity upon the graphical representation of the CP at hand (see vertical axis in Figure 3). Conversely, pertinency is conveyed by modulating the color of the ele-ments depicted in the CP in use (see horizontal axis in Fig-ure 3). Intensity and coloring are orthogonal yet combinable operators. They can be both applied to all elements of a CP, according to both the schema process and the current context, respectively: i.e., flow relations, activities, d ecision points, and the IOPE correlations drawn in the integration model. The coloring makes arcs and elements colored with the corresponding color (either red or green, when activiti es are inhibited or enabled, respectively). When intensity is applied to flow relations, the thickness of the correspondin g arcs is changed accordingly. The same holds when intensity is applied to activities/decisions, when their borders are en-larged and colors (if any) are made brighter. Since critical ity regards the schema process, intensity is applied to the CP structure both when the CP is not yet in use and when it is applied to some clinical case, i.e., at run-time. Since colo rs are used to convey pertinency, they are set by the system at run-time only and applied to a CP in use.

To have a first feedback from NICU X  X  practitioners on how the intended functionalities concerning awareness on crit ical-ity and pertinency could work in practice, we mocked up an interface for the GBS pathway. The solution was considered by doctors as a good starting point for the full implemen-tation of a feasible prototype. A fragment of the GBS CP considered in the mockup is shown in Figure 4 (an extension of Figure 1) and will be commented in what follows.
In regards to criticality, the head physicians draw our at-tention to two contiguous sections of the GBS CP (see a and b sides in Figure 4). In regards to the side a , the GBS CP suggests that doctors prescribe a blood culture test (BCT box in Figure 4) before administering any antibiotic (AT box) for the newborn suspected of being GBS infected. In fact, giving antibiotics to non-infected patients can be da n-gerous for the risk of creating drug-resistant bacteria and especially of endangering patients X  metabolism. For this r ea-son, doctors have to receive the informed consent from the newborn X  X  parents before prescribing the treatment. Ac-cordingly, in order to remind doctors that the activity is risky and that the consent is really needed, the AT box is rendered as in Figure 4 with a thicker border and it is connected to a critical precondition, respectively. Unfor tu-nately, bacteria cultures need time to become significant fo r diagnosis (since bacteria need to grow and become manifest) and time is a critical dimension when health conditions of a weak premature infant are worsening and a child X  X  life is threatened. As mentioned in the  X  X oastal medicine X  anec-dote in Section 2, some NICU doctors tend to anticipate therapy prescription on the basis of subjective indication s: consequently, they have therapy administered before a com-plete culture test is ready and, sometimes, even before it is actually prescribed, thus reversing the CP sequentiality. On the other hand, the GBS CP states that two days after the first bacterial sample and irrespective of the length of the therapy regime till then, a comprehensive assessment must be performed (BCA box in Figure 4). In these two cases, the system reminds doctors about the different criticality of flow relations using different graphical clues. On the one hand, in situations where criticality is higher, the system displays thicker lines connecting the corresponding eleme nts of the CP. For instance, since the sequential order between the suspension of the antibacterial therapy (after two days ) and the assessment of the culture (to decide whether to com-plete the therapy or make a PCR test) is strict, the system conveys this order by displaying a thick line connecting the two related CP activities (see the Antibiotic Therapy -AT box -and BCA diamond in Figure 4). On the other hand, in situations where the criticality level about sequential or-der is lower  X  e.g., in the case of therapy administrations and diagnostic tests that can swap their execution order  X  the system displays a thin line connecting the related CP elements.

The case depicted in side b of Figure 4 gives us the oppor-tunity to illustrate an interesting case where the conveyan ce of pertinency and criticality information are combined in or-der to have neonatologists recall to share their opinions an d consult each others even in seemingly routinary situations . In this case, doctors are supposed to prescribe a PCR test after the culture assessment, if this is negative. The avail -ability of PCR results establishes a branching point where two alternative paths can be chosen according to the very test results. As PCR test outcome, the examining facility provides a report in which numeric values are used. The CP encompasses clinical knowledge by which values greater tha n two are clearly associated with a positive outcome, while values less than one must be usually interpreted as a clear negative outcome of the test. The former option calls for a further battery of tests (activity E in Figure 4), which are more expensive and also potentially more dangerous for the infant but can also detect GBS more clearly. The latter op-tion means  X  X xit from the GBS CP X , since no clear diagnosis of GBS can be made yet and other hypotheses must be en-tertained (eventually with the support of other pathways). Since the probability of false negative results is much lowe r than the probability of false positive, doctors have modele d the lower branch in Figure 4 as more critical than the upper one, so to say that if the test is lower than one there is strong evidence that GBS hypothesis can be rejected. The difficult case occurs when the result value is between one and two, say 1.8 (see Figure 4). In this situation, it is not straightf or-ward for the doctor on-duty to assert a test either positive o r negative, although she can give the positive option a slight preference. In this specific case, the system identifies that at least a precondition of both the activities following the PCR decisional point are false. Accordingly, by displaying both the positive and negative branches in red, the system suggests that both positive and negative branches have the same pertinency and that neither of them should be un-dertaken,  X  X ebus sic stantibus X . This is an all but trivial example of how the system can emphasize the pertinency of the activities encompassed as routine within a CP and create them present-at-hand . Indeed, since both alternative branches from the same condition are associated with the same pertinency and rendered with the same color (red), the doctor is suddenly made aware that something out of the ordinary happened  X  i.e., that a routine test calls for further elements to consider. In addition, also criticalit y in-formation is combined to give the doctor more information with respect to the corresponding GBS guidelines. The CP exiting activity (the circle in Figure 4) is rendered as more critical; indeed, if the doctor chooses it, she is actually t aking a far reaching decision that is going to affect the next course of clinical action since it is assumed that GBS infection can be excluded with some certainty. The enquiring activity (E in Figure 4), instead, is rendered as less critical, since it just puts physicians in the position of searching other evidence in order either to confirm or exclude their hypothesis. Critica l-ity and pertinency indications are a way to suggest to the single doctor on-duty that the clinical case at hand needs further examination in relation to symptoms, diagnosis, an d treatment that could be brought to her colleagues X  attentio n in the next clinical meeting.
In this paper, we presented an approach to integrate pro-cess maps (as Clinical Pathways in medical practice are) with the work context that is represented in terms of data reported in an official record system (as the Clinical Record in hospital domains is). In particular, we focused on the way an augmented record system can convey awareness informa-tion on the indications provided by process maps and task-oriented recommendations in terms of their intended pre-scriptiveness, local criticality and situated pertinency with the task at hand.

This approach resulted from the interactions we had with practitioners of a NICU; in particular, these interactions shed light both on the practical implications of the conflict -ual uses of these artifacts and on the difficulty of finding an apt supportive technology for the situations at hand. This approach is coherent with the suggestion that systems that support  X  X inding and presenting the planned  X  X rder of work X  rather than enforcing it X  [8] can significantly limit the ris k of frustrating practitioners with the need to maintain both computer-based and traditional paper-based systems [14], getting bad results from both.

As anticipated, we are currently in the middle of our re-search path; the next steps are the full implementation of th e prototype and its evaluation with the NICU practitioners. Although the medical domain is very peculiar and critical, our preliminary analysis of the Archeology Research domain seems to share some basic features. For instance, the exis-tence of intended protocols in the light of high contingency and harshness of contextual conditions, as well as of irre-versibility of wrong behaviors during excavation. We then plan to compare the two domains more in depth with the aim of deriving synergies and evaluating the extent the ap-proach is applicable to the new domain.
