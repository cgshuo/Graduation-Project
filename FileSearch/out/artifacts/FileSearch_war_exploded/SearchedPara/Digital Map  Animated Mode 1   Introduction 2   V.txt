 geography information learning, the traditional forms of literal presentation and handing maps would not been consisted to the large demands. As we know, only paper information is not enough, while we would not get the vivid concepts if the information being so abstract. Nowadays, people advocated that the information should be digitalize, which is converted the information into the digital library. It is not only to keep immortally, but also contribute the comprehension of people X  X  learning. Besides utilizing some technology skills. The demo we want to display is about a concept of digital map. In this demo, we merged both geography and history, and we presented the important historical events of different regions on the digital map, that we can realize earth, etc. We reserved several literal data to complement the maps and the animations to let the users to receive the whole information easily and instantly. Then, we would describe it deeply at the following paragraphs. history. In the traditional way, we should find the maps in the map room, searching page by page, while we need it. But in our demo, we simplified it for we show it out on the screen of the computer. 
First of all, when we begin to use the demo, we can see the locations, sizes, and short introductions of the regions from the world map and easily get the whole concepts of it. ( see Fig. 1. ) 
Then, from entire to individual, choosing each button at the top, the lager maps will been seen that would enhance the realization with the figures of the regions or the round environment of areas, such as coasts, islands, or neighbor fields, etc. ( see Fig. 2.) 
A bit of concept comes from GPS (Global Positioning System). You can speedy browse the map from small to large; it could save a lot of time rather than searching map books. However, the most special part is that, in seeing the relationships with the regions, we show it by the animated maps. Take Fig. 3 as an example, the tiny boats can move automatically on the screen; by their footing, learners may learn some information, such like, the boats X  directions or the destinations of the geographic discovery, or the colonies at that age. 
Also, the mode is a sort of like situational simulation. We use the situational simulation to help the learners organize the information and quickly connect the map and the information. If we use the map books, we certainly could not do so, because the animations and maps can provide a more natural way to organize the materials. Research has shown that people can recognize very large numbers of pictures. From the theories of cognitive psychology, there must have been a short time to visualize the things, we saw or heard, between the cognitive processes of human beings. Research on the recognition of pictures by Standing, Conezio, and Haber(1970) showed that people recognized 2650 pictures with a hit rate of 0.95 or better. There is a management of visual center in human beings X  right hemisphere and would see the mental pictures. We use this ability everyday, while we remember the routine of the work or go to a familiar restaurant or image a red apple. Actually, we not only see by gathered in the visual center of the brain through many tracks of visualization techniques for scanning to the brain. 
And another theory is that,  X  X  picture is worth a thousand words, X  from Capacchione (2000). Pictures really can improve our profundity of the comprehension to the things. People can get the general ideas or concepts and it would be speedier than just seeing enhance the construction of knowledge efficiently. 
What is more, the animations on the maps might stimulate learners learning motivations and interesting. Users would easily been attracted by the vivid maps and the animations. 4.1 Cross Platform Use It would be a constriction if the system was limited in a specific platform. For that, in Internet is requisite. Hence, we used Macromedia Flash to do our demonstration for its characteristic that can perform by Internet Ex plorer in any platforms, such like Mac OS, Linux, or Windows, etc. Furthermore, it is also convenient for the designers to update World Wide Web. 4.2 Extend Learning Places Accounting for the generality of the World Wide Web, we can not only use the web pages for a stimulus or reinforce in learning in schools, but it also can be in good used after school. For instance, students can presen t their learning materials to their parents conditions and enhance the interactions and discussions with each other (Lambert, Carpenter, 2005). It is revealed that the learning places is been extended, and the more possibility of learning functions will be created through World Wide Web, just as the expectation of our goal of the demonstration. The digital map we designed is to perform a novel function in reading the maps that is tiny animated object moving on the map. And, as we know, there is so much information on World Wide Web. Sometimes, they lack of construction that the users are hard to organize all the means they want. Consequently, we give a focus on the integrated information instead of providing all. It is believed that there will be more and more different forms of digital maps. And the form of our digital map could be maps and let the users easily possess the information through World Wide Web .
