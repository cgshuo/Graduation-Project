 It is no surprise that through stages of language learning , different words are learned at different times and are known to different extents. For e x-ample, a common word like  X  X og X  is familiar to even a first -grader, whereas a more advanced word like  X  focal  X  does not usually enter learners X  vocabulary until much later. Although individual rates of learning words may vary between high -and low -performing students, it has been observed that  X  X hildren [...] acquire word meanings in roughly the same sequence X  (Bie miller, 2008). knowledge of words at different learning stages. Such a metric would have extremely useful appl i-cations in personalized educational technologies, for the purposes of accurate assessment and pe r-sonalized vocabulary instruction. Previously, related work in education and ps y-chometrics has been concerned with measuring word difficulty or classifying words into different difficulty categories. of word lists for targeted vocabulary instruction at variou s grade levels that were compiled by educ a-tional experts , such as Na tion ( 1993) or Biemiller (2008). Such word difficulty assignments are also implicitly present in some readability formulas that esti mate difficulty of texts , such as Lexiles (Stenner, 1996) , which include a lexical difficulty component based on the frequency of occurrence of w ords in a representative corpus, on the a s-sumption that word difficulty is inversely correla t-ed to corpus frequency. Additionally, r esearch in psycholin guistics ha s attempted to outline and measure psycholinguistic dimensions of words such as age -of -acquisition and familiarity , which aim to track when certain words b ecome known and how familiar t hey appear to an average pe r-son.
 can be thought of as functions that assign a single scalar value to each word w : metrics, regardless of whether they are derived from corpus frequency, expert judgments or other measures.
 one that is interdependent with the rest of the v o-cabulary. Wolter (2001) writes: word will become fully known, it makes more sense to model the degree to which a word is known at different levels of language exposure. tival: t he degre e of word understanding depends not only on the word itself, but also on the sophi s-tication of a given learner . Consider again the di f-ference between  X  X og X  and  X  focal  X : a typical first -grader will have much more difficulty understan d-ing the latter word com pared to the former, wher e-as a well -educated adult will be able to use these words with equal ease. Therefore, the degree, or maturity, of word knowledge is inherently a fun c-tion of two parameters --word w and learner level l : learners) , we would expect the degree of unde r-standing of word w to approach its full value co r-responding to perfect knowledge; this will happen at different rates for different words. testing word knowledge of learners across diffe r-ent levels (ages or school grades) for all the words in the lexicon. Such a procedure, however, is pr o-hibitively expensive; so instead we would like to estimate word maturity by usi ng computational models.
 opment of meaning of words as a function of i n-creasing exposure to language, and ultimately -the degree to which the meaning of word s at each stage of exposure resem ble their  X  X dult X  mea ning. We therefore define word meaning maturity to be the degree to which the understanding of the word (expected for the average learner of a particular level ) resembles that of an ideal mature learner. 3.1 Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) An appealing choice for quantitatively modeling word meaning s and their growth over time is L a-tent Semantic Analysis (LSA), an unsupervised method for representing word and document meaning in a multi -dimensional vector space. unsupervised manner, based on occurrence pa t-terns of words in a large corpus of natural la n-guage documents. A Singular Value Decomposition on the high -dimensional matrix of word/doc ument occurrence counts ( A ) in the co r-pus , followed by zeroing all but the largest r el e-ments 1 of the diagonal matrix S , yields a lower -rank word vector matrix ( U) . The dimensionality reduction has the effect of smoothing out inc i-dental co -occurrences and preserving significant semantic relationships between words. The resul t-ing word vectors 2 in U are positioned in such a way that semantically related words vectors point in similar directions or , equivalently, have higher cosine values between them. For mo re de tails, please refer to Landauer et al. ( 2007) and others. edness, LSA has been shown to emulate the lear n-ing of word meanings from natural language (as can be evidenced by a broad range of applications from synonym tests to automated essay grading), at rates that resemble those of human learners ( Laundauer et al, 1997 ). Landauer and Dumais (1997) hav e demonstrated empirically that LSA can emulate not only the rate of human language acquisition, but also more subtle phenomena, such as the effects of learning certain words on mea n-ing of other words. LSA can model meaning with high accuracy, as attested , for example, by 90% correlation with human judgments on assessing the quality of student essay content (Landauer, 2002). 3.2 Using LSA to Compute Word Maturity computationally estimating word maturity of a learner at a particular intermediate level ( i.e. age or school grade level) is as follows: ber of levels. These levels may directly correspond to school grades , learner ages or any other arb i-trary g radations. given word at a given learner level by comparing the word vector from an intermediate LSA mod el ( trained on a corpus of size and sophistication comparable to that which a typical real stu dent at the gi ven level encounters ) to the corresponding vector from a reference adult LSA model ( trained on a larger corpus corresponding to a mature la n-guage learner ) . A high discrepancy between the vectors would suggest that an intermediate mo d-el X  X  mean ing of a particular word is quite different from the reference meaning, and thus the word maturity at the corresponding level is relatively low. 3.3 Procrustes Alignment (PA) is less straightforward , since the indi vidual dime n-sions in LSA do not have a meaningful interpret a-tion, and are an artifact of the content and ordering of the training corpus used. Theref o re, direct co m-parisons across two different spaces, even of the same dimensionality, are meaningless, due to a mismatch in their coordinate systems.
 gebra technique known as Procrustes Alignment (or Pro crustes Analysis) (PA) typically used to a lign two multivariate configurations of a corr e-sponding set of points in two different geom etric spaces. PA has been used in conjunction with LSA, for example, in cross -language information retrieval (Littman, 1998).

In summary , given two matrices containing coordinates of n corresponding points X and Y (and assuming mean -cente ring and equal number of dimensions, as is the case in this work), we would like to mi n-imize the sum of squared distances between the points: which minimizes M 2 by rotating Y r elative to X . That matrix can be obtained by solving the equ a-tion: It turns out that the solution to Q is given by VU X  , where U  X  V X  is the singular value decomposition of the matrix X X  X  .
 adult and intermediate , the alignment points are the corresponding document vectors correspon d-ing to the documents that the training corpora o f the two models have in common (recall that the adult corpus is a superset of each of the intermed i-ate corpora). The result of the Procrus tes A lig n-ment of the two spaces is effectively a joint LSA space containing two distinct word vectors for each word (e.g.  X  dog1  X ,  X  dog2  X ), corre s ponding to the vectors from each of the original spaces. After merging using Pr ocrustes Alignment, the compar i-son of word meanings becomes a simple problem of comparing word vectors in the joint space using the standard cosine metric. In our experiments we used passages from the MetaMetrics Inc . 2002 corpus 3 , largely consisting of educational and literary content representative of the reading material used in American schools at different grade levels. The average length of each passage is approximately 135 words.
 pose d of 6 ,000 text passages, intended for school grade 1 or below. The grade level is approximated using the Coleman -Liau readability formula (Coleman, 1975) , which estimates the US grade level necessary to compreh end a given text, based on its average sentence and word length statistics: where L is the average number of letters per 100 words and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words. additional 6 ,000 new passages of the next grade level , in addition to the previous corpus. In this way, we create 14 levels. The adult corpus is twice as large , and of same grade level range (0 -14) as the largest intermediate corpus.
 and makeup of the corpora used: readability formula (CLI) is not essential ; our e x-periments show that other well -known readability formulas (such as Lexiles) w ork equally well. All that is needed is some approximate ordering of passages by difficulty, in order to mimic the way typical human learners encounter progressively more dif ficul t materials at successive school grades.
 the intermediate corpora with the adult space , using Procrustes Alignment. This results in a joint space with two sets of ve c-tors: the versio ns from the intermediate space { v l w } , and adult space { va w } . tween the two word vectors for the given word w In the cases where a word w has not been encou n-tered in a given intermediate space, or in the rare cases where the cosine value falls below 0, the word maturity value is set to 0 . Hence, the range for the word maturity function falls in the closed interval [0.0, 1.0] . A higher cosine value means greater similarity in meaning between the refe r-ence and intermediate spaces, which implies a more mature meaning of word w at the level l , i.e. higher word meaning maturity. The scores b e-tween discrete levels are interpolated, resulting in a c on tinuous word maturity curve for each word. turity curves for some of the words. Consistent with intuition, simple words like  X  X og X  ap proach their adult meaning rather quickly, while  X  focal  X  takes much longer to become known to any degree. a noticeable plateau in the middle. This can be explained by the fact that this word has two di s-tinct s enses. Closer analysis of the corpus and the semantic near -neighbor word vectors at each i n-termediate space, shows that earlier meaning deal almost exclusively with the first sense ( bird ), while later readings with the other (country ). Therefore, even thou gh the word  X  turkey  X  is quite prevalent in earlier readings, its full meaning is not learned until later levels . This demonstrates that our method takes into account the meaning , and not merely the frequency of occurrence . 5.1 Time -to -maturity Evaluation of the word maturity met ric against external data is not always straightfo r ward b e-cause, to the best of our knowledge, data that co n-tains word knowledge statistics at different learner level s does not exist. Instead, we often have to evaluate ag ainst external data consisting of scalar difficulty values (see Section 2 for discussion) for each word , such as age -of -acquisition norms d e-scribed in the following subsection. possible. One is to compute the wo rd maturity at a particular level, obtaining a single number for each word. Another is by computing time -to -maturity : the minimum level (the value on the x -axis of the word maturity graph ) at which the word m a tur i ty reac h es 4 a pa r ti cu lar threshold  X  : in a learner X  X  development when a given word b e-comes sufficiently understood. T he parameter  X  can be estimated empirically (in practice  X  =0.4 5 gives good correlations with external measures). Since the values of word mat urity are interpolated, the ttm(w) can take on fractional values.
 of word maturity into a scalar value inherently results in loss of information; we only perform it in order to allow evaluation against externa l data sources.
 word frequency, namely the document frequency of words in the adult corpus. 5.2 Age -of -Acquisition Norms Age -of -Acquisition (AoA) is a psycholinguistic property of words originally reported by Caro l &amp; White ( 1973) . Age of Acquisition approximates th e age at which a word is first learned and has been proposed as a significant contributor to la n-guage and memory processes . With some exce p-tions, AoA norms are collected by subjective measures, typically by asking each of a large number of participants to estimate in years the age when they have learned the word. AoA estimates have been shown to be reliable and provide a valid estimate for the objectiv e age at which a word is acquired; see (Davis, in press) for references and discussion.

Based on results of multiple -choice word comprehension tests administered to students of di fferent grades as well as expert judgments, the author derive s several word diff i-culty lists for vocabulary instruction in schools, including: o Words known by most children in grade 2 o Words known by 40 -80% of children in o Words known by 40 -80% of chi ldren in o Words known by fewer than 40% of chi l-One would expect the words in these four groups to increase in difficulty, in the order they are pr e-sented above. the word maturity metric, we assign each of the words in the four groups a difficulty rating 1 -4 respectively, and measure the correlation with time -to -maturity. The word maturity metric shows higher correl a-tion with instruction word list norms than word frequency. 5.4 Text Complexity Another way in which our metric can be evaluated is by examining the word maturity in texts that have been leveled, i.e . have been assigned ratings of dif ficulty. On average, we would expect more difficult texts to contain more difficult words. Thus, the correlation between text difficulty and our word maturity metric can serve as another va l-idation of the metric.
 readings that are used as reading comprehension tests by different state websites in the US 7 . The collection consists of 1,220 readings, each ann o-tated with a US school grade level (in the range between 3 -12) for which the reading is intended. The average length each passage was approx i-mately 489 words.
 of the grade level with time -to -maturity , and two other measures, namely: In this section, we would like to highlight certain properties of the LSA -based word maturity metric, particularly aiming to illustrate th e fact that the metr ic tracks acquisition of meaning from exp o-sure to language and not merely more shallow e f-fects, such as word frequen cy in the train ing corpus. 6.1 Maturity based on Frequency For a baseline that does not take meaning into a c-count, let us construct a set of maturity -like curves based on frequency statistics alone. More specif i-cally , we define the frequency -maturity for a pa r-ticular word a t a given level as the ratio of the number of occurrences at the intermediate corpus for that level ( l ) to the number of occu rrences in the reference corpus ( a ): Similar ly to the original LSA -based word maturity metric , this ratio increases from 0 to 1 for each word as the amount of cumulative language exp o-sure increases. The corpora used at each interm e-diate level are identical to the orig inal word maturity model, but instead of creating L SA spa c-es we simply use the corpora to compute word frequency.
 relations between the external measures used for experiments in Section 5, and time -to -maturity computed based on the two maturity metric s : the new fr equency -based maturity and the original LSA -based word maturity. The results indicate that the original LSA -based word maturity correlates better with real -world data than a maturity metric simply based on fr e-quency. 6.2 Homographs Another insight into the fact that the LSA -based word maturity metric tracks word meaning rather than mere freque ncy may be gained from analysis of words that are homographs : words that contain two or more unrelated meanings in the same wri t-ten form, such as the word  X  X urkey X  illustrated in Section 4. (This is related to but distinct from the merely polysemous words that have several related meanings), mean ings into the same orthographic form , hom o-graphs implicitly contain more semantic content in a single word. Therefore, one would expect the meaning of homographs to mature more slowly than would be predicted by frequency alone: all things being equal, a learner has to learn the mea n-ings for all of the senses of a homograph word before the word can be considered fully known. to -maturity of homographs to have greater values than words of similar frequency. To test this h y-pothesis, we obtained 8 a list 174 common English homographs. For each of them, we compared their time -to -maturity to the average time -to -maturity of words that have the same (+/ -1%) corpus fr e-quency. pothesis that the time -to -maturity of homographs is greater than other words of the same frequency , with the p -value = 5.9e -6 . This is consistent with the observati on that homographs will take longer to learn and serves as evidence that LSA -based word maturity approximates effects related to meaning. 6.3 Size of the Reference Corpus sions of the choice of the corpus for the re ference (adult) model. The size (and content) of the corpus used to train the reference model is potentially important, since it affects the word maturity calc u-lations, which are comparisons of the intermediate LSA spaces to the reference LSA space built o n this corpus. maturity model would be affected if the adult co r-pus were made significantly more sophisticated . If the word maturity metric were simply based on word frequency ( including the frequency -based ma turity baseline described in Section 6.1), one would expect the word maturi ty of the words at each level to decrease significantly if the reference model is made significantly larger, since each i n-termediate level will have encountered fewer words by compa rison . Intuition about language learning, however, tells us that with enough la n-guage exposure a learner learns virtually all there is to know about any particular word; after the word reaches its adult maturity, subsequent e n-counters of natural readings do little to further change the knowledge of that word. Therefore, if word maturi ty were tracking something similar to real word knowledge, one would expect the word maturity for most words to plateau over time, and subsequentl y not change significantly, no matter how sophisticated the reference model becomes. corpus that is twice as large as before (four times as large and of the same difficulty range as the corpus for the last i ntermediate level), containing roughly 329,000 passages. We computed the word maturity model using this larger reference corpus, while keeping all the original intermediate corpora of the same size and content. ty of words at the last intermediate level (14) d e-0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 creases by less than 14% as a result of doubling the adult corpus. Furthermore, this number is as low as 6%, if one only considers more common words that occur 50 times or more in the corpus . This relative ly small difference , in spite of a two -fold increas e of the adult corpus, is consistent with the idea that word knowledge should approach a plateau, after which further exposure to language does little to change most word meanings. 6.4 Integration into Lexicon Another important consideration with respect to word learning mentioned in Wotler (2001), is the  X  connections made between [a] particular word and the other words in the mental lexicon . X  One implication of that is that measuring word maturity must take in to account the way words in the la n-guage are integrated with other words.

 model by rearranging the order of some of the training passag es, by introducing certain advanced passages at a very early level . If the re sults of the word maturity metric were merely based on fr e-quency, such a reordering would have no effect on the maturity of important words ( measured after all the passages containing these words have been encountered), since the total number of relevant w ord encounters does not change a s a result of this reshuffling. If, however, the metric reflected at least some degree of semantics, we would expect word maturities for important words in these rea d-ings to be lower as a result of such rearranging, due to t he fact that they are being introduced in contexts consisti ng of words that are not well known at the early levels.
 es in the training corpus of intermediate models containing some advanced words from different topics, namely:  X  X hromosome X ,  X  X eutron X  and  X  X ilibuster X  togeth er with their plural variants. We changed the order of inclusion of these 89 passa g-es into the intermediate models in each of the two following ways : turity models, which were computed in all the same ways as before, except that all of these 89 advanced passages were introduced either at the very first level or at the very last level. We then computed the word maturity at the levels they were introduced. The hypothesis con sistent with a meaning -based maturity method would be that less learning (i.e. lower word maturity) of the relevant words will occur when passages are introduced prematurely (at level 1 ). Table 5 shows the word maturities measured for each of those cases, at the level ( 1 or 14 ) when all of the passages have been introduced.
 Indeed , the results show lower word maturity va l-ues when advanced pa ssages are introduced too early, and higher ones when the passages are i n-troduced at a later stage, when the rest of the su p-porting vocabula ry is known. We have introduced a new metric for estimating the degree of knowledge of words by learners at different levels . We have also proposed and eval u-ated an implementation of this metric using Latent Semantic Analysis.

Furthermore, we have shown that the metric is based on word meaning (to the extent that it can be approximated with LSA), and not merely on shallow measures like word fr equency. main pertaining to the best way to select and part i-tion the training corpora, align adult and intermediate LSA models, correlate the results with real school grade levels, as well as other free parameter s in the model. Nevertheless, we have shown that LSA can be employed to usefully mi m ic model word knowledge. The models are currently used (at Pearson Education) to create state -of -the -art personalized vocabulary instru c-tion and assessment tools.
