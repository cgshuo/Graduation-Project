The amount of data being produced in modern society is gro wing at an accelerating pace. Ne w problems and possibil-ities constantly arise from this so-called data explosion. One of the areas where information plays an important role is that of law enforcement. Ob viously , the amount of criminal data gives rise to man y problems in areas lik e data storage, data warehousing, data analysis and pri vacy. Already , numerous technological efforts are underw ay to gain insights into this information and to extract kno wledge from it.

This paper discusses a new tool that attempts to gain insights into the concept of criminal careers: the criminal acti vities that a single indi vidual exhibits throughout his or her life. The national police annually extracts information from digital narrati ve reports stored throughout the indi vidual departments and compiles this data into a lar ge and reasonably clean database that contains all criminal records from the last decade. From this database, our tool extracts the four important factors (see Section II) in criminal careers and establishes a clear picture on the dif ferent existing types of criminal careers by automatic clustering. All four factors need to be tak en into account and their relati ve relations need to be established in order to reach a reliable descripti ve image. To this end we propose a way of representing the criminal prole of an indi vidual in a single year . We then emplo y a specically designed distance measure to combine this prole with the number of crimes committed and the crime severity , and compare all possible couples of criminals. When this data has been compared throughout the available years we use a human centered clustering tool to represent the outcome to the police analysts. We discuss the dif culties in career -comparison and the specic distance measure we designed to cope with this kind of information.

The main contrib ution of this paper is in Section IV and V, where the criminal proles are established and the distance measure is introduced. A prototype test case of this research was described in [8].

The number of data mining projects in the law enforcement area is slo wly increasing. Both inside and outside of the academic world lar ge scale projects are underw ay. One of the lar ger academic projects is the COPLINK project, a police-uni versity collaboration in Arizona, where work has been done in the exploitation of data mining for cooperation purposes [4], the eld of entity extraction from narrati ve reports [5], and social netw ork analysis [6], [13]. The FLINTS project and FinCEN [9] aim at revealing links between crimes and criminals and to reveal mone y laundering netw orks by com-paring nancial transactions. Also, Oatly et al. [11] link ed burglary cases in the OVER project . Clustering techniques are also widely used in the law enforcement arena, lik e for example by Adderly and Musgro ve [1], who applied clustering techniques and Self Or ganizing Maps to model the beha vior of sex-of fenders, and by Cocx and Kosters [7] who made an attempt at clustering criminal investig ations to reveal what offenses were committed by the same group of criminals.
Our research aims to apply multi-dimensional clustering to criminal careers (rather than crimes or linking perpetrators) in order to constitute a visual representation of classes of these criminals.

Criminal careers have always been modelled through the ob-serv ation of specic groups of criminals. A more indi vidually oriented approach was suggested by Blumstein et al. [2]: little deniti ve kno wledge had been developed that could be applied to pre vent crime or to develop efcient policies for reacting to crime until the development of the criminal career paradigm. A criminal career is the characterization of a longitudinal sequence of crimes committed by an indi vidual offender . Participation in criminal acti vities is obviously restricted to a subset of the population, but by focussing on the subset of citizens who do become offenders, the y look ed at the frequency , seriousness and dur ation of their careers. We also focus our criminal career information on the natur e of such a career and emplo y data mining techniques to feed this information back to police analysts and criminologists.
Our criminal career analyzer (see Figure 1) is a multi-phase process that requires source les from the National Crime Record Database. From these les our tool extracts the four factors, mentioned in Section II, and establishes the criminal prole per offender . We then compare all indi viduals in the database and calculate a distance based upon this prole, crime severity and number of crimes. This information is summed over time and clustered using a human cen-tered multi-dimensional clustering approach. Black box ed, our paradigm reads in the National Crime Database and pro vides a visual career comparison report to the end user .
First, our tool normalises all careers to  X start X  on the same point in time, in order to better compare them. Second, we assign a prole to each indi vidual. This is done for each year in the database. After this step, that is described in more detail in Section IV, we compare all possible pairs of offenders on their proles for one year , while taking into account that seriousness is inherently link ed to certain proles. The resulting distance matrix is based upon only two of the four beforementioned criteria, crime nature and severity . We then emplo y a distance measure described in Section V to fairly incorporate the frequenc y of delinquent beha viour into our matrix which is then summed over the available years. In the last step we visualize our distance matrix in a 2-dimensional clustering image using the method described in [3].
The National Crime Record Database is an up-to-date source of information and therefore contains the current sit-uation. This does, howe ver, present us with the follo wing problem: it also contains the criminal acti vities of people that started their career near the end of the database' s range. Our approach suf fers from a lack of information on these offenders and when translated, it could be falsely assumed that their criminal acti vities terminated  X  howe ver, the y have just started. To cope with this problem we dra w a semi-arbitrary line after two years, which means we dot not tak e criminals into account that have only been acti ve for two years or less. In a later stage, it is presumably possible to predict in which direction the criminal careers of these offenders will unfold. More information about this prediction can be found in Section VII.

In the National Database of Crime Records the crimes of an indi vidual are split up into eight dif ferent types, varying from traf c and nancial infringements to violent and sex crimes. All these crimes have got an intrinsic seriousness attached to them.

Interpreting these types of crimes and compiling them into a criminal prole for indi vidual offenders is done both by determining the percentage of crimes in one year that fall into each one of the cate gories and dealing with these crimes' seriousness. The cate gories are then ordered on severity . Note that while all cate gories are considered to be dif ferent when determining prole, their respecti ve severity can be the same. We distinguish three types of crime seriousness: minor crimes, intermediate crimes and severe crimes. Each crime type falls within one of these cate gories. A typical prole of a person looks lik e the prole described in Table I. Summing all the values in a row in the table will result in 1, representing 100% of the crimes across the cate gories.

No w that we have established a way of representing the crime prole of an offender for a single year , it is possible to compare all indi viduals based upon this information and com-pile the prole distance matrix for each year . It is imperati ve that we tak e both the severity and nature of each prole into account.

We emplo y the method described in Table II to accomplish this. Between all couples of offenders we calculate the Prole Distance as follo ws. First we tak e the absolute dif ference between the respecti ve percentages in all cate gories and sum them to gain the dif ference between these two offenders in crime nature. This number varies between 0, if the nature of their crimes was exactly the same for the considered year , and 2 where both persons did not commit any crime in the same cate gory . An example of this can be seen in the top panel of Table II, with 0 : 6 as dif ference.

One of the problems that arise in this approach is how it should deal with people with no offenses in the considered year . In [8], it was assumed that setting all the percentages in the crime nature table to 0 would pro vide a result that was true to reality . This does not seem to be the case; such an assumption would pro vide smaller distances between offenders and  X innocent X  people, than between dif ferent kinds of criminals for an arbitrary year . It would be desirable to assign a maximal distance in crime nature between innocence and guilt. Hence we propose to add to this table the innocence column . An indi vidual without offences in the year under consideration would have a 1 in this eld, while an actual offender will always have committed 0% of his or her crimes of the innocent nature. This ensures that the algorithm will assign the desired maximal distance between these dif ferent types of persons.

Taking the severity of crimes into account is some what more comple x. Not only the dif ference within each severity class needs to be calculated, but also the dif ference between classes. For example, an offender committing only minor crimes has a less similar career to a severe crime offender , than a perpetrator of the intermediate class would have to the same severe criminal. In compliance with this fact, our approach introduces a weighting factor for the three dif ferent cate gories. Minor offences get a weight of 1, intermediate crimes get multiplied by 2 and the most extreme cases are multiplied by 3. Of course, these values are some what arbitrary , but the fact that the y are linear establishes a reasonably representati ve and understandable algorithm. This multiplication is done for each indi vidual and is summed over all severity classes before the dif ference between couples is evaluated. Ob viously this will yield a greater distance between a small time criminal and a murderer ( j 1  X  1  X  3  X  1 j = 2 , which is also the maximum) than between an intermediate perpetrator and that same killer ( j 2  X  1  X  3  X  1 j = 1 ). Naturally , two indi viduals with the same beha vior , still exhibit a distance of 0. An example of this calculation can be found in the bottom panel of Table II, with value 0 : 3 .

Naturally , the innocence cate gory in crime nature will be assigned a severity factor of 0, stating that a minor criminal (for example: theft) will be more similar to an innocent person than a murderer would be, when looking at crime severity .
Both these concepts will ultimately culminate into the follo wing formula: where the prole distance per year between person x and y is denoted as PD xy , the percentage of person x in crime cate gory a is described as Per c ax , and Sev bx points to the severity class b of person x , with attached multiplication factor Fact b . This formula yields a maximum of 5 (the maxima of both concepts summed) and naturally a minimum of 0. In the example from Table II we would get 0 : 6 + 0 : 3 = 0 : 9 .

As an example of our approach we look at the follo wing situation for an arbitrary year: First we calculate the dif ference between all four offenders in both crime nature and crime severity . This pro vides the follo wing table.
 We can now easily calculate the Prole Dif ference between the offenders. The result can be seen in Figure 2.

We clearly observ e from this gure that the innocent person from our list has a lar ge distance from all offenders, varying from 3 to the bic ycle thief to 5 to the murderer . As one would expect, the distances between respecti vely the thief and the thief-murderer and the murderer and the thief-murderer are rather small.

The intermediate result we have calculated describes the dif-ference in prole and crime seriousness between all indi viduals in the database. This distance matrix will be used as input for our main distance measure that will add crime frequenc y to the equation.

The values the PD can get assigned are clearly bounded by 0 and 5. This is, howe ver, not the case with the crime frequenc y of the number of crimes per year . This can vary from 0 to an undened but possibly very lar ge number of offences in a single year . To get a controlled range of possible distances between indi vidual careers it is desirable to discretize this range into smaller cate gories. Intuiti vely , beyond a certain number of crimes, the dif ference that one single crime mak es is almost insignicant. Therefore we propose to divide the number of crimes into cate gories. These cate gories will divide the crime frequenc y space and assign a discrete value FV (the frequency value ) which will then be used as input for our distance measure. The cate gories we propose are described in Table V. Using this table the number of crimes value is bounded by 0 and 4, while the cate gories maintain an intuiti ve treatment of both one-time offenders and career criminals. Naturally , the absolute dif ference FVD xy between two indi viduals x and y also ranges from 0 to 4.

The sum of PD and FVD seems an obvious choice for a distance measure, but is not suf cient to fully describe the actual underlying principles. A lar ge part of the National Crime Record Database contains one-time offenders. Their respecti ve criminal careers are obviously reasonably similar , although their single crimes may dif fer lar gely in cate gory or severity class. Ho we ver, when looking into the careers of career criminals there are only minor dif ferences to be ob-serv ed in crime frequenc y and therefore the descripti ve value of prole becomes more important (cf. [2]). Consequently , the theoretical dependence of the PD on the crime frequenc y must become more apparent in our distance measure. To this end we will multiply the prole oriented part of our distance measure with the average frequenc y value and divide it by 4, to regain our original range between 0 and 5. Hence, the distance measure that calculates the car eer dif fer ence per year CDPY xy for offenders x and y is as follo ws:
Dividing by 9, as is done abo ve, will result in a distance between 0 and 1 for all pairs of offenders, which is standard for a distance matrix. If one of PD xy or FVD xy is 0, the other establishes the distance  X  as expected. Usage of this distance measure will result in a distance matrix that contains all distances per year for all couples of criminals. The nal preparation step will consist of calculation of all these matrices for all available years and incorporating the duration of the careers. No w that we have dened a measure CDPY ( i ) compare two persons x and y in a particular year i , we can combine this into a measure to compare full  X careers X . The simplest option is to use where years is the total number of years. This option is further explored in [8]. The idea can be easily generalized to where the weights w ( i ) must satisfy P years instance, the rst year might have a low weight. Of course, dist1 is retrie ved when choosing w ( i ) = 1 = years for all
Two problems arise from this situation. The rst is that careers may be the same, but  X stretched X . Two criminals can commit the same crimes, in the same order , but in a dif ferent time period. This may or may not be vie wed as a dif ferent career . On the one hand it is only the order of the crimes that counts, on the other hand the time in between also matters. The second is that if a criminal does not commit a crime in a given year , the distance to others (for that year) will be in some sense dif ferent from that between two acti ve criminals.
In order to address these remarks, we propose a str etc h factor  X  S , with  X  S  X  0 . This factor can be set or changed by the career analyst if he or she feels that the pro vided result does not fully represent reality . If  X  S = 0 we retrie ve the original measure, if  X  S is high man y years can be contracted into a single one. To formally dene our measure, we look at two careers, where for simplicity we use capitals A , B , to indicate dif ferent crime types, and use multiset notation to specify the crimes in each year (so, e.g., f A; A; B g refers to a year where two A -crimes and one B -crime were committed). Suppose we have the follo wing 7 year careers x and y of two criminals: The second career may be vie wed as a some what stretched version of the rst one, The dif ferences are: x has two A the rst year , whereas y has only one; x has the singleton set f C g in year 2, whereas y has f D g in year 3; and year 6 from y is spread among year 4 and 5 of x . Evidently we are looking for some sort of edit distance .

No w we tak e  X  S 2 f 0 ; 1 ; 2 ; : : : g and collapse at most years, for both careers, where we add ; s to the right. Note that, when collapsing two sets, it is important to decide whether or not to use multisets. For instance, with  X  S = 2 , we might change y to If we have t years, there are ways to change a single career; by the way, man y of them give the same result. For the abo ve example, with t = 7 and  X 
S = 2 , this gives 22 possibilities, and therefore 22  X  22 = 484 possible combinations of the two careers. We now tak e the smallest distance between two of these as the nal distance. For the example this would be realized through So nally the distance of x and y is determined by the distance between the singleton sets f C g and f D g , and the way how the multiset f A; A; B g compares to f A; B g . This last issue can be easily solv ed in the basic computation of PD , discussed in Section IV.

Of course, there are other practical considerations. For instance, some (perhaps even man y) crimes will go unnoticed by police forces, giving an incorrect vie w. Furthermore, in the current approach there is a clear , but maybe unw anted separation between crimes committed in December and in January of the next year .

The standard construction of our distance matrix en-abled our tool to emplo y existing techniques to create a 2-dimensional clustering image. The intermediate Euclidean distances in this image correspond as good as possible to the distances in the original matrix. Earlier research [7] sho wed that automated clustering methods with human interv ention might get promising results. The method that we incorporated in our tool was described by Broek ens et al. [3], who built upon the push and pull architecture described in [10], and allo ws data analysts to correct small mistak es made by nai ve clustering algorithms that result in local optima. The user is assisted by coloring of the nodes that represent how much a single indi vidual or a collection of indi viduals contrib ute to the total error made in the current clustering. The end result is a clickable 2-dimensional image of all possible careers. When the user clicks on an indi vidual he or she is presented with the prole information for that particular offender .
It is very well possible to use the abo ve mentioned method for prediction. Though we have not experimented with this yet, we would lik e to briey mention some possibilities and problems.

Once a (lar ge) group of criminals has been analyzed, it is possible to predict future beha vior of new indi viduals. To this end we can readily use the tool from [3]. Suppose that the given database has already been con verted into a 2-dimensional clustering diagram, as described in Section VI. We can and will assume that the original database consists of  X full X  careers. For a new partially lled career , e.g., consisting of only two consecuti ve years with crimes, we can compute its distance to all original ones taking into account only the number of years of the new career . The system now tak es care of nding the right spot for this indi vidual, where it reaches a local minimum for the distances in the 2-dimensional space in comparison with the computed distances. The neighbouring indi viduals will then pro vide some information on the possible future beha vior of the newly added career; this information is of a statistical nature.

Of course, in practice it is not always clear when a career ends, not to speak of situations where a career ends or seems to end prematurely , e.g., because a criminal dies or is in prison for a substantial time period.
 We tested our tool on the actual Dutch National Criminal Record Database. This database contains approximately one million offenders and the crimes the y committed. Our tool analyzed the entire set of criminals and presented the user with a clear 2-dimensional clustering of criminal careers as can be seen in Figure 3. The condential nature of the data used for criminal career analysis pre vents us from disclosing more detailed experimental results reached in our research.
The image in Figure 3 gives an impression of the output produced by our tool when analyzing the beforementioned database. This image sho ws what identication could easily be coupled to the appearing clusters after examination of its members. It appears to be describing reality very well. The lar ge  X cloud X  in the left-middle of the image contains (most of the) one-time offenders. This seems to relate to the database very well since approximately 75 % of the people it contains has only one felon y or misdemeanour on his or her record. The other apparent clusters also represent clear subsets of offenders. There is howe ver a reasonably lar ge group of  X un-clustered indi viduals X . The clustering of these indi vidual criminal careers might be inuenced by the lar ge cluster of one-timers. Getting more insights into the possible existence of subgroups in this non-cluster may pro ve even more interesting than the results currently pro vided by our approach. Future research will focus on getting this impro vement realized (cf. Section IX).

In this paper we demonstrated the applicability of data mining in the eld of criminal career analysis. The tool we described compiled a criminal prole out of the four impor -tant factors describing a criminal career for each indi vidual offender: frequenc y, seriousness, duration and nature. These proles were compared on similarity for all possible pairs of criminals using a new comparison method. We developed a specic distance measure to combine this prole dif ference with crime frequenc y and the change of criminal beha vior over time to create a distance matrix that describes the amount of variation in criminal careers between all couples of perpetrators. This distance measure incorporates intuiti ve peculiarities about criminal careers. The end report consists of a visual 2-dimensional clustering of the results and is ready to be used by police experts.

The enormous  X cloud X  of one-time offenders gave a some-what unclear situational sketch of our distance space. This problem, howe ver, can not be easily addressed since a lar ge part of the National Criminal Record Database simply consists of this type of offenders. Its existence sho ws, howe ver, that our approach easily creates an identiable cluster of this special type of criminal career , which is promising. One possible solution to this problem would be to simply not tak e these indi viduals into account when compiling our distance matrices.
The used method of clustering pro vided results that seem to represent reality well, and are clearly usable by police analysts, especially when the abo ve is tak en into account. Ho we ver, the runtime of the chosen approach was not optimal yet. The clustering method was too intensi ve in a computational way, causing delays in the performance of the tool. In the future, an approach lik e Progressi ve Multi Dimensional Scaling [12] could be more suited to the proposed task in a computati ve way, while maintaining the essence of career analysis.
Future research will aim at solving both concerns mentioned abo ve. After these issues have been properly addressed, re-search will mainly focus on the automatic comparison between the results pro vided by our tool and the results social studies reached on the same subject, in the hope that  X the best of both worlds X  will reach even better analyzing possibilities for the police experts in the eld. Incorporation of this tool in a data mining frame work for automatic police analysis of their data sources is also a future topic of interest.
