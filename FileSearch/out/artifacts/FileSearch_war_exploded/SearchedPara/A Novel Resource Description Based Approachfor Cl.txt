 File sharing is an important application of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Systems. With more and more text documents being sha red, there ought to be some effective information retrieval mechanisms in th ese text-document-sharing P2P applica-tions.
 topic , similar documents . The document collections which are made up of similar documents are called as similar collections and the peers which own similar col-to discover useful resources and prune the s earching space. Therefore, clustering similar peers will benefit information retrieval in P2P systems.
 source description [1] of the document collection i n a peer. The similarity between two peers is determined by the similarity between their resource description. weighted term list to describe the docume nt collection. The basic technique to determine the term weight is based on Topic Model [2], an extension of Language Model [3]. After building the resource description, we borrow the fuzzy correlation coefficient from fuzzy clustering [4] to deduce the similarities among different peers. The experiments and experimental res ults are discussed in Section 3. We con-clude the whole paper in Section 4. 2.1 Background In essence, Language model suggests a new method to describe the relations between terms and documents, i.e., we can consider that a term t is generated by the model of the document d in which it appears. As showed in Formula (1), the generation relationship is defined as a conditional probability p ( t | M d )[3]: consider that the selected terms in the re source description are generated by a unified model of T , i.e. the Topic Model ( M T ) [2]. Suppose that d j is a document from the document collection C with topic T . Because d j is about T ,weconsider according to the following formula: of documents in C with T . In fact, we use the expected value of the samples of p ( t i | M T ) as its estimate.
 where n is the vocabulary size of d j . In essence, this method use the maximum likelihood estate as the estate of p ( t i | M T ). 2.2 Generate the Resource Description Term Selection. According to our observation, the words that are important to the topic will have higher document frequency. Hence, We select the words as the terms to construct the resource description according to following rules: where df ( t i ,C ) is the document frequency of term t i and DFT is a predefined threshold. Fig.1 shows an example where DFT = 2. In this example, word t 2 only appear in one document d 2 , so it is filtered out from the term list. Weight Calculation. In fact, the relationship between a term and a topic is a typical fuzzy relation . In our implement, we take the topic of a document collection C as a fuzzy set T and the terms in C as the elements of T .The membership function ( F ( t i , T )  X  [0 , 1]) defines the weight of term  X  p C .If t i /  X  C , p ( t i | M T )=0  X  w i =0.
 2.3 Calculate the Similarity Just as what has been mentioned, we map the topic of a document collection to a fuzzy set T . Hence, we can deduce the similarity between two peers peer i and peer j by using the fuzzy correlation coefficient between two fuzzy variables T i and T j sim ( peer i , peer j )  X   X   X  ( T terms from peer i . m is the cardinality of UT , which is a union term set of TS i (term set of the resource description of peer i )and TS j (term set of the resource description of peer j ). For term t m  X  ( UT  X  TS i ), w im = 0. Analogously, for term t n  X  ( UT  X  TS j ) ,w jn =0.
 and grouping them into peer clusters is a fuzzy clustering [4] process. To our best knowledge, it is our innovation to judge the similarities among peers by combining fuzzy sets theory an d language model techniques.
 3.1 Data Sets We performed our experiments in two data sets: Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) [5] and TREC 5 (disk 5) [6]. In RCV1, the topic information was di-rectly used as the topic of the peer in ou r experiments. In TREC5, we used the domain information in the routine task as the topics. 3.2 Experiment Design Four test beds were constructed by using the two data sets. Table 1 lists the information of the four test beds. Fore each test bed, we have simulated a file sharing P2P system.
 rithm [7]. We use FMeasure [7] to measure the cluster quality: The higher the cluster quality is, the closer is F ( T i , C j )to1. generation scheme in clustering similar peers. We try to clarify the influences of term selection scheme and the weight c alculation method on peer clustering. We also compare the effectiveness of our approach ( topic model -based approach, tm approach ) with that of the traditional approach directly based statistical information ( term frequency -based approach, tf approach ) in peer clustering. 3.3 Experimental Data In our implement of K-means algorithm, resource descriptions (weighted term lists) are taken as the vectors; the weights of the terms are the corresponding coordinates in the vector. All the vectors are normalized. In tm approach ,the distance function in K-means algorithm is Formula(6). In tf approach ,cos( v i , v j ) is used as the distance function.
 Evaluation of Resource Description Generation Scheme. Table 2 shows the influence of the different DFTs and different P ( t i | M T ) estimation methods on the accuracy of the c lustered results. FMeasure in each test bed is the average value of the FMeasure s of the topics in the corresponding test bed. DF 2 means is used as the estimate of P ( t i | M T ).
 ing of DFT. The maximum dropping rate is around 1 . 7%. In every testbed,  X  p Comparing with the Approach Based on the Statistical Method. Tra-is adopted to select terms. Words were sorted according to their tf ( t i ,C )inthe document collection and the top n words were selected to construct the term list. The weight of the selected term is log ( tf ( t i ,C )+1). The value of n will affect the accuracy in clustering. Accord ing to [8], what we found is that when n = 2000  X  4000, there was no significant difference in the clustering results. When n  X  1000, the performance degraded obviously.
 finding similar peers. In the tm approach , the standard to select term is DFT = 6. The standard in tf -based approach is n = 2500. Table 3 shows the results of the comparative experiments. Our mechanism performed better in RCV1-2 , RCV1-3 and TREC5 . Especially in TREC5 , our mechanism significantly surpassed the tf approach . In this paper, we suggest a resource description-based mechanism to clustering similar peers in P2P systems. We solved the problems about resource generation and peer similarity calculation. One contribution of our work is that we man-age to get more accurate term weight by combining the topic model technique and fuzzy set theory in resource generation. The other contribution is that we infer the similarity between peers by the fuzzy correlation coefficients between fuzzy variables . Our experiments proved that our approach is more effective in clustering peers than the traditional approach which directly utilizes the term statistical information.
