Geographic information retrieval (GIR) concerns the re-trieval of thematically and geographically relevant informa-tion resources in response to a query of the form &lt; theme or topic, spatial relationship, location &gt; , e.g.  X  X ebellions in Singapore X . [4, 3]. Systems that support GIR, such as geo-graphic digital libraries, and location-aware web search en-gines, are based on a collection of georeferenced information resources and methods to spatially search these resources with geographic location as a key. Information resources are considered georeferenced if they are spatially indexed by one or more regions on the surface of the Earth, where the specific locations of these regions are encoded either di-rectly as spatial coordinates, i.e. geometrically, or indirectly by place name[2]. However, in order for place names to sup-port a spatial approach to GIR, they must be associated with a model of geographic space.

We will present a system that combines conventional prob-abilistic algorithms for text retrieval with novel probabilistic algorithms for estimating relevance for geographic spaces. We will also demonstrate our algorithm for GIR ranking that estimates probability of relevance based on a weighted set of parameters where the weights were derived using lo-gistic regression from samples of a test collection[1].
We will show how graphical geospatial query specifica-tions (via panning and zooming in Google Earth) can be used to obtain sets of geospatial data ranked by probability of relevance, and how those data can be displayed geograph-ically and temporally in a geospatial browser with temporal support (also Google Earth as shown in Figure 1).
