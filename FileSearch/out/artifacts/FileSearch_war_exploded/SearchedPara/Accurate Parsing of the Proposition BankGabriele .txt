 Recent successes in statistical syntactic parsing based on supervised techniques trained on a large corpus of syntactic trees (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Henderson, 2003) have brought the hope that the same approach could be applied to the more am-bitious goal of recovering the propositional content and the frame semantics of a sentence. Moving to-wards a shallow semantic level of representation has immediate applications in question-answering and information extraction. For example, an automatic flight reservation system processing the sentence I want to book a flight from Geneva to New York will need to know that from Geneva indicates the origin of the flight and to New York the destination. (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) define this shallow semantic task as a classification problem where the semantic role to be assigned to each constituent is inferred on the basis of probability distributions of syntactic features extracted from parse trees. They use learning features such as phrase type, position, voice, and parse tree path. Consider, for example, a sentence such as The authority dropped at mid-night Tuesday to $ 2.80 trillion (taken from section 00 of PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005)). The fact that to $ 2.80 trillion receives a direction semantic label is highly correlated to the fact that it is a Preposi-tional Phrase (PP), that it follows the verb dropped , a verb of change of state requiring an end point, that the verb is in the active voice, and that the PP is in a certain tree configuration with the governing verb. All the recent systems proposed for semantic role la-belling (SRL) follow this same assumption (CoNLL, 2005).

The assumption that syntactic distributions will be predictive of semantic role assignments is based on linking theory. Linking theory assumes the ex-istence of a hierarchy of semantic roles which are mapped by default on a hierarchy of syntactic po-sitions. It also shows that regular mappings from the semantic to the syntactic level can be posited even for those verbs whose arguments can take sev-eral syntactic positions, such as psychological verbs, locatives, or datives, requiring a more complex the-ory. (See (Hale and Keyser, 1993; Levin and Rappa-port Hovav, 1995) among many others.) If the inter-nal semantics of a predicate determines the syntactic expressions of constituents bearing a semantic role, it is then reasonable to expect that knowledge about semantic roles in a sentence will be informative of its syntactic structure, and that learning semantic role labels at the same time as parsing will be beneficial to parsing accuracy.

We present work to test the hypothesis that a cur-rent statistical parser (Henderson, 2003) can output rich information comprising both a parse tree and semantic role labels robustly, that is without any sig-nificant degradation of the parser X  X  accuracy on the original parsing task. We achieve promising results both on the simple parsing task, where the accuracy of the parser is measured on the standard Parseval measures, and also on the parsing task where more complex labels comprising both syntactic labels and semantic roles are taken into account.

These results have several consequences. First, we show that it is possible to build a single inte-grated system successfully. This is a meaningful achievement, as a task combining semantic role la-belling and parsing is more complex than simple syntactic parsing. While the shallow semantics of a constituent and its structural position are often correlated, they sometimes diverge. For example, some nominal temporal modifiers occupy an object position without being objects, like Tuesday in the Penn Treebank representation of the sentence above. The indirectness of the relation is also confirmed by the difficulty in exploiting semantic information for parsing. Previous attempts have not been success-ful. (Klein and Manning, 2003) report a reduction in parsing accuracy of an unlexicalised PCFG from 77.8% to 72.9% in using Penn Treebank function la-bels in training. The two existing systems that use function labels sucessfully, either inherit Collins X  modelling of the notion of complement (Gabbard, Kulick and Marcus, 2006) or model function labels directly (Musillo and Merlo, 2005). Furthermore, our results indicate that the proposed models are ro-bust. To model our task accurately, additional pa-rameters must be estimated. However, given the cur-rent limited availability of annotated treebanks, this more complex task will have to be solved with the same overall amount of data, aggravating the diffi-culty of estimating the model X  X  parameters due to sparse data. In this section we describe the augmentations to our base parsing models necessary to tackle the joint learning of parse tree and semantic role labels.
PropBank encodes propositional information by adding a layer of argument structure annotation to the syntactic structures of the Penn Treebank (Mar-cus et al., 1993). Verbal predicates in the Penn Tree-bank (PTB) receive a label REL and their arguments are annotated with abstract semantic role labels A0-A5 or AA for those complements of the predicative verb that are considered arguments while those com-plements of the verb labelled with a semantic func-tional label in the original PTB receive the com-posite semantic role label AM-X , where X stands for labels such as LOC, TMP or ADV, for locative, temporal and adverbial modifiers respectively. Prop-Bank uses two levels of granularity in its annotation, at least conceptually. Arguments receiving labels A0-A5 or AA do not express consistent semantic roles and are specific to a verb, while arguments re-ceiving an AM-X label are supposed to be adjuncts, and the roles they express are consistent across all verbs.

To achieve the complex task of assigning seman-tic role labels while parsing, we use a family of state-of-the-art history-based statistical parsers, the Simple Synchrony Network (SSN) parsers (Hender-son, 2003), which use a form of left-corner parse strategy to map parse trees to sequences of deriva-tion steps. These parsers do not impose any a pri-ori independence assumptions, but instead smooth their parameters by means of the novel SSN neu-ral network architecture. This architecture is ca-pable of inducing a finite history representation of an unbounded sequence of derivation steps, which we denote h ( d h ( d 1 , . . . , d i  X  1 ) is computed from a set f of hand-crafted features of the derivation move d from a finite set D of recent history representations h ( d 1 , . . . , d j ) , where j &lt; i  X  1 . Because the his-tory representation computed for the move i  X  1 is included in the inputs to the computation of the representation for the next move i , virtually any in-formation about the derivation history could flow from history representation to history representation and be used to estimate the probability of a deriva-tion move. In our experiments, the set D of ear-lier history representations is modified to yield a model that is sensitive to regularities in structurally defined sequences of nodes bearing semantic role labels, within and across constituents. For more information on this technique to capture structural domains, see (Musillo and Merlo, 2005) where the technique was applied to function parsing. Given the hidden history representation h ( d a derivation, a normalized exponential output func-tion is computed by the SSNs to estimate a proba-bility distribution over the possible next derivation moves d
To exploit the intuition that semantic role labels are predictive of syntactic structure, we must pro-vide semantic role information as early as possible to the parser. Extending a technique presented in (Klein and Manning, 2003) and adopted in (Merlo and Musillo, 2005) for function labels with state-of-the-art results, we split some part-of-speech tags into tags marked with AM-X semantic role labels. As a result, 240 new POS tags were introduced to partition the original tag set which consisted of 45 tags. Our augmented model has a total of 613 non-terminals to represent both the PTB and PropBank labels, instead of the 33 of the original SSN parser. The 580 newly introduced labels consist of a stan-dard PTB label followed by one or more PropBank semantic roles, such as PP-AM-TMP or NP-A0-A1. These augmented tags and the new non-terminals are included in the set f , and will influence bottom-up projection of structure directly.

These newly introduced fine-grained labels frag-ment our PropBank data. To alleviate this problem, we enlarge the set f with two additional binary fea-tures. One feature decides whether a given preter-minal or nonterminal label is a semantic role label belonging to the set comprising the labels A0-A5 and AA. The other feature indicates if a given la-bel is a semantic role label of type AM-X , or oth-erwise. These features allow the SSN to generalise in several ways. All the constituents bearing an A0-A5 and AA labels will have a common feature. The same will be true for all nodes bearing an AM-X la-bel. Thus, the SSN can generalise across these two types of labels. Finally, all constituents that do not bear any label will now constitute a class, the class of the nodes for which these two features are false. Our extended semantic role SSN parser was trained on sections 2-21 and validated on section 24 from the PropBank. Testing data are section 23 from the CoNLL-2005 shared task (Carreras and Marquez, 2005).

We perform two different evaluations on our model trained on PropBank data. We distinguish be-tween two parsing tasks: the PropBank parsing task and the PTB parsing task. To evaluate the former parsing task, we compute the standard Parseval mea-sures of labelled recall and precision of constituents, taking into account not only the 33 original labels, but also the newly introduced PropBank labels. This evaluation gives us an indication of how accurately and exhaustively we can recover this richer set of non-terminal labels. The results, computed on the testing data set from the PropBank, are shown in the PropBank column of Table 1, first line. To evaluate the PTB task, we ignore the set of PropBank seman-tic role labels that our model assigns to constituents (PTB column of Table 1, first line to be compared to the third line of the same column).

To our knowledge, no results have yet been pub-is not possible to draw a straightforward quantita-tive comparison between our PropBank SSN parser and other PropBank parsers. However, state-of-the-art semantic role labelling systems (CoNLL, 2005) use parse trees output by state-of-the-art parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000), both for training and testing, and return partial trees annotated with semantic role labels. An indirect way of compar-ing our parser with semantic role labellers suggests mantic role labeller with the output of the parser on which it was trained, and compute PropBank parsing performance measures on the resulting parse trees. The third line, PropBank column of Table 1 reports such measures summarised for the five best seman-tic role labelling systems (Punyakanok et al., 2005b; Haghighi et al., 2005; Pradhan et al., 2005; Mar-quez et al., 2005; Surdeanu and Turmo, 2005) in the CoNLL 2005 shared task. These systems all use (Charniak, 2000) X  X  parse trees both for train-ing and testing, as well as various other information sources including sets of n -best parse trees, chunks, or named entities. Thus, the partial trees output by these systems were merged with the parse trees re-turned by Charniak X  X  parser (second line, PropBank
These results jointly confirm our initial hypothe-Table 1: Percentage F-measure of our SSN parser on PTB and PropBank parsing, compared to the origi-nal SSN parser and to the best CoNLL 2005 SR la-bellers. sis. The performance on the parsing task (PTB col-umn) does not appreciably deteriorate compared to a current state-of-the-art parser, even if our learner can output a much richer set of labels, and there-fore solves a considerably more complex problem, suggesting that the relationship between syntactic PTB parsing and semantic PropBank parsing is strict enough that an integrated approach to the problem of semantic role labelling is beneficial. Moreover, the results indicate that we can perform the more complex PropBank parsing task at levels of accuracy comparable to those achieved by the best seman-tic role labellers (PropBank column). This indicates that the model is robust, as it has been extended to a richer set of labels successfully, without increase in training data. In fact, the limited availability of data is increased further by the high variability of the ar-gumental labels A0-A5 whose semantics is specific to a given verb or a given verb sense.

Methodologically, these initial results on a joint solution to parsing and semantic role labelling pro-vide the first direct test of whether parsing is neces-sary for semantic role labelling (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Punyakanok et al., 2005a). Comparing se-mantic role labelling based on chunked input to the better semantic role labels retrieved based on parsed trees, (Gildea and Palmer, 2002) conclude that pars-ing is necessary. In an extensive experimental in-vestigation of the different learning stages usually involved in semantic role labelling, (Punyakanok et al., 2005a) find instead that sophisticated chunking can achieve state-of-the-art results. Neither of these pieces of work actually used a parser to do SRL. Their investigation was therefore limited to estab-lishing the usefulness of syntactic features for the SRL task. Our results do not yet indicate that pars-ing is beneficial to SRL, but they show that the joint task can be performed successfully.
