 ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ 1. INTRODUCTION In Japan, politeness plays an important role in social activities, especially in conversation. expressions is essential to facilitate smoo th communication. In fact, most entrance examinations and entry-level training programs at Japanese companies include the correct use of these expressions (and education on this subject has been increasing). 
Although many textbooks on Japanese honorific expressions have been published recently, they are not necessarily consiste nt with what many people know about but linguistic norms have changed over time. So to understand how normative honorific practical knowledge must be investigated. 
The main purpose of our study is to examine use of normative honorific expressions in textbooks and to compare it to the way people use them. First, we reviewed the types of mentioned above. Based on these reviews, we introduced as the framework of our study a model to identify the misuse of honorific expressions in a sentence. We then, via provided in textbooks and by younger and older people. Our model will be useful in the development of computer-aided systems to help teach how honorific expressions should be used. 2. MISUSE OF HONORIFIC EXPRESSIONS 2.1 Types of Honorific Expressions types. 1 o/go (prefixes) + verb stems + auxiliary verbs. The auxiliary verb nasaru can be used in included because kun is an exception in that it is an honorific title that does not indicate politeness. forms of verbs; (2) verb stems + auxiliary verbs; and (3) o/go (prefixes) + verb stems + only. auxiliary verb such as desu/masu/gozaimasu at the end of a sentence. "two-directional honorific expression." 2.2 Categories of Misuse The misuse of honorific expressions can be divided into two principal categories. form differs from the normative word forms mentioned in Section 2.1. For example, o (a prefix) + verb stem + rareru (an auxiliary verb) is a mi suse of word form because rareru ninaru . performance when the social position of the liste ner is higher than that of the speaker. We may think that other factors such as social distance (e.g., familiarity) between persons and affect the choice of honorific expressions [Goffman 1967; Grundy 1995]. Actually, category 2 mistakes. 
Although the misuse of word fo rms (category 1) is considered as serious as category 2 errors, those in category 1 invo lve simple mistakes in speech patterns. Thus it is possible to avoid making category 1 mistakes by simply preparing a list of normative and/or non-present study concentrates on category 2 problems only. 3. FRAMEWORK honorific expressions in a given sentence. 3.1 Restrictions The model deals with sentences that satisfy the following restrictions: (1) Four people  X  a speaker, a listener, and two other persons (referred to as "A" and "B")  X  are involved. (2) Only one predicate, whose subject and object are person A and person B, respectively, is included. The first restriction is not very strict, since five or more persons are rarely involved in a sentence, except in extremely complicated conversations. The model requires that we simple so that we do not have to incorporate a parsing program into the model because as yet there is no parsing program that can accurately identify the subject and object persons of each predicate in complicated sentences. 3.2 Model Input and Output The input is a sentence and a position label. The input sentence corresponds to a speech label. The position label consists of symbols S, L, A, and B, which represent the speaker, the listener, person A, and person B, respectively. In the position label the social position former person appears to the left of the symbol corresponding to the latter person. There are 24 variations in the position label (the nu mber of permutations of the four symbols). san (a honorific title that means Mr./Ms.); ga (a postpositional particle that indicates the means Mr./Ms.); ni (a postpositional particle that means  X  X o X ); osshatta (respectful form of a verb, meaning  X  X poke X ); sou (a stem of an auxiliary verb, meaning  X 'I heard that' X ); sentence corresponds to the following speech intention  X  X  heard that Mr./Ms. A spoke to positions of person A, person B, the listener, and the speaker decrease, in that order. 
The model outputs any misuse in a sentence. If misuse is found, the model also outputs found in the sentence "A san ga B san ni osshatta sou da ," and points out the details of the misuse: that is, that the honorific type of the auxiliary verb at the end of the sentence polite (e.g., desu ) because the social position of the listener is higher than the speaker. 3.3 Honorific Patterns in Input Sentences Section 3.1, the honorific features of the sent ences can be represented by the set of values A, B, E, and P, whose values are assigned by Table I. honorific pattern. For example, the honorific pattern "A san ga B san ni osshatta sou da ," honorific type of the predicate ( osshatta ) is respectful but not humble. 3.4 Algorithm Figure 2 shows the flowchart of the model. The process consists of the following steps: Japanese morphological analysis program [Matsumoto 1999]. table). If any misuse is found, proceed to Step 2-1; otherwise, proceed to Step 2-2. corresponding to the partial rows that have misuses in word form. Then quit the process . honorific dictionary (upper portion of Table II), and then determine the values of honorific elements A, B, E, and P (this organizes the honorific pattern) by using the value assignment rule shown in Table I. section.
 the portions of the input sentence correspondi ng to honorific elemen ts whose values are not consistent with the position label and the honorific types of these honorific elements. 3.5 Consistency Table from Textbooks labels (24 variations in total, as mentioned in Section 3.2) and honorific patterns that are position labels (except LBAS, BALS, BLAS, and BASL, each of which has two the alternatives). 
Table III was obtained from textbooks on Japanese honorific expressions. We assumed 12 speech intentions (Table IV) to obtain and evaluate Table III. Speech intentions (1) to prepared several variations of speech intentio ns so that we could investigate whether the adopted based on two criteria: table through the following procedure:  X  Step 1. More than three training sets were prepared for each kind of position label sentences were extracted from textbooks on Japanese honorific expressions [Hagino 2001; Hoshino et al. 1993; Horikawa et al. 1969; Kikuchi 1996; Kikuchi 1997; Matsuoka et al. 1989; Moriyama 2000; Mi zutani 1995; Watanabe 1971]. Because it was difficult to we composed the other sentences while trying to follow the textbook examples as much as possible. 4 together with the position label in the training sets were listed. 
Step 3. All the lists obtained in step 2 were tabulated so that each position label and the the table. All six of the consistency tables (one for each of the speech intentions in (1) to (6) in was not affected by variations in the speech intentions in the experiments. 3.6 Validity Check of the Consistency Table Using Textbooks We verified Table III using two kinds of test sets. contained examples of misuse in performance (i.e., category 2). In the latter case, we consistency table as described in Sections 3.4 and 3.5. More than one test set of each kind, each with the same format as the training set explained in Section 3.5, was prepared for each of the position labels (24 va riations in total) for each of the speech intentions --(7) to (12) in Table IV--via a procedure similar to one used to prepare the training sets. 
The above test sets were given to the model one by one. The model did not erroneously point out any misuse in the first kind of test set, but correctly pointed out all the portions and kinds of misuse in test sets of the other kind. textbooks regarding Japanese honorific expressions. 3.7 The Summarized Consistency Table from Textbooks listener, person A, and person B are partially related to the limited honorific elements. 
Table III can be summarized as Table V (t he summarized consistency table). Table V was obtained by executing the following steps fo r each of the honorific elements A, B, E, and P. The values of honorific elements A, B, and E are each 0/1, and the values of the labels LBAS, BALS, BLAS, and BASL and P= 1 does not correspond to these position labels in step 1. elements in Table III. observed in all the position labels of the grou p, but not observed in the position labels of other groups at all, where the "partial relativ e position" represents the order among two or expression of X&gt;Y, where X&gt;Y means that sym bol X appears to the left of symbol Y in the position label (X, Y= S, L, A or B, wher e X differs from Y). So X&gt;Y means that the social position of the person corresponding to symbol X is higher than that corresponding the partial relative position. Step 1, the group of position labels corresponding to A=0 and that corresponding to A=1 were obtained. The former group was composed of SLAB, SLBA, SALB, SABL, SBLA, SBAL, LSAB, LSBA, LBSA, BLSA, BSAL, and BSLA, and the latter group was composed of the position labels LASB, LABS, ABLS, ALBS, LBAS, BALS, BLAS, ABSL, ASBL, ASLB, ALSB, and BASL. In Step 2, S&gt;A was obtained as the partial position labels of the former group, but is not observed in the position labels of the latter corresponds to A=1 because A&gt;S is commonly observed in all the position labels of the latter group, but not in the position labels of the former group at all. The parts of Table V for honorific elements B and E we re obtained in a similar way. 
The data in Table V suggests the following: (1) An honorific title does not follow A (A indicates a person's name; (A=0) when the (2) An honorific title does not follow B (B indicates a person's name); (B=0) when the (5) Both the respectful and the two-directional honorific expressions (P=1 or 3) can be 4. PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT We performed psychological experiments to compare knowledge of Japanese honorific expressions as provided by textbooks with knowledge demonstrated by people. 4.1 Procedure Forty subjects divided into four groups according to age (Y: younger, 18 to 22 years old, all university students; O: older, over 35 years old; and gender (M, male and F, female) participated in the experiments. Each group was made up of 10 subjects; we refer to the groups as YM, YF, OM, and OF, respectively. Table III, were also assumed in the e xperiments. For each combination of speech required to describe more than one sentence under the following conditions.  X  The sentences must satisfy the rest rictions stated in Section 3.1.  X  The sentences must be normative (i.e., th e sentences are strictly correct and follow  X  The listener, person A, and person B are assumed to be male; the speaker's gender  X  All the people involved are assumed to belong to the same social group. intentions  X  24 position label variations). 4.2 Ratios of Misuse of Word Forms As explained in Section 2.2, the misuse of honorific expressions can be divided into two main areas: misuse of word fo rms (category 1), and misuse in performance (category 2). 
To investigate the tendency of subjects to make mistakes in category 1 usage, we calculated the ratios of category 1 misuse for each subject group. This ratio was defined as the number of answers that include misuse s in word form, divided by the total number of answers from the subject group. groups, indicating that category 1 misuse was not a serious problem for the subjects in the experiments. Hence in the rest of this article we focus on category 2 mistakes. 4.3 Appearance Ratios of Honorific Patterns averaged over speech intentions. The most common and the next-most-common honorific patterns in the answers of the younger subject groups (i.e., YM and YF) and older subject groups (i.e., OM and OF) for each po sition label are shown in Table VI . In this table, the frequency ranking differs for male and female s ubjects. Values in parentheses attached to for male and female subjects. For each column of rows whose position labels are SLAB, SLBA, SALB, SABL, SBLA, SBAL, LSAB, LSBA, ASBL, and BSAL (where the most when the data for males and females is co mpounded in each age group. For example, the appearance ratio for the honorific pattern 0000 , corresponding to the position label SLAB averaged over the subjects in each age group, differed significantly for younger and older subjects. 
We made the following discoveries about the most frequently appearing honorific patterns in Table VI. (1) The use of honorific patterns are usually the same for male and female subjects in (2) The honorific patterns underlined in Table VI differ for the younger and older position labels LBAS, BALS, BLAS, and BASL , which show two alternative honorific patterns in Table III.Comparing Table III with Table VI, we also noticed the following. 
These results suggest that knowledge of no rmative honorific expr essions in textbooks is similar to that of the younger subjects, but differed from that of the older subjects. 4.4 The Summarized Consistency Table from Experiments To clarify how older subjects X  knowledge of normative honorific expressions differs from information in textbooks, we summarized the OM and OF column in Table VI into Table VII by a similar procedure to the one used to summarize Table III into Table V. All the honorific patterns corresponding to position labels LBAS, BALS, BLAS, and BASL honorific patterns are common to male and female subjects in the column OM and OF in the position label BASL in the OM group (1102) differs from that of the OF group (1111). However, in this case, we used 1102 as th e common honorific pattern between the male and female groups, since 1102 is the third most frequently appearing honorific pattern frequently appearing honorific pattern used by all the older subjects. Therefore, Table VII represents the knowle dge shared in common by the OM and OF subject groups. Table VII (containing the knowledge of most of the older subjects) differs from Table V (textbook knowledge) in the following ways. (1) An honorific title does not follow A ("A" indicates a person's name); A=0 when the (2) An honorific title does not follow B ("B" indicates a person's name); B=0 when the A comparison of Tables V and VII suggests the following. 
First, regarding the use of honorific titles --the older subjects were much more likely has not been fully discussed previously. and with textbooks and previous studies of Japanese honorific expressions). 
Third, with respect to honorific element P for the partial relative position B&gt;A&gt;S, the older subjects tended to use the subject honorific expression as the primary one, which is which is described as the interchangeable expression for subject honorifics in textbooks. This suggests that older subjects tend to think that using the object honorific expression is person B whose social position is higher than that of the speaker and person A. They may such expressions is more difficult than that of others [Kikuchi 1997]. 4.5 Hit Ratios for Summarized Consistency Tables separately for P. We used a separate defin ition for P because of the special characteristics of the honorific element P for the partial relative position B&gt;A&gt;S, as explained above. 
The hit ratio of each subj ect group for each summari zed consistency table for H = v , represents a value of the honorific element (i.e., 0 or 1), was calculated as where hit(PRP[ H = v ]) and all(PRP[ H = v ]) represent, respectively, the number of answers whose honorific element H has a value v and the total number of answers for consistency table, pooled over a ll subjects in the subject group. 
For example, we calculated the hit ratio[A=0 ] of the YM subject group for Table V as answers for the partial relative position S&gt;A, where each of the numbers was pooled over the subjects in the YM group. The total hit ratio for the honorifi c element H was also calculated as 
Total hit ratio[ H ]= calculated in two ways. 
The hit ratio[P=0], the hit ratio[P=1], and th e hit ratio[P=2] were calculated by Eq. (1)', position B&gt;A&gt;S are ignored and v =0, 1, 2 in both equations. calculated as 
Hit ratio[P=1 or w ] = hit(PRP[P=1 or w ]) / all (B&gt;A&gt;S), answers whose honorific element P has a value of either 1 or w , and the total number of group. The total hit ratio for the honori fic element P was calculated as 
Total hit ratio[P]=( where shows the summarized consistency table used for each calculation, which was common for honorific elements P (except the partia l relative position B&gt;A&gt;S) and E. The second column shows the values of each honorific element, where A (Total), B (Total), E (Total), and P (Subtotal) is the subtotal hit ratio for honorific element P. The third column shows fourth to seventh columns show the hit ratios for each subject group. The details of the hit 
The bottom two lines of Table VIII (where "Mean" is shown in the second column) respectively. 4.6 Detailed Discussions of Table VIII subjects in each subject group (Table IX). Table IX thus represents the general tendency of each subject group regardless of relative soci al position. 
The notable points of Table VIII follow: The hit ratios of A=0 and A=1 are almost the consistency table. This suggests that the strategy chosen by subjects regarding the usage of honorific titles for a person does not depend on whether the person is the subject or the object of the predicate. in both consistency tables (0.531 (YM) and 0.529 (YF) in Table V and 0.537 (YM) and the answers of the younger subjects. We can see that the component hit ratios P=1, P=2, group. These features suggest that the younger people had not acquired a specific strategy 
The mean hit ratios in Tables V and VII range from 0.763 to 0.915 and 0.850 to 0.916, details of the strategy employed by the OF su bject group for honorific elements A, B, and specialization would lead to a lack of universality. Therefore, it is meaningful that 76% to represented by a minimal model such as ours. 5. CONCLUSION We investigated the knowledge regarding normative honorific expressions provided by textbooks and that demonstrated by subjects during psychological experiments. The 40 subjects who participated in the experiments were divided into 4 groups according to age (younger/older) and gender (male/female). 
The experimental results reveal that knowledge regarding normative honorific younger subjects, but differed from that shown by older subjects. The knowledge displayed by older subjects was more complicated than that in textbooks or that shown by younger subjects. 
The model will be useful for developing computer-aided systems for teaching how honorific expressions should be used. The rules defined in both Table V (the summarized consistency table obtained from textbooks) and Table VII (the summarized consistency Table V and Table VII are (alternatively) recommended, depending upon the educational purpose. The rules defined in Table V may be suitable for learning basic or strict norms of honorific expressions, whereas those defined in Table VII may be suitable for learning higher-level expressions that are more useful in practical conversations. 
The model still needs to be improved so that it can deal with situations where people X  X  occur frequently in practical conversations. Additional psychological experiments will be required to achieve this REFERENCES
