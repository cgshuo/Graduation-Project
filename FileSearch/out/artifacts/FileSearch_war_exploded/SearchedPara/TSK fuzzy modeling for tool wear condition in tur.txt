 1. Introduction
Tool condition has a strong influence on the resulting surface finish and dimensional integrity of the workpiece, as well as vibration levels of the machine tool. The information obtained from tool wear monitoring can be used for several purposes that include establishing tool change policy, economic optimization of machining operations, compensating for tool wear on-line and to some extent avoiding catastrophic tool failures ( El Gomayel and Bregger, 1998 ). Effective monitoring of a manufacturing process is essential for ensuring product quality and reducing production costs. Analysis, implementation and evaluation of machining processes present significant challenges to the manu-facturing industry. The machining process varies considerably depending on the workpiece material, temperature, cutting fluids, chip formation, the tool material, chatter and vibration. The strain rate is extremely high compared to that of other fabrication processes as well ( Moriwaki, 1983 ). Because the information obtained during machining process is/could be incomplete, impre-very few established analytical models due to the difficulty in understanding the exact physics in most precision manufacturing processes. Researchers are required for quantitative evaluations of the transmission characteristics of cutting parameters and the calibration of the sensors ( Lee, 1991 ).

Fuzzy modeling, known as qualitative modeling based on fuzzy system behavior in such a qualitative way that the model is more effective and versatile in capturing the behavior of ill-defined systems with fuzziness or fully defined system with realistic approximation. Takagi X  X ugeno X  X ang (TSK) fuzzy modeling ( Takagi and Sugeno, 1985; Sugeno and Kang, 1988 ), was proposed in an effort to develop a systematic approach to generating fuzzy rules from a given input X  X utput data set. This model consists of rules with fuzzy antecedents and mathematical function in the consequent part. The antecedents divide the input space into a set of fuzzy regions, while consequents describe behavior of system in those regions. There are some works in modeling manufacturing process on using TSK-fuzzy model, for example, surface roughness prediction with genetic algorithm (GA) ( Nandi, 2006 ), drilling performances ( Nandi and Davim, 2009 ), processing times estima-tion based on genetic programming ( Mucientes et al., 2009 ), etc.
The aim of this paper is to present TSK fuzzy modeling based on generates fuzzy rules directly from the input X  X utput data acquired from sensors, and provides high accuracy and high reliability of the tool wear prediction over a wide range of cutting conditions.
This paper is divided into four sections. Section 1 introduces TSK fuzzy modeling and tool wear monitoring. Section 2 is the brief description of the subtractive clustering based TSK fuzzy modeling method. Section 3 describes experimental setup and data acquire-ment. Section 4 details the fuzzy model approach  X  cluster identi-fication and consequent parameters identification by using least-square estimation. Section 5 shows the effective experimental results from the TSK fuzzy approach and compares it with other different artificial intelligence methods  X  neural net-work (NN), Mamdani FL and a neural network based fuzzy system (NF). Section 6 contains concluding remarks and future research recommendations. 2. Subtractive clustering based TSK fuzzy modeling
The structure of a fuzzy TSK model can be done manually based on knowledge about the target process or using data-driven techniques. Identification of the system using clustering involves formation of clusters in the data space and translation of these clusters into TSK rules such that the model obtained is close to the system to be identified.

The aim of Chiu X  X  (1994) subtractive clustering identification algorithm is to estimate both the number and initial location of cluster centers and extract the TSK fuzzy rules from input/output data. Subtractive clustering operates by finding the optimal data point to define a cluster center based on the density of surrounding data points. This method is a fast clustering method designed for high dimension problems with a moderate number of data points.
This is because its computation grows linearly with the data dimension and as the square of the number of data points. A brief description of Chiu X  X  subtractive clustering method is as follows.
Consider a collection of q data points { x 1 , x 2 y , x n m -dimensional x j . Without loss of generality, assume the feature space is normalized, so that all data are bounded by a unit hypercube. Calculate potential for each point by using the following equation: p  X  where 99 99 denotes the Euclidean distance. It is noteworthy that onlythefuzzyneighborhoodwithintheradius r a istothemeasureof potential.

After the potential of every data point has been computed, the its potential value, then revise the potential of each data point x the formula p where b  X  4 = r 2 b and r b  X  Z r a .

When the potential of all data points have been reduce by (2), the data point with the highest remaining potential is selected as the second cluster center. Then further reduce the potential of each data points. Generally, after k th cluster center has been obtained, the potential of each data point is revised by formula p where x 1 is the location of the k th cluster center and p potential value.

The process of acquiring new cluster center and revising potential repeats by using the following criteria: accept x k as a cluster center and continue. let d min  X  shortest of the distances between x k and all previously found cluster centers. as space whose neighborhood maps into the given class. Each cluster IF-THEN rules which represent input X  X utput relations of a system.
For a multi-input single-output (MISO) first-order type-1 TSK model, its k th rule can be expressed as

In such system, real-time data are first acquired from sensors (e.g. dynamometers on Fig. 2 ) located as different locations of the workpiece, tool and machine-tool, then signal processing techni-que (amplifiers) are used to extract valid data, and decision making system (computers) is used to analyze the data and classify the results in order to make a more reliable estimation of the state of the tool and consequently of the machined parts themselves ( Balazinski et al., 1994 ). Fig. 2 shows the experimental setup. 3.2. Data acquirement
Cutting force measurement, currently the most reliable and accurate sensing method available in metal cutting, is one of the most commonly employed methods for on-line tool wear mon-itoring. Itis frequentlyappliedinturning processes because cutting force values are more sensitive to tool wear than other measure-ments such as vibration or acoustic emission ( Du et al., 1995 ).
The experiments described in this paper were conducted on a conventional lathe TUD-50. A CSRPR 2525 tool holder equipped with a TiN X  X l 2 O 3  X  X iCN coated sintered carbide insert SNUN 120408 was used in the test. To simulate factory floor conditions, six sets of cutting parameters were selected and applied in sequence as presented in Fig. 3 . During machining, the feed force manually measured after each test for a given feed rate ( f ). following two observations: F f is independent of f , but rather depends on VB and the depth of cut, denoted a p . Moreover, F depends on a p and f , while being only weakly dependent on VB. So, in this paper f and the measurement F c are used to determine a and the measurement F f is used to determine VB without requiring a p as an input variable.
 measured after carrying out each sequence. The value for F were measured by a single cut using a Kistler 9263 dynamometer
Recent research has attempted to investigate the application of multiple sensors with complementing characteristics to provide a experiments had a soft, cobalt-enriched layer of the substrate under the coating, their tool life had a tendency to end suddenly after this coating wore through.

Two experiments were carried out until a tool failure occurred. In the first tests (designated W5) 10 cycles were performed until a sudden rise of the flank wear VB occurred, reaching approximately 0.5 mm. In the second test (designated W7) failure of the coating resulted in chipping of the cutting edge at the end of 9th cycle. W5 was devised for TSK fuzzy rule identification, while W7 was used to verify the performance of the different monitoring system. Fig. 4 presents the cutting force components F f and F c versus VB obtained in the experiments. Apparently, F c is weakly dependent of on VB. It is a function of the cutting parameters only. On the other hand, F independent of f , being affected only by VB. This provides an interestingopportunitytoestimatethetoolwearwithoutrequiring information about a p . 4. TSK fuzzy modeling
For this experimental, TSK fuzzy modeling, in which subtractive clustering method is combined with a least-square estimation algorithm, was used to accomplish the integration of multi-sensor information and tool wear information. Detailed description for this method can be found in ( Ren et al., 2008 ). The diagram of the algorithm is shown in Fig. 5 .

By using TSK fuzzy approach, a nine rule TSK fuzzy model can be obtained to describe VB with f , F f and F c as input variables. 4.1. Cluster centers

Table 1 lists the nine cluster centers obtained by subtractive clustering method from the first experiment W5. 4.2. Fuzzy rules
In this paper, the consequent functions are linear. Least-square estimation [8] is used to identify the consequent parameters of the TSK model, where the premise structure, premise parameters, consequent structure and consequent parameters were identified and adjusted recursively. Table 2 is the obtained fuzzy model for tool wear condition in this experiment. 5. Experimental results
Fig. 6 summarizes results of tool wear conditioning from W5 (learning) and W7 (testing) and compares them with several different artificial intelligence methods  X  NN, Mamdani FL and NF. Detailed parameters setting of these methods were described in Balazinski et al. (2002) , which were applied to the same experimental arrangements. Fig. 6 shows that the results from the proposed method fit the experimental data better than other AI methods.

The quality of the tool wear estimation is evaluated by root-mean-square-error(rmse)(Eq.(8))andmaximumerror (Eq.(9))for each AI methods. rmse  X  max  X  max  X  VB m VB e  X  X  9  X  where VB m and VB e are measured and estimated flank wear, respectively, and N is the number of patterns in the set ( N  X  71 for the experiment W5 and N  X  66 for the experiment W7).
In Table 3 , the TSK fuzzy approach has the lowest root-mean-square-error and the smallest maximum error.

The TSK fuzzy modeling program used for tool condition monitoring in this paper was developed by Geno-flou development group in Lab CAE at E  X  cole Polytechnique de Montre  X  al. 6. Conclusion
A TSK fuzzy approach using subtractive clustering is described in detail in this article. The experimental results show its effec-tiveness and a satisfactory comparison with several other artificial intelligence methods. But for tool condition monitoring, none of existing methods can overcome the defect that the models are difficult to estimate the errors of approximation.
