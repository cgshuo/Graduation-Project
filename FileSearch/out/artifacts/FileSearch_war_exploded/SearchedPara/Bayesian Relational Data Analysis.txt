 Recently there have been many collections of relatio nal data in diverse areas such as the internet, social networks, customer shopping records, bioinf ormatics, etc. The main goal of the relational data analysis is to discover latent structure from the data. The conventional data mining algorithms based on exhaustive enumeration have an inherent limitation for this purpose because of the combinatorial nature of the methods. In contrast, in machine learning a lot of statistical models approach, especially Bayesian approach, for the re lational data analysis with recent advancements in machine learning literature. Then, as a future research I will also talk about a statistical approach for combining multiple relational data. MANAGEMENT: H.2.8 Database appl ications: Subjects: Data mining Naonori Ueda received the B.S., M.S., and Ph D degrees in Communication Engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 1982, 1984, a nd 1992, respectively. In 1984, he joined the Electrical Communication Laborato ries, NTT, Japan, where he wa s engaged in research on image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision. In 1991, he joined the NTT Communication Science Laboratories, where he has invented a significant learning principle for optimal vector quantizer design and has developed some novel learning algorith ms including deterministic annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm, ensemble learning, the split a nd merge EM (SMEM) algorithm, semi-supervised learning, variati onal Bayesian model search algor ithm for mixture models and its application to speech recognition, and probabilistic generative models for multi-labeled text in WWW. His current research interests include parametric and non-parametric Bayesian approach to machine learning, pattern recogniti on, data mining, signal processing, and cyber-physical systems. From 1993 to 1994, he was a visi ting scholar at Purdue Univer sity, West Lafa yette, USA. Currently, he is a director of NTT Communication Science Laboratories. He is an associate editor of Neurocomputing and Journal of Neural Networks, and is a member of the Institute of Electronics, Information, and Communi cation Engineers (IEICE), and IEEE.
