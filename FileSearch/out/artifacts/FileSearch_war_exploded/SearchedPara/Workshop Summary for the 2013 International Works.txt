 I.2.7 [ Natural Language Processing ]: Text Analysis, Language Models. Big data, natural language proce ssing, text mining, information retrieval Unstructured text data is heterogeneous in nature and available in different formats and styles, such as text document, scientific publication, web page, and customer comment. The availability of many big unstructured text datasets enables, while also challenges researchers to discover and explore valuable information /knowledge via different techniques. Mining semantics by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies is an important a pproach to uncover the  X  X atent knowledge/semantic X  of the unstruct ured text data. In the past decade, while a number of NLP based features have been already successfully used to enhance the performance of the text mining or information retrieval systems, we are also facing some challenges. For instance, most NLP algorithms X  computational cost is high, and we can hardly employ them directly to large-scale text data for online systems. Meanwhile, some novel textual data , e.g., Twitter and customer review, may not have rich context, and it is hard to implement classical grammar based NLP algorithms to extract semantic information. In this workshop, we aggregate different but highly related research communities, i.e.,  X  X LP X ,  X  X ext Mining X  and  X  X R X  (information retrieval) researchers, to investigate the possible opportunities and challenges in semantic mining problem. Big unstructured text data retrieval and mining research so far has been mainly based on the simple explicit features , i.e., bag-of-words (BOW) representation of text data, which has proven effective for many tasks despite its simplicity. However, the explicit feature representation cl early has the obvious limitation of being unable to capture semantics of information, and thus sets a bottleneck of the algorithm performance. From users X  point of view, the BOW representation can only support keyword queries, which of ten cannot precisely express a user X  X  information needs, making it fairly hard to further improve the retrieval accuracy of the current-generation search engines, especially in the case of long-tail difficult queries. NLP is an important approach to enhance the BOW text representation. Based on Liddy (1998), NLP is a range of computational techniques for analyzing and representing naturally morphological, lexical, syntact ic, semantic, discourse, and pragmatic level analysis. Embracing NLP technologies in IR and text mining can thus be expect ed to significantly expand the horizon of research and pave the way for great success of IR and text mining research in the big data era. However, comparing with BOW based text representation, extracting NLP based features from text is usually more expens ive, and we can hardly employ them directly to large-scale text data for online systems. As another challenge, some classical NLP resources, such as WordNet, may not be appropriate given their limited coverage, whereas some other novel semantic resources, such as DBpedia and linked open data are more broad while with less human validation. We also find some recent studies in large-scale Twitter, and customer review data cannot us e classical NLP algorithms given the very short length of documents and the very limited context information. It is critical to address and solve these problems from perspectives of IR and text mining. For this workshop, an opportunity is provided to both NLP and text mining research communities to better clarify the opportunities and challenges in NL P based semantic mining for big unstructured text data with their research experience, which can foster the much needed collaborations between the communities and open up exciting new research directions relevant to different communities. In this workshop, we have 9 accepted papers, which covers a number of different topics in te xt mining and natural language processing. Authors perform text from differe nt sources, including social media text [Hong, Fei, Yang], [Zoghbi, Vuli  X  , Moens] and [Baucom, Sanjari, Liu, Chen], citation network graph [Jung, Segev], customer review [Wang, Min, Huang, Li, Wu] and [Chen, Liu, Liu, Yu], digitized cultural text [Borin, Dubhashi, Forsberg, Johansson, Kokkinakis, Nugues], fl ora text [Wei], and television news programs [Castillo, De Francisci Morales, Mendoza, Khan]. We also found the papers tend to be focusing on the following research topics. 1) Network information is inform ative and important addition to network nodes and links, [Wang, Min, Huang, Li, Wu] make use of social ties for review rating in combination with text. 2) Words are important features fo r quite some classification tasks in addition to typical text categorization, such as location closeness classification in [Baucom, Sanjari, Liu, Chen] and business recommendation in [Zoghbi, Vuli  X  , Moens]. 3) Twitter as a real-time social media website has been exploited to reflect real-world trends. Tw o studies, [Hong, Fei, Yang] and [Baucom, Sanjari, Liu, Chen], are of this kind. [Baucom, Sanjari, Liu, Chen] studied the distance between Twitter and real-world dynamic NBA data. The finding, somehow, differs from some classical studies in this field.
