 1. Introduction
Search engines are becoming a major tool to access information over the Web for many people. It is impor-tant, for this reason, to study the behavior of search engine users. One dimension of search engine user profile is content-based behavior. Currently, search engines are not designed to differentiate according to the user  X  s profile and the content that the user is interested in, and personalization and context of search engine use have been recognized as major research challenges in a number of workshops ( Liu, Croft, Oh, &amp; Hart, 2004 ).
However, exploiting the user  X  s interest in various topics has the potential to improve Web retrieval systems interests could be a significant step towards the development of intelligent search engines.

One of the main elements in developing an intelligent search engine is new topic identification. New topic identification is discovering when the user has switched from one topic to another during a single search session. If the search engine is aware that the user  X  s new query is on the same topic as the previous query, the search engine could provide the results from the document cluster relevant to the previous query, or alterna-tively, if the user is on a new topic, the search engine could resort to searching other document clusters.
Consequently, search engines can decrease the time and effort required to process the query. In addition, custom-tailored graphical user interfaces can be offered to the Web search engine user, if topic changes were estimated correctly by the search engine. Ozmutlu, Ozmutlu, and Spink (2003a) mention that users interested in different topics could benefit more from such IR systems designed according to their searching needs. Some features of custom-tailored IR systems, which are more sensitive to users  X  various information needs are mapped out by Ozmutlu et al. (2003a) . Had topic identification been successfully performed, sophisticated graphical user interfaces could be offered by search engines that can help users (a) enable the reformulation of multiple queries on different or related topics, and facilitate task switching, i.e. allowing the tracking, stor-ing and manipulating of retrieved results and printouts related to different topics over multiple searches, (b) provide the ability to create multiple sets of working notes related to different or related search topics, i.e., sketching and note creation tools, (c) enable Web users to submit and track multiple queries concurrently on different or related topics, (d) allow for searching multiple search engines or collections concurrently on multiple topics, (e) review search histories from various searches and topics, and provide the ability to create clusters of retrieved information related to different or related topics.

There are few studies on query clustering and new topic identification, presented in more detail in the related research section. The studies generally analyzed the queries semantically. Semantic analysis of queries is a promising line of research, but is a complicated task, hence its current success is ambiguous. In our pre-vious studies, we applied content-ignorant methodologies for automatic new topic identification, such as
Dempster X  X hafer Theory and genetic algorithms ( Ozmutlu &amp; Cavdur, 2005a; Ozmutlu, Cavdur, &amp; Ozmutlu, submitted for publication ) and neural networks ( Ozmutlu &amp; Cavdur, 2005b; Ozmutlu, Cavdur, Ozmutlu, &amp;
Spink, 2004a ). These methodologies rely on the statistical characteristics of the queries, such as the time between query submissions and the reformulation of the subsequent queries, instead of the meaning of the queries. The initial indications of the relation between statistical characteristics of queries and topic change were shown in Spink, Ozmutlu, and Ozmutlu (2002b), Goker and He (2000) and He and Goker (2000) . How-ever, none of these studies demonstrate the statistical significance of the relationship between the non-semantic characteristics of queries and the timing of topic shifts and continuations.

In this study, we aim to estimate topic shifts in search engine query logs using multiple linear regression and demonstrate the statistical significance of the relationship between non-semantic characteristics of query logs and topic shifts/continuations. Using the characteristics of the search queries as independent factors and the existence of topic shifts as the dependent factor, multiple linear regression is applied to investigate the relation-ship between statistical characteristics and topic shifts. We also apply ANOVA to examine the structure of the be helpful in identifying whether there is a relationship between statistical characteristics of the search queries and topic shifts/continuations. If such a relationship exists, content-ignorant methodologies can be expected to be successful.

We initially present the literature review related to topic identification, followed by the description of the methodology, results and the conclusion. 2. Related research Many researchers worked on large scaled studies on search engine datalogs, such as Silverstein, Henzinger, Marais, and Moricz (1999), Cooley, Mobasher, and Srivastava (1999), Spink, Bateman, and
Jansen (1999, 2001, 2002a), Ozmutlu, Ozmutlu, and Spink (2002b, 2003b, 2003c) and Ozmultu and Spink (2002) . Most of the studies are based on statistical or linguistic characteristics of the search queries ( Pu,
Chuang, Shui-Lung, &amp; Yang, 2002 ). The number of studies on content analysis is few, the reason generally being the effort required to manually process the queries for topic identification; however, content analysis is a growing area ( Pu et al., 2002 ). In this section, we classify the research on content-based studies to a few subsections, listed as topic analysis, multitasking, query clustering models, text classification and categori-zation models.
 2.1. Topic analysis
Some researchers, such as Silverstein et al. (1999), Jansen, Spink, and Saracevic (2000) and Spink et al. (2001) , have performed content analysis of search engine data logs at the term level, hence analyzed the fre-quency of terms and term pairs in search engine queries. All these researchers have observed that the highest ranking terms are related to topics of pornography, entertainment and education. In another study, Spink et al. (2002a) have analyzed Excite datasets from 1997, 1999 and 2001 for content and found that human infor-mation needs and search content have evolved from 1997 to 2001; for example users  X  interests have shifted from entertainment and pornography to travel and commerce. Ozmutlu, Ozmutlu, and Spink (2004b) have done an hourly statistical and topical analysis of an Excite query log and a Fast query log of about 1 million queries each. They have found that the popularity of topics vary throughout the day. For example, topics such as finance, business and education are more popular during the earlier hours of the day, whereas entertain-ment and pornography are more prevalent during the evening. Ozmutlu et al. (2004b) and Beitzel, Jensen,
Chowdhury, Grossman, and Frieder (2004) have also shown that the popularity of some topical categories depend on the hour of the day. Wang, Berry, and Yang (2003) analyzed a query log from the website of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and have observed that the vocabulary of Web users is comparatively small, and term and term pairs have similar trends of frequency. However, Wang et al. (2003) mention that such studies are at the lexical level and they intend to carry their studies to a conceptual level by using lexical databases. 2.2. Multitasking
Another dimension of topic-related information retrieval is multitasking. During a search session, some users can be interested in multiple topics. Multitasking is performing more than one task simultaneously.
In terms of information retrieval, multitasking information seeking and searching processes or defined as  X  X  X he process of searches over time in relation to more than one, possibly evolving, set of information problems (2001) and Spink et al. (2002b) show that users  X  searches have multiple goals or topics. Spink et al. (1999) found that 3.8% of Excite users responding to a Web-based survey reported multitasking searches. In other studies, it was observed that in a datalog of the Excite search engine collected for a day in 1999, 11.4% of users performed multitasking searches and in a datalog of the FAST search engine collected for a day in 2001, 31.8% of users performed multitasking searches ( Ozmutlu et al., 2003a ). 2.3. Query clustering models
Besides studies analyzing search engine queries for content information, another research area of informa-tion retrieval is developing query clustering models based on content information. Beeferman and Berger (2000) and Wen et al. (2002) applied query clustering that uses search engine query logs including clickthrough data, which provides the documents that the user have selected as a result of the search query. Query similar-ities are proposed based on the common documents that users have selected. The difference of Beeferman and
Berger  X  s (2000) study is that it is content-ignorant. Pu et al. (2002) developed an automatic classification meth-odology to classify search queries into broad subject categories. They formed a subject taxonomy and fit each search query into one of the categories in the taxonomy. Wen, Nie, and Zhang (2002) claimed that query clus-tering based on cross-referencing of queries and documents is more successful than basic keyword-based clus-tering. Zhu, Greiner, and Haubl (2003) proposed a link based system that generates queries from terms contained in the previously accessed documents. Their algorithm assumed that the last accessed document is the only relevant document and was based on predicting whether a term is likely to occur in the last accessed relevant document. Muresan and Harper (2004) proposed a topic modeling system for developing mediated queries. They performed a statistical analysis of terms in documents available in a source collection and a sta-tistical representation of the lexicographic model of the query. This step is followed by context analysis, which relates topics and terms considering weights, and then developing mediated queries based on the similarity of the terms to specific topics. Recently, Liu et al. (2004) used Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify queries in different groups.
Some syntactic features of the queries, such as sentence length, average number of characters per word, aver-age number of syllables per word, percentage of various part-of-speech tags, and various readability indices, were used to classify the queries, as well as semantic features, such as frequency of numerous 1-, 2-, and 3-word sequences. Results showed that SVM achieved a recognition accuracy around 80% for queries. Metzler and Croft (2005a) also performed classification of question queries using SVM and prior knowledge on the correlation values between question words and types. 2.4. Text classification and categorization models There also exist many studies in the more general context of text classification, categorization and mining.
Filtering the documents as relevant and not relevant is seen as a binary classification problem. Within the con-text of the binary classification problem, SVM has been extensively used ( Chai, Ng, &amp; Chieu, 2002; Joachims, 1998; Sebastiani, 2002; Tax &amp; Duin, 2001; Yang &amp; Liu, 1999 ) and has been successful for text categorization ( Yu, Zhai, &amp; Ha, 2003 ). Recently, Yu et al. (2003) classify unlabeled text into categories using SVMC (support vector mapping convergence), an efficient extension of SVM. They found that when the number of positive documents in the document space is insufficient, SVMC outperforms other methods, whereas it provides poorer results when the number of positive documents increases in the sample space.
 Other significant work on text mining is as follows: Swan and Jensen (2000) proposed a system called Time-
Mines that uses the date tags on the documents and the statistical characteristics of term usage to successfully group documents in separate clusters. Lawrie, Croft, and Rosenberg (2001) compared different hierarchy models to categorize documents, and found that the dominating set technique performed better compared to other techniques in terms of finding topic words for hierarchical categorization of documents. Shakery and Zhai (2003) test how the language modeling approaches of basic query likelihood method with Dirichlet prior smoothing, and two-stage smoothing with mixture model feedback perform for topic distillation. They found that the two-stage smoothing with feedback outperforms the query likelihood method. They also pro-posed a general relevance propagation model for combining link and content information, an discovered that combining link and content information generally performs better than using only content information. Jin,
Sin, and Zhai (2003) perform user-centric information retrieval through by making use of relevance feedback information. Hu, Bandhakavi, and Zhai (2003) studied the precision and average rank of hard TREC-topics.
Zhai, Coehn, and Lafferty (2003) investigated the sub-topic retrieval problem, which is retrieving document that contains information on the subtopics of a main topic included in the user query. Sayyadian, Shakery,
Doan, and Zhai (2004) attempt to solve the problem of entity retrieval, which is retrieving extra information about an entity such as a person, or place from text and structured data, given some level of information about that certain entity. Zhai, Velivelli, and Yu (2004) study the comparative text mining problem, which is search-ing for common themes in various collections of text. They proposed a generative probabilistic mixture model for comparative text mining. Kelly, Diaz, Belkin, and Allan (2004) investigated the techniques used for topic clustering of documents and discovered that most methods performed poorly when evaluated according to the user-defined topic classes. Mei and Zhai (2005) used statistical language models to perform a special temporal text mining task, which is studying the patterns of themes in text. They showed that the statistical methods used in the study, the Kullback X  X eibler divergence and a hidden Markov chain model, can successfully pro-vide temporal theme structures. Wang, Mohanty, and McCallum (2005) showed that the Group-Topic model can be successfully used to search for clusters of topics of events within collections of documents. Li and
McCallum (2005) successfully used a semi-supervised learning method to generate syntactic and semantic word clusters. Shen, Tan, and Zhai (2005) studied how to utilize feedback information to improve retrieval performance. They used four language models for context-sensitive retrieval, and showed that feedback infor-mation can improve retrieval performance. Metzler and Croft (2005a, 2005b) used a Markov random field model to analyze term dependencies in text. They showed that modeling the term dependencies significantly increased the performance of information retrieval.

Another application of text mining is Topic Detection and Discovery (TDT), which is to process news streams and gather information in different news topics. TDT consists of five tasks, topic tracking, link detec-tion, topic detection, first story detection and story segmentation ( Feng &amp; Allan, 2005 ). Topic modeling has been performed significantly in the context of Topic Detection and Tracking ( Kelly et al., 2004 ). The signif-icant works on TDT can be listed as those of Allan (2003), Feng and Allan (2005), Larkey, Feng, Connell, and Lavrenko (2004) and Kumaran and Allan (2004, 2005) .

Most query and document clustering methods, as described above, are focused on interpretation of key-words or understanding the topic or the contents of the query. This significantly complicates the process of query clustering and increases the potential noise of the results. One promising approach is to use content-ignorant methodologies to the problem of query clustering or new topic identification in a user search session ( Ozmutlu &amp; Cavdur, 2005a, 2005b ). In such an approach, queries can be categorized in different topic groups with respect to their statistical characteristics, such as the time intervals between subsequent queries or the reformulation of queries. There are few studies adapting such an approach. He, Goker, and Harper (2002) proposed a topic identification algorithm that uses Dempster X  X hafer Theory ( Shafer, 1976 ). Their algorithm automatically identifies topic changes using statistical data from Web search logs. Dempster X  X hafer Theory enables the combination of two separate probabilistic events related to a single property (such as the topic change). Dempster X  X hafer Theory requires the probabilities of each event, the weights (importance) of these separate probabilistic events and a threshold value used to identify a topic shift. He et al. (2002) used the search pattern and duration of a query as the probabilistic events for Dempster X  X hafer Theory. Probabilities are easily obtained through the analysis of the data log. To set the required weights and the threshold, they applied a genetic algorithm. The performance of the topic identification algorithm is determined by measures of precision and recall, and their combination, the fitness function.

He et al.  X  s (2002) approach was replicated on Excite search engine data ( Ozmutlu &amp; Cavdur, 2005a ). The main finding of Ozmutlu and Cavdur (2005a) was that the idea of using query patterns and time intervals in identifying topic shifts is valuable, but there are indications of some problems in the application of this idea.
The problem could be in applying Dempster X  X hafer Theory for topic identification, applying genetic algo-rithms to provide the values of the system parameters or making an incorrect choice of fitness function.
In our previous studies ( Ozmutlu &amp; Cavdur, 2005b; Ozmutlu et al., 2004a ), we applied an alternative con-tent-ignorant methodology, namely artificial neural networks, to automatically identify topic changes. Appli-cation of neural networks for automatic new topic identification does not contain semantic analysis, and relies on the statistical characteristics of the queries, such as the time between query submissions and the reformu-lation of the subsequent queries. The statistical characteristics of the query log were the inputs of the neural network, and the binary response of topic shift/continuation was the output of the neural network. In these studies, we showed that neural networks also identified topic shifts successfully.

In this study, we aim to estimate topic shifts in search engine query logs using another statistical learning approach, multiple linear regression, and also apply ANOVA to examine the structure of the variance of the topic shifts with respect to the statistical characteristics of the search queries. Section 3 describes in detail how these methods are applied on the new topic identification problem. 3. Methodology 3.1. Research question
The research question in this study is to observe whether there is statistical relationship between topic shifts within consecutive queries and characteristics of search engine user queries. In addition, we aim to provide successful estimation of topic shifts in consecutive queries within a user session. In order to perform these tasks, we apply multiple linear regression ( Montgomery, 1991 ) on a search engine query log. We also apply
ANOVA to examine the structure of the variance of the topic shifts with respect to the statistical character-istics of the search queries. 3.2. The dataset
The search query log used in this study comes from the Excite search engine ( http://www.excite.com ) located in the USA. The data was collected on December 20, 1999 and consists of 1,025,910 search queries.
In the Excite data log structures, the entries are given in the order they arrive. It is possible to identify new sessions through a user ID and each query contains three fields: (1) Identification: anonymous code assigned by the search engine server to a user; (2) Time of day: in hours, minutes, and seconds; (3) Query: user terms as entered. We selected a sample of 10,003 queries from 963 users from a total of 1,257,891 queries. A session is defined as all the queries submitted by a single user, since IP change may not indicate that the sequence of the queries has ended.

Approximately the first 10,000 queries of the dataset were selected as a sample from the Excite dataset. The sample size was not kept very large, since evaluation of the performance of the algorithm would require a human expert to go over all the queries. The sample was selected using Poisson sampling ( Ozmutlu, Spink, &amp; Ozmutlu, 2002a ) to provide a sample dataset that is both statistically representative of the entire data set and small enough to be analyzed conveniently. Poisson sampling provides a basis for sampling from large-scale data logs, such as the Excite search query log, while preserving the characteristics of the main dataset ( Ozmutlu et al., 2002a ). Poisson sampling algorithms, widely applied in stochastic research, select sample points from a certain dataset by skipping a random number of observations that is distributed according to a Poisson process versus systematic sampling algorithms skipping a constant number of observations.
The Poisson sampling process is a useful random sampling process which includes properties such as unbiased sampling, proportional sampling, comparability of heterogeneous Poisson sampling arrivals and flexibility on the stochastic arrival process from which the sample is selected. Due to the PASTA (Poisson Arrival See Time
Averages) property, a well established property of stochastic science, Poisson sampling can be applied to any kind of stochastic arrival process ( Wollf, 1982 ). This is the most important property for the applicability of
Poisson sampling on the Web search query data logs, since there is no information on the type of stochastic arrival process of the Web query sessions ( Ozmutlu et al., 2002a ). 3.3. Notation The following notation is used in this study:
N shift number of queries labeled as shifts by multiple linear regression
N contin number of queries labeled as continuation by multiple linear regression
N true shift number of queries labeled as shifts by manual examination of human expert
N true contin number of queries labeled as continuation by manual examination of human expert
N shift &amp; correct number of queries labeled as shifts by multiple linear regression and by manual
N contin &amp; correct number of queries labeled as continuation by multiple linear regression and by
Type A error this type of error occurs in situations where queries on same topics are
Type B error this type of error occurs in situations where queries on different topics are grouped Some useful formulation related to the above notation is as follows:
The performance measures of Precision ( P ), Recall ( R ) and their combination, a fitness function ( F used in this study to demonstrate the performance of multiple linear regression. The focus of precision and recall are both on correctly estimating the number of topic shifts and continuations. Interpreted in terms of topic shifts, as in Ozmutlu and Cavdur (2005a) and He et al. (2002) , precision ( P number of shifts by multiple linear regression among all the shifts marked by multiple linear regression (Eq. marked by the human expert (Eq. (6) ). On the other hand, interpreted in terms of topic continuations, preci-sion ( P contin ) is the correctly estimated number of continuations by multiple linear regression among all the continuations marked by multiple linear regression (Eq. (7) ) and recall ( R ber of continuations by multiple linear regression among all the continuations marked by the human expert (Eq. (8) ). The fifth measure, fitness function F b (Eq. (9) ), combines P is a parameter to prioritize different types of resulting errors of estimating topic changes. The reason for choosing an F b combining P shift and R shift is to provide a single parameter to compare different results and to be consistent with previous studies ( He et al., 2002 ). These performance measures are used to demonstrate the performance of multiple linear regression for estimating topic shifts and continuations. The formulation of these measures are as follows: 3.4. Statistical analysis
The research question in this study is to observe whether there is statistical relationship between character-istics of search engine user queries and topic shifts. In order to perform this task, we apply multiple linear regression on the dataset. Multiple linear regression is a model, where more than one regressor variable is involved to explain and estimate a dependent variable ( Montgomery, 1991 ).

The dependent factor for the multiple regression model in our study is existence of topic shift/topic contin-uation. Topic continuations are marked as  X  X 1 X  X  and topic shifts are marked as  X  X 2 X  X . The independent factors are search pattern of queries (SP), time interval of queries (TI) and the order of the search query (QN) in the user session (QN = k means that the query under consideration is the k th query of the session). We also con-sidered that the interaction of these main factors could be effective on topic shifts and continuations. Two fac-tor interactions are usually considered to be effective on dependent factors. The interactions considered in this study are the SP X  X I interaction, SP X  X N interaction and TI X  X N interaction. Considering these terms, a multi-ple regression equation proposed in this study to define the relationship between topic shifts/continuations and characteristics of the search queries. The coefficients of the regression model are identified. The hypothesized model is of the form Y = X b + e , where Y represents a set of observations of the dependent variable, X is the matrix representing the independent variables and e iid N (0, r this study, Y is the topic shift/continuation. The specific model for this study is as shown in Eq. (10) : where F i = factor i , i =1,2,3, F j = factor j , j = i +1, ... ,3, n = i + j + 1 and e iid N ( l , r
This model has a total of seven terms. The coefficient of this linear regression model of considerable size can be determined with the data form the Excite query log. The levels of the main factors will be given in the next section.
Testing the overall significance of the regression model requires hypothesis testing. The hypothesis testing for the significance of the overall model is as follows( Montgomery, 1991 ):
This hypothesis test examines whether all the regression coefficients are zero or not. If all the regression coefficients are zero than the regression equation does not have an effect on the dependent variable. The hypothesis test is performed using the F -test.

In addition to multiple linear regression, we apply of multiple factor ANOVA ( Montgomery, 1991 ), where we can investigate the structure of the variance of topic shifts with respect to the characteristics of the search queries, and to test the significance of each regressor on the dependent variable. Since the search queries are not designed with respect to a certain experimental design and acquired from the actual query log, sequential sum of squares are used to test for the significance of each factor in the model. The procedure to test the sig-nificance of each term in the model is one, where  X  X  X he contribution of the regression sum of squares for a parameter can be determined given that other parameters are already in the model X  X  ( Montgomery, 1991 ). The hypothesis testing for testing the significance of each independent factor is as follows:
This hypothesis test tests whether each regression coefficient is zero or not. The hypothesis test is performed using the F -test. If the null hypothesis cannot be rejected for a coefficient, this means that that certain factor does not have a significant effect on the dependent parameter, i.e. does not effect whether the query is a topic shift or continuation. 3.5. Methodology
In this section, we present the methodology applied in the paper to investigate the relationship between topic shifts and search query characteristics. 3.5.1. Evaluation by human expert
A human expert goes through the 10,003 query set for Excite and marks the actual topic changes and topic continuations. This step is necessary to form the dependent factor for the multiple linear regression equation and also for testing the performance of the regression equation. 3.5.2. Dividing the data into two sets
Approximately, first half of the data is used to form a regression equation and the second half is used to test the performance of the proposed multiple linear regression equation. The two data sections do not contain the same number of queries to keep the entirety of the user session containing the query in the middle of the data-sets. The first half of the Excite dataset contains 5014 queries, and the second half of the Excite dataset con-tains 4989 queries. The structure of the two sections of the dataset and the number of topic shifts and continuations in the entire dataset are in Table 1 . 3.5.3. Identifying search pattern, time interval and order of each query in the dataset
Each query in the dataset is categorized in terms of its search pattern, time interval, and its order in the user session. The time interval is the difference of the arrival times of two consecutive queries. The search pattern is the change of terms of the consecutive queries within a session. The order of the query in the session is the position of a query in the user session. The categorization of time interval and search pattern is selected similar to those of He et al. (2002), Ozmutlu et al. (2004a), Ozmutlu and Cavdur (2005a) and Ozmutlu and Cavdur (2005b) to be in harmony with previous studies.

We use seven categories of time intervals for a query: 0 X 5 minutes, 5 X 10 minutes, 10 X 15 minutes, 15 X 20 minutes, 20 X 25 minutes, 25 X 30 minutes, 30+ minutes. The levels of the time interval factor used in multiple linear regression are 1 through 7. See Table 2 for distribution of the queries with respect to time interval in the Excite datasets. It should be noted that not all of 5014 queries in Excite can be used for training, since the last query of each user session cannot be processed for pattern classification and time duration, since there are no subsequent queries after the last query of each session. In the training dataset for Excite, there were 1201 user sessions, so excluding the last query of each session, the test dataset is reduced to 3813 queries from 5014 queries. For the Excite dataset, after the human expert identified the topic shifts and continuations, 3544 topic continuations and 269 topic shifts were identified within the 3813 queries.

We also use seven categories of search patterns in this study, which are as follows ( Ozmutlu &amp; Cavdur, 2005a, 2005b; Ozmutlu et al., 2004a ): Unique (New): the second query has no common term compared to the first query.
 Next Page (Browsing): the second query requests another set of results on the first query.

Generalization: all of the terms of second query are also included in the first query but the first query has some additional terms.

Specialization: all of the terms of the first query are also included in the second query but the second query has some additional terms.

Reformulation: some of the terms of the second query are also included in the first query but the first query has some other terms that are not included in the second query. This means that the user has added and deleted some terms of the first query. Also if the user enters the same terms of the first query in different order, it is also considered as reformulation.

Relevance feedback: the second query is empty (i.e., contains no terms) and it is generated by the system when the user selects the choice of  X  X  X elated pages X  X .

Other: If the second query does not fit any of the above categories, it is labeled as other. Any non-empty query listed after an initial empty query, such as relevance feedback belongs to the  X  other  X  category. Note that if this pattern observed on an intermediate query in a session, this property does not hold.
The search patterns are automatically identified by a computer program. The pattern identification algo-rithm is adapted from He et al. (2002) , but is considerably altered. The logic for the automatic search pattern identification can be summarized as in Fig. 1 . Also see Table 3 for distribution of queries with respect to search patterns in the training dataset. The levels of the search pattern factor used in multiple linear regression are 1 through 7.

The order of a query in the session is the position of that query in that user session, which is assigned with respect to the query  X  s arrival time. The queries are categorized up to query 113 in the user sessions, since the highest number of queries within a session is 113 queries in the entire dataset. The distribution of the queries ple linear regression could be 1 through 113.

Identifying coefficients of multiple linear regression . The coefficients of the multiple linear regression equa-tion are determined using the first half of the dataset. Multiple factor ANOVA is also performed. The details of how these methods can be applied are in Montgomery (1991) .

Applying multiple linear regression on the second half of the dataset . In order to validate the multiple linear regression equation, the second portion of the Excite dataset is used. By using time interval, search pattern and query order values as independent factors, we determine whether the query is a topic shift or not using the regression equation. Naturally, the regression equation yields a real number. However, the answer has to be of the form 1 or 2, where 1 is topic continuation and 2 is topic shift. In order to bring the regression equa-tions response to a binary form, we apply a threshold value. The threshold is selected as 1.5 in this study, since 1.5 is the median between 1 and 2, and the regression was trained to provide answers between 1 and 2. Testing the regression equation with other threshold values is an area of further research. If the response of the multi-ple linear equation is less than 1.5, the query is considered as a continuation, and if, the response of the multi-ple linear equation is greater than 1.5, the query is considered as a topic shift. We consider 1.5 as a threshold in this study, since we did not want to keep a bias towards topic shifts or continuations.

Comparison of results from human expert and the multiple linear regression equation . The results of the multi-ple linear regression equation tested on the second half of the Excite dataset are compared to the actual topic shifts and identifications determined by the human expert. Correct and incorrect estimates of topic shift and continuation are marked and the statistics in the notation section are calculated, which are used in the eval-uation of results.

Evaluation of results . The performance of the multiple linear regression equation is evaluated in terms of the performance measures given in the previous section (Eqs. (5) X (9) ). Higher performance measure values mean higher success in topic identification. 4. Results and discussion
The multiple linear regression equation, where topic shifts are the dependent factor and the characteristics of the query log are the independent factors is as follows:
Using this regression equation, it may be possible to identify topic shifts and continuations in a Web search query log. To test the validity of the regression equation, hence perform the hypothesis test in Eq. (11) , the F value for the regression equation is determined. The sum of squares and the calculation of the F value is as in
Table 5 . The F value for the regression equation is 317.19. The critical F value is F 2.10. The regression equation is valid and the relationship between the topic shifts and characteristics of the search queries is statistically significant. This results shows that there is a certain relationship between non-semantic characteristics of search queries and occurrence of topic shifts/continuations. Hence, a Web user might be demonstrating certain querying patterns, when he/she is about to make a topic shift. These results are also indication that content-ignorant topic identification methodologies can be successful for automatic new topic identification.

We applied multiple factor ANOVA to investigate the effect of the characteristics of the search queries on topic shifts. The results of the multiple factor ANOVA are in Table 6 . The critical F value for testing the effect of each factor is F 0.05,1,3806 , which is equal to 3.84. From these results, we observe that the independent main factors TI (time interval), SP (search pattern) and QN (query number) are effective on occurrence of topic shifts/continuations. In earlier studies, the position of a query was not considered as one of the characteristics that could affect topic shifts and continuations. In addition, the interaction of TI and SP is also effective on topic shifts/continuations. The other interaction effects do not have an impact on topic shifts/continuations.
This might mean that at certain time interval and search pattern combinations, the occurrence of topic shifts and continuations increase. It requires further research to identify exactly which time interval and search pat-tern combinations cause this effect.

When the human expert evaluated the 10,003 query dataset, 7059 topic continuations and 421 topic shifts were found. Eliminating the last query of each session leaves 7480 queries to be included in the analysis. In the subset used for training (first half of the dataset (5014 queries), there are 3544 topic continuations and 269 topic shifts, and in the second half of the dataset (4989 queries), there are 3515 topic continuations and 152 topic shifts. The structure of the dataset in terms of number of sessions and the number of queries included in the analysis is shown in Table 1 .

After applying the multiple linear regression equation on the second half of the dataset, the results we obtained are summarized in Table 7 . The reader should recall that we use 1.5 as the threshold to convert the response of the regression equation to the bipolar response of 1 or 2, corresponding to topic continuations or shifts. From Table 7 , we observe that the multiple linear regression equation marked 3441 queries as topic continuation, whereas the human expert identified 3515 queries as topic continuation. Similarly, the regression equation marked 226 queries as topic shifts, whereas the human expert identified 152 queries as topic shifts.
During the topic identification process, we observed 146 Type A errors and 72 Type B errors. Using the multi-ple linear regression approach, 80 out of 152 topic shifts are identified correctly, yielding an R 0.526 and 3369 out of 3515 topic continuations are identified correctly, yielding an R
These results demonstrate that of the topic shifts were estimated somewhat correctly and topic continuations were estimated almost entirely correctly by the regression equation. On the other hand, the regression equa-tion yielded 226 topic shifts, when actually there are 152 topic shifts, giving a value of 0.354 for P results means that the regression equation overestimates the number of topic shifts. This result could be due to the value of the threshold used to convert the responses of the regression equation to bipolar responses of 1 and 2. In terms of topic continuations P contin was 0.979, 3369 topic continuations out of 3441 topic con-tinuations were estimated correctly, i.e. almost all, but 2%, of the topic continuations marked by the regression equation were correct. 5. Comparison with other methods of classification
In order to measure the performance of the regression approach in estimating topic shifts, it would be ben-eficial to compare its estimation power to those of other methodologies. We, therefore, compare the regression approach to a popular statistical learning method; support vector machines (SVM).
 The estimation of topic shifts and continuation can be seen as a problem of text classification. Currently, SVMs are the most accurate classifiers for text ( Chakrabarti, 2003 ). The main principle of SVM is to separate different classes with a hyperplane that maximizes the distance between classes ( Osuna, Freund, &amp; Girosi, 1996 ). SVM involves solving a quadratic programming problem with linear equality and inequality constraints ( Osuna et al., 1996 ). To get more information on the theoretical background, different types and different for-mulations of SVM, the interested reader can refer to Vapnik (1995), Osuna et al. (1996), Burges (1998), Chak-rabarti (2003) and Chang &amp; Lin (2001) .

In our study, we use the LIBSVM developed by Chang and Lin (2001) . Topic shifts were labeled as 1 and topic continuations as 1. In order to receive the best results SVM can offer, we tried to solve SVM with dif-ferent options. Initially, we tried C-SVC (support vector classification) with the default values of the software, hence C was equal to 1, and the kernel function was the radial basis function. The results are given in Table 8 .
Then, we tried C-SVC with C equal to 10 and C equal to 100. We also tried C-SVC with linear, polynomial and sigmoid kernel functions. g -SVM is omitted, since it is similar to C-SVM. In addition, e -SVR is applied, with default e equal to 0.1, where the threshold for topic shifts and continuation is zero (if label is below zero, the query is labeled as continuation, and shift otherwise). Shrinking and caching is not used, since the problem size was easily managable.

We observe that almost none of the SVM types and options were successful in estimating topic shifts. Espe-cially, P shift is very poor, equal to 0%, in all the SVM trials, except C-SVC with linear kernel function, which has a P shift value of 0.244, still lower than that of multiple linear regression. P the SVM variants, but this is due to the fact that SVM labels all the queries as topic continuations. The high values of P contin do not provide a significant advantage to SVM methods, since multiple linear regression also provided a P contin value of 0.979. Only C-SVC with a linear kernel function provided a better result in terms of
Type B errors, however, worse in terms of Type A errors, pulling the R nomial kernel function did not converge (was stopped at one hour of run-time). Consequently, multiple linear regression provides more successful results compared to SVM, one of the most popular and accurate methods for text classification. Comparing all the approaches using F the better performance overall compared to SVM. 6. Conclusion
This study uses multiple linear regression and multiple factor ANOVA to identify the relationships between topic shifts and the non-semantic characteristics of the search queries, and successfully estimate topic shifts and continuations. The non-semantic characteristics of the search queries are the time interval of queries, the search pattern of queries and the order of a query in a search session.

Hypothesis testing showed that the multiple linear regression equation is statistically valid, which demon-strates that there is a valid relationship between non-semantic characteristics of user queries and topic shifts and continuations. Multiple factor ANOVA showed that the non-semantic factors of time interval, search pat-tern and query position in the user session, as well as the search pattern and time interval interaction, have a statistically significant effect on topic shifts. These results provide statistical proof that Web users demonstrate a certain way of behavior when they are about to make topic shifts or continue on a topic, which is exacer-bated when a certain combination of search pattern and time interval occurs. The determination of exact multi-tasking behavior patterns requires future research. These findings also indicate that, since non-semantic characteristics of query logs are relevant to topic shifts/continuations, content-ignorant methodologies for automatic new topic identification can be a promising line of research.

We also used the proposed multiple regression equation to estimate topic shifts and continuations on the second portion of the dataset. The regression equation was quite successful in estimating topic shifts and con-tinuations, and performed better compared to popular text categorization tools such as SVM. However, the number of topic shifts was overestimated. Future work includes repeating the linear regression approach on more datasets from different search engines to test its performance of automatic new topic identification. References
