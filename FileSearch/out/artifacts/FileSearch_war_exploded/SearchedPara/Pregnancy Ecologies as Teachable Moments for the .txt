 I investigate the potential for mobile health communication and social collaboration technologies (mHealth) to have a positive impact on pregnancy for lower-income American women. Recognizing that pregnancy is more than medical health, I set out to understand what pregnancy is for this population and how the embodied experience of pregnancy impacts women X  X  lives. I have initiated a mixed methods study , which uses focus groups, interviews, information landscape analysis and social media discourse analysis. From the prel iminary focus group and interview data, I have created a structuring health concept that I call the pregnancy ecology, accounting for the multi-faceted experience of pregnancy as a transformational event. The future work will incorporate all of the data into a holistic health ecology concept for pregnancy. Using this concept, I intend to design and build a mHealth app that treats pregnancy as a teachable moment for health, wellness and social support throughout the lifecourse.
 ACM Classification Keywords INTRODUCTION Appropriate pregnancy management for lower income women in developed nations is part of the Millennium Goals for Maternal and Child Health [1] from the Worl d Health Organization (WHO). Recognizing that maternal health impacts mother and child, the WHO suggests that a way to address healthy pregnancy is to treat it as a social issue. They further suggest that this issue is addressable through the design of appropriate health information and health social support networks, delivered via mobile devices [5]. In order to design appropriate mH ealth interventions for this period of life, the WHO suggests the use of approaches that account for the network of people, health issues, informational needs and social support required for a women to have healthy pregnancies and produce healthy offspring. Healthier pregnancies mean less risk of pregnancy-related health complications (e.g.: gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, caesarean delivery, post-partum obesity) and lower fetal and infant mortality rates [10]. Despite the multiple touchpoints, influencers and forces that impact a woman X  X  pregnancy management practices, pregnancy in the United States is often treated as a medical issue, stemming from the way the period of pregnancy is dominated by medical care. Women and their partners are expected to turn to medical practitioners for advice and information. Consequently, the care and treatment given to pregnant women focuses narrowly on health activities like diet, exercise and medical planning. But a gap in care exists. In American medicine, care for pregnancy often does not begin until the end of the first trimester, particularly among the lower income demographic [8,12]. Yet women often want information immediately upon finding out they are pregnancy, and like many current health consumers, women turn to the Internet for information, using mobile devices [4]. The structural gap in care results in women turning to their social networks, to the Internet, and to  X  X or profit X  mobile apps for pregnancy advice and information. Following the WHO recommendations, I am working to address the reality of pregnancy for lower income women within a new paradigm for mobile health application design and information provision. This is intended to provide more appropriate pregnancy management interventions, through technology as well as through clinical care. To approach pregnancy from this perspective, my methods and design guidelines were directed by three research questions: 1. What does pregnancy look like and act like for lower-income 2. What happens to design planning if I shift the understanding of 3. What does an ecological approach to pregnancy do to change APPROACH &amp; METHODS To direct my research and design activities, I am working with two medical doctors specializing in women X  X  health, and two other HCI researchers, all four of whom are faculty members at my university. Because we understand that health interventions and mobile UX design efficacy are both shaped and determined by users X  subjective experiences, we have designed a mixed methods approach to understanding the pregnancy ecology of our target population of lower-income pregnant women. We started with a qualitative study of lower-income women served by Women and Infant Care (WIC) federal assistance clinics in Penn sylvania. We conducted four focus groups of 4-6 women each. Drawing on what we learned in those focus group interactions (Figure 2), we recruited 6 additional women for design-directed intervie ws. In those interviews, I met with 6 pregnant women in their homes, with their husbands or partners where possible. I led them in a series of exercises around current app and website use. I solicited their feedback on GUIs, information paradigms and appropriateness of existing systems for their informational and support needs. FINDINGS There are four preliminary fi ndings from the initial research activities, which shape what I have called the  X  X regnancy ecology X  (Figure 1): 1. Women reject medical guidelines for pregnancy, seeing them 2. Women X  X  bodies rule them during pregnancy, as a result of 3. Women turn to  X  X r. Google X  for advice, because medical 4.  X  X usbands X  are key drivers to healthy sane pregnancies, rather As a concept, the pregnancy ecology is influenced by a fusion of social science [12,13], information science [7] and HCI [3]. The concept accounts for the forces, influe nces and events that shape the experience and health of pregnant lower-income American woman. Based in our participants X  stories, the pregnancy ecology has five major facets: medical; social; informational; technical; and intangibles; each with correspondi ng actors. Each of the ecology facets acts as influences on a woman X  X  subjective experience of pregnancy, as a health event, as a social event and as a life event. The stories we heard from partic ipants about the multi-faceted experience of pregnancy (see Figure 2 for examples) underscores for me that pregnancy should be understood by mHealth designers as a bounded experience within the life course of a woman and her family, as opposed to a medical health issue. Shifting the focus away from medi cine and towards health and wellness suggests that the informati onal triggers in existing mHealth initiatives may be flawed and shor t sighted. The existing paradigms work on risk reduction paradigms, such as diet and exercise tracking period of pregnancy can be treated as a  X  X eachable moment X  for encouraging healthy life manageme nt techniques for stress, diet, time and other concerns for the pregnant woman and her core supporters, and that this approach can be supported through a corresponding mHealth design. An ecological approach to mHealth design should continue to incorporate diet and exercise recommendations, but should also include informational triggers for holistic health, social and overall life support, rather than merely reinforcing medical guidelines for health. DESIGN IMPLICATIONS This means that an ecologically-aware pregnancy mHealth design should incorporate, for example: 1. information and support on strategies for improving sleep; 2. maintaining healthy relationshi ps in times of stress and 3. downplaying the negative effects of food aversions and 4. supporting healthy emotional and social states despite All of these aspects of life are variable during pregnancy, and women and their significant others have a vested interest in appropriately managing the life variability. The social support aspect of pregnancy is recognized in prior HCI work as a core part of health management [6,9,11], yet often in design work about pregnancy and early parenting, the father is curiously invisible. Because women expressed a decided interest in enabling their spouses to be fully involved in pregnancy m anagement, as well as solicit assistance and share key milestones in an effective manner to a trus ted group of close confidantes, a pregnancy app should enable appropriate social support, so that the social cohesion of a woman X  X  life is respected during the period of change that is pregnancy. FUTURE WORK Ongoing research work includes a landscape analysis of the existing information and social support apps, websites and literature for pregnancy, alongside an investigation into pregnancy talk on Twitter. For my future work, I intend to create a design prototype for a pregnancy mHealth system for lower-income American women. To do so, guided by value-based design principles from Action Research and Participatory Design, I foresee conducting design workshops with pregnant women and their spouses. I anticipate that the app would incorporate aspects of the pregnancy ecology. I forsee the app presenting health information, providing behavioural  X  X udges X  [2] and offering social support avenues for pregnancy. The meta-goal of the app would be to frame a woman X  X  pregnancy as a  X  X eachable moment X  that scaffolds better life-long adaptation to embodied health, social and emotional support, and improved feelings of wellness capacity. CONTRIBUTION I expect to realize the overall goal of my dissertation project through the design of a mobile-enabled health and wellness approach to pregnancy management support skill s. This approach would move pregnancy mHealth design away from medical information, diet and exercise tracking, and risk discourses, toward the use of pregnancy as a teachable moment in encouraging healthy life management practices generally.
