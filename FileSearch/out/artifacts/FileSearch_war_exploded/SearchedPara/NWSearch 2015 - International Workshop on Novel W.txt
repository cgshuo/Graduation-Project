 Held for the first time in conjunction with the ACM Inter-national Conference on Information and Knowledge Man-agement (CIKM), NWSearch 2015 aims to bring together researchers, developers and practitioners who are interested in pushing the search boundary on the Web and exploring more novel forms of searches, interfaces, task formulations, and result organizations and presentations. In particular, the workshop seeks to identify some of the problems and challenges facing the development of such tools and inter-faces and to flourish new ideas and findings that can shape or influence future research directions and developments. The workshop organizers solicited contributions that would fall within the large spectrum of human-computer interaction in one extreme and system production and development in the other extreme.
 H.3.3 [ Information Systems ]: Information Retrieval; H.3.0 [ Information Systems ]: World Wide Web Algorithms; Design; Human Factors; Experimentation The World Wide Web offers one of the largest and most di-verse collection of documents, and this provides both chal-lenges and opportunities in searching and mining the collec-tion. The traditional method of searching the collection has been through using some keyword queries, browsing top few answers (referred to as  X 10 blue links X ) and sometimes navi-gating the links. While this simple interface is effective and serves many general needs, it is very primitive in expressing more complex tasks and search scenarios. For example, too many searches require more than one query, and once the relevant documents are found, not much else is done on those documents. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers, developers and practitioners who are interested the search; they also report a break-down of the results for single-faceted and multi-faceted searches.
 A paper by Gkirtzou, Papastefanatos and Dalamagas [1] studies keyword search on RDF data and the problem of mapping keyword searches to SPARQL queries. The authors report a summary of their previous work on the subject, and the steps of breaking down the problem into (1) finding a set of matches for each keyword in the RDF graph, (2) enumer-ating the cartesian product of the matching sets, (3) gener-ating what is referred to as augmented summary graph , and (4) mapping augmented summary graphs to query graphs. The augmented summary graph represents an aggregated summary of the matching RDF data as well as the graph entries for matched elements. A query pattern graph is de-rived based on the shortest paths between the matched ele-ments. The authors discuss an evaluation scheme and some findings on the effectiveness of their mappings.
 Zhao, Meng, Wang and Li [4] present a method that uses encyclopedic data to provide a query understanding. The authors highlight some of the shortcomings of named entity recognizers (such as Standard NER) when applied to short texts such as queries, hence the need for mapping queries to entities in an encyclopedia or a knowledge base to under-stand the query semantics. The authors present a method to map keyphrases in queries to relevant entities in a knowledge base. From the entities matching a query and the categories of those entities, the authors try to build a topic model of the query. The paper uses LDA topic model in particular and report experiments on a set of queries from Sougou World Wide Web competition and a comparison with alternative methods.
 Finally, Liska, Sojka and Ruzicka [2] present their work on combining text and formula queries in mathematical in-formation retrieval. The authors report their experiments on various query relaxation strategies for queries that in-clude both formulas matching mathematical expressions and text matching the surrounding natural language text. The query relaxation assumes a conjunction semantics and ex-plores splitting the queries into more intermediate expres-sions by dropping some pieces, evaluating those expressions and merging the results. The evaluation is done based on the NTCIR-11 Math-2 Task collection and the relevance judge-ments provided by the organizers.
