 News topics, which are constructed from news stories using the techniques of Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT), bring convenience to users who intend to see what is going on through the Internet. However, it is almost impossible to view all the generated topics, because of the large amount. So it will be timely and important, can be viewed with high priority. Generally, topic ranking is determined by two primary factors. One is how frequently and recently a topic is reported by the media; the other is how much attention users pay to it. Both media focus and user attention varies as time goes on, so the effect of time on topic ranking has already been included. However, inconsistency exists between both factors. In this pa per, an automatic online news topic ranking algorithm is pr oposed based on inconsistency analysis between media focus and user attention. News stories are organized into topics, which are ranked in terms of both media focus and user attention. Experiments performed on practical Web datasets show that the topic ranking result reflects the influence of time, the media and users. The ma in contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we present the quantitative measure of the inconsistency between media focus and user attention, which provides a basis for topic ranking a nd an experimental evidence to show that there is a gap between what the media provide and what attempt to synthesize the two factors into one algorithm for automatic online topic ranking.

News stories are gathered from many Websites and organized into news topics by practic al Web applications like Google News (http://news.google.com/). Topics are constructed and updated online automatically, using the techniques of Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [1]. News TDT results have greatly facilitated users who want to know about  X  X  hat X  X  new X  or  X  X hat X  X  going on X . However, with the vast amount of news topics created and updated all the time, it is almost im possible for users to view them all. So a new problem arises: how to rank the news topics to show the top ones with high priority, which are both timely and important? 
Two simple rules are separately us ed for ranking news topics in [21]: ranking by the time when the topics are updated; ranking by focuses on returning timely resu lts and the second one considers larger topics more important. Eith er rule involves only one aspect of the ranking problem. Besides th em, more factors must be taken its importance, while the contri bution decays along the timeline; (2) topics that attract more users X  attention should be ranked higher. 
On the whole, topic ranking is determined by two primary factors. First, how frequently and recently is the topic reported by news Websites? This factor is called media focus . Second, how much do users like to read news stories about the topic? This one is called user attention . Both media focus and user attention varies as time goes on, so the effect of time on topic ranking has already been included by the two factors. However, inconsistency exists between both factors. Detailed explanations are as follows: 
A topic reported frequently by the media does not always attract close attention of users, because users may judge it as unimportant (although there are ma ny news stories about it). There are also many other reasons, such as unattractive news titles, uninteresting subjects, unnoticed positions and so on. Therefore media focus itself is not enough for topic ranking. 
In contrast, a topic reported poo rly by the media might attract many users X  attention, such as, when news stories of the topic users X  life and interests. There also exist other reasons, such as the effect of anchor texts. News stories are mainly from authority pages [13], which are pointed to by news index pages (hub pages, such as homepages of news We bsites) with hyperlinks. Users often view the news stories through clicks on the hyperlinks, so not. Attractive or even odd anchor texts that have nothing to do with the real content will help stories win much user attention, but in fact users are just cheated by the anchor texts. Hence only user attention is not enough fo r topic ranking, either. 
The inconsistency between media focus and user attention is studied and calculated quantitatively in this paper. Media focus and user attention of topics is calculated online automatically based on an aging theory. Topics with high values of both media focus and user attention are ranked high. 
There are two problems to be investigated in news topic ranking: (1) How to calculate medi a focus and user attention of topics and the inconsistency betw een both? (2) How to rank topics, taking into account all mentioned factors? 
Motivated by these problems, we propose a news topic ranking algorithm in this paper. The state-of-the-art TDT techniques are used to organize news pages fr om a lot of news Websites into topics. An aging theory is added in the TDT process. In the meantime, media focus and user attention of topics is calculated. Finally, topics are ranked online automatically. 
The contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) we define and analyze the quantitative measure of the inconsistency between media focus and user attention, which provides a basis for topic ranking. (2) We propose a news topic ranking algorithm using both media focus and user attenti on, which has not been studied, to the best of our knowledge. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a detection and tracking algorithm based on aging theory and burstiness of terms. The topi c ranking algorithm based on inconsistency analysis between media focus and user attention is proposed in section 4. We descri be the experimental data and results, and discuss on the results in Section 5, followed by the conclusion and a discussion of future work in Section 6. 
Topic detection and tracking (TDT ) are intended to structure news stories from newswires and broadcasts into topics [1]. Approaches in TDT were mainly variants and improvements of the single pass method and agglomerative clustering algorithms time information  X  X id not help X  improve the new event detection results, some recent work has utilized the aging theory or timeline analysis, and achieved good performance in TDT and hot topic extraction [4, 5]. The state-of-the-art TDT techniques are used to generate topics from news storie s in our work. We also apply the aging theory both in the TDT process and the calculation of media focus and user attention. Howeve r, traditional TDT tasks [1] are not the main focus of our work. 
Other work involving both topic detection and timeline analysis is mostly in the retrospective way: topic hierarchy construction based on identification of bursty periods of features [8]; topic sentence extraction along a timelin e given a query [6]; topic detection based on identification of both aperiodic and periodic features X  bursts [10]; finding top bursty topics by identifying bursty words [11]; and so on. Previous approaches listed above analyzed the characteristics of features from a fixed corpus on the whole timeline, and hence have to be adjusted to suit to online use. Our system deals with dynamic-in creasing news data online, and makes use of an aging theory [4] in topic detection and tracking. 
Fung et al proposed a feature-pivot clustering approach, using  X  X he time information to determin e a set of bursty features which may occur in different time windows X  [9]. Bursty topics were detected by grouping bursty features based on the feature finally. 
Chen et al presented a hot topic extraction approach based on timeline analysis and multi-dimensional sentence modeling [5]. Hot terms were firstly  X  X xtracted by mapping their distribution over time X  and key sentences were then identified and  X  X rouped characteristics of hot topics were considered in [5]: appearing in many news stories and many ne ws channels; strong continuity; popularity variation over time. Our work is different from [9] and [5]: (1) all topics are ranked. Topic ranking is actually a di fferent problem from bursty/hot clustered for users X  quick access. (3) The approaches in [9] and [5] required information from a fixed corpus on the whole timeline, while our system deals with dynamic-increasing data online. 
He et al proposed a semi-automa tic hot topic detection algorithm in [12]. They detected new topics  X  X y using incremental TF-IDF model and incremental clustering algorithm X . Topics were finally ranked by the frequencies of topic reported in time units and the number of consecutive effective time units. However, their approach is heuristics, not particularly well justified. 
A distinct feature of our approach from all previous work lies in the consideration of users X  eff ect on topic ranking. The proposed algorithm performs an inconsiste ncy analysis between media focus and user attention, which is novel, to the best of our introduced and the topic ranking result reflects the influence of time, the media and users. 
The first stage of topic ranking is to organize news stories, published by various Websites, into topics. We utilize our topic detection and tracking algorithm based on clustering [21], considering the characteristics of news appearance. A topic is considered as a life form and an aging theory is used to model its life span [4]. The burstiness of terms is calculated and added in the story representation. Newly appearing stories are firstly clustered into new topic candidates, which are used to track previous  X  X live X  topics. A new topi c is generated if the candidate is not combined with any previous topic. Previous topics become popular with the insertion of new stories, and fade away with time. The whole topic detection a nd tracking process is performed online automatically. 
Chen et al applied an aging theory to model a news topic X  X  life span and considered a news topic as  X  X  life form with stages of birth, growth, decay and death X  [4]. They used the concept of energy function to track the life cycles of topics. The value of span. The energy of a topic increases when it becomes popular and decreases as its popularity de cays. Like in the nutriology, things that contribute to the energy of topics (e.g. new stories inserted into the topics) are called nutrition . 
The timeline is divided into time slots of equal length. We energy of topics in every time slot: z getNutrition() calculates the nutrition that a topic receives z energyFunction() converts a topic nutrition value into an z energyDecay() carries out the energy decrease in each time 
Topics are related to a set of keywords [8]. New topics usually appear along with some bursty term s, and stories with the same bursty terms are more probabl y from the same topic. The relationship between topics and corresponding bursty keywords has been utilized previously [8, 9, 10, 11, 17, 18]. We make use of the burstiness of terms to obtain better TDT results, analogous to what [11] did in topic clustering. 
The calculation of term burstiness is in a similar way to [18]. If we model stories of topics as a random process with an unknown binomial distribution, we can check the associations between contingency table, as shown in Table 1: where z A is the count of storie s that contain term w in time slot i ; z B is the count of stories that contain term w outside time slot z C is the count of stories that don X  X  contain term w in time z D is the count of stories that don X  X  contain term w outside 
We use the 2  X  statistic formula to calculate the burstiness of term w during time slot i : News pages are gathered from news Websites by crawlers. Then the crawled pages are analyzed to get the main body. Their titles and content are extracted along with metadata such as publishing date, category, source and images. A news Web page X  X  content part (including the title) is called a story. 
We split stories into sentences and remove redu ndant sentences in a story because they usually bring in nothing useful but noises. Titles are weighted and added to the story representation. And then we tokenize words (word segmentation is performed when dealing with Chinese texts), perform part-of-speech tagging, recognize named entiti es and remove stopwords. Finally a term vector is created for each story. 
Incremental TF-IDF model is widely applied to term weight calculation in TDT [2, 3, 22, 23]. We choose this model as a base to weight terms. DF (document frequency) of term w in time slot i is calculated as: df (w) means the number of stories that term w appears in. df represents the number of stories that term w appears in before sufficient amount of stories is used for the calculation of DF initially. As shown in formula (2), DF is updated dynamically in each time slot i . 
Then each story d in time slot i is represented as an n -dimension vector, where n is the number of distinct terms in story d . Each dimension is we ighted using a combination of incremental TF-IDF model and B-VSM model [11], which considers the unit length: where tf(d, w) means how many times term w appears in story d (included). Cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity between two stories. For story d and d X  , their similarity is calculated as: 
We combine our TDT algorithm proposed in [21] with the aging theory described in Section 3.1 to perform online topic detection and tracking. Topics are generated and updated with stories coming in chronological order, one time slot after another. Topics are represented as term vectors, which are defined as the arithmetic average of term vectors of all stories within them. The algorithm is shown in Figure 1: 
Figure 1. Topic detection, tracking and energy calculation 
New coming stories are clustere d into new topic candidates, using the state-of-the-art clusteri ng algorithms [24]. The similarity equals to the inner product betw een term vectors of topics t and t similarity calculation. e represents the energy value of topic t in time slot i . The energyFunction () used in this paper is a sigmoid function, analogous to that used in [4], defined as: 
It is easy to see that 0  X  energyFunction ( x )&lt;1. | t c | is the number of stories contained in topic t threshold track and the coefficient used in the increase of the nutrition (  X  m ) are determined by experiments with training data.
The energy of a topic increases when new stories are added to the topic, and decreases as time goes by. The energy value of When no or few stories are added to a topic, its energy value will gradually decline. If the energy value is below a threshold, the topic is considered  X  X ead X  an d removed from the topic set T to keep all topics in the news reading system up to date. The topic removal algorithm based on energy decay is analogous to that of [4], described in Figure 2: 
Figure 2. Topic removal algo rithm based on energy decay  X  X ead X  topics are put in T remove . The decay factor  X  determined by experiment s with training data. 
Through investigation of characteristics of topics, we have found out that topic ranking is dete rmined by two pr imary factors: media focus and user attention. Media focus quantifies how frequently and recently the topic is reported by the media, and user attention measures how much and recently users like to read news stories about the topic. Both factors vary as time goes on, so the effect of time on topic ranking has already been included. However, inconsistency exists between both factors. We calculate media focus and user attention of topics and rank the topics by considering both factors. 
Media focus indicates how frequently and recently topics are reported by the media. The energy value of topics calculated in Section 3.3 shows the liveliness of topics from the perspective of the media. Therefore, we use the energy value of a topic in each time slot as the value of media focus on the topic directly. In this way, media focus values of topics are calculated online automatically: slot i . 
User attention represents how much and recently users pay attention to topics. Anonymous Web page view information is collected for the user attention calculation, with the help of a Web browser toolbar from a major commercial Website in China (http://www.sohu.com/). Web browse r toolbars become more and more popular recently. Many search engine companies (e.g. Google, Yahoo, Baidu...) have re leased toolbar software to the wisdom of the crowds. Therefore it X  X  not difficult to collect T = null; For each time slot i New coming stories are cluste red into new topic candidates; For each new topic candidate t c If sim( t , t c ) &gt; threshold track then Nutrition of t currently: n t = energyFunction For each story d in t c Combine t c to t , and update the term vector of t ; End for For each time slot i For each topic t in T Else 
End for Web page view information of user s, and our algorithm is full of practicability. 
In this proposed system, news pages are gathered from many news Websites by crawlers, and users X  page view behavior on these Websites can be extracte d from the anonymous Web page view information that we have collected on the whole Web. In this way, we get a sample of users X  page view information on news Websites. At present, this sample is directly used to calculate user attention values of news topics. 
Actually, the system we proposed in this paper is also a news reading Website. We have not taken the user behavior on our system into consideration, because it is sort of a positive feedback, which is not our focus in this paper. 
Similar to the media focus calculation, the user attention is also calculated based on the aging theory. Every page view of any story about topic t is considered as viewing t once. The page time goes by. 
We make use of three functi ons from [4] to calculate and update the user attention of topics in every time slot. The nutrition attention value of topic t in time slot i . The user attention values of new topics are set as 0 initially. The algorithm is shown in Figure 3:  X  u and  X  u are determined by experiments with training data. Note that user attention values of topics in T remove calculated, because users may continue their attention to a topic even if it is not reported by the media any more. 
For each topic, the values of media focus and user attention are varying in each time slot. Moreover, the user attention is usually delayed a little bit than the media focus, because users read news unnecessary to put media focus and user attention of a topic in alignment, and measure the inconsistency between both in every time slot. 
The inconsistency between media focus and user attention is quantitatively measured, in consid eration of the following factors: (1) the accumulative media focus and user attention values are more reasonable and avoids the pr oblem of aligning both factors; accumulative media focus and user attention values of these topics calculation, in order to make the result of statistical significance. 
Figure 4 below shows the media focus and user attention values of topic t along its lifetime. The length of time slots in actual use values in the last time slot of each day are shown in Figure 4, for the sake of clear demonstration. 
Figure 4. Media focus and user attention values of topic t
The area of the shaded part in Figure 4 represents the accumulative media focus value of topic t , which is calculated as: Similarly, the accumulative user attention value of topic t is calculated as: 
The inconsistency between media focus and user attention is quantitatively measured using the Pearson correlation coefficient: y in equation (9), the correlation between media focus and user attention can be calculated in each time slot and the inconsistency value is calculated as 1-r xy . 
Topics are ranked by considering both media focus and user attention values in each time slot online automatically. Therefore we calculate the values of topi cs for ranking by the combination For each time slot i View value of t currently: v t = energyFunction Else End if 
End for of the media focus and user attention values, in the most intuitive way: where  X  ( 1 0  X   X   X  ) can be set different values according to actual needs. 
The user attention is usually delayed than the media focus, because news stories are read after the issuance. The question is how soon users X  attention is attracted to the news stories issued by news Websites. Our previous work found out that on the day of birth, most news pages accumulate more than 80% of the total page views in their whole lifet ime [20]. Anonymous Web page view information on news Websites is collected online all the time, therefore we consider the user attention values calculated are timely enough for topic ranking. 
Topics seldom reported by the media or poorly viewed by users recently get very small ranking values according to equation (10). Topics with large values of both media focus and user attention varying in each time slot, the topics are ranked online automatically. 
Preliminary experiments are firstly performed on a training dataset to find proper values for parameters. Then the analysis on results of calculating inconsistenc y between media focus and user attention is demonstrated. The disc ussions of topic ranking results are presented finally. 
Experiments are performed on datasets constructed from practical Web environment. Craw lers are gathering news pages from dozens of Chinese news Websites all the time. The collected (http://www.google.com/), Yahoo! (http://www.yahoo.com/) and etc. We focus on the search engine related domain because: (1) we X  X e familiar with the domain; (2) the proposed system is initially designed for watching topi cs of the search engine related domain online. In fact, it is not n ecessary to consider datasets with multi-domain news because news stories of various categories are usually put in corresponding ch annels of news Websites. 
News stories published from Jan 1 to Oct 31, 2007 are studied parts: z TrainingSet: contains 14,602 news stories, published from z TestingSet: contains 38,767 news pages, published from 
Anonymous Web page view inform ation is collected for user attention calculation, from Jan 1 to Dec 31, 2007, which contains over 10.64 billion page views in 1.51 billion Web pages and 78.2 million user sessions. Page view information of news stories in TrainingSet and TestingSet is ex tracted (0.6 million user page views) to calculate the values of user attention to the generated topics. 
Preliminary experiments are performed on TrainingSet to find proper values for parameters: threshold track ,  X  m ,  X  Topics are generated and u pdated using traditional TDT algorithms from [21]. 50 topics are labeled by assessors. The TDT results on the labeled topics are best with threshold track = 0. 182.  X   X  are calculated as the method used in [4]: For each topic, a of the total energy. By using two points ( r 1 , s 1 ) and ( r  X  can be solved. We use the averages of  X  m ,  X  m ,  X  u topics as the final parameter values:  X  m = 0.251031,  X   X  u = 0.008478 and  X  u = 0.001846. 
TestingSet is used to perform the automatic online news topic ranking experiment. The length of time slots is 15 minutes. The topic detection and tracking algor ithm described in Section 3 is performed, with 2,517 topics ge nerated totally. It X  X  time consuming to give an overall evaluation on the TDT results because the dataset is from practical Web and in lack of complete annotation. We just trust in th e state-of-the-art TDT techniques adopted and the results of preliminary experiments. Some evaluation on TDT results can be found in our previous work [21]. Furthermore, we had 5 assessors (no author is among them) view the results and their feedbacks are summarized as follows: most combined as one. 
The correlation between media focus and user attention is calculated in the last time slot of each day, as Section 4.2 described. The correlation coefficient on each day is shown as Figure 5: 
Figure 5. Pearson correlation coefficient between media focus and user attention on each day from Apr 1 to Oct 31, 2007 
Figure 5 shows that the correlation coefficient between media focus and user attention is unstabl e at the beginning, but soon gets steadier when more and more topics are included in the calculation. In most cases, the value is between 0.4 and 0.6. Therefore it can be deduced that the inconsistency value, which is that there is indeed inconsiste ncy between media focus and user attention. 
Some topics with discrepant values of accumulative media focus and user attention are shown in Figure 6. Only the values in the last time slot of each day are displayed: 
Figure 6. Some topics with di screpant values of accumulative 
As show in Figure 6, corresponding topic names are put below the figures. The reasons for inc onsistent media focus and user attention have been discussed in Section 1, and we guess the the topics. 
Topics are ranked in every time slot online automatically, using the method described in Section 4.3. The length of time slots is 15 minutes.  X  in equation (10) is set as 0.5, treating media focus and user attention equally. Part of th e screenshot of the result page of our topic ranking system is shown as Figure 7:

Figure 7 shows the top 3 topics on search engine related companies at 8:00 a. m., Oct 26 , 2007, which talk about  X  X he upcoming Alibaba IPO in Hong Kong X ,  X  X aidu to enter C2C E-commerce Market X  and  X  X icrosoft invests $240 million in Facebook X , respectively. the anchor texts of the hyperlinks linking to topics and news stories currently. Snippets of the latest news story are shown as the summaries of topics. In this way, the up-to-date status of a topic will be viewed. Users will read more about the current progress, background and history th rough a hyperlink like  X  X ll 367 news articles X . Images of re lated news are added and shown automatically. It is also worth noting that media focus and user attention curves are provided for users to know the topic trends. 
The result of topic ranking using both media focus and user attention is compared with that of using only media focus, as shown in Table 2. The names of top 10 topics are demonstrated: The result of Figure 7 has been translated into English at

As shown in Table 2, the topic ranking results of using both factors and that of using only media focus are compared. The same topics are in the same colors. The symbols  X  and  X  indicate a change of rank by introducing the user focus to the ranking purely by the media focus, and new means the topic is not included in the top 10 of the media focus based ranking result, but in the top 10 of the ranking result based on both media focus and user attention.

It X  X  difficult to give an accura te evaluation on the topic ranking result. We had 22 users (no aut hor is among them) with various backgrounds (undergraduate stude nts, graduate students and engineers) view the topic ranking result page, part of which is proposed topic ranking algorithm refl ects the influence of time, the media and users, which is more reasonable compared to the result of using media focus only. 
In this paper, we propose a novel automatic online algorithm for news topic ranking based on an aging theory, using both media focus and user attention. Both media focus and user attention varies as time goes on, so the ef fect of time on topic ranking has already been included. Inconsistency exists between media focus and user attention, which is analyzed and quantitatively measured in this paper. Topics are ranked by the combination of their media focus and user attention values online automatically. Related news stories of topics are provided fo r users X  quick access. Empirical evaluation on the topic ranking re sult indicates that the proposed topic ranking algorithm reflects th e influence of time, the media and users. 
The main contributions of this pa per are twofold: (1) we present the quantitative measure of th e inconsistency between media focus and user attention, which provides a basis for topic ranking and an experimental evidence to show that there is a gap between what the media provide and what users view. (2) To the best of our knowledge, it is the first a ttempt to synthesize both media focus and user attention into one algorithm for automatic online topic ranking. 
In the future, we hope to analyz e the topic trends in continuous time slots. We also plan to discov er more user behaviors that can be utilized for topic ranking.
