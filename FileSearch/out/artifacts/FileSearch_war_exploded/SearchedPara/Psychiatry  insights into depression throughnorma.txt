Depression is classically seen as following life events such as divorces and job losses. Longi tudinal studies, however, have revealed that a significant fraction of the stressors associated with depression do in fact follow MDD onset, and that they are likely due to maladaptive behaviors promin ent in MDD (Kendler et al., 1999). Clinically effective  X  X alking X  therapies for MDD such as co gnitive and dialectical behavior therapies (DeRubeis et al., 1999; Bortolotti et al., 2008; Gotlib and H ammen, 2002; Power, 2005) explicitly concentrate on altering patients X  maladaptive behaviors a nd decision making processes.
 offers powerful analytical tools. Control problems relate d to decision making are prevalent in a huge diversity of fields, ranging from ecology to economics, computer science and engineering. These fields have produced well-founded and thoroughly char acterized frameworks within which many issues in decision making can be framed. Here, we will fo cus on framing issues identified in psychiatric settings within a normative decision making fr amework.
 Its second major strength comes from its relationship to neu robiology, and particularly those neuro-modulatory systems which are powerfully affected by all maj or clinically effective pharmacothera-pies in psychiatry. The understanding of these systems has b enefited significantly from theoretical accounts of optimal control such as reinforcement learning (Montague et al., 1996; Kapur and Rem-ington, 1996; Smith et al., 1999; Yu and Dayan, 2005; Dayan an d Yu, 2006). Such accounts may be useful to identify in more specific terms the roles of the neur omodulators in psychiatry (Smith et al., 2004; Williams and Dayan, 2005; Moutoussis et al., 2008; Day an and Huys, 2008). Figure 1: The learned helplessness (LH) paradigm. Three set s of rats are used in a sequence of two tasks. In the first task, rats are exposed to escapable or i nescapable shocks. Shocks come on at random times. The master rat is given escapable shocks: it ca n switch off the shock by performing an action, usually turning a wheel mounted in front of it. The yoked rat is exposed to precisely the same shocks as the master rat, i.e its shocks are terminated w hen the master rat terminates the shock. Thus its shocks are inescapable, there is nothing it can do it self to terminate them. A third set of rats is not exposed to shocks. Then, all three sets of rats are expo sed to a shuttlebox escape task. Shocks again come on at random times, and rats have to shuttle to the o ther side of the box to terminate the shock. Only yoked rats fail to acquire the escape respons e. Yoked rats generally fail to acquire a wide variety of instrumental behaviours, either determin ed by reward or, as here, by punishment contingencies.
 This paper represents an initial attempt at validating this approach experimentally. We will frame core notions of MDD in a reinforcement learning framework an d use it to design behavioral decision making experiments. More specifically, we will concentrate on two concepts central to current thinking about MDD: anhedonia and learned helplessness (LH , Maier and Seligman 1976; Maier and Watkins 2005). We formulate helplessness parametrical ly as prior beliefs on aspects of decision trees, and anhedonia as the effective reward size. This allo ws us to use choice behavior to infer the degree to which subjects X  behavioral choices are character ized by either of these. For validation, we correlate the parameters inferred from subjects X  behavi or with standard, questionnaire-based measures of hopelessness and anhedonia, and finally use the i nferred parameters alone to attempt to recover the diagnostic classification. The basic LH paradigm is explained in figure 1. Its importance is manifold: the effect of inescapable shock on subsequent learning is sensitive to most classes of clinically effective antidepressants; it has arguably been a motivation framework for the developmen t of the main talking therapies for depression (cognitive behavioural therapy, Williams (199 2), it has motivated the development of further, yet more specific animal models (Willner, 1997), an d it has been the basis of very specific research into the cognitive basis of depression (Peterson e t al., 1993).
 Behavioral control is the central concept in LH: yoked and ma ster rat do not differ in terms of the amount of shock (stress) they have experienced, only in term s of the behavioural control over it. It is not a standard notion in reinforcement learning, and ther e are several ways one could translate the concept into RL terms. At a simple level, there is intuiti vely more behavioural control if, when repeating one action, the same outcome occurs again and agai n, than if this were not true. Thus, at a very first level, control might be related to the outcome entr opy of actions (see Maier and Seligman 1976 for an early formulation). Of course, this is too simple . If all available actions deterministically led to the same outcome, the agent has very little control. Fi nally, if one were able to achieve all outcomes except for the one one cares about (in the rats X  case switching off or avoiding the shock), we would again not say that there is much control (see Huys (20 07); Huys and Dayan (2007) for a more detailed discussion). Despite its obvious limitation s, we will here concentrate on the simplest notion for reasons of mathematical expediency. Figure 2: Effect of  X  on predictions, Q -values and exploration behaviour. Assume a slot machine (blue) has been chosen five times, with possible rewards 1-5, and that reward 2 has been obtained twice, and reward 4 three times (inset in left panel). Left : Predictive distribution for a prior with negative  X  (low control) in light gray, and large  X  (extensive control) in dark gray. We see that, if the agent believes he has much control (and outcome distribu tions have low entropy), the predictive distribution puts all mass on the observations. Right : Assume now the agent gets up to 5 more pulls (tree depth 1-5) between the blue slot machine and a new, oran ge slot machine. The orange slot machine X  X  predictive distribution is flat as it has never bee n tried, and its expected value is therefore 3. The plot shows the difference between the values for the tw o slot machines. First consider the agent only has one more pull to take. In this case, independen tly of the priors about control, the agent will choose the blue machine, because it is just slight ly better than average. Note though that the difference is more pronounced if the agent has a high cont rol prior. But things change if the agent has two or more choices. Now, it is worth trying out the new mac hine if the agent has a high-control prior. For in that case, if the new machine turns out to yield a large reward on the first try, it is likely to do so again for the second and subsequent times. Thus, the p rior about control determines the exploration bonus.
 The second central concept in current conceptions of MDD is t hat of reward sensitivity. Anhedonia, an inability to enjoy previously enjoyable things, is one of two symptoms necessary for the diagnosis of depression (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). A number of tasks in the literature have attempted to measure reward sensitivity behaviourally. Whi le these generally concur in finding decreased reward sensitivity in subjects with MDD, these re sults need further clarification. Some studies show interactions between reward and punishment se nsitivities with respect to MDD, but important aspects of the tasks are not clearly understood. F or instance, Henriques et al. (1994); Henriques and Davidson (2000) show decreased resonsivenes s of MDD subjects to rewards, but equally show decreased resonsiveness of healthy subjects t o punishments. Pizzagalli et al. (2005) introduced an asymmetrically rewarded perceptual discrim ination task and show that the rate of change of the response bias is anticorrelated with subjects  X  anhedonic symptoms. Exactly how decreased reward responsivity can account for this is at pre ssent not clear.
 Great care has to be taken to disentangle these two concepts. Anhedonia and helplessness both provide good reasons for not taking an action: either becaus e the reinforcements associated with the action are insufficient (anhedonia), or because the outcome is not judged a likely result of taking some particular action (if actions are thought to have large outcome entropy). We consider a scenario where subjects have no knowledge of th e outcome distributions of actions, but rather learn about them. This means that their prior beli efs about the outcome distributions are not overwhelmed by the likelihood of observations, and may t hus have measurable effects on their action choices. In terms of RL, this means that agents do not k now the decision tree of the problem they face. Control is formulated as a prior distribution on t he outcome distributions, and thereby as a prior distribution on the decision trees.
 The concentration parameter  X  of a Dirichlet process can very simply parametrise entropy, and, if used as a prior, allow for very efficient updates of the pred ictive distributions of actions. Let us assume we have actions A which have as outcomes rewards R , and keep count N P a  X  A , where t is the number of times that action has been chosen, r t is the reward on the t th trial and  X  is the Kronecker delta. The predictive distribution for act ion a is then Here, B ( r ) is the base distribution, which we assume is flat, and N number of times action a was chosen up to trial t . Thus, the first time an action is chosen, we draw a sample from B ( r ) . For  X  = 0 , we then always draw that very same sample again. For  X  =  X  , we keep drawing from the same flat outcome distribution. Thus,  X  very simply determines the entropy of the actions X  outcome distribution. To match parametric v alues onto control more intuitively, let  X  =  X  log(  X  ) be the control parameter.
 The action choice problem is now to choose action a = argmax defined by the Bellman equation of our problem: where N values is illustrated in Figure 2. One can now infer the maxim um likelihood (ML) parameters of the prior by writing the probability of the subject X  X  observed a ctions as a standard softmaxed version of the Q values: where we have introduced a second parameter  X  , which is either the softmax inverse temperature, or, alternatively and equivalently, the size of the rewards (the maximum of R and  X  are not both inferable from action observations only).
 Simulations of the inference revealed that the parameters  X  and  X  , our inferred reward sensitivity and prior on control, were correlated. To alleviate this proble m, subjects were additionally given a reward sensitivity task which was interleaved with the control tas k (see below for the task descriptions). The structure of the reward sensitivity task is such that Q values are correctly defined by a Rescorla-Wagner (RW) learning rule: where Q RW again defined via softmax with a parameter  X  as in equation 4. Note, importantly, i) that this is not dependent on  X  , the prior belief about control and ii) that unlike equation 2 above, this is a  X  X odel-free X  algorithm that does not look ahead and thus doe s not take anticipated rewards into account). Combining inference in the two tasks (sharing  X  between them), allows us to use the reward sensitivity task as a prior on  X  for the control task and to eliminate the correlation. 2.1 Task and subjects Subjects are told to imagine that they are in a large casino, a nd will be dropped randomly in each of 100 rooms. In each room, they will get to choose between slot m achines. At first, they see only one slot machine, which they have to choose. Next, they get to cho ose between two slot machines. A new machine is presented whenever all machines on the screen hav e been tried. Thus, the exploratory drive is always maintained with one unexplored slot machine . Subjects get 8 choices per room, and thus get to try a maximum of 8 machines once in each room. Subje cts are informed that outcomes for each slot machine are between 0 and 9 points. Overall, sub jects are thus always kept in the dark about the true outcome distribution of any one slot mach ine. Thus, their prior beliefs become relevant. For healthy control subjects, one room was chosen randomly and the total number of points Figure 3: Repeat modulation. Bottom plots: Probability of c hoosing a slot machine again given that it has just yielded a particular outcome. Control subjects a re in gray and MDD subjects in red (all individuals as dots, means  X  1 std. err. as bars; red dots on the right of bars, gray dots on t he left of bars). Top plots: uncorrected p-values comparing the two gr oups for every individual outcome. Left panel: after observing a particular outcome once, Right pan el: after observing the same outcome on a particular machine twice in a row. The p-values at the top indicate the ANOVA interaction of outcome size with group. Thus, we see here that subjects with MDD are more likely to stick with a bad machine, and more likely to move away from a good machine . The same result is observed when fitting sigmoids to each subject and comparing the infer red parameters (data not shown). earned in that room determined the payment (1 point = 1 US$, mi nimum 10US$, maximum 50US$). MDD subjects were given the same instructions, but, for ethi cal reasons, could not be paid. Reward sensitivity task: Subjects chose repeatedly (300 times) between two stacks of cards with probabilistic binary outcomes. The underlying probabilit ies of a reward changed as a (squashed) Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This task was thus accurately described by a standard Rescorla-Wagner (RW) rule (Daw et al., 2006).
 Questionnaire measures: Finally, each subject filled out two questionnaires: the Bec k Helplessness Score (BHS), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) which a re standard questionnaire measures of hopelessness and anhedonia respectively. We extracted t he anhedonic subcomponent, BDIa, as the sum of responses on questions 4, 12, 15 and 21 of the BDI.
 Subjects: We recruited 17 healthy control subjects from the community . 15 subjects with MDD were recruited as part of an ongoing treatment study, and ask ed to take the behavioural test while waiting to see the psychiatrists. All subjects were given a f ull Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (First et al., 2002a,b). All MDD subjects met criteria for a current major depressive episode. Three subjects had additionally a diagnosis of either Panic Disorder (2) or Bipolar Disorder II (1). All the healthy control subjects had neither a present psych iatric disorder, nor a history thereof. All procedures were approved by the New York State Institue of Ps ychiatry Institutional Review Board. The subjects were matched for sex and educational level, but not for age. We thus included age in our model formulations to exclude its effects as a nuisanc e variable. The depressed sample was older, but throughout, the effects of age correlate negatively with those of depression. 3.1 Reward sensitivity Preliminary analysis: Repeat modulation, a very simple proxy measure of choices, p rovides a first glimpse at the effects of depression on the first task. Figure 3 shows the probability with which subjects chose a slot machine again after having received ou tcomes 0-9. As groups, MDD subjects both avoid bad and exploit good machines less. Nearly half th e subjects with MDD show very little modulation with rewards. As a group, MDD subjects appear les s sensitive to the reward structure in the first task. Reward sensitivity: The main hypothesis with respect to reward sensitivity is th at subjects X  empir-ically observed reward sensitivity  X  in equation 5 is inversely related to their expressed anhedo nia, BDIa, in the questionnaires. We can build this into the actio n choice model by parametrising  X  in the Q RW value (equation 5) above explicitly as a function of the ques tionnaire anhedonia score BDIa : If the hypothesis is true and subjects with higher BDIa score s do indeed care less about rewards, we should observe that  X  variable in our subject sample. Furthermore, if it is true th at anhedonia, as expressed by the ques-tionnaire, relates to reward sensitivity specifically, we s hould be able to write a similar regression for the learning rate  X  (from equation 5) but find that  X  interest (emphasized in blue in the equations) and confirms t hat people who express higher levels of anhedonia do indeed show less reward sensitivity, but do n ot differ in terms of learning rate. If it were the case that subjects with higher BDIa score were jus t less attentive to the task, one might also expect an effect of BDIa on learning rate. 3.2 Control Validation: The control task is new, and we first need to ascertain that sub jects were indeed sensitive to main features of the task. We thus fit both a RW-learning rul e (as in the previous section, but adjusted for the varying number of available actions), and t he full control model. Importantly, both these models have two parameters, but only the full control m odel has a notion of outcome entropy, and evaluations a tree. The chance probability of subjects X  actions was 0.37, meaning that, on average, there were just under three machines on the screen. The probability of the actions under the RW-learning rule was better at 0.48, and that of the full c ontrol model 0.54. These differences are highly significant as the total number of choices is 29600 . Thus, we conclude that subjects were indeed sensitive to the manipulation of outcome entropy, an d that they did look ahead in a tree. Prior belief about control: Applying the procedure from the previous task to the main tas k, we write the main parameters of equations 2 and 4 as functions of the questionnaire measures and infer linear parameters: Importantly, because the BDIa scores and the BHS scores are c orrelated in our sample (they tend to be large for the subjects with MDD), we include the cross-ter ms (  X  in the specific effects of BDIa on  X  , as before, and of BHS on  X  . We here infer and display two separate values  X  in the first and the second half of the experiment. In fact, to p arallel the LH experiments better, the slot machines in the first 50 rooms were actually very noisy (l ow true  X  ), which means that subjects were here exposed to low levels of control just like the yoked rats in the original experiment. In the second half of the experiment on the other hand, slot machine s tended to be quite reliable (high true  X  ).
 Figure 5 shows again the ML values for the parameters of inter est (emphasized in blue in the equa-tions). Again, we find that our parameter estimate are very si gnificantly different from zero ( &gt; three standard deviations).
 The effect of the BHS score on the prior beliefs about control  X  is much stronger in the second half than of the experiment in the first half, i.e. the effect of BHS on the prior belief about control is particularly prominent when subjects are in a high-control environment and have previously been exposed to a low-control environment. This is an interestin g parallel to the learned helplessness experiments in animals. 3.3 Classification Finally we combine the two tasks. We integrate out the learni ng rate  X  , which we had found not be related to the questionnaire measures (c.f. figure 4), and us e the distribution over  X  from the first task as a prior distribution on  X  for the second task. We also put weak priors on  X  and infer both  X  and  X  for the second task on a subject-by-subject basis. Figure 6 s hows the posterior values for  X  and  X  for MDD and healthy subjects and the ability of a linear class ifier to classify them. In this paper, we have attempted to provide a specific formula tion of core psychiatric concepts in reinforcement learning terms, i.e. hopelessness as a prior belief about controllability, and anhedonia as reward sensitivity. We have briefly explained how we expec t these formulations to have effect in a behavioural situation, have presented a behavioral tas k explicitly designed to be sensitive to our formulations, and shown that people X  X  verbal expressio n of hopelessness and anhedonia do have specific behavioral impacts. Subjects who express anhedoni a display insensitivity to rewards and those expressing hopelessness behave as if they had prior be liefs that outcome distributions of ac-tions (slot machines) are very broad. Finally, we have shown that these purely behavioural measures are also predictive of their psychiatric status, in that we w ere able to classify patients and healthy controls purely on the basis of performance.
 Several aspects of this work are novel. There have been previ ous attempts to map aspects of psy-chiatric dysfunction onto specific parametrizations (Cohe n et al., 1996; Smith et al., 2004; Williams and Dayan, 2005; Moutoussis et al., 2008), but we believe tha t our work represents the first attempt to a) apply it to MDD; b) make formal predictions about subjec t behavior c) present strong evi-dence linking anhedonia specifically to reward insensitivi ty across two tasks d) combine tasks to tease helplessness and anhedonia apart and e) to use the beha vioral inferences for classification. The latter point is particularly important, as it will determin e any potential clinical significance (Veiel, 1997). In the future, rather than cross-validating with res pect to say DSM-IV criteria, it may also be important to validate measures such as ours in their own righ t in longitudinal studies. Several important caveats do remain. First, the population s are not fully matched for age. We in-cluded age as an additional regressor and found all results t o be robust. Secondly, only the healthy subjects were remunerated. However, repeating the analyse s presented using only the MDD subjects yields the same results (data not shown). Thirdly, we have no t yet fully mirrored the LH experiments. We have so far only tested the transfer from a low-control env ironment to a high-control environ-ment. To make statements like those in animal learned helplessness experiments, the transfer from high-control to low-control environments will need to be ex amined, too. Fourth, the notion of con-trol we have used is very simple, and more complex notions sho uld certainly be tested (see Dayan and Huys 2008). Fifth, and maybe most importantly, we have so far only attempted to classify MDD and healthy subjects, and can thus not yet make any statement s about the specificity of these ef-fects with respect to MDD. Finally, it will be important to re plicate these results independently, and possibly in a different modality. Nevertheless, we believe these results to be very encouraging.
