 The prevalence of photo capture devices, together with the advent of media-sharing services like Flickr TM , have led to voluminous digital photos with text tags, timestamps, and geographical references on the Internet. In the era of Web 2.0, the text description and geo-references of photos are mostly socially generated and collaboratively contribute d by Web communities. Different from other online media, the geotagged 1 photos connect geography, time, and visual information together and provide an unprecedented wealth of data to accomplish geographic-related multimedia and vision tasks that were unattainable in the past.

In this study, we focus on analyzing tourist mobility and travel behaviors based on geotagged photos. When people take photos at a geographic location, the photos become digital footprints marking their physical presence [Girardin 2008]. The time/ geo-references associated with a sequence of photos then manifest the spatiotempo-ral movements of the photo taker. Figure 1 shows the travel paths generated from geotagged photos in London plotted on Google Earth. As shown, in spite of noise, the travel paths from geotagged photos reveal much information about people X  X  travel behavior, spatial movement patterns, tourist density, and their common travel trajec-tories. Understanding these mobility patterns can be tremendously useful to many mobile and location based social and multimedia applications, such as tour guide and recommendation systems.

A variety of methods are available for acquiring people X  X  travel data, such as surveying people X  X  location histories [Lau 2007; Lew and McKercher 2002; McKercher and Lew 2004] and automatic location-sensing devices, like GPS [McKercher and Lau 2008; Zheng et al. 2009]. The cost, scalability, and privacy issues, however, hinder the effectiveness of these methods. In this article, we show that the community-contributed geotagged photos on the Intern et can tackle these issues and provide an efficacious solution to automatic tourist mobility analysis. Publicly available on the Internet, the geotagged photos make the acqu isition of travel itinerary data a trivial task. More importantly, the travel itinerary database can be easily augmented by downloading more photos, enabling tourist mobility analysis to scale up to a multitude of tour destinations.

To mine the travel patterns, we focus our analysis on two aspects: (1) tourist move-ment patterns in relation to the regions of attractions (RoA) within a local destination, and (2) topological characteristics of trav el routes by different tourists. The tourist movement patterns characterize the transition traffic among different RoAs, namely how tourist traffic flows within the local destination. The traffic analysis also helps to indicate the topological relation and connectivity among different RoAs. For example, two RoAs are coupled together, if the tourist traffic always flows from one to other. Similarly, a RoA is identified as a centric one if it has an influx of tourist traffic from many other RoAs. At other end of the spectrum, the topological characteristics of travel routes reflect the group patterns of tourist travel behavior. Specifically, it signifies the choice of the crowd on travel routes visiting different RoAs.

To perform these two travel analyses, several challenges need to be tackled. First, online photos are noisy, and thus, it is critical to build a statistically reliable data-base of travel paths from geotagged photos. Second, tourist movement is, in essence, a sequential event of visiting different places; and a proper model is required to ana-lyze such sequential data. Third, to investigate the topological characteristics of tour routes of different people, a robust similarity metric is needed to measure the simi-larity of different travel routes. To tackle the first issue, we build the tourist travel path database from geotagged photos, based on the concept of mobility entropy .The rational is simple: the mobile nature of sightseeing renders the photos of a true tourist to be spread over a large spatial extend within the tour destination. Then, a signif-icance test is applied to ensure that the resulting photo path is statistically reliable. Though outliers and noise might still exist, the tourist travel patterns are expected to be statistically significant when the number of travel paths is large.

To analyze the tourist traffic statistics, we formulate the movement of a tourist as a visit sequence of RoAs in the framework of the Markov chain model [Diaconis 2009]. The Markov chain model is widely used in various disciplines to analyze the trend of spatiotemporal movement and outcomes of sequential events [Ishikawa et al. 2004; Upton and Fingleton 1989]. Based on the first-order dependence in the Markov chain, we can estimate the statistics of visitors traveling from one region to another. To in-vestigate the topological characteristics of tour routes, we perform sequence clustering on travel routes, in which the modified longest common subsequence (LCSS) [Vlachos et al. 2003] is adopted as a similarity metric for better robustness to noise.
Overall, this study proposes to leverage the community-contributed geotagged pho-tos to mine the tourist travel patterns within a local destination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that substantiates the tourist mobility analysis based on geotagged photos. The main contributions are as follows.  X  We propose a statistical approach for building a real-life tourist movement trajec-tory database from geotagged photos.  X  We develop a scheme for analyzing two aspects of tourist travel patterns: (1) tourist movement patterns in relation to RoAs, and (2) the topological characteristics of travel routes.
 We demonstrate the proposed scheme on four major cities: Paris, London, San Fran-cisco, and New York City. Experiments show that the proposed approach can deliver promising results. The rest of the article is organized as follows. We first review related literature work in Section 2 and elaborate on the details of the proposed approach in Section 3. Sections 4 and 5 presents the experiments. Finally, Section 6 gives the conclusive remarks along with discursion of future work. In recent years, the advent of media-sharing services, such as Flickr TM and Youtube TM , has led to a vast amount of community-contributed photos and videos available on the Internet [Zha et al. 2010]. Together with socially generated textual and spatiotemporal metadata, these enriched multimedia data have spurred much research on discovering knowledge and patterns of our human society. Crandall et al. [2009] first investigate ways to organize a large collection (  X  35 million) of geotagged photos and predict locations of photos from visual, textual, and temporal features. Kalogerakis et al. [2009] attempted to estimate the geo-locations of a sequence of photos. Kennedy et al. [2007] proposed discovering aggregate knowledge of a geographical area by analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of tags of Flickr photos in the area. Similarly, Rattenbury et al. [2007] and Yanai et al. [2009] analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of photo tags to reveal the interrelation between word concepts (namely photo tags), geographical locations, and events. Li et al. [2008] and Zheng et al. [2009, 2009] learned the geographical and visual appearance knowledge of tourist landmarks from community-contributed photos on the Internet. Similarly, Li et al. [2009] explored ways to perform large-scale landmark image classification. The commonality between these works and our study is that they all aim to extract some knowledge and patterns from photos with textual and spatiotemporal metadata, while this study focuses on mining travel patterns of tourists. In this aspect, this study shares a similar vision with Kurashima et al. [2010] and Lu et al. [2010]. The major difference is, however, that this work builds a database of tourist itineraries out of noisy Internet photos, while the approaches in Kurashima et al. and Lu et al. assume that all geotagged photos pertain to tourists and that tourist itineraries are readily available. De Choudhury et al. [2010a, 2010c] also explored the construction of travel itineraries from geotagged photos. Itinerary is defined as the list of landmarks that a person visits, which is generated by mapping photo geospatial coordinates to the lati-tude/longitude of the given landmarks. In contrast, the itinerary in the proposed work is defined to be the spatiotemporal movement trajectory with much finer granularity.
The study on tourist travel pattern within a tour destination has been a popular geographic research topic. McKercher and Lau [2008] attempted to identify the move-ment patterns and styles of tourists within an urban destination.Asakura and Iryo [2007] investigated the topological characteristics of tourist behavior in a clustering approach. Lewa and McKerchera [2006] explored urban transportation and tourist behavior modeling to identify explanatory factors that influence tourist movements. Compared to these works, this study differs mainly in two aspects. First, the travel in-formation in the previous work is mainly acquired via a manual survey with a limited number of tourist respondents. Consequently, these studies covered only one or two tour destinations. In contrast, the proposed approach mines the travel information from Internet photos, which renders the data acquisition highly efficient, and thus, al-lows the travel analysis to easily scale up to a multitude of destinations. Second, this study analyzes both traffic flow pattern and topological characteristics of travel routes, while most existing work focuses on traffic pattern only.

The proposed system is also closely related to tour route recommendation systems [Asakura and Iryo 2007; De Choudhury et al. 2010b; Lewa and McKerchera 2006; Zheng and Xie 2011]. Choudhury et al. proposed a system for constructing intracity travel itineraries for vacation planning. Elias and Sester [2006] attempted to recom-mend a navigation route that traverses along a set of tourist landmarks with minimal complexity of route description, while Zhang et al. [2008] focused on searching tourist routes to visit a few tourist attractions with the shortest traveling distance. Simi-larly, Kawai et al. [2009] developed a personalized tour recommendation system to visit tourist sights around a tour destination.

Characterized by spatiality and temporality, tourist movement trajectory can be regarded as one kind of spatiotemporal data, which connects this study to the spa-tiotemporal data mining in the Knowledg e Discovery in Databases (KDD) community. Peng and Chen [2003] attempted to mine the movement patterns of a mobile user and devised a data allocation method in a mobile computing environment. Verhein and Chawla [2008] discovered the spatiotemporal association rules that described how mobile objects move between regions over time. Giannotti et al. [2007] proposed to represent movement trajectory pattern in terms of  X  X egion of interest X , with which as-pect our approach shares a similar vision. Nevertheless, contrary to these works, the proposed approach focuses on delivering a tourist travel behavior analytic mechanism that can be readily applied to multitude of tour destinations.

This work is based on and extends our previous work [Zheng et al. 2011] which focuses merely on analyzing tourist movement patterns in relation to RoAs. This work is an extension in the following aspects. First, besides the travel patterns among RoAs, it investigates the topological characteristics of travel routes. To do so, a sequencing clustering method is developed. Popular tour routes, relax trips, and busy trips are also analyzed. Second, it explores two different methods for validating the statistical significance of tourist photo paths which are based on the Poisson and normal distrib-utions, respectively. Given a set of geotagged photos P = { p } in a tour destination, we first build the data-unique photo ID  X  p , tagged GPS coordinates  X  p in terms of latitude and longitude, timestamp t p of when the photo was taken, photographer/uploader ID u p , and tagged text p . Here, the tourist travel movement is modeled on a daily basis. In accordance with the photographer ID u p , we organize the photos of each photographer taken in a day in a chronical sequence &lt; p 0 , ..., p k &gt; . By representing the geographical calibra-tion  X  p of photo p in ordinary Cartesian coordinates ( x p , y p ), we define a photo trail as the movement of a photographer (in the notation of [Giannotti et al. 2007]), as follows.
Definition 1. The photo trail of a traveler corresponds to a spatiotemporal sequence and ( x k , y k )  X  R 2 .

Based on the preceding definition, we construct the photo trail of a photogra-pher/uploader by concatenating photos in the order of their timestamp on a daily ba-sis. We then classify these spatiotemporal sequences to tourist and non-tourist travel paths. The premise for classification is that the mobile nature of sightseeing renders the photos of a true tourist to be spread over a large spatial extend within the tour, as shown in Figure 2.

Entropy-Based Mobility Measure. In a probabilistic perspective, the mobility complexity leads to a geospatial distribution of photos with reasonably high entropy. We, there-fore, exploit this mobility entropy to discriminate the tourist and non-tourist movement trajectories, by utilizing the concept of Shannon entropy in Information Theory. Let p ( x , y ) denote the geospatial density of photos with geospatial coordinates ( x , y )per-taining to the photographer/uploader. The mobility entropy H mob ( S ) of a movement trajectory S = &lt; ( x 0 , y 0 , t 0 ) , ..., ( x k , y k , t k ) &gt; is computed as where p ij ( x , y ) is a discrete geospatial distribution of photos in grid ( i , j ). By partition-ing the tour destination into n  X  m grids 2 , p ij ( x , y ) is estimated by the counts of photos in grid ( i , j ). To discriminate photo trails, we empirically set mobility entropy thresh-old  X  mob .Thephototrail S is then classified as a tourist one if H mob ( S )  X   X  mob .  X  mob is empirically set to 0.2 in our experiments.

Statistical Significance of Travel Paths. We need to ensure that the resulting travel path database is statistically reliable. To do so, we perform statistical significance test on the resulting photo trails. Here, we characterize the photo trajectory of a pho-tographer/uploader with the number k of his/her visited places. To some extent, the number of visited places indicates the mobility complexity of tourist. The number of visited places is determined by the number of photos with unique geospatial coordi-nates. Geospatial coordinates within a small distance (30m in experiments) will be considered as one. We devise two methods to validate the statistical significance of discovered travel paths.

Method 1. If we model the number of places to visit ( k ) in a tourist itinerary as the number of events occurring in a fixed interval, k will effectively become a Poisson random variable which can be modeled by the Poisson distribution.
 where  X  is equal to the expected number (mean) of visited places. In probability the-ory and statistics, the Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval. In the setting of this work, the number of events corresponds to the number of places to visit in a tour itinerary. The validity of using the Poisson distribution depends on the assumption that the number of places to visit k in a tour is randomly distributed. In other words, individual tour itinerary samples should be independent from each other. This independence assumption is reasonable in that a tour itinerary depends on many factors, including a tourists personal preference, his/her prior visits, total tour duration, tour destination demography, etc.

With the Poisson model, we apply the statistical significance test on photo itinerary k . Here, we set the level of significance at 5%. In this Poisson experiment, a photo trajectory of k visited places might be generated by (1) a normal tour or (2) by some sort of noise (such as camera clock, GPS error, etc). The probability of the photo itineracy happening by chance of noise must be less than the level of significance. To do so, we discard photo itinerary k whose Poisson probability P ( k ;  X  ) is less than the level of significance of 5%. In other words, we disca rd photo itineraries that visit too few or too many places. The reason for discarding itineraries with too many placed is that itineraries that move fast are highly likely to be the results of camera clock and GPS noises.
Method 2. As the number of photo trajectory samples is relatively large, we can also approximate the tourist itinerary in terms of the number of places k with normal dis-tribution N (  X  k , X  k ) [Degroot and Schervish 2001]. The mean  X  k and standard devia-tion  X  k are estimated from the trajectory samples. Similar to Method 1, this normal model of tourist itinerary implicitly assumes that individual tour itinerary samples are independent from each other.

With the normal model, we apply a z-test to evaluate the statistical significance of a photo trajectory k . The null hypothesis H 0 in the test is defined as where H 0 states that the itinerary k generated from geotagged photos is statically significant, rather than generated from noisy photos by chance. The z-score z is then computed as where n is the number of photo itinerary samples. By looking up the z-score in a ta-ble of the standard normal distribution, the corresponding p-value can be obtained. A lower p-value indicates a lower probability that the null hypothesis H 0 holds. If the p-value is less than a threshold  X  , the null hypothesis H 0 is rejected, and the photo itinerary is deemed statistically insignificant or unreliable and discarded subse-quently. As with Method 1, we set the level of significance  X  at 5%. 3.1.1. Discovering Regions-of-Attractions (RoA). As our focus is on tourist mobility analy-sis at a macrolevel, a comprehensive list of regions of attractions within a tour desti-nation is needed. Here, we define the region of attraction (RoA) as follows.
Definition 2. A region of attraction r is a spatial extent in the geographical feature space of Cartesian coordinates ( x , y ), where a considerable number of tourist move-ment trajectories pass through. RoA can be modeled as a spatial neighborhood func-tion F ( x i , y i ): R 2  X  X  0 , 1 } .
 In the spirit of our previous work [Zheng et al. 2009], we develop a density-based model to discover regions of attractions by analyzing the geospatial distribution of geotagged photos. As stated in Definition 2, a region of attractions is a communal and interpretable spatial concept shared by a multitude of people. In other words, a RoA corresponds to a spatial extent that many tourists visit and photograph. Clustering on geotagged photos then becomes an intuitive solution four discovering the list of regions of attraction.

Here, we adopt the DBSCAN algorithm [Ester et al. 1996] to perform the geospatial clusting on geotagged photos for the following reasons. First, DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm. Intuitively, it tends to identify regions of dense data points as clusters. This density-driven approach fits our task well, as the high density of photos implicates the popular appeal of the region. Second, the DBSCAN algorithm supports clusters with arbitrary shapes. T hisiscriticaltoourtask,asshapesofRoA can be spherical, linear, elongated, etc. Third, DBSCAN is demonstrated to have good efficiency on large-scale data. (cf. Ester et al. [1996] for more details of DBSCAN.)
After obtaining clusters of photos, we then determine the name and spatial extent of RoA by examining the GPS coordinates and text titles of component photos. We compute the frequency of n-grams of all photos text titles in each cluster. The name of the RoA is determined to be the photo title with the highest frequency. The geospatial extent of RoA is the area defined by the GPS coordinates of its member photos. Similar to the work in Zheng et al. [2009], the resulting RoA is validated by the number of unique photographers/uploaders. This is to further ensure the popular appeal of the RoA. Based on the concept of RoA, we define the transition statistics between RoAs.
Definition 3. The transition statistics between RoAs depicts how tourist traffic flows from one RoA to another. It is defined as transition probabilities among different RoAs. By defining tourist travel as a sequence of RoAs, we investigate how tourists move from one RoA to another using the Markov chain model, in the spirit of Xia et al. [2009].

Here, we like to point out that the travel path is the actual moving trajectory of a tourist, which is represented by a set of photos with timestamps and GPS coordinates. An RoA (region of attraction) is a region where many tourists visit (and take photos). Different from a travel path, a travel route consists of a sequence of RoAs.
From a statistical perspective, we model the movement of a tourist as an indepen-dent stochastic random process. The state space of the stochastic process is the set of RoA { r } in the tour destination. Let T = { 0 , 1 , 2 , ... } denote the time index of the moves of a stochastic process. The stochastic process representing tourist movement { R t } t  X  T is referred to as a Markov chain (MC) if the value of the next state does not depend on any previous states given the value of current state.
 where R t is the random variable of RoA, r t is a value of R t ,and r t  X  X  r } .IntheMarkov chain model, each move in the state space { r } is called a step . As each movement occurs after one unit time step, the stochastic process of tourist movement is modeled by a stationary discrete Markov chain. The transition probability P ( r j | r i )fromRoA r i to r j can then be estimated by counting the tourists moving from RoA r i to r j . Accordingly, the RoA transition can be represented by a directed graph G =( V , E )inwhichvertex V corresponds to RoA, and edge E represents the transition statistics. To investigate the topological characteristi cs of travel routes by different tourists, we define the travel route.

Definition 4. The travel route is the traveling course of a tourist which is constituted m is the length of the tour route. The cardinality | R | of a tour route is the number of RoAs visited in the route.
 Topological analysis of travel routes is a task of group pattern mining on tourist mo-bility behavior. Clustering is an intuitive solution. However, a travel route is a visit chain of different RoAs, and a principled metric is needed to estimate the similarity of the two sequences. This metric needs to be robust to noise, as similar travel routes can always have slight differences, as shown in Figure 3.

To derive the sequence similarity metric for clustering, we exploit the modified longest common subsequence (LCSS) [Vlachos et al. 2003]. The main idea here is that the matching of two routes allows some elements (RoA) to be unmatched within a minimum bounding envelope , but the order of elements in the match must re-main. In other words, two tourist movement trajectories R x = &lt; r x R of R x that can be mapped to a long subsequence R y of R y . R x (or R y ) here does not necessarily consist of consecutive elements from R x (or R y ), but the elements in R x (or R y ) must be in the same order as in R x (or R y ) [Das et al. 1997]. Moreover, the mini-mum bounding envelope allows for some noise and outliers in the tour route matching. The similarity of tourist movement R x and R y is then defined as where | R x | = | R y | is the cardinality of the longest common subsequence. The procedure of estimating the similarity of two travel routes is summarized in Algorithm 1. The algorithm can be implemented efficiently via dynamic programming.

After computing the pair-wise similarity of tourist travel routes, we utilize hierar-chical agglomerative clustering to discover groups of similar movement trajectories. We use average link intercluster distance to define the distance of two subclusters, which measures the distance between one cluster and another cluster to be equal to the average distance from any member of one cluster to any data of the other cluster [Bishop 2006]. Each resulting cluster is regarded as one potential tour route pattern. Specifically, we define the tour route pattern G next.

Definition 5. A tour route pattern G refers to a group of tour paths that are topolog-ically similar in terms of the visit sequences of RoAs.
 The confidence score of a tour route pattern G is estimated by its cluster size and density, specifically as where  X  is a trade-off factor for the number of tour routes, and their similarity.  X  is set to 0.5 empirically in this study. Intuitively, tour patterns with high confidence scores will represent popular tour routes, as its large number of similar travel routes reflects the choice of the tourist crowd. Geotagged photos used in this study were downloaded from Flickr by using its publicly available API. To download photos, the name of a tour destination, such as Paris, London, etc, is fed-in as a query to retrieve a set of seed photos. Then, the IDs of the owners of these seed photos are retrieved. Based on the owners ID, we download the entire collection of his/her shared photos to ensure the completeness of the generated photo movement trajectory. We download photos in four major cities: London, Paris, New York City, and San Fran-cisco. In total, we collected  X  769K geotagged photos from  X  23K Flickr users. We concatenate photos of a photographer into photo trails on a daily basis. We then apply the entropy-based mobility measure to filter out photo trails from non-tourists. The mobility entropy threshold  X  mob classifies a photo trail into tourist or non-tourist. The value of  X  mob is determined empirically in a set of experiments. First, we manually labeled a set of photo paths as the ground truth. We display photos pertaining to a travel path and manually decide whether it is tourist or non-tourist based on the vi-sual content of tourism and sightseeing activities. For ambiguous photos, we simply regard them as non-tourist photos. As manual annotation is laborious, we only label 1,000 photo paths, of which 446 are tourist and 554 are not. Then we compute the mobility entropy of each photo trail and use the mobility entropy threshold to classify them into tourist and non-tourist trails. We change the threshold value from 0 to 0.5 to evaluate the parameter sensitivity over the classification accuracy. We observe that when  X  mob  X  0.3, its sensitivity on accuracy is not obvious. However, when  X  mob  X 0.3, the accuracy drops drastically. This is because the higher threshold misclassified many tourist photo paths as non-tourist ones. Based on the experiments, we set  X  mob to 0.2. Furthermore, the significance test is carried out to ensure the movement trajectories from photo trails to be statistically significant.

Method 1 based on Poisson distribution identifies 8,105 person-day travel paths taken by 5,032 tourists in total, while Method 2 based on normal distribution discov-ered 8,047 person-day trips taken by 5,010 tourists in total. To evaluate these two methods, we manually label a set of photo paths as the ground truth. We display the photos pertaining to a travel path and manually decide whether it is tourist or non-tourist based on the photos X  visual contents of tourism and sightseeing activities. For ambiguous photos, we simply regard them as non-tourist. As manual annotation is laborious, we sample a subset of 1,000 travel paths for labeling. Based on the Table of Sample Size [Krejcie 1970], the evaluation of 1,000 travel paths can estimate the accu-racy of the total travel paths with a confidence interval of 3% and a confidence degree of 95%. Among the 1,000 travel paths, 954 (or 95.4%) of them identified by Method 1 and 966 (or 96.6%) of them identified by Method 2 are found with obvious tourism and sightseeing characteristics in photos. This means that we have 95% confidence to state that Methods 1 and 2 can give an accuracy of 95.4% and 96.6%, respectively, within the range of  X  3%. This demonstrates that the proposed mobility entropy-based method is effective in identifying tourist travel paths. Observation shows that Meth-ods 1 and 2 yield very similar results. This is because, effectively, both methods try to filter out photo paths with too few or many visiting places. Some negative photo paths are examined. We observe that photos of these travel paths are geospatially scattered; however, little or no information can be perceived on touristic attractions and sightseeing activities.

As Method 2 gives slightly better results, we will adopt its resulting movement tra-jectory database for the subsequent process, which consists of 8,047 person-day trips taken by 5,010 tourists in total. On average, each city has  X  2,000 person-day trips. This significantly outnumbers the manually collected tourist movement datasets of ex-isting tourist mobility analysis works [Lau 2007; Lew and McKercher 2002; McKercher and Lew 2004], not to mention that the database can be easily augmented by down-loading more geotagged photos. Figures 1 and 4 3 show the movement trajectories generated from geotagged photos in New York City, San Francisco, Paris, and London plotted on Google Earth. By taking geotagged photos as input, we discover the regions of attractions (RoAs) in a density-based approach, as presented in Section 3.1. In total, we discover 80 RoAs, with 18 in London, 19 in Paris, 23 in New York City, and 20 in San Francisco. Among them, only 1 out of 80 RoAs is false: the San Francisco Pride Parade. This event is misclassified as an RoA as it gives rise to voluminous photos with strong geospatial pattern. Figure 5 shows the RoAs in New York City and San Francisco.

For comparison purposes, we next apply mean-shift clustering to identify RoAs, which is the approach used by Kurashima et al. [2010] and Lu et al. [2010]. Com-pared to the DBSCAN clustering, the mean-shift method gives a quite similar list of RoAs. The mean-shift discovers a total of 84 RoAs in the four cities, of which 77 (or 97.4%) of the RoAs are identical to the ones found by DBSCAN. We attribute this to the fact that an RoA is usually a dense cluster of photos, which can be reliably identified.
Popularity of RoA. The popularity of an RoA can be estimated by its tourist traffic volume X  X amely, the number of people that have taken photos in the region. Table I summarizes the top three most visited (most popular) RoAs in the four cities. For each RoA, the percentage of tourists that visit it is also computed. We compare Table I against the list of top three attractions in Yahoo!Travel 4 and found that two lists share 42% identical RoAs. The attraction popularity in Yahoo!Travel is estimated based on the feedback scores provided by Yahoo users. This overlap of popular RoAs suggests that despite different backgrounds, people tend to agree on the most popular attractions, to some extent. Figure 5 shows the popularity of RoAs in San Francisco and New York City. The height of the bar indicates the volume of tourist visits of the RoA.

Transition Traffic between RoAs. We utilize the Markov chain model to estimate the to another. A reasonably high value of P ( r j | r i ) suggests that RoA r j and r i are coupled in a way that tourists tend to visit RoA r j right after r i . Figure 6 displays the RoA transitions with probability P ( r j | r i ) &gt; 0 . 2 in downtown Paris. As shown, the coupled RoAs are usually geographically adjacent to each other. Moreover, it is also observed that people tend to prefer a certain direction when visiting two coupled RoAs. For ex-ample, the transition probability P (Eiffel Tower | Arc de Triomphe) that tourists move from the Arc de Triomphe to the Eiffel Tower is 0.31, while the transition probability P (Arc de Triomphe | Eiffel Tower) in the opposite direction is only 0.12. This suggests that tourists might share similar preferences in tour route planning. (For space limit reasons, the RoA transition in the other three cities are not illustrated.)
Centric RoA. Tourist traffic tends to flow from several RoAs to a central one. We denote this central RoA as centric RoA . Specifically, we define centric RoA as the RoA with transition probability P (centric RoA | r i ) &gt; 0 . 15 for more than three RoA r i . Table II summarizes the centric RoAs in the four cities. Figure 6 shows that the Eiffel Tower and the Cathedrale Notre Dame are centric RoAs in Paris, as they receive an influx of tourists from several adjacent RoAs. The centric RoA might be determined by several factors, including popularity, geog raphical location, tra nsportation conve-nience, etc. In a way, the centric RoA is the place where people congregate and meet each other.
 In our database of travel routes { R } in the four cities, the average cardinality of tour routes is | R | = 3.5. Namely, tourists visit an average of 3.5 RoAs per day. This number is similar to the average visit of 3.7 RoAs per day in the tourism study of McKercher and Lau [2008]. Table III summarizes the average number of RoA visits per day in the four cities.

Popular Tour Routes. We then perform sequence clustering as presented in Section 3.3 to discover popular tour routes based on the confidence score in Eq. (7). The clusters of travel routes with the highest scores tend to comprise many similar tour routes. We identify these clusters as group patterns of tourist travel routes. It reflects the crowds choice on popular tour routes. Specifically, we take the centroid route of the top three clusters as representative routes and list them in Table IV for the four cities. From Table IV, two observations draws our attention. First, different popular routes usually visit a distinct set of RoAs. Second, the popular tour routes mostly comprise of a small number (2 or 3) of RoAs. This observation motivates us to further investigate the number of RoAs in the routes.

Relax trips vs. Busy trips. Based on the number of visited RoAs in travel routes, the daily tourist trip can be classified into two types: busy trip and relax trip .Busytrip refers to one that covers RoAs more than | R | , while relax trip has RoA visits less than |
R | . Out of 8,038 day trips in total, 3,949 (49.1%) trips belong to busy trips, and 4,098 (50.9%) trips are relax trips. The number o f RoA visits in a day trip reflects, in a general sense, the activeness of tourist travel behavior. Tourists of busy trips tend to seek tour experiences of traveling many varied RoAs, while tourists of relax trips prefer to have relaxing journeys by visiting only a few places. Another observation is that the number of RoAs in a trip is not necessarily associated with its geospatial distance or temporal duration. A relax trip can have a long geospatial distance if it visits two RoAs far apart, while a busy trip may be short geospatially if it visits the RoAs that are close to each other in a downtown area. There do exist special cases where a tourist may have a hectic schedule in visiting a single large RoA, such as a museum.

After examining the tour routes of relax trips, we observe that 3,557 (90%) out of 3,949 relax trips share the same route with another trip. This suggests that relax trips tend to be homogenous and regular. We attribute the homogeneity of relax trips to two reasons. First, a relax trip has a lesser number of RoAs and, therefore, less variations of RoAs combinations. Second, when people take up a relax trip of only two or three RoAs, they tend to visit the most popular RoAs, as shown in Table IV. This preference further reduces the variation of relax trips.

As busy trips consist of more RoA visits, the travel itineraries of busy trips are fairly diverse. Among 3,949 tour itineraries in the dataset, only 512 (13%) of them are exactly the same as another. This suggests that tourist travel behaviors become miscellaneous when people visit many places. This heterogeneity is attributed to many factors, including traits of human nature: individuality, personal preferences, journey duration, topological characteristics of the tour destination, etc. Though people travel differently, they do not travel randomly. This is because, in general, tour itinerary is a result of the joint effect of sightseeing strategy, transportation convenience, topological relation of RoAs, etc. Cluster analysis of tour routes exhibits this deliberateness of tourist travel itineraries.

We observe that despite the diversity of tour routes, some groups of tourists do share similar routes, especially when they visit a similar group of RoAs. For example, Figure 7 shows examples of two groups of similar tour routes in San Francisco. The group of tour routes in Figure 7 (a) goes from the downtown (Chinatown/Ferry Build-ing) area to the Golden Gate Bridge, by Passing the Ghirardelli Square area. Similarly, Figure 8 depicts a group of similar tour routes in New York City. The direction of all the routes in this group is from the Grand Central Station/Empire State Building area to the Statute of Liberty area. Similar tour routes can be the result of several factors. First, the tourists in the same group may share similar sightseeing preferences, which makes their routing strategy alike. Second, such travel patterns might be a result of a topological relation X  X ransportation convenience among various RoAs. For example, tourists usually visit Ellis Island right after the Statute of Liberty on Liberty Island because there exists a convenient ferry service from Liberty Island to Ellis Island, and most tour packages includes both destinations. Understanding tourist travel behavior and mobility patterns is important to many mo-bile and location-based social and multimedia applications. In this study, we approach this task by exploiting the socially generated and community-contributed geotagged photos on the Internet. The photos, together with their time/geo-references, implicitly mark the spatiotemporal movement trajectories of their photographers. We demon-strate that the geotagged photos can provide an efficient, effective, and scalable solu-tion to automatic tourist mobility analysis. Specifically, we focus our analysis on two aspects: (1) tourist movement patterns in rel ation to the regions of attractions (RoA), and (2) topological characteristics of trav el routes by different tourists. We first built a statistically reliable tourist movement trajectory database from geotagged photos by utilizing an entropy-based mobility measure. A list of regions of attraction (RoA) in a tour destination is then built based on the frequency of tourist visits. We then investi-gated tourist traffic flow among different RoAs by exploiting the Markov chain model to interpret tourists traffic transition. Fina lly, tourist travel patterns were analyzed by performing a sequence clustering on tour routes. Testing on four major cities includ-ing San Francisco, New York City, Paris, and London demonstrated that the proposed approach can deliver promising results.

Several issues are worth further investigation. First, the personal information of photographers, such as nationality, age, ge nder, etc, can reflect the travel preferences of different communities. The challenge is, however, that only a small percentage of users share their personal information publicly. Second, based on the mined travel patterns and preferences, personalized travel guides can be recommended to cater to the needs of travelers of different background.
