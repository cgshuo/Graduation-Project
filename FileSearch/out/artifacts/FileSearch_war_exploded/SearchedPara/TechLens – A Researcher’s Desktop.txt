 Rapid and continuous growth of digital libraries, coupled with brisk advancements in technology, has driven users to seek tools and services that are not only customized to their specific needs, but are also helpful in keeping th em stay abreast with the latest developments in their field. TechLens is a recommender system that learns about its users through implicit feedback, builds correlations among them, and uses that information to generate recommendations that match the us er X  X  profile. It gives users control over which parts of their profile of known citations are used in forming recommendations for new articles. This demonstration is a prototype that showcases some of the tools and services that TechLens offers to the users of digital libraries. H.3.7 [Information Storage and Retrieval] Digital Libraries, Dissemination Keywords: Digital Libraries, Recommenders, resolvability TechLens project is exploring how to construct recommender systems to support researcher s in discovering and managing research literature. For a technical paper, TechLens regards the citations in the paper as the imp licit  X  X otes X  for that paper, and uses them to build a graph of citations between papers. In our prior work [1, 2], we demonstrat ed that citation graphs can be analyzed effectively to generate recommendations. For the past two years, our studies have focused on understanding the feasibility of users X  personal citation collections for developing recommender-based services for digital libraries. We are trying to understand (a) how resolvable they are, (b) how closely do they represent users X  profile, and (c) how much of a correlation exists between these collections. We found as much as 47% of citations in users personal collections are resolvable, i.e., they can be resolved to a unique identifier, a nd to their online sources [3]. We are still learning about how truly th ese collections represent users X  interests, and the extent of overlap between these collections. Scholars, researchers and students spend much of their time looking for the scientific literature they need, and sifting through it to find the information they want. As digital libraries continue to grow, and continue to offer more power to its users, so do the challenges of finding the useful information, and finding them effectively. TechLens brings th e tools of recommender systems to digital libraries to help researchers more efficiently find both the information they knew they were looking for and the information they did not know they were looking for. Some of the core features of TechLens that support th e users of digital libraries are: Supporting Individual Researcher  X  TechLens helps enhance an individual's personal collection of references through recommendations. It uses user X  X  pr ofile to continuously generate, (and update) recommendations which are presented to her whenever she visits the system. Users can also request for recommendations as and when they like. Supporting Researchers Group  X  TechLens allows users to build and manage teams , by including or excluding fellow users. It then uses the collection of the individual bibliographies of members of the team to offer recommendations that would serve the group tasks, such as papers for group discussions or group presentation. TechLens allows users to define their profile in terms of articles they have published and the co-authors they have published with. Based on the information provided by the user, TechLens creates (a)  X  X y Pub X  -list of publications authored or co-authored by the user, and (b)  X  X y Team X  -list of authors that user has collaborated with. Together, these two lists form the initial user profile. Figure 1 shows the TechLens home page with multiple configurable blocks, each block representing a feature. These blocks are: Tags  X  Most recent public tags created in TechLens Articles  X  Most recent articles added into TechLens Authors  X  Most recent authors added into TechLens Portfolios  X  Most recent shared portfolios (A portfolio is a folder that contains zero or more articles) Saved Searches  X  Most recent public searches Recommendations : Latest recommendations for the user from TechLens (these show up only if the user is logged on) Each block can be configured to display 0 to 9 items; 0 disables under the Personalize menu. These blocks can be placed anywhere on the home page using the drag and drop. Additionally, Personalize menu contains options for customizing TechLens, which are: Tags  X  To manage personal tags. Allows users to mark them Private or Public. Default is Public. Portfolios  X  To manage personal portfolios. Allows users to mark them shared or private. Default is private. Build Profile  X  Allows users to identif y themselves from the list of authors in the TechLens database. If the user does not exist in containing her collections. Saved Searches  X  To manage personal saved searches. Allows users to mark them private or public. Default is Public. Recommendations  X  To seek recommendations from TechLens. Allows users to specify which pa rticular portfolios to include. Personalize options are available only if the user is logged on. In case a user does not have any publications that define her profile, TechLens attempts to generate recommendations for the user using her Saved Searches, if available. Integrating User Task as Input -TechLens generates recommendations for users base d on their profile. However, navigating the system. We are working on tuning the system to integrate user tasks as inputs to the system so that the generated recommendations not only fit the user profile, but match her intended task too. Supporting Group Tasks  X  When generating recommendations for a group of researchers with dive rse interests, it is a constant challenge to build an efficient profile of the group. Do all members of the group weigh in equally? What metrics differentiate between the novice members and the experienced members of the same group? What if an experienced member of one group is a novice in another? Privacy Issues  X  In our recent focus group meetings with users of RefWorks -an online bibliogr aphy management tool, users expressed that the recommender system must inform, and seek their consent before it starts recommending citations from their personal collections. They would al so like to have an option to opt-out any time they want. TechLens attempts to preserve users X  privacy by removing all the identifying information from all the records, and is exploring diffe rent ways to ensuring users X  privacy. This research has been funded in part by a grant from the University of Minnesota Libraries, and in part by grant IIS-0534939 from the National Science Foundation. We also like to thank our colleagues in GroupLens Research and in the University Libraries for their assistance, and ACM and RefWorks for their cooperation. [1] S.M. McNee et al.
