 Collective classification approaches exploit the dependencies of a group of linked objects whose class labels are correlated and need to be predicted simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on studying the collective classification problem in heterogeneous networks, which involves multiple types of data objects interconnected by multiple types of links. In-tuitively, two objects are correlated if they are linked by many paths in the network. By considering di ff erent link-age paths in the network, one can capture the subtlety of di ff erent types of dependencies among objects. We intro-duce the concept of meta-path based dependencies among objects, where a meta path is a path consisting a certain sequence of linke types. We show that the quality of col-lective classification results strongly depends upon the meta paths used. To accommodate the large network size, a novel solution, called Hcc (meta-path based Heterogenous Collec-tive Classification), is developed to e ff ectively assign labels to a group of instances that are interconnected through dif-ferent meta-paths. The proposed Hcc model can capture di ff erent types of dependencies among objects with respect to di ff erent meta paths. Empirical studies on real-world net-works demonstrate that e ff ectiveness of the proposed meta path-based collective classification approach.
 H.2.8 [ Database Management ]: Database Applications-Data Mining Heterogeneous information networks, Meta path
Collective classification methods [6] aim at exploiting the label autocorrelation among a group of inter-connected in-stances and predict their class labels collectively, instead
Figure 1: A Heterogeneous Information Network of independently. The dependencies among the related in-stances should be considered explicitly during classification process. Most approaches in collective classification focus on exploiting the dependencies among interconnected ob-jects in homogeneous networks. However, many real-world applications are facing large scale heterogeneous information networks [5] with multiple types of objects inter-connected through multiple types links. These networks are multi-mode and multi-relational networks, which involves large amount of information. For example, Figure 1 involves a bibliographic network with five types of nodes (papers, au-thor, a ffi liations, conference and proceedings) and five types of links.

In this paper, we focus on studying the problem of collec-tive classification on one type of nodes within a heterogenous information network, e.g. ,classifyingthepapernodescol-lectively in Figure 1. Formally, the collective classification problem in heterogeneous information networks corresponds to predicting the labels of a group of related instances simul-taneously. If we consider collective classification and hetero-geneous information networks as a whole, the major research challenges can be summarized as follows:
Multi-Mode and Multi-Relational Data: One fun-damental problem in classifying heterogeneous information networks is that the network structure involves multiple types of nodes and multiple types of links. For example, in Figure 1, one paper node can be linked directly with di ff er-ent types of objects, such as authors, conference proceedings and other papers, through di ff erent types of links, such as citation , authoredBy , etc. Trivial application of conventional methods by ignoring the link types and node types can not fully exploit the structural information within a heteroge-neous information network. Table 1: Semantics of Meta Paths (Paper Nodes)
Heterogeneous Dependencies: Another problem is that objects in heterogeneous information networks can be linked indirectly through di ff erent types of relational paths. Each types of relational path corresponds to di ff erent types of indirect relationships between objects. For example, in Fig-ure 1, paper nodes can be linked with each other indirectly through multiple indirect relationships, such as, 1) the X  X aper-author-paper X  relation indicates relationships of two papers sharing same authors; 2) the X  X aper-author-institute-author-paper X  relation denotes relationship between papers that are published from the same institute. Heterogenous infor-mation networks can encode various complex relationships among di ff erent objects. Thus, ignoring or treating all rela-tions equally will loss information dependence information in a heterogeneous information network.

In this paper, we propose a novel solution, called Hcc (meta-path based Heterogenous Collective Classification), to e ff ectively assign class labels to one type of objects in the network. Di ff erent from conventional collective classifi-cation methods, the proposed Hcc model can exploit a large number of di ff erent types of dependencies among objects si-multaneously. We define meta path-based dependencies to capture di ff erent types of relationships among objects. By explicitly exploiting these dependencies, our Hcc method can e ff ectively exploit the complex relationships among ob-jects. Definition 1 . Heterogeneous Information Network : Aheterogeneousinformationnetwork[5]isaspecialkind of information network, which is represented as a directed graph G =( V , E ). V is the set of nodes, including t types of objects T 1 = { v 11 ,  X  X  X  ,v 1 n 1 } ,  X  X  X  , T t = { v E  X  V  X  V is the set of links between the nodes in V ,which involves multiple types of links.

Di ff erent from conventional networks, heterogeneous in-formation networks involve di ff erent types of objects (e.g., papers and conference) that are connected with each other through multiple types of links. Each type of links represents an unique binary relation R from node type i to node type j ,where R ( v ip ,v jq )holdsi ff object v ip and v jq are related by relation R . R  X  1 denotes the inverted relation of R ,which holds naturally for R  X  1 ( v jq ,v ip ). Let dom ( R )= T the domain of relation R , rang ( R )= T j denotes its range. R ( a )= { b : R ( a, b ) } .Forexample,inFigure1,thelinktype  X  write  X  X anbewrittenasarelation R between paper nodes and author nodes. R ( v ip ,v jq )holdsi ff author v jq is one of the authors for paper v ip .Forconvenience,wecanwrite this link type as  X  paper write  X  1  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X  author  X  X r X  T
In heterogenous information networks, objects are also inter-connected through indirect links, i.e. ,paths. Forex-ample, in Figure 1, paper 1 and paper 4 are linked through a sequence of edges:  X  paper 1 write  X  1  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X  author 1 write In order to categorize these paths, we extend the definition of link types to  X  X ath types X , which are named as meta path , similar to [5].

Definition 2 . Meta Path :Ametapath P represents a sequence of relations R 1 ,  X  X  X  ,R ! with constrains that  X  i  X  { 1 ,  X  X  X  , !  X  1 } ,rang ( R i )= dom ( R i +1 ). The meta path P can also be written as P : T 1 R 1  X  X  X   X  T 2 R 2  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  R P corresponds to a composite relation R 1  X  R 2  X   X  X  X   X  R between node type T 1 and T ! +1 . dom ( P )= dom ( R 1 )and rang ( P )= rang ( R ! ). The length of P is ! , i.e. ,thenumber of relations in P .

Di ff erent meta paths usually represent di ff erent semantic relationships among linked objects. In Table 1, we show some examples of meta paths with their corresponding se-mantics. Most conventional relationships studied in network data can naturally be captured by di ff erent meta paths. For example, the paper co-citation relation [1] can naturally be represented by meta path  X  paper cite  X  1  X   X  X  X  X   X  paper cite and the co-citation frequencies can be written as the number of path instances for the meta path. Here a path instance of P ,denotedas p  X  P ,isanuniquesequenceofnodes and links in the network that follows the meta path con-strains. For convenience, we use the node type sequence to represent a meta path, i.e. , P = T 1 T 2  X  X  X T l +1 .Forexample, we use PAP to represent the meta path  X  paper write  X  1  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X  author write  X   X  X  X   X  paper  X . Note that for meta paths involving citation links, we explicitly add arrows to represent the link directions, e.g. ,thepaper co-citation path can be written as P  X  P  X  P .
 Collective Classification in Heterogeneous Informa-tion Networks In this paper, we focus on studying the collective classifica-tion problem on one type of objects, instead of on all types of nodes in heterogeneous information networks. This problem setting exists in a wide variety of applications. The reasons are as follows: in heterogenous information networks, the la-bel space of di ff erent types of nodes are quite di ff erent, where we can not assume all types of node share the same set of label concepts. For example, in medical networks, the label concepts for patient classification tasks are only defined on patient nodes, instead of doctor nodes or medicine nodes. In aspecificclassificationtask,weusuallyonlycareaboutthe classification results on one type of node. Without loss of generality, we assume the node type T 1 is the target objects we need to classify. Suppose we have n nodes in T 1 .On each node v 1 i  X  T 1 ,wehaveavectorofattributes x i  X  R d in the d -dimensional input space, and X = { x 1 ,  X  X  X  , x Let C = { c 1 ,c 2 ,  X  X  X  ,c q } be the q possible class labels. On each node v 1 i  X  T 1 ,wealsohavealabelvariable Y i  X  C indicating the class label assigned to node v 1 i , Y = { Y Assume further that we are given a set of known values Y
L for nodes in a training set L  X  T 1 ,and L denotes the index set for training data. Y L = { y i | i  X  L } ,where y C is the observed labels assigned to node x 1 i .Thenthe task of collective classification in heterogeneous information networks is to infer the values of Y i  X  Y U for the remaining nodes in the testing set ( U = T 1  X  L ).

The inference problem in classification tasks is to esti-mate Pr ( Y|X )givenalabeledtrainingset. Conventional classification approaches usually require i.i.d. assumptions, the inference for each instance is performed independently: Pr ( Y|X )  X  Homogeneous Link-based Dependency In collective classification problems, the labels of related in-stances are not independent, but are closely related with each other. Conventional approaches focus on exploiting label dependencies corresponding to one types of homoge-neous links to improve the classification performances, e.g., citation links in paper classification tasks, co-author links in expert classification tasks. These methods can model all variable Y j (  X  j  X  P ( i )), and P ( i )denotestheindexset of related instances to the i -th instance through meta path P .Hence,byconsideringthesingletypeofdependencies, we will have Pr ( Y|X )  X  Meta Path-based Dependency In heterogeneous information networks, there are complex dependencies not only among instances directly linked through links, but also among instances indirectly linked through dif-ferent meta paths. In order to solve the collective classifi-cation problem more e ff ectively, in this paper, we explicitly consider di ff erent types of meta-path based dependencies in heterogeneous information networks. Meta path-based de-pendences refer to the dependencies among instances that are inter-connected through a meta path.

To the best of our knowledge, meta path-based dependen-cies have not been studied in collective classification research before. Given a set of meta paths S = {P 1 ,  X  X  X  , P m } ,the meta path-based dependency model is P ( i )denotestheindexsetofrelatedinstancestothe i -th instance through meta path P j .

For each meta path, one instance can be connected with multiple related instances in the network. For example, in Figure 2, Paper 1 is correlated with Paper 2, 3 and 4throughmetapath P i = PAFAP , i.e. , P i ( Paper 1) = { Paper 2 , 3 , 4 } .Hence,byconsideringmetapath-basedde-pendencies, we will have Pr ( Y|X )=
For classifying target nodes in a heterogeneous informa-tion network, the most na  X   X ve approach is to approximate Pr ( Y|X )  X  instances are independent from each other. However, this approach can be detrimental to their performance for many reasons. This is particularly troublesome when nodes in het-erogeneous networks have very complex dependencies with each other through di ff erent meta paths.

In this section, we propose a simple and e ff ective algo-rithm for meta path-based collective classification in hetero-geneous information networks. We aim to develop a model to estimate the probabilities Pr We first introduce how to extract the set of meta paths from aheterogeneousinformationnetwork,thenproposeourcol-lective classification algorithm, called Hcc (Heterogeneous Collective Classification).

We first consider how to extract all meta paths in a hetero-geneous information network of bounded length ! max .When ! max is small, we can easily generate all possible meta paths as follows: We can organize all the type-correct relations into a prefix tree, called dependence tree .InFigure3,we show an example of dependence tree in ACM conference networks. The target nodes for classification are the paper nodes, and each paper node in the dependence tree corre-sponds to an unique meta path, indicating one type of de-pendencies among paper instances. However, in general the number of meta paths grows exponentially with the maxi-mum path length ! max .Asithasbeenshowedin[5],long meta paths may not be quite useful in capturing the link-age structure of heterogeneous information networks. In this paper, we only exploit the instance dependences with short meta paths ( ! max =4).

In many really world network data, exhaustively extract-ing all meta paths may result in large amount of redun-dant meta paths, e.g. , PVPVP .Includingredundantmeta paths in a collective classification model can result in over-fitting risks, because of additional noisy features. Many of the redundant meta paths are constructed by combining two or more meta paths, e.g. ,metapath PVPVP can be con-structed by two PVP paths. In order to reduce the model X  X  overfitting risk, we extract all meta paths that cannot be decomposed into shorter meta paths (with at least one non-trivial meta paths). Here non-trivial meta paths refer to the paths with lengths greater than 1. For example, in ACM conference network, meta paths like P  X  PAP can be de-composed into P  X  P and PAP ,thuswillbeexcludedfrom our meta path set. In Figure 4, we showed the meta path set extract process as the  X  X nitialization X  step of our proposed method. By breadth-first search on the dependence tree, our model first select shortest meta paths from the network. Then longer meta paths are incrementally selected into path set S until we reach a meta path that can be decomposed into shorter meta paths in S .

After the meta path set S is extracted from the het-erogeneous information network, we then show how to use these meta paths to perform collective classification e ff ec-tively. Conventional collective classification based on itera-tive inference process, e.g. ICA (Iterative Classification Al-gorithm) [4, 3], provide a simple yet very e ff ective method for collective classification in homogeneous networks. Inspired by the success of these iterative inference methods, in this paper, we propose a similar framework for meta path-based collective classification method. This approach is called Hcc (Heterogeneous Collective Classification), summarized in Figure 4.

The general idea is as follows: we model the joint proba-bility based on the following assumption: if instance v 1 i v 1 j are not connected via any meta path in S ,thevariable Y is conditional independent from Y j given the labels of all v  X  X  related instances, i.e. , { v 1 j | j  X  the local conditional probability each instance X  X  label can be modeled by a base learner with extended relational fea-tures built upon the predicted Y j  X  X  ( j  X  the joint probability can be modeled based on these local conditional probabilities by treating the instances as being independent.

In collective classification, each instance may be linked with di ff erent number of instances through one meta path. In order to build a fixed number of relational features for each instance, we employs aggregation functions to combine the predictions on the labels of related instances. Many aggregation functions can be used here, such as COUNT and MODE aggregators [3]. In this paper, we use the weighted label fraction of the related instances as the relational feature for each meta path. We calculate the average fraction of each label appearing in the related instances. Each related instance is re-weighted by the number of path instances from the current node, e.g., for meta path PAP ,thepapersthat share more authors in their author lists are more likely to share similar topics than those only share one author. In detail, given an aggregation function, we can get one set of relational features from the labels of related instances for each meta path, as shown in Figure 5.

Inspired by the success of ICA framework [3] in collective classification, we designed a similar inference procedure for our Hcc method as shown in Figure 4. (1) For inference steps, the labels of all the unlabeled instances are unknown. Figure 5: Get meta path-based relational features We first bootstrap an initial set of label estimation for each instance using content attributes of each node. In our cur-rent implementation, we simply set the relational features of unlabeled instances with zero vectors. Other strategies for bootstrap can also be used in this framework. (2) Itera-tive Inference :weiterativelyupdatetherelationalfeatures based on the latest predictions and then these new features are used to update the prediction of local models on each in-stance. The iterative process terminates when convergence criteria are met. In our current implementation, we update the variable Y i in the ( r +1)-thiteration ( say  X  Y ( r +1) the predicted values in the r -th iteration (  X  Y ( r ) j ACM Conference Dataset: It was extracted from ACM digital library 1 in 2011. ACM digital library provides de-tailed bibliographic information on ACM conference pro-ceedings, including paper abstracts, citation, author infor-mation etc. We extract two ACM sub-networks contain-ing conference proceedings before the year 2011.The first subset, i.e. , ACM Conference-A ,involves14conferencesin computer science: SIGKDD, SIGMOD, SIGIR, SIGCOMM, CIKM, SODA, STOC, SOSP, SPAA, MobiCOMM, VLDB, WWW, ICML and COLT. The network structure is sum-marized in Figure 1, which involves five types of nodes and five types of relations/links. This network includes 196 con-ference proceedings ( e.g. ,KDD X 10,KDD X 09, etc. ), 12.5K papers, 17K authors and 1.8K authors X  a ffi liations. On each paper node, we extract bag-of-words representation of the paper title and abstract to use as content attributes. The stop-words and rare words that appear in less than 100 pa-pers are removed from the vocabulary. Each paper node in the network is assigned with a class label, indicating the ACM index term of the paper including 11 categories. The task in this dataset is to classify the paper nodes based on both local attributes and the network information. The sec-ond subset, i.e. , ACM Conference-B ,involvesanother12 conferences in computer science: ACM Multimedia, OSDI, GECCO, POPL, PODS, PODC, ICCAD, ICSE, ICS, ISCA, ISSAC and PLDI. The network includes 196 corresponding conference proceedings, 10.8K papers, 16.8K authors and 1.8K authors X  a ffi liations. After removing stop-words in the paper title and abstracts, we get 0.4K terms that appears in at least 1% of the papers.
 Compared Methods  X  Heterogeneous Collective Classification ( Hcc ): The pro-posed approach exploits dependencies based on multiple meta paths for collective classification.  X  Homogeneous Collective Classification ( Ica ): Our imple-mentation of the ICA (Iterative Classification Algorithm) [3] by only using homogeneous network information for col-lective classification. In the homogeneous information net-works, only paper-paper links are used.  X  Combined Path Relations ( Cp ): A baseline for multi-relational collective classification [2]: We first convert the http://dl.acm.org/ heterogeneous information networks into multiple relational networks with one type of nodes and multiple types of links. Each link type corresponds to a meta path in the Hcc method. Then, the Cp method combines multiple link types into a homogeneous network by ignoring the link types. We then train one Ica model to perform collective classification on the combined network.  X  Collective Ensemble Classification ( Cf ): Our implementa-tion of the collective ensemble classification [2], which trains one collective classification model on each link types. We use the same setting of the Cp method to extract multi-relational networks. Then we use Ica as the base models for collective classification. For the iterative inference, each model vote for the class label of each instance, and predic-tion aggregation was performed in each iteration. Thus this process is also called collective fusion, where each base model can a ff ect each other in the collective inference step.  X  Ceiling of Hcc ( Hcc -ceiling): One claim of this paper is that Hcc can e ff ectively infer the labels of linked unlabeled instances using iterative inference process. To evaluate this claim, we include a model which use the ground-truth labels of the related instances during the inference. This method illustrate a ceiling performance of Hcc can possibly achieve by knowing the true label of related instances.  X  Hcc with all meta-paths ( Hcc -all): Another claim of this paper is that selected meta path in Hcc can e ff ectively capture the dependencies in heterogeneous information net-works and avoiding overfitting. To evaluate this claim, we include a model which uses all possible meta paths with amaximumpathlengthof5. Thismethodillustratesthe performance of Hcc if we exhaustively involves all possible path-based dependencies without selection.

We use LibSVM with linear kernel as the base classifier for all the compared methods. The maximum number of iteration all methods are set as 10.
 Performances of Collective Classification :10times3-fold cross validations are performed on each heterogeneous information network to evaluate the collective classification performances. We report the detailed results in Figure 6. It shows the performances of the six methods on three datasets with box plots, including the smallest/largest results, lower quartile, median and upper quartile.

The first observation we have in Figure 6 is as follows: almost all the collective classification methods that explic-itly exploit the label dependencies from various aspects, can achieve better classification accuracies than the baseline Svm , which classify each instance independently. These results can support the importance of collective classification by ex-ploiting the di ff erent types of dependencies in network data. For example, Ica outperformances Svm by exploiting auto-correlation among instances while considering only one type of links, i.e. ,citationlinks. Cf and Cp methods can also improve the classification performances by exploiting mul-tiple types of dependencies. Similar results have also been reported in collective classification literatures.
Then we find that our meta path-based collective clas-sification method ( Hcc )consistentlyandsignificantlyout-perform other baseline methods. Hcc can utilize the meta path-based dependencies to exploit the heterogenous net-work structure more e ff ectively. These results support our claim that in heterogeneous information networks, instances can be correlated with each other through various meta paths. Exploiting the complex dependencies among the re-lated instances ( i.e. ,variousmetapath-baseddependencies) can e ff ectively extract the heterogenous network structural information and thus boost the classification performance.
We further observe that the Hcc models perform com-parably with the Hcc -ceiling models which had access to the true label of related instances. This indicates that the Hcc model reach its full potential in approximated infer-ence process. In addition, Hcc method with a small set of representative paths can achieve also comparable perfor-mances with Hcc -all models which includes all meta path combinations with path length ! max  X  5. And the per-formances of Hcc are more stable than those Hcc -all in ACM datasets. In ACM Conference-B dataset, Hcc method with fewer meta-paths can even outperform Hcc -all method. These results support our second claim that the heteroge-neous dependencies can be captured e ff ectively by selecting asmallsetofrepresentativemeta-pathsandthusour Hcc model can avoid overfitting than using all meta paths.
In this paper, we studied the collective classification prob-lem in heterogeneous information networks. We propose a novel solution to collective classification in heterogeneous in-formation networks, called Hcc ,whichcane ff ectivelyassign labels to a group of interconnected instances involving dif-ferent meta path-based dependencies. The proposed Hcc model is able to capture the subtlety of di ff erent dependen-cies among instances with respect to di ff erent meta paths.
