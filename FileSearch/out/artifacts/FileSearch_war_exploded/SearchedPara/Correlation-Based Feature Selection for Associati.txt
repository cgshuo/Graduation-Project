 The advancement in medical ima g in g has res u lted in many breakthro ug hs in the med-especially by the radio g raphers. As h ug e n u mber of di g ital ima g es is bein g created, it becomes problematic for stora g e and retrieval. In addition, the semantic g ap prob-lem, which is the difference in the representation of di g ital ima g es and the act u al keyword q u ery from the u ser, increases the diffic u lty for effective retrieval of those q u ery by example (QBE) to overcome the semantic g ap problem may not be practical in this context. 
Fort u nately, recent technolo g y in medical ima g in g allows for metadata bein g asso-ciated with the ima g es. Those metadata can facilitate for text-based retrieval, in which those ima g es are indexed based on their metadata or annotations and the key-word-based q u ery s u bmitted by the u ser will be matched to the indexed metadata for retrieval. D u e to limited information stored as metadata for each ima g e, s u ch a sys-tem will not be effective for rob u st retrieval of medical ima g es. Therefore, the per-formance of s u ch a retrieval system can be si g nificantly improved by addin g semantic annotation onto the ima g es for indexin g . 
A u tomatic and semi-a u tomatic ima g e annotation can be accomplished thro ug h classification of ima g es accordin g to label of concepts. S u ch labels will be consi-Fort u nately, the set of label of concepts has been established in the medical field for the patholo g ical description of certain diseases. As s u ch, this paper investi g ates the problem of annotatin g mammo g raphy ima g es into n or ma l , be n i gn or ma li gnan t classes that represent the sta g es of breast cancer. 
Association r u les (AR) minin g g ain pop u larity as the classification techniq u e for semantic annotation. Generally, this approach will g enerate many r u les based on the As s u ch, there will be many r u les g enerated for each of the classes. Similar to other data minin g approaches, the performance of AR depends lar g ely of the feat u res u sed for the minin g task. A h ug e n u mber of feat u res u sed may enhance the classification acc u racy, b u t will affect the efficiency of AR thro ug h the g eneration of too many itemset as well as r u les. The n u mber of feat u res can be red u ced thro ug h the process of feat u re selection to improve the efficiency and to maintain or improve the acc u racy of the classification. As s u ch, this paper investi g ates the effect of u sin g Correlation-based Feat u re Selection (CFS) for association r u les minin g in the context of mammo-g raphy ima g e classification. The remainin g of this paper is ordered as follows. Related work is presented in Section 2. In Section 3, a detailed disc u ssion on Correlation-based Feat u re Selection approach is presented. The experimental set u p and analysis is g iven in Section 4. Section 5 describes the concl u sion and f u t u re work. The q u ality of decision for a u tomatic dia g nosis in the medical field depends on the feat u re selection red u ces n u mber of feat u res, removes noisy or irrelevant data, th u s speedin g u p the minin g process. Hence, minin g on a red u ced set of data helps to make the association r u le pattern to be discovered easily and to improve its predictive acc u -racy. There are two types of data red u ction methods, which are wrapper and filter methods. Even tho ug h wrapper methods can prod u ce better res u lt, they are expensive for the lar g e dimensional database. On the other hand filter method is comp u tationally simple and fast and precedes the act u al association r u le g eneration process. Filter methods u se some properties of the data to select the feat u re. An intrinsic property s u ch as entropy has been u sed as a filter method for feat u re selection. In [2], Lei Y u et a l. proposed a selection method u sin g a correlation meas u re that identifies red u ndant feat u res. Many pop u lar search proced u res like particle swarm optimization, seq u ential forward selection, seq u ential backward selection, g enetic search, etc. have been pro-posed in many researches. Genetic Al g orithms are effectively applied to a variety of problems like feat u re selection problems [3], data minin g problems [4], sched u lin g problems [5], machine learnin g problems [6,7], m u ltiple objective problems [8,9], and travelin g salesman problems [10]. Since the u nivariate filters does not j u stify for interactions between feat u res m u ltivariate filter correlation based feat u re selection (CFS) can be u sed to overcome the drawback of the u nivariate filter for determinin g the best feat u re s u bset. sociation r u les s u ch as Genetic Al g orithm (GA). Manish Sa gg ar et a l. [11] have u sed the GA to optimize the r u les g enerated by the Apriori al g orithm. The r u le based clas-sification systems can even predict ne g ative r u les with the improvements applied to GAs. Ashish Ghosh et al. [12] solved the m u lti-objective r u le minin g problems by representin g the r u les as chromosomes u sin g Michi g an approach. Virendra K u mar et.al [13] extracted interestin g association r u les u sin g an optimized GA u sin g the meas u res like interestin g ness, completeness, s u pport and confidence. Nikhil Jain et.al [14] u sed a g enetic al g orithm for the whole process of optimization of the r u le set to find a red u ction of Ne g ative and P ositive Association R u le Minin g . Amy et.al [15] proposed Hybrid g enetic al g orithm for minin g workflow best practices, u sin g correla-g enetic al g orithm for a str u ct u red method to find the u nknown facts in lar g e data sets. Jesmin Nahar et al. [17] proposed Association r u le minin g for the detection of sick and healthy heart disease factors, u sin g the UCI Cleveland dataset, a biolo g ical data-base. S u fal et.al [18] proposed a method of u tilizin g linka g e amon g feat u re selections u sin g M u lti-objective Genetic Al g orithm for data q u ality minin g . Don g Gy u Lee et al [19] u sed Genetic al g orithm for g eneratin g association r u les related to hypertension and diabetes in discoverin g medical knowled g e for yo u n g ad u lts with ac u te myocar-dial infarction. Ramesh K u mar et.al [20] proposed a novel g enetic al g orithm for the prioritization of association r u les prod u ced by the Apriori al g orithm and tested for the fo u r different data sets. Basheer et.al [21] proposed a m u lti-objective g enetic al g o-Malar Vizhi et al. [22] proposed a g enetic al g orithm u sin g m u lti-objective evol u tio-r u les. To u rnament selection and m u ltipoint crossover methods were u sed for a lar g e n u mber of attrib u tes in the database for flexibility. The approach has been tested for only n u merical and cate g orical val u ed attrib u tes. Bettahally et.al [23] compared conventional minin g al g orithm, i.e. Apriori al g orithm with the proposed g enetic al g o-rithm in local search for privacy preservin g over distrib u ted databases. In the Apriori al g orithm pop u lation is formed in only sin g le rec u rsion, b u t in g enetic al g orithm pop-u lation is formed in every new prod u ction. To overcome the disadvanta g es of Apriori al g orithm, Genetic al g orithm can be u sed for association r u le minin g . Above research g ap helps to improve the Apriori al g orithm as well as an existin g Genetic al g orithm, which can f u rther be improved. In g eneral, several feat u res are u s u ally u sed to describe the character of an object. The characteristic feat u res that are u sed to classify the normal and abnormal lesions can be represented as mathematical descriptions. Feat u re extraction methodolo g y analyses mammo g ram ima g es to extract the most prominent feat u res that represent vario u s classes of the ima g es. Unlike the complicated process of a h u man observer to identify a mass, the machine makes decisions with only limited feat u res. In this paper, the statistical text u re feat u res s u ch as contrast, coefficient, entropy, ener g y, homo g eneity and a few other Haralick [24] and Soh [25] feat u res that efficiently classify the beni g n and mali g nant mammo g rams are extracted with the distance between the pixel of interest and its nei g hbor eq u al to 1 and the an g le of 0 .Let p(i,j) be the (i,j)th entry in a normalized Gray Level Co-occ u rrence Matrix (GLCM). X  and are the mean and stan-dard deviation for the rows and col u mns of the matrix. chine learnin g . Theoretically, the more discriminatin g power can be achieved by hav-in g more feat u res, b u t c u rrent machine learnin g toolkits are not s u fficient to deal with u p to date datasets [26]. Many of the feat u res extracted d u rin g the trainin g phase are either partially or completely irrelevant to an object that has no effect on the tar g et concept. The feat u re selection process helps to remove red u ndant and irrelevant fea-t u res, th u s red u cin g the feat u re space. This minimizes the comp u tation time and helps in improvin g the prediction acc u racy [27]. Data red u ction methods are of two types, wrapper and filter methods. On the other hand filter approach meas u res the feat u re s u bset relevance and is independent of learnin g al g orithm. Since the u nivariate filters does not j u stify for interactions between feat u res we u se m u ltivariate filter correlation based feat u re selection (CFS) to determine the best feat u re s u bset. Correlation based Feat u re Selection involves he u ristic search to eval u ate the s u bset of feat u res. This is a simple filter al g orithm based on correlation he u ristic f u nction. This f u nction eval u ates the s u bsets that are hi g hly correlated and u ncorrelated with each other and class. The feat u res are accepted dependin g on its level of extent in predictin g its class. The fea-t u res that did not infl u ence the class will be i g nored as irrelevant feat u res. The sta g es of CFS are shown in combination with data discretization in Fi g . 1. 
The mammo g ram trainin g data are discretized first and then passed to CFS. For the prediction of class labels, this CFS considers the efficacy of individ u al feat u res and its inter-correlation. If g iven the inter-correlation between each pair of feat u res and the where cr zc = he u ristic merit of a feat u re s u bset for f n u mber of feat u res, c zi r the = avera g e of the correlations between the class and the feat u res, c r ii = avera g e inter-correlation between feat u re pairs [28]. The s u bset with the hi g hest cr zc val u e is u sed to red u ce the data dimensionality.
 The feat u re selection process to g ether with CFS u nder g oes some search proced u re. This paper u ses Weka GA as a search method with CFS as a s u bset eval u atin g me-chanism. Genetic al g orithm (GAs) is modeled based on the process of nat u ral selec-tion. At every iteration new pop u lations are g enerated from old ones in each iteration. They are act u ally binary encoded strin g s. Every strin g is eval u ated to meas u re its fitness val u e for the problem. Likewise the entire g eneration of new strin g s can be comp u ted u sin g the g enetic operators, on an initially random pop u lation. This opera-tive way of discoverin g lar g e search space is essential for feat u re selection. The indi-vid u al fitness can be decided by the correlation between the feat u res. Based on the correlation coefficient the individ u als will be assi g ned a rank by the fitness f u nction. The feat u res that have the lower correlation coefficients and with hi g her fitness val u e will be appropriate for crossover operations. 3.1 Dataset and Selection of ROI The data set u sed in this experiment is taken from the di g ital database for mammo-g raphy from the University of So u th Florida [29], which is DDSM. All ima g es are di g itized u sin g LUMISYS Scanner at a resol u tion of 50 microns, and at 12 bit g rays-cale levels. The dataset consists of 240 ima g es that incl u de three cate g ories of which 80 are normal, 80 are beni g n and 80 are mali g nant. Then, the re g ion of interest (ROI) is isolated within those ima g es as the preprocessin g step. We u se the conto u r s u pplied to g ether with the ima g es in the DDSM dataset to extract ROIs of size 256 x 256 pixels. 
A total of 242 ROIs are extracted with the mass centered in a window of size 256 X 256 pixels, where 162 are abnormal ROIs (circ u mscribed masses, spec u lated masses, ill-defined masses and architect u ral distortion) and 80 are normal ROIs. 3.2 Association Rules Mining For each ima g e, the selected discretized feat u res are stored in s u ch a way that n col-u mns represent n feat u res while the last col u mn represent a class (e g . n or ma l, be n i gn and ma li gnan t ). Two association r u les minin g techniq u es are u sed to discover the al g orithm and also a modified g enetic al g orithm based association r u le minin g , GARM. The Apriori al g orithm tends to prod u ce a h ug e n u mber of r u les, that is re-d u ndant and may not be efficient. On the other hand, g enetic al g orithm (GA), s u ch as GARM can g enerate g ood r u les by performin g a g lobal search with better attrib u te interactions th u s can improve the effectiveness of association r u le minin g . For each cate g ory in the database, the GA is applied separately to constr u ct sets of r u les. For each r u le the fitness val u e is calc u lated and the r u le that has the hi g hest fitness val u e each cate g ory are pooled to form r u le set. New pop u lation can be comp u ted u sin g the g enetic operators like reprod u ction, crossover, and m u tation to extract the best local r u les. 3.3 Classification The extracted set of r u les represents the act u al classifier. It classifies a new ima g e to its cate g ory. When a new ima g e is provided, a feat u re vector is extracted and it searches in the r u les for matchin g classes. Then, the n u mber of matched r u les for each class is calc u lated. Based on the matched r u les in each class, the avera g e co n fide n ce score is calc u lated. The class for the new ima g e is identified based on the hi g hest avera g e co n fide n ce score in the class and the n u mber of r u les matched. The al g orithm describes the classification of a new ima g e. 
Input: N u mber of cate g ory C , list of trainin g r u les for each cate g ory Ci , N u mber of r u les n in each cate g ory C j , Total n u mber of r u les N 
Output : Cate g ory attached to the new ima g e 3.4 Experimental Results In order to eval u ate the performance of the CFS feat u re selection method, the 10-fold each class is formed. One g ro u p is selected as the test ima g es and the remainin g nine ima g e in the test g ro u p is identified and avera g e acc u racy meas u re (AC) of the classi-fication is meas u red as follows: and C 3 , respectively, while N T is the total n u mber of ima g es in the test g ro u p. 
The avera g e acc u racy meas u re (AC) for CFS with Apriori and GARM al g orithms is a depicted in Table 1. The res u lt shows that a mar g inal performance improvement can be achieved when CFS is u sed before the application of both AR al g orithms, with an improvement of 2.9% and 6% for the avera g e AC on Apriori and GARM al g o-rithm, respectively. This findin g indicates that the feat u re selection process can po-tentially improve the effectiveness of AR based classification on mammo g raphy im-netic al g orithm based association r u les minin g as compared to the classical Apriori al g orithm. Fi g . 3 &amp; Fi g . 4 show the comparison of AC for different al g orithms in each g ro u p. Based on the fi gu re, it clearly shows that the classification has more effective as the CFS consistently shown better performance in all g ro u ps as compared to not u sin g CFS for both AR al g orithms. An interestin g findin g s show that g enetic al g orithm based association r u les witho u t CFS does not have a si g nificant impact on the classi-fication performance as compared to the classical Apriori al g orithm witho u t CFS which is only 1.7% difference, despite bein g more efficient. It also learnt that the difference in performance for both classical Apriori al g orithm and g enetic al g orithm can be enlar g ed with the u se of CFS with 4.4% difference. This paper investi g ates the effect of u sin g feat u re selection process, CFS, on two AR al g orithms, the classical Apriori al g orithm and a g enetic al g orithm based AR al g o-rithm, GARM, for the mammo g raphy ima g e classification problem. The res u lt is promisin g , where the al g orithms are able to achieve 88% correct classification u sin g GARM with CFS compared to [30] witho u t any feat u re selection. In addition, the u se of feat u re selection, CFS, can improve the classification performance of both AR al g orithms. However, the benefit of u sin g an efficient GARM al g orithm does not necessarily improve the classification acc u racy. O u r f u rther work will be on GA for optimization of Association R u le Minin g to improve the classification acc u racy for an a u tomatic dia g nosis and s ugg estions of possible patholo g ical terms.
