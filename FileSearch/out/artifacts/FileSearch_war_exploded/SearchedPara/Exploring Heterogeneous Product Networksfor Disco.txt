 With the booming of online business, user comments on products and online stores are increasingly important for shaping customer decision. These user com-ments are valuable and represent the opinion and judgement of  X  X xperienced X  product users. Sales and profits link with reviews, which entice merchants to hire a group of people to fabricate fake reviews to unjustly hype and denigrate competitors. Therefore, it is essential to detect these fake reviews to restore user confidence on online business.
 Previous works focus on capturing important features from user review behavior data, review network data, and store network data [ 1 , 2 , 4  X  7 ]. These work can successfully detect the marketing hyping behavior when spammer accounts are manipulated by one or several people with massive false comments. However, applying for an hyping account is costly and it is infeasible to generate a large amount of fake accounts to do marketing hyping. Moreover, existing spam review approaches are mainly generated by real users on purpose under anom-alous comments, and the comments can also have large variety which makes the spam detection even more difficult. The work [ 12 ] provided a new perspective to detect the spam comment without any content of reviews and network informa-tion, where they define singleton reviewers as the spammers who just reviewed once or very few times. Then, they define the problem as the abnormal detecting problem and utilize statistic method to reveal positive reviews with high rating ascend with singleton users burst in a certain period.
 itation in the user Cloud environment. To date, many 3-party platforms provide the service of connecting online sellers with marketing hyping require, where massive random users (user Cloud) conduct real transactions and reviews and then reclaim bonus. In contrast, existing works never take the product network into consider. They only use the user/product network for detection. Because user profile and user behavior can be easily changed or hidden, existing methods can be easily darted by E-commerce Service Providers. In other words, exist-ing works ignore the latent connections in product networks and the connec-tion on product is hard to conceal, especially when the hyping activities has become popular among homogeneous competitors. Moreover, they separately use linguistic clues of deception or relational network information and can only just detect these unjustly activities by a sole product. These shortage not only makes detection rules easily avoid by spam activities, but also leads to inaccurate detection results.
 ing users, i.e., Collective Marketing Hyping detection. To solve the problem, we need to address the following two challenges:  X  How to infer the latent heterogenous product information network? The net-works may not be observed directly from the original data sets, to build such networks, we need to infer the relationship matrix among products by their potential connections such as product ID/name, and the store ID/name that sales the similar products. These information are normally latent and require in-depth analysis on the background data.  X  How to model the heterogenous product information networks? We need to design a new learning model that can fully combine the power of the relational data and the heterogenous product information networks for discovering col-lective behaviour among products.
 can use the heterogenous product network information and temporal features to discover a group of marketing hyping activities. As shown in Fig. 1 , the product network information is employed to design two product network regularization terms that constraint the matrix factorization based learning function. Specifi-cally, different products within the same store and homogeneous products within different stores are extracted from the original data sets and formulated as the two graph regularization terms in the learning function. Experiments on real-life data show the performance of the proposed method. The contributions of the paper are summarized as follows,  X  We define a new research problem of detecting a group of marketing hyping users, i.e., the Collective Marketing Hyping detection problem. Different from existing online spam activity detection problems, we aim to use the latent heterogenous product networks to detect a group of products containing deceitful comments.  X  We design a new unsupervised learning model to incorporate both comment patterns (temporal patterns) and online heterogenous product network data for pattern analysis.  X  We conduct experiments on real-life data. The results shows that our model can effectively detect the collective marketing hyping activities.
 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 ,weprovide an overview of several mainstream approaches for online spam detection and the related work. Section 3 describes the background and methodology of the work. Section 4 presents experimental results on real-life data, followed by the conclusion in Sect. 5 . In this section, we survey the related research in opinion spam detection and compare them with our present work.
 Opinion and Sentimental Mining. There are research works in mining opin-ions and sentiments behind the rating and review data. McAuley [ 10 ] introduced a new dataset of roughly 5 million reviews with multi-dimensional ratings. It is of great challenge to not only model such data but also learning words describe aspects and words refer to sentiment about an aspect simultaneously. After that, they [ 9 ] propose statistical models which connect underlying dimensions in rat-ing score to aspects in review text on a large-scale dataset. Besides, a model [ 11 ] has been designed and utilized for capturing the evolution of users or community in recommendation system by integrating users experience-as component -into the function of time, when comparing with other method. This model can find similar users even their opinions far apart in a certain time.
 ions from reviews by utilizing natural language processing and data mining tech-niques. In other words, they just analyze the latent properties and sentiments on the product or store, but ignore the authenticity of these comments and eval-uations. Thus, they cannot tackle the problem of opinion spam unless deriving new features.
 Review Spam Detection. Review spam detection techniques are proposed with the evolution of new spammer approaches. Liu [ 4 , 5 ] has studied the trust-worthiness of opinions in reviews. It is the first investigation in opinion spam. Three categories of review spam were defined -untruthful opinions, review on brands only and non-reviews. The last two types are relatively easily to be classi-fied by manually labelled. For the first type, it is very hard for labelling by human being. Due to this limitation, only reviews making damage to products and rep-utation were taken into account and many duplicate or near-duplicated spam reviews (almost certainly) were found. Thus, this no labelled training example problem was solved.
 the product-has not been considered. Furthermore, current spammers can avoid providing massive duplicate text. Li [ 7 ] first analyzed several features in terms of spam behaviours, e.g., Content features, Sentiment Features, Product Features, Meta-data features, etc. Then, a two-view semi-supervised method was exploited to identify spam reviews. Feng [ 2 ] introduced the notion of natural distribution of opinions and define three types of reviewers: Any-time reviewers, Multi-time reviewers and Single-time Reviewers. Furthermore, these different types of dis-tributional footprints of deceptive reviews were evaluated statistically by NLP techniques, rather than relying on relatively unreliable human judgement. How-ever, one-time reviewers, the most suspicious user type, is more or less stable in the ratio to multi-time reviewers since 2007 in the dataset, which means there may existing spammer groups but cannot be found by their method. Jindal [ 6 ] defined several types of expectations based on the original distribution of dataset. It then uses certain unexpectedness measures to rank rules for indicating unusual behaviours as spam activities. However, this study aims to quantify the ratio of abnormal reviews in the on-line e-commercial platforms, rather than detecting the trustiness of the reviews on certain product. Besides, review text understand-ing, rating is also another element for detecting the spammers. In [ 1 ], it mainly exploited models to detect spammed products or product groups by compar-ing the difference of rating behaviour between suspicious and normal users. The ranking and supervised methods used are high efficient in identifying spammers and the result reveal the spammer have more significant impact on rating, rather than unhelpful reviewers.
 Detect Spam Activities by Temporal Feature. Xie [ 12 ] abandoned the text data and rating features but just focused on the temporal patterns. This work firstly constructs multidimensional time series refer to singleton reviewers (user who has just written one review) for leveraging correlated anomalies. However, the obvious defect is they assume customers (who really purchased something) will never be spammers and singleton reviewer is surely belongs to the spammer group. They did not consider not only the percentage of genuine buyer purchase several items but just leave one review on one product, but also deceptive users can follow the real purchasing process to give genuine but hired sentiment com-ments. The work [ 2 ] defined the review bursts and use Kernel Density Estimation with several features to detect them. It then proposed a model based on Markov Random Field, and utilize reviewer-reviews-store graph to detect spammers. In this section, we first introduce our model in Sect. 3.1 , and then describe the algorithm in Sect. 3.2 .
 3.1 Product Network Regularization In this section, we first discuss the dataset we collected during our project, and then we will systematically interpret how to model the heterogenous product networks as regularization terms to constrain the matrix factorization learning framework.
 In the beginning of 2015, counterfeits crisis on Taobao.com trigger heated debate between Alibaba and the Chinese Consumer Association, shortened for CCA. According to CCA X  X  report, large proportion of fake goods exist in the top 10 Taobao online store of variety industries, including raiment,cosmetics, milk, health etc. Thus, we first search the top 10 stores from these reported industries and then collect at least top 10 best sale products in these stores. In Table 1 ,we list the collected dataset.
 Based regularization method and the product-Based regularization approach. In this paper,  X  X BR X  refers to Product-Based Regularization and  X  X BR X  represents Store-Based Regularization.
 Store-Based Regularization. As mentioned in Sect. 1 , online sellers tend to implement untrustful hyping actions regularly, to keep their high rank position. These competitor are more likely to observe each other, rather than directly inform them to united join in. In other words, the collective marketing hyping are an tacit competition among homogeneous stores and products, e.g.,protein powder with same brand in healthy store. They should share similar behaviours when they have similar position in ranking system. Based on this intuition,we impose a Store-based Regularization term to minimize the distance between two same product in different store, ranked products will share similar patterns if they are same merchandise within different stores. Thus, they have very large possibility in the same cluster. How-ever, this may not always be true in the real world. For example, some high rank merchant may make better reputation and profit by regular method while others need untrustful hyping. Hence,a more realistic model should also take other fea-tures into consider, e.g., the meta data G 1 is a matrix to represent Store-Based network. Figure 2 describes how to build the network. For every product with the same name and brand within all stores, we set up their connection values as 1; otherwise, 0.
 Product-Based Regularization. The first model we propose imposes a Store-Based regularization term to constrain product similarity among different stores. However, this approach is insensitive to those different products within the same store. This will cause information loss problem, which will result in inaccurate modeling. Hence, in order to tackle this problem, we propose another product regularization term to impose constraints among products within their own store. Thus, we also introduce second regularization term for minimize the deviation between dissimilar products within same store, Specifically, we believe merchants who utilize unfairly technique will hype many of their products, rather than only one type. Therefore, products pos-sess similar sales in certain store should also with similar pattern. In Fig. 3 ,we describe the Product-Based network and denote the matrix as G to G , we only set up connection value as 1 when products are within the same store; otherwise, 0.
 Feature Representation. Feature transformation can reduce the dimension-sequence T = { t 1 , t 2 ,..., t n } and features S = { s the sequence-transformed data matrix, where X ( s each sequential feature s i and the original data t j . The distances can be calcu-lated by Eq. ( 3 ), where q = q j  X  l i +1 denotes the total number of segments with length l review sequence t j , q j ,l i are the lengths of comment sequences t s respectively.
 However, the function given in Eq. ( 3 ) is not continuous, Thus, we use the soft minimum function as in Eq. ( 4 )[ 3 ] Review Sequence Similarity. We use H ( ij ) to represent the similarity between two temporal features s i and s j , which can be calculated as in Eq. ( 5 ), Pseudo-Class Label. In this part, we consider unlabeled data training. Note labeled data is a special case of our model where the class label is given a prior, and the iterations on the class label during learning can be removed. Provide that we cluster user review sequence data into c class, the pseudo-class label matrix V  X  R c  X  n contains the c labels.
 Least Square Minimization. Based on the pseudo-class labels, we wish to minimize the least square error. Let U  X  R k  X  c be the classification boundary under the pseudo-class labels, the least square error minimizes the following objective function, The Learning Model. Based on the above notations, the learning model is a joint optimization problem with respect to variables S , U and V ,asinEq.( 7 ), where we aim to minimize the error rate (the first optimization term) under the heterogenous network regularization (the second and third terms). The last two terms are added to avoid overfitting to noisy data. 3.2 The Learning Algorithm In order to solve the above learning function, we use the coordinate descent algorithm to iteratively solve the three variables as below, 1: Input: 2: Output: Sequential feature S and class label V 3: Initialize: S 0 , V 0 , U 0 4: While Not convergent do 5: Step 1 :Update V with Fixed U and S: 6: 7: 8: end while The algorithm iteratively solves the three variables V in Eq. (8), U in Eq. (9) and S in Eq. (10), and eventually converge to the local optimum S V  X  . Because the objective function given in Eq. ( 7 ) is convex, the local solution here is also the global optimum. The algorithm converges fast under the proper parameter settings. In this section, we first describe the output of the learning model, and then give a couple of case studies to provide the analysis of the sequential patterns of the problematic products with deceitful user comments. At last, we use human-labeled data to evaluate the results. 4.1 Human Evaluation In Taobao.com, people purchase items and leave comments. They also have buyer reputation and levels. We invite 20 experienced online buyers who frequently purchase items online to label around 500 products as we collected. Some of these invited users have already participated in online hyping, so they know the rules and strategies of the current hyping techniques. 4.2 Benchmark Methods To show the strength of the heterogenous product networks in detection, we design three methods for comparisons: Only with SRB . Intuitively, although two product network information we men-tioned above are all very important, we assume that the Store-Based regular-ization should be more crucial for discovering the collective behaviours. As such promotion is actually an tacit action among all homogeneous sellers. Hence, we modify the objective function in Eq. ( 7 ) by setting  X  2 Only with PRB . Similar to above method, we also observe the performance when only use Product-Based regularization in Eq. ( 7 ) by setting  X  Without Any Regularizations . To verify how significance of the product network information, we take off all the regularization and just consider the features in meta data. Thus, the learning function is in Eq. ( 7 ) with  X  4.3 Experimental Results We conduct experiments on six datasets. To verify the importance of prod-uct network information, we use both network regularizations (Store-Based and Product-Based) in the algorithm, and then use only one of them for comparisons, as given in the benchmark methods.
 racy drops significantly without any network regularizations. Furthermore, the precision also drops when just taking one network information into consider. Besides, we found that the Store-Based Regularization is more effective than the Product-Based Regularization. The results explain the latent connections of homogeneous competition among online products in different stores.
 4.4 Application: A Case Study In this part, we mainly focus on analysing several interesting cases in our exper-imental results.
 Collective Marketing Hyping. As we discussed before, online stores tend to hire real people to generate real purchase comments to increase their sales. Thus, the sequential patterns of the comments should be relatively similar to each other given the same certain of a time window.
 as given in Fig. 3 . It is very clear that from May to June, 2015, their com-ment sequential patterns are highly similar. Furthermore, due to this period is close to the Chinese Mother X  X  day and Father X  X  day, it is very common for cus-tomers to purchase healthy products for their parents. Therefore, for ranking in a high position, these Online merchants will pay for hyping activities and these fake comments lead to collective hyping with similar user comment sequential patterns (Fig. 5 ).
 The False Negative Study . There are a few cases that the human label as hyping, but our algorithm categorizes it into Non-Hyping groups. Through our analysis, we can infer that our algorithm is correct. As we can see in Fig. 4 , normally, if this problem treats it as an anomaly detection problem, these two stores may be labeled as hyping as they all have a short burst period. However, our method fully considers the overall temporal patterns, not only the burst. Furthermore, we can see that the burst time of these two products are in the special festival In China -the upper one is in the Christmas and New year while another one is close to the 11th of November 1 .
 Overall, there are few ambiguous results generated, However, by taking the heterogeneous network information into account, we can identify the collective hyping activities correctly,with an average detection accuracy of 90 %. In this work we study the problem of collective marketing hyping with fraud intentions generated from a user Cloud. The problem is important and challeng-ing for trustworthy online business. To resolve this problem, we not only use the clustering method to extract user comments X  sequential patterns of each single product, but also detect a group of problematic products by using the latent het-erogenous product information networks. The experimental results have shown that the heterogenous product networks play an important role in clustering user comments. We also correctly identify the collective marketing hyping behaviour from a real-life large-scale E-commerce platform.
