 data and cookies. elements are item-sets. Span will generate many projected databases or false projected databases. mental results. Section 4 is the conclusion. 2.1 Definitions ing constraint: For any node v  X  V ( T ), v . count  X  tively. also denote s as seq ( v m | D ).  X  ate data. of  X  in D is defined to be support frequent event of D. 2.2 Compact Database and Prediction Method (a) x . event = y . event , and (b) they have the same parent or x , y  X  R ( D ), compressible. If not, we say D is incompressible or compact. method defined as the following subroutine. 
Subroutine1: CheckCompact( TFN , TN , NTV , pcr ) 1 if (TFN/TN  X  0.75) then 2 return true 3 else begin 4 P=TFN  X  7  X  pcr; 5 if ((NTV-TN-P)  X  0) then 6 return true 7 else 8 return false 9 end database. Otherwise, it is better to build a compact one. 2.3 TAM-WAP Algorithm Algorithm 1: TAM-WAP ( H  X  ,  X  ,  X  , occ_list , pcr ) 
Input: H  X  , the header table of current projected data-Output: all  X  -pattern having prefix  X  . 
Method: 1 for each element a k in H  X  do begin 2 if (a k .support  X  X  ) then 3 begin 4 output  X  =  X   X  a k .event and ak.support; 5 if ((CheckCompact(TFN,TN,NTV, pcr)==false) then 6 begin 7 build the compact database D  X  ; 8 call TAM-WAP(H  X  ,  X  ,  X  ,occ_list , r); 9 end 10 else 12 call TAM-WAP(H  X  ,  X  ,  X  ,occ_list , pcr); 13 end 14 end 3.1 Experimental Setup hard disk. 3.2 Performance than WAP-mine. 3.3 Scale-Up Experiments has better scalability than WAP. current area. top-down algorithms.
