 1. INTRODUCTION The experience of browsing Wikipedia can be so all-consuming that people colloquially invoke the trope of Alice X  X  fall down into the rabbit hole when they recount a session of Wikipedia surfing. They tell of sessions that could have started with a question about the USS North Carolina and ended several hours later on the page for phylum Echinodermata. In addition to the search function of Wikipedia, and the network of hy perlinks between articles, the Wikipedia community has created several information structures that support navigation. Framed against the backdrop of the theories of classification, and the discipline of information organization, this dissertation will investigate the spectrum of types of information structures that are used for information organization, and will seek to identify the design criteria and evaluative criteria that will best inform the creation and justification of these structures. The question of whether search can replace classification has been pulled into mainstream discussions by Shirky (2005) and Weinberger (2007). It is striking that despite the fact that search works so well in Wikipedia, a nd that Wikipedia is so well-indexed by Google (and other search engines), that the community places importance on creating human-built information structures to suppor t information organization in Wikipedia. Hjorland recently argued that classification cannot be replaced classification as a behavior, he ar gued:  X  X o sum up, to classify is to define the  X  X ind X  which a give n  X  X hing X  is, and how that kind is related to other kinds. This is a fundamental process that all human beings carry out many times each day X  (2012: 307). Perhaps this definitional activity is one of the forces that compels Wikipedians to maintain a category system. As early as 1997 researchers were exploring attempts to combine information retrieval and human-c urated metadata in order to improve information seeking. (E fthimiadis and Carlyle 1997: 5). The fact that multiple structures have been created by the community to organize information in Wikipedia, offers us an opportunity to compare and contrast the goals the community had for these various structures and to provide evaluative criteria that organization of information. Mai reminds us of the recommendations of Svenonius 1986, Fidel 1991 and Rowley 1994, each of whom argues that the combination of using both search and classified directories in conjunction help users in information seeking (2004: 92). Mai tells us that  X  X hen searching for information that can be expressed in multiple ways it is more effective to use classified Web directories X . This could be one reason that the Wikipedia community has invested so much effort in the creation and maintenance of information structures like the category system, the portal system, and navigation boxes despite the fact that the search options in Wikipedia ar e so effective on their own. Williamson reminds us that:  X  X n any event, while information systems may change to achieve greater success, they must continue to meet two fundament al requirements of information seekers: to permit users to locate information on a subject directly and to allow them to browse so as to familiarize themselves with a domain or to refine a request X  (2007: 330). I will use the theory from information organization and information science to explore the large-scale, collaboratively-built systems of information organization: the category system, the information boxes and the Wikidata project within Wikipedia. This work forces us to reconsider the current conceptuali zations and definitions of such structures in information organiza tion, many of which date to the period when information organi zation systems were designed primarily for the control of physical items rather than digital content. 2. CATEGORY SYSTEM Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia created entirely of user-generated content. Roughly two y ears after Wikipedia began, the community decided to create a category system to organize and tag the content of the site (Voss 2006). The category system has changed over time, as have concep tualizations of what role it should serve in Wikipedia. Th e category system was proposed, designed and implemented entirely by members of the Wikipedia community. The Wikipedia community includes anyone who edits Wikipedia. Anyone with access to the internet can edit Wikipedia. Any Wikipedia editor has the ability to apply category labels to pages, to rem ove category labels to pages, to create new categories, and to sugge st categories to be considered http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization Accessed June 29, 2012. Discussion of the category system takes place on the talk page for  X  X ategorization X . 2 Talk pages in Wikipedia are pages, associated with other pages, where editors can leave comments that are publicly visible in order to discuss issues related to the original page. 3 Each article in Wikipedia, for example, has an associated talk page where editors discuss content, propose changes, explain decisions they have made about how the page should look or what the page should contain, etc. Th e fact that discussion about the design and implementation of the category system has been archived within the Wikipedia site presents an opportunity to read the comments editors made throughout this process, and to understand how the category system came to be in its current form. 3. STRUCTURED INFORMATION IN WIKIPEDIA There are several types of information structures in Wikipedia which support information seeking: see also links, information boxes, navigation boxes, the por tal system and the category system. Of these, the category sy stem has the longest history in Wikipedia. The primary focus of this work will be the category system, information boxes a nd Wikidata. The Wikipedia community has explicit goals rela ted to supporting navigation for each of these structures. For the category system they state:  X  X he central goal of the category system is to provide navigational links to all Wikipedia pages in a hierarchy of categories which readers, knowing essential -defini ng -characteristics of a topic, can browse and quickly find sets of pages on topics that are defined by those characteristics X . 4 For infoboxes the community says that they are a type of  X  X ixed-format table designed to be added to the top right-hand corner of articles to consistently present a summary of some unifying aspect that the articles share and sometimes to improve navigation to other interrelated articles X . 5 For navigation boxes the community states:  X  X  grouping of links used in multiple related articles to facilitate navigation between those articles X . 6 Categories are displayed at the bo ttom of Wikipedia pages. Each category into which the page has been grouped is listed as a hyperlink. Clicking on the links takes you to the page for that category. Structured information is freque ntly mined from Wikipedia to populate artificial intelligence app lications or repositories of structured data that other programs utilize. This information is then propagated to many other applications and programs. The importance of researching the stru ctured information in Wikipedia lies in the frequency with which it is reused. As Bao et al. highlight, many information re trieval (IR), natural language processing (NLP), and artificial intelligence-based systems use data mined from Wikipedia. While research into the optimization https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Categorization

Rather than taking the current set of structured data available in Wikipedia as a given, the research I propose in this dissertation will provide us with a framework for discovering what the optimal design of the information structures would be, allowing us to extract an even-more-complete set of structured data from the Wikipedia system. Infoboxes are graphical information resources that can be placed on the upper right-hand corner of an article in Wikipedia. The community uses them to provide a summary of the content on the page and to provide links to related content. They are the source of a large amount of the structured data currently extracted from Wikipedia. implementation, it will serve as th e repository of all structured data for Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia projects. Looking at the category system, the information boxes and the Wikidata project within Wikipedia will allow us to explore three case studies of how information is structured in Wikipedia and how these information structures are collaboratively designed. 4.
