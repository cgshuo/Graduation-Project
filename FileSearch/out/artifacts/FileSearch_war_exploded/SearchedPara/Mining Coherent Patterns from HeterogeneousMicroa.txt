 Microarray technology is a powerful tool for geneticists to monitor interactions among tens of thousands of genes si-multaneously. There has been extensive research on coher-ent subspace clustering of gene expressions measured under consistent experimental settings. However, these methods assume that all experiments are run using the same batch of microarray chips with similar characteristics of noise. Al-gorithms developed under this assumption may not be ap-plicable for analyzing data collected from heterogeneous set-tings, where the set of genes being monitored may be dif-ferent and expression levels may be not directly comparable even for the same gene. In this paper, we propose a model, F-cluster, for mining subspace coherent patterns from het-erogeneous gene expression data. We compare our model with previously proposed models. We analyze the search space of the problem and give a na  X   X ve solution for it.

Recent advances in microarray technology have made large amounts of gene expression data available from a variety of different experimental settings. Clustering is a popular method used to analyze microarrays. A special class of subspace clustering algorithms called bi-clustering can ef-fectively identify meaningful gene groups [12, 13]. By find-ing shifting and/or scaling patterns, bi-clustering algorithms can identify co-regulated genes whose expressions differ in value but are highly correlated. Tricluster [14] extends the model to the temporal domain. It finds clusters in gene-sample-time space.

Although previous methods have demonstrated their use-fulness, all of these methods focus on analyzing expression data generated by a single microarray technique. There have been several microarray techniques using fundamentally dif-ferent mechanisms to measure gene expression levels, includ-ing Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays [5], cDNA mi-croarrays [8], and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) [11]. The expression levels reported by different techniques are not necessarily comparable with each other. Since previ-ously proposed subspace clustering methods were developed under the assumption that the gene expressions are mea-sured under consistent experimental settings, they can not be readily applied to analyze data generated by different techniques.

In the biology community, there has been wide interest in the cross-platform comparisons of gene expression values [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9]. However, these studies have focused on the expression values for individual genes. Statistical and probabilistic methods [4, 10] have been proposed for finding the pair-wise interactions of genes or proteins in heteroge-nous datasets. They are not applicable to finding subspace coherent patterns in heterogenous microarray datasets.
To overcome the limitation of previous methods, we pro-pose a more general model for mining coherent subspace clusters from multiple microarrays that may be generated by different techniques.
We propose the model of F-cluster (Frequent cluster), which mines genes co-expressed in subsets of samples within multiple microarrays. Informally speaking, an F-cluster is a group of genes that show similar expression patterns in some subspaces (of samples) in at least  X  matrices, where  X  is a user specified number. For example, as shown in Figure 1, thegenegroup { g 1 ,g 2 ,g 3 } is an F-cluster which is preserved in matrices M 1 ,M 2 ,and M 3 if  X  =3.
Previous coherent subspace clustering methods focus on mining data generated under homogeneous settings. Our model, on the other hand, can be applied to microarray data collected from heterogeneous settings. Since experi-mental settings used in different microarray techniques and the samples may be different and incompatible, we do not require the genes in an F-cluster have same expression pat-terns in different microarrays. As shown in Figure 1, the F-cluster { g 1 ,g 2 ,g 3 } is preserved in M 1 , M 2 ,and M rately. But the expression patterns are not preserved across matrices. (There are cross-overs between matrices as shown in Figure 1.)
Let I be the number of genes in the heterogenous microar-ray dataset, K be the number of matrices, and  X  be the user specified threshold. There can be as many as 2 I potential gene clusters in each matrix, where I typically ranges from thousands to tens of thousands. Identifying those supported by at least  X  out of K matrices requires intelligent pruning strategies to confine the search space.
F-clusters can be viewed as consensus subspace clusters in multiple microarray matrices. To mine the F-clusters, in a straightforward manner, we can adopt the following 2-step approach.
This na  X   X ve approach is inefficient, since there are usually thousands to millions of subspace clusters (even if we only keep maximal subspace clusters) in a single matrix.
In this paper, we propose F-cluster model for mining co-herent subspace clusters. This model can find the clusters that are preserved in expression data generated by different microarray techniques. We compare our model with previ-ous models and propose a straightforward method to mine the F-clusters. In our future work, we shall develop more efficient algorithm for this problem. The algorithm should adopt efficient search strategy and incorporate effective pun-ning methods. We will apply our mining algorithm to real life gene expression datasets and validate the biological sig-nificance of the resulting gene clusters. [1] V. Detours, J.E. Dumont, H. Bersini and C.
