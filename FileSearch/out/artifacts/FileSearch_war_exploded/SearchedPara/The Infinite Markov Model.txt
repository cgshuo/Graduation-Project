 sequences will have heterogeneous Markov dependencies, we want a Markov model that deploys 3.1 Introducing Suffix Tree Prior For this purpose, we assume that each node i in the suffix tree has a hidden probability q We assume that each q mance does not significantly depend on  X  or  X  .
 When we want to generate a symbol s tree from the root following a path s level l given by When we stop at level l , we generate a symbol s from node to node, we may reach very deep nodes with high proba bility if the q if the q of typical phrases.

In our case, we only explicitly resample n Notice here that when we sample n where a probability of (5) as The first term is the probability of s given by (1). The second term is the prior probability of reac hing that node at depth n (6) and (3), this probability is given by Expression (7) is a tradeoff between these two terms: the pre diction of s when the context length n that level in the suffix tree is supported by the other counts i n the training data. of order[ t ] in the suffix tree, and decrement a as order[ t ], and increment a is implicitly sampled because s table is needed to sit him down. 1: for j = 1  X  X  X  N do 2: for t = randperm(1  X  X  X  T ) do 3: if j &gt; 1 then 4: remove customer (order[ t ], s t , s 1: t 5: end if 6: order[ t ] = add customer ( s t , s 1: t 7: end for 8: end for eliminate the order from Markov models by integrating it out .

 introducing an auxiliary probability p ( s | h, n + ) as follows: This formula shows that q rescale it to make p ( n | h ) a proper distribution. 3.4  X  X tochastic Phrases X  on Suffix Tree subsequence s to this subsequence, which represents its cohesion strengt h irrespective of its length. the context s concrete examples, see Figure 8 and 10 in Section 4. and word sequences in natural language. 4.1 Infinite character Markov model uniform Beta prior and truncation threshold  X  = 0 . 0001 in Section 3.2.
