 Verb classifications have been shown to be useful both from a theoretical and from a practical perspec-tive. From the theoretical viewpoint, they permit capturing syntactic and/or semantic generalisations about verbs (Levin, 1993; Kipper Schuler, 2006). From a practical perspective, they support factorisa-tion and have been shown to be effective in various NLP (Natural language Processing) tasks such as se-mantic role labelling (Swier and Stevenson, 2005) or word sense disambiguation (Dang, 2004).

While there has been much work on automatically acquiring verb classes for English (Sun et al., 2010) and to a lesser extent for German (Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Schulte im Walde, 2003; Schulte im Walde, 2006), Japanese (Oishi and Matsumoto, 1997) and Italian (Merlo et al., 2002), few studies have been conducted on the automatic classification of French verbs. Recently however, two proposals have been put forward.

On the one hand, (Sun et al., 2010) applied a clustering approach developed for English to French. They exploit features extracted from a large scale subcategorisation lexicon (LexSchem (Mes-siant, 2008)) acquired fully automatically from Le Monde newspaper corpus and show that, as for En-glish, syntactic frames and verb selectional prefer-ences perform better than lexical cooccurence fea-tures. Their approach achieves a F-measure of 55.1 on 116 verbs occurring at least 150 times in Lexschem. The best performance is achieved when restricting the approach to verbs occurring at least 4000 times (43 verbs) with an F-measure of 65.4.
On the other hand, Falk and Gardent (2011) present a classification approach for French verbs based on the use of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). FCA (Barbut and Monjardet, 1970) is a sym-bolic classification technique which permits creating classes associating sets of objects (eg. French verbs) with sets of features (eg. syntactic frames). Falk and Gardent (2011) provide no evaluation for their results however, only a qualitative analysis.
In this paper, we describe a novel approach to the clustering of French verbs which (i) gives good re-sults on the established benchmark used in (Sun et al., 2010) and (ii) associates verbs with a feature profile describing their syntactic and semantic prop-erties. The approach exploits a clustering method called IGNGF (Incremental Growing Neural Gas with Feature Maximisation, (Lamirel et al., 2011b)) which uses the features characterising each cluster both to guide the clustering process and to label the output clusters. We apply this method to the data contained in various verb lexicons and we evalu-ate the resulting classification on a slightly modified version of the gold standard provided by (Sun et al., 2010). We show that the approach yields promising results (F-measure of 70%) and that the clustering produced systematically associates verbs with syn-tactic frames and thematic grids thereby providing an interesting basis for the creation and evaluation of a Verbnet-like classification.

Section 2 describes the lexical resources used for feature extraction and Section 3 the experimental setup. Sections 4 and 5 present the data used for and the results obtained. Section 6 concludes. Our aim is to accquire a classification which covers the core verbs of French, could be used to support semantic role labelling and is similar in spirit to the English Verbnet. In this first experiment, we there-fore favoured extracting the features used for clus-tering, not from a large corpus parsed automatically, but from manually validated resources 1 . These lexi-cal resources are (i) a syntactic lexicon produced by merging three existing lexicons for French and (ii) the English Verbnet.
 Among the many syntactic lexicons available for French (Nicolas et al., 2008; Messiant, 2008; Kup  X  s  X  c and Abeill  X  e, 2008; van den Eynde and Mertens, 2003; Gross, 1975), we selected and merged three lexicons built or validated manually namely, Dico-valence, TreeLex and the LADL tables. The result-ing lexicon contains 5918 verbs, 20433 lexical en-tries (i.e., verb/frame pairs) and 345 subcategorisa-tion frames. It also contains more detailed syntac-tic and semantic features such as lexical preferences (e.g., locative argument, concrete object) or thematic role information (e.g., symmetric arguments, asset role) which we make use of for clustering.

We use the English Verbnet as a resource for asso-ciating French verbs with thematic grids as follows. We translate the verbs in the English Verbnet classes to French using English-French dictionaries 2 . To deal with polysemy, we train a supervised classifier as follows. We first map French verbs with English Verbnet classes: A French verb is associated with an English Verbnet class if, according to our dictio-naries, it is a translation of an English verb in this class. The task of the classifier is then to produce a probability estimate for the correctness of this as-sociation, given the training data. The training set is built by stating for 1740  X  French verb, English Verbnet class  X  pairs whether the verb has the the-matic grid given by the pair X  X  Verbnet class 3 . This set is used to train an SVM (support vector machine) classifier 4 . The features we use are similar to those used in (Mouton, 2010): they are numeric and are derived for example from the number of translations an English or French verb had, the size of the Verb-net classes, the number of classes a verb is a member of etc. The resulting classifier gives for each  X  French verb, English VN class  X  pair the estimated probabil-ity of the pair X  X  verb being a member of the pair X  X  class 5 . We select 6000 pairs with highest proba-bility estimates and obtain the translated classes by assigning each verb in a selected pair to the pair X  X  class. This way French verbs are effectively asso-ciated with one or more English Verbnet thematic grids. 3.1 Clustering Methods The IGNGF clustering method is an incremental neural  X  X inner-take-most X  clustering method be-longing to the family of the free topology neu-ral clustering methods. Like other neural free topology methods such as Neural Gas (NG) (Mar-tinetz and Schulten, 1991), Growing Neural Gas (GNG) (Fritzke, 1995), or Incremental Growing Neural Gas (IGNG) (Prudent and Ennaji, 2005), the IGNGF method makes use of Hebbian learning (Hebb, 1949) for dynamically structuring the learn-ing space. However, contrary to these methods, the use of a standard distance measure for determining a winner is replaced in IGNGF by feature maximisa-tion. Feature maximisation is a cluster quality metric which associates each cluster with maximal features i.e., features whose Feature F-measure is maximal. Feature F-measure is the harmonic mean of Feature Recall and Feature Precision which in turn are de-fined as: F R c ( f ) = where W f x represents the weight of the feature f for element x and F c designates the set of features as-sociated with the verbs occuring in the cluster c . A feature is then said to be maximal for a given clus-ter iff its Feature F-measure is higher for that cluster than for any other cluster.

The IGNGF method was shown to outperform other usual neural and non neural methods for clus-tering tasks on relatively clean data (Lamirel et al., 2011b). Since we use features extracted from man-ually validated sources, this clustering technique seems a good fit for our application. In addition, the feature maximisation and cluster labeling per-formed by the IGNGF method has proved promising both for visualising clustering results (Lamirel et al., 2008) and for validating or optimising a clustering method (Attik et al., 2006). We make use of these processes in all our experiments and systematically compute cluster labelling and feature maximisation on the output clusterings. As we shall see, this per-mits distinguishing between clusterings with simi-lar F-measure but lower  X  X inguistic plausibility X  (cf. Section 5). This facilitates clustering interpretation in that cluster labeling clearly indicates the associa-tion between clusters (verbs) and their prevalent fea-tures. And this supports the creation of a Verbnet style classification in that cluster labeling directly provides classes grouping together verbs, thematic grids and subcategorisation frames. 3.2 Evaluation metrics We use several evaluation metrics which bear on dif-ferent properties of the clustering.
 Modified Purity and Accuracy. Following (Sun et al., 2010), we use modified purity (mPUR); weighted class accuracy (ACC) and F-measure to evaluate the clusterings produced. These are com-puted as follows. Each induced cluster is assigned the gold class (its prevalent class , prev ( C ) ) to which most of its member verbs belong. A verb is then said to be correct if the gold associates it with the preva-lent class of the cluster it is in. Given this, purity is the ratio between the number of correct gold verbs in the clustering and the total number of gold verbs in the clustering 6 : mP U R = verbs in the clustering.

Accuracy represents the proportion of gold verbs in those clusters which are associated with a gold class, compared to all the gold verbs in the clus-tering. To compute accuracy we associate to each gold class C Gold a dominant cluster, ie. the cluster dom ( C Gold ) which has most verbs in common with the gold class. Then accuracy is given by the follow-ing formula: Finally, F-measure is the harmonic mean of mPUR and ACC.
 Coverage. To assess the extent to which a cluster-ing matches the gold classification, we additionally compute the coverage of each clustering that is, the proportion of gold classes that are prevalent classes in the clustering.
 Cumulative Micro Precision (CMP). As pointed out in (Lamirel et al., 2008; Attik et al., 2006), un-supervised evaluation metrics based on cluster la-belling and feature maximisation can prove very useful for identifying the best clustering strategy. Following (Lamirel et al., 2011a), we use CMP to identify the best clustering. Computed on the clus-tering results, this metrics evaluates the quality of a clustering w.r.t. the cluster features rather than w.r.t. to a gold standard. It was shown in (Ghribi et al., 2010) to be effective in detecting degenerated clus-tering results including a small number of large het-erogeneous,  X  X arbage X  clusters and a big number of small size  X  X hunk X  clusters.

First, the local Recall ( R f c ) and the local Preci-sion ( P f c ) of a feature f in a cluster c are defined as follows: where v f c is the set of verbs having feature f in c , V the set of verbs in c and V f , the set of verbs with feature f .

Cumulative Micro-Precision (CMP) is then de-fined as follows: CM P = where C i + represents the subset of clusters of C for which the number of associated verbs is greater than i , and: C inf = argmin c argmax c 3.3 Cluster display, feature f-Measure and To facilitate interpretation, clusters are displayed as illustrated in Table 1. Features are displayed in decreasing order of Feature F-measure (cf. Sec-tion 3.1) and features whose Feature F-measure is under the average Feature F-measure of the over-all clustering are clearly delineated from others. In addition, for each verb in a cluster, a confidence score is displayed which is the ratio between the sum of the F-measures of its cluster maximised features over the sum of the F-measures of the overall cluster maximised features. Verbs whose confidence score is 0 are considered as orphan data. 3.4 Experimental setup We applied an IDF-Norm weighting scheme (Robertson and Jones, 1976) to decrease the influ-ence of the most frequent features (IDF component) and to compensate for discrepancies in feature num-ber (normalisation).

We use K-Means as a baseline. For each cluster-ing method (K-Means and IGNGF), we let the num-ber of clusters vary between 1 and 30 to obtain a partition that reaches an optimum F-measure and a number of clusters that is in the same order of mag-nitude as the initial number of Gold classes (i.e. 11 classes). Features In the simplest case the features are the subcategorisation frames ( scf ) associated to the verbs by our lexicon. We also experiment with dif-ferent combinations of additional, syntactic ( synt ) and semantic features ( sem ) extracted from the lex-icon and with the thematic grids ( grid ) extracted from the English Verbnet.
 The thematic grid information is derived from the English Verbnet as explained in Section 2. The syn-tactic features extracted from the lexicon are listed in Table 1(a). They indicate whether a verb accepts symmetric arguments (e.g., John met Mary/John and Mary met ); has four or more arguments; combines with a predicative phrase (e.g., John named Mary president ); takes a sentential complement or an op-tional object; or accepts the passive in se (similar to the English middle voice Les habits se vendent bien / The clothes sell well ). As shown in Table 1(a), these features are meant to help identify specific Verbnet classes and thematic roles. Finally, we extract four semantic features from the lexicon. These indicate whether a verb takes a locative or an asset argument and whether it requires a concrete object (non hu-man role) or a plural role. The potential correlation between these features and Verbnet classes is given in Table 1(b).
 French Gold Standard To evaluate our approach, we use the gold standard proposed by Sun et al. (2010). This resource consists of 16 fine grained Levin classes with 12 verbs each whose predomi-nant sense in English belong to that class. Since our goal is to build a Verbnet like classification for French, we mapped the 16 Levin classes of the Sun et al. (2010) X  X  Gold Standard to 11 Verbnet classes thereby associating each class with a the-matic grid. In addition we group Verbnet semantic roles as shown in Table 4. Table 3 shows the refer-ence we use for evaluation.
 Verbs For our clustering experiments we use the 2183 French verbs occurring in the translations of the 11 classes in the gold standard (cf. Section 4). Since we ignore verbs with only one feature the number of verbs and  X  verb, feature  X  pairs considered may vary slightly across experiments.
 5.1 Quantitative Analysis Table 4(a) includes the evaluation results for all the feature sets when using IGNGF clustering.

In terms of F-measure, the results range from 0.61 to 0.70. This generally outperforms (Sun et al., 2010) whose best F-measures vary between 0.55 for verbs occurring at least 150 times in the training data and 0.65 for verbs occurring at least 4000 times in this training data. The results are not directly com-parable however since the gold data is slightly dif-ferent due to the grouping of Verbnet classes through their thematic grids.

In terms of features, the best results are ob-tained using the grid-scf-sem feature set with an F-measure of 0.70. Moreover, for this data set, the un-supervised evaluation metrics (cf. Section 3) high-light strong cluster cohesion with a number of clus-ters close to the number of gold classes (13 clusters for 11 gold classes); a low number of orphan verbs (i.e., verbs whose confidence score is zero); and a high Cumulated Micro Precision (CMP = 0.3) indi-cating homogeneous clusters in terms of maximis-ing features. The coverage of 0.72 indicates that ap-proximately 8 out of the 11 gold classes could be matched to a prevalent label. That is, 8 clusters were labelled with a prevalent label corresponding to 8 distinct gold classes.

In contrast, the classification obtained using the scf-synt-sem feature set has a higher CMP for the clustering with optimal mPUR (0.57); but a lower F-measure (0.61), a larger number of classes (16) and a higher number of orphans (156). That is, this clustering has many clusters with strong feature co-hesion but a class structure that markedly differs from the gold. Since there might be differences in structure between the English Verbnet and the the-matic classification for French we are building, this is not necessarily incorrect however. Further inves-tigation on a larger data set would be required to as-sess which clustering is in fact better given the data used and the classification searched for.

In general, data sets whose description includes semantic features ( sem or grid ) tend to produce bet-ter results than those that do not ( scf or synt ). This is in line with results from (Sun et al., 2010) which shows that semantic features help verb classifica-tion. It differs from it however in that the seman-tic features used by Sun et al. (2010) are selectional preferences while ours are thematic grids and a re-stricted set of manually encoded selectional prefer-ences.

Noticeably, the synt feature degrades perfor-mance throughout: grid,scf,synt has lower F-measure than grid,scf ; scf,synt,sem than scf,sem ; and scf,synt than scf . We have no clear explanation for this.

The best results are obtained with IGNGF method on most of the data sets. Table 4(b) illustrates the differences between the results obtained with IGNGF and those obtained with K-means on the grid-scf-sem data set (best data set). Although K-means and IGNGF optimal model reach similar F-measure and display a similar number of clusters, the very low CMP (0.10) of the K-means model shows that, despite a good Gold class coverage (0.81), K-means tend to produce more heteroge-neous clusters in terms of features.

Table 4(b) also shows the impact of IDF feature weighting and feature vector normalisation on clus-tering. The benefit of preprocessing the data appears clearly. When neither IDF weighting nor vector nor-malisation are used, F-measure decreases from 0.70 to 0.68 and cumulative micro-precision from 0.30 to 0.21. When either normalisation or IDF weight-ing is left out, the cumulative micro-precision drops by up to 15 points (from 0.30 to 0.15 and 0.18) and the number of orphans increases from 67 up to 180. That is, clusters are less coherent in terms of fea-tures. 5.2 Qualitative Analysis We carried out a manual analysis of the clusters ex-amining both the semantic coherence of each cluster (do the verbs in that cluster share a semantic com-ponent?) and the association between the thematic grids, the verbs and the syntactic frames provided by clustering.
 Semantic homogeneity: To assess semantic ho-mogeneity, we examined each cluster and sought to identify one or more Verbnet labels character-ising the verbs contained in that cluster. From the 13 clusters produced by clustering, 11 clus-ters could be labelled. Table 6 shows these eleven clusters, the associated labels (abbreviated Verbnet class names), some example verbs, a sample sub-categorisation frame drawn from the cluster max-imising features and an illustrating sentence. As can be seen, some clusters group together several subclasses and conversely, some Verbnet classes are spread over several clusters. This is not necessar-ily incorrect though. To start with, recall that we are aiming for a classification which groups together verbs with the same thematic grid. Given this, clus-ter C2 correctly groups together two Verbnet classes (other cos-45.4 and hit-18.1) which share the same thematic grid (cf. Table 3). In addition, the features associated with this cluster indicate that verbs in these two classes are transitive, select a concrete ob-ject, and can be pronominalised which again is cor-rect for most verbs in that cluster. Similarly, cluster C11 groups together verbs from two Verbnet classes with identical theta grid (light emission-43.1 and modes of being with motion-47.3) while its associ-ated features correctly indicate that verbs from both classes accept both the intransitive form without ob-ject ( la jeune fille rayonne / the young girl glows, un cheval galope / a horse gallops ) and with a prepo-sitional object ( la jeune fille rayonne de bonheur / the young girl glows with happiness, un cheval ga-lope vers l X  X nfini / a horse gallops to infinity ). The third cluster grouping together verbs from two Verb-net classes is C7 which contains mainly judgement verbs (to applaud, bless, compliment, punish) but also some verbs from the (very large) other cos-45.4 class. In this case, a prevalent shared feature is that both types of verbs accept a de-object that is, a prepositional object introduced by  X  X e X  ( Jean ap-plaudit Marie d X  X voir dans  X  e / Jean applaudit Marie for having danced; Jean d  X  egage le sable de la route / Jean clears the sand of the road ). The semantic fea-tures necessary to provide a finer grained analysis of their differences are lacking.

Interestingly, clustering also highlights classes which are semantically homogeneous but syntac-tically distinct. While clusters C6 and C10 both contain mostly verbs from the amuse-31.1 class ( amuser,agacer,  X  enerver,d  X  eprimer ), their features in-dicate that verbs in C10 accept the pronominal form (e.g., Jean s X  X muse ) while verbs in C6 do not (e.g., *Jean se d  X  eprime ). In this case, clustering highlights a syntactic distinction which is present in French but not in English. In contrast, the dispersion of verbs from the other cos-45.4 class over clusters C2 and C7 has no obvious explanation. One reason might be that this class is rather large (361 verbs) and thus might contain French verbs that do not necessarily share properties with the original Verbnet class. Syntax and Semantics. We examined whether the prevalent syntactic features labelling each cluster were compatible with the verbs and with the seman-tic class(es) manually assigned to the clusters. Ta-ble 6 sketches the relation between cluster, syntac-tic frames and Verbnet like classes. It shows for in-stance that the prevalent frame of the C0 class (man-ner speaking-37.3) correctly indicates that verbs in that cluster subcategorise for a sentential argument and an AOBJ (prepositional object in  X  ` a X ) (e.g., Jean bafouille ` a Marie qu X  X l est amoureux / Jean stam-mers to Mary that he is in love ); and that verbs in the C9 class (characterize-29.2) subcategorise for an object NP and an attribute ( Jean nomme Marie pr  X  esidente / Jean appoints Marie president ). In gen-eral, we found that the prevalent frames associated with each cluster adequately characterise the syntax of that verb class. We presented an approach to the automatic classi-fication of french verbs which showed good results on an established testset and associates verb clusters with syntactic and semantic features.

Whether the features associated by the IGNGF clustering with the verb clusters appropriately car-acterise these clusters remains an open question. We carried out a first evaluation using these features to label the syntactic arguments of verbs in a cor-pus with thematic roles and found that precision is high but recall low mainly because of polysemy: the frames and grids made available by the classification for a given verb are correct for that verb but not for the verb sense occurring in the corpus. This sug-gests that overlapping clustering techniques need to be applied.

We are also investigating how the approach scales up to the full set of verbs present in the lexicon. Both Dicovalence and the LADL tables contain rich de-tailed information about the syntactic and semantic properties of French verbs. We intend to tap on that potential and explore how well the various semantic features that can be extracted from these resources support automatic verb classification for the full set of verbs present in our lexicon.
