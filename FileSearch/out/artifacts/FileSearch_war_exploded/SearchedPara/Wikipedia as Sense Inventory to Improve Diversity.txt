 The application of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) to Information Retrieval (IR) has been sub-ject of a significant research effort in the recent past. The essential idea is that, by indexing and matching word senses (or even meanings) , the re-trieval process could better handle polysemy and synonymy problems (Sanderson, 2000). In prac-tice, however, there are two main difficulties: (i) for long queries, IR models implicitly perform disambiguation, and thus there is little room for improvement. This is the case with most stan-dard IR benchmarks, such as TREC (trec.nist.gov) or CLEF (www.clef-campaign.org) ad-hoc collec-tions; (ii) for very short queries, disambiguation may not be possible or even desirable. This is often the case with one word and even two word queries in Web search engines.

In Web search, there are at least three ways of coping with ambiguity:  X  Promoting diversity in the search results  X  Presenting the results as a set of (labelled)  X  Complementing search results with search
All of them rely on the ability of the search en-gine to cluster search results, detecting topic simi-larities. In all of them, disambiguation is implicit, a side effect of the process but not its explicit tar-get. Clustering may detect that documents about the Oasis band and the Oasis fashion store deal with unrelated topics, but it may as well detect a group of documents discussing why one of the Oasis band members is leaving the band, and an-other group of documents about Oasis band lyrics; both are different aspects of the broad topic Oa-sis band. A perfect hierarchical clustering should distinguish between the different Oasis senses at a first level, and then discover different topics within each of the senses.

Is it possible to use sense inventories to improve search results for one word queries? To answer this question, we will focus on two broad-coverage lexical resources of a different nature: WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), as a de-facto standard used in Word Sense Disambiguation experiments and many other Natural Language Processing research fields; and Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org), as a large coverage and updated encyclopedic resource which may have a better coverage of relevant senses in Web pages.

Our hypothesis is that, under appropriate con-ditions, any of the above mechanisms (clustering, search suggestions, diversity) might benefit from an explicit disambiguation (classification of pages in the top search results) using a wide-coverage sense inventory. Our research is focused on four relevant aspects of the problem: 1. Coverage: Are Wikipedia/Wordnet senses 2. If the answer to (1) is positive, the reverse 3. Sense frequencies: knowing sense frequen-4. Classification: The association of Web pages
In order to provide an initial answer to these questions, we have built a corpus consisting of 40 nouns and 100 Google search results per noun, manually annotated with the most appropriate Wordnet and Wikipedia senses. Section 2 de-scribes how this corpus has been created, and in Section 3 we discuss WordNet and Wikipedia cov-erage of search results according to our testbed. As this initial results clearly discard Wordnet as a sense inventory for the task, the rest of the pa-per mainly focuses on Wikipedia. In Section 4 we estimate search results diversity from our testbed, finding that the use of Wikipedia could substan-tially improve diversity in the top results. In Sec-tion 5 we use the Wikipedia internal link structure and the number of visits per page to estimate rel-ative frequencies for Wikipedia senses, obtaining an estimation which is highly correlated with ac-tual data in our testbed. Finally, in Section 6 we discuss a few strategies to classify Web pages into word senses, and apply the best classifier to en-hance diversity in search results. The paper con-cludes with a discussion of related work (Section 7) and an overall discussion of our results in Sec-tion 8. 2.1 Set of Words The most crucial step in building our test set is choosing the set of words to be considered. We are looking for words which are susceptible to form a one-word query for a Web search engine, and therefore we should focus on nouns which are used to denote one or more named entities. At the same time we want to have some degree of comparability with previous research on Word Sense Disambiguation, which points to noun sets used in Senseval/SemEval evaluation campaigns 1 . Our budget for corpus annotation was enough for two persons-month, which limited us to handle 40 nouns (usually enough to establish statistically significant differences between WSD algorithms, although obviously limited to reach solid figures about the general behaviour of words in the Web).
With these arguments in mind, we decided to choose: (i) 15 nouns from the Senseval-3 lexi-cal sample dataset, which have been previously employed by (Mihalcea, 2007) in a related ex-periment (see Section 7); (ii) 25 additional words which satisfy two conditions: they are all am-biguous, and they are all names for music bands in one of their senses (not necessarily the most salient). The Senseval set is: { argument, arm, atmosphere, bank, degree, difference, disc, im-age, paper, party, performance, plan, shelter, sort, source } . The bands set is { amazon, apple, camel, cell, columbia, cream, foreigner, fox, gen-esis, jaguar, oasis, pioneer, police, puma, rain-bow, shell, skin, sun, tesla, thunder, total, traffic, trapeze, triumph, yes } .

For each noun, we looked up all its possible senses in WordNet 3.0 and in Wikipedia (using Wikipedia disambiguation pages). Wikipedia has an average of 22 senses per noun (25.2 in the Bands set and 16.1 in the Senseval set), and Word-net a much smaller figure, 4.5 (3.12 for the Bands set and 6.13 for the Senseval set). For a conven-tional dictionary, a higher ambiguity might indi-cate an excess of granularity; for an encyclopaedic resource such as Wikipedia, however, it is just an indication of larger coverage. Wikipedia en-tries for camel which are not in WordNet, for in-stance, include the Apache Camel routing and me-diation engine, the British rock band, the brand of cigarettes, the river in Cornwall, and the World World War I fighter biplane. 2.2 Set of Documents We retrieved the 150 first ranked documents for each noun, by submitting the nouns as queries to a Web search engine (Google). Then, for each doc-ument, we stored both the snippet (small descrip-tion of the contents of retrieved document) and the whole HTML document. This collection of docu-ments contain an implicit new inventory of senses, based on Web search, as documents retrieved by a noun query are associated with some sense of the noun. Given that every document in the top Web search results is supposed to be highly rele-vant for the query word, we assume a  X  X ne sense per document X  scenario, although we allow an-notators to assign more than one sense per doc-ument. In general this assumption turned out to be correct except in a few exceptional cases (such as Wikipedia disambiguation pages): only nine docu-ments received more than one WordNet sense, and 44 (1.1% of all annotated pages) received more than one Wikipedia sense. 2.3 Manual Annotation We implemented an annotation interface which stored all documents and a short description for every Wordnet and Wikipedia sense. The annota-tors had to decide, for every document, whether there was one or more appropriate senses in each of the dictionaries. They were instructed to pro-vide annotations for 100 documents per name; if an URL in the list was corrupt or not available, it had to be discarded. We provided 150 docu-ments per name to ensure that the figure of 100 us-able documents per name could be reached with-out problems.

Each judge provided annotations for the 4,000 documents in the final data set. In a second round, they met and discussed their independent annota-tions together, reaching a consensus judgement for every document. Table 1 shows how Wikipedia and Wordnet cover the senses in search results. We report each noun subset separately ( Senseval and bands subsets) as well as aggregated figures.
 The most relevant fact is that, unsurprisingly, Wikipedia senses cover much more search results (56%) than Wordnet (32%). If we focus on the top ten results, in the bands subset (which should be more representative of plausible web queries) Wikipedia covers 68% of the top ten documents. This is an indication that it can indeed be useful for promoting diversity or help clustering search results: even if 32% of the top ten documents are not covered by Wikipedia, it is still a representa-tive source of senses in the top search results.
We have manually examined all documents in the top ten results that are not covered by Wikipedia: a majority of the missing senses con-sists of names of (generally not well-known) com-panies (45%) and products or services (26%); the other frequent type (12%) of non annotated doc-ument is disambiguation pages (from Wikipedia and also from other dictionaries).

It is also interesting to examine the degree of overlap between Wikipedia and Wordnet senses. Being two different types of lexical resource, they might have some degree of complementar-ity. Table 2 shows, however, that this is not the case: most of the (annotated) documents either fit Wikipedia senses (26%) or both Wikipedia and Wordnet (29%), and just 3% fit Wordnet only. Therefore, Wikipedia seems to extend the cover-age of Wordnet rather than providing complemen-tary sense information. If we wanted to extend the coverage of Wikipedia, the best strategy seems to be to consider lists of companies, products and ser-vices, rather than complementing Wikipedia with additional sense inventories. Once we know that Wikipedia senses are a rep-resentative subset of actual Web senses (covering more than half of the documents retrieved by the search engine), we can test how well search results respect diversity in terms of this subset of senses.
Table 3 displays the number of different senses found at different depths in the search results rank, and the average proportion of total senses that they represent. These results suggest that diversity is not a major priority for ranking results: the top ten results only cover, in average, 3 Wikipedia senses (while the average number of senses listed in Wikipedia is 22). When considering the first 100 documents, this number grows up to 6.85 senses per noun.

Another relevant figure is the frequency of the most frequent sense for each word: in average, 63% of the pages in search results belong to the most frequent sense of the query word. This is roughly comparable with most frequent sense fig-ures in standard annotated corpora such as Sem-cor (Miller et al., 1993) and the Senseval/Semeval data sets, which suggests that diversity may not play a major role in the current Google ranking al-gorithm.

Of course this result must be taken with care, because variability between words is high and un-predictable, and we are using only 40 nouns for our experiment. But what we have is a positive indication that Wikipedia could be used to im-prove diversity or cluster search results: poten-tially the first top ten results could cover 6.15 dif-ferent senses in average (see Section 6.5), which would be a substantial growth. Wikipedia disambiguation pages contain no sys-tematic information about the relative importance of senses for a given word. Such information, however, is crucial in a lexicon, because sense dis-tributions tend to be skewed, and knowing them can help disambiguation algorithms.

We have attempted to use two estimators of ex-pected sense distribution:  X  Internal relevance of a word sense, measured  X  External relevance of a word sense, measured
The number of internal incoming links is ex-pected to be relatively stable for Wikipedia arti-cles. As for the number of visits, we performed a comparison of the number of visits received by the bands noun subset in May, June and July 2009, finding a stable-enough scenario with one notori-ous exception: the number of visits to the noun Tesla raised dramatically in July, because July 10 was the anniversary of the birth of Nicola Tesla, and a special Google logo directed users to the Wikipedia page for the scientist.

We have measured correlation between the rela-tive frequencies derived from these two indicators and the actual relative frequencies in our testbed. Therefore, for each noun w and for each sense w i , we consider three values: (i) proportion of doc-uments retrieved for w which are manually as-signed to each sense w i ; (ii) inlinks ( w i ) : rela-tive amount of incoming links to each sense w i ; and (iii) visits ( w i ) : relative number of visits to the URL for each sense w i .

We have measured the correlation between these three values using a linear regression corre-lation coefficient, which gives a correlation value of . 54 for the number of visits and of . 71 for the number of incoming links. Both estimators seem to be positively correlated with real relative fre-quencies in our testbed, with a strong preference for the number of links.

We have experimented with weighted combina-tions of both indicators, using weights of the form ( k, 1  X  k ) ,k  X  X  0 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 2 ... 1 } , reaching a max-imal correlation of . 73 for the following weights: freq ( w i ) = 0 . 9  X  inlinks ( w i )+0 . 1  X  visits ( w
This weighted estimator provides a slight ad-vantage over the use of incoming links only ( . 73 vs . 71 ). Overall, we have an estimator which has a strong correlation with the distribution of senses in our testbed. In the next section we will test its utility for disambiguation purposes. We want to test whether the information provided by Wikipedia can be used to classify search results accurately. Note that we do not want to consider approaches that involve a manual creation of train-ing material, because they can X  X  be used in prac-tice.

Given a Web page p returned by the search engine for the query w , and the set of senses w 1 ...w n listed in Wikipedia, the task is to assign the best candidate sense to p . We consider two different techniques:  X  A basic Information Retrieval approach,  X  An approach based on a state-of-the-art su-
We also compute two baselines:  X  A random assignment of senses (precision is  X  A most frequent sense heuristic which uses
Both are naive baselines, but it must be noted that the most frequent sense heuristic is usually hard to beat for unsupervised WSD algorithms in most standard data sets.

We now describe each of the two main ap-proaches in detail. 6.1 VSM Approach For each word sense, we represent its Wikipedia page in a (unigram) vector space model, assigning standard tf*idf weights to the words in the docu-ment. idf weights are computed in two different ways: 1. Experiment VSM computes inverse docu-2. Experiment VSM-GT uses the statistics pro-3. Experiment VSM-mixed combines statistics
The document p is represented in the same vec-tor space as the Wikipedia senses, and it is com-pared with each of the candidate senses w i via the cosine similarity metric (we have experimented with other similarity metrics such as  X  2 , but dif-ferences are irrelevant). The sense with the high-est similarity to p is assigned to the document. In case of ties (which are rare), we pick the first sense in the Wikipedia disambiguation page (which in practice is like a random decision, because senses in disambiguation pages do not seem to be ordered according to any clear criteria).

We have also tested a variant of this approach which uses the estimation of sense frequencies presented above: once the similarities are com-puted, we consider those cases where two or more senses have a similar score (in particular, all senses with a score greater or equal than 80% of the high-est score). In that cases, instead of using the small similarity differences to select a sense, we pick up the one which has the largest frequency according to our estimator. We have applied this strategy to the best performing system, VSM-GT, resulting in experiment VSM-GT+freq . 6.2 WSD Approach We have used TiMBL (Daelemans et al., 2001), a state-of-the-art supervised WSD system which uses Memory-Based Learning. The key, in this case, is how to extract learning examples from the Wikipedia automatically. For each word sense, we basically have three sources of examples: (i) oc-currences of the word in the Wikipedia page for the word sense; (ii) occurrences of the word in Wikipedia pages pointing to the page for the word sense; (iii) occurrences of the word in external pages linked in the Wikipedia page for the word sense.

After an initial manual inspection, we decided to discard external pages for being too noisy, and we focused on the first two options. We tried three alternatives:  X  TiMBL-core uses only the examples found  X  TiMBL-inlinks uses the examples found in  X  TiMBL-all uses both sources of examples.

In order to classify a page p with respect to the senses for a word w , we first disambiguate all oc-currences of w in the page p . Then we choose the sense which appears most frequently in the page according to TiMBL results. In case of ties we pick up the first sense listed in the Wikipedia dis-ambiguation page.

We have also experimented with a variant of the approach that uses our estimation of sense fre-quencies, similarly to what we did with the VSM approach. In this case, (i) when there is a tie be-tween two or more senses (which is much more likely than in the VSM approach), we pick up the sense with the highest frequency according to our estimator; and (ii) when no sense reaches 30% of the cases in the page to be disambiguated, we also resort to the most frequent sense heuristic (among the candidates for the page). This experiment is called TiMBL-core+freq (we discarded  X  X nlinks X  and  X  X ll X  versions because they were clearly worse than  X  X ore X ). 6.3 Classification Results Table 4 shows classification results. The accuracy of systems is reported as precision, i.e. the number of pages correctly classified divided by the total number of predictions. This is approximately the same as recall (correctly classified pages divided by total number of pages) for our systems, because the algorithms provide an answer for every page containing text (actual coverage is 94% because some pages only contain text as part of an image file such as photographs and logotypes).

Experiment Precision random .19 most frequent sense (estimation) .46 TiMBL-core .60 TiMBL-inlinks .50 TiMBL-all .58 TiMBL-core+freq .67 VSM .67 VSM-GT .68 VSM-mixed .67 VSM-GT+freq .69
All systems are significantly better than the random and most frequent sense baselines (using p &lt; 0 . 05 for a standard t-test). Overall, both ap-proaches (using TiMBL WSD machinery and us-ing VSM) lead to similar results ( . 67 vs. . 69 ), which would make VSM preferable because it is a simpler and more efficient approach. Taking a closer look at the results with TiMBL, there are a couple of interesting facts:  X  There is a substantial difference between us- X  Our estimation of sense frequencies turns
As for the experiments with VSM, the varia-tions tested do not provide substantial improve-ments to the baseline (which is . 67 ). Using idf fre-quencies obtained from the Google Terabyte cor-pus (instead of frequencies obtained from the set of retrieved documents) provides only a small im-provement (VSM-GT, . 68 ), and adding the esti-mation of sense frequencies gives another small improvement ( . 69 ). Comparing the baseline VSM with the optimal setting (VSM-GT+freq), the dif-ference is small ( . 67 vs . 69 ) but relatively robust ( p = 0 . 066 according to the t-test).

Remarkably, the use of frequency estimations is very helpful for the WSD approach but not for the SVM one, and they both end up with similar performance figures; this might indicate that using frequency estimations is only helpful up to certain precision ceiling. 6.4 Precision/Coverage Trade-off All the above experiments are done at maximal coverage, i.e., all systems assign a sense for every document in the test collection (at least for every document with textual content). But it is possible to enhance search results diversity without anno-tating every document (in fact, not every document can be assigned to a Wikipedia sense, as we have discussed in Section 3). Thus, it is useful to inves-tigate which is the precision/coverage trade-off in our dataset. We have experimented with the best performing system (VSM-GT+freq), introducing a similarity threshold: assignment of a document to a sense is only done if the similarity of the doc-ument to the Wikipedia page for the sense exceeds the similarity threshold.

We have computed precision and coverage for every threshold in the range [0 . 00  X  0 . 90] (beyond 0.90 coverage was null) and represented the results in Figure 1 (solid line). The graph shows that we can classify around 20% of the documents with a precision above . 90 , and around 60% of the docu-ments with a precision of . 80 .

Note that we are reporting disambiguation re-sults using a conventional WSD test set, i.e., one in which every test case (every document) has been manually assigned to some Wikipedia sense. But in our Web Search scenario, 44% of the documents were not assigned to any Wikipedia sense: in practice, our classification algorithm would have to cope with all this noise as well. Figure 1 (dotted line) shows how the preci-sion/coverage curve is affected when the algo-rithm attempts to disambiguate all documents re-trieved by Google, whether they can in fact be as-signed to a Wikipedia sense or not. At a coverage of 20%, precision drops approximately from . 90 to . 70 , and at a coverage of 60% it drops from . 80 to . 50 . We now address the question of whether this performance is good enough to improve search re-sults diversity in practice. 6.5 Using Classification to Promote Diversity We now want to estimate how the reported clas-sification accuracy may perform in practice to en-hance diversity in search results. In order to pro-vide an initial answer to this question, we have re-ranked the documents for the 40 nouns in our testbed, using our best classifier (VSM-GT+freq) and making a list of the top-ten documents with the primary criterion of maximising the number of senses represented in the set, and the secondary criterion of maximising the similarity scores of the documents to their assigned senses. The algorithm proceeds as follows: we fill each position in the rank (starting at rank 1), with the document which has the highest similarity to some of the senses which are not yet represented in the rank; once all senses are represented, we start choosing a second representative for each sense, following the same criterion. The process goes on until the first ten documents are selected.

We have also produced a number of alternative rankings for comparison purposes:  X  clustering (centroids) : this method ap-Table 5: Enhancement of Search Results Diversity rank@10 # senses coverage Original rank 2.80 49%
Wikipedia 4.75 77% clustering (centroids) 2.50 42% clustering (top ranked) 2.80 46% random 2.45 43% upper bound 6.15 97%  X  clustering (top ranked) : Applies the same  X  random : Randomly selects ten documents  X  upper bound : This is the maximal diversity
All experiments have been applied on the full set of documents in the testbed, including those which could not be annotated with any Wikipedia sense. Coverage is computed as the ratio of senses that appear in the top ten results compared to the number of senses that appear in all search results.
Results are presented in Table 5. Note that di-versity in the top ten documents increases from an average of 2.80 Wikipedia senses represented in the original search engine rank, to 4.75 in the modified rank (being 6.15 the upper bound), with the coverage of senses going from 49% to 77%. With a simple VSM algorithm, the coverage of Wikipedia senses in the top ten results is 70% larger than in the original ranking.

Using Wikipedia to enhance diversity seems to work much better than clustering: both strategies to select a representative from each cluster are un-able to improve the diversity of the original rank-ing. Note, however, that our evaluation has a bias towards using Wikipedia, because only Wikipedia senses are considered to estimate diversity. Of course our results do not imply that the Wikipedia modified rank is better than the original Google rank: there are many other factors that in-fluence the final ranking provided by a search en-gine. What our results indicate is that, with simple and efficient algorithms, Wikipedia can be used as a reference to improve search results diversity for one-word queries. Web search results clustering and diversity in search results are topics that receive an increas-ing attention from the research community. Diver-sity is used both to represent sub-themes in a broad topic, or to consider alternative interpretations for ambiguous queries (Agrawal et al., 2009), which is our interest here. Standard IR test collections do not usually consider ambiguous queries, and are thus inappropriate to test systems that promote di-versity (Sanderson, 2008); it is only recently that appropriate test collections are being built, such as (Paramita et al., 2009) for image search and (Ar-tiles et al., 2009) for person name search. We see our testbed as complementary to these ones, and expect that it can contribute to foster research on search results diversity.

To our knowledge, Wikipedia has not explicitly been used before to promote diversity in search results; but in (Gollapudi and Sharma, 2009), it is used as a gold standard to evaluate diversifica-tion algorithms: given a query with a Wikipedia disambiguation page, an algorithm is evaluated as promoting diversity when different documents in the search results are semantically similar to dif-ferent Wikipedia pages (describing the alternative senses of the query). Although semantic similarity is measured automatically in this work, our results confirm that this evaluation strategy is sound, be-cause Wikipedia senses are indeed representative of search results. (Clough et al., 2009) analyses query diversity in a Microsoft Live Search, using click entropy and query reformulation as diversity indicators. It was found that at least 9.5% -16.2% of queries could benefit from diversification, although no correla-tion was found between the number of senses of a word in Wikipedia and the indicators used to dis-cover diverse queries. This result does not discard, however, that queries where applying diversity is useful cannot benefit from Wikipedia as a sense inventory.

In the context of clustering, (Carmel et al., 2009) successfully employ Wikipedia to enhance automatic cluster labeling, finding that Wikipedia labels agree with manual labels associated by hu-mans to a cluster, much more than with signif-icant terms that are extracted directly from the text. In a similar line, both (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) and (Syed et al., 2008) provide evidence suggesting that categories of Wikipedia articles can successfully describe common con-cepts in documents.

In the field of Natural Language Processing, there has been successful attempts to connect Wikipedia entries to Wordnet senses: (Ruiz-Casado et al., 2005) reports an algorithm that provides an accuracy of 84%. (Mihalcea, 2007) uses internal Wikipedia hyperlinks to derive sense-tagged examples. But instead of using Wikipedia directly as sense inventory, Mihalcea then manu-ally maps Wikipedia senses into Wordnet senses (claiming that, at the time of writing the paper, Wikipedia did not consistently report ambiguity in disambiguation pages) and shows that a WSD system based on acquired sense-tagged examples reaches an accuracy well beyond an (informed) most frequent sense heuristic. We have investigated whether generic lexical re-sources can be used to promote diversity in Web search results for one-word, ambiguous queries. We have compared WordNet and Wikipedia and arrived to a number of conclusions: (i) unsurpris-ingly, Wikipedia has a much better coverage of senses in search results, and is therefore more ap-propriate for the task; (ii) the distribution of senses in search results can be estimated using the in-ternal graph structure of the Wikipedia and the relative number of visits received by each sense in Wikipedia, and (iii) associating Web pages to Wikipedia senses with simple and efficient algo-rithms, we can produce modified rankings that cover 70% more Wikipedia senses than the orig-inal search engine rankings.

We expect that the testbed created for this re-search will complement the -currently short -set of benchmarking test sets to explore search re-sults diversity and query ambiguity. Our testbed is publicly available for research purposes at http://nlp.uned.es.

Our results endorse further investigation on the use of Wikipedia to organize search results. Some limitations of our research, however, must be noted: (i) the nature of our testbed (with every search result manually annotated in terms of two sense inventories) makes it too small to extract solid conclusions on Web searches (ii) our work does not involve any study of diversity from the point of view of Web users (i.e. when a Web query addresses many different use needs in prac-tice); research in (Clough et al., 2009) suggests that word ambiguity in Wikipedia might not be re-lated with diversity of search needs; (iii) we have tested our classifiers with a simple re-ordering of search results to test how much diversity can be improved, but a search results ranking depends on many other factors, some of them more crucial than diversity; it remains to be tested how can we use document/Wikipedia associations to improve search results clustering (for instance, providing seeds for the clustering process) and to provide search suggestions.
