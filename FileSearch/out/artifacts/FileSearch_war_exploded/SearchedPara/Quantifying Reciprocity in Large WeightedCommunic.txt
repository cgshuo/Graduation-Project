 One of the important aspects in human relations is the reciprocity, a.k.a. mutuality. Reci-procity can be defined as the tendency towards forming mutual connections with one another by returning similar acts, such as email and phone calls. In a highly reciprocal relationship both parties share equal interest in keeping up their relationship, while in a relationship with low reciprocity, one person is much more active than the other.
It is important to understand the factors that play role in the formation of reciprocity as there exists evidence that reciprocal relationships are highly probable to persist in the future [6]. Also, [18] shows that reciprocity related behaviors provide good features for ranking and classification based methods for trust prediction. Reciprocity plays other important roles in social and communication networks. For example, if the network sup-ports a propagation process, such as spreadin g of viruses in email networks or spreading of information and ideas in social networks, then the presence of mutual links clearly speeds up the propagation. Non-existence of reciprocal links can also reveal unwanted calls and emails in spam detection.

Despite its importance, reciprocity has remained an under-explored dynamic in net-works. Most work in network science and social network analysis focus on node level degree distributions [5,10,14], communities [20,22,19], and triadic relations, such as clustering coefficients and triangle closures [12]. The study of dyadic relations [26] and the related bivariate distributions they introduce is, however, mostly overlooked, and thus is the focus of this paper. Our motivation is grouped into two topics: M1. Modeling bivariate distributions in real data: Two vital components of un-it [27]. The study of reciprocity introduces bivariate distributions, such as the distri-bution Pr( w ij ,w ji ) of edge weights on mutual edges, where association between two quantitative variables needs to be explored. A vast majority of existing work focus on univariate distributions in real data such as power-laws [8], log-normals [4], and most recently DPLNs [21], however the study of multivariate distributions has limited focus.
In addition, visualization of multivariate data in 2D is hard and often misleading due to issues regarding over-plotting. More importantly, mere visualization does not provide a compact data representation as opposed to data modeling. Summarization via aggregate functions such as the average or the median loses a lot of information and is also not representative, especially for skewed distributions as found in real data.
Models, on the other hand, provide compact data representations by capturing the anomaly detection.
 M2. A weighted approach to reciprocity: Traditional work [11] usually study reci-procity on directed, unweighted networks as a global feature which is quantified as the ratio of the number of mutual links pointing in both directions to the total number of links. Defining reciprocity in such an unweighted fashion, however, prevents under-standing the degree of reciprocity between mutual dyads. In a weighted network, even though two nodes might have mutual links between them, the skewness and the magni-tude of the weights associated with these links would contain more information about how much reciprocity is really there between these nodes. For example, in a phone call network the reciprocity between a mutual dyad where the parties make 80% -20% of their calls respectively is certainly different than that of a mutual dyad with 50% -50% share of their calls. In short, edge weights are crucial to study reciprocity as a property of each dyad rather than as a global feature of t he entire network and give more insight into the level of mutuality.

In this paper, we analyze phone call and SMS records of 1 . 87 million mobile phone users from a large city collected over six months. The data consists of over half a billion phone calls and more than 60 million SMSs exchanged. Our contributions are: 1. We observe similar bivariate distributions Pr( w ij ,w ji ) of mutual edge weights in 2. We use weighted measures of reciprocity in order to quantify the degree of recip-Bivariate Distributions in Real Data: A vast majority of existing work focus on uni-variate distributions in real data such as power-laws, Pareto distributions and so on [17]. For example, the degree distribution has been found to obey a power-law in many real graphs such as the Internet Autonomous Systems graph [10], the WWW link graph [1], and others [5,7]. Additional power laws seem to govern the popularity of posts in cita-tion networks, which drops over time, with power law exponent of -1 for paper citations and -1 . 5 for blog posts [14].

A recent comprehensive study [8] on power-l aw distributions in empirical data shows that while power-laws exist in many graphs, deviations from a pure power-law are also observed. Those deviations usually appear in the form of exponential cut-offs and log-normals. Similar deviations were also obser ved in [2] where the electric power-grid graph in a specific region in California as well as airport networks were found to exhibit power-law distributions with exponential cut-offs.

Other deviations from power-laws continue. Discrete Gaussian Exponential (DGX) [4] was shown to provide good fits to distributions in a variety of real world data sets such as the Internet click-stream data and usage data from a mobile phone operator. Most re-cently, [21] studied several phone call networks and proposed a new distribution called the Double Pareto Log-Normal (DPLN) that was used to separately model the per-user number of call partners, number of calls and number of minutes. Other related work on explaining and modeling the behaviour of phone network users include [6,9,16,23].
While univariate distributions are used to model the distribution of a specific quantity x , for example the number of calls of users, bivariate distributions are used to model the association and co-variation between two quantitative variables x 1 and x 2 . Association is based on how two variables simultaneously change together, for example the total number of calls with respect to the number of call partners of users.

Unlike univariate distributions, the multivariate distributions have mostly been stud-ied theoretically in mathematics and statistics [3]. On the other hand, analysis of es-pecially skewed multivariate distributions in real data has attracted much less focus. Existing work includes [28], which uses the bivariate log-normal distribution to de-scribe the joint distributions of flood peaks and volumes, as well as flood volumes and durations. Also, [15] studies the drought in the state of Nebraska and models the du-ration and severity, proportion and inter-arrival time, and duration and magnitude of drought with bivariate Pareto distributions.
 Reciprocity in Unweighted Networks: Previous studies usually consider reciprocity as a global metric of a given directed network where reciprocity is quantified as r = L  X  L ,the ratio of the number of mutual links L  X  pointing in both directions to the total number of links L . By definition, r = 1 for a purely bidirectional network (e.g. collaboration networks) and r = 0 for a purely unidirectional network (e.g. citation networks).
There are two issues with this definition. First, it depends on the density of the net-work; reciprocity is larger in a network with larger link density. Second, this definition treats the graph as unweighted, and thus fails to quantify the degree of reciprocity be-tween mutual dyads. [11] combines this classical definition with the network density into a single measure which tackles the first problem, however the new measure still re-mains a global, unweighted metric and does not allow to study the degree of reciprocity. In this work, we study anonymous mobile communication records of millions of users collected over a period of six months, D ecember 1, 2007 through May 31, 2008. The data set contains both phone call and SMS interactions.
 From the whole six months X  of activity, we build three networks, CALL-N, CALL-D and SMS, in which nodes represent users and directed edges represent phone call and SMS interactions between these users. CALL-N is a who-calls-whom network with edge weights denoting (1) total number of phone calls, CALL-D is the same who-calls-whom network with edge weights d enoting (2) total duration of phone calls (aggregated in minutes), and SMS is a who-texts-whom network with edge weights denoting (3) total number of SMSs. Table 1 gives the data statistics. Global unweighted reciprocity is r = 0 . 84 for CALL, and r = 0 . 24 for SMS.
 Given a network of users with mutual , weighted edges between them, say CALL-N, and given two users i and j in the network, is there a relation between the number of calls i makes to j ( w ij ) and the number of calls j makes to i ( w ji )? In this section, we want to understand the association between the weights on the reciprocal edges in hu-man communication networks and study their distribution Pr( w ij ,w ji ) across mutual dyads. Since we study the pair-wise joint distribution, the order of the weights do not matter. Thus, to ease notation, we will denote the smaller of these weights as n ST (for weight from Silent-to-Talkative) and the larger as n TS , and will study Pr( n ST ,n TS ) .
Figure 1(top-row) shows the weights n TS versus n ST for all the reciprocal edges in (from left to right) CALL-N, CALL-D, and SMS. Each dot in the plots corresponds to a pair of mutual edges. Since there could be several pairs with the same ( n ST ,n TS ) weights, the regular scatter plot of the reciprocal edge weights would result in over-plotting. Therefore, in order to make the densities of the regions clear, we show the heatmap of the scatter plots where colors represent the magnitude of volume (red means high volume and blue means low volume).

In Figure 1, we observe that most of the points are concentrated (1) around the origin and (2) along the diagonal for all three networks. Concentration around the origin, for example in CALL-N, suggests that the vast majority of people make only a few phone calls with n ST ,n TS &lt; 10 , and much fewer people make many phone calls, which points to skewness. In addition, concentration along the diagonal indicates that mutual people call each other mostly in a balanced fashion with n ST  X  n TS . Notice that similar arguments hold for CALL-D and SMS.

Even though heatmaps reveal similar patterns in all the three networks, mere visual-ization does not provide compact representations for our data. One way to go around this issue is to do data summarization. For example, Figure 1(bottom-row) shows how n TS changes with n ST on average . The least square fit of the data points in log-log scales then provides a mathematical representatio n of the data. Data summarization by means of an aggregate function such as the average, however, loses a lot of information about the actual distribution: in our example, the slope of the least square fit in CALL-N is close to 1 , which suggests that n TS is equal to n ST on average, and does not provide any information for the deviations. This issue arises mostly because aggregation by the average is not a good representative, especially for skewed distributions.

Given our observation that the distribution of reciprocal edge weights ( n ST ,n TS ) follows a similar pattern across all three networks, how can we model the observed distributions? Since neither visualization nor aggregation qualify for compact data rep-resentation, we propose to formulate the distributions with the following bivariate func-tional form Pr( n ST ,n TS ) , which we call the Triple Power-Law (3PL) function. Proposed Model 1 (Triple Power-Law (3PL)). In human communication networks, the distribution Pr( n ST ,n TS ) of mutual edge weights n ST and n TS ( n ST being the smaller) follows a Triple Power-Law in the following form where Z is the normalization constant and M is a very large integer.
 Next we elaborate on the intuition behind the exponents  X  ,  X  and  X  . Intuition behind the  X  Exponent: 3PL is the 2D extension of the  X  X ich-get-richer X  phenomenon; people who make many phone calls will continue making even more, and even longer ones, leading to skewed, power-law-like distributions. The  X  exponent is the skewness of the main component, the number n TS of phone-calls from  X  X alkative X  to  X  X ilent X . High  X  means more skewed distribution;  X  =0 is roughly uniform distribution. As we show in Figure 1, there are many people who make only a few (and short) phone calls and only a few people who make many (and long) phone calls. Visually, the vast majority of people who make only a few phone calls are represented with the high density (dark red) regions around the origin in all three networks.
 Intuition behind the  X  Exponent: Similarly, this indicates the skewness for n ST ,the number of silent-to-talkative phone-calls. High value of  X  means high skewness, while  X  close to zero means uniformity. Notice that  X   X  0 for our real phone-call datasets (see Figure 2).
 Intuition behind the  X  Exponent: It captures the skewness in asymmetry. High  X  means that large asymmetries are improbable. This is the case in all our real datasets. For example, in addition to the origin in Figure 1(a), the regions along the diagonal also have high densities. These regions co rrespond to mutual pairs with about equal interaction in both directions. This suggests that humans tend to reciprocate their com-munications. 3PL also captures this observation; notice that the probability is higher for n TS close to n ST and drops for larger inequality ( n TS  X  n ST ) as a power-law with exponent  X  . 4.1 Comparison of 3PL to Competing Models In this section, we compare our model with two well-known parametric distributions for skewed bivariate data, the Bivariate Pareto [13] and the Bivariate Yule [25]. Their functional forms are given as two alternative competitor models as follows. Competitor Model 1 (Bivariate Pareto) We use maximum likelihood estimation to fit the parameters of each model for each of our three networks. In Figure 2, we report the best-fit parameters as well as the corre-sponding data log likelihood scores (the higher, the better). Notice that for CALL-N and CALL-D the 3PL achieves higher data likelihood than both Bivariate Pareto and Bi-variate Yule. On the other hand, for SMS, the data likelihood scores of all three models are about the same; with Bivariate Pareto giving a slightly higher score.

The simple sign of the difference between the log likelihoods (log likelihood ratio R ), however, does not on its own show conclusively that one distribution is better than the other as it is subject to statistical fluctuation. If its true value over many independent data sets drawn from the same distribution is close to zero, then the fluctuations can easily change its sign and thus the results of the comparison cannot be trusted. In order to make a firm judgement in favor of 3PL, we need to show that the difference between the log likelihoods is sufficiently large and that it could not be the result of a chance fluctuation. To do so, we need to know the standard deviation  X  on R , which we estimate from our data using the method proposed in [24].

Note that the number of mutual edge pairs n in SMS (  X  1 million) is much smaller compared to that of the call networks (  X  21 million) (Table 1). It is worth emphasizing that difference, because the biv ariate pattern of reciprocity might reveal itself better in larger data sets, and it would be interesting to see whether 3PL provides a better fit for SMS when more data samples become available.

Next, we demonstrate also visually that 3PL provides a better fit to the real data than its competitors. To this end, having estimated the model parameters for all three models, we generated synthetic data sets with the same number of samples as in each of our networks. We show the corresponding plots for CALL-N in Figure 3 (a) for real and strength of mutual relations in weighted human communication networks. Our main contributions and findings are the following:  X  New model (3PL) for the joint pdf Pr( w ij , w ji ) : We propose the Triple Power  X  3PL at work: 3PL provides a compact as well as a sparse data representation with  X  Weighted reciprocity: Lastly, we take a weighted network approach and use Acknowledgements.
