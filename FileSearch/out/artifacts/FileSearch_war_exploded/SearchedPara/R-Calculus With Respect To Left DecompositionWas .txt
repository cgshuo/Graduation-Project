When  X  contains something that is not atomic, it would not work. As a result, with an idea to delete the requirement that  X  is a set of atoms, we want to give a new R -calculus L DL statements in  X .

A logical language of FOL contains the following symbols: where f is an n -ary function symbol; where p is an n -ary predicate symbol, and p ( t 1 ,...,t n ) is called atomic. any term t, where v x/a is an assignment such that for any variable y, denoted by | = A, if A is satisfied in any model M .
