 Trust management is a paramount issue in social networks. Existing models based on global reputation are simplistic as they do not support personalised measures for individual users. Models based on local trust propagation tend to be too subjective to be reliable as they do not consider a social network in its entirety. More importantly, neither model has taken the risk factor into the consideration of trust manage-ment. In this paper, we contribute a novel trust model that allows personalised measures to be naturally established on objective grounds through tracing credit flows within a so-cial network, where the trust between a pair of users can be derived from the credit flowing from one into the other and the relative risk disparity between them. This model uses power flows in an electrical grid as a metaphor for the credit flows in a social network and is based on the hypothesis that the credit flows in a social network are similar in nature to the power flows in an electrical grid. Experiments with a real-world dataset have proved the hypothesis and the re-sults have shown that the credit flow based trust model can derive not only personalised but also more accurate trust measures than existing models do.

Past few years have witnessed not only the wide spread of various online social networks but also the exponential growth of virtual relationships. Online social networks take various forms pertaining to how virtual relationships be-tween parties are established. A relationship could arise from online interaction, for example, one making comments on a video posted to YouTube by another, or from online transactions, for example, one purchasing an item from an-other through eBay, or from friendships inherited from the real world or encountered in the virtual world, for example, friends on Facebook.

Trust is a characteristic that lives within all of us and that fundamentally underpins a variety of activities where people share, communicate, interact, and collaborate with one an-other because taking the solution from someone else about a problem one is trying to solve or collaborate with someone on a joint task requires trust of that person. To some ex-tent, supporting group work is more a matter of trust than a technology because if one did not trust the information from one X  X  collaborators, all efforts of making the information per-fect would be in vain. Recently, trust management becomes a paramount issue in online social networks as the popula-tion of social networking users receiving critical information from or making financial transactions with their virtual re-lations has skyrocketed. In recent years, a number of trust models have been proposed and used for trust management in a variety of social networks. Depending on whether global or local metrics are used to derive trust measures, they can basically be divided into global or local models [27].
A global model adopts a unified measure of trust for all nodes in a social network. It assigns a trust score to each node and every other node in the network trusts it in a unan-imous way that is decided by the score. For example, if Alice has a higher trust score than Bob does, every other user in the network would trust Alice more than Bob. A global model can be regarded as a reputation model, where each node X  X  reputation is calculated by global metrics that are based on the entire network structure or link analysis. For example, with the PageRank algorithm [12] or its vari-ations [17], Alice would have a good reputation too if nodes l inking to her were all reputable.

In contrast, a local model uses a personalised measure of trust for every individual node in a social network. It as-signs multiple trust values to each node, one for every other node in the network, which trusts it in such a way that is decided by the corresponding trust value. For example, Alice X  X  trust value towards Carol is 0.6, while Bob X  X  trust value towards Carol is 0.1, indicating that Alice trusts Carol more than Bob does. To calculate the trust value for ev-ery pair of nodes in a network, trust values between directly connected nodes must be collected from users as additional input parameters and local trust metrics need to propagate these values over the network to derive the trust values be-tween indirectly connected nodes. For example, assuming propagation of trust along a path is multiplicative, if Alice X  X  trust towards Bob is 0.6 and Bob X  X  trust towards Carol is 0.5, Alice X  X  trust towards Carol may be 0 . 6  X  0 . 5 = 0 . 3.
Global trust models are suitable for social networks where explicit personal trust values for all nodes are not available, but interactions between nodes can be used to infer the over-all reputation of each node. As bias is a natural property of trust, global models are simplistic and too objective be-cause they do not support personalised measures towards the same node. While local models have addressed this is-sue, they tend to be too subjective to be reliable because they do not consider a social network in its entirety and it is non-trivial to collect accurate personal trust values only based on the partial network information.

More importantly, neither model has taken the risk fac-tor, a factor that is inherently related to a user X  X  expertise in providing information to their social networking peers and consequently essential to infer the trustworthiness of that in-formation, into the consideration of trust management. For example, Alice happens to own high credit in a subject field but people who gave her credit are novices in that field. In contrast, Bob, who is in the same social network, owns rel-atively lower credit but people who gave him credit are all experts in the field. In this case, Alice may have a higher risk factor than Bob does and therefore should not necessarily be trusted more than Bob.

In this paper, we contribute a novel trust model CoreTrust (Credit Over Risk Equals Trust), which allows personalised measures to be naturally established on objective grounds through tracing credit flows within a social network, where the trust between a pair of users can be derived from the credit flowing from one into the other and the relative risk disparity between them. This model uses power flows in an electrical grid as a metaphor for the credit flows in a social network and is based on the hypothesis that the credit flows in a social network are similar in nature to the power flows in an electrical grid. Experiments with a real-world dataset have proved the hypothesis and the results have shown that this model can derive not only personalised but also more accurate trust measures than existing models do.

The rationale behind this model has three folds. First, a user X  X  objective reputation derived from their interactions with others in a social network in its entirety is more reli-able than a subjective trust value explicitly specified only based on partial network information. Second, since bias is a natural property of trust, it is simplistic to assign a uni-versal reputation to each user and force every one else to trust them unanimously. Last, incorporation of subjective risk assessment between users based on their expertise dis-parity into each user X  X  objective reputation is likely to yield personalized and more accurate trust measures.

The rest of this paper is organised as follows. First, we review existing trust models. Then we present the credit flow based trust model, including credit flow modelling, the CoreTrust model, and credit flow based trust inference. Af-ter that, we discuss the experimental evaluation of the model. Finally, we conclude the paper with a summary of major contributions and future work.
Social computing applications and social networking ser-vices such as Facebook and Google+ have attracted a good deal of interest over the last few years. In most social com-puting applications or services, including recommender sys-tems and social search systems, trust management is crucial for someone to determine the trustworthiness of anyone else with whom she/he will exchange information. Especially for those who do not personally know each other in the real world or have no prior direct interaction in the virtual world, trust inference is a critical approach to establishing new trust measures in a social network [8].

Trust models that calculate a universal measure of trust for all users in a social network are classified as global, as the objective of these models is to rank all nodes with a global reputation. For example, Kamvar et al. proposed the EigenTrust algorithm to calculate trust rating of each node in a network with a variation of the PageRank algo-rithm [5]. Richardson et al. described an approach that first finds all paths from a node to every other node, each of which represents an opinion of a statement, and then ag-gregates trust values along every path to calculate the final trust value [14]. Guha built a generic trust engine using the TrustRank and DistrustRank algorithms to capture the global trust rankings, which allows people to rate the con-tent and the associated ratings from others [2]. Xiong and Liu presented the PeerTrust model, where the trustworthi-ness of a peer is calculated as the average feedback weighted by the rankings of the feedback contributors [22]. The Pow-erTrust [24] and GossipTrust [25] models proposed by Zhou and Hwang used the power-law feedback characteristics and the power of gossip respectively to disseminate feedback and reputation data from which a global trustworthiness value for each peer was derived. Liu et al. described StereoTrust , which attempted to derive the expected trust by aggregating stereotypes -built on the basis of existing agents X  observed memberships of particular groups -that match an unknown agent X  X  profile [9].

In contrast, trust models that calculate personalised trust values for each user are classified as local, as these models take individual bias into account by only considering partial network information. Local trust models exploit a user X  X  personal experience and the web of trust to compute the trust value for every other user in the network. For example, J  X  sang introduced the subjective logic to assess trust values based on the triplet representation of trust [4]. Similarly, based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence and the ex-plicit notion of uncertainty [18], Yu and Singh [23] developed a heuristic discounting approach that combined the local evi-d ence with the testimonies of others evaluating the trustwor-thiness. Raph Levin X  X  Advogato project applied the network flow in graph theory to a modified graph, which composed certificates between members to determine a member X  X  trust level and their membership within a group [7]. Ziegler and Lausen presented the Appleseed algorithm for local group trust computation, which was inspired by propagation of ac-tivation over a network like neurons in psychology [26]. Gol-beck proposed the TidalTrust model to infer trust values in continuous trust networks. When a node wants to infer the trust rating of a sink node, it first asks its trusted neighbours for the rating of that node, and then calculates a weighted average trust rating of its neighbours to the sink node [1]. Massa and Avesani developed MoleTrust , which predicted one X  X  trust towards another by walking through the social network and propagating trust values along trust edges [11]. Figure 1: (a) objective trust inference; (b) subjec-t ive trust inference; (c) credit flow based trust infer-ence
Local trust models use personalised trust measures to ac-commodate diverse subjective views on the same node in a social network, whereas global models use an objective repu-tation to approximate how much a network as a whole trusts each of its nodes. While existing models are primarily based on either global or local trust inference, in most social net-works, both the subjective and objective properties of trust should be considered in order to infer personalised and more accurate trustworthiness of each node. The novelty of the CoreTrust model is to propagate trust within a social net-work in the form of credit flows. Suppose A, B, and C are three nodes in a social network. A would trust B if credit flowed from A to B, e.g., when A gave credit to B through good ratings or positive comments. If C X  X  risk factor were lower than B X  X , e.g., because C is an expert, whereas B is a novice in a subject field, A would probably trust C more than B. Therefore the trust is decided by the credit flow and the risk disparity between B and C. A node would be more trustworthy if more credit flowed into that node or that node had a lower risk factor.

Figure 1 compares the differences among objective, sub-jective, and credit flow based trust inferences. Figure 1(a) describes the acquisition of objective metrics using an al-gorithm similar to PageRank. A node X  X  PageRank value, shown as a number within the node, can be obtained through voting, where a vote is a trust link from any other node to this node (the damping factor is set to 0.85). Figure 1(b) il-lustrates the propagation of subjective metrics using a strat-egy where the trust value between a pair of indirectly con-nected nodes can be calculated from existing trust values be-tween directly connected nodes. In this example, the trust value from node A to node D, shown as a dashed edge, is derived from existing metrics: 0 . 4  X  0 . 6 + 0 . 1  X  0 . 3 = 0 . 27.
Figure 1(c) depicts the inference of trust values through tracing credit flows. A node X  X  risk factor, e.g. 1.0 for node A and 0.9 for node B (relative to A), is derived from the expertise level of that node against that of another node it is compared to. Assume node B X  X  credit is 0.1 and credit can only flow from node A to other nodes. An expected trust inference could be that credit sourced from A is 3.2 (1.8 + 1.5 -0.1), with 1.65 and 1.55 flowing into C and D respectively and that C X  X  and D X  X  risk factors (relative to A) are 0.86 and 0.87 respectively and that trust values from A and 1.78 (1 . 55 / 0 . 87) respectively.
It is essential for a credit flow model to be established on a solid mathematical and/or physical foundation so that it can be properly evaluated. The direction of a credit flow determines the trust relationship, e.g., if a credit flow is from user A to user B, A would trust B, but not vice versa. Risk disparity determines the credit flow direction, i.e., a credit flow is always from a user of high risk into a user of low risk. Risk factor is determined by expertise level, e.g., a user with a high expertise level would have a low risk factor. Risk factor is also relative in that a user X  X  risk factor is relative to the risk factor of the user to be compared to. A metaphorical relationship among credit, risk, and trust would be credit = risk  X  trust , where high credit or low risk infers high trust.
Based on the requirement analysis of the expected credit flow model, we decide to use the power flow model for an electrical grid as a metaphor to present our solution because we conjecture that the credit flows in a social network are similar in nature to the power flows in an electrical grid. An electrical grid is a network of electrical components that supply, transmit and consume electrical power. All power systems have three major types of components: generator devices that supply electrical power, load devices that con-sume electrical power, and transmission/distribution devices that transmit electrical power from generator devices to load d evices. Each power system has one or more sources of power and the sources are connected to the loads via conductors such as transmission lines. For instance, Figure 2 shows a simplistic power system consisting of 5 buses, 7 transmission lines, 2 generators, and 3 loads.
I f a load device contains inductance or capacitance that can store electrical energy, the energy will periodically return into the power source and will flow back and forth across the conductors, generating reactive power, which is opposite to the real (or active) power provided for the load device to do useful work, e.g. lighting a bulb.

If an electrical grid X  X  network structure and all its con-stituent devices X  impedances and loads are known, we can use Kirchhoff X  X  circuit law to solve all the currents in the grid with the following basic node equation: where V is the vector of voltages at all nodes, I is the vector of currents injected at all node buses, and Y bus is the nodal admittance of the buses in the system. However, because loads in an electrical grid are specified in terms of real and reactive powers instead of currents, we cannot directly use the node equations that rely on the voltages at all nodes and the currents injected at all node buses, but the power balance equations that are based on voltages, real powers, and reactive powers, such as: where N is the total number of nodes in the grid, P i and Q are per-unit real and reactive powers at node i respectively, V i is the complex conjugate of the per-unit voltage at node i , V k is the per-unit voltage at node K , and Y ik is the total admittance between nodes i and k , which can be found from the nodal admittance matrix of the buses in the grid. Given a reference node, the admittance matrix is built according to the following two rules: (1) the admittance of elements connected between node k and the reference node is added to entry ( k, k ) of the admittance matrix, and (2) the admittance of elements connected between nodes i and k is added to entries ( i, i ) and ( k, k ) of the admittance matrix, while the negative admittance is added to entries ( i, k ) and ( k, i ) of the admittance matrix.

In reality, not all variables in a power balance equation are known; therefore such an algebraic non-linear equation needs to be transformed into a sequence of linear equations whose solutions approach the solution of the original equation. This is referred to as load flow analysis [16], which can be used to analyse the system performance in normal steady-state operation by calculating the voltage drop on each feeder, the voltage at each bus, and the power flow in each branch and feeder circuit. There are several methods for solving the nonlinear power balance equations. The Newton-Raphson method is widely used in load flow analysis, which is known for its convergence characteristics and speed.

Identification of the known and unknown variables from the types of buses they are associated with is the first step and also a key to solving power balance equations. The buses in an electrical grid are classified into three types: load bus -a bus without any generator device connected to it, generator bus -a bus with at least one generator device connected to it, and slack bus -the only bus in the grid that can provide the necessary power to maintain the power balance in the event that the real and reactive powers are not known at all buses. For the slack bus, the voltage magnitude and the phase angle are known (the voltage phase angle is normally set to zero degree). For a load bus, the real power and the reactive power are known. For a generator bus, the real power and the voltage magnitude are known.

If we metaphorise users, credit, risk, and trust in a social network into buses, power, voltage, and current respectively in an electrical grid, we can observe their similarities. For example, some users give credit to a social network; while others take credit from it as if some buses generate power; while others consume power in an electrical grid. Trust flows from users of high risk into users of low risk as if current flows from buses of high voltage into buses of low voltage. The credit = risk  X  trust relationship is metaphorical to the power = voltage  X  current relationship. Therefore, we will first model credit flows in a social network after power flows in an electrical grid, then infer the trust relationships between users in the network through credit flow analysis using the physical and mathematical principles of load flow analysis, and finally conduct a set of experiments with a real-world dataset to evaluate the credit flow based trust model against existing global and local trust models. Most online communities, such as Weblogs Blogger and Blogosphere , shopping sites eBay and Amazon , social media sites YouTube and Digg , review sites Epinions and Slash-dot , and peer-to-peer networks eDonkey and BitTorrent , al-low members to rate the content generated by their peers. Global trust models have used the rating information to infer each node X  X  universal reputation, but our model utilises such information to derive credit and further to trace the credit flows in order to infer personalised and accurate trust values. The credit flow model consists of four key elements: credit, risk, bias, and trust, analogous to power, voltage, phase an-gle, and current respectively in the power flow model.
Credit represents the confidence a user has in all other users. It can be derived from a user X  X  ratings given to other users (i.e. the credit brought into the network by the user) or a user X  X  ratings received from others (i.e. the credit taken out by the user). In a social network, a user X  X  confidence may vary in different context, given a specific category, a u ser X  X  credit in this category is called real credit C (anal-ogous to the real power in an electrical grid), while their credit in other categories is called reactive credit D (analo-gous to the reactive power in the electrical grid). It is worth clarifying that unlike in an electrical grid, inductance or ca-pacitance does not exist in a social network and therefore reactive credit simply means irrelevant credit as it is derived from the reviews received in categories other than the one in which the user X  X  expertise is to be estimated. Because the total credit derived from all the reviews given and received in all categories in a social network is balanced, reactive credit balance equations are needed to derive the risk factors and infer the trust values. To simplify the model, we only con-sider the net credit brought into the network, i.e. the credit brought in by a user minus the credit taken out by the same user. Specifically, user u  X  X  real C u and reactive credit D can be defined as: where i and j are reviews in category Ca , k and l are reviews in categories other than Ca , u to the review i in category Ca , while received by user u for her/his review j in category Ca , and  X  X  X  R u is the rating given by user u to the review k in categories other than Ca , while her/his review l in categories other than Ca .

Risk represents the possibility of incurring loss or failure when believing a user. Risk of believing someone is related to the expertise level, i.e. the level of one X  X  expert knowl-edge or skill in a particular field, of the person to be believed. Generally speaking, one with a high level of expertise would have a low risk of trust. Suppose the expertise E is the degree of competency in providing accurate ratings and ex-hibiting high activities in an online community [6]. A user X  X  risk factor R can be derived from their reviews on items in a category.

First, if an item i has received ratings from N users, each providing the rating R i u (1  X  u  X  N ) for it 1 , the average rating of this item from all the N users is:
I f user u has provided a rating for item i , then the average rating for item i from all other N  X  1 users excluding u is:
N ext, a small difference between user u  X  X  rating and the average rating from all other users suggests user u has a high level of expertise. The rationale behind this is to trust the R u should be has received for their reviews in the definition of risk, we choose this notation for the sake of simplicity.  X  X isdom of crowds X  [19], where large groups of cognitively and socially diverse individuals have proven superior than the elite few in solving problems, fostering innovation, or decision making. Therefore, user u  X  X  expertise of rating item i is: R Max is the maximum rating scale.

Finally, if user u has provided ratings for M items in a cat-egory, the risk of believing u is defined by the accumulated expertise of rating the M items:
Bias represents a user X  X  preference in giving credit to a piece of information given by another user. For example, in the music category, if one is interested in classical music and another is interested in pop music, the bias between the two users might be up to 90 degrees. The bias between two users u a and u b who have reviewed N items can be defined as: where W a and W b are items reviewed by users u a and u b respectively, N is the total number of items reviewed by u or u b , and W i u = 1 if user u reviewed item i or 0 otherwise.
Trust represents how much one user believes another in a particular subject field. It is directional and needs to be inferred from all relevant credit flows between three types of users in a social network: source user , appraisal user , and beneficiary user , analogous to the three types of buses respectively in an electrical grid: slack bus , generator bus , and load bus .

A source user X  X  trust values towards all others need to be inferred. A source user X  X  risk and bias are set to 1 and 0 respectively and the user X  X  credit needs to be derived because it is unknown in the beginning how much credit the user would bring into the network, but it is assumed that the user has a good balance between real and reactive credit.
An appraisal user evaluates other users by giving them credit. It is assumed that an appraisal user X  X  risk is known a priori. In the initial state, all credit in the network is brought in by the appraisal users. When inferring trust values for the source user, we suppose all credit is brought in by the source user and as such there is no need to calculate each appraisal user X  X  credit, which is set to a default minimal value.
A beneficiary user receives credit from appraisal users. A beneficiary user X  X  credit is negative as they take credit from instead of contributing credit to the network.

It is worth clarifying two points. First, users who have not been evaluated by others and who have evaluated others but have shown no expertise are excluded from our model as their credit could not be measured or verified. Second, the definitions of real and reactive credit refer to net credit, i.e. the credit brought in by a user minus the credit taken o ut by the same user. Therefore, an appraisal user would have positive credit, whereas a beneficiary user would have negative credit. We first formulate the credit balance equations: where N is the total number of users in a social network, C /D i is the net real/reactive credit given to user i , RK the complex conjugate of users i  X  X  risk factor, RK k is user k  X  X  risk factor, and Y ik is the total admittance between user i and k , which can be found from the user admittance ma-trix of the network. Give a source user among all the users, the admittance matrix is built according to the following two rules: (1) the admittance of elements connected between user k and the source user is added to entry ( k, k ) of the admit-tance matrix, and (2) the admittance of elements connected between users i and k is added to entries ( i, i ) and ( k, k ) of the admittance matrix, while the negative admittance is added to entries ( i, k ) and ( k, i ) of the admittance matrix.
The rationale behind the credit balance equation is the balance between the credit brought into the network and the credit taken out of the network. All credit brought into the network is properly distributed to the users that consume it, as if in an electrical grid, where the generated power is prop-erly distributed to all the load devices that use it. Therefore, we conjecture that credit distribution in a social network fol-lows the rules similar to those for power distribution in an electrical grid. On the one hand, if credit is fixed, lower risk infers more trust, which is similar to an electrical grid, where lower voltage leads to stronger current if the power is fixed. On the other hand, if risk is fixed, more credit infers more trust, which is similar to an electrical grid, where high power leads to stronger current if the voltage is fixed. For example, we would trust someone we are unfamiliar with if they were acclaimed by a well-known expert (i.e., the risk of believing this expert is low) or by lots of people (i.e., this person has high credit).
 Next, we formulate the credit flow equations:
C where G ik and B ik are the real and imaginary parts of the admittance matrix element Y ik (in Equation 7), and  X  ik is user i  X  X  bias against user k .

We then use the Newton-Raphson method to derive each beneficiary user X  X  risk and all credit flows within a social network. To do so, we first determine the normalised trust value between every pair of directly connected users using the following formula: w here r is user i  X  X  resistance factor against user j . Resistance is a psychological factor describing one X  X  instinctive distrust towards a stranger. The further away user A is from user B in a social network, the higher resistance (or the weaker trust) A would place on B because trust can be diluted over a long propagation path [4]. For example, if a propagation path consists of 10 nodes and the trust value from one node towards the next in the path is all 0.9, the last node will only receive the trust value of 0 . 9 10  X  0 . 35, and for this reason, some trust models such as MoleTrust [11] limit the length of a propagation path using a maximum depth in search.
The resistance factor is analogous to the impedance fac-tor associated with each transmission line in an electrical grid, which causes power loss in transmission. However, it is non-trivial to model resistance in a social network because many factors need to be considered and they are generally difficult to estimate accurately. For the sake of simplicity, the resistance factor between every pair of users is set to a constant and small value r = 0 . 05 + j  X  0 . 2 in the above formula, where 0.05 and 0.2 are empirical coefficients drawn from experimental data and j is the imaginary unit for irrel-evant credit. Credit dilution is related to the risk difference in that a higher risk suggests more diluted credit. The two empirical coefficients also suggest that irrelevant credit is diluted faster than relevant credit. Figure 3: Example of trust propagation from node i to node j via node k
According to the Kirchhoff X  X  circuit law, the credit flow-ing out of a node equals to the credit flowing into that node, and we can infer the trust value between each pair of indi-rectly connected users as such. It is worth clarifying that given a particular node, the outgoing credit to its neigh-bouring nodes may not equal to the incoming credit from its neighbouring nodes, but the outgoing credit to all reachable destination nodes must equal to the incoming credit from all source nodes because the total number of ratings given by the appraisal users must equal to the total number of rat-ings received by the beneficiary users. As shown in Figure 3, node i is directly connected to node k , which is also directly connected to node j . If the credit flows from node i to node k and from node k to node j are C ik and C kj respectively, and the total credit flowing into node k from directly con-nected nodes is C . k , then the credit flowing from node i to node j , and the trust value from node i to node j are: w here T . k is the total trust towards node k from directly con-nected nodes and T k i s node k  X  X  total trust towards directly connected nodes.
 If node i has M directly connected nodes and node j has N directly connected nodes, the trust value from i to j is:
Figure 4 shows an example of inferring trust relationships in a simple social network. Suppose Alice is the source user and we have already derived Bob X  X , Carol X  X , Dave X  X  and Eve X  X  credits to be 0.1, -3.2, -1.6, and -2.0 respectively using the credit flow based trust inference model. We can further de-rive that the real credit brought into the network by Alice is 6.9. If Bob X  X  risk is 0.95 (relative to the Alice X  X  risk 1.0), we can also derive Carol X  X , Dave X  X  and Eve X  X  risk factors to be 0.59, 0.62, and 0.38 respectively. Finally we can infer Alice X  X  trust value towards Carol, Dave and Eve to be 0.51, 0.26, and 0.23 respectively.

We have conducted a set of experiments using a real-world dataset to evaluate the CoreTrust model against existing models with objective and subjective trust metrics in order to answer the following two questions: 1. How does the credit flow based trust model compare 2. How does the credit flow based trust model compare
Epinions is a popular online e-commerce system where users can rate or write reviews on various items such as cars, books, or music, and rate the reviews contributed by other users. We used the Epinions dataset in our experiments. The dataset, consisting of various types of user interactions and rated objects in multiple categories, combines explicit user ratings and trust values with social networking. Epinions allows users to write their own reviews or rate other users X  reviews by assigning a helpfulness rating from 1 (not helpful) to 5 (most helpful). To encourage high quality reviews, the Income Share program is adopted to pay users according to the ratings of their reviews, where trust management is a critical issue. As such, Epinions allows a user to specify how much they trust others and the product reviews are ranked according to the web of trust for the user.

We developed a program using the techniques contributed by Richardson [15] to retrieve the trust relationships in Epin-ions by crawling the website. The dataset contains 28,377 users who contributed a total of 258,122 reviews on differ-ent categories of products, which received a total of 1,784,182 ratings. Due to the computational complexity, we only chose the  X  X ideo &amp; DVD X  category in our experiments as it has more reviews per product than other categories. Only users who contributed at least one review or rated at least one re-view are included in the dataset. A record in the dataset is either in the format of h review id, contributor id i w here re-view id i s the ID of a review on a subject, e.g., a movie in the category and contributor id i s the ID of the user who con-tributed the review or in the format of h review id , r ating , evaluator id i w here rating is in the scale from 1 to 5 and evaluator id i s the ID of the user who gave the rating.
We then extracted the trust relationships among these users, forming a web of trust graph consisting of 6,847 ver-tices and 77,965 edges. The graph is stored as records of h truster id , t rustee id i p air, where truster id i s the ID of the user making the trust statement, trustee id i s the ID of the user on which the trust statement was made, and the trust relationship is a directional edge from the truster id v ertex to the trustee id v ertex. In our web of trust graph, 2,879 vertices had at least one outbound and inbound edges and 4,576 vertices had at least one inbound edge.

It is worth pointing out that Epinions users can also keep a set of distrust relationships (or blacklist) by specifying users they do not trust at all, but unlike Guha X  X  work [3], we did n ot exploit distrust relationships and instead only focused on the trust relationships in our experiments primarily be-cause the amount of distrust relationships are rather small, for example in the dataset from Victor et al. [20], about 85% of the statements are labeled as trust. Nonetheless, we will investigate whether distrust relationships can be used to improve credit flow based trust model in our future work.
The dataset confirmed the similarity between a social net-work and an electrical grid in that they both follow the power law distribution [13] and are both small-world networks [21]. For example, we found that most users contributed very few reviews or ratings and that very few users contributed ex-tremely many reviews or ratings. Similarly, we found that most users trusted very few others and that very few users trusted extremely many others.
We first compare the prediction accuracy between the credit flow based model and global trust models using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1. Given a prediction result as the ranking of the topmost trustworthy users in a network, we define:
It is worth clarifying that the list of users who have been given trust statements by a user is much smaller than the list of users who are really trusted by this user, because the num-ber of explicit trust statements in Epinions is rather small. Therefore it is difficult to exactly measure the accuracy of trust prediction because we cannot simply assert whether a user trusts or distrusts other users without referring to ex-plicit trust statements. To overcome this difficulty, we treat the user trust statements as the ground truth and compare them with the objective reputation ranking of all users in the network by adjusting the length of topmost ranking accord-ing to each user X  X  preference. For example, if a user made trust statements about 5 users, we can measure the predic-tion accuracy based on the predicted top 10 most trustwor-thy users. In this experiment, we compare the CoreTrust method with the following two global trust methods:
Because these methods provide a unified objective ranking of reputation for all users, but our model provides person-alised ranking of trustworthiness for every individual user, we first derived unified and personalised trust values using the three methods respectively, then calculated the Preci-sion, Recall, and F1 metrics for each user, and finally took the average of the three metrics for the entire network.
Table 1 shows the prediction accuracy of the three meth-ods. The EigenTrust method performs slightly better than the Average method, but the CoreTrust method significantly outperforms the other two, especially in terms of the F1 met-rics, where both the precision and the recall are taken into account. The Average and EigenTrust methods assign a uni-versal trust score to each user and every other user in the network has to trust it in a unanimous way that is decided by the score. However, in the Epinions community, an individ-ual user has different preference and expertise and may be trusted by different users differently. The CoreTrust method has taken that fact into consideration by allowing multi-ple trust scores to be assigned to each user, one for every source user. Therefore, its Precision, Recall, and F1 metrics are much better than those for the Average and EigenTrust methods.

W e then compare the trust propagation accuracy between the credit flow based trust model and local trust models. In local trust models, explicit trust values are specified for di-rectly connected users, while trust values for indirectly con-nected users need to be inferred through trust propagation. In our experiments, we use two trust networks: one is the original web of trust collected from Epinions and the other is the web of credit constructed from the credit flow based trust model. We use the subjective metrics to propagate trust over both networks and compare their results.
This evaluation is a kind of leave-one-out cross-validation, where we are given a network with all (but one) of the trust values between nodes visible, and we need to predict this single suppressed value. The original web of trust in Epin-ions is a collection of binary ratings, i.e., trust (1) or distrust (0). We consider two commonly used metrics for evaluating binary classifiers: the classification accuracy for predicting correct ratings and the AUC for representing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve). If we define the number of trusted users and distrusted users as P positive instances and N negative instances respectively, a true positive T P occurs when both the prediction outcome and the actual value are trust, whereas a true negative T N occurs when the prediction outcome and the actual value are both distrust. Therefore, the accuracy is defined as:
The AUC value is calculated as an integral of ROC curve, w hich equals to the probability that a user who should be trusted is correctly predicted as a trusted rather than a dis-trusted. Therefore it outputs a probability instead of a bi-nary decision.

In this experiment, we compare the CoreTrust method with the following two local trust methods:
Because a trust value is binary in the web of trust but non-binary in the web of credit, a threshold is used in the web of credit to determine between trust and distrust. In the Direct method, trust is propagated as long as the inferred trust value in the web of credit is greater than the threshold. In the MoleTrust method, paths with the aggregated trust values above the threshold are selected for trust propagation. A tradeoff can be made between T P and T N by adjusting the threshold. We used a consistent predefined threshold to calculate the accuracy and AUC metrics.
 Figure 5: Accuracy evaluated on the web of trust a nd the web of credit
The Direct and MoleTrust methods were tested for predic-tion accuracy on both the Epionions web of trust and the web of credit constructed using the credit flow based trust model. Figure 5 shows that the two methods X  prediction accuracy results on the web of credit are clearly better than those on the web of trust, confirming that the credit flow based trust model can construct more accurate trust connectivity from an online community with users X  rating data. This may attribute to the sparse nature of the Epinions web of trust because the number of explicit trust statements made by each user in Epinions is rather small. In contrast, the web of credit is much denser because the credit flow based trust model can derive significant more trust relationships from users X  rating data.
 More importantly, comparing the Direct, MoleTrust, and CoreTrust methods tested on the web of credit, the CoreTrust method clearly outperforms the other two. This is because the CoreTrust method considers both generally agreed repu-tation and individual users X  preferences and expertise levels, while the other two methods only consider users X  subjective trust statements. The performance comparison is double confirmed by the results for AUC metrics in Figure 6, which are similar to those for the accuracy metrics in Figure 5.

With the increasing popularity of online social networking, information exchange between virtual relations has grown drastically over the past few years. Consequently trust man-agement in social networks becomes imperative as the infor-mation quality is closely related to the trustworthiness of the user from whom the information is received.

Existing objective trust models estimate a universal repu-tation for each node and do not allow others to take person-alised measures towards the same node. Conversely, existing subjective trust models only rely on explicit trust statements to construct a web of trust and do not consider a social net-work in its entirety. In this paper, we proposed the credit flow approach to modelling and inferring trust relations in social networks. This approach can construct a web of credit from the interactions in a social network and infer trust val-ues by making use of both generally agreed reliability and subjective individuality in the network. The experimental results on a real-world dataset show that the approach can accurately construct a web of credit and infer more accurate trust values than objective and subjective trust models do.
Although power flows in an electrical grid were used as a metaphor to model credit flows in a social network and our initial research has confirmed the hypothesis, we are con-scious of their differences. For example, an appraisal user can be a beneficiary user at the same time and vice versa in a social network, but a generator bus is normally not a load bus at the same time in an electrical grid. Therefore, we need to continue polishing the credit flow based trust model by refining existing model elements and their relationships and exploring new elements that can improve the model. For example, if one is both an appraisal and beneficiary user, it will be represented as two different nodes, leading to a more complex network but allowing for more accurate trust infer-ence. Resistance can be extended to model a user X  X  instinc-t ive distrust towards a stranger from mental, physical and cultural factors. We are also investigating more efficient al-gorithms for solving the credit balance equations, e.g., Fuzzy Logic Control, in order to reduce the computational com-plexity involved in our approach. We plan to showcase the credit flow based trust inference technique by applying it to a social search system [10], where participants can exchange information with their trusted peers.
