 User modeling, adaptation, and personalization techniques have hit the mainstream. The explosion of social network websites, on-line user-generated content platfo rms, and the tremendous growth in computational power of m obile devices are generating incredibly large amounts of user da ta, and an increasing desire of users to "personalize" (their de sktop, e-mail, news site, phone). The potential value of personalization has become clear both as a commodity for the benefit or enjo yment of end-users, and as an enabler of new or better services  X  a strategic opportunity to enhance and expand businesses. An exciting characteristic of recommender systems is that they draw the interest of industry and businesses while posing very intere sting research and scientific challenges. In spite of significant progress in the research community, and industry efforts to bring the bene fits of new techniques to end-users, there are still important ga ps that make personalization and adaptation difficult for users. Re search activities still often focus on narrow problems, such as incremental accuracy improvements of current techniques, sometimes w ith ideal hypotheses, or tend to overspecialize on a few applicative problems (typically TV or movie recommenders  X  sometimes simply because of the availability of data). This restra ins de facto the range of other applications where personalization technologies might be useful as well. Thus, we may have reached a good point to take a step back to seek perspective in the res earch done in recommender systems. This workshop contrives for a ne w uptake on past experiences and lessons learned. We propose an analytic outlook on new research directions, or ones that still requi re substantial research, with a special focus on their practical adoption in working applications, and the barriers to be met in this path. This workshop is an opportunity to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss, on one ha nd, the main lessons drawn from successes but also from failures of recommender systems, and on the other hand, identify and analyze the major research areas in recommendation and personalization technologies that should be addressed in the future for a practical, effective take-up of the needs of vendors, consumers, a nd technology providers. Selected papers fall into the following areas:
