 Since many applications rely on time-based data, visualizing tem-poral data and helping experts explore large time series data sets are critical in many application domains. In this interactive system preview, we argue that time series often carry structural features that can, if ef fi ciently identi fi ed and effectively visualized, help re-duce visual overload and help the user quickly focus on the rel-evant portions of the data sets. Relying on this observation, we introduce a novel STFMap system, which includes four innovative query-and feature-driven time series data set visualization tech-niques: (a) segment-maps ,(b) warp-maps ,(c) stretch-maps ,and (d) feature-maps . These rely on the salient temporal features of the time series and their alignments with respect to the given user query to help users explore the data set in a query-driven fashion.

Since many applications rely on time-based data, visualizing large temporal data sets is critical in many application domains. As can be seen in Figure 1, naive plot-based visualization of large time series data sets can become overly dense and, as a result, subtle differences and similarities between the time series can be lost in the resulting visual clutter. While visualization aids, such as time boxes [3], have been proposed to help reduce visual clut-ter in such plots, it is still hard to effectively compare features of the time series at different scales as the visualization is dominated by features that are large in amplitude. Various alternative visu-alization techniques, such as SAX-based time series bitmaps [6] or dimensionality-reduction based techniques [1], try to address this challenge by mapping time series to representations that are good at capturing the global characteristics of the data at the cost of loosing local features (Figure 2(a,b)). Other techniques, such as This work is supported by the NSF Grant 1043583  X  MiNC: NSDL Middleware for Network-and Context-aware Recommen-dations X . Authors are listed in alphabetical order.
 Figure 4: Segments de fi ned by the temporally consistent fea-ture matches across two time series tant to state that the identi fi ed salient features (de fi ned by a center and a temporal radius/scope) are robust against noise and common transformations, such as temporal shifts. Moreover, scale invari-ance enables the extracted salient features to be robust against vari-ations in speed of time.

In this paper we further recognize that if ef fi ciently identi fi ed and effectively leveraged within the context de fi ned by a user query, these salient features can also help user quickly focus on the rel-evant portions of the data sets. Relying on this observation, we describe an interactive system demonstration of a STFMap sys-tem, which includes (among others) four novel temporal data set visualization techniques, (a) segment-maps ,(b) warp-maps ,(c) stretch-maps ,and(d) feature-maps . All four techniques leverage the salient features of the time series, identi fi ed through a prepro-cessing step, to help explore large temporal data sets within the context of a given query. In the rest of the proposal, we describe the interactive system preview of the STFMap system.
The user fi rst selects, using the GUI interface, a data set, D ,and provides a query series, q , with the goal of exploring the time series in
D based on their similarities and differences to q . We propose to demonstrate STFMap using data sets from [5] (Figure 1) as well as economic index time series obtained from [9].
STFMap fi rst analyzes the feature alignments between the query and all time series in D and identi fi es temporally consistent match-ing pairs of salient features across q and series in D . As illustrated in Figure 4, given two series q and s  X  D , the boundaries of the matching features partition both q and s into segments: consecu-tive segments differ in that some existing features have ended or new features have started. Intuitively, the segment boundaries of s describe how the features of s relate to the features of q . Therefore, a segment-map describes how the segments of the time series in D , relative to the query time series q , are distributed.
 Figure 5(a) shows a segment-map, where 50 time series in the Gun data set are plotted as column s of pixels (blue indicates low amplitude points, whereas red indicates high amplitude points). Segment boundaries are indicated with horizontal lines.

The segment-map also enables the user to have a multi-resolution view of the distribution of matching features: one can roll-up the data by clustering nearby features and the segments they induce. The boundaries of the rolled-up features de fi ne a new smaller set of segments, where some of the consecutive segments are combined into larger segments. Figure 5(b) shows a rolled-up segment map; the fi gure also shows a drill-down window on the segment-map.
Dynamic time warping (DTW [2, 4]) represents the minimum time warping needed to align to series. The demonstration will also include warp-maps, which visualize the warping needed for aligning the time series in D with a given query series, q . Figure 8: A stretch-map ( Gun data set): red indicates large for-ward stretching, dark blue indicates large backward stretch-ing, and green corresponds to low or no stretching) Figure 9: A feature-map ( Gun data set): darker red indicates better feature matches; series are ordered left-to-right in the order of best matching feature and on each series the bound-aries of the best matching feature is highlighted
The demonstration will also include novel stretch-maps which, while being similar to warp-map, help the user focus on the major alignment differences more quickly: see the red and blue regions at the left and right extremes of the stretch-map shown in Figure 8. In a stretch-map, the point s [ i ] is painted with the value of i  X  cor ( q, s [ i ]) : in this case, the more negative the difference between the matching positions is, the darker the blue and the more positive the difference is, the darker is the red used for painting s [ i ] . Shades of green denote none or little stretching.
