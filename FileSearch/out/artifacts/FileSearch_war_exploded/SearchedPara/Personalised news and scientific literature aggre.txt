 1. Introduction
The World Wide Web (WWW) is teeming with information and still rapidly expanding. Today, part of its content is con-tributed by thousands of individuals, who grasped the opportunity offered by the WWW to publish their ideas and thoughts through Weblogs (or blogs ), web forums and social networking sites. At the same time, virtually every news organisation has recognised the potential (or even the threat) of these new forms of information dissemination and has initialised online operations offering its content. The scientific world was an early adopter of the internet for online collaboration and ex-change of knowledge. Nowadays, a large percentage of scientific work, like peer reviewed scientific publications, is accessible online.

The availability of daily updated content is without doubt of great value, but at the same time it intensifies the already omnipresent information overload problem. It is becoming more and more difficult for individuals to identify interesting information within the increasing daily income of blog entries, news and scientific publications. Staying up to date on topics of interest is increasingly a tedious job, and at the same time, an essential habit for many.

Fortunately, moving away from the paper matter paved new ways for managing real-time information. One way to assist a user in dealing with the task of finding relevant information is through the personalisation of web content, i.e. the customi-sation of a web page X  X  content according to an individual X  X  interests. This can be achieved with Information Filtering (IF), which uses a tailored representation of a user X  X  interests, called  X  X  X rofile X , to evaluate the relevance of incoming documents and then appropriately present them to the user, typically in decreasing relevance order.

Collaborative filtering, is the process of evaluating information items based on the opinion of the members of a community. It is usually based on a matrix that represents the ratings that each community member has assigned to specific information items (e.g. documents, movies, products). Correlations between users with similar interests, and between items preferred by common users are calculated according to the rating matrix and produce predictions, or recommendations, for a given user and one or more items ( Schafer, Frankowski, Herlocker, &amp; Sen, 2007, chap. 9: Collaborative filtering recommeder systems ). Collaborative filtering has been successfully applied to recommend movies, 1 music tracks 2 and books, 3 but when it comes to continuously flowing information, like daily news, and not relatively static collections of information items, there are certain discrepancies.

Recommendations on newly published information items cannot be made, since there exist no user ratings on which to base the predictions, while the few early ratings that may be attributed to recently published information items are also inadequate for producing confident recommendations. Furthermore, collaborative filtering systems are known to suffer by the sparsity problem . When the number of information items in a domain far exceeds the number of users, then a user can only absorb and rate a small percentage of items. The rating matrix is consequently sparse and there is not enough over-lap between user ratings on which to base a prediction. The sparsity problem is further exaggerated in the case of daily news dissemination, which produces a stream of information rather than a (static) repository. Finally, collaborative filtering can only successfully accommodate users who share interests with many peers. Usually, predictions for individuals with partic-ular taste that do not consistently agree or disagree with any group of people cannot be equally confident.

Content-based filtering can be an alternative solution to personalised information delivery (Pazzani &amp; Billsus, 2007, chap. 10: Content-based recommendation systems ), which overcomes the above drawbacks. In content-based filtering the user profile is built based on the actual content of information items (typically documents) that the user has already viewed and found interesting. It is then used to evaluate the content of incoming information and assess its relevance to the user interests. Content-based filtering is constrained to information media (like text) for which descriptive features can be auto-matically extracted, or have been manually assigned. Unlike collaborative filtering, its application for recommending audio and visual information is still cumbersome, although a lot of progress has been made towards automatic feature extraction from music and images. Nevertheless, content-based filtering does not suffer from the above discrepancies of collaborative filtering. Content-based document filtering uses a separate profile for each user, which can evaluate any document, regard-less of the availability of ratings by other users. Content-based methods do not require a relatively consistent rating matrix and can easily deal with the short-term life span of news stories. For these reasons, content-based filtering is better suited to news personalisation than collaborative filtering (Billsus &amp; Pazzani, 2007, chap. 18: Adaptive news access ).
Content-based filtering though, is a difficult task for a number of reasons. First, user interests change over time, either due to inherent reasons, or because new topics of interest emerge. This calls for user profiles that can effectively adapt to interest changes. Second, users are typically interested in a broad range of topics. Representing multiple topics of interest with a sin-gle user profile is a requirement not easily addressed. To represent multiple interests, a user profile has to be able to assim-ilate a large number of descriptive features, and many existing algorithms suffer due to this increase in dimensionality.
Although research in adaptive content-based IF preceded that in collaborative filtering and there have been dedicated tracks in the well established Text Retrieval Conference, today, unlike collaborative filtering, there are no successful content-based filtering applications on the web. The reasons for this absence are not yet clear. Many research systems have been developed and evaluated, but none has reached mainstream usage. After the removal of the filtering track from TREC 2002 and onwards, research interest in IF has also dropped. At the same time, with the rise of dynamically broadcast content, the need for per-sonalised information delivery services has significantly increased.

This paper describes our efforts to develop and deploy a dual, real world personalisation service based on Nootropia, 4 an immune-inspired user profiling model for adaptive IF. The Personalised News and Paper Aggregator allows a user to specify online information sources and the system maintains a user profile for evaluating the relevance, to the user X  X  interests, of information items coming from these sources. The evaluated items are presented to the user in decreasing relevance order and the user X  X  reading patterns form the basis for profile adaptation. The service is publicly available online at http://noo.-lisys.gr . We have invited real users to evaluate the personalised aggregator and we performed a user study, which shows that
Nootropia can effectively and efficiently learn a user X  X  interests. The study also revealed that the real world application of IF is a complicated task with many aspects affecting the system X  X  viability.

The rest of this paper is organised as follows. The next section briefly reviews existing approaches to the personalisation of news and paper delivery. Section 3 presents Nootropia, the user profiling model that lies at the core of the proposed appli-cation. Section 4 summarises their basic architecture and describes its implementation and usage. In Section 5 we set out the methodology of our user study and we discuss its results. We conclude with a summary and plans for future work in Section 6. 2. Related work
Content-based IF relies on surrogate representations of documents and user profiles. Existing approaches typically adopt the Vector Space Model (Salton &amp; McGill, 1983 ) that expresses both documents and profiles as vectors in a space with as many dimensions as the number of unique words in the documents. This allows the application of trigonometric measures of similarity, like the cosine similarity and the inner product, for comparing a profile vector to a document vector ( Jones &amp; Fur-nas, 1986 ). The comparison assigns a relevance score to each document, which can be used to filter out non-relevant infor-mation, or to order incoming documents according to decreasing relevance. The user then expresses his satisfaction or dissatisfaction on the filtering results and thus provides the necessary feedback for the profile X  X  adaptation. User feedback can be either explicit or implicit. In the first case a user takes the time to declare a viewed document as either relevant or non-relevant, or to rate it using a numeric scale. On the other hand, implicit feedback is inferred by observing the user X  X  interaction with the system, like which documents are read. 2.1. Profile adaptation
Profile adaptation is a complex problem. In addition to short-term variations in the level of interest in certain topics, more radical interest changes, like the progressive loss of interest in a topic or the emergence of a new topic of interest, can also occur. The user profile has to be able to adapt at different speeds, according to the rate of change. It has to be able to learn an emerging topic of interest and forget a no longer interesting topic. The most common approach to profile adaptation has been the use of learning algorithms that move the profile X  X  vector towards the vector of a document that received positive feedback and away from the vector of a document that received negative feedback (Lam, Mukhopadhyay, Mostafa, &amp; Palakal, 1996). The most well studied learning algorithm is Rocchio (1971, chap. 14) ; it linearly moves the profile vector with a rate that is analogous to a learning coefficient. Learning algorithms, however, do not fully adhere to the adaptation requirements of IF. The learning coefficient pre-defines the speed of adaptation. A small learning coefficient leads to profiles with high iner-tia and vice versa.

Biologically inspired approaches like Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) propose a more dynamic solution to adaptive IF. The insight behind EAs is that fundamental components of biological evolution can be used to evolve solutions to problems within computers. Evolutionary IF systems maintain a population of user profiles that col-lectively represent the user X  X  interests. The population evolves according to user feedback. Individual profiles that better rep-resent the user interests, become fitter, reproduce and proliferate, while those that do not receive positive feedback are eventually removed from the population. Examples of evolutionary IF systems can be found in Sheth (1994), Winiwarter (1999) and Menczer and Belew (1998).

AIS are based on the biological immune system. An organism X  X  immune system has to be able to differentiate between foreign molecules (non-self), which it destroys, and the organism X  X  own molecules (self), which have to be left unharmed. This ability for self X  X on-self discrimination makes the natural systems a well suited computational metaphor for tackling IF, where  X  X  X elf X  can correspond to information relevant to the user and  X  X  X on-self X  to unwanted information. Examples of immune-inspired IF systems include those in Secker, Freitas, and Timmis (2003) and Oda and White (2005). A review of evo-lutionary and immune-inspired IF can be found in Nanas and De Roeck (2008a). 2.2. Personalised news access
Personalised news access has always been one of the major applications of IF, with its own particularities ( Billsus &amp; Paz-zani, 2007, chap. 18: Adaptive news access ). Early examples aimed at news items disseminated through distributed internet systems like Usenet. They include systems like ProFile (Amati, Crestani, Ubaldini, &amp; Nardis, 1997), Alipes ( Widyantoro, Loer-ger, &amp; Yen, 2001 ), NewsWeeder (Lang, 1995 ), NewsDude ( Billsus &amp; Pazzani, 1999 ), NewT ( Sheth, 1994 ) and others, which typically employ vector-based, document and profile representations and trigonometric measures of similarity for document evaluation.

These systems deal with a user X  X  multiple interests either by maintaining a separate profile for each interesting topic (Amati et al., 1997; Widyantoro et al., 2001 ), or by adopting clustering algorithms (Billsus &amp; Pazzani, 1999; Lang, 1995). In the first case, IF is treated as a classification task and a separate classifier is trained based on a large number of relevant documents using, for example, probabilistic methods (Amati et al., 1997 ). Clustering algorithms on the other hand incremen-tally identify topics of interest. They maintain a certain number of past training documents in memory and compare their vector representations with the vector-representations of incoming documents.

The amount of past training documents that clustering algorithms maintain has a similar effect on learning speed with the learning coefficient. A large number of training examples causes the profile to be less sensitive to current interests and vice versa. One solution proposed in the literature is to use a dual profiling model. Two different levels of clustering are used to account for long-term and short-term interest changes respectively. Short-term clusters are built from recent documents, while long-term clusters from a larger set that contains past documents. When documents cannot be confidently classified by the short-term clusters, classification is delegated to the long-term clusters (Chiu &amp; Webb, 1998 ). Such dual pro-files have been applied for adaptive news filtering in Billsus and Pazzani (2000) and Eichmann and Srinivasan (2002).
Recently, the Really Simple Syndication (RSS) format is increasingly adopted for broadcasting online, frequently updated content like news. RSS allowed the development of systems, which are usually called RSS Readers (or Aggregators ) and allow a user to aggregate and manage multiple RSS feeds. A comprehensive review of such systems can be found in Katakis, Tsouma-kas, Banos, Bassiliades, and Vlahavas (2008) . Adaptive personalised RSS aggregators in particular, exploit explicit or implicit user feedback to recommend news articles to users. However, none of the reviewed systems is content-based. They are either voting systems that use algorithms to rank articles based on community votes (e.g., Digg, 5 or Reddit 6 ), or they are col-laborative filtering systems that calculate recommendations based on the common interests of community members (e.g., Goo-gle News, 7 PNS 8 and Findory 9 ). One exception, is the PersoNews system described in Katakis et al. (2008). It uses a separate
Bayesian classifier for each user-feed and user-topic pair to filter out uninteresting news items. PersoNews is an interesting at-tempt to  X  X  X econstitute the conception of intelligent news readers X , but it remains an experimental system without broad usage.
A similar experimental effort is the Personalised News Service (PNS) ( Paliouras, Mouzakidis, Moustakas, &amp; Skourlas, 2008 ). It uses simple content-based filtering based on the predefined categories (e.g., economy) and sources (e.g., BBC) that a user reg-ularly views, as well as various types of collaborative filtering based on demographic data, or on clustering users into commu-nities based on their common interests. PNS exploits these filtering modes to provide different personalised views on the news it aggregates from various predefined sources.

It should be noted that although we have focused on adaptive news filtering, the same methods and issues apply to the domain of personalised paper delivery. The rate with which scientific papers are published is without a doubt much lower than the one for news, but still, there is enough volume of information flow and in many scientific domains it has become difficult to keep track of what is being published. Furthermore, researchers do have multiple scientific interests that change over time. In Bollacker, Lawrence, and Giles (1999) , the authors describe an extension to the CiteSeer digital library that pro-vides alerts of papers relevant to a user. However, the described approach does not deal with multiple and changing user interests. 2.3. Conclusions
Overall, in contrast to the successful application of collaborative filtering systems and even of relatively simple voting systems in sites like Google News and Digg, which have thousands of users, content-based IF systems have not gained broad acceptance. Despite the research efforts, a successful personalisation service based on content-based IF has yet to emerge.
There is clearly space for innovation in this direction, and Nootropia is innovative in a number of ways. It can effectively rep-resent multiple topics of interest and their relative importance with a single user profile (Nanas, Uren, De Roeck, &amp; Domin-gue, 2004). There is no need for several profiles (e.g., one for each topic of interest to the user) and hence the system is easily manageable, very efficient and it involves a small number of parameters that require fine tuning. Furthermore, Nootropia has the ability to adjust structurally in response to user feedback and can thus adapt to a variety of changes in user interests (Nanas &amp; DeRoeck, 2008b ). Variations in the level of interest in each topic are quickly reflected by the profile X  X  structure.
More progressively, the profile can learn an emerging topic of interest and forget a no longer interesting topic. These and other advantages of Nootropia have prompted us to work towards the development of a series of real world applications for personalised information dissemination.

As part of this ongoing effort, in this paper we present two such applications. We believe that the ultimate criterion of success for an IF system is its ability to attract and maintain the involvement of real users. We attempted to go beyond exper-imental systems, which are developed mainly for proving a concept or for evaluating an algorithm and are later abandoned, to instead develop full fledged user friendly applications with the potential to fill in the existing gap. We still have a long way to go, but these first two steps have proved a successful first attempt. Their design, implementation and evaluation have pro-vided us with significant insights into a variety of aspects that influence the successful application of IF. They also show that adaptive IF can have a broader scope that extends beyond the filtering of an information stream according to the interests of a single user. IF can be an essential component of web applications that provide a broad range of personalised dissemination services to the members of an online community. 3. User profiling with Nootropia
Nootropia is an immune-inspired user profiling model that proposes an integrated solution to adaptive IF. A single profile structure represents a user X  X  multiple interests and adapts to a variety of interest changes without the need to maintain in memory past training documents and to use different adaptation levels.

More specifically, Nootropia is inspired by the view of the immune system as a self-organising network of interacting antibodies, which reacts autonomously in order to define and preserve the host organism X  X  identity ( Nanas &amp; DeRoeck, 2008b ). For content-based filtering, the user profile is a weighted network of terms. Nodes represent terms (single words) extracted statistically from the content of relevant documents and their weights measure their significance. Links between nodes represent, unlike in vector-based profiles, statistical dependencies between terms. These are identified and measured using a sliding window approach. A window of 10 10 contiguous terms slides through the document X  X  text and the frequency of co-occurence, as well as the average distance between two terms, are used to calculate the weight of the link between these terms. The nodes in the network are ordered according to decreasing weight, giving rise to separate hierarchical sub-networks, which correspond to the topics of interest to the user (Nanas et al., 2004 ). Fig. 1 depicts a schematic representation of a user profile with two overlapping hierarchical sub-networks that correspond to two topics of interest.

Document evaluation is performed with a directed spreading activation process. Profile terms that appear in a new doc-ument get activated and subsequently disseminate part of their activation to other activated terms, further up the hierarchy and through the corresponding links. The amount of activation that is disseminated between two activated terms is analo-gous to the weight of the link between them. The dissemination process is sequential and follows the direction that the hier-archy implies. It starts with the activated term with the lowest weight and terminates when the activated term with the largest weight is reached. A relevance score is then calculated as the weighted sum of the final activation of terms. The over-all effect is a non-linear document evaluation function that takes into account the term dependencies in the profile X  X  network (Nanas et al., 2004 ).

In contrast to vector-based profiles that ignore term-dependencies and feature linear evaluation functions like the inner product, or cosine similarity measure, taking into account term dependencies leads to dimensionality resistance. Profiles that ignore term dependencies represent equally all possible combinations of profile terms and thus become diluted as the num-ber of profile terms (dimensions in the vector space) increases, causing an exponential increase in the number of term com-binations. Taking into account term dependencies allows Nootropia to distinguish between term combinations that are relevant to topics of interest from those that are not. As a result, it can incorporate the large number of terms that are re-quired for representing multiple interests, without a loss in specificity. Experiments using a multi-topic filtering problem compared a network profile to a vector-based profile containing exactly the same weighted terms and the results indicate that taking into account term dependencies can increase filtering performance (Nanas et al., 2004 ).

Profile adaptation is performed through an immune-inspired process of self-organisation that adjusts the network X  X  structure in response to user feedback (Nanas &amp; DeRoeck, 2008b ). Given a document that received positive feedback, profile terms that appear in the document get reinforced at the expense of the rest. 11 Terms that run out of weight are purged from the profile and new terms extracted from the document are incorporated and inter-linked. Overall, the size of existing hier-archies adjusts quickly in response to short-term interest variations, new hierarchies can emerge to account for emerging topics of interest and hierarchies that correspond to no longer interesting topics progressively disintegrate and are eventu-ally forgotten. The pace of adaptation is not predefined by some learning coefficient, but depends inherently on the current network structure and the novelty and informativeness of the feedback document. Experiments using virtual users with sim-ulated interest changes demonstrate Nootropia X  X  ability to adapt to a variety of interest changes and to dynamically control its size and connectivity (Nanas &amp; DeRoeck, 2008b ). It has also been argued that this immune-inspired approach to adaptive IF has certain advantages over evolutionary algorithms, which have the tendency to converge to one topic and progressively loose valuable diversity (Nanas &amp; De Roeck, 2007; Nanas &amp; DeRoeck, 2008b ).

Nootropia X  X  properties enable an integrated solution to the adaptive filtering of news and scientific publications. A single user profile can handle multiple interests, scientific or not, and adapt to either fast or progressive changes in them. This inte-gration has many beneficiary practical implications. A single user profile is more easily managed by the user and facilitates system design and implementation. The number of system parameters is significantly reduced. In particular, there are just two basic system parameters, the weight threshold used for extracting terms and the size of the sliding window used to identify term correlations. Their optimum values have both been experimentally determined. The model is generally resil-ient and extensible as we will further discuss in the last section. 4. Prototype implementation
In this section we describe two implementations of Nootropia for personalised aggregation of news and scientific publi-cations. The two systems are still at experimental stage and constitute the first components of a broader web application that will provide a series of personalised services for information dissemination and exchange between members of an online community. Here we first introduce the general architecture for personalised information delivery of real time information to an individual, or a community, and we then present the usage of the corresponding systems. 4.1. General architecture
The general architecture for personalised aggregation of daily information is depicted in Fig. 2 . On the server side, each member of an online community is assigned an initially empty, private user profile . User specified sources, such as news sites, blogs, digital repositories, scientific libraries and mailing lists, provide the profile with a daily updated stream of incoming information items. The current implementation uses Really Simple Syndication (RSS) technology 12 for generating this stream. An RSS feed is a regularly updated XML file containing a summary of the content from an associated web site. A user can read
RSS content with a dedicated software called  X  X  X SS reader X , which monitors the feeds that the user subscribes to, and fetches any new content. News and scientific papers that correspond to user specified RSS feeds are analysed for feature extraction and are stored in a database for as long as they appear in the feed. In this way, the parsing and statistical analysis of an information item X  X  content is only performed once when the item appears in an RSS feed. The pre-processed items are then evaluated by the user profile, which generates a new aggregated feed with items ordered according to decreasing relevance score. Each news item is evaluated based on the title and the content of the corresponding web site and each paper is evaluated based on its title and abstract. All items in the RSS feeds that community members have subscribed to, are indexed and become searchable for future reference. For this purpose we adopted the open source search engine Lucene. 13
On the client side, we used Asynchronous Javascript and XML (AJAX) 14 to construct a responsive interface that is dynam-ically updated without the need to reload the web page. The user X  X  news, or scientific papers, are presented as dynamically compiled ranked lists. When the user chooses to view an information item, the profile X  X  adaptation is triggered and the remaining information items are re-evaluated by the adapted profile.

The same general architecture also applies for implementing a profile that represents the general interests of the com-munity as a whole. To achieve dynamic aggregation of content according to the changing information needs of the commu-nity, a collective profile is built and evaluates RSS feeds, which are aggregated in a public web page. Those information items that the members choose to view trigger the adaptation of the common collective profile, which essentially provides as with the capability to develop web applications whose content dynamically adapts to their visitor X  X  interests. We are currently developing such collective filtering systems, mostly within the context of web observatories. Our efforts in this direction are described in detail in a forthcoming paper. Next, we concentrate on private filtering. 4.2. Personalised filtering
The Personalised News and Paper Aggregator , 15 nicknamed Noo , is a web application that facilitates a user in monitoring a series of RSS feeds for relevant information. Without personalisation this can be a cumbersome task. The user would have to scan a large number of information items to identify those few that are of interest. The proposed system builds a separate profile for each subscribed community member and uses it to evaluate the relevance of news, or papers, coming from RSS feeds that the user has subscribed to. It then produces an aggregated ranked list with the most relevant items appearing at the top of the list. Therefore, it becomes easier for the user to identify interesting items and ignore the rest.

The application uses two separate web pages, one for news and the other for papers, 16 but with identical interface. For the rest of this section we focus our description on the news aggregator, noting any significant difference with the paper aggre-gator. Fig. 3 depicts the web page for news aggregation. It consists of a display area on the left and a stack of panels on the right. At the top of the display area there is a toolbar which contains a series of buttons with functionality related to the news article being displayed. At the top of the stack of panels, the user can find the search field and above it a choice of links. More specifically, there are five panels:
My News/My Papers: This is the panel that presents the ranked list of information items (news or papers). A flag button
When the news story (or a Scopus item) is displayed it is accompanied by a toolbar with a series of buttons. The user can click on the  X  X  X lus X  ( X  X  X inus X ) button to provide explicit positive (negative) feedback, which triggers anew the profile X  X  adap-tation based on the text of the displayed news story (or paper). The second button allows the user to specify free language tags for annotating the displayed information item. The third button is for emailing the news story (or paper) to a friend. This is a first simple way to establish horizontal communication between the system X  X  subscribers. Finally, the last button is for bookmarking the information item using existing web sites.

In a typical use case scenario, when a user logs in for the first time, the  X  X  X y News X  panel is empty. The user can expand the  X  X  X onfigure Panel X  to add the feeds to be monitored (Fig. 4 (left)). If the feed has already been specified by another user, and thus is included in the system X  X  database, the addition is immediate. In the opposite case it takes a few seconds for the system to fetch and analyse the content of the items in the feed. After this process, the  X  X  X y News X  panel is populated, but since the user X  X  profile has not been generated yet, all items have an initial score of zero. Viewing one item is enough to pro-duce the initial profile that assigns a relevance score to the remaining items. Subsequently, every time the user views, or provides feedback to, an item, the profile adapts and produces a new ranked list of items. This process is performed in the background and is rapid enough to be almost  X  X  X ransparent X  during the user X  X  interaction with the system. As we will see in the next section, the system easily overcomes the cold start problem and quickly becomes useful to the user and at-tracts her/his attention.

The rest of the panels are auxiliary and assist the user in organising and sharing what was already viewed. Furthermore, the search facility, the system X  X  folksonomy in the  X  X  X ag cloud X  panel and the  X  X  X ost popular X  panel can provide the user with interesting information items, which are not included in  X  X  X y News X . This is an important property that can provide a remedy to the problem of profile overspecialisation to what the user has already seen. The profile can adapt based on items outside the evaluated list; items that could move the profile towards new areas of interest.

Finally, there are also auxiliary links at the top right corner of the web page (see Fig. 3 ) that can be used for logging out, for visiting the system X  X  forum (where bugs and other comments are submitted), for visiting the user survey (see Section 5) and for visualising the profile. For the latter case we used the RGraph of the Javascript Information Visualisation Toolkit (JIT). 18 Although the user profile is not a tree, the RGraph was considered the best possible approximation for visualising the profile X  X  network. Fig. 6 depicts an example profile visualisation. The user may choose the number of profile nodes to be displayed. In the example, the graph comprises the thirty most important profile nodes, i.e., those with the highest weight, out of possibly more than a thousand profile nodes. The largest a node X  X  weight, the bigger the circle representing it in the graph. Accordingly, the width of graph edges reflects the weight of profile links. For the time being, profile visualisation just provides the user with a glimpse of what is happening in the background. This we feel is important, because providing such an insight makes the user less reluctant to use a system that maintains information about the user X  X  interests. Furthermore, profile visualisation provided us with a very useful research tool that produced interesting findings. For instance, we realised that profile nodes can correspond to noise X  words, such as  X  X  X sername X  or  X  X  X ignup X , that are not related to the content of information items, but are extracted from all web pages belonging to the same source (e.g. Webmonkey.com). These  X  X  X oise X  words can cause a bias to-wards information items coming from the source that the user visits more regularly. This is not necessarily an undesired system behaviour but, nevertheless, presenting the information items by source (as in Fig. 4 (right)) resolves this issue, because the ordering of items within each source is not affected by such noise words. In the future, profile visualisation could also serve as an interface for the user to tweak the profile, or for personalised navigation of information items. 4.3. Usage scenario
It is interesting to briefly present a naive usage scenario of our system that exhibits its usability and strongly supports our claims on its effectiveness in quickly adapting to a user X  X  interests. Our usage scenario lays in the following context: the user has just been informed of the existence of the Nootropia system and chooses to try it. He just wants to be informed on gen-eral issues and is particularly interested in the activities of the Obama X  X  administration. Our scenario assumes that the user has very minimal knowledge concerning the WWW and has access to a popular browser other than Explorer. It consists of the following steps: (1) The user visits the entry page of the system for the first time, signs-up and is redirected to the main page ( Fig. 3 ). (2) The list of news items on the right is initially empty. (3) Since everything looks empty the user hits configure . The user is not sure which RSS url prefers to insert (or maybe she (4) The user now hits My News and a rather long list of news items appears in no particular order all with score equal to (5) The user then views three articles relevant to the Obama X  X  administration and expresses her postive feedback. (6) The My News list is refreshed and the news items are rearranged as shown in the screenshot in the middle of Fig. 7 . (7) The user continues viewing two more articles of her interest and provides positive feedback. The list is refreshed again
The above usage scenario demonstrates how quickly Nootropia can learn a user X  X  interests. Just a few viewed news items are sufficient for bringing relevant news stories at the top of the list. This is an important property because it means that Nootropia requires minimum user effort. Just a few clicks are enough for the generation of a personalised list of news items.
The user does not have to explicitly specify the topics of interest. It is also important, because the user can quickly observe that the system is actually learning her/his interests and is thus prompted to keep on using it.
 5. Evaluation and analysis
Adaptive content-based IF systems are by nature interactive. Their viability relies on user involvement, since the user is the only source of the necessary feedback (implicit or explicit). A successful IF system has to be adopted by individual users and become ingrained into their daily practices. Consequently, the experimental evaluation of an IF system is not straight-forward and has been itself a research issue. In a thorough review of evaluation practices (Hanani, Shapira, &amp; Shoval, 2001 ), the authors make a distinction between analytical evaluation, evaluation by simulation and evaluation by experimentation.
Ideally, IF systems should be evaluated analytically so that the system X  X  behaviour is explicitly decoded. However, due to the increasing complexity of IF systems, analytical approaches are usually extremely difficult. As a result, typically research-ers rely on simulated experiments. The simulation involves a document collection that has been manually pre-classified according to specific topic categories. Instead of real users, virtual users with simulated interest in these topics provide the system with relevance feedback. Simulated experiments can be reproduced accurately and are well suited for fine tuning a system before deploying it in a real situation. Simulated experiments are also appropriate for comparing different systems, but this implies the agreement on a common and reproducible evaluation standard. This is the motivation behind the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC), which has been held annually since 1992. TREC X  X  IF track was dedicated to the comparative evaluation of IF systems and has attracted many contestants. The removal of the IF track after the 2001 TREC has left behind a significant gap in the simulated evaluation of IF systems. It also marked a decline of research interest in the field, despite the fact that there are still no successful practical applications of IF.

One possible explanation is that simulated experiments simplify the task of IF, because they avoid all the intricacies of interacting with real users. Furthermore, they concentrate mainly on filtering accuracy and ignore issues like system respon-siveness, scaling, continuous adaptation and others, which can significantly contribute to user dissatisfaction and eventually to the system X  X  rejection. The ultimate success criterion for IF is its viability. An IF system has to be able to continuously sat-isfy a user X  X  information needs, ensuring its long-term usage. Evaluation by experimentation introduces real users to the evaluation process and provides a better insight, to that of simulated experiments, into the human related issues that IF sys-tems have to resolve. The problem is that experiments involving real users are neither reproducible, nor comparable. Nev-ertheless, many researchers have mobilised real users for testing their systems (Balabanovic  X  et al., 1997 ), or combined simulated experiments with evaluation by experimentation (Moukas, Zacharia, &amp; Maes, 1999; Sheth, 1994 ). In all those cases, a small number of testers 19 were first trained on how to use the system and to provide feedback. They were then asked to evaluate it for a certain period of time. This was probably done to control the experimental process as much as possible.
As already discussed in Section 3, we have tested Nootropia with simulated experiments that evaluated its filtering per-formance and its ability to adapt. The results have been satisfactory and prompted the development of the web applications described in this paper. Instead of programming a simple interface just for testing Nootropia, we actually attempted the development of a real world application, which is publicly available. This goal has raised the requirements for stability, responsiveness and user-friendliness, in addition to filtering accuracy. It also allowed for a more holistic stance towards
IF, which is not studied in isolation X  X s just another algorithmic problem X  X ut as an integrated component of a real world application, where a variety of factors can influence user satisfaction and, therefore, system adoption. Finally, the develop-ment of a publicly available web application gave us the opportunity to expose Nootropia to real users, receive their valuable feedback, and conduct the informal user study described bellow. 5.1. Methodology
The user study focused on the evaluation of the Personalised News Aggregator, which has a broader appeal, even to the non-scientist. We did not use a task oriented approach or a scenario based one. Instead we invited a variety of users from different backgrounds to try Noo and use it in their own way and for their own purposes. The adoption rate of the system among the invited users has been part of the evaluation process. Through out the evaluation period we closely, but anony-mously, monitored the system X  X  usage frequency.

More specifically, once the application was up and running and we were confident of its stability, we started inviting users to sign up. In a few cases, an informal presentation instructed the invited users on how to use the system. Early users were prompted to use the site X  X  forum for any comments and for reporting bugs. This feedback helped us to further improve the system. For example, in our initial implementation, whenever a user clicked to view a complete story (or paper) the rapid profile adaptation was causing the immediate reordering of the item list. Some users found this confusing, because they were losing track of the ordering of items. The solution was to reorder the list only when the user clicked on the dedicated  X  X  X e-fresh X  button, or switched tabs. The importance of this allegedly minor modification is that users were willing to drop the system X  X  immediate response for better usability.

Progressively, we invited more people from a variety of backgrounds to sign up. Two months after the system X  X  initiali-sation, we added the profile visualisation functionality and invited all subscribers by email to view their profiles. Given the opportunity, we also prompted them to complete an online questionnaire. 20 The goal of the questionnaire was to gather user assessments along four main dimensions. These dimensions, and the corresponding questions, or statements, are summa-rised bellow: Stability and reliability Effectiveness and accuracy Efficiency Usability and layout
The above statements were complemented with general questions about the user and an evaluation of the usefulness of the tools and tabs on the interface. 5.2. Results
Although all subscribed users 21 were invited to complete the survey, only 14 of them actually did. There is a number of sub-scribers that have not got around to using the system and one possible reason is that it is not compatible with Internet Explorer. Furthermore, we did not force any of our invited users to complete the questionnaire, so we expected that not all of our real users would do. The 14 evaluators were mostly those that had the internet skills and culture and were attracted by the system enough to use it frequently, within the evaluation period. This is of course a limited user sample, but nevertheless provides indi-cations of the system X  X  effectiveness and usability. The lessons learned from this first limited user study will help us to further refine the system and also to conduct a more extensive evaluation in the future.

The complete survey results can be found at http://www.lisys.gr/results . Here we summarise the results regarding the system X  X  effectiveness and usability. The users were in general satisfied by the system X  X  stability and reliability. During the evaluation period the system was down for just 1 day, due to a loss of internet connection. We also dealt promptly with the few reported minor glitches and so, stability and reliability is no longer an issue. Since the beginning of the evaluation period the system continues to run successfully until today. Its efficiency has also been satisfactory. Ten users answered  X  X  X ery much X  to the question  X  X  X re you satisfied by Noos response times? X  and four users answered  X  X  X uch X . Of course, the system X  X  stability, reliability and efficiency will be really challenged when the number of users that concurrently access it, increases significantly.

The users evaluated positively the system X  X  effectiveness and accuracy. Fig. 8 presents the users X  answers for the first three questions concerning these dimensions. The answers to the fourth question on the overall system effectiveness are Only two users reported false positives. However, according to the results, false negatives, i.e., relevant stories lower in the list, were more frequent ( Fig. 8 (middle)). As already discussed in Section 4.2, one possible reason is the bias that mistakenly extracted noise words cause towards the source most frequently visited. As one user commented, relevant stories from less visited feeds may appear lower in the ordered list under the tab  X  X  X y score X . The user can overcome this issue, using the  X  X  X y source X  tab, because the ordering of items within each feed is not affected by the noise words that the feed X  X  web pages pro-duce in common. Nevertheless, the above problem raises the issue of adequate HTML parsing for extracting only those words that correspond to the web page X  X  content.

A similar bias may occur in the case of a user interested in multiple topics. For example, if a user has provided feeds on  X  X  X cience X  and  X  X  X ports X , but reads science stories more regularly than sports stories, then the ordered list can become biased towards the topic of  X  X  X cience X . The fact that the profile reflects the level of interest in each topic is not undesirable. Never-theless, the problem of false negatives implies that a single ranked list of information items cannot accommodate multiple topics of interest. A different interface is required, which allows users to categorise feeds according to topic of interest.
The results on Nootropia X  X  ability to learn have been particularly good (Fig. 8 (right)). All but one user recognised that the system was learning their interests. Experience shows that it does not take more than reading a couple of items for the sys-tem to produce a list with relevant items at the top. Nootropia X  X  adaptation speed is an advantage that could prove important in a real situation involving many users.

The users X  assessment of the system X  X  usability and layout was not equally positive. According to Fig. 9 , two out of 14 users faced difficulties in using the system and the help facility did not solve the problem. Four out of 14 users were not satisfied by the layout and overall ( Fig. 10 (right)), six users stated that the system is not that easy to use. As this was an experimental effort, we were aware of the interface X  X  limitations. However, the difference in the user assessment of the system X  X  effective-ness and usability shows that IF is not purely an algorithmic problem. An accurate IF model is not by itself enough to attract the necessary user involvement. It has to be wrapped in an adequate interface. Search engines have a well established inter-available online, there is no agreement yet on an appropriate interface design. Research in IF has focused mainly on improving effectiveness. However, an increase in filtering accuracy by a couple of percentage units is probably less important than the significant interface issues, which have to be resolved for applying IF successfully in a real situation. Our user study reveals that, unlike those in a search engine, the interface requirements of an IF system are more demanding. It has to be regularly visited by users with long term interest in a variety of topics and to continuously satisfy their information needs.
Finally, the study shows that IF should not be treated in isolation, but it could be integrated in a broader web application, which provides a series of information services. The users found many of the system X  X  tabs and tools helpful. Eleven out of 14 users completed the relevant portion of the questionnaire. Fig. 11 presents the average score assigned to each tab and tool (scores were 1 for worst to 6 for best). For example, after the  X  X  X y News X  and the  X  X  X onfiguration X  tabs, the  X  X  X ag cloud X  tab has received the highest score. Apparently, users found that being able to organise already viewed items, using tags for future reference, very useful. Consequently, the  X  X  X iewed X  tab became obsolete. It is also interesting that the worst scoring tab was the  X  X  X ost popular X  and the worst scoring tool the  X  X  X mail X . This means that the users did not develop the sense of community. 6. Summary and future work
Content-based IF could play a significant role for online content personalisation. However, and despite the relevant re-search, no successful application of content-based IF is available on the web. This paper describes our attempt to develop a real world web applications based on Nootropia, an immune-inspired user profiling model for adaptive, content-based IF. Unlike existing approaches, Nootropia has the ability to effectively represent a user X  X  multiple topics of interest with a single user profile that continuously adapts to a variety of changes in them. It is therefore possible to achieve an integrated solution to adaptive IF, where a single profile is responsible for evaluating incoming information from various sources according to the changing interests of a user, or a community. We described the architecture, implementation, usage and evaluation of the Personalised News and Paper Aggregator, which uses Nootropia to evaluate the relevance of information items (news stories, or scientific papers), deriving from user specified RSS feeds, and generates a list of items ordered by decreasing relevance score. The web application was enhanced with various tools, which facilitated the user to find relevant information, organise it and even share it.

To evaluate the Personalised News and Paper Aggregator, we performed a study involving real users. Users with a variety of backgrounds and internet skills were invited to use the system and, after a testing period of about two months, they were prompted to complete a questionnaire. The users were satisfied by Nootropia X  X  ability to learn their interests and by its fil-tering accuracy. The existence of false negatives was attributed to  X  X  X oise X  words and to the inadequacy of a single list of items to accommodate multiple topics of interest. Despite the system X  X  effectiveness, there were users that found it difficult to interact with the system. This shows that creating an appropriate interface for an IF system is not that straightforward. Researchers in IF should take interface issues into account, if they wish to develop applications which are attractive to real users. IF is a complicated problem with many interrelated aspects affecting its success, or failure, and it should be treated as such.

We gained a lot of valuable experience in our attempt to develop a real world IF application, and this experience is informing our future steps. We are working on a variety of improvements affecting many system aspects. Our end goal is to develop a larger scale web application that will serve the information, communication and collaboration needs of an on-line community. The system will combine private profiles with collective profiles and will implement a series of personal-isation services which, in addition to the services described here, will include: personalised search that uses the user profile to evaluate the search results, recommendations based on the common interests of community members, expert finding that matches a user X  X  request to the profiles of peers and identifies those with relevant expertise. Towards this end, many issues will keep us occupied.
