 This paper quantitatively analyzes indicators of Agent (policy seller), Adjuster (indemnity claim adjuster), Producer (policy purchaser/holder) indemnity behavior suggestive of collusion in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA) national crop insurance program. According to guidance from the federal law and using six indicator variables of indemnity behavior, those entities equal to or exceeding 150% of the county mean (computed using a simple jackknife procedure) on all entity-relevant indicators were flagged as "anomalous." Log linear analysis was used to test (I) hierarchical node-node arrangements and (2) a non-reeursive model of node information sharing. Chi-square distributed deviance statistic identified the optimal log linear model. The results of the applied data mining technique used here suggest that the non-recursive triplet and Agent-producer doublet collusion probabilistically accounts for the greatest proportion of waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal crop insurance program. Triplet and Agent-producer doublets need detailed investigation for possible collusion. Hence, this data mining technique provided a high level of confidence when 24 million records were quantitatively analyzed for possible fraud, waste, or other abuse of the crop insurance program administered by the USDA RMA, and suspect entities reported to USDA. This data mining technique can be applied where vast amounts of data are available to detect patterns of collusion or conspiracy as may be of interest to the criminal justice or intelligence agencies.

Agents were probably the 'hub' of the cart wheel. Adjusters were probably the' spokes' of the cart wheel, connecting 
Agents and Producers in the conspiracy model of crop insurance waste, fraud, and abuse. Finally, Producers were posited to be the 'rim' of the cart wheel, completing the common model of conspiracy in which collusion of few is connected to actions of many by some intermediary. Typically, investigation of conspiracy originates from a qualitative analysis of individual instances. Such efforts are time consuming and identifying instances of fraud rely largely upon luck rather than objective analyses. In the current analysis, data mining was applied to the USDA RMA 'national book of insurance business' for the year 2000 to quantify conspiracy investigation. The working hypothesis was the 'cart wheel metaphor' of linked anomalous business transactions at the Agent, Adjuster, and Producer levels was performed seeking evidence for linked behaviors suggestive of collusion. The use of data mining tools and techniques for insurance fraud detection has been clearly documented in the literature. Yeo [1], for example, documented its usefulness when he described a U.S. health insurance company using data mining techniques to compare an individual doctor's claims against a larger historical base of data. The analysis identified several geographical areas where claims exceed the norm. The insurance firm investigated and confirmed that a physician in an area was submitting false bills. As a result, the doctor was forced to pay restitution and fines. Data mining saved this health insurance company as much as $4 million. Grossman et al [2] have indicated that fraud detection is one of the areas where data mining is considered a "successful" tool. He et al [3]. showed how data mining through neural networks could be used to detect medical fraud. Several recent publications have documented the usefulness of data mining techniques for fraud detection in health and automobile insurance claims.[ 1,4-9] Most ofthese papers mention the large amount of potential savings in human investigative resources and indemnity payments when using data mining tools. The literature indicates that there are two main data mining techniques used in insurance fraud detection. A predominant data mining technique used in the detection of fraudulent claims are straightforward statistical techniques. Weisberg and Derrig [9] have used linear regression models to analyze the statistical significance of fraud indicators in bodily injury claims in Massachusetts. Other investigators developed a model and an expert system that can detect potentially fraudulent claims based on a probit model using a number of fraud indicators. [ 10,11 ] The second main data mining technique used in insurance fraud detection is clustering algorithms. Derrig and Oztaszewski[12] used fuzzy set theories to classify and identify characteristics of fraudulent claims. They found that fuzzy techniques could efficiently classify claims based on the suspected fraudulent content. Brockett, Xia, and Derrig [13], on the other hand, apply neural networks and back-propagation algorithms to cluster claims based on the degree of fraud suspicion. They demonstrated that this data mining technique performs better than the combination of an premium, indemnity, and liability were computed using six with the ARPA, county means were computed using the generalized jackknife procedure. [17,18] The generalized jackknife is used for the purpose of reducing bias in manipulations were performed in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The statistical program R was used to perform the log linear analysis. [21 ] Log linear analysis is appropriate to this research problem because it provides a flexible mechanism for the analysis of Poisson distributed count data (i.e., number flagged vs. number not flagged). The name log linear comes from the Table 1. Derived Measures (Means Calculated by Derived Measure Ratio 1 = $ Indemnity / $ Premium Ratio 2 = $ Indemnity / $ Liability Ratio 3 = # Loss Policies / Total # Sold Agent Ratio 4 = # Loss Units / Total # Units Ins. Ratio 5 = $ Adjusteri / $ County Indemnity Ratio 6 = # Claims for Adjusteri / use of a logarithmic transform to convert a multiplicative model into a linear one. For example, the standard null hypothesis in Pearson's g2 test for a 2 dimensional contingency table tests for independence of row and column classifications and is given as: Taking the log of H0 gives: Hence the label log linear. The tnJe power of the technique is the ability to apply standard linear modeling techniques such as continuous as well as discrete covariates and the ability to specify a more complex model using a combination of discrete covariates, continuous covariates, and interactions between covafiates. The log linear model results presented in this paper were performed using the glm0 function of R to solve the Generalized Linear Model specified and the resulting measure of model adequacy, or goodness of fit, is the Deviance which is a -2 log likelihood measure and, therefore, Z2 distributed. A detailed explanation of Generalized Linear Models is published. [16,22] Pearson correlation coefficient between entity pairings is the the correlation based upon data for both variables grouped in classes or categories (i.e., "flagged" vs. "not flagged") Log linear analysis of anomalous entities (Agents, Adjusters, and Producers) was employed to test various hypotheses of paths of association, not causation. Table 3 (a) is the model suggested by investigators who work in the crop insurance program, Agent-Adjuster-Producer. It was a statistically significant model for the observations. A model that is a statistically 'better fit is the Agent-Producer-Adjuster linkage (Table 3 (b)). However, of the three hierarchical models possible in the classic conspiracy analysis, Adjuster-Agent-Producer is the optimal statistical fit (Best Fit) for the data. Thus, the associations shown are not precisely those suggested by conspiracy investigators who work in the crop insurance program, but do follow the classically described Table 2. Frequencies of Agents, Adjusters, and Producers Entity Anomalous Not Anomalous Total Producers Agents 4,203 9,231 13,434 Adjusters 1,128 2,716 3,844 Doublets Agent-ProdLucer Agent-Adjuster Adjuster-producer Triplet Adjuster-Agent-Producer Total number of policies = 1,002,409; Percent with Indemnity = 26.8% (268,158/1,002,409) conspiracy model. The path Adjuster-Agent-Producer was the log linear best fit for the hierarchical association model. The best possible fit with the three entities, Adjuster-Agents-Producers, was a non-recursive triplet (Table 3 (d)). The non-recursive triplet indicates that there is not a true hierarchy as in a classic conspiracy, but there is significant sharing of information among all three entities. The strongest relationship is between Producers and Agents in the entire data set, whether or not they are anomalous (r = 0.20). This indicates an R 2 of 4% from the correlation ofr = 0.20. The best overall fit for the model was as shown in Table 3 (d). The second best fit was the Agent-Producer doublet. The biserial correlation of all Agent-Producers was, of course, at 0.20. The best possible fit with the three entities, Adjuster-Agents-Producers, was a non-recursive triplet (Table 3 (d)). The non-recursive triplet indicates that there is not a true hierarchy as in a classic conspiracy, but there is significant sharing of information among all three entities. The strongest relationship is between Producers and Agents in the entire data set, whether or not they are anomalous (r = 0.20). This indicates an R 2 of 4% from the correlation ofr = 0.20. The best overall fit for the model was as shown in Table 3 (d). The second best fit was the Agent-Producer doublet.
