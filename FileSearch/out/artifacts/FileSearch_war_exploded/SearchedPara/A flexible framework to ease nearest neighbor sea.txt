Formally speaking, the fs-distance used in the nn-search algorithm is defined by d : X X ! R feature space domain, usually X  X  R n .
 Let X i be the domain where the i th-feature is drawn. Thus, the feature space can be defined as X  X  vectors representing the objects of the database where similarity searching is done. The two typical queries used to do nn-search inside the feature space are formally defined as follows: NN  X  ~ q  X  X f ~ o 2 U : 8 ~ x 2 U d  X  ~ q ; ~ o  X  6 d  X  ~ q ; ~ x  X g d  X  ~ q ; ~ o  X  6 d  X  ~ q ; ~ x  X  .
 the former one.

The distance from the query point to a region is a ptor-distance that, ideally, it is defined as where ~ p 2 X , N is an index node and R N denotes the region covered by N . Obviously, d ptor-distance function.

 the definition of approximation distances and prune conditions to be used in the search algorithms. 4.1. fs-Distances constraints
Traditionally [12], a distance is defined as a function d : X X ! R (1) d  X  x ; y  X  P 0 (2) d  X  x ; y  X  X  0 () x  X  y (3) d  X  x ; y  X  X  d  X  y ; x  X  (4) d  X  x ; z  X  6 d  X  x ; y  X  X  d  X  y ; z  X  8 x ; y ; z 2 X erties 1, 2 and 3, it is called semi-metric , so this is the name we use in the rest of the paper. With the main goal of providing a general definition about fs-distances and having in mind that X  X  that each fs-distance is defined in terms of distances for each X where F : R n ! R  X  measures the proximity between points in every dimension.
Distance in X i is usually measured by means of j p i q i required to be a distance, in fact, it could return negative values.
However, 8 x ; y 2 X i every d i must satisfy two basic requirements: (1) d i  X  x ; y  X  X  0 () x  X  y (2) either d i  X  x ; y  X  X  d i  X  y ; x  X  P 0 (prop. 2.a) or d dratic form distances.
 Following this, we introduce some concepts in order to define the fs-distance constraints.
Definition 4.1. Let f : R n ! R  X  (1) We define in R n an f-ball with radius r (2) We say that an f-ball with radius r is bounded if 9 ~ (3) f is a bounded ball function if f -balls with finite radius are bounded. (5) We say that f is a uniformly scaled function if f  X  k ~ p  X  X  s  X  k  X  f  X  ~ p  X  8 k 2 R s  X  k  X  X  k 2 the ball size increases in a quadratic way.
 two multidimensional points, specifically  X  ~ inf f  X  r  X  ; non-bounded balls, it is not difficult to adapt our proposal to solve this specific case.
If d  X  ~ p ; ~ q  X  X  f  X  d 1  X  p 1 ; q 1  X  ; ... ; d n  X  p f  X  p ; ... ; p n  X  X  f  X  p 1 ; ... ; p n  X  .
It is obvious that if f is symmetric and it is a bounded ball function, then 8 a ; b ; c 2 Da 6 b 6 c then j d  X  a ; b  X j 6 j d  X  a ; c  X j and j d  X  b ; c  X j
Definition 4.4 ( fs-distance ). Let X  X  Q n i  X  1 X i be a multidimensional space. Let d where (1) F : R n ! R  X  , (2) d fs is a semi-metric defined on X , (3) every d i is X i -order consistent for 1 6 i 6 n , (4) F is a bounded ball function, (5) F is a uniformly scaled function.

Then, we say that d fs is a fs-distance in X . 4.2. The approximation ptor-distance of the fs-distance that we call sbb-distance . Like L 1 distance the s mallest b ounding b oxes that enclose the similarity distance balls, as Fig. 4 shows. example, in Fig. 4 we can see a two-dimensional ball with radius 1 for a Euclidean weighted distance, defined by dimensions is respectively 1 = 6 and 1 = 2. But it happens that the rectangle defined by the two points  X  ~ inf d  X  1  X  ;
So that an fs-distance d defined in terms of its component distances  X  d weight vector: We are ready now to introduce the distance that we use to approximate an fs-distance.
Definition 4.5 ( sbb-distance ). The sbb-distance associated with an fs-distance d is where (1) d  X  ~ p ; ~ q  X  X  F  X  d 1  X  p 1 ; q 1  X  ; ... ; d n  X  p (2) ~ w  X  X  w 1 ; ... ; w n  X 2 R n  X  is the weight vector associated to d , which can be expressed as  X  (3) s is the scale ratio associated with F (Definition 4.1 ) framework. whose balls enclose those of the fs-distances.

Theorem 4.1. Let d fs be an fs-distance and let d sbb be its associated sbb-distance, then
Proof. d fs  X  ~ p ; ~ q  X  X  F  X  d 1  X  p 1 ; q 1  X  ; ... ; d We will prove that F 0  X  ~ x  X  6 F  X  ~ x  X  8 ~ x 2 R n .
 Let ~ x 2 R n , since s is a bijective function, there exists k 2 R such that s  X  k  X  X  F  X  ~ x  X  . Consider then ~ y  X  1 k ~ x .

We know that inf F  X  1  X  i 6 y i 6 sup F  X  1  X  i for 1 6 i
If every d i satisfies property 2.a then 0 6 y i 6 sup F  X  1  X 
Conversely, if every d i satisfies property 2.b then F is a symmetric function and then
Hence, it is always true that j y i j 6 j sup F  X  1  X  i j and so j
As s is a non-decreasing function, then defined by:
Then, one of the following sentences is true: (1) 9 ~ x 2 R n such that F 0  X  ~ x  X  &gt; F  X  ~ x  X  , (2) 8 ~ x 2 R n we have that F 0  X  ~ x  X  6 F  X  ~ x  X  .

Proof. Two situations can bring about that ~ w 0  X  ~ w (1) 9 1 6 j 6 n such that w 0 j &gt; w j
In this case, F 0 is not a lower bound of F . (2) 8 1 6 i 6 n we have that w 0 i 6 w i

By Lemma 4.1 , we conclude that either d box is not a lower bound of d ditions for the similarity search algorithms) or d box  X  ~ p ; ~ q  X  associated balls. h function for an fs-distance. 5.

Definition 5.2 ( Internal distance ). Let ~ p 2 X be a multidimensional point and let H  X  X  internal distance between ~ p and H is where hole defined by H . [16] and Q-tree [17]. Specifically, this definition does not affect indexes like R-tree family ones. sible topological relationship between a query point and a region. as: d min . Lemma 5.1 and Theorem 5.1 prove finally that.

Lemma 5.1. Let ~ p 2 X be a multidimensional point and let R be a rectangle defined in X . Then (1) d ext  X  ~ p ; R  X  6 d sbb  X  ~ p ; ~ q  X  for ~ q 2 R (2) d int  X  ~ p ; R  X  6 d sbb  X  ~ p ; ~ q  X  for ~ q R R
Proof (1) If ~ p is inside R then d ext  X  ~ p ; R  X  X  0 and obviously d (2) If ~ p is outside R then d int  X  ~ p ; R  X  X  0 and obviously d
The following theorem can be used to affirm that d aprox is a lower bound of d
Theorem 5.1. Let ~ p 2 X and let R N be a rectangular region in X with or without holes, then
Proof. (1) If ~ p is inside R N then d aprox  X  ~ p ; R N  X  X  0 and obviously (2) If ~ p is outside R N there are two possibilities:
Applying Theorem 4.1 we have that
Considering this result and the definition of d min , we obviously obtain that
Summarizing, we have shown the utility of sbb-distance for building a lower bound of d restrictive, and thus the user has a high degree of freedom to choose the appropriate fs-function. 6. Cases of use
Although the fs-distance may be very complex and it may have a high computational price, the cost for calculating and so its complexity is not significant for the whole search process. artificial vision.
 approach. (1) The distance must be checked in order to satisfy fs-distance constraints. (2) The weight vector and the scale ratio must be determined in order to define the associated sbb-distance . (3) The sbb-distance must be used to define external and internal distances. (4) d aprox (Definition 5.3 ) is defined from external and internal distance. (5) Now, in Algorithm 1 we should replace d min by d aprox over two well-known distance families: Minkowski and Quadratic form distances. 6.1. Minkowski distances tical balls. When the weights of each dimension are equal, this family includes well-known L ean  X  L 2  X  or Manhattan  X  L 1  X  distance.

A general definition for these distances is: where ~ p ; ~ q 2 X  X  Q n i  X  1 X i are multidimensional points, c i &gt; 0 is a constant used to weight i th dimension, and w i : X i X i ! R  X  is a function that satisfies property 2a, i.e. w  X  1 6 i 6 n ).
 The value of k determines the specific distance in the collection. Recall that: If k P 1 then d k is a metric.

Thus, we can affirm: (1) d k is a semi-metric by means of its own definition (2) Every w i is X i -order consistent by means of its own definition (3) F is a bounded ball function:Assume that ~ q 2 B F  X  b  X  , then (4) F is a uniformly scaled function since, for ~ p 2 R n
In fact, F is lineal scaled since the scale ratio is the identity function, i.e. s  X  a  X  X  a . 2. The weight vector and the scale ratio.Since ~ sup F  X  b  X  X  b mum distance:
