 Context influences the search process, but to date research has not definitively identified which aspects of context are the most influential for information retrieval, and thus are worthy of integration in today X  X  retrieval systems. In this research, we isolated for examination two aspects of context: task and document genre and examined the relationship between them within a software engineering work domain. In this domain, the nature of the task has an impact on decisions of relevance and usefulness, and the document collection contains a distinctive set of genre. Our data set was a document repository created and used by our target population. The document surrogates were meta-tagged by purpose and document type. Correspondence analysis of this categorical data identified some specific relationships between genres and tasks, as well as four broad dimensions of variability underlying these relationships. These results have the potential to inform the design of a contextual retrieval system by refining search results for this domain.
 H.3.3 Information Search and Retrieval: information filtering, selection process Measurement, Design contextual information retrieval, correspondence analysis, work tasks, genre, enterprise search Context plays a powerful role in shaping how people search for information and in determining what information they select and use [1-3]. By making use of context, retrieval systems will be able to filter and/or rank information with a higher degree of specificity than is possible using the traditional  X  X ag of words X  approach. The capability to provide targeted search results becomes increasingly important as the amount of information available within organizations and publicly on the Internet is growing so rapidly as to be overwhelming to the average searcher. Thus, it is not surprising that contextual search has recently risen to the top of the research agenda for information retrieval [4]. However, context is a very broad concept, and researchers in this field have not yet identified a concrete set of contextual factors that influence search behaviour, nor have they identified how these factors influence search. Our research is part of a larger study that is developing an approach to contextual search in the workplace. As part of the larger study, we c onducted interviews with the target population  X  software engineering consultants  X  to understand which broad contextual factors influence how they search for and select information [5]. Emanating from that analysis were a discrete set of contextual variables, the most significant of which were work tasks and information tasks of searchers and genres -document types based on similarity of form and purpose. In this paper, we report on the next stage of the project: a focused analysis of these contextual factors. We hypothesized that a relationship exists between searchers X  tasks and document genres. We believe that such a relationship can be exploited by an IR system to contribute to more precise results. Our goal was to test the relationship between these variables and to explore and identify more specific relationships and patterns of association between these variables. One area where contextual search has the potential to make a major contribution is in improving workplace search systems, or enterprise search . Enterprise search is a technical challenge due to the range of unstructured and structured data types and storage mechanisms in use, the paucity of hyperlinks, and complex security considerations within organizations [6, 7]. Due to the proprietary nature of most organizational information spaces, it has been difficult for researchers to gain access to large document collections in order to conduct research, so there is relatively little research data available. However, it seems that the smaller size and well-defined topic and task domains of organizational information spaces, as compared with the Internet, make them particularly suited to implementations of contextual search.
