 Chengdu, Sichuan, China 1. Introduction systems. More sensors are employed to acquire information t o catch the exact characteristics for the systems. With the development of data acquisition systems, computer science and sensor techniques, challenges to deal with the problem of massive information b y effective methods. Therefore, a lot of higher-level information fusion based on semantic knowled ge networks composed of simulated spiking neurons. The semantic networks had been organized into know ledge network modules, each of which represented a given domain of knowledge. However, when more realistic and complex situations appear, the method needs more options to represent corresponding re lationships among evidence. Perlovsky [2] communication of cognition-language systems. Yue [3] prop osed a collision detection system consisting hierarchical knowledge structures. Kamberova [5] present ed an approach of information fusion based constraints of the source axioms of probability, the constr uction of the priori database becomes very to Bayes theory, such as Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence the ory [8], fuzzy sets theory and possibility theory [9 X 11].

D-S evidence theory is proposed based on the research of Demp ster [8]. The advantage of the method of D-S evidence theory can combine the evidence obtained fro m different evidence sources to update federative framework, evidence theory is suitable to take i nto account the disparity of the knowledge uncertain data associated with no exclusive hypotheses. Be cause D-S evidence theory is more adaptive diagnosis [16], knowledge discovery [17], and so on.
 rule might produce counter-intuitive results (also named c ombination paradox) when highly conflicting evidence occur. Many scholars have made some efforts to solv e the issue. Yager [19] proposed an reasonable than that of D-S evidence theory in dealing with t he combination paradox. However, it is evidence. Dubois and Prade [20] investigated the combining uncertain evidence stemming from several conflict and conflict evidence. Lefevre [22] thought that con flict management was a major problem family of combination operators had been defined. Moreover, a generic framework for the fusion of information sources modeled has presented by means of belie f mass functions. The average rule of combination proposed by Murphy [23] was just to average all t he BPAs of relevant hypothesis to get new belief assignments. However, the method proposed by Mur phy cannot generate a desired belief convergence. Chen [24] presented a modified averaging metho d to combine conflicting evidence based even if belief convergence performance may be accepted, (b) the reason to employ evidence distance for removing evidence conflict is not explained clearly, and (c) the efficiency of the algorithm needs improvement.

Based on the above review, the conflict issue has not yet been s olved very well. It should be noted conflict reason with the desire to modify the traditional D-S evidence theory is concerned and a novel The rest of the paper is organized as below. D-S evidence theo ry is briefly introduced in Section 2. in D-S evidence theory are investigated in Section 4. A novel information fusion method is proposed in Section 5. Comparison studies are performed in Section 6. Co nclusions are presented at last. 2. A brief introduction of D-S evidence theory
D-S evidence theory is represented by a finite nonempty exhau stive set of mutually exclusive possi-subsets of  X  . There are 2 n elements in 2  X  , if  X  has n elements. Let q where  X  denotes the empty set. The subsets  X  , { q singletons.
 0, P m ( X ) = 0 means that the existing evidence supports no element of the domain. m ( X ) = 1 states that an existing evidence only supports X in the domain. P evidence. Here it should be noted that Smets proposed the ope n world assumption (OWA) and considered concentrates on CWA.
 Definition 2. Belief function ( Bel ): X on the probability of X [8]. Definition 3. Plausibility function ( P l ) : an upper limit function on the probability of X [13,26]. Moreover,
The fusion of multiple evidence can be performed by the Demps ter X  X  combination rule that is defined as follow. Given two Basic probability assignment function s m combination rule can be defined by where m Let where K evidence. 0 6 K opinion. An example is employed to illustrate the implement ation of Dempster X  X  combination rule. Let S Example 1. Assume two sources of evidence S BPAs are shown in Table 1. A , B , and AB are all the propositions discussed in this example.
According to Eq. (5), m ( A ) = 0.61, m ( B ) = 0.35, m ( AB ) = 0.03 are obtained, respectively. The conflict factor K called brief convergence.
 3. Stochastic interpretation for BPAs
With the brief review of D-S evidence theory, it can be gained that a body of evidence represents the dealed with by elementary vector algebra.
 Definition 4. Probability vector ( p ) : p = ( p
According to the definition of a BPA, it can be received that a B PA is a special case of probability vector which have 2 n elements and can be noted as m = ( m ( X ) , m ( X Consequently, the elements of m satisfy: X i  X  2 Definition 5. Probability unit vector ( e is called probability unit vector.

In the application of D-S evidence theory to information fus ion, the best result is expected to be a set  X  and belief is distributed in the power set of  X  , the probability unit vector is changed to Definition 6. Stochastic matrix ( P ) : theory can fuse multiple sources of evidence and every sourc e information of evidence is expressed by the BPA function. Consequently, every source of evidence ca n be used as a row of Stochastic matrix. The BPAs of k independent sources of evidence can form k  X  2 n Stochastic matrix. This matrix is also called as the mass Stochastic matrix which can be denoted as M .

The matrix M characterizes all information available of evidence sourc e which has to be combined to solve the fusion problem. D-S combination rule can be applie d to combine k rows of M to get fusion result. Simultaneously, it is easy to analyze the relation b etween different sources of evidence. 4. The effects of BPA difference to both belief convergence a nd evidence conflict
Based on the analysis in Section 2, it can be noticed that the e vidence theory can get more precise evidence. It should be noted that when the opinions of eviden ce are different, evidence conflict may occur. The combining results obtained by D-S evidence theor y might be wrong correspondingly. This the principles of belief convergence and disclose the reaso n of combination paradox. When the BPAs extended as follows. 4.1. The BPAs of evidence are the same
In this case, the BPAs of all sources of evidence of each same s ubset in the discernment frame are two different sources of evidence. Therefore, the BPA of the pre-combination and post-combination is used to analyze this case.
 Example 2. Let  X  = { A, B, C, D } , two sources of evidence S sources of evidence are given in Table 2, and the mass Stochas tic matrix M 0 . 25 0 . 25 0 . 25 0 . 25 0 . 25 0 . 25 0 . 25 0 . 25
Based on Eqs (5) and (6), m ( A ) = 0.25, m ( B ) = 0.25, m ( C ) = 0.25, m ( D ) = 0.25 and K are obtained respectively. Comparing the updated BPAs with the given BPAs, it can be found that the BPAs have no influence even though more sources of evidence ar e considered when the given BPAs are is no difference among the given evidence BPAs. The desired b elief convergence does not present. In addition, the existing evidence has no conflict in this examp le. However, the K is 0.75. This is inconsistent with the statement that K conflict. 4.2. For each subset, the BPAs of different sources of eviden ce are the same; the BPAs for different This shows that the difference of the BPAs of evidence may be a reason to obtain the updated BPAs. In this case, the row of mass Stochastic matrix M is equal to each other and the rank of M is equal to 1. The BPAs of k independent sources of evidence are the same, m m l ( ) Example 3. Let  X  = { A, B, C } . The BPAs supported by two sources of evidence S in the mass Stochastic matrix M
Based on Eq. (6), K the combined BPAs are changed and brief convergence is gener ated. Moreover, information of two BPA of single evidence. Consequently, it can be received tha t the difference among evidence BPAs is one of the reasons to update BPAs. Simultaneously K this may be concluded that for non-conflict evidence, K 4.3. The evidence BPAs are different for a same subset in a dis cernment frame
When the BPAs of two sources of evidence for a subset in a disce rnment frame are different, the updated BPAs can be obtained. The row of the mass Stochastic m atrix M is unequal to each other and the rank of M is unequal to 1. Example 4 is employed to illustrate this situ ation. Example 4. Let  X  = { A, B, AB } . The BPAs supported by two sources of evidence S shown in the mass Stochastic matrix M
Based on the BPAs in M as m ( A ) = 0.7102, m ( B ) = 0.1449, m ( AB ) = 0.1449 are concluded. It can be gained that m ( A ) supported by two different sources of evidence are updated f rom 0.7 and 0.5 to 0.7102 eventually. It means that the belief of A based on sources of evidence S of the BPAs for a same subset is one of the reasons to update BPA s as well.

Based on the above analysis of three situations, it can be ver ified that the difference among BPAs is completely using the classical Dempster-Shafer X  X  (D-S) co mbination rule. Example 5 can be used to present the situation.
 Example 5. Let  X  = { A, B, C } . The BPAs supported by two sources of evidence S in the mass stochastic matrix M
Using D-S combination rule Eq. (5), K 0.01 and m 1, using the classical D-S combination rule. This means that the opinion with very low belief level such as m great potential to remove the evidence conflict and improve t he capability of information fusion. 5. The proposed combination algorithm 5.1. The novel paradox combination algorithm
The difference of BPAs of subset is useful information for be lief convergence, which is the essential reason of belief convergence using D-S evidence theory to co mbine multiple sources of evidence in with the rational management of the difference of BPAs. Cons equently, this can be proposed that a proposed to depict the conflicting degree between two source s of evidence and express the attribution of evidence and the relative difference factor of two pieces of evidence for a specific hypothesis are defined as below.

 by
If E r 0, it means the BPAs of X it can be proposed to obtain the updated BPAs for the case E and
When E 1.98, E r m ( A ) = 0.4995, m ( B ) = 0.001, and m ( C ) = 0.4995 are obtained. Because the BPAs of two sources of evidence to support hypothesis B are the same and have very small belief contribution, the BPA s to hypothesis B should be less after combination. From the above results, m ( B ) has changed from 0.1 to 0.001. This result shows the novel combination algori thm is more reasonable and rational than D-S combination rule. Simultaneously, because of the same w eight to various evidence, the BPAs to the proposed combination algorithm is effective. 5.2. The novel combination rule or non-conflicting sources, which is proposed by Fan [13]. Si multaneously, the classical D-S combi-sources of evidence, the conflict degree is characterized by the conflict factor K threshold aims to represent the permitted conflict level bet ween two sources of evidence. If K the conflict degree of this evidence relative to the others. F or instance, if K the conflicting group will then be combined with the BPAs in th e non-conflicting group using Eq. (6). to all applications. The choice of  X  also depends on the specific application. In this paper,  X  = 1 6. Comparison studies
To further verify the proposed method, the comparison studi es can be conducted among the proposed method and some current methods such as the traditional D-S c ombination rule, Yager [19] rule, Mur-average BPA. More details can be referred to [19,23,24].
 The example in Ref. [24] is used to analyze and address the com parison studies.

The conflict threshold,  X  = 1 0.6865 is attained. According to Section 5.2, the second sou rce of evidence, S four sources of evidence. Simultaneously, it can be obtaine d that S evidence because the conflict factor K In order to compare, the combination results of S unacceptable because the true fault mode is A . The BPA to A is also ignored by Yager rule based on unknown proposition. The conclusion of Murphy and Chen has b een reasonably compared with that of when there are only two sources of evidence existed, or there are not adequate sources of evidence to make decision that can be obtained with system. Through abov e combination, the new BPAs is given in Matrix M where m between each pair of sources of evidence can be calculated in M K according to Section 5.2. When the evidence S
Because evidence S obtained when three sources of evidence are presented and Mo de A will be recognized. Simultaneously, from Table 5 Yager and D-S combination rule cannot obtain the correct mode. Chen combination rule can get the correct mode, but its belief assignment to Mode A is much smaller than the proposed algorithm. Then, subset A can be identified, which means Mode A exists based on the fusion of evidence S are presented in Table 6, when evidence S 7. Conclusions are demonstrated through the comparison study with other in formation fusion algorithms. It may be to develop an effective indicator for evidence conflict leve l quantification.
