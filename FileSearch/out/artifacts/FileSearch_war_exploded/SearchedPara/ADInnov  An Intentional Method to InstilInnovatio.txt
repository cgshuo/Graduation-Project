 Understanding, modelling and improving Socio-Technical (ST) ecosystems is still a major challenge in different information systems  X  areas such as virtual organizations (VO) [ 1 ], collaborative business processes (choreographies) [ 2 ] or multi-agent systems [ 3 ]. ST ecosystems refers to an intricate ecosystem with a large number of actors playing various and variable functions, diversity of scenarios and special cases, abundance of fl ows, various interaction kinds, etc. [ 4 ]. In particular, when trying to improve ST ecosystems such as healthcare, automating is not always possible and process-oriented approaches are extremely dif fi cult to apply because of the afore-mentioned complexity [ 5 ]. When dealing with human-centred ecosystems, resistance to change is an important risk [ 6 ] and the integration and the mobilization of a wide group of stakeholders to support the potential improvements is critical [ 7 ]. In this context, breakthrough innovations are not always suitable. The innovations must be thought, accepted and ranked collectively. They must ensure the resolution of blocking points that are consensually recognized. In this context, our position is not to offer a method dedicated to innovation projects limited by time and costs and managed by a project team, but rather to instil in the ecosystems  X  heart an innovation culture. This is espe-cially true in the current social innovation dynamics that impact many business ecosystems where traditional stakeholders and newcomers try to reinvent their busi-nesses in order to optimise the  X  highest possible use value for the longest possible time while consuming as few material resources and energy as possible Figure 1 presents a general view of the ADInnov method using the MAP formalism [ 9 ]. MAP models are directed graphs with nodes representing intentions and labelled edges capturing strategies. The main strategies presented in the paper are represented ative cycles As -Is/As -If . The aim is to imagine innovation scenarios based on the question  X  And if?  X  that could be deployed in more or less long terms (even very long terms if the innovation requires legal or economic evolutions). Innovations should therefore be organized in a road map specifying when and how to be deployed. This could introduce new blocking points that require newer iterations implying new analysis and diagnosis and eventually the application of new innovation strategies. The iterative method will stop by choice of the consortium.
 More speci fi cally, the ADInnov method is dedicated to support the analysis and the diagnosis of ST ecosystems as well as to propose consensual innovations. Analysis explores the domain, identi fi es actors and their functions and divides the ecosystem in different views (responsibility networks and concerns) in order to manage its com-plexity. Diagnosis focuses on fi nding blocking points and inferring goals dedicated to resolve them. Innovation proposes organizational innovations (new functions, new groups of actors, etc.) and innovation services. ADInnov arises from the empirical user-centred method used during the InnoServ project 1 ( Innovation in Services for Frail People ). This project aimed to fi nd organizational and low-tech-based solutions to maintain as long as possible frail people at home in total autonomy [ 11 ]. Soon became clear in this project that the traditional work-packages division was not adapted to the project because a common understanding was essential. Instead, we adopted multi-disciplinary workshops with representation of the different partners of the project: the research laboratories, an innovation research federation, an association, a local authority and two private companies. Actors in the fi eld such as physicians, nurses, council administrators or caregivers were integrated in the project progression and put forward essential information to understand and improve the ecosystem.
 extracted and represented as a BPMN business process diagram. In this paper, we aim to abstract and consolidate this previous work so that the method can be applied to other ecosystems. We use here the MAP formalism that allows achieving the desired level of abstraction, to easily support variability and to better represent the intentional considerations of innovative ecosystems, which tend to continuously innovate in an inductive way (based on inductive hypothesis or trials/errors). Moreover, compared to [ 12 ], this paper presents the ecosystem meta-model and a qualitative evaluation that we lead with innovation project managers in order to evaluate the appropriateness of the ADInnov method.
 Section 3 describes the ADInnov method, explaining the three main strategies (Anal-ysis, Diagnosis and Innovation) and illustrating them through the InnoServ ecosystem. In order to prove the quality of the method, Sect. 4 details a qualitative study that we lead with several innovation project-managers (Sect. 4 ). The results of the InnoServ project were also evaluated and prove the ef fi ciency of the method. Related works are presented in Sect. 5 , where we give an overview of different methods, mostly focused on one of the three aforementioned strategies that we propose. Finally, we draw out conclusions and future work in Sect. 6 . This section presents the key concepts used in the ADInnov method. First, Sect. 2.1 gives the de fi nition of the ecosystem according to the key concepts and presents our consideration of innovation in the context of ST ecosystems. Section 2.2 presents the detailed meta-model of an ecosystem and gives an instantiation example using the InnoServ ecosystem. 2.1 Innovation in an Ecosystem Our focus is about intricate ecosystems (Ec) with a large number of actors playing various and variable functions, diversity of scenarios and special cases, abundance of fl ows, various interaction kinds, etc. [ 4 ]. Relying on this de type of physical or legal person who operates under its own business. Note that we call  X  actor  X  a type of actor. For instance,  X  nurse  X  ,or actors. A function (F) corresponds to a skill or responsibility in the Ec involved in the realization of a service. This notion is equivalent to the well-known notion of the business process management domain [ 13 ]. In order to manage the Ec complexity, a decomposition approach is needed [ 14 ]. We propose the concept of responsibility networks (RN) to tackle this problem. A RN is a view on the Ec determined by the proximity (national, regional, individual, etc.) to the target (e.g., the frail person) and the actors involved on it. A concern (C) relates to a cross-cutting issue in the Ec that determines a point of interest of a provided service (e.g., point (BP) corresponds to a concrete problematic in the context of a RN . Several BP can be identi fi ed in a RN . Goals (G) are prescriptive statements about the system, capturing desired states or conditions [ 10 ]. Goals are hierarchically organized, starting from high level goals which can be iteratively re fi ned into sub-goals. Goals do not de fi ne here the intentional process level, but the aim to resolve BP .A service (S) relates to a delivery consisting in the provision of technical and/or intellectual capacity or the provision of useful work for a bene fi ciary. It helps resolving a goal. A service contains a set of concern services (CS) that deals with the different concerns of the service. This leads us to the de fi nition of the As-Is ecosystem that results from the application of the analysis and diagnosis strategies illustrated in Fig. 1 and detailed latter. The As-Is ecosystem is a set of actors , functions , responsibility network , concerns , blocking points and services. We consider a blocking point as a set of goals that resolve it, and a service as a set of concern services: The innovation strategies (Fig. 1 ) transform an ecosystem Ec in an As-If ecosystem by the identi fi cation of a new set of actors ({A  X  }) , functions ({F networks ({RN  X  }) , concerns ({C  X  }) , blocking points ({BP resulting set of blocking points ({ BP  X  } ) should be a subset of the previous one ({ BP} ) or the resulting goals linked to the blocking points ({G  X  previous set ({G}) : The latter statement means that innovation leads to the identi functions, responsibility networks, concerns or services but can also imply removals. For example a possible innovation could be to remove a (type of) actor in the ecosystem. The main objective of innovation, and therefore of our method, is to reach an ecosystem with less blocking points than before, or at least to have less goals to be achieved. Note that the deployment strategies of the imagined innovations can produce new blocking points that will have to be treated in a new iteration of the method. The adoption of risk management methods in the road map strategies could anticipate and therefore limit the introduction of these new blocking points.
 This de fi nition of an Ec (As_Is or As_If) is limited to the objectives of the method. More complex models would be more suited in case of different objectives. For instance, the requirements elicitation of the information system supporting the ecosystem may require the use of more complex modelling languages such as KAOS [ 10 ], URN [ 15 ]ori*[ 21 ]. 2.2 Ecosystem Meta-Model This section presents a generic ecosystem meta-model. Figures 2 and 3 capture the meta-model and provide two instantiation examples based on the InnoServ ecosystem. As a reminder, the InnoServ project seeks to understand and support innovation strategies and services around a frail person at home. Figure 2 instantiates actors , functions , responsibility networks and concerns . The latter ones are inspired from an organizational meta-model proposed by Russell et al. [ 13 ]. An actor can be quali several functions and a function can be played by several actors. Figure 2 shows that a nurse and a physician are both health professionals (the explanation of the de functions is out of the scope of this paper, a more detailed information about the InnoServ functions is found in [ 1 ]). Responsibility networks (RN) are represented as ellipsis more or less close to the frail person. RNs can be composed of other RNs. In the InnoServ ecosystem, the following responsibility networks are identi which deals with new laws and rules concerning home care for frail people; Coordi-nation , which deals with home care organization for frail people; and Execution, which focuses on the direct interaction with the frail person. Seven concerns were identi Social , Medical , Human Resources , Technological , Financial , Legal and Strategic . Several functions can be necessary in a RN and zero or more functions can be part of it. An actor can be involved in several RNs and a RN can have several actors. Figure 3 presents the notions of blocking point and goal , both related to responsi-bility network . An example of blocking point for the Execution RN is: identi fi cation problems for the care activity  X  , which is translated in a positive form (  X 
Identify function  X  ). Figure 3 shows an excerpt of the execution goal model. Note that the root and the fi rst level goals respectively correspond to the responsibility network and the blocking points. Figure 3 also gives an example of services and concern ser-vices . The re fi nement of the blocking points results in a set of goals that overtake the blocking points. The meta-model also shows that a concern service is performed by zero or more functions and treats one concern in the context of one service. Figure 3 illus-trates the service:  X  Improve the recognition and salary of healthcare acts recognition points out a human resource concern ( recognition of the caregiver status ) and a fi nancial concern ( increase salary or tax reduction for caregivers ).
 The concepts presented in this section are generic terms that can be considered independent from the InnoServ ecosystem and transposable to other domains. We detail the three main sections presented in Fig. 1 that give the name to the ADInnov method: Analysis , Diagnosis and Innovation . The other sections presented in Fig. 1 (concerning road map and deployment) have not yet been studied in detail because they need long term implementation. For each section, application examples in the context of the InnoServ project are presented. 3.1 Analysis of the Ecosystem strategies &gt; of Fig. 1 . This section analyses the As-Is ecosystem. The results expected for this phase are: the characterization of the elements in the ecosystem ( glossary of terms ), a list of actors and their functions , a views separation in order to manage complexity ( responsibility networks and concerns ), and the services provided by the ecosystem. The resulting model corresponds to the one presented in Fig. 2 . Table 1 summarizes the main sections highlighted in Fig. 4 with thicker arrows. 3.2 Diagnosis of the Ecosystem Ecosystem , by diagnosis strategies &gt; of Fig. 1 . This section corresponds to the diag-nosis of the As-Is ecosystem. The results of the diagnosis should provide insights about the major blocking points and the elicitation of goals in order to achieve them . Table 2 summarizes the main sections highlighted in Fig. 5 with thicker arrows.
 3.3 Design Innovations Ecosystem, by innovation strategies &gt; of Fig. 1 . This section corresponds to the design of the innovations in the As-Is ecosystem in order to reach the As-If ecosystem. The results expected for this phase are a set of services that help achieving the goals de in the previous phase (each service responds to a speci fi alterations on the ecosystem) and a set of organizational innovations in terms of alterations of the actors, functions, responsibility networks or concerns. In the InnoServ ecosystem, several organizational changes were proposed, such as the introduction of new functions. For example, we proposed the new function of Orchestrator that uses the resources near the frail person and performs the prescription services for a frail person. New functions imply extending the prerogatives of some actors. Nurses, for instance, could become orchestrators. Table 3 summarizes the main sections high-lighted in Fig. 6 with thicker arrows.
 We evaluated the ADInnov method thanks to a qualitative methodology recommended by sociology and also by computer designers: the semi-structured interviews [ 17 ]. We conducted 8 interviews with senior researches that lead innovation projects such as the Nexus project 2 , focused on the identi fi cation of innovations in eco-districts or the ACIC project 3 focused on the improvement of knowledge absorptive capacity for innovation projects in collaborative SMEs networks. Table 4 shows the evaluation protocol, where we asked subjects to face the evaluation with an innovation project in mind. Data was gathered following an interview grid, where we asked subjects about the appropriateness of the proposed formalism and the proposed intentions, strategies and results. Due to the lack of space, we summarize the important points of the results. The evaluation permitted to validate important aspects of the method but also highlighted some limits. A good point is the support of iterations, as new blocking points could be induced by the proposition of innovations. The simplicity of the MAP formalism was also appreciated. However, three researchers highlighted the dif to follow the models sequencing. The clear link between intentions and the expected results simpli fi ed the method understanding. Subjects highlighted the necessity to de fi ne different categories of blocking points (ex. fi nancial, cultural, dysfunctions, etc.). In the same line, several researchers pointed out the necessity to analyze the risks as well as the potential opposite goals of the different actors as for example between private, public and associative actors.
 This evaluation con fi rmed the appropriateness of our method, and helped us to understand its value and possible application. Moreover, the subjects described organisational mechanisms in which the method could work as a machine to perma-nently innovate in the ecosystem. The method was seen as a heuristic toolbox that the ecosystem can use in order to continuously think about its future and to ways to make it happen. By enabling this continuous and re process in the ecosystem, ADInnov supports the dissemination of the innovation cul-ture in the organisation. Describing these mechanisms, the subjects characterized some improvement perspectives for the method. In particular, the method should supports characterizing the  X  stop  X  outputs in order to build a roadmap or a strategy that support decision-making when implementing innovations in the ecosystem. These be characterized with regard to the responsibility networks (RN) so we can infer the feasibility framework. For instance the innovations concerning the Execution RN are supposed to be achievable in a short-term perspective involving a reduced number of actors, while outputs concerning the Regulation RN should involve a representative number of actors over a long time period. In addition, it should be possible to char-acterize the innovations depending of their class in terms of  X  infrastructure  X  or  X  fi nancial and legal rules  X  : this classi prioritize the implementation of innovations into the ecosystem. Several domains offer methodological tools that can be used in our method. Some are relevant because of the used language or by the steps they propose. Others propose participative techniques that make sense in our context.
 Domain analysis methods in the Information System  X  s community such as Merise [ 18 ] or SSADM [ 19 ] provide systems  X  analysis techniques relying on sub-problem decomposition. This decomposition is governed by the fl ow of information between the system and its environment or between different actors in the ecosystem. Kang et al. [ 20 ] proposed FODA ( Feature Oriented Domain Analysis ), in order to analyze the scope of the system and the functionality requirements. Goal-modelling approaches such as KAOS [ 10 ], URN [ 15 ], i* [ 21 ] or MAP [ 9 ] are also well known methods to study a system by focusing on its goals or intentions. The aforementioned methods facilitate the understanding of the studied ecosystem, the delimitation and the mod-elling of the domain. They may be useful to improve the system (as they help to understand it). Nevertheless they are limited when it comes to guide innovation. Note that our method is strongly inspired (in terms of concept usage) by the GORE method [ 10 ]. For instance, the term  X  blocking point  X  is similar to the KAOS obstacle [ 22 ]. However, these domain analysis methods focus on information systems requirements engineering, while we focus on innovation in ST ecosystems.
 Multi-agents methods such as DIAMOND [ 23 ] are also considered as analysis methods. The latter proposes a spiral method with the following phases: de the needs , analysis, generic design, and implementation. An interesting point here is the decomposition approach into agents in order to build a system with a bottom-up approach. In our case, we are not in a building-from-scratch approach: the studied ecosystem is already established, like most of the current systems [ 24 ]. In the innovation domain, empirical methods such as CAUTIC [ 16 ] have been proposed. Serious games or focus groups are also commonly used to infer innovations and their effectiveness was already proved in the context of business process manage-ment (BPM) [ 25 ]. Creativity methods [ 26 ] are also well known to help inducing innovations. However, these methods focus in a very speci of innovation. In addition, they do not contemplate a rigorous analysis (and modelling) of the actual system or product. User-centred methodologies Design , Implementation and Testing . These approaches show the bene the end-user in the understanding and co-construction of a complex task. However, these approaches are not generic enough to be adapted to the evolution of ST ecosystems.
 Generic methods in business process management domain promote continuous improvement. The PDCA method (Plan Do Check Act) [ 27 ] or the one described by van der Aalst ( Process Design, System Con fi guration, Process Enactment and Diag-nosis )[ 24 ] are well known examples. In the healthcare domain, Winge et al. [ 5 ] rely on PDCA to propose a generic process that supports care process conglomerations, referring to the tangle of processes around a patient. We think that process oriented approaches are limited for ST ecosystems, where automation is not always possible, in particular for the con fi guration and the enactment phases.
 To resume, to our knowledge, there is no method accompanying iterative inno-vation for ST ecosystems. The ADInnov method mobilizes different methodological tools from different spectrums such as domain analysis, multi-agent, business process management and innovation domains. Understanding and improving ST ecosystems, where many entities interact in different ways and where a lot of special cases exist, is still a great challenge. To overtake this complexity, this paper presents ADInnov , an iterative method that supports the analysis, diagnosis and the design of innovations in such ecosystems. Our goal is to assist the study and guide the improvement of ST ecosystems by instilling an innovation culture that allows the stakeholders to permanently improve the ecosystem. The notion of As-If ecosystem appears to represent an improved vision of the As-Is ecosystem where innovations are introduced in order to resolve blocking points. The As-if ecosystem becomes an As-Is ecosystem when innovations have been deployed. New blocking points may appear implying an iterative process of innovation. This work is the con-solidation and abstraction of an empirical method with the aim of applying it to other innovation projects. The method is represented using the MAP formalism and relies on a generic ecosystem meta-model where blocking points are considered as an inner part. practices used in the InnoServ project. A larger deployment of the method is needed in order to improve it and study its applicability in other ecosystems such as smart-cities and eco-cities. The qualitative evaluation of the method with innovation project managers helped us to position the method with respect to other ecosystems and gave us some valuable clues to improve the method. The current strategies must be com-pleted, in particular by creativity methods [ 26 ]. Road-map and deployment strategies have to be de fi ned by integrating risk management methods. In addition, metrics regarding the resolution of blocking points have to be introduced in order to measure the grade of innovation.
