 Highly interconnected networks with amazingly complex topology describe systems as diverse as the World Wide Web, our cells, social systems or the economy. Recent studies indicate that these networks are the result of self-organizing processes governed by simple but generic laws, resulting in architectural features that makes them much more similar to each other than one would have expected by chance. I will discuss the amazing order characterizing our interconnected world and its implications to network robustness and spreading processes. Finally, most of these ne tworks are driven by the temporal patterns characterizing human activity. I will use communication and web browsing data to show th at there is deep order in the temporal domain of human dynamics, and discuss the different ways to understand and model the emerging patterns.

A Hungarian born native of Transylvania, Romania, he received his Masters in Theoretical Physics at the E X tv X s University in Budapest, Hungary and was awarde d a Ph.D. three years later at Boston University. After a year at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, he join ed Notre Dame as an Assistant Professor, and in 2001 was promoted to Professor and the Emil T. Hofman Chair. Barab X si is the author of Linked: The New Science of Networks, currently available in eleven languages. He is the co-author of Fractal Concepts in Surface Growth (Cambridge, 1995), and the co-editor of The St ructure and Dynamics of Networks (Princeton, 2005). His work lead to the discovery of scale-free networ ks in 1999, and proposed the Barabasi-Albert model to explain their widespread emergence in natural, technological and social sy stems, from the cellular telephone to the WWW or online communities. His work on complex networks have been widely featured in the media, including the cover of Nature, Science News and many ot her journals, and written a bout in Science, Science News, New York Times, USA Today, Washington Post, American Scientist, Discover, Business Week, Die Zeit, El Pais, Le Monde, London X  X  Dail y Telegraph, National Geographic, Th e Chronicle of Higher Education, New Scientist, and La Republica, among others. He has been intervie wed by BBC Radio, National Public Radio, CBS and ABC News, CNN, N BC, and many other media outlets.
