 The beginning of most publications related to MIR (Music Information Retrieval) by content-based audio identification technique discussed the stochastic pattern modeling method based on pitch histogram or spectral envelope histogram which is organized by clustering spectral feature vectors with vector quantization [1]-[4]. However, it is still hard to apply into a very large database since it is no guarantee of scalability and quality adequate to commercial service. Thus, the techniques as mentioned above trend to apply into music classification such as genre or instrument. Since the number of music classes is not abundant in most cases, the stochastic pattern modeling method is easily applied into music classification. For that reason, recent issues focus on the guarantee of both scalability and quality at once for MIR by content-based audio identification technique in a large database. 
Lately, content-based MIR has been worthy of notice as one of the state-of-the-art and attractive application services on the music portal market in wire/wireless communication. For example, many companies offer the application service to provide the information of a song greeted from a loudspeaker in any place, to monitor the broadcasting music, to prevent from sharing the unauthorized music files through peer-to-peer network, or to send a message when the song is being on the air [5][6]. The audio fingerprinting scheme of Philips, one of recent content-based audio identification techniques, is definitely pertinent to that purpose [7][8]. In real-environment, it still remains problems even so such as channel-effects, background noise, speed-change, arrangement, etc. Especially, the problem of channel effects should be firstly solved in sound recording condition just as speech recognition system [10][11]. Generally, an audio signal is easily distorted by channel-effects when it is recorded through a microphone. The recording audio signals may be distorted by the adverse effects of electrical devices such as microphones, sound devices, loudspeakers, etc. Figure 1 illustrates how distinct the spectrograms can be between the original and the recorded signal, where the left and right bottom spectrograms are recorded over a 2.1-channel and a poor quality laptop loudspeaker, respectively. A false of audio identification is mainly caused by the mismatch the channel-normalization techniques as temporal filtering may be effective and useful to overcome this problem. The next section describes a basic concept of the audio fingerprinting scheme of Philips and discusses the alternatives to temporal filtering to reduce the channel-for audio identification in real-environment. 2.1 The Audio Fingerprinting Scheme of Philips The Philips fingerprinting scheme is based on a sign of differential sub-band energy of the perceptual audio spectrum. Overview of the audio fingerprint extraction scheme of Philips is depicted in Figure 2. Mel or bark scale filter-bank is commonly used to reflect perceptual characteristics of an audio signal. Sub-fingerprint for every frame is based on the sign of differentiated power spectrum simultaneously along the time and frequency axes. The derivatives of spectral parameters along frequency and time axes are to be a high-pass filtering. It may be possible to remove slowly varying components as the undesired perturbations. Also it is uncorrelated with its temporal and frequency neighbors. Generally, it is very robust to many kinds of audio processing [7][8]. Here, a sub-fingerprint is being a typically 32-bit code from perceptually divided 33 frequency bands. Also, it is directly being an addressing point for database lookup. The 32-bit sequence is usually referred to the hash value. As stated above, a sub-fingerprint can be hashing by a 32-bit code for every frame. The bit is assigned as where ) , ( m n E is the energy of n th frame and m th band [7][8]. 
This scheme can be very efficient for the database lookup since the hash value is highly unique and robust. For the fast database lookup, it checks only hash positions with the pre-determined Hamming distance. In other words, it is blockaded to match Hamming distance among hash values. That is, the best matched result is determined by the BER (Bit Error Rate) per the fingerprint block. 2.2 The Alternatives to Temporal Filtering Temporal filtering of the FBEs (Filter-Bank Energies) is to remove its D.C. and slowly varying components as the undesired perturbations by linear distortion [9]-[12]. As mentioned above, the audio fingerprints would be much more robust to linear distortion if FBEs were uncorrelated with its temporal neighbors. Temporal filtering [9]-[12]. The typical temporal filtering techniques are defined as 
H is high-pass type of a first-order FIR filter, general case of 2 T H . 3 T H when 2 = K is used in this work. audio fingerprints which are robust to channel-distortion regarding to real-situation. The high-pass filtering may be expected to suppress the effects of the convolutional noise by the channel, and the low-pass filtering may be expected to smooth out some of the fast spectral change. For that reason, the band-pass filter may be more relevant to temporal filtering in this work. Specially, the RASTA filter would be the best due to the filter slope or shape [11][12]. 3.1 Audio Data For experiments regarding to real environment, an audio query clip was captured by using an inexpensive microphone such as a general pin or stand microphone which was apart from a 2.1 channel loudspeaker of mp3 player at a distance of 10 ~ 20 cm. The audio query has the 7~8 seconds X  duration and is converted to standard PCM format which is sampled at 11.025 kHz and quantized with 16 bits in mono channel. Music items for references consist of 5,000 popular songs which have mp3 format (192 Kbps, 44.1 kHz, stereo) converted from audio CDs. The audio data are down sampled to 11.025 kHz for considering portable devices such as an mp3 player, a PDA, or a mobile phone. They include various genres such as rock/ballad, pop/dance, rap, folk, and so on. Audio query data were captured from the randomly selected 50 songs per each query set. And each song was played at randomly setting offset time several hundred times. 
To evaluate the proposed techniques, the query data consist of 5 types of set according to the device and the recording environments. Only the query signal of Set IV has the 7 seconds X  duration and the others have the 8 seconds X  duration. To say nothing of, all microphones are omni-directional. Also, all cases of the distance between microphone and loudspeaker are apart around 10 ~ 20 cm, and the distance between microphone and noise source is around 2 ~ 5 meters. 
In signal processing step, the audio frame was parameterized into 0.37 seconds rate and shifted at 11.6 ms rate to extract hash value. Considering human auditory system, the selected frequency bands lie in the range from 300 Hz to 3,000 Hz. This interval is the relevant spectral range at a sampling rate of 11.025 kHz. 3.2 Performance Evaluation perfect when there is signal distortion by channel or noise. To improve this defect, the candidate positions for the database lookup expand into hash values with a Hamming checking all hash candidates by setting the threshold for breaking the database lookup. Empirically, it took only 3~4 times more lookup time when we set the threshold to 0.29 of the BER per the fingerprint block. 
As shown in Table 1, in the case of that the lookup candidates are expanded or not, the band-pass filters are generally superior to the high-pass filter type used in Philips. As was expected, the RASTA filter has the best results in this work. Especially, it is RASTA filter normalizes the channel-effects to be sure. From the experiments, we observed that the alternatives to temporal filtering are expected, the RASTA filter as a channel-normalization technique is much superior to the other temporal filtering techniques. In this work, even if we had no regard for out-acceptance or rejection. Empirically, there is no false acceptance when the threshold is set to 0.41 of BER. But a false rejection is added to the above results. In case of Set V, the additional false rejection rate is below 0.63 % when the checking positions are expanded. Since there is a trade-off relation between a false rejection and a false acceptance, it should be adjusted as the case may be. 
For the further study, we will consider not only the alternative to temporal filtering but also the alternative to frequency filtering which is robust to real-noise for commercial service. Also, we will seek for the best combined filter with frequency and temporal filter to have the better synergy effect.
