 The rapid and perpetual growth of knowledge on the Web has given rise to many grand challenges (such as scalabil-ity, inconsistency, uncertainty, distribution and dynamics) for traditional knowledge processing methods and systems. Knowledge representation, retrieval and reasoning methods need to evolve and adapt to the Web to face these challenges and make this vast, heterogenous knowledge useful and ac-cessible. In this light, the International Workshop on Web-scale Knowledge Representation, Retrieval, and Reasoning (Web-KR) is initiated. This workshop serves as the third one in this workshop series. This summary discusses the scope of Web-KR and introduces the advances in this field through the accepted papers in the Web-KR 2012 workshop, co-located with CIKM 2012.

The World Wide Web has become the carrier for the largest human knowledge repository in history. As its knowl-edge bases are growing towards a practically  X  X nfinite X  vol-ume, Web-scale Knowledge Representation, Retrieval, and Reasoning (Web-KR) is becoming a real issue and an ur-gent task. Although the Web community has developed a number of knowledge representation languages and rea-soning methods, when the volume, goes Web-scale, existing approaches meet many challenging problems, such as scal-Ma ny of the accepted papers in previous two years have in-vestigated in these topics in depth from various perspectives. The following three papers deal with Web-scale reasoning and query processing: In the 2010 workshop in Toronto,  X  X DFS Backward Chained Reasoning Support in 4store X  X as introduced as early attempt for parallel backward chained reasoning for semantic Web data [9]. In the 2011 workshop in Lyon, TripleCloud was introduced as a cloud based Web-scale query engine which benefits from existing cloud based key-value stores (e.g.BigTable, HBase) and scales to billion triples for complex queries [3]. While in [7], the authors in-troduced an ant behavior inspired algorithm that deals with Web-scale range queries (e.g. queries on data annotated with location and time) [7].

From the perspective of Web-scale knowledge acquisition and representation, and in particular large scale categorized Wikipedia contents, [5] introduced an approach for mining fuzzy domain ontologies based on concept vectors. From the application perspective, efficient representation methods for dynamic Web pages have also been investigated [2]. In addition, effective visualization techniques have been applied to support browsing online Multimedia Digital Library [6]. Nevertheless, there are still several topics related to Web-KR remained to be explored.
We are very pleased to find that the scope and interesting topics for Web-KR has been extended by the submissions in the 2012 version of this workshop.
 For more general purpose knowledge processing on the Web, OmpiJava is proposed and implemented as a reaction to grand challenges for data-centric supercomputing on the Web [1]. The author introduces the Message Passing Inter-face (MPI) bindings to Java, seamlessly integrated in Open MPI. Based on the author X  X  contribution, the implementa-tion  X  X nables Java based Semantic Web applications to be successfully ported to the most of modern HPC systems X  X 1]. A parallel version of random indexing is implemented as an illustrative example to validate OmpiJava.

In order to provide a human centered approach for Web-scale knowledge organization and retrieval, in [8], the au-thors propose to apply semiotic (i.e., sub-syntactical) and inductive (i.e., probabilistic) methods for inferring concept associations. Fuzzy semantic networks are used to represent knowledge on the Web. In addition, the authors provide in-teractive visualization tools to visualize these cognitive con-cept maps, and an exploratory search paradigm is taken for browsing and searching the organized semantic network [8].
In contrast with the deductive approaches for Web-scale reasoning introduced in this workshop series during these three years, in [4], the authors take a data mining approach for finding useful knowledge. More specifically, this paper formally proposes and defines the task of mining frequent correlated sequential patterns from a sequential database. The PSBSpan algorithm is proposed based on pattern-growth methodology. The validation through finding popular tourism trails based on Flickr data shows the effectiveness of the pro-posed algorithm on processing Web entities with sequential characteristics. We see approaches that combine large scale deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning on the Web as a very promising direction for Web-KR.
