 EDITORIAL Kathrin Berkner  X  Laurence Likforman-Sulem This special issue brings together papers presented at the 16th Document Recognition and Retrieval Conference (DRR) held in January 2009 in San Jose, CA, as part of the IS&amp;T/ SPIE Electronic Imaging Symposium. The DRR confer-ence aims at presenting approaches which may improve the extraction of information from various types of docu-ments: scanned, web-based, online or camera-based docu-ments. These approaches may concern the early stages of information extraction such as image enhancement, binari-zation, or document structure extraction. They may also con-cern higher stages of information extraction such as OCR, handwriting recognition, or symbol recognition. When these stages are achieved or when an electronic version is already available, information extraction and retrieval techniques can be applied. Related studies include document or writer/sig-nature authentication.

This special issue combines seven papers that discuss the different problems encountered in document recognition and retrieval, ranging from geometric distortion detection to handwriting recognition and writer identification.
The work by van Beusekom, Shafait and Breuel deals with problems arising when a large number of images are scanned (fax images or images received in advanced mailrooms) with avarietyof scanorientations. Theproposedmethoddetects in acombinedschemewhetherascannedpagehasbeenscanned in the correct orientation and the skew angle.

The paper by Peng et al. introduces a document recogni-tion system for Mongolian documents addressing the specific needs of the vertical cursive writing style and multiple font variations of the Mongolian script.

In order to obtain an efficient solution to creation and maintenance of large bibliographic databases, a technology for locating and parsing bibliographic references in HTML medical articles is described by Zou, Le and Thoma. In a two-step process using statistical machine learning algo-rithms, the references are first located and then parsed.
The remaining three papers address research questions related to handwriting recognition.

Recognition of handwritten Japanese text is the topic of the paper by Zhu et al. The proposed solution integrates the segmentation and recognition steps using string class proba-bility approximation.

Golubitsky and Watt study the problem of online clas-sification of isolated handwritten symbols using distance measures on spaces of curves. Accuracy and computational complexity of various distance measures are compared and the one most suitable for the purpose of recognition of hand-written mathematical symbols on mobile devices selected.
Tan, Viard-Gaudin and Kot apply allograph prototypes to online writer identification, an application gaining much interest in areas such as forensics, biometric security systems and writing on smart whiteboards. In their approach, char-acter prototypes that are used as allographs produce a con-sistent set of templates that models the handwriting styles of writers.

Text categorization of online handwritten documents is analyzed by Pe X a Saldarriaga et al. Textual content is uti-lized by analyzing the effect of word recognition errors on the classification performance.

In a time where documents live on paper and as elec-tronic versions in an internet-connected world with e-readers and tablets entering the market enabling handwritten input to digitized documents, document recognition and analysis research is looking into an exciting future. The guest editors would like to thank all the authors that have submitted papers to this special issue and all the reviewers for their contribution that allowed us to compose an exciting collection of papers. We would also like to thank the Editors-in-Chief Profs. D. Doermann and K. Tombre, the Editorial Board, and Ms. G. Balasubramanian for making it possible to organize this special issue.
