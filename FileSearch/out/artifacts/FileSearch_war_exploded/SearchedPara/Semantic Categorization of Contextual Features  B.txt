 Currently, TTS technologies for natural ness have improved dramatically and have been applied to many unlimited domain systems. However, improvement in the accu-racy of TTS products has been relatively static. According to the accuracy test results of 19 TTS products by Voice Information Associates, the weakest area of the TTS products is in number processing of which average accuracy is 55.6% among the ambiguity-generating areas [7]. In the modern Korean language, numerals have three different origins X  X orean, Chinese and Englis h X  X nd they show a variety of variants. Their distribution largely depends on context. For example, a single numeral '3' can morpheme (Ex 1-a~e). ball  X   X  In (Ex 1), classifiers following Arabic numerals play an important role for determin-ing the reading of Arabic numerals. However, a homograph classifier following an Arabic numeral, multiple readings are acceptable for an Arabic numeral as shown in (Ex 1-f). Thus, contextual features or patterns are required to resolve the ambiguity in reading of Arabic numerals, and to be l earned in order to cover new data. 
The other parts of this paper are as follows. In Section 2, related work on WSD is studied. In Section 3, one approach to WSD by learning the semantic categories of contextual features extracted from corpora is suggested. Categorization of the seman-tic classes based on the lexical relations in KorLex1.0 is illustrated. Experimentations are performed in this section. Conclusions and future work of this paper are followed. Because of the strong dependencies of contextual features, a decision tree algorithm has been adopted, which is an efficient classifier for handling complex conditional dependencies and non-dependencies [2, 5]. Efficiency deteriorates when the classifier handles very large parameter spaces, such as the highly lexicalized feature sets. Thus, work on grouping similar individual words as semantic categories was studied based on established semantic categories contained in Roget X  X  thesaurus [8]. The method achieves high accuracy in disambiguating word sense when thesaurus categories and senses align well with topics. Twenty-four semantic categories in WordNet1.5 3 have been applied for WSD, in the respect of sense granularity, semantic categories in WordNet are finer than that of Roget thesaurus [1]. Ambiguities in reading Arabic numerals can be resolved using context as shown in (Ex 1-a~e). Homographic classifiers, however, cause ambiguities and need additional contextual features as to determine the reading of an Arabic numeral combined with the classifier. For the purpose of analyzing the ambiguities caused by homographic data were randomly sampled from news articles issued for two years (January 1st, 2000 to December 31st, 2001) from 10 major newspapers in Korea. The size of cor-pora is 15,196 eo-jeol 4 s. All instances of Arabic numerals combined with homo-graphic classifiers are collected and then the correct RFA tags are labeled 5 . 3.1 Ambiguities Caused by Homographic Classifiers Since many Chinese homographic classifiers are combined with Arabic numerals, precedent analysis on the senses of the classifiers is required for selecting the correct Reading Formulae of Arabic numerals (RFA). [Table 1] shows each sense of homo-graphic classifiers and the RFA as an example. 
Other homographic classifiers such as  X  gi1 (unit of rockets, tombs), gi2 (unit of a stage, a session) X ,  X  dae1 (unit of auto-mobiles, machines or bicycles), dae2 (the big-gest item), dae3 (the time of life or persons in the time of life) X ,  X  dan1 (unit of bun-su2 (a piece of poems), su3 (sou) X ,  X  guan1 (Korean measurement of weight), guan2 (unit of halls) X ,  X  jib1 (a series), jib2 (a house) X  have been analyzed. 3.2 Homographic Sense Disambiguation Based on Corpus and KorLex Since RFA is determined depending on the sense of homographic classifiers and the ambiguities of homographs are resolved by the semantic correlation with neighboring words in turn, words around the Arabic numerals and homographic classifiers can be used as distinctive features to predict the correct RFA. The steps of the extraction of contextual features will be outlined, using a homographic classifier  X  gu  X  in [Table 1], as an example. Step 1: Morphological Analysis In Korean, content words and function morphemes such as case markers, postposi-tions, or endings come in one eo-jeol . Content words are separated from function morphemes and be lemmatized through morphological analysis.
 Step 2: Contextual Feature Extraction and Semantic Categorization Among the lemmatized content words, nouns are extracted as shown in [Table 2]. 
Words proceeding (-3, -2, -1) or following (+1, +2, +3) the combination of Arabic numerals and homographic classifiers are clustered into semantic categories based on lexical hierarchy in KorLex 1.0 [3]. The process for semantic cat egorizing contextual features is described as follows: Step 2-1 : Mapping lemmatized words used as contextual features-extracted from the tagged corpus-to KorLex hierarchy. For example, words { cheinji-eob (change-up) , bol (ball) , jiggu (fastball), samjin (putout)} used as contextua l features for disambigu-ating  X  gu 3 ( X  X itch X ) X  are mapped to the hierarchy in KorLex. Step 2-2 : Listing all common hypernyms of synset nodes mapped from contextual features. Common hypernyms are { haengwi (act)} as shown in [Figure 1]. Step 2-3 : Finding the Least Upper Bound (LUB) of synset nodes mapped from con-textual features. Here, { haengwi } is selected as LUB. selected { haengwi } becomes the generalized semantic category of { cheinji-eob, bol, jiggu , samjin }. Following the same procedure, { sache (dead_body)} has been re-assigned for the semantic category of { sache (dead_body), siche (corpse)}, which are contextual features for disambiguating  X  gu 1(unit of dead body) X  and { haengjeong_gu-yeog (administrative_district)} for { gangnam-gu (Gangnam-gu) , songpa-gu (Songpa-gu), seocho-gu (Seocho-gu), seongeogu (election_district)}, which are contextual features for  X  gu 2 (borough) X , respectively. By application of the procedure to the training corpus, 54 semantic categories have been obtained. Step 3: Extraction of Pattern and Arithmetic Features The other learning features are combined patterns of Arabic numerals and text sym-bols, arithmetic features and the individual homographic classifiers as in [Table 3]. 
Input ANEs are converted to patterns, for example,  X 3 X  is converted to  X  X  X , and  X  X A1, NT0 X  are obtained for its pattern features. Once the pattern features are ob-tained, the corresponding arithmetic features such as the size of Arabic numerals or the 1 st place of Arabic numerals are extracted to distinguish same token having differ-ent meanings .
 Step 4: Training Learning Features and Testing Performance Since semantic categories of contextual features affect each other and arithmetic fea-tures largely depend on patterns, a decisi on tree has been adopted as the learning algorithm [6]. The performance of the model is tested using a 10-cross validation checking method. Baseline accuracy has been measured by adopting one rule-if the number of groups in the target ANEs is  X  X A1 X , then RFA is  X  X ca_b[+D] X , which is the most frequent class (MFC). The result is shown in [Table 4]. 
The proposed model shows 87.3% accuracy, which is 14.1% higher than that of the baseline determined by MFC. Though the result is good, two problems still remain to be resolved: 
First, contextual features which are homographs or polysemies cause their own ambiguities. For example, a homograph { gageog } can be mapped to { gageog (shot)} and { gageog (monetary_value)}. In addition, there are many synsets having multipar-single semantic category in KorLex. For resolving this problem, scoring algorithm to select the correct sense of gageog among other senses should be considered. Second, since KorLex 1.0 based on WordNet2.0 has not been refined completely, numerous Korean words or concepts which do not exist in WordNet are missing in KorLex1.0. In this paper, the ambiguities of Arabic Numerals combined with ambiguous classifi-ers are analyzed and the resolutions for thei r sense disambiguation based on KorLex 1.0 are proposed. Nouns proceeding or following the ANEs are categorized into 54 semantic classes based on the lexical hierarchy in KorLex1.0. The semantic categories of contextual features are trained to deci de the meaning and the reading of ANEs using C4.5 algorithm. The experimentation results show that the proposed model is efficient and accurate. For the future work, WSD for ambiguous contextual features by adopting scoring algorithm should be continued. Since KorLex1.0 has not been refined completely yet, continuous studies on WSD for other applications with the refined KorLex are promising.
