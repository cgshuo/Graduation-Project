 The Netflix experience is driven by a number of recommen-dation algorithms: personalized ranking, page generation, similarity, ratings, search, etc. On the January 6th, 2016 we simultaneously launched Netflix in 130 new countries around the world, which brought the total to over 190 countries. Preparing for such a rapid expansion while ensuring each algorithm was ready to work seamlessly created new chal-lenges for our recommendation and search teams. In this talk, we will highlight the four most interesting challenges we encountered in making our algorithms operate globally and how this improved our ability to connect members world-wide with stories they X  X l love.

In particular, we will dive into the problems of uneven availability across catalogs, balancing personal and cultural tastes, handling language, and tracking quality of recom-mendations. Uneven catalog availability is a challenge be-cause many recommendation algorithms assume that people could interact with any item and then use the absence of in-teraction implicitly or explicitly as negative information in the model. However, this assumption does not hold globally and across time where item availability differs. Running al-gorithms globally means needing a notion of location so that we can handle local variations in taste while also providing a good basis for personalization. Language is another chal-lenge in recommending video content because people can typically only enjoy content that has assets (audio, subti-tles) in languages they understand. The preferences for how people enjoy such content also vary between people and de-pend on their familiarity with a language. Also, while would like our recommendations to work well for every one of our members, tracking quality becomes difficult because with so many members in so many countries speaking so many lan-guages, it can be hard to determine when an algorithm or system is performing sub-optimally for some subset of them. Thus, to support this global launch, we examined each and every algorithm that is part of our service and began to address these challenges.
