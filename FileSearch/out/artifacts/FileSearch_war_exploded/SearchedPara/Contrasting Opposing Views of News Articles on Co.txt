 {spark,jun e song} @ nclab.kaist.ac.kr selfsolee @ chonbuk.ac.kr The coverage of contentious issues of a community is an essential function of journalism. Conte n tious issues continuously arise in various domains, such as politics, economy, environment; each issue i n-volves diverse participants and their different co m-plex arguments. However, news articles are frequently biased and fail to fairly deliver conflic t-ing arguments of the issue. I t is difficult for ord i-nary readers to analyze the conflicting arguments and understand the contention ; t hey mostly pe r-ceive the issue passively, often through a single article . Advanc ed n ew s delivery models are r e-quired to increase awareness on conflicting views.
In this paper, we present disputant relation -based method for classifying news articles o n co n-tentious issues. We o b serve that the disputants of a contention, i.e., people who take a position and participate in the contention such as politicians, companies, stak e holders, civic groups, experts, commentators, etc ., are an important feature for understanding the discourse. News producers pr i-marily shape an article o n a co n tention by selecting and covering specific disputants (Baker. 1994) . Readers also intuitively understand the contention by identifying who the opposing disp u tants are.
The method helps readers intuitively view the news articles through the opponent -based frame . I t pe r forms classification in an unsupervised manner: it dynamically identifies opposing disputant groups and classifies the articles according to their pos i-tions. As such, it effectively helps readers co n trast articles of a contention and attain balanced u nde r-stand ing , free from specific biased vie w points.
The proposed method differs from th ose used in related tasks as it aims to perform classification under the opponent -based frame. Research on se n-timent classification and debate stance recognition takes a topic -oriented view, and attempts to pe r-form classification under the  X  positive vs. neg a tive  X  or  X  for vs. against  X  frame for the given topic, e.g., positive vs. negative about iPhone. 
However , such frames are often not appropriat e for classifying n ews a r t i cles of a co n te n tion . The cove r age of a co n te n tion often spans over di f ferent to p ics (Mi l ler. 2001). F or the co n te n tion on the health care bill, an art i cle may di s cuss the e n larged co v erage whereas anot h er may discuss the i n crease of i n surance pr e miums. In a d dition, we ob serve that opposing a r guments of a co n te n tion are often co m plex to cla s sify u n der th e se frames. For e x a m-ple, in a p o litical co n tention on holding a re f ere n-dum on the Sejong project 1 , the oppos i tion parties strongly opposed and crit i cized the pres i dent offi ce . Mea n while, t he pres i dent o f fice a r gued that they were not consi d e r ing holding the refere n dum and the co n tention arose from a mi s unde r standing . I n such a case, it is diff i cult to classify any argument to the  X  X os i tive X  ca t e gory of the frame.

We demonst rate that the opponent -based frame is clear and effective for contrasting opposing views of contentious issues. For the contention on the referendum,  X  president office vs. opposition pa r ties  X  provides an intuitive frame to understand the contention . The fram e does not require the doc u ments to discuss common topics nor the o p-po s ing arguments to be positive vs. neg a tive. 
Under the proposed frame, it becomes important to analyze which side is more centrally covered in an article . U nlike debate posts or product reviews news articles , in general, do not take a position explicitly (e x cept a few type s such as editorials ). They instead quote a specific side, elaborate them, and provide supportive facts. On the other hand, the opposing disputants compete fo r news cove r-age to influence more readers and gain support (Miller et al. 2001). Thus, t he method f o cuses on identify ing the disputants of each side and classif y-ing the articles based on the side it c o vers.
We applied a modified version of HITS alg o-rithm to identify the key opponents of an issue, and use d disputant extraction techniques combined with an SVM classifier for article analysis . We observe that the method achieves acceptable pe r-formance for practical use with basic language r e-sources and tools, i.e., Named Entity Recognizer (Lee et al. 2006 ) , POS tagger ( Shim et al. 2002) , and a translated pos i tive/negative lexicon . As we deal with non -English (Korean) news art i cles , it is difficult to obtain rich resources and tools, e.g., WordNet, dependency p arser, annotated corpus such as MPQA. When applied to English, we b e-lieve t he method could be further improved by adopting them. Research has been made on sentiment classific a-tion in document -level (Turney et al., 2002, Pang et al., 2002, Seki et al. 2008, Ounis et al. 2006 ) . It aims to automatically identify and classify the se n-timent of documents into positive or negative . Opinion summarization aims a similar goal, to identify different opinions on a topic and generate summari es of them. Paul et al. (2010) developed an unsupervised met h od for generating summar ies of contrastive opinions on a common topic. Th e se works make a number of assumptions that are di f-ficult to apply to the discourse of contentious news i s sues . They assume that the input documents have a common opinion target , e.g., a movie. Many of them primarily deal with documents which expli c-itly reveal opinions on the selected target , e.g., movie reviews. They usually apply one static cla s-sification frame, positive vs. neg a tive, to the topic. 
The discourse of contentious issues in news art i-cles show different characteristics from that stu d-ied in the sentiment classification tasks. First, t he opponents of a contentious issue often discuss di f-ferent topics , as discussed in the example above . Research in mass communication has showed that opposing disputants talk across each other , not by dialogue, i.e., they martial different facts and inte r-pretations rather than to give different answers to the same to p ics (Schon et al., 1994).

Second, t he frame of argument is not fixed as  X  positive vs. negative  X  . We frequently observed both sides of a contention articulating negative a r-guments attacking each other. The forms of arg u-ments are also complex and diverse to classify them as p ositive or negative ; f or example, an a r-gument may just n e glect the opponent  X  s argument without positive or negative expressions , or e m-phasize a different discu s sion point. 
In addition, a position of a contention can be communicated without explicit expres sion of opi n-ion or sentiment. It is often conveyed through o b-jective sentences that include carefully selected facts. For example, a news article can cast a neg a-tive light on a government program simply by co v-ering the i n crease of deficit caused by it.

A n umber of works deal with debate stance recognition , which is a closely related task . They a t temp t to identify a position of a debate, such as i deological ( Somasundaran et al., 2010, Lin et al., 2006) or product comparison debate ( S o-masundaran et al., 2 009) . They assume a debate frame , which is similar to the frame of the sent i-ment classification task, i.e., for vs. against the d e-bate topic. All articles of a d e bate in their corpus cover a coherent debate topic, e.g., i Phone vs. B lackberry, and explicitl y express opinions for or against to the topic, e.g., for or against iPhone or B lackbe r ry . The proposed methods assume that the debate frame is known apriori. This debate frame is often not appr o priate for contentious issues for similar reasons as the posi tive/negative frame. In contrast , our method does not assume a fixed d e-bate frame, and rather devel ops one based on the opponents of the co n tention at hand .

The news corpus is also different from the d e-bate corpus . N ews articles of a co n tentious issue are more diverse than debate articles co n veying explicit argument of a specific side . There are news articles which cover both sides, facts without explicit opinion s , and different topics un related to the a r guments of either side. 
Several works have used the relation between speakers or authors for classifying their debate stance ( Thomas et al., 2006, Agrawal et al., 2003) . However, these works also assume the same debate frame and use the debate corpus , e.g., floor debates in the House of Representatives, onl ine debate f o-rums . T heir approaches are also supervised , and require training data for relation analysis, e.g., vo t-ing records of co n gresspeople. Establishing an appropriate argument frame is i m-portant. It provides a framework w hich enable readers to intuitively understand the contention. It also determines how classification method s should classify art i cles of the issue.

We conduct ed a user study to compare the o p-ponent -based frame and the positive (for) vs. neg a-tive (against) f rame. In the experiment, multiple human annotators classified the same set of news articles under each of the two frames. We co m-pared which frame is clearer for the classific a tion, and more effective for expo s ing opposing views. We selected 14 contentious issues from Naver News (a popular news portal in Korea) issue a r-chive. We randomly sampled about 20 articles per each issue, for a total of 250 articles. The selected issues range over diverse domains such as politics, l o cal, diplomacy, economy ; to name a few for e x-a m ple, the conte n tion on the 4 river project, of which the key opponents are the government vs. catholic church; the entrance of big retailers to the supe r market business, of which the key opponents are the small store owners vs. big retail companies; th e refusal to approve an integrated civil servants  X  u n ion , of which the key opp o nents are government vs. Korean g overnment e mployees  X  u nion . 
We use an internationally known co n tention, i.e., the di s pute about the Cheonan sin k ing incident , as an e x ample to g ive more details on the disputants. Our data set includes 25 articles that were pu b-lished after the South Korea  X  s announcement of their i n vestigation result. Many disputants appear in the articles, e.g., South Korean Government, South Korea defense secreta ry, North Korean Gover n ment, United States officials, Chinese e x-perts, p o litical pa r ties of South Korea, etc. Three annotators performed the classification . All of them were students. For impartiality, two of them were recruited from outside the team, who were not aware of this research. 
The annotators performed two subtasks for cla s-sification. As for the positive vs. negative frame, first , we asked them to designate the main topic of the contention. Second , they classified the articles which mainly deliv er arguments for the topic to the  X  X os i tive X  category and those delivering arguments against the topic to the  X  negative  X  ca tegory. The art i cles are classified to the  X  Other  X  category if they do not deal with the main topic nor cover po s-itive or negative ar g u ment s . 
As for the opponent -based frame, first , we asked them to designate the competing opponent s. S e-cond, w e asked to classify articles to a specific side if the articles cover only the positions, arguments, or info r mation supportive of that side or if they cover information detrimental or crit i cism to its opposite side. Other articles were classified to the  X  Other  X  category. Examples of this category i n-clude articles covering both sides fairly, descri b ing general background or implications of the issue .
The agreement in classification was higher for the opponent -based frame in most issues. This i n-dicates that the annotators could apply the frame more clearly, resulting in smaller difference b e-tween them. The kapp a measure was 0.7 8 on ave r-age. The kappa measure near 0.8 indicates a su b-stantial level of agre e ment, and the value can be achieved, for example, when 8 or 9 out of 10 items are annotated equally (T a ble 1) .

In addition, fewer articles were classified to th e  X  Other  X  category under the opponent -based frame. T he annotators classified about half of the articles to this category under the positive vs. negative frame whereas they classified about 35% to the category under the opponent -based frame . This is because the frame is more flexible to classify d i-verse articles of an issue, such as those covering arguments on diffe r ent points , and those covering detrimental facts to a specific side without explicit positive or negative a r guments.

The kappa measure was less than 0.5 for near half of the issues under the positive -negative frame. The agreement was low especially when the main topic of the contention was interpreted differently among the annotators ; the main topic was inte r-preted differently for issue 3, 7, 8, a nd 9. Even when the topic was interpreted identically, the a n-notators were confused in judg ing complex arg u-ments either as positive or negative. One annotator commented that  X  it was confusing as the arg u-ments were not clearly for or against the topic o f-ten . Even when a disputant was assumed to have a positive attitude towards the topic , the disputant X  X  main argument was not about the topic but about attacking the o p ponent  X  The annotators all agreed that the opponent -based frame is more effective to understa nd the conte n tion . D isputant relation -based method adopts the opp o-nent -based frame for classification . It attempts to identify the two opposing groups of the issue at hand, and an a lyze s whether an article more reflects t he position of a specific side. The method is based on the observation that there exists two opposing group s of disputants , and the groups compete for news co v erage. They strive to influence readers  X  interpretation, evaluation of the issue and gain support from them ( Miller et al. 2001 ) . In this competing process, news article s may give more chance of speaking to a specific si de, explain or elaborate them, or provide su p portive facts of that side ( Baker 1994 ) .

The proposed method is performed in three stag es : t he first stage, disputant extraction, extracts the disputants appearing in an article set; the s e-cond stage, disputant partition, partitions the e x-tracted disputants into two opposing groups; lastly, the news classification stage classifies the articl es into three categories, i.e., two for the articles b i-ased to each group, and one for the others. 4.1 Disputant Extraction In this stage, the disputants who participate in the contention have to be extracted. We utilize that many disputants appear as the su b j ect of quotes in the news article set. The articles actively quote or cover their action in order to deliver the contention lively. We used straight forward methods for e x-traction of su b jects. The method s were effective in practice as quotes of articles fr equently had a reg u-lar pa t tern.

T he subjects of direct and indirect quotes are e x-tracted . The sentences including an utterance i n-side double quotes are considered as direct quotes. out double quotes, and those d escribing the action of a disputant are considered as indirect quotes (See the translated example 1 b e low) . The indirect quotes are identified based on the morphology of the en d ing word. The ending word of the indirect quotes frequently has a verb as its r oot or includes a verbalization suffix . Other sentences, typ i cally, those describing the reporter X  X  interpretation or comments are not considered as quotes . (See e x-ample sentence 2. T he ending word of the original sentence is written in bol d face). (1) T he gove rnment clarified that there won X  X  be (2) T he government  X  X  belief is that a stern r e-
A named entity combined with a topic particle or a subject particle i s identified as the subject of these quotes . We detect the name of an organiz a-tion, person, or country using the Korean Named Entity Recognizer (Lee et al. 2006) . A simple anaphora resolution is conducted to identify su b-jects also from abbreviated referenc es or pr o nouns in subsequent quotes. 4.2 Disputant Partitioning We develop key opponent -based partitioning method for disputant partitioning. The method first ident i fies two key opponents, each representing one side, and uses them as a pivot for partitionin g other disp u tants. T he other disputants are divided according to their relation with the key o p ponents, i.e., which key opponent they stand for or against.
The intuition behind the method is that there usually exists key opponents who represent the conten tion, and many participants argue about the key opponents whereas they seldom recognize and talk about m i nor disputants. For instance, in the contention on  X  X nvestigation result of the Cheonan sinking incident X , the government of North Korea and that of So uth Korea are the key opponents; other disputants, such as politicians, experts, civic group of South Korea, the government of U.S. , and that of China, mostly speak about the key opp o-nents. Thus, it is effective to analyze where the disputants stand r e gard ing their att i tude toward the key opponents.

Selecting key opponents: In order to identify the key opponents of the issue, we search for the disp u tants who frequently criticize, and are also criticized by other disputants. As the key opp o-nents get more new s coverage, they have more chance to articulate their argument, and also have more chance to face counter -arguments by other disputants.

This is done in two steps. First, for each disp u-tant, we analyze whom he or she criticizes and by whom he or she is cri ticized. The method goes through each sentence of the article set and searc h-es for both di s putant X  X  criticisms and the criticisms about the disputant. Based on the criticisms, it an a-lyzes relationships among disputants.

A sentence is considered to express the disp u-tant X  X  criticism to another disputant if the follo w-ing holds: 1) the sentence is a quote, 2) the disputant is the subject of the quote, 3) another disputant appears in the quote, and 4) a negative lexicon appears in the sentence. 
On the other han d, if the disputant is not the su b-ject but appears in the quote, the sentence is co n-sidered to express a criticism about the disputant made by another disputant (See example 3. The disputants are written in italic, and negative words are in boldface.). (3) th e government defined that  X  X he attack of 
The negative lexicon we use is carefully built from the Wilson lexicon (Wilson et al. 2005). We translated all the terms in it u sing the Google tran s-lation, and manually inspected the translated result to filter out inappropriate translations and the terms that are not negative in the Korean context.

Second, we apply an adapted version of HITS graph algorithm to find major disputan ts. For this, the criticizing relationships obtained in the first step are represented in a graph. Each disputant is modeled as a node, and a link is made from a crit i-cizing disputant to a criticized disputant. 
Originally, the HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) is designed to rate Web pages regarding the link structure. The feature of the algorithm is that it separately models the value of outlinks and in links. Each node, i.e., a web page, has two scores: the auth ority score, which reflects the value of inlinks toward itself , and the hub score, which reflects the value of its outlinks to others . The hub score of a node increases if it links to nodes with high autho r-ity score, and the authority score increases if it is pointed by many nodes with high hub score.

We adopt the HITS algorithm due to above fe a-ture . It enables us to separately measure the signi f-icance of a disputant X  X  criticism (using the hub score) and the criticism about the disputant (using the authorit y score). We aim to find the nodes which have both high hub score and high authority score; the key opp o nents will have many links to others and also be pointed by many nodes. 
The modified HITS algorithm is shown in Fi g-ure 2. We make some adaptation to ma ke the alg o-rithm reflect the disputants X  characteristics. The initial hub score of a node is set to the number of quotes in which the corresponding disputant is the subject. The initial authority score is set to the number of quotes in which the disputant appears but not as the subject. In addition, the weight of each link (from a criticizing disputant to a crit i-cized disputant) is set to the number of sentences that express such criticism . 
We select the nodes which show relatively high hub score and high authority score compared to other nodes. We rank the nodes according to the sum of hub and authority scores, and select from the top ran k ing node. The node is not selected if its hub or authority score is zero. The selection is fi n-ished if more than two no des are selected and the sum of hub and authority scores is less than half of the sum of the previously selected node. 
More than two disputants can be selected if more than one disputant is active from a specific side. In such cases, we choose the two disputants whose criticizing relationship is the strongest among the selec t ed ones , i.e., the two who show the highest ratio of criticism b e tween them.

Partitioning minor disputants: Given the two key opponents, we partition the rest of disputants based on their relations with the key opponents. For th is , we identify whether each disputant has positive or negative relations with the key opp o-nents. The disputant is classified to the side of the key opponent who shows more positive relations. If the disputant shows more negative relations, the disputant is classified to the o p posite side. 
We analyze the relationship not only from the article set but also from the web news search r e-sults. The minor disputants may not be covered importantly in the article set; hence, it can be diff i-cult to obtain su f ficient data for analysis. The web news search results provide supplementary data for the analysis of rel a tionships.

We develop four features to capture the positive and negat ive relationship s between the di s putants. 1) Positive Quote Rate (PQR ab ): Given two di s-putants (a key opponent a , and a minor disputant b ), the feature measures the ratio of positive quotes between them. A sentence is considered as a pos i-tive quote if the following conditions hold: the se n-tence is a direct or indirect quote, the two disputants appear in the sentence, one is the subject of the quote, and a positive lexicon appears in the sentence. The number of such sentences is divided by the number of all quotes in which the two di s-p u tants appear and one appears as the subject. 2) Negative Quote Rate (NQR ab ): This feature is an opposite version of PQR. It measures the ratio of negative quotes between the two disputants. The same conditions are considered to detect negative quotes except that negative lexicon is used i n stead of positive lexicon. 3) Frequency of Standing Together (FST ab ): This feature attempts to capture whether the two disputants share a position, e.g.,  X  South Korea and U.S. both criticize d North Korea for... X  It counts how many times they are co -located or connected with the conjunction  X  X nd X  in the sentences. 4) Frequency of Division (FD ab ): This feature is an opposite version of the FST. It counts how many times they are not co -located in the sentences.
The same features are also calculated from the web news search results; we collect news articles of which the title includes the two disputants, i.e., a key opponent a and a minor disputant b . 
The calculation method of PQR and NQR is slightly a dapted since the titles are mostly not complete sentences. For PQR (NQR), it counts the titles which the two disputants appear with a pos i-tive (negative) lexicon. The counted number is d i-vided by the number of total search results. The calculation method o f FST and FD is the same e x-cept that they are calculated from the titles.

We combine the features obtained from web news search with the corresponding ones obtained from the article set by calculating a weighted sum. We currently give equal weights. 
The d isputants are partitioned by the following rule: given a minor disputant a , and the two key opp o nents b and c , 4.3 Article Classification Each news article of the set is classified by analy z-ing which side is importantly cover ed . The method classifies the articles into three categories, either to one of the two sides or the category  X  X t h er X .
We observed that the major components which shape an article on a contention are quotes from disp u tants and journalists  X  commentary . Thus, our method co n siders two points for classification: first, from which side the article X  X  quotes came; second, for the rest of the article X  X  text, the similarity of the text to the arg u ments of each side.

As for the quotes of an article, the method calc u-lates the proportion of the quotes from each side based on the disputant partitioning result. As for t he rest of the sentences, a similarity analysis is conducted with an SVM classifier. The classifier takes a sentence as input, determines its class to one of the three categories, i.e., one of the two side s , or ot h er . It is trained with the quotes from each side (tf.idf of unigram and bigram is used as features) . The same number of quotes from each side is used for training. The training data is pse u-do -relevant: it is automatically obtained based on the partitioning r esult of the previous stage. 
An article is classified to a specific side if more of its quotes are from that side and more sentences are similar to that side : given a n article a , and the two sides b and c , We currently set the parameters heuristically. We set 0.7 and 0.6 for the two parameters  X  and  X  respe c tively. Thus, for an article written purely with quotes, the article is classified to a sp e cific side if more than 70% of the quotes are from th at side. On the other hand, for an article which does not i n clude quote s from any side, more than 60% of the sentences have to be determined similar to a sp e cific side X  X  quotes. We set a lower value for  X  to classify articles with less number of biased se n-tences ( A rticles often include non -quote sentences unrelated to any side to give basic info r mation) . Our evaluation of the method is twofold: first, we evaluate the disputant partitioning results, second, the accuracy of classif ication. The method was evaluated using the same data set used for the cla s-sification frame comparison experiment. 
A gold result was created through the three h u-man annotators. To evaluate the disputant part i-tioning results, we had the annotators to extra ct the disputants of each issue, divide them into opposing two groups. We then created a gold partitioning result, by taking a union of the three annotators X  results. A gold classification is also created from the classification of the annotators. We resol ved the dis a greements between the annotators X  results by following the decision of the majority. 5.1 Evaluation of Disputant Partitioning We evaluated the partitioning result of the two o p-posing groups , denoted as G1 and G2 . The perfo r-mance is measured using p recision and recall. Table 2 presents the results. The pr e cision of the partitioning was about 70% on average. The false positives were mostly the disp u tants who appear only a few times both in the article set and the news search results . As they appeared rarely, there was not enough data to infer their position. T he effect of these false positives in article classific a-tion was limited. The recall was slightly lower than precision. This was mainly because some disputants were omitted in the disputant extra ction stage. The NER we used occasionally missed the names of unpop u-lar organizations, e.g., civic groups, and the extra c-tion rule failed to capture the subject in some complex sentences. However, most disputants who frequently appear in the article set we re extracted and partitioned appr o priately.
 5.2 Evaluation of Article Classification We evaluate our method and compare it with two unsupervised methods below .

Similarity -based clustering (Sim.) : The met h-od implements a typical method. It clusters articles of an issue into three groups based on text similar i ty. It uses tf.idf of unigram and bigram as features, and cosine similarity as the similarity mea s ure. We used the K -means clustering alg o rithm. 
Quote -based classification ( QbC.) : The met h-od is a par tial implementation of our method. The disp u tant extraction and disputant partitioning is performed identically; however, it classifies news articles merely based on quotes. An article is cla s-sified to one of the two opposing sides if more than 70% of the quotes are from that side , or to the  X  other  X  category othe r wise. 
Results: W e evaluated the classification result of the three categories , the two groups G1 and G2, and the category Other. The performance is mea s-ured using prec i sion, recall, and f -measure. We additionally used the weighted f -measure (wF) to aggr e gate the f -measure of the three categories. It is the weighted average of the three f -measures. The weight is proportional to the number of art i-cles in each category of the gold r e sult .

The disputa nt relation -based method (DrC) pe r-formed better than the two comparison methods. The overall average of the weighted f -measure among issues was 0.68, 0.59, and 0.48 for the DrC, QbC, and Sim. method, respectively (See Table 3 ) . The performance of the simi larity -based cluste r ing was lower than that of the other two in most issues.
A number of works have reported that text si m-ilarity is reliable in stance classification in polit i-cal domains. T hese experiments were conducted in political debate corpus ( Lin e t al. 2006) . Ho w-ever, news article set includes a number of articles covering different topics irrelevant to the arg u-ments of the disp u tants. For example, there can be an article describing general background of the co n tention. S imilarity -based clustering approach react ed sensitively to such articles and failed to capture the di f ference of the covered side . similarity -based approach as it classifies articles primarily based on the quoted disputants. The pe r-fo rmance is comparable to DrC in many issues. 
The met h od performs similarly to DrC if most articles of an issue include many qutes. DrC pe r-forms better for other issues which include a nu m ber of articles with only a few quotes.
 served three main reasons of misclassif i cation. 1) Articles with few quotes: Although the pr o-posed method better classifies such articles than the quote -based classification , there were some mi s classification s . There are sentences that are not directly related to the argument of any side, e.g., plain description of an event, summarizing the development of the issue, etc. The method made e r rors while trying to decide to which side these sentences are close to. Detecting such sentences and avoiding decisi ons for them would be one way of improvement. Research on classification of su b jective and objective sentences would be helpful ( Wiebe et al. 99 ) . 2) Article criticizing the quoted disputants: There were some articles criticizing the quoted disp u-tants. Fo r example, an article quoted the president fr e quently but occasionally criticized him between the quotes. The method misclassified such articles as it interpreted that the article is mainly delive r-ing the pres i dent X  X  argument. 3) Errors in disputant parti tioning: Some miscla s-sifications were made due to the errors in the di s-putant partitioning stage, specifically, those who were classified to a wrong side. Articles which refer to such disputants many times were miscla s-sified . We study the probl em of classifying news articles on contentious issues. It involves new cha l lenges as the discourse of contentious issues is complex, and news articles show different characteristics from co m monly studied corpus, such as product reviews. We propose opponent -based frame, and demonstrate that it is a clear and effective classif i-cation frame to contrast arguments of contentious issues. We develop disputant relation -based cla s-sification and show that the method outpe r forms a text similarity -based approach. 
Our metho d assumes polarization for conten -tious issues. This assumption was valid for most of the tested issues. For a few issues, there were some participants who do not belong to either side; however, they usually did not take a partic u-lar position nor make stro ng arguments. Thus, the effect on classific a tion performance was limited. Discovering and developing methods for issues which i n volve more than two disputants groups is a future work.
