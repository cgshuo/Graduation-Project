 latency problem, multiple copies of documents are distributed geographically and placed in caches at optimal locations. [5] The performance of Web servers is limited times across layers of software, for example between the file system and the scheduler and interrupt processing , can add further inefficiencies. map web page requests to web server cache to maximize hit ratio and at the same time of neural network. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the conceptual framework and formulation of the problem. The routing configuration of the web page requests based on neural networks is described in Section 3. Our Mathematical formulation using competitive learning is described in Section 4. We show the experimental results in section 5 and conclude in section 6. dynamic web objects because copies of data may have to go through several layers of software and file system, require intermediate processing, object fetches from cache, server cache at the router level. This router may be one of the servers or a dedicated machine to act as a server. and request count of the most frequently accessed objects are in the router X  X  memory. mapped onto high reliable outputs. We describe and present a new neural network-learning algorithm for a fast Web page allocation on a server using self-organizing properties of neural network. Our perfetching scheme predicts future requests according to the prototype vector of each illustrated in Figure 2. prefetcher requests all URL objects represented by the prototype vector, and the proxy server responds to the clients with prefetched URL objects. Application of the artificial neural networks, constructed on the basis of model E, for variables is different for each country. Two types of ANN models are constructed: 
The simple neuron with linear activation function GLRM [3], Where, b -the intercept (bias), b -are parameter estimates (j=0, 1, ... , 5; L=1, 2,..., 15). five MLP (5) units with the logistic activation function for the hidden layer and linear activation function for the output layer. Elements in the hidden layer are estimated on the basis of the following relation: for n = 1, 2 or n = 1, 2... 5, Where, f -the logistic function, ~ L y l j -standardized variables ) ( L ly j , c -the intercept -bias of the n-th unit in the hidden layer (n= 1, 2 or n = 1, 2... 5), variable from the j-the country (j = 0, 1... 5; L = 1, 2... 15). following relation: Where, d -the intercept -bias estimated for the output variable ) 1 ( 0 ly , d -are the estimated weights standing by n-th (n = 1... H ) unit in the hidden layer, H -number of elements in the hidden layers of the ANN.
 In this section, we present the results of our work. We discuss the performance of our K-Means clustering algorithm. As can be seen from figure 3, our neural network (NN) competitive learning algorithm performs much better as compared to Round Robin schemes (also RR2) [2]when input pages follow a Pareto distribution. As the number of input objects increase, our algorithm achiev es a hit ratio close to 0.993, whereas the round robin schemes never achieved a hit ratio of more than 0.3. In this paper, we present a novel application of connectionist neural modeling to map caches. Using our prefetching scheme, were able to obtain prediction accuracy as high as 98.18 %. 
In summary, we have presented a novel approach using a competitive model of requests and adapts itself to the load and the changing characteristics of web requests. Simulation results show an order of magnitude improvement over some existing techniques. The work was supported by NSFC (Grant No: 60173046) .
