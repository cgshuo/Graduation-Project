 Abstract: Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) is an interdisciplinary research area that combines first X order logic and machine learning methods for probabilistic inference. Although many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks (including text classification, semantic parsing, information extraction, coreference resolution, and sentiment analysis) can be formulated as inference in a first X order logic, most probabilistic first X order logics are not efficient enough to be used for large X scale versions of these tasks. In this tutorial, we provide a gentle introduction to the theoretical foundation of probabilistic logics, as well as their applications in NLP. We describe recent advances in designing scalable probabilistic logics, with a special focus on ProPPR. Finally, we provide a hands X on demo about scalable probabilistic logic programming for solving practical NLP problems.
 Outline: About the Instructors: William Yang Wang: Carnegie Mellon University, yww@cs.cmu.edu,  X  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yww/ William Wang is a final X year PhD student at the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. He works with William Cohen on designing scalable learning and inference algorithms for statistical relational learning, knowledge reasoning, and information extraction. He has published about 30 papers at leading conferences and journals including ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL. He has received best paper awards (or nominations) at ASRU, CIKM, and EMNLP, a best reviewer award at NAACL 2015, the Richard King Mellon Presidential Fellowship in 2011, and he is a Facebook Fellowship finalist. He is an alumnus of Columbia University, and a former research scientist intern at Yahoo! Labs, Microsoft Research Redmond, and University of Southern California.
 William W. Cohen: Carnegie Mellon University, wcohen@cs.cmu.edu, http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wcohen/ William Cohen is a professor of machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University. Dr. Cohen's research interests include information integration and machine learning, particularly information extraction, text categorization and learning from large datasets. He has a long X standing interest in statistical relational learning and learning models, or learning from data, that display non X trivial structure. He holds seven patents related to learning, discovery, information retrieval, and data integration, and is the author of more than 200 publications. He was a past president of International Machine Learning Society. He is a AAAI fellow, and was a winner of SIGMOD Test of Time Award and SIGIR Test of Time Award.
