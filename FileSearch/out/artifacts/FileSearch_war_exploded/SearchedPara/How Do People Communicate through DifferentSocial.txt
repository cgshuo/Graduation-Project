 Advances in technology have brought many communication channels for people in daily life, like E-mail, blogs/micro-blog and mobile telecommunication etc. Now and in the future it is going to be critical that people use multiple com-munication channels to reach each other. One interesting and also fundamental question is: would people exhibit consistent or totally different communication habits in different communication channels? To explore this problem, in this pa-per we specifically selected two of the most significant channels as the objects for comparison. One is online social network, e.g., Twitter as representative of such networks, and another is mobile telecommunication.

Online social network(OSN), emerge d as a new medium, has flourished as never before. Meanwhile, continuous developments in mobile telecommunication technology have improved the way by which people engage with each other and constructed another kind of mobile social network(MSN). No matter online social network or mobile social network, all they provide a platform where individuals with similar interests or commonalitie s can be connected with one another eas-ily and efficiently. In recent years, the expl oration of user social communication behaviors has captured a lot of attention. However, most of existing work focus on one particular kind of social network separately. In this paper, we conduct a deep analysis to compare the patterns of user X  X  behaviors through online and mobile social connections from various p erspectives, including temporal, geo-graphical and topological features. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study investigating the behavioral patterns comparisons from multiple perspective. Essentially, this paper tries to answer the questions: 1. Does the communication in different social networks have distinguished tem-poral properties? 2. Does the geographic location influence the communications in different social network? 3. Are there some significant topologica l difference between different social net-work?
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we give a detailed description of data collection for mobile and online social network. Then we implement the behavior analysis from three dimensions of time, location and topology in section 3, 4 and 5. Finally, in Section 6 and 7, we summarize related works and come to a conclusion. In this paper, the experiments are conducted on two data sets. One is Reality Mining dataset 1 [4] , which contains the call logs, SMS logs, GSM cell informa-tion and Bluetooth scan collected from 106 subjects for more than 9 months. AnotherisTwitterdata 2 , which consists of 103,452 Twitter user information and 211,509,594 tweets for about 9 months.

The Reality Mining Datasetconsists of the tracking data of people X  X  daily ac-tivities on the smart phones. It is the first mobile data set with rich personal behavior and interpersonal interactions and contains 162,699 communication records (128,542 call logs and 34,157 short message logs). Specifically, the infor-mation utilized in our study includes:  X  Date, time, duration, direction and originator/recipient of each call and short message.  X  A label indicating whether a call is missed or not.  X  The location information, which is in the form of GSM cell information.  X  The inferred proximity information. Bluetooth device can detect other Blue-tooth devices within a range of 5-10m. Based on it, we can deduce whether two subjects are in close proximity to each other.

For the data set for online social network analysis, we choose Twitter as the source for data collection since it is one of the most popular online social networks and described as  X  X he SMS of the Internet X , and record various information of user X  X  interactions on Twitter, including time, frequency, forward and comment etc, as well as user personal profile, like location, fans and followers etc. In this section, we lay emphasis on various time factors of user interaction in mobile and online social network. For better understanding of these factors, we proceed with a definition of these facto rs and then a detailed observations and analysis. 3.1 Periodicity of Communication Periodicity of communication is the tendency of communication happening at regularly-spaced periods of time. To explore the periodicity facts under differ-ent social networks, Our study gives the observations of 24-hour and one-week periodicity under different social networks.
  X  24-hour periodicity. As shown in Figure 1(a), the communications in mobile social network, either call or SMS, exhi bit a clear periodicity of lower prob-ability in the morning and higher probability at night. But comparatively, the periodicity in online social netwo rk is not quite clear and presents a smoother curve of communication probability through a day.  X  one-week periodicity. Similarly, the probability of communication in online social network fluctuates less than that in mobile social network during a week. As shown in Figure 1(b), the variance of phone-call and SMS prob-ability during a week is 2 . 5  X  10  X  4 and 1 . 1  X  10  X  4 variance of communication probability in online social network is 1 . 8 3.2 Instant Reply Given a time limit  X  ,ifuser a sends a message to user b at time t , and user b sends a message back to user a within the time limit  X  , the message sent back is defined as an instant reply . In this paper, instant reply is evaluated from two aspects more detailedly, including reply time and is reply rate.  X  Reply Time. Figure 2(a) shows the probability of the elapsed time before message reply. From this figure, it can be seen that more time is taken for response in online social network. Especially, the curve for online social network peaks at about 60s, while the peak in mobile social network is about 45s. It proves that the communication online is more random than that in mobile social network.  X  Reply Rate. Figure 2(b) gives the Cumulative Distribution Functions(CDF) curves of users with respect to the instant reply rate. We observe that the reply rate for most mobile users is between 0.2 and 0.4. It means that less than half of the messages will be replied. Comparatively, the reply rate varies widely for online users and the maximal reply rate can achieve 0.8. 3.3 Conversation If user a and user b iteratively send and reply message to each other , all the messages in the discussion thread form a conversation . In this section, we inves-tigate the conversation by observing the conversation duration and conversation details .  X  Conversation Duration. Figure 3(a) illustrates the CDF curves of conversa-tion duration in different social netwo rks. The first observation is that most conversations last less than 1000 seconds. The second one is there are rare short conversation (shorter than 100 seconds) in online social network, while short conversations occupy about 55% in mobile social network. This obser-vation is consistent with the observations for instant reply. Online users tend to communicate with each other freely and the conversation can last for long time.  X  Details of Conversation. To capture the micro-leve l characteristics of con-versation, we plot the details of elapsed time in each round of conversation. Illustrated by Figure 3(b), the average time in the beginning of a conversa-tion is longer (150-200s), but as the conversation progresses, the interaction averagely takes less and less time. This phenomenon can be observed in both mobile and online social network. It reveals the process of how a conversation gradually captures people X  X  attention and interests. Location is an important element in social network analysis[11]. It is expected that the communcation through social network can break the geographical re-strictions and becomes more freely and easily. In this section, our study will investigate whether or not the communication between people in different social network is limited by geographic constraints. The trend of communication in regard to geographic distance is studied.  X  Online social network. As we know, the exposure of location information in online social network always depends on user themselves. Generally, it is hard to extract the location inform ation accurately and completely. As a substitution, we consider the time zone as an approximate indicator of location to measure the geographic distance between online users.
 Figure 4(a) demonstrates the probability distribution of communication with respect to time zones. It is interesting to find that most communication oc-curs between users with 1 hour of time zone difference. As the time zone dif-ference increases, the communication probability decreases. However, when the time zone difference reaches more than 4 hours, the fluctuation of com-munication probability flattens out. The result indicates that the commu-nications between online users is out of distance constraints. Online users would like to make new friends and expand their social circles.  X  Mobile social network. In this part of study, the geographic co-occurrence is estimated as the average geographic d istance between users. Two methods are applied to measure the co-occurrence. One is based on Bluetooth De-vice, which can record the proximity within 5-10m range. Another is based on GSM, which can cover about 100 meter distance. The communication distribution with respect to the numbe r of co-occurrence is demonstrated in Figure 4(b). It can be seen that the higher co-occurrence of people within close proximity to each other, the more communication they have. Except temporal and spatial factor, topological structure hidden behind the communication is also important for the mining of user behavior patterns on social network. Before the detailed study and comparison, let X  X  first take a look at the communication structur e of different social network.

Figure 5(a) shows the Reality Mining communication structure. The red nodes represent subjects to be observed in our data and grey ones represent nodes having communication with the red nodes. Here, we ignore all the nodes that have less than one degree for clarity. A linkage will be setup between users with more than 5 times interaction and the red link highlights the connection between two red nodes. Moreover, the width of line represents the correlation coefficient of two nodes. The more width of the link, the more correlation it has. Similarly, Figure 5(b) shows the communication structure of online social network, where the inner nodes constitute a large sub-network and represent the communities with close communication.

Discussion above gives a high-level introduction of the different topological structures in social networks. In the following, we will implement more deep discussion on the granularity of node, node pair and network perspectively. 5.1 Node-level Analysis  X  Degree Property. Generally, degree is used to descr ibe the association strength of a given node with other nodes. By observing the degree of each node, we plot the CDF curves as shown in Figure 6(a). In this study, the link between nodes is considered as undirected. It can be observed that over 60% of nodes in online social network have less than 50 degrees, whereas in mobile social network about 80% of nodes have more than 40 degrees.
 To more accurately explore the communication between nodes, we further make a study under the directed graph. An arch from A to B will be estab-lished if A has a talk to B . Based on the directed gr aph, we consider the ratio of in-degree to out-degree ( d in d illustrated in Figure 6(b). The result for online social network shows that there are more than 30% of nodes without any in-degree and more than 25% without any out-degree. Besides, about half of nodes has more out-degree than in-degree, 40% of nodes has more in-degree and 10% of nodes has the same in-degree and out-degree. In mobile social network, about 85% of users have more out-degrees, but few have no in-degree or no out-degree. As a summary of the difference, the ratio of degree in mobile social network varies from 0.1 to less than 10, whereas the ratio in online social network varies from less than 0.1 to more than 10.  X  Communication Reciprocity. Previous studies reported the low level of reci-procity on Twitter [9]. It is also proved by our experiments. The experimental results indicate that 74.25% of linked users is connected one-way, and only 25.75% pairs have reciprocal relationship. Comparatively, reciprocity in mo-bile social network is originally thought to be higher. But we surprisingly discovered from the experiment result that mobile social network also has this property. It shows that only 21.9% of user pairs in mobile social network has reciprocal relationship, even less than that in online social network.  X  Communication Diversity. We characterize the top-k correspondents for each user based on the frequency of communications. Figure 7 highlights the me-dian portion of users X  communications covered by the top-k correspondents. We find that for both mobile and online social network over 50% of commu-nications are covered by top-5 corresp ondents. It shows that in any social network people would like to or need to interact with a fixed set of friends. 5.2 Pair-wised Analysis After the node-level discussion, let X  X  turn to the pair-wised analysis to explore the influence of social connections on communication. A general question is whether the users who share many common neighbors in social network are more likely to be as friends? We transfer this exploration to a prediction problem. The task is to predict the communication link betw een people in different social network by considering different facto rs of topological structure.
 To do it, we select four months of data and split them into two equal parts. Then, the next step is to detect unprecedented communication links in the second time period by referring the topological characteristics generalized from the first time period. Here, we consider thre e kinds of topological feature.  X  Average Degree(Ave-Deg). Average degree is to describe the linkage status of user. One hypothesis is that user with more linkages tends to build new connection with other s. Given two users r and s , the average degree is defined as below.
 where d ( s ) means the link degree of user s .  X  Common Neighbor Number(CN-Num). Common neighbors can always in-dicate the affinity of users. Intuitively, users with more common neighbors have more chance to talk with each other.  X  Common Neighbor Strength(CN-Str). Besides the observation of common neighbors, the similarity of connection strength with neighbors is another evidence for affinity. Given two users r and s , the strength similarity is defined as below, where N ( r, s ) is the set of all common neighbors of user r and s , m ( v,r )is the communication count between user v and r .

By considering the factors defined above respectively, we can get a ranking list of user pair. The top ones are users predicted to be connected. We use nDCG@ k to evaluate the performance. From the results shown in Table 1, we have some interesting findings.
  X  For online social network, all the three topological features are good evidence for communication prediction. Inversely, the communication probability is hard to be predicted for mobile social network. It proves again that users are easier to make friends through online social network. Furthermore, it shows that the transparence of online social network is actually a promotion for people to connect to friends of friends.  X  The performance of CN-Num and CN-Str based prediction is better than that of Ave-Deg based prediction. However, it can be noted that the perfor-mance of Ave-Deg has a notable raise with the increase of k .  X  CN-Str based approach performs better than CN-Num based approach for mobile social network, but it is on the other side for online social network. 5.3 Network-Based Analysis Node-level and Pair-wised analysis explain the influence of topological features on communication from micro perspective. In this section, we will discuss it from a macro angle of view to disclose the role of people in their communication.
We first give an introduction of social status theory. According to the theory of Social status[5], an arch from A to B indicates that A has a higher status than B and all triangles in the network should be acyclic.

Based on the theory of social status, Figure 8(a) lists 7 types of triads. For easy understanding, given a triad ( A, B, C ), we use 1 to denote a directed arch and 0 to denote an undirected edge. Thus label 011 denotes an undirected edge between A and B , and two directed links from C to A and B respectively. To be noticed, one triad defined in this figure violates the social theory, and is labeled as unsatisfied triad.

We make a statistics of all 7 types of triangles on both mobile and online social network. As illustrated in Figure 8(b), mobile and online social network have similar results in violation cases and for both social network, only small part of triangles violate the theory. However, these two social networks have totally different distributions on other triads. In mobile social network, the case of  X 101 X  is more distinguished than others, but comparatively, the most outstanding cases in online social network are  X 100 X  and  X 110 X . Various online and social networking services provide different channels for com-munication. It therefore spurred the researches into the characteristics study for different social networking[2].

Twitter, as a new form of online social network, has attracted much attention in recent years. Characterizing user b ehavior in Twitter is discussed widely.
Different work explored this problem f rom different angles. Sue et al. analyzed information spreading and impact of ret weet over the entire Twitter sphere[9]. Wu et al. investigated the flow of information among different categories of users[15]. Huberman et al. reported that the number of friends is actually smaller than the number of followers or followings[6].
Mobile social network, as a traditional and typical kind of social network, has been studied a lot from the perspective o f communication behavior. Onnela et al. analyzed the structure and tie strengths in call-based mobile communication networks[13]. Banjo et al. developed a theoretical model to illustrate the social effects for cell phone usage in public places[1]. Miklas et al. investigated how to use mobile systems to exploit people X  X  social interactions [12]. Yuan et al. studied the inference of user emot ional status from mobile communication network[16]. Wang et al. explored the influential nodes in mobile social network based on communication status[14].

Some communication analysis on other kinds of social network also have been studied, such as, the work from Karagiannis et al. on email social network analysis[8], the work of Leskovec et al. on instant-messaging network mining[10] and the logs-based comparison of search patterns across different platforms from Kamvar et al.[7].

Existing approaches did a lot of work on social communication study. However, they barely explore this problem against different social networks simultaneously. This paper presents a comparison study to identify the communication patterns of people through different social connections. It is a new and interesting topic for research. In this paper, we discussed and presented user communication properties in different social network from three aspects: time, location and topology.  X  The observations from temporal analysis included: 1) Communications in mobile social network exhibit a clear periodicity, but no any regularity can be found in online social network; 2) The messages in Mobile social network always gets low reply rate but more quick response, while the opposite case in online social network; 3) During a conversation, the reply time in both social network reduces gradually; 4) The conversation in online social network has longer duration compared with that in mobile social network.  X  The observations from geographical analysis showed that compared with mo-bile social network, the communications in online social network happened without geographical restrictions.  X  The observations from topology analysis found that: 1)There is very low level of reciprocity for both mobile and online social network; 2) Over 50% of communications in both mobile and online social network happened with only small set of contact.
