 Before the introduction of the algorithm, we first give some notations and defi-nition of the task of recommendation. Let U = { u 1 ,u 2 ,  X  X  X  ,u m } be the user set, I = { i 1 ,i 2 ,  X  X  X  ,i n } be the item set and R m  X  n be the rating matrix where R u,j represents the rating score of user u gives to the item j . In a social trust network G =( U, E ) where the vertices are all the users and the edge set E denotes the trust relations between users. Let T m  X  m be the trust matrix where T u,v =1if user u trusts user v , otherwise 0. The task of our model is to predict the missing values in R for the users by employing the trust network and user-item rating matrix. 3.1 Our Dynamic User Adaptive Hybrid Model with Trust As far as we know, there is no research has directly integrate the prediction of the trust-aware methods and matrix factorization techniques. Firstly, we integrate trust-aware method and matrix factorization into a simple hybrid model with a constant trade-off parameter  X  , and its probabilistic function can be defined as: where N ( x |  X ,  X  2 ) is the probability density function of the Gaussian distribution with mean  X  and variance  X  2 , X  r T u,i is the predicted rating of user u to item i by a trust-aware method, and I u,i is the indictor function.
 for each user, the prediction accuracy should be diverse for each user. Motivated by the aforementioned, we then propose a dynamic user adaptive hybrid model to predict the missing ratings, which combines a trust-aware method and matrix factorization with the user adaptive tradeoff parameters. We call it DTMF, which can dynamically integrate the trust-aware recommendation method and collab-orative filtering. The predicted rating for dynamic user adaptive hybrid model can be defined as: 4.2 Performance Analysis We report the MAE and RMSE values of all comparison methods on Epinions and Flixster in Table 2 . We observe that our method DTMF constantly out-performs HybTMF on both data sets. This demonstrates that DTMF model can learn proper parameters for every user and select the appropriate ways to combine matrix factorization and Trust methods. To show the significance of our performance improvement, we add t-test to test the significance levels of our model compared to other comparison parters and find p-value is less than 0.01 on both data sets.
 Due to the uneven distributions of ratings and relations, different algorithm may benefit each user to different extents.In this paper, we present a dynamic user adaptive hybrid recommendation model which combines matrix factorization and a trust-aware based method with user adaptive tradeoff parameters. By comparing with static combination parameters, the experimental results verify that user adaptive parameters could improve the prediction accuracy.
