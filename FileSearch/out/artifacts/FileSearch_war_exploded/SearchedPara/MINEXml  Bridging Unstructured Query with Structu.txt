The retrieval of structured res ources using unstructured queries is challenging as we need to deal with the matching between entities of two different types. Consider an unstructured query,  X  X ublications of K.H. Gan in WI  X , in a structured retrieval system. To match this query to structured resources, the system needs to transform it into a form at that is comparable to the structure of the resources. As such, we develop a solution that automatically transform unstructured query to a mediated query which is enhanced with structural information. The mediated query is then matched against structured resources to obtain relevant results. 
To build the mediated query, additional structural information can be obtained from manual created data like data dictionaries, domain ontology, or automated process like machine learning. Manual methods work well for solv ing retrieval problems within a domain or in an agreed situati on. However, due to the diversity and dynamicity of the web, it is certainly not enough to only refer to available standards that tell us what a piece of information means (in this case, what structural information a keyword may be related to) on the web. In mo st cases, we cannot find most of the related information from manual created data. With respect to this, the system addresses this limitation by learning the semantics from structured resources in the repository. Here are two examples of simplified semantic prediction models for keywords,  X  X I X  and  X  X ublications X , obtaine d from the learning process, cpt :state, ctx :location] or publications  X  [ ctx :conference; ctx :workshop; ctx :journal]. The model shows the association of a keyword, T and its concept, cpt and context, ctx , given as T  X  [ cpt 1 , ctx 1 ; cpt 2 , ctx 2 ; ...; cpt n , ctx interpretation what a keyword ma y be related to base on the common definitions used on the web. 
If we looked at the semantic ca ndidates of  X  X I X , its semantic prediction model gives us two di fferent concepts. A geographical data dictionary associates it to &lt;state&gt;, while the semantic Here, we can see that the differen ces in semantic will affect the retrieved elements, if incorrect in formation is chosen to annotate the keyword  X  X I X . To select the best structural information to annotate this keyword, the system needs to select the best concept that satisfies the query context (based on common context reflected by keywords in the query). In this case, we infer that this query is relevant to  X  ctx :conference X  from our semantic prediction models. To preserve a less rigid query representation for query resource matching, we represen t unstructured query as query fragment trees (q1) instead of si ngle structured query. We show a simplified mediated query in Fig. 1 that is annotated with structural information obtained from the prediction models. Figure 1: Mediated query for, q1 and indexed XML element, e1. 
To find relevant results for a query, the system matches the mediated query with a set of resource elements candidates. A less restrictive approach is used by indexing all the elements, but we do filter out not meaningful inde xing unit using a stop list, e.g. calculate the context similarity score based on two factors, i) similar of nodes (using Levenstein edit distance algorithm) and ii) nodes overlapping between trees. The similarity score is used in resource elements ranking. 
In this demonstration, we s how a research prototype that enables the search of xml elemen ts using unstructured query. We will show the processes on how the unstructured query is mapped into the mediated query, candidature of xml elements wrt. the mediated query, and lastly a ranke d list of matched elements.
