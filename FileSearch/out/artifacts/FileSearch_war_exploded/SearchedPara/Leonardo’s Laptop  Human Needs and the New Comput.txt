 The old computing was about what computers could do; the new computing is about what people can do. To accelerate the shift from the old to the new computing designers need to: 2. promote universal usability. Interfaces must be tailorable to a wide range of hardware, software, and networks, Leonardo da Vinci could help as an inspirational muse for the new computing. His example could push designers to new computing, which emphasizes empowerment, creativity, and collaboration. Information visualization and personal photo interfaces will be shown: PhotoMesa (www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/photomesa) and PhotoFinder (www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/photolib).
