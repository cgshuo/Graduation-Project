 This research explores the re lationship between Information Retrieval (IR) systems X  effectiveness and users X  performance (accuracy and speed) and their satisfaction with the retrieved results (precision of the results, completeness of the results and overall system success). Previous studies have concluded that improvements in IR systems based on increase in IR effectiveness measures do not re flect on improvement in users X  performance. This work aims at exploiting factors that can possibly be considered as conf ounding variables in Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) evaluation. In this research, we look at substantive approaches to evaluate IIR systems. We aim to build an interactive evaluation framework that brings together aspects of systems X  effectiveness and users X  performance and satisfaction. This research al so involves developing methods for capturing users X  satisfaction with the retrieved results of IR systems, as well as examination how users assess their own performance in task completion. Furthermore, we are also interested in identifying evaluation measures which are used in batch mode (non-interactive experi ment), but correlate well in interactive IR systems. Thus, by the end of this research, we hope to develop a valid and reliab le metrics for IIR evaluation. A first study was set up to explore the relationship between system effectiveness as quantified by traditional measures, such as precision and recall, and users X  effectiveness and satisfaction of the results, though this study was limited to few users. The tasks involve finding images fo r recall-based tasks. It was concluded that no direct relationship between system effectiveness and users X  performance. People learn to adapt to a system regardless to its effectiveness. This study recommends that a combination of measures (e.g. system effectiveness, user performance and satisfaction) to be used to evaluate IIR systems. Based on our observati on from this study, we found that users X  familiarity of the search topic has increased their performance. Thus, we set up a second experiment to investigate how users X  satisfaction correlate with some IR effectiveness measures such as precision and the suite of Cumulative Gain measures (CG, DCG, NDCG) in simple web sear ching tasks. Results from this study have shown that CG and Precision are better than NDCG at reflecting users X  satisfaction with the results of an IR system. We have also concluded that user s of web search engines, in the context of simple search task, are more concerned with precision than completeness of the search. This stemmed from the stronger correlation between users X  satisfaction with the success of overall search and their satisfaction with the accuracy of the
