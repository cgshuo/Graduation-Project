Microarray is a high-throughput technology that allows the expression levels up to thousands of genes to be measured simultaneously. The analysis of microarray data is one of the major interests in health informatics [1] that aims at understanding the underlying genetic causes of human diseases. For instance, classification of microarray data allows the discovery of hidden patterns in gene expression profiles and opens the possib ility for more accurate and reliabl e disease diagnosis.

The main challenge in building microarray classification models is the curse of dimensionality prob-lem, where there are a huge number of genes compared to a small number of samples in the datasets [2 X  4]. This may reduces the accuracy and speed of classification models [5], as conventional classification methods are not designed to cope wi th high-dimensional datasets [ 6] and are prone to overfitting [7]. Besides, it is also likely lead to false positives, where gene combinations may be correlated with a target class purely by chance, or a gene is declared to be differentially expressed but actually it is not [8].
To alleviate this problem, a considerable amount of gene selection methods have been suggested in the literature to identify relevant genes for building effective classification models [5,9,10]. An example of a well-known gene selection approach is filter method. The drawback of this method is that it evaluates each gene individually without considering the interactions between them. Thus, filter method is nor-mally combined with other methods to compensate its disadvantages. The most common combination is the hybrid model of filter and wrapper methods as in [11]. Though wrapper method is capable of finding optimal gene subset, it is classifier dependent and has a higher risk of overfitting the data. In another study, [12] had proposed a hybrid approach that combines both filter and clustering methods for group-ing genes with similar expression profiles. However, opposed to the fact that a gene can interact with several other genes, basic clustering assign each gene to only one cluster and it is unable to show the relationships between genes within the cluster. To overcome this, biclustering methods are suggested, however they may have limitation in term of exhaustive search of the entire feature subsets [48].
In addition to that, most of the existing methods ar e purely data-centric and are based on statisti-cal analyses. The use of microarray data alone are not sufficient, as the expression values may not be measured accurately and the complexity of microarray experiments may cause discrepancies in the data obtained. On the other hand, statistical significance is not able to be translated directly to biological relevance [13] and provide little information about the relationships among genes. As a result, the clas-sification models built by such methods are less interpretable and are unlikely to generate new biological insights.

Therefore, in the past few years, integrative analysis has emerged as an attractive approach for mining microarray data. According to [14], the term  X  X ntegrative analysis X  can be described as the analysis of high throughput data in the context of available biological knowledge. It is widely agreed that the use of biological knowledge in microarray data analysis helps to reduce the dimensionality problem by targeting only at genes that are involved in the underlying mechanisms of targeted classes [15].
The limitations of existing integrative approaches are the grouping of genes is still based on expression data alone and external biological knowledge is just used as a subsequent process to verify the exper-imental results and to gain biological insights [16,17] or validation [49]. Apart from that, most of the integrative approaches incorporate only one type of biological knowledge at a time when carrying out the analysis [3,17,18]. Gene Ontology (GO) is an example of biological knowledge that is commonly used for integrative analysis in the context of microarray. According to [50], using single form of bio-logical data may result in missing of some interesting discoveries or valuable information. Thus, further attempts should be done to develop methods that are able to simultaneously integrate microarray data with other additional biological information, such as protein-protein interaction, metabolic pathways and promoter binding [19]. Although, there are some existing integrative approaches that include multiple biological data types, most of them are using unsupervised learning methods for discovering regulatory modules and regulatory motifs, rather than for classification of targeted diseases [51,52].
Hence, this study aims to group genes not only by considering their expression values but also with their additional biological knowledge in the same framework. In relation to that, association analysis can be one of the methods to integrate these heterogeneous data into a single dataset for finding interesting relationships among genes. This paper presents an integrative framework to the task of gene selection for improving classification performance in terms of accuracy and number of selected genes. The proposed gene selection method employed information gain and association analysis techniques to integrate both microarray data and gene information in identifying set of discriminative and informative genes. The integrative classification models have been tested on four cancer-related microarray datasets, and two types of biological knowledge were incorporated into the selection process, namely Gene Ontology (GO) [20] and KEGG Pathways (KEGG) [21]. The experimental results showed that the recommended GO based models, KEGG based models, and GO-KEGG based models outperformed the expression-only models by attaining better classification accuracies with less number of genes. Besides, the selected genes can be traced back to their functional annotations and association groups for interpretation and creating new hypotheses for future investigation.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces an integrative framework for the classification of microarray data. Section 3 describes the proposed integrative gene selection based on association analysis. The experimental results are presented in Section 4 and discussed in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper and discusses on some possible future directions. 2. An integrative framework for microarray data classification
Figure 1 shows the proposed integrative framework for implementing microarray data classification system in an integrated context. The approach is created based on the Knowledge Discovery Process model [22] in data mining and the general scheme for integrative analysis in high-throughput data [14]. There are five main phases involved, namely data collection, data preparation, data integration, gene selection and classification. The phases are organized as a flow of data that are subsequently processed by several components. As can be seen in the framework, association analysis technique is implemented in the data integration and gene selection phases. The details of each phase are discussed in the rest of this section. 2.1. Data collection
This phase includes the process of collecting microarray data and biological information from relevant sources. Most of the data can be found from public repositories or related web servers. To get started, first identify the target microarray dataset to be study and download the source files (usually in flat files). The datasets are generally from published papers with experiments on different species A list of gene identifiers is then extracted from the microarray data to retrieve gene annotations from relevant public biological databases. The annotations are actually the biological discoveries made by scientists and recorded in electronic format to be share through open knowledge bases. In order to access this biological information, one needs to have unique identifiers (IDs) to retrieve corresponding database entries. The conversion from one ID format to another can easily be done by using available tool such as the IDConverter [23] and the SOURCE [24]. 2.2. Data preparation
Data preparation is an essential phase in microarray data analysis to amend data for downstream algorithms. Two main preprocessing tasks are addressed in this phase, which are data cleaning and data transformation. Both microarray data and biological data are preprocessed separately and can be described as follows. 2.2.1. Microarray data preprocessing
In a raw microarray dataset, not all entries are relevant for running classification. Therefore, data cleaning is needed to eliminate the irrelevant entries and includes only relevant entries, which are genes and their corresponding expression values from each sample. In addition, the missing gene expression values are replaced by mean value and redundant records are removed. The transformation of variables is also an important task in preprocessing and it affects the performance of classification. Two common data transformation applied on raw microarray dataset is standardization and discretization, where the continuous gene expression values are transformed into a form that is appropriate for further mining. In standardization [25], each gene expression measured is converted to zero mean and one standard deviation across all samples with the following formula: where x ik is the expression measure for k th gene in the i th sample, while  X  x and s k denote respectively the mean and standard deviation for the k th genes across n samples. Such standardization allows all genes to be weighed equally in the classification. On the other hand, discretization techniques can be used to divide continuous expression value into interval values. By doing this, it reduces the number of values for a gene and especially beneficial for some classification methods. For instance, microarray data was normally discretized with the entropy-based discretization method [26]. Given a set of samples S in k classes, the entropy (or information-content) is defined as: where p i is the probability of class i in S . Then, let selects an interval boundary T for gene X i ,which partition the samples into subsets S 1 and S 2 . The entropy resulting from the partitioning is: where Ent ( S j ) , ( j =1 , 2) corresponds to the entropy for a subset of S according to the definition: where P ( C i ,S j ) is the probability of samples in S j that have class C i . The process of determining the interval boundary is recursively applied until some stopping criterion is met. The best split for binary discretization is the boundary that minimizes the entropy function over all potential boundaries. 2.2.2. Biological data preprocessing
Biological data retrieved from tools such as the SOURCE [24], the GENETOOLS [27] often contains unwanted details and simple file preprocessing are needed. The retrieved annotations need to be put orderly in files, which consist of the unique annotation identifiers (annotation ID), list of genes annotated, and descriptions. To ease the further processing of gene annotations, two flat files can be prepared. One of the files contains gene IDs and their corresponding annotation IDs, while the other file contains annotation IDs and their corresponding annotation descriptions. 2.3. Data integration
Integrative analysis often involved the merging of different kind of data from multiple sources . In this phase, a data integrator is needed to integrate information from microarray dataset and their annotations into a single file that is appropriate for mining. The transformation method and the type of new data are depending on the method to be used on the subsequent process. A gene-annotation mapping component is also added to map candidate genes with their annotations and discriminative scores. This is required since the microarray dataset and the retrieved annotations are on different files. The matching process is done by using the unique identifier for each gene and their functional annotation identifier.
This paper constructed transaction databases that are suitable for association analysis. Depending on the type of associations to be extracted, a microarray dataset is transformed into a transaction data format before it can be further analyzed using association analysis. The transaction data is constructed from the microarray data and annotation data. From the microarray data, a list of genes is extracted and gene an-notations are retrieved from the biological data prepare in the earlier phase. Then a transaction database is created based on gene annotations as this study aims to extract interesting relationship among genes based on their biological properties. In the transaction database, the genes are treated as  X  X tems X  while the annotations are treated as  X  X ransactions X . Only differentially expressed genes will be considered in the transaction data, where their discriminative scores from filter method are not equal to zero. The com-putation of discriminative score will be discussed in the next section. Figure 2 shows the construction of a transaction database by using the KEGG annotations. The transactional data in Fig. 2 can be further transformed to include the discriminative scores for each gene as shown in Fig. 3. By doing so, it retains the information from gene expression profiles and further helps to sort the genes within a transaction for generating frequent itemsets and in identifying representative genes. This study uses discriminative scores to compute the interestingness of each frequent itemset.
 2.4. Gene selection
In this phase, a gene selection method is introduced to reduce the number of selected genes by remov-ing irrelevant, redundant, or noisy data [28]. For microarray data analysis, gene selection or also known as feature selection is an indispensable task to identify differentially expressed genes and to remove ir-relevant genes in high dimensional datasets. In this paper, the proposed gene selection method employed the filter method and association analysis to identify discriminative and informative genes. In addition, a conventional gene ranking method is used to find the best gene subset. The details of the proposed method are described in Section 3. 2.5. Classification
This phase handles the classification of DNA microarray data, given the selected genes from the gene selection method. The tasks include selecting suitable classification algorithm, building classifier, and classification evaluation. Indeed, the proposed system allows the use of any of the classifiers and algo-rithms to evaluate the effectiveness of the created gene subsets. The final selected gene subset is expected to produce better classification results, in term of accuracy compare to traditional methods. WEKA is an example of software that provides a wide range of classifiers with error estimation methods. In this study, three well-known classifiers are imported from the WEKA packages, namely the Na X ve Bayes (NB), Lo-gistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These classification algorithms have been used widely in previous studies [3,12,29 X 32], thus are suitable to be included in the experiments for fair comparisons.

For classification evaluation, the  X  X eave-one-out cross-validation X  (LOOCV) is a common evaluation method used error estimation. Under LOOCV, the training and testing are performed n times, where n is the number of initial samples. The classifier is trained on n -1 samples and tested the remaining one sample. This is iterated so that each sample is used once as the validation data. The classification accuracy can be estimated by dividing the number of correctly classified test samples from all iterations, m with n , as in the following formula:
The LOOCV is computationally expensive as it involved n times of complete model reconstruction for a dataset of n samples size. However, a LOOCV method is acceptable to use for small-sample microarray analysis as it is a straightforward method and gives and almost unbiased error estimation [33]. LOOCV is one of the most frequently used methods to estimate classification performance in microarray studies [34]. Finally, the last step involves presenting the classification results in preferred formats (e.g. graph and chart). From the results, comparisons with traditional expression-only methods and other integrative method are done to determine the performance of the proposed approach. Interpretation is drawn from the results and new knowledge is be generated by studying the biological information of selected genes. 3. The integrative gene selection with association analysis
This paper proposed a new method to improve the current gene selection in microarray data. The gene selection method combined the strength of both filter and association analysis to identify relevant genes. The suggested model as shown in Fig. 4 is able to integrate additional biological knowledge to uncover associations among genes and select discriminative and informative gene subsets for microarray data classification. Gene ranking method is used to rank frequent itemsets based on their interestingness and to form potential gene subsets. 3.1. Filter method
Mining on a reduced data set would make analysis more practical and efficient. Data reduction tech-niques are applied on dataset to reduce the volume, yet still maintain the integrity of the original data and produce consistent analytical results [35]. Filter method is a well-known technique in microarray analysis to reduce the number of genes. This is because it is scalable to high-dimensional datasets, com-putational simple and fast, and is independent of classification algorithm. The filtering method helps to remove a substantial amount of genes in the microarray data, which is important for the next stage of the selection process.
 This study used a filter method in the early stage to calculate the discriminative power of each gene. The genes are then ranked according to their discriminative score, and genes with discriminative score equal to zero will be removed. Calculating the information gain value is one of the ways to find the discriminative score, which is the importance of each gene with respect to class labels. The information gain value [25] for gene X i is calculated as follows: where Ent ( S ) is the entropy for a set of sample S in k classes (see Eq. (2)), and Ent ( X i ,T ; S ) is the entropy for gene X i with an interval boundary T (see Eq. (3)).
 3.2. Association analysis
Association analysis is a data mining technique for discovering interesting relationships hidden in large datasets. The uncovered relationships may reveal interesting connections among attributes, which can be represented in the form of association rules or sets of frequent itemsets [36]. Such information is helpful for developing understanding and decision making in application domains. For example, in market basket analysis, association analysis is often used to identify items that are frequently purchased together. In microarray data analysis, association analysis can be used to identify groups of genes that are likely to co-occur in target samples [35]. Frequent itemset mining is one of the approaches used to find groups of genes that have related functionality. This study has proposed a new way of constructing transactional data to extract interesting associations among discriminative genes based on their biological properties (see Section 2.3).

The proposed approach allows the use of any of the association algorithms to generate frequent item-sets from the transaction database. This study has employed the FP-Growth in mining the frequent itemsets and the details of the algorithm can be found at [35]. Several decisions have been made to allow the existing association algorithm to better fit the analysis of this study. The decisions are as follows:  X  Minimum support : In this study, the minimum support is determined randomly for mining frequent  X  Maximal frequent itemsets : Due to the large amount of genes in the transaction database, this study  X  Sorting genes in an itemset : All genes in an itemset are sorted in descending order based on their  X  Itemset interestingness : Different from the conventional association algorithm that only keep tracks
Finding frequent itemsets is one of the major steps in association analysis to identify interesting sets of items. Relevant gene subsets are selected with the assumption that genes sharing similar biological properties (annotations) also work together in certain cell conditions. Since filter method is applied on earlier stage, only genes correlated with class labels will be considered when generating the frequent itemsets. 3.3. Gene ranking
A ranking mechanism is further applied to the generated frequent patterns for distinguishing the pos-sible degree of importance of genes. The ranking mechanism takes the discriminative scores for genes in an itemset and then calculates an interestingness score for that itemset. In this study, the interestingness for a frequent itemset is defined as the average value of discriminative scores for all the genes in them. The generated frequent itemsets are ranked according to their interestingness scores in descending order. The most top-ranked frequent itemsets is considered as the most informative itemset, and its representa-tive gene is considered the most informative genes. A representative gene in an itemset is the item with the highest discriminative score. Gene subsets are then generated from the representative genes of the top-ranked frequent itemsets, and only the most informative gene subset will be inputted for building the classification model. The best gene subset is the set of genes that can achieve the highest predictive accuracy with less number of genes. 3.4. Proposed gene selection algorithm
Following is the high level description of the proposed gene selection approach for ranking frequent itemsets and finding the optimal gene subset. Figure 6 depicts the algorithm for finding optimal gene subset. 1. Calculate the discriminative scores for all genes in microarray dataset. 2. Retrieve annotations for these genes. Genes without annotation will be ignored. 3. Create a transactional data with annotation as  X  X ransactions X  and genes as  X  X tems X . Gene with 4. Run association algorithm with specific minimum support to find frequent itemsets. 5. Calculate the interestingness of frequent itemsets that are averages of discriminative scores of genes 6. Rank frequent itemsets by their interestingness and the itemset with the highest values is considered 7. Find the representative gene from each frequent itemset, which is the highest discriminative score 8. Output these representative genes from m top-ranked frequent itemsets and use them as gene subset 9. Output the smallest set of representative genes corresponding to the best LOOCV. 4. Experiments
Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed gene selection method, in term of classification accuracy and number of selected genes. The aim of the proposed method is to produce the highest classification accuracy with the smallest number of informative genes.
Association analysis was implemented using the FP-Growth algorithm (FPG) [35]. For each integra-tive based model the best minimum support (minSup) was chosen for generating the maximal frequent itemsets. Then the generated frequent itemsets were ranked according to their interestingness in order to create gene subset by getting representative genes from top-ranked frequent itemsets. The selected genes subset is then used for leave-one-out cross validation classification (LOOCV).

The WEKA packages [25] were imported to run the data preprocessing and classifications. Three classifiers are used in this study, which include Na X ve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR). Two criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach are the number of selected genes (#Genes) and predictive accuracy (Acc.). This study aims to select the smallest number of genes, which can achieve the highest predictive accuracy. 4.1. Dataset and preprocessing
The proposed integrative gene selection method was tested on publicly available microarray data and additional biological information. Four cancer-related microarray datasets that contain binary classes were used in the experiments, namely colon cancer [37], leukemia [38], breast cancer [39] and lung can-cer [40] datasets. These datasets were chosen because they are mostly used in microarray data analysis for gene selection [3,12,29 X 31,41 X 43], thus they are suitable to be used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method. Table 1 shows a summary of details for the microarray datasets used in the experiments. The notation  X #Samples X  indicates the number of samples, while  X #Genes X  indicates the number of genes in the raw microarray data. The samples in microarray datasets can be classified into two classes, and the notation  X  X amples per class X  indicates the number of samples for each.
For data preprocessing, related filtering algorithms are imported from WEKA software [25]. The missing values in the datasets are replaced by the mean value of the gene and the microarray data are standardized and discretized using an entropy-based discretization method [26]. After that, the informa-tion gain (InfoGain) method is used to calculate discriminative scores for all the genes in the array. These preprocessing methods are employed because they are frequently used in microarray studies [3,12], thus allow fair comparison of classification results. Furthermore, to ensure only the differentially expressed genes will be considered in the analysis, genes with discriminative scores equal to zero are removed. By doing this, it reduces a substantial amount of genes in the datasets and proved that filter method is an effective way to shrink the dimensionality of dataset in the early stage. Table 2 shows the number of remaining genes for all the microarray datasets after filtering with information gain method. The number of genes is reduced more than 90% or at least more than half in all of the microarray datasets. On the other hand, two types of biological information, namely Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG Pathway (KEGG) were incorporated to guide the selection process of the proposed method. With the remaining genes from the filtered microarray data, additional biological knowledge was retrieved from the Gene Ontology database [20] and the KEGG Pathway database [21]. These databases contain the annotations that provide gene information at the functional level. Each annotation in the database has a unique annotation identifier (e.g. GO ID, KEGG ID) and may contain information such as name, descrip-tions and gene they annotated. The annotations can be retrieved using gene identifier (gene ID) or gene symbol as defined in the related database. Tables 3 and 4 present the summary of biological information collected from both databases. Since the genes without annotations will be ignored in the subsequent process, the number of genes is further reduces for the filtered microarray datasets. Therefore, this study has suggested another way of reducing the dimensionality by removing the non-informative genes, or in other words, genes that did not have any biological information recorded. 4.2. Results
This section presents the results obtained from the experiments conducted. The performances of the proposed integrative based models are compared with traditional expression-only models that consider purely on expression values. For expression-only models, the genes are discretized using the entropy-based discretization method [26] and ranked by their discriminative scores, which are computed with the information gain method (InfoGain) [25]. The 50 top-ranked genes and the 100 top-ranked genes are then used as comparison models.

For integrative based models, the FP-Growth algorithm (FPG) [35] was implemented to generate max-imal frequent itemsets with the best minimum support (minSup). The generated frequent itemsets are then ranked according to their interestingness in order to form the best gene subset by getting repre-sentative genes from the top-ranked frequent itemsets. The best gene subset that produced the highest leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) classification accuracy would be the best integrative model. The stopping criterion for searching the best gene subset is set to 100. Three types of integrative models are created based on the biological information they incorporated, namely the GO based models, the KEGG based models, and the GO-KEGG based models.

The classification results for the tested microarray datasets are given in Tables 5 X 8. Three classifiers are used, which include the Na X ve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression ((LR). The criteria used to evaluate the effectiveness of the models between different classifiers are the classification accuracy (Acc.) and the number of genes (#Genes). The best result would be the smallest number of genes which can achieve the highest accuracy. For each model, the average of best accuracies from all tested classifiers (Average Acc.) is used for further models comparison.

For colon cancer dataset, Table 5 shows that the proposed integrative based models outperformed the expression-only models by attaining better classification accuracies with lesser number of genes. The GO-KEGG based model achieved the highest accuracy (95.16%) in both NB and LR classifiers with 12 and 5 genes respectively. Besides that, the GO-KEGG based model achieved the highest average accu-racy (94.62%), which is approximately 6% higher compare to the average accuracy for expression-only models. This proved that integrative based models are indeed more effective than those without incor-porating additional biological information. The results show that high dimensionality in the expression-only model leads to inconsistent and poor prediction performance.

On the other hand, in the leukemia dataset, Table 6 shows that the proposed integrative based models attained better accuracies and less number of genes. For instance, both GO based and GO-KEGG based model achieved 100% classification accuracy with number of genes varied from 5 to 8. The average accuracy has increased approximately 0.46%. Although the increment is small, but the model proved to be able to achieve better or same results with just small number of genes. Besides that, the GO based model managed to attain the same accuracy values and the same number of genes for all the classifiers, which proved that the consistency of the model built with the selected genes. The KEGG based model had lower average accuracy and higher number of genes compared to the others integrative models. This explains that small size of model dimensionality will also leads to poor prediction performance, due to the model being too simple. The information gathered for the KEGG based model may be not enough to build up the classification system.

For breast cancer dataset, integrative models did not outperformed in all of the three classifiers com-pared to the expression-only method as shown in Table 7. The GO based model performed best by providing the highest accuracy 98.97% in SVM and highest average classification accuracy 96.56% compared to the other. On the other hand, the GO-KEGG based model exceeds the expression-only method in two classifiers producing the second highest average of classification accuracy 93.81%. The KEGG based method did not perform well as it produce the lowest average of accuracy 89.35% com-pared to other. The GO based model is built using minimum support 0.004 with 138 top-ranked genes. Whereas the KEGG based model is built using minimum support 0.03 with only 25 top-ranked genes. Due to small dimensionality, this may be the reason the model did not outperformed as many genes are filtered out as they are not annotated by KEGG pathways. For GO-KEGG based, the model performs moderately with 164 top-ranked genes generated from the proposed approach with minimum support is set to 0.003.

For lung cancer dataset, Table 8 shows that the proposed approach attained 100% accuracy for all the classifiers with less number of genes. The GO-KEGG based model accuracy reach 100% in NB classifier with only 7 differentially expressed genes. The GO based model in comparison need more number of genes to attain 100% accuracy, however the number of genes still less than 50. With the integrative based model the average classification accuracy has increased approximately 0.55% compare to expression-only method. Though the increment is not much, but the proposed approach is able to achieve highest and same accuracies across classifiers. The GO based model are built using minimum support 0.02 that includes top-ranked 257 genes. For the KEGG based model, 67 genes are generated with minimum support 0.04, while the best GO-KEGG based model are using minimum support 0.02 to generate 297 genes. From the figures, the NB and SVM classifiers show consistent changes of accuracy values across number of gene in the entire integrative based model. 5. Discussion
The main concern in analysing microarray data is the high-dimensionality problem. After normaliza-tion and discretization, it is necessary to filter our noisy data and a select significant set of genes for related cancer classification. This study implemented information gain method to calculate the discrim-inative scores for each gene for selecting the differentially expressed genes in the early phase. On the next phase, an association analysis technique is proposed to select informative genes for the classification system.

The experiments examined four public microarray datasets and the performance of the classifiers built using the selected genes are good enough to demonstrate that the proposed system is indeed useful and effective for gene selection and classification of cancer data. In addition, the method can easily integrate two different types of biological knowledge, such as GO and KEGG, in the same classification system. The aim of this integration is to improve gene selection process in order to provide informative clas-sification model. Table 9 illustrates the selected gene subset used to build the GO-KEGG based model in colon cancer and leukemia dataset. With the biological properties attached to each of the genes, the selected genes prove to provide valid biological insights to classes under studies. For instance, the best subset in colon cancer dataset contains only 5 genes, where both M26383 (Human monocyte-derived neutrophil-activating protein (MONAP) mRNA, complete cds) and J02854 (Myosin regulatory light chain 2, smooth muscle isoform (human); contains element TAR1 repetitive element), which are the genes involved in pathways that able to discriminate between normal and colon cancer tissues. J02854 is a muscle-related gene that reflects normal colon tissue had higher muscle content compare to colon cancer tissue [44], and M26383 is found related to several pathways in cancer such as hsa05200 and hsa05219 [21]. For leukemia dataset, 3 differentially expressed genes are selected to build the classi-fiers, where genes X95735 and M23197 are found to be relevant to leukemia cancer. X95735 possesses LIM domain that interact with leukemogenic bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) proteins, while M23197 previously been identified as a gene associated with myeloid leukemia and as  X  X oding for CDD3, a dif-ferentiation antigen of myeloid progenitor cells X  [45]. Additionally, the genes are associated with three pathway identified in KEGG pathways, which belonging to Acute myeloid leukemia pathway: hsa04640 (Hematopoietic cell lineage), hsa04630 (Jak-STAT signaling pathway), and has04110 (Cell cycle).
Table 10 shows the comparative classification performance of the proposed approach with other inte-grative approach by Qi and Tang [3], which integrate GO in their analysis. The gene selection proposed in this study outperformed the other in all cancer-related datasets, either by attaining better accuracies, or attaining the same accuracy with less number of genes.
 In this paper, the experiments conducted measured th e quality of the proposed integrative system to select discriminative and informative genes for microarray data classification. Moreover, all experiments run on cancer datasets; colon, leukemia, breast and lung cancer, which open possibility for more accu-rate cancer diagnosis in future. The experimental results showed that the proposed gene selection based on integrative approach can improve the accuracy of microarray data classification. The suggested inte-grative based models; GO based model, KEGG based model and GO-KEGG based model outperformed the expression-only models by attaining better classification accuracies with less number of genes. It can be concluded that in comparison with expression-only classification system, an integrative classification system was a more accurate system. 6. Conclusion
This paper proposed an integrative gene selection for the classification of microarray data. The aim is to integrate gene expression data with additional biological information, such as Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway annotations in a classification framework for identifying differentially expressed and informative genes. One of the reasons for suggesting this integrative approach is to improve the clas-sification accuracy by reducing the dimensionality of microarray data. Besides that, and integrative ap-proach would allowed the classification results to be more interpretable and creates new hypotheses for future investigation. According to [46], the field of gene expression data analysis has shifted from pure data-oriented methods to methods that include additional background knowledge in the domain. These methods can be termed as intelligent data analysis.

Two main techniques are implemented into the proposed integrative classification system to fulfill the objectives of this research. These two techniques are used to create a new gene selection method that can be easily incorporated into classification framework. The suggested gene selection method combines the strengths of both filter method and association analysis. The filter method ensures only discriminative genes will be considered in subsequently process and it usually removes a large number of genes at early phases. Then, association analysis technique is applied to identify interesting relationships among genes, or in other words, to groups the genes with the same biological functions. Different from clustering techniques, association mining allowed genes to be associated together in more than one group, and by doing this it also provides a solution for eliminating redundancy among genes. Only one representative gene will be considered from each group when selecting informative gene subset.

Moreover, this paper has suggests an integrative approach that is able to incorporate more than one types of biological information in the same framework. This will be a new way of exploiting different biological knowledge in the domain as most of the previous works only integrate one type of information in one selection process. Moreover, additional biological information is integrated into the gene selec-tion method itself, instead of being treated as a subsequent process to validate the selected genes. By incorporating biological information there is less possibility for the genes to be selected by chance, and the models built are more biological meaningful.

In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed system, several experiments have been con-ducted on cancer-related microarray datasets. The results showed that the proposed integrative based models produced higher classification accuracy with selected genes. It outperformed the expression-only models by attaining better classification accuracies with lesser number of genes. When compared with other integrative method [3], the proposed integrative system increases the classification accuracy approximately 16% higher and outperformed in all datasets (colon cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, and lung cancer) by attaining better classification accuracies with less number of genes. For instance, 100% accuracy is achieved in leukemia and lung cancer for all the classifiers with the number of genes as low as three. The accuracy and the number of selected genes are used to measure the performance of the classification system.

Though the proposed integrative gene selection had attained promising results, but there are some aspects that can be improved in future works. A novel association analysis approach can be proposed in future, which can be used specifically for microarray data in an integrative environment. This is because typical microarray data is a very large dataset and conventional association algorithm will have problems in generating large frequent itemsets or rules, which cause the computational time and cost to be very high. In addition to that, the gene selection solutions can be extended to generating association rules rather than just considering the frequent patterns. Apart from that, different types of biological informa-tion should be incorporated with microarray data to build more effective and informative classification models. For instance, protein-protein interactions and transcription factors can be integrated together with microarray data. However, for efficient integration only relevant biological knowledge should be considered for processing, instead of combining all types of data without filtering. Finally in future works, the integrative gene selection approach should generalisable to all kinds of microarray data and will produce reliable classification results.
