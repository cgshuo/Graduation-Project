 With the booming development of the Web, popular Chinese forums enable people to find experienced customers X  reviews for products. In order to get an all-around opinion about one product, users need to go through plenty of web pages, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Consequently, automatic review mining and summarization has become a hot research topic recently. However, previous approaches are not applicable for mining Chinese customer reviews. In this paper, we introduce SOPING, a Chinese customer review mining system that mines reviews from forums. Specifically, we propose a novel search-based approach to extract product features and a feature-oriented sentence orientation determination method. Our experimental results show that our proposed techniques are highly effective. I.2.7 [ Artificial Intelligence ]: Natural Language Processing  X  text analysis General Terms: Algorithms, Performance, Experimentation Keywords: Chinese reviews, feature extraction, search, sentiment classification, user input The rapid growth and spread of Internet has dramatically changed customers X  purchase behavior. In China, it is now common for customers to surf the Web, especially some popular forums which enable users to express their opinions on products such as http://group.zol.com.cn, to get prev ious users X  opinions about the product before they decide what or whether to buy. Generally, people prefer to get an all-around opinion about one product, so they need to click a large number of li nks in forums, which is a very time-consuming and inefficient way. In response, it is valuable to develop a system that shows previ ous users X  opinions of products in a straightforward way to help make decisions. To the best of our knowledge, previous approaches in mining customer reviews focus on mining reviews written in English. [1] proposed an automated system relying on the identification of sets of terms of frequent co-occurrence and a WordNet-based method to predict the orientations of sent ences. While their approach is successful in terms of precision and recall by applying compactness pruning and redundancy pruning, the number of features discovered can be unmanageable. [2] reduced th e redundancy of features in [1] by using similarity matching a nd including user-specific prior knowledge. However, in addressing the issue in Chinese, compactness and redundancy pruning do not work because features are usually single words. The Wo rdNet-based method for predicting the orientations of sentences is also not applicable to Chinese as WordNet is for English only. In this paper, we introduce SOPING, a Chinese customer review mining system. We propose associ ation mining and a novel search-based method to extract features from Chinese customer reviews. We employ a Chinese opinion word s dictionary based method to do feature-oriented sentence orientation determination, propose an interactive user-guided revision process to update the Chinese opinion words dictionary to make SOPING evolvable. SOPING contains 5 steps: 1) Chinese customer review sentences crawling, 2) word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging with ICTCLAS (http://www.nlp.org.cn), 3) product feature extracting, 4) feature-oriented opinion sentences X  orientation predicting, and 5) summarization. Step 3 and 4 are the most important steps. Because of the limitation of space, we focus on step 3 and 4 here. This step identifies product features on which many people have expressed their opinions. We firs t use association mining to find frequent itemsets as [1]. In our context, an itemset is simply a Chinese noun that appears in cu stomer review sentences. The generated frequent itemsets are called raw features in this paper. However, not all frequent features generated are genuine features. For example, finger , thing (all the features mentioned in this paper are translated from Chinese), are not product features. With the flourish of some famous commercial search engines, such as Google, Baidu, it brings alternativ es to solve some originally hard problems. Therefore, in our paper, we resort to commercial search engines to filter unrelated raw features . A good commercial search engine will return results that are most relevant to a query. If a query is a daily expression, the top ranking results will contain the whole query in their titles or snippets. Therefore, we can determine whether an expression is a daily one or not according to the presence of the expression in top ranking results. In Chinese grammar, it is common to combine a  X  X roduct cat egory name X  with a  X  X roduct feature X  (genuine feature) to form a daily expression, while it is not the case with a non-genuine raw feature . When we issue a query combining  X  X roduct category name X  with a raw feature to www.baidu.com (the leading search e ngine in China), we consider a raw feature to be a genuine one if at least one of the top ranking results contains the query. Following is an example illustration of our search-based method. We mine features of Nokia N73, whose category is mobile . Suppose we have two raw features : software and thing . First we issue  X  mobilesoftware  X  to Baidu, and find it top two results do not contain it. So we filter  X  thing  X  from raw features . In this paper, we propose a Chin ese opinion words dictionary based method to predict the orientations of opinion sentences for features in them and use an interactive us er-guided revision process to make SOPING evolvable. We have three Chinese opinion words dictionaries: positive, negative a nd negation words dictionary. The original data of the first two dic tionaries are from [3]. The detailed procedure of predicting the orientations of opinion sentences for features in them is described in Figure 1.
 Procedure SentenceOrientation is similar to [1]. But we think one sentence can express different orient ations for features in it. For instance, this mobile X  X  software is usable, but its system is not stable (translated from Chinese). It shows positive opinion for feature software but negative opinion for feature system . We use the nearest opinion word after one feature to determine the orientation of this sentence for this feature if number of positive opinion words equals to number of negative words (line 10 to 13). The important procedure for predicting the orientation of an opinion word wordOrientation is described in Figure 2.
 In procedure wordOrientation , because the number of words in our dictionaries is limited, we out put undetermined opinion words (we consider adjectives as opinion words) and use an interactive user-guided revision process to judge th e orientations of words then adding to dictionaries. Through this way our dictionaries can be updated continuously and thus SOPING is evolvable. We conducted experiment s using the Chinese customer reviews of two electronic products: one mob ile and one MP3. We randomly crawled 224 Chinese review senten ces for mobile and 108 sentences for MP3. All reviews were craw led from http://group.zol.com.cn. For evaluation, we manually identify features in sentences and judge the orientations of sentences according to each feature in them separately. Table 1 shows results of extracted product features. Dep 0 in both products is baseline method instead of search-based method. 
Table 1: Recall, precision and F-score of mobile and MP3. Dep means number of returned results of search engine we checked in step 3. Num m means number of manual features. Num r means In Table 1 we list the best and worst results after applying our search-based method for each product. We use 0.01 as minimum-support in association mining. We also tried 0.005 but find the result is as good as 0.01 because of the limitation of POS tagger. From the results we can see our method can bring significant improvement to F-score, which is quite encouraging. Table 2 shows results of predicti ng orientations of sentences for features in them using the best results generated from step 3 for products. orientation predicting. Num-t me ans total number of sentences The exciting results of precision prove our method of predicting opinion sentences X  orientations for f eatures in them quite effective. This paper introduces a Chinese customer review mining system SOPING. Specifically, we propose a novel search-based approach to extract product features and a feature-oriented sentence orientation determination method. Our prelim inary experiments on these two proposed approaches show promisi ng results. Our future work will focus on improving the precision of subjective sentence extraction and product feature identification.
