 1. Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been successfully used to automatically extract information from and highlighting misconceptions. Concept maps provide a useful medium for sharing such information in a concise and accessible form, making knowledge models based on concept maps a promising vehicle for knowledge sharing. cept Mapping (FACM) framework which aims at extracting concept maps from natural language short texts based on NLP documents can be provided in a more effective and efficient way. 2. Concept map
Concept maps were developed in 1972 in the course of Novak X  X  research program at Cornell where he sought to follow strategies ( Okebukola, 1992 ).

 that can be applied reliably due to the occurrence of ambiguous words and ambiguous sentences structures. tinually improved. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm produces concepts and relationships based on multi-word text the suggestions while they are completing the concept map. 4. Methodology for Fuzzy Association Concept Mapping (FACM) parsing stage, interjections, list item markers, and short sentences are filtered out. 4.1.

The similarity is determined as follows: where m is the number of inputs, w j is the weighting of the j th POS, v o that of the retrieved cases, sim  X  v o j ; v r j  X  is the similarity function for the j th POS as follows: separated by commas and semicolons to form the concept X  X ink X  X oncept propositions. ordered according to their importance and relevance to anaphoric resolution.

 lowing equation: where F ij n is the normalized frequency of concept i and concept j co-existing in the same or adjacent sentence, N ber of count of concept i and concept j co-existing in the same or adjacent sentence, N among all concepts co-existing in the same or adjacent sentence.

The fuzzy values of the normalized frequencies are determined according to the corresponding membership function. A tionship between concepts is shown in Fig. 5 . The COG of fuzzy set A on the interval a given by the following equation: descending weighting of the relationships, CG ( A ).

Conclusion and future work concept map generation is proposed which works well on multi words and is suitable for highlighting rare phenomena from scientific and short texts such as abstract databases, news groups, emails, discussion forums, etc. structing a high-quality concept map.
