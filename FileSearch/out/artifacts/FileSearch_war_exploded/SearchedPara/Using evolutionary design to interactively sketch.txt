 1. Introduction
The art of sketching, and the sket ches themselves, are considered to be an important part of conceptual design as well as the way for designers to condense their knowledge and exploration ( R  X  omer ( Yang and Cham, 2007 ; Yang, 2003 ) address the correlation between the quantity of generated sketches and their impact on design outcomes. Moreover, they explore the relationship between the moment of sketching in the design process, especially early in the design, and the impact on the outcomes. Based on the correlation concept generation is significantl ycorrelatedwithprojectoutcome 2009 ) found that early sketching and prototyping gave the best project outcome qualities. Moreover, some studies focus on the importance of the prototyping stage. Yang ( Yang, 2004 ) explores the influence of the prototype comple xity, prototype quantity and the time spent on this activity and their relationship with the design outcome. The results of the study show that the lesser number of parts in a device, then the greater the project outcome quality.
Evolutionary Computation (EC) has become a major approach for the exploration and evaluation of design solutions, and especially 2D sketched solutions. An EC method basically uses dimensions and structures of the design object are directly represented in the genome (see for example ( Kelly et al., 2008 )).
For example, when designing a bottle ( Ang et al., 2006 ; Kelly propose an IGA based on the encoding of the car silhouette genes after a Fourier decomposition. In Section 2 , we provide some arguments to compare this GA modeling technique with para-meterized curves and shape grammar approaches. Next, the
Interactive GA (IGA) is presented and the crossing-over operation between genes detailed. The interactivity consists in allowing a style designer to qualitatively assess individuals at each genera-tion. As such, new innovative designs are expected to emerge through a balanced collaboration between an automatic design space exploration process and the interaction of a designer. In
Section 3 , we propose a method to identify an index of a perceived similarity between two car profiles. In Section 4 ,we use this index through a series of user tests to prove that innovation and surprise may emerge from this process in an effective way. Section 5 concludes on the properties of the IGA approach for innovative sketching. 2. Model description 2.1. Quality of an encoding model
In this work, we have decided to approximate the visual perception of a car through a 2D  X  X  X ide-view X  X  closed curve. Math-ematically, we define m , the set of closed curves in R 2 the quotient set m \ R where R is the following equivalence relation:  X  X  X wo curves of m are equivalent with respect to R , if and only if, they are similar through rotations, homotheties and translations X  X .
Numerically, an equivalence class can be described in different ways (resampled curve, Fourier spectrum, wavelet coefficients
The book of Mallat ( Mallat, 1999 ) discusses these different modeling techniques thoroughly. These are different surrogate representations for a same object, each of which have their advantages and disadvantages.

Considering their ability to be appropriate to encode closed curves for an evolutionary design purpose, three properties must be characterized:
Ability to avoid the emergence of  X  X  X egenerated individuals X  X  (aberrations are likely to be invisible for frequential represen-tation) (improving  X  X  X onsistency X  X ).
 The ability to define a convenient cross-over mechanism. The ability to define a convenient mutation mechanism. 2.2. Fourier harmonics to encode car silhouettes
McGarva ( McGarva and Mullineux, 1993 ) has proposed a method for coding the phenotype of 2D-closed-curves using their development into a Fourier series. Personally, we have already used this theory in ( Vasiliu and Yannou, 2001 ) for encoding a 2D-closed-curve into the five first Fourier harmonics of this decomposition.

The McGarva X  X  theory of Fourier decomposition of a closed curve ( McGarva and Mullineux, 1993 ) considers that the position of each point belonging to this curve can be expressed by a complex function in the complex plane, as written in formula (1): z  X  t  X  X  x  X  t  X  X  iy  X  t  X  X  1  X 
As the curve is closed, z ( t ) is a periodic function. The period is series in formula (2). z  X  t  X  X  where the complex Fourier coefficients can be calculated by formula (3). a  X 
Coefficient a 0 is called the fundamental, a 1 and a 1 represent the first harmonic, a 2 and a 2 the second harmonic, etc.
As we will see later, the function z ( t ) is not known as an explicit function from the beginning. Instead, we assume that the curve has been initially defined by a set of successive points z a coefficients (3) a numeric approximation is required. This approximation is obtained by dividing the curve into N segments connecting each point with its successor. We call t k the length of the curve between the first point z 0 and the point z k . Under these conditions the integral can be calculated by the trapezium formula: a  X  where z is a periodic function, ( z N  X  1  X  z 0 ).

The value of t k is the ratio of the length of the curve to point k and the total length of the curve (see formula (5)). t  X  L , L  X  oscillations when trying to reconstruct the curve with (6) (see
Table 2 ). That is why we increase the number of points by smooth interpolations, using bicubic splines linking three successive points (see Fig. 8 ). Thereby we finally obtain a number of points N describing the silhouette by a smooth curve where N 4 M .
A good encoding quality is reached if the phenotype obtained after the encoding X  X ecoding process is visually similar to the initial between the number N of points on the curve used for coding and the number p of the harmonics used when decoding the genome into a curve. Indeed, the higher the number of harmonics used for decoding the more precise the approximation to the original curve.
On the other hand, the number N of points on the curve used for coding the genome has an influence on the precision of the Fourier coefficients. A simple full factorial design of experiments (see
Table 2 ) has been performed to identify the best compromise between N and p . The evaluation of the fidelity level of the complete encoding X  X ecoding process has been qualitatively-visually-per-formed by us on a 5-level scale {I  X  inaccurate, O  X  oscillations,
SO  X  strong oscillations, G  X  good result, GG  X  very good result}. In definitive, we found that a satisfactory choice was achieved with a genome size of 71 and a number N of approximately 1500 points for the interpolation since both initial and resulting silhouettes were visually identical.

A last normalization operation is required for the genomes so that the phenotypes  X  silhouettes  X  are independent of a particu-lar location, size or rotation and are only compared in terms of their shape, as discussed at the beginning of this paper. et al., 2008 ). The individuals can reproduce among themselves and in this way, produce new solutions.

Our IGA is built upon four operators that influence the evolution of generations:
Selection : decides which individuals will reproduce and create children.
 Crossover : builds a child X  X  genome from two parent genomes.
Mutation : changes a genome in a random way after the crossover.

Killing : decides which individuals from the parents X  population will survive in the new generation.

The selection and killing operators depend on the fitness values assigned by the user to each individual, i.e. to each car silhouette representing a design solution. The fitness value f is a number between 0 and 6 according to the grade given by the user via an interface showing six individuals at the same time. The user browses through individuals from a generation and gives them a fitness value corresponding to his objective, where 0 is the worst and 6 is the best (see Fig. 9 ).

We decided to adopt some conventional choices in term of selection and killing operators and to propose an original cross-over operator. First, apart from the initial population of 30 individuals, we have fixed the number of individuals at 100 for each generation. We have chosen a turnover rate of 0.7, meaning that, for a coming generation, 30 individuals are kept from the previous one and 70 children are generated. In this way, poten-tially good design solutions are not lost. The probability for an individual to be selected as a parent is proportional to its fitness value (between 0 and 6). After two individuals are chosen from the parents X  population, their genomes are combined into a child X  X  genome by applying the crossover and mutation operators. After-wards, the two individuals are put back into the parents X  popula-tion. Indeed, the selection operator can select an individual more than once Fig. 10 .

The crossover operator consists in a weighted average between the gene values of the two parents to build the genome of the child. A crossover weight W is chosen randomly between 0 and 100. A new gene g * is formed by calculating the weighted average of the genes g m, 1 and g m, 2 of the parents using the following formula:  X 
Finally, the killing operator is applied to the original popula-individuals are considered to be totally useless or totally unsa-tisfactory and shall no longer contribute to the evolution of the population. All other individuals have a chance of survival.
The individuals to be killed are chosen by an inverse roulette wheel method. This means that the probability pk i for an individual to be killed can be expressed by: pk where f i is the fitness of the individual i and N * is the number of individuals in the population who have not been evaluated with a fitness of 0. 3. Similarity index: a validation tool
Is our system really capable of producing both innovation and novelty? With the help of our system, is it possible for a user to design a new car body silhouette which was not part of the initial population?
To answer these questions, it may be useful to have a tool that automatically measures the perceived difference between two car silhouettes and to prove whether the two car silhouettes are similar or not. We have then proposed to create a similarity index.
Built upon user assessments, it measures the distance between two car profiles. The similarity index is an essential point in this study to perform tests and prove the relevance of the present evolutionary design framework to inspire designers. Two impor-tant criteria for the design of the index can be quoted: It must be mathematically founded.
 The calibration process must be stable and user-friendly.
The objectiveness issue is not a basic criterion; each designer can have his/her own conception of distance but it must, in all cases remain consistent from one assessment to another, when assessed by the same user (this is what we mean by the stability of the calibration process).

Hereafter, we propose a description of the process to obtain this similarity index. Two different models have been tested. 3.1. Mathematical definition
We first define D ( k,l ), the distance between two genomes G and G l . Since modifications on the first ten genes only are significant (modifications on other genes do not change anything on the visual perception of the car profile), we hypothesize that the distance between two genomes D ( k,l ) may be expressed as a weighted sum of the elementary distances between the first ten genes by the following formula.
 D  X  k , l  X  X 
The factors a  X  m  X  are weighting factors that must give more importance to some genes in accordance with their participation in the apparent modification of the silhouettes. Here g k,m number m from genome k and g l,m is gene number m from genome l . One gene consists of two harmonics, called a m a m , which are complex numbers. They can be written as: a  X  u m  X  iv m .

By performing these tests n times with different car profiles, different users, and different i and j values, we get n different b values. The final value of b adopted is the average.

The next step consists in measuring a . We propose the following process: for each of the previous comparisons (between
G 0, G 1 and G 2), the user defines the level of similarity x % ( X  X  X he similarity between G 0and G 1ontheonehandand G 0and G 2onthe other hand is 70% X  X  for example). To simplify the designer X  X  evalua-tion task, the designer is asked to provide a similarity judgment on a 7-level scale which is converted into the percentage value as shown in Table 3 .

The relation linking x % and a is given by x %  X  100 where b is the average value of the previous tests and a is finally obtained by a  X  1
We also obtain 2 n different values of a . The average value is acceptable if the standard deviation is low. The calculation of the similarity index is now completed.

Practically, we use a Java interface (see Fig. 12 ) that follows the processes described above through a series of random trials on individuals from the initial populations and with i and j values. 3.3. Weighted form
In the previous section, we assumed that a  X  m  X  should give more importance to the first genes than the last ones and can be written as an exponential expression. Let us ignore this assump-tion and try to associate each a  X  m  X  to a given weight p if this assumption easily seems true for the 3 or 4 first genes, it may be wrong for the next ones as it visually becomes harder to rank the influence of a modification on the (for instance) 5th or 6th harmonics.
 So D ( k,l ) is expressed by D  X  k , l  X  X 
To obtain the weights values, we follow the same process as with the exponential form. We finally obtain expressions linking weights p i and p j as p  X  : g 0 j g 2 j : 2 : g 0 i g 1 i : 2
By performing this test n times ( n 4 10 ) with different values for i and j (to cover all of the first ten genes), we have a system of n equations, that can easily be resolved with the logarithmic least square method.
 in the first case we obtained a MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 4.51, which shows a good precision for the model compared to the evaluation scale (0 X 100%). As such, the exponential form has been chosen for the similarity index. It has then been used to validate our model thanks to several user tests presented in the next section. 4. Model validation Several tests have been performed to validate the model.
We propose a short synthesis of some of these tests before detailing the ones that particularly prove that this evolutionary design schema stimulates creativity. 4.1. Synthesis of the validation tests
These first tests are presented in more detail in ( Cluzel et al., 2010 ) and ( Cluzel and Yannou, 2009 ). In this section, we only draw the main conclusions and findings concerning user satisfac-tion and the convergence of the model. The next section details three tests that mainly focus on creativity. 4.1.1. User satisfaction
The first way to validate the model consists in observing the evolution of user satisfaction along the generations. A test inspired by ( Kim and Cho, 2000 ) has been performed by asking 8 users to evaluate 10 successive generations. These users are students in the design engineering field in the last year of master class. 4 users were asked to find their best sportive car profile, while the 4 other users worked with the friendly semantic attribute (find their best friendly car silhouette). We asked the users to perform hedonistic assessments (i.e. including their own preference). The mutation probability and the selection rate were respectively set to 0.05 and 0.7.

The average fitness values evolution on the 10 generations (see Fig. 14 ) proves that the users are satisfied by the model.
Indeed, the average user fitness increases from 2.3 to 3.9 for the semantic attribute sportive, and from 3.0 to 5.0 for the friendly attribute, i.e. an increase of about 70% in the two cases. 4.1.2. Convergence
To assess the ability of the model to converge, two tests based on the data obtained with the previous 8 users and the similarity index have been proposed. They aim to study the evolution along the first ten generations of the average similarity between individuals for each user (for the first test) and between the users (for the second one). In addition, we study the similarities that exist between the best individuals from the last generation for each designer.

How can we be sure that the IGA obtains better results compared to a more classical (manual) method? In other words, what is the real added value of the IGA?
In the next sections, new tests are proposed that mainly focus on novelty emergence and creativity enhancing, which are essen-tial aspects for innovation. 4.2. Novelty emergence
A major element to enhance creativity is the model X  X  ability to create novelty, i.e create any individual, randomly chosen or imagined by the user. In other words, the purpose of this test is to show that it is possible to reach a defined individual which is not part of the initial population.
 To answer this question, we can execute a simple test.
A subject draws a car body silho uette on a sheet of paper which comes spontaneously to his or her mind and which is not part of the initial population. This car body silhouette is taken as a  X  X  X arget individual X  X . Using our proposed IGA, the user must now try to obtain there is no limit to our system to converge towards the imagined user evaluates the car contour individuals, providing higher grades to contours which are similar to the ta rget contour and lower grades to those that are dissimilar. By considering both the number of genera-tions required to resemble the target individual and the similarity value, we can estimate the qu ality of our design system.
Alternatively, the target car silhouette may be an individual from the initial population which is rem oved from this initial population.
We have preferred to make abstraction of the designer sub-jectivity by automating the ability of the system to converge towards an ideal car silhouette, in order to measure the sole quality of the method. The role of the designer is played by a similarity fitness calculation algorithm, which automatically evaluates individuals from a generation in terms of their similar-ity to the target individual, thanks to the similarity index previously defined.

This test has been repeated several times, with different target individuals extracted from the initial individual population for an average final similarity index of 90%. Let us provide a practical example with the target individual given in Fig. 17 a. The genetic consequence of a choice (voluntary or not), and not a constraint of the model.

Finally, the results of these two tests show that the final individual is genetically very similar to the target individual. The
IGA is then able to create totally new individuals that are not part of the initial population. For us, this is a necessary condition to improve creativity. However, further tests are required to show that our model brings added value compared to a classical  X  X  X anual X  X  method. 4.3. Creativity enhancing
To show that the results obtained with the IGA are better than without the IGA, we have performed two different tests from a same base inspired by Kim and Cho X  X  works ( Kim and Cho, 2000 ).
The same set of data as used for some of the previous tests was used (8 users during 10 generations, with 2 semantic attributes).
However, we also asked the user to evaluate 400 randomly generated individuals with the same fitness scale (between 0 and 6). These individuals were printed on a large sheet of paper and numbered. An Excel routine was given to the users to identify, in several evaluation steps, their three preferred profiles according to their assigned semantic attribute ( X  X  X riendly X  X  or  X  X  X portive X  X ). To clarify the explanations in the rest of the docu-ment, these best individuals are called paper individuals .
The users were then asked to compare the three best paper individuals with the three best individuals from the 10th genera-tion of the IGA, thanks to a pairwise comparison matrix given in Fig. 19 . The comparisons were performed according to the scale presented in Table 5 . As such, users filled the matrix with the mathematical symbols ( 4 , b ,  X  y ) that were then replaced by numbers to analyze the data.

Considering this data, the first test evaluates the user satisfac-tion of results obtained with the IGA. The second test analyses the data with the similarity index.

Table 6 shows the test results for each user and for each semantic attribute.

Some details have to be explained to understand the meaning of Table 6 . Pairwise comparisons are made in accordance with the following scheme; the best individuals from the IGA are com-pared to the best paper individuals. For example, User 4 has an average evaluation of  X  1.00. According to Table 5 , this means that User 4 found the best individuals from the IGA slightly individuals from the 5. Concluding remarks
Shah et al. Shah et al. (2003) proposed four separate measures to assess the effectiveness of a generation process towards innovation:
Novelty, which is a measure of how unusual or unexpected a concept is, as compared to other concepts.
 Variety measures the size of the solution space.

Quality explores the feasibility of a concept and how close it comes to meet the design specifications.
 Quantity concerns the total number of concepts generated.
Transposed to this study, these measures allow the creativity enhancing of the proposed IGA model to be highlighted.
We have shown that the model is able to create individuals that are not closely linked with individuals from the initial population. The model reaches a high level of novelty potential.
Concerning variety, the size of the solution space is theoreti-cally unlimited since continuous genes are used.

Here, the quality measure can be related to the user satisfac-tion of the end-result of the design activity. Here, the superiority of designs generated by the IGA has been proved compared to a brute systematic exploration of shapes.

Finally, the quantity can be totally customized by the user: he/she chooses the size of the population, as well as the sensi-bility of the algorithm (killing and mutation factors). The choice of precise semantic attributes is a guide to generate different car profile concepts.

In addition, our model is extensible as defined by Gruber ( Gruber, 1995 ), since a designer may introduce, at any moment of the evolutionary algorithm, a customized profile he or she has just sketched, or that he/she locally modifies from an existing individual of the current generation. This facility has not been detailed here but completes the numerous advantages to further study Interactive Genetic Algorithms to explore spaces of 2D innovative curves.
