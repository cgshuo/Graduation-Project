 Personal expertise or interests often evolve over time. De-spite much work on expertise retrieval in the recent years, very little work has studied the dynamics of personal ex-pertise. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to characterize how people change or stick with their exper-tise. Specifically, three factors are taken into consideration in whether an expert will choose a new expertise area: 1) the personality of the expert in exploring new areas; 2) the similarity between the new area and the expert X  X  current ar-eas; 3) the popularity of the new area. These three factors are integrated into a unified generative process. A predic-tive language model is derived to estimate the distribution of the expert X  X  words in her future publications. In addition, KL divergence is defined on the predictive language model to quantify and forecast the change of expertise. We con-duct the experiments on a testbed of academic publications and the initial results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Expertise retrieval; Expertise profiling; Temporal change People often change their expertise or interests over time. Capturing how personal expertise evolves can better char-acterize expert profiles and thus facilitate the task of ex-pertise retrieval which is an important field in Information retrieval [2]. Various factors can affect the dynamics of per-sonal expertise. For example, new and emerging technolo-gies may make the existing ones obsolete and consequently people have to adapt their skills and expertise. Moreover, some people may have worked on the similar fields and thus they may be more likely to move to the new area than oth-ers who do not have prior background. On the other hand, the change of expertise is highly personal. Some people may always explore new areas and skills regardless of their prior areas while some other people may stay with the same ex-pertise all the time.
 We focus on modeling the dynamics of personal expertise. The task is closely related to expertise retrieval which has been extensively studied in the IR community. However, there exists very little work on investigating the dynamic aspect of expertise. Furthermore, to the best of our knowl-edge, the existing literature contains no study on predicting personal expertise. In this paper, we propose a probabilis-tic model to characterize how people change or stick with their expertise. Three factors are taken into consideration: personality, similarity, and popularity. The proposed model can be used to predict what are the next expertise areas a given expert will work on, what words the expert is likely to use in her next paper, and whether there will be a big change in her expertise areas. We conduct the experiments on a testbed of academic publications and the initial results demonstrate that our proposed model can achieve much im-proved predictive performance over the baselines.
The existing work on expert profiling has largely focused on finding and ranking topics for a given expert [1, 3, 8]. Very little work in the literature has investigated the tem-poral and dynamic aspects of expertise. Daud [4] proposed a topic modeling approach called Temporal-Author-Topic (TAT) to simultaneously model text, researchers and time of research papers, but their focus was on discovering topi-cally related researchers for different time periods. Hoonlor [5] investigated the overall trends in computer science re-search without zooming in the individual researchers. To the best of our knowledge, the closest work to ours is the recent work by Rybak et al. [7]. They studied the temporal expertise profiling task by proposing hierarchical expertise profiles in which topical areas were organized in a taxon-omy. They further detected changes in a person X  X  profile based on snapshots of hierarchical profiles taken at various time intervals. Our work differs from theirs in a number of important ways. We explicitly model the factors that affect the change of expertise. The analysis and diagnosis of these factors can help us gain a better understanding of expertise dynamics. Consequently, the proposed model can predict the new topical areas the experts are likely to work on.
In th is paper, we introduce the proposed model in the context of academic publications for the sake of presenta-tion convenience, but the model can be easily adapted to other expert profiling scenarios. In this setting, researchers are experts, and their publications indicate their expertise. In the experiments, we use the Keywords in the publica-tions to define the authors X  topical expertise areas. All the publications associated with a given area define the area.
To understand the dynamics of personal expertise, we need to look at how an expert X  X  areas evolve over time. We make the Markov assumption by assuming the expert X  X  ex-pertise areas in year t +1, denoted by a t +1 , only depends on her areas in year t , denoted by a t , not depends on the years prior to t . This is a reasonable assumption made by many temporal probabilistic models. Therefore, based on the sum rule and product rule of probabilities, the probability that the expert e will work on the area a t +1 in year t +1, denoted by P ( a t +1 | e ), is where P ( a t | e ) is the probability that expert e  X  X  current area will work on the area a t +1 given her current area a t . The estimation of P ( a t | e ) can be based on the relative frequency of a t in the expert X  X  publications in year t . Specifically, occurs in e  X  X  publications in year t , and N e,t is the total num-ber of times that any topical area occurs in e  X  X  publications in t .

The estimation of P ( a t +1 | a t , e ) is the central component of the proposed model which characterizes how the expert e chooses the next area a t +1 given the current one a t . As discussed in Section 1, we consider three factors to estimate P ( a t +1 | a t , e ): 1) the personality of the expert in exploring a new area (or the conservativeness to stay in the current areas); 2) the similarity between the new area and the ex-pert X  X  current areas; 3) the popularity of the new area. The subsections below present the modeling of individual factors in detail.
We can model how the expert e chooses the next area a t +1 given the current a t as the following generative process. 1. Choose to stay in the current expertise area set A t 2. Choose to change to the new area set  X  A t with the prob-
The above generative process can also be viewed as a two-class mixture model. Thus, P ( a t +1 | a t , e ) can be decomposed as P ( a t +1 | a t , e ) = P ( a t +1  X  A t | a t , e ) P ( a where P ( a t +1  X  A t | a t , e ) is used to model the conservative-ness of an expert, i.e., the tendency to stick with the current areas. We can look at how frequently the expert changes her areas in the previous years to estimate it, specifically as fol-lows P ( a t +1  X  A t | a t , e ) = wher e J ( A t , A t  X  1 ) measures the Jaccard similarity between two sets A t and A t  X  1 . The intuition is that if the expert is conservative, her current area set A t and the previous area set A t  X  1 will have a big overlap which leads to a high Jaccard similarity. By definition, the Jaccard similarity is always between 0 and 1. We use the average Jaccard similarity over T years to estimate P ( a t +1  X  A t | a t , e ). Consequently, the probability that e will choose a different area in year t + 1 is simply
Let us then consider the specific area the expert will choose in year t + 1 given the two different cases. If e stays in the current areas, i.e., a t +1  X  A t , the probability that she will select a t +1 may be proportional to the frequency of a t +1 e  X  X  current publications. Specifically, wh ere N a t +1 ,e,t is the frequency of the area a t +1 occurring in e  X  X  publications in year t . N e,t is the total number of times that any topical area occurs in e  X  X  publications in t .
If e chooses a new area, i.e., a t +1  X   X  A t , we will consider the similarity between the new area and the current area, and the popularity of the new area. Specifically, where Sim ( a t +1 , a t ) measures the similarity between two ar-eas a t +1 and a t . The intuition is based on the fact that if a t +1 is more similar with the expert X  X  current area a t , she is more likely to explore the area a t +1 . P op ( a t +1 sures the popularity of a t +1 . The idea is that if an exper-tise area gets popular or trendy, people are likely to move to the area regardless of their prior background (e.g., a Both Sim ( a t +1 , a t ) and P op ( a t +1 ) are normalized probabil-ities and can be calculated as follows.  X  is a parameter to trade off between the two probabilities and can be estimated by cross validation. In the experiments, we choose  X  = 0 . 5 by treating the two factors equally.
 w here cosine ( a t +1 , a t ) calculates the cosine similarity be-tween the two areas. In the experiments, we aggregate all the abstracts that co-occur with each area into one doc-ument. Thus, to estimate the similarity between two ar-eas, we can compute the cosine similarity between the two documents associated with the two areas. The popularity P op ( a t +1 ) of area a t +1 is c alculated based on the relative frequency of the area appearing in year t .
In the previous subsections, we obtain the predicted prob-ability P ( a t +1 | e ) for e over topical areas a t +1 (in year t +1). Based on it, we can further estimate e  X  X  probability over words in t + 1 as follows where P ( w t +1 | a t +1 ) is the probability over words given the topic a t +1 . Here we have conditional independence assump-tion of w t +1 and e given a t +1 . This can be viewed as a gen-erative process in which expert chooses a topic a t +1 with probability P ( a t +1 | e ) and then generates a word w t +1 the topic a t +1 with probability P ( w t +1 | a t +1 ). We can use P ( w t +1 | e ) to predict what are the next words the expert e is likely to use, and thus the above equation defines a predictive language model (PLM) for e . This model is especially useful when the topical areas are not directly observed. For exam-ple, in the experiments we use the Keywords in ACM X  X  pub-lications to identify experts X  topical areas, but many papers do not include the Keywords. e.g., those not published by ACM. Therefore, we evaluate the proposed approach based on the observed words w t +1 instead of the areas a t +1 . We can still estimate P ( a t +1 | e ) via Eqn. 1 by using the observed areas/keywords of the expert.
Based on the predictive language model P ( w t +1 | e ) in Sec-tion 3.3, we can predict to what extent the expert will change her areas for the next year. Specifically, we can achieve this by quantifying the difference between P ( w t +1 | e ) and P ( w t | e ) using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence [6] as fol-lows KL ( P t +1 ( w | e ) || P t ( w | e )) = X w here P t +1 ( w | e ) = P ( w t +1 | e ) is the predictive language model for year t + 1, and P t ( w | e ) = P ( w t | e ) is the cur-rent language model estimated based on the observed words in year t . KL divergence is a natural and well studied  X  X is-tance X  measure between two distributions. We can utilize it to detect and forecast potential changes in expertise, which could improve expertise retrieval and better understand the dynamics of expertise.
We created a testbed of expert profiles in the IR academic community. Specifically, we retrieved 500 researchers on X  X n-academic researcher website. From ArnetMiner, we could collect the titles, venues, and years of the publications as-sociated with the researchers. Totally, we obtained 25,255 paper titles. Instead of using the full-text publications, we utilized the abstracts of publications as expertise evidence of q=information$0020retrieval the authors since abstracts are concise summaries of the pub-Each paper published by ACM also includes a set of key-words that authors use to specify the topics of the paper. We treated these keywords as the topical areas of the au-thors, and all the abstracts co-occurring with a given key-word were aggregated to define the topical area/keyword. We obtained the keywords of the papers from from ACM extracted for our dataset. Although ACM publications also include Categories and Subject Descriptors devised by ACM Computing Classification System (ACC), we think they may be too coarse and sometimes cannot accurately reflect au-thors X  specific expertise.

We use the data in year t for training and the data in year t + 1 for testing. In training, only the papers with any key-words observed are used, while all the papers (in year t + 1) are used in testing. Except in Section 4.2, the time interval between t and t + 1 is assumed to be 1 year. In Section 4.2, we vary the time interval from 1 year up to 5 years to investigate how the time interval affects the model perfor-mance (e.g., the 3-year interval means using year 2008, 2009, and 2010 for training, and 2011, 2012, and 2013 for testing). We use Lucene 4.3 for indexing with EnglishAnalyzer , and a standard list of the stop words are removed and Porter stemming is applied.
In this experiment, we use perplexity as the evaluation metric for our proposed predictive language model (PLM) and baseline methods. Perplexity is a quantitative measure for comparing language models. The value of perplexity re-flects the ability of a language model to generalize to unseen data. A lower perplexity score indicates better predictive performance. We calculate the average perplexity across all the researchers as follows: perplexity ( D t +1 ) = wh ere w t +1 ,e denotes a word observed in e  X  X  publications in t +1, and D t +1 ,e is the set that includes all such words for e . D t +1 is the union set that includes D t +1 ,e for all the experts. N e is the total number of experts of interest. P ( w t +1 ,e the language model to be evaluated. For the words only ap-pearing in the test set D t +1 but not in the training data, the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, we assign them the proba-corpus.

We compare our PLM model with three baselines with dif-ferent ways to estimate P ( a t +1 | e ). Base 1 does not consider any change in research areas from a t to a t +1 , and thus as-sumes P base 1 ( a t +1 | e ) = P ( a t | e ) where P ( a frequency of a t (or a t +1 ) in e  X  X  publications in year t . Base 2 assumes the probability of choosing a t +1 is proportional to the similarity between a t and a t +1 , i.e., P base 2 P a t sim ( a t +1 , a t ) P ( a t | e ) where sim is calculated as Eqn. (2). Base 3 only considers the popularity of the area and has P base 3 ( a t +1 | e ) = P op ( a t +1 ) where P op ( a in Eqn. (3). Table 1 shows the perplexity results for the Table 1: Perplexities for the baselines and our pro-pose d model (PLM) over various time intervals. baselines and our proposed model (PLM) over various time inter vals.

From the results, we can see that our proposed PLM model has substantial improvement over the baselines across all the time intervals. The baseline methods yield similar performance with each other. All the models obtain the best results on the 2-year time interval, which may indicate researchers may often shift their research interests every two years.
In this section, we apply the proposed model in Eqn. 1 to calculate the probability P ( a t +1 | e ) that e will choose area a t +1 in year 2013. Based on the descending order of this probability, we can predict the top areas for e in 2013. Ta-ble 2 lists the top 3 areas for three researchers, along with the researchers X  top areas in 2012 calculated based on the frequency of the areas in theirs publications. Again, the areas are extracted and defined by the keywords in ACM publications (see Section 4.1).

From the results, we can see that the proposed model can predict different top areas for 2013 from 2012, while still reserving the areas of strength of the researchers. For example, Dawei Song X  X  top areas in 2012 did not include  X  X uery expansion X , but our model gave such a prediction can verify that at least two of Dawei Song X  X  papers in 2013 are related to the area  X  X uery expansion X . On the other hand, our model still kept some of his previous top areas such as  X  X uery suggestions X  in the forecast, which was a good prediction since his publications in 2013 indeed had quite a few about this topic. We can also have some similar findings for other two researchers in the table.
We rank all the researchers based on the KL divergence, defined in Section 3.4, from 2012 to 2013. The researchers with large KL divergence are predicted to have a relatively considerable change in their topical areas in the new year. Figure 1 shows the top 5 researchers with the largest pre-dicted KL divergence from 2012 and 2013. To see whether the results make sense, we dig into the researchers X  previ-ous publications, and find out that they all have worked on a quite diverse set of research areas. For example, Kota-giri Ramamohanarao X  X  fields include Machine learning, Data mining, Information retrieval, Logic programming, Distributed systems, Bioinformatics, Medical imaging, and so on. The frequent change of areas would lead to low value in P ( a A | a t , e ) (see Section 3.1, which is based on Jaccard similar-ity between two area sets A t and A t +1 ), and thus would be Table 2: Top areas in 2012 and predicted top areas in 2013 for three researchers Figure 1: The 5 researchers with the largest pre-dicte d KL divergence from 2012 and 2013 expected to have low probability to stick with the current areas.
This paper proposes a novel probabilistic model to inves-tigate and predict how personal expertise evolves over time. The model considers the personality of a given expert, the similarity between new areas and the current ones, and also popularity of new areas. The experimental results demon-strated the effectiveness of the proposed model. This work is an initial step towards a promising researcher direction. In the future work, we will explore more factors in modeling expertise dynamics. We will also conduct a more compre-hensive set of experiments to evaluate the proposed model on large-scale testbeds.
