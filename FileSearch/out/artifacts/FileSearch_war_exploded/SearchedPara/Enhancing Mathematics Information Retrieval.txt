MIR is a broad term for all the activities related to obtaining information from a collection of re-sources and answering an information need that involves mathe-matics in the form of math expressions and formulae. MIR is very important for Digital Mathematics Libraries (DMLs) which gather mathematically oriented documents in which users need to search and navigate e ff ectively. A concrete implementation usually means a search engine that is able to answer a query composed of mathe-matical expressions as well as standard textual keywords searching through a collection with a substantial amount of mathematics.
There are several research groups that aim at creating well per-forming and usable math search engine. Our group located at the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, develops Math Indexer and Searcher (MIaS) [2]  X  a math-aware search engine, currently deployed in EuDML (European Digital Mathematics Library). To the best of my knowledge, it is the only deployment of a MIR system in such a scale. Other deployments, e.g. DML-CZ, are planned. The goal is to design the ultimate math information retrieval system. The ultimateness can be understood as a combination of specific features that all together will support high precision as well as recall in searching documents with mathematical content.
 The main research aspects of MIR are the following: preprocess-ing  X  unifying the input math notation; indexing  X  preparation of the
