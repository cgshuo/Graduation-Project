Future MANETs will carry multimedia applications, so it is important that MANETs provide QoS support in order to provide quality delivery for various data [3]. There are many existing QoS technique, such as QoS model, resource reservation, and QoS route. requirement. The problem of QoS route in MANETs have received intensive attention, however, much difficulty is faced and the existing QoS routing algorithms in wireline network cannot be applied directly due to the natural characters of such network. Those characters include: (1) dynamic network topology for the mobile nodes; (2) dynamic single mobile node; (6) power constrain. The route discovery method based on flooding route request packets will affect the performance of such network badly. It is proved that multiple QoS contains QoS routing problem is a NP-complete problem [8], and the rapidly for the dynamic characters. For these reason, a novel heuristic QoS route dis-covery method for MANETs, named SAANT, is proposed in this paper, which is based on a hybrid heuristic strategy of adaptive ant colony algorithm and simulated annealing. global network information; (3) rout table based on probability reducing the broadcast nealing algorithm is integrated to remedy the weak ability of local search of ant algo-rithm, which is benefit to get fast and efficient search result for changing of MANET topology. This paper is organized as following: related work is compared in section 2; the formal problem model is proposed in sec tion3; in section4, the SAANT algorithm is formance of our proposal. Finally, we include our main result and discuss extensions that can be made in future work. Currently, many study have been done about QoS routing for MANETs by some researchers such as MANET workgroup of IETF. The routing protocols for MANETs may be broadly classified as table driven protocols and on-demand driven protocols [6]. Furthermore, a majority of QoS routing algorithms were developed based on the two periodically. However, although the on-demand protocols are considered as that have lower overhead, but which still have higher route discovery latency and overhead due aim is to search the optimize results (feas ible QoS path) with accepted overhead. Ant colony algorithm have the ability parallel global search, which been applied in network convergence rate. of set V , E is dynamic. If V s  X  is the source node, of one communication, for E e  X   X  , define these metric function as following: Bandwidth function: +  X  R E e B : ) ( . available bandwidth of link E e  X  .

For a unicast link l , we have: The QoS constrains can be expressed as (2): We give the definition of the problem of unicast QoS route discovery in MANETs: satisfy the following condition: rate, and available bandwidth respectively. It X  X  a multi-constrain QoS routing problem, and belongs to NP complete prolem. In this paper, we will propose a hybrid heuristic strategy integrated ant colony algorithm ronment. 4.1 Ant Algorithm Based QoS Route Discovery Ant algorithm belongs to the swarm intelligent, which is proposed by Marco Dorigo seeking food of ant colony. Real ants are capable of finding the shortest path from a food source to their nest by exploiting pheromone information and it is more likely for algorithm has been applied in the pure routing problem widely. The artificial ants are sensing the artificial pheromone. The route se lection of ants is not based on the tradi-rely on the strength of pheromone and the heuristic factors. According to the principle based on the problem model in Def 1.

Also, we revised the formula (4) as: weightiness of each QoS parameters during route selection. pheromone update (5)-(8). It is pivotal for improving the perfor mance of ant algorithm to integrate the phero-update that is based on two reasons: (1) Our rules of pheromone update found on the ant-cycle method [13], which has been proved to be more efficient than those methods ants would be able to process route selection only based local information if the global have not been acquired in time. 4.2 Principle of Simulated Annealing Algorithm 1953, and then be used to solve optimization problems by Kirkpatrick in 1983 firstly. The concept of that is based on the behavior in which metal cools and freezes into a minimum energy crystalline structure (thermodynamic equilibrium) in the process of annealing. Hence the process can be thought of as an adiabatic approach to the lowest as the current solution and give the initial temperature; (3) generate a new solution in the neighborhood of current solution in certain way; (4) estimate the new solution with condition is satisfied. Simulated annealing algorithm's major advantage over other methods is an ability to some degree; at T=0, the global optimize solution will be get. The SA has the powerful ability of local search, which will be integrated our method to improve the probability of discovering QoS route for MANETs. 4.3 SA and Ant Colony Algorithm Based QoS Route Algorithm for MANETs 1) The Principle of Algorithm Ant colony algorithm has the ability of parallel searching solution space and can avoid the problem of local optimize. However, exiting study shows that ant colony algorithm has some disadvantages: (1) relative weak ability of local search and slow convergence load unbalance, and stagnation of exploring the solution space exploration. All of that may be against the dynamic network environment of MANETs. To overcome these problems, some local search method was integr ated in ant colony. For example, in the paper [15], the immune computing is intergraded to solve the problem of weapon target assignment (WTA). SA algorithm has the powerful ability of search solutions in rela-tive small search space rapidly and avoid the problem of local optimize. But the SA is enter the required region. Therefore, we introduce SA to the ant colony algorithm based hybrid optimize strategy, SAANT, that inte grate SA based local search method to ant colony algorithm. The aim is to adjust the intermediate solution in the parallel search process of ants with SA local search that wi ll help to increase the convergence rate of route algorithm and the probability of discovery QoS routes, which is more fit for the nature of MANETs. colony algorithm runs at each distributed mobile node in an ad hoc network, when the find the feasible path; The SA based local search algorithm only runs at source node, and the intermediate solution of ant colony algorithm will be used as the initiate solu-expedite the ant colony algorithm based global search. (2) Data Assumptions To descript the SAANT algorithm clearly, it X  X  necessary to denote the main data object precisely as following. We give the definition of energy equation used in SA first.

In this section, we use a simulation-based method to study the relative performance of the proposed schemes. We have developed a simulated model based on NS2(network simulator 2) [17] simulator. In the following simulations, the simulation environment configurations are showed in table 1. only, and the complete SAANT algorithm with both ant colony algorithm and the SA AODV) where the route discovery is based on the route request packet that is broad-casted completely. estimate algorithm performances: (1) Average Delivery Delay: the average delay of all packets delivered to destinations; (2) Data Delivery Rate: Percentage of data packets delivered to the destinations. The Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 showed the simulation results we have obtained. Fig. 1 shows the comparison of delivery delay for AODV, SAANT without SA and SAANT at difference interval time. All the three policy have a large initial delay for routes information is founded. SAANT has lower delay than both the other two algo-delivery ratio for AODV, SAANT without SA and SAANT in various mobile veloci-That means that the required QoS is not guar anteed due path breaking or nodes move to other position. However, the delivery ratio of SAANT drops down more slowly, which means that SAANT have better performance. In the case of MANETs, it is more im-portant to find a route faster with accepted co st than to search the optimal route with unaccepted time for the dynamic network topology. Therefore, the simulation results show that SAANT is more efficient and effective than the traditional ant colony algo-rithm or on-demand routing method in processing problem of QoS routing for MANETs. applications. Thus, the QoS issues in MANE Ts started to receive increasing cattention in the literature. Any QoS routing algorithm in MANETs should be fit to the natural characters of MANETs. The dynamic network environment, relative low performance, and mesh network topology etc. make the solution more difficult than that in wireline colony algorithm and SA to solve the probl em of QoS route discovery in MANET. Ant based on probability can control flooding to reduce network overhead in the process of route discovery. The local search method ba sed on SA is introduced to increase con-vergence rate of route discovery algorithm and avoid the problem of stagnancy routes. Then, we manifested the performance of proposed algorithm via simulation experiment vation, and QoS violation recovery, will be taken into account in our further coming research.
