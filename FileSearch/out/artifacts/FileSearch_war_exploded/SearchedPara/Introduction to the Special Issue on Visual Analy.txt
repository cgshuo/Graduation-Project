 The information overload is a well-known phenomenon of the information age, since due to the progress in computer power and storage capacity over the last decades, data is produced at an incredible rate, and our ability to collect and store these data is increasing at a faster rate than our ability to analyze it. But, the analysis of these massive, typically messy and inconsistent, volumes of data is crucial in many application domains. For decision makers, analysts or emergency response teams it is an essential task to rapidly extract relevant information from the flood of data. Today, a selected number of software tools is employed to help analysts to organize their information, generate over-views and explore the information space in order to extract potentially useful information. Most of these data analysis systems still rely on interaction metaphors developed more than a decade ago and it is questionable whether they are able to meet the demands of the ever-increasing mass of in-formation. In fact, huge investments in time and money are often lost, because we still lack the possibilities to properly interact with the databases.
 Visual analytics aims at bridging this gap by employing more intelligent means in the analysis process. The basic idea of visual analytics is to visually represent the infor-mation, allowing the human to directly interact with the information, to gain insight, to draw conclusions, and to ul-timately make better decisions. The visual representation of the information reduces complex cognitive work needed to perform certain tasks. People may use visual analytics tools and techniques to synthesize information and derive insight from massive, dynamic, and often conflicting data by pro-viding timely, defensible, and understandable assessments. This special issue presents articles that address interesting, important and diverse issues in visual analytics research and practice.
 The goal of visual analytics research is to turn the informa-tion overload into an opportunity. Decision-makers should be enabled to examine this massive, multi-dimensional, multi-source, time-varying information stream to make effective decisions in time-critical situations. For informed decisions, it is indispensable to include humans in the data analysis process to combine their flexibility, creativity, and back-ground knowledge with the enormous storage capacity and As a consequence, we extended the classical way of visu-ally exploring data sets as defined by the Information Seek-ing Mantra ( X  X verview first, Zoom/ Filter, Details on de-mand X )[3], to the Visual Analytics Mantra [2]: In the age of massive data sets all three steps of the Infor-mation Seeking Mantra are difficult to realize. An overview visualization without losing any interesting pattern or sub-set is difficult to create, since the amount of pixels of modern data display systems do not keep pace with the increasing flood of data. The plenty of information hidden in massive data sets make it very difficult for humans to understand the really interesting or relevant information.
 In Visual Analytics it is therefore not sufficient to just re-trieve and display the data using a visual metaphor, it is rather necessary to support the analyst by analytically fil-tering the underlying data by its value of interest, but at the same time providing interaction models which still allow the user to get any detail of the data on demand.
 This special issue on Visual Analytics attracted a number of high quality submissions from Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, UK, and the US. Each submission was assigned to at least two domain experts for thorough review and evaluation. We selected five submis-sions that best represent the current state of the art in the studies and applications of visual analytics.
 I. Assent, R. Krieger, E. Mueller, and T. Seidl describe a subspace clustering visualization that allows users to browse the entire subspace clustering, to zoom into individual ob-jects, and to analyze subspace cluster characteristics in-depth. Browsing of the clustering result is possible through a novel distance function that reflects the subspace and the object overlap, respectively. Since the paper shows how vi-sual methods can be tighly coupled with automated data mining techniques it address one of the core issues of visual analytics.
 H. Kang, L. Getoor, and L. Singh investigate the use of vi-sual analytics techniques for analyzing dynamic group mem-bership in temporal social networks over time. They present the C-Group tool, that unlike most network visualization tools, which show the group structure within an entire net-work, or the group membership for a single actor, allows users to focus their analysis on a pair of individuals. The authors show how dynamic patterns can be explored in com-plex networks, which is a valuable contribution for a number of visual analytics application domains.
 The article by D. Yang, Z. Xie, E. A. Rundensteiner, and M. O. Ward presents an innovative visual analytics framework for analysis-guided visual exploration of multivariate data. Their system helps users extract the valuable information (nuggets) hidden in datasets based on their interests. Vi-sualization and interaction techniques are designed to help users observe and organize the extracted nuggets in an in-tuitive manner and eventually faciliate their sense-making process. Thus the paper provides a promising combination
