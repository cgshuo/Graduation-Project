 social network communication patterns. Understanding large scale social networks is an emerging area of research [9]. The proble m is made difficult due to the large size of the network and the long term duration of these networks. Hence visualization and summarization tools that enable users to gain insight into the dynamic behavior of these networks are extremely important. 
There has been extensive work in visualization of graph data. Various graph layout algorithms have been developed to enable exploration of large graphs [6]. However graph data that change over time, show only one graph at a single time instance with a slider to move the graph forward / backward in time. However understanding the temporal dynamics in the network is difficult. Prior work in analysis of communication has focused on issues such as the information propagation in blogs [5] and community structure detection. However prior work does not explore email communication patterns that are influenced by both time and people. There also has been little focus on summarizing key social network activity patterns though visual means. There has been prior work in innovative visualizations for data analysis [4,7]. We focus on two aspects not addressed before  X  (a) closely coupling the results of the systematic framework for summarizing the entire social network communication predicated on a topic. 
We address the summarization and visualization problems by solving three sub-problems. (a) defining a ring visualization framework for social network activity providing a single snapshot summary of the entire network activity. Our visualization framework is inspired by the observation that natural phenomena (ref. Fig. 1) can compactly summarize long term activity. The key insight is that compact representation of large scale networks, need not require graph based visualizations. We develop a ring based visualization and summarization framework, that displays relationships between people, time and topic. 
We detect three specific activity patterns  X  periodicity , isolated events and widespread growth at multiple time scales and develop specific ring based visualizations for each activity. The summar ization framework allows us to represent key activity patterns over the entire duration of the network in a compact manner. Periodic patterns in time are detected using local maxima of message activity. Regularity in people refers to people who appear frequently in the conversation  X  this constrained global maxima detection, while distributed growth can be detected using a multi-scale message activity analysis (more details in [2]). We have conducted experiments over the large Enron corpus, and preliminary user studies on the visualization, with excellent results. approach to visualization of large scale network activity. In Section 3, we discuss our activity pattern detection algorithms. In Section 4 we present out summarization algorithm. In Section 5 we discuss our experimental results and then present our conclusions. In this Section we will present our visualization framework. The central innovation in our approach is that visual displays of temporal dynamics of large scale social networks can be accomplished without using graph based layout mechanisms. 2.1 Graphs Do Not Reveal Network Temporal Dynamics We are addressing the problem of visualizing email communication amongst system, we are using the Enron Data set. Th is dataset was collected and prepared by the CALO Project [3]. It contains email data from about 150 users, from senior management of Enron, organized into folder s. The corpus contains a total of about 0.5M messages. In our system, we create an edge between two nodes (people) if there is evidence of communication between them. Graphs can be very useful to understand graphs do not reveal the temporal dynamics of the communication in the social instant. This can be a significant problem in large networks such as the Enron corpus that has large user set (150) and significant communication activity over a long duration. Simple techniques such as animation, graph aggregation will not work well. 2.2 Our Approach: Rings The intuition behind our visualization comes from observing phenomena in the from the center and radiate outward. We observe that the growth or spread of energy in these phenomena happens in a radial direction starting from the innermost towards the outermost ring. This creates two constraints  X  (a) temporal: the outermost ring / ripple represents the earliest temporal event. (b) rotational: the relative orientation of each ring is not arbitrary  X  a line from the center to the outermost ring corresponds to message preprocessing. Message preprocessing: We assume that the user provides a topic, i.e. a keyword. We then find all messages in the corpus relevant to the given topic. Since our focus is on the visualization rather than information retrieval, we are using a simple keyword people -the sender and the set of recipients. In our system, users can browse through three categories from their email ids  X  (a) network members  X  employees amongst employees of Enron not part of the initial 150 people and (c) external  X  people outside of Enron. Design Elements: We designed a visualization that indicates multiple graphs that vary over time, in a single snapshot (Figure 2). We now explain the design elements of our visualization. The graph structure: The graph structure is not obvious when using rings. We have dealt with this issue by indicating the actual communication graph structure when the rest of the nodes in other time rings are dimmed out by changing their color saturation. We now discuss the detection and visualization of three specific temporal communication patterns (periodic, isolated and widespread) in a social network to help summarize the activity with respect to a certain topic. The activity patterns we describe are an extension of the chatter and spiky communication patterns in blogspace that are described in [5]. We add two novel patterns  X  distributed growth and regulars in communication over time, the activity patterns we describe depend on both time and people. We assume that we are given the topic and the corresponding set of relevant messages (ref. Section 2.2). 3.1 Periodic Activity Patterns people. Periodic patterns over time refer to high message activity in the network relevant to a particular topic that appears in regular time intervals. Detecting periodicity in time: Periodic patterns in time are revealed by detecting the local maxima in message activity and then imposing simple temporal constraints on the maxima. The periodicity detection al gorithm proceeds as follows. First all messages are ordered in time, and then grouped according to any chosen scale (weekly, monthly, quarterly). Then each time slot is given an activity score using the following equation: involving large number of messages and recipients. All the local maxima from the are computed from each peak to every other peak and stored in a table per peak. The We consider a period to be valid only if ther e exists at least one set of three peaks at with that period. 
Temporal periodic patterns are easily understood using rings. Every time period with a distinct color. occur together, frequently, over the duration of the topic. This can be detected using a according to the time scale. These subs ets of people form groups that are the (representing people) in the visualization that are part of the same set are colored with revealed. Their radius is also increased and the background is dimmed out in order to prominently display the regulars in the topic. 3.2 Isolated Patterns spikes) over time and people. Isolated patterns over time refer to significant message generators  X  a small set of people, who contribute to most of the messages. there exists local maxima in activity, (b) the message activity exceeds a certain threshold and (c) the activity exhibits a sharp rise and fall in small time duration. messages relevant to the particular topic. We use equation (1) to calculate the score of each time slot, which depends on both the number of messages and the number of recipients per message. The global maxima verified with the above constraints are then visualized. In order to indicate spikes in time for the given topic to the user, we highlight the time slot in which the maxima occurred. We additionally increase the radius of all nodes representing people communicating in that time slot. Spikes in people: Spikes in people refer to the information generators  X  a small set of people who send a large percentage of messages relevant to the topic. We now define two measures  X  (sender coverage) and  X  (message coverage), to be as follows. where N s is the number of unique senders, and m j is the number of messages corresponding N s  X  the minimum number of senders required to generate those messages. The information generator set is determined by determining N s using are then the information generators for the given topic. We determined the thresholds (  X  = 0.65 and  X  0 = 0.15) using a training set [2]. Sp ikes in people in are indicated our visualization, by increasing the size of nodes that are spikes in people in all times that they occur. We also place them along equidi stant radial lines. Details of our algorithm to detect and visualize distributed growth can be found in [2]. In this Section we discuss the problem of summarizing the key activity patterns in a activity patterns and (b) developing a single representative snapshot. The visualization problem is difficult since the activity patterns need not co-occur within the same time window. 4.1 Ranking the Activity Patterns Each activity detector (ref. Section 3) returns a set of detected activities. We thus need to develop measures to order the activities within each set. We now discuss a systematic ranking measure for each activity pattern. We will now discuss how we construct a summary snapshot to indicate all the key activity patterns, given a certain topic. 4.2 Constructing the Summary Snapshot Each of the activity patterns detected could occur at different times as well as involve different people. Hence indicating all of them within the same screen is difficult, especially if the time range is bigger than the maximum that can be shown in the available display area. Instead, we have constructed a representative summary snapshot that only visually indicates the key patterns for messages of the given topic, interactive summary, where the user can then click on the pattern of interest to go to the ring visualization and see the actual time period corresponding to the activity pattern of interest. The Figure 3 shows an example summary snapshot of the query  X  X alifornia X  in the monthly scale. The visualization and summarization framework was implemented in Java and Processing [1] with the Mysql database as the backend. In order to evaluate the system, we conducted a preliminary user study with five graduate students. Users were asked to interact with the system by executing several text queries (e.g.  X  X ower crisis X ,  X  X alifornia X ,  X  X rading X  etc.). They were then asked to answer questions on various aspects of the system on a scale of one to seven. The results are summarized in Table 1 and indicate that users find the activity patterns as well as the visualization to be very useful in understanding email communication. Users also suggested various improvements such as (a) visualizing relationships between a single person, time and the topic, rather than the entire social network, (b) comparing communication activity for multiple topics in the same visualization. 
We acknowledge that this is only a preliminary evaluation  X  the actual study would involve applying our visualization techni que to emails from an organization and allowing members of the same organization to evaluate whether the visualization was able to communicate temporal patterns well. We also ran activity pattern detection algorithms on 100 queries on the Enron data. The detailed results can be found in [2]. In this paper, we proposed a framework for visualization and summarization of email communication activity in large social networks. The framework addressed three challenges (a) visualization (b) activity pattern detection and (c) summarization. The novel ring visualization scheme depicts multiple graphs in the same snapshot and enables users to understand communication activ ity that varies over multiple scales in time. We also defined and detected three classes of communication activity patterns activity patterns are then summarized by ranking activity patterns and constructing a single snapshot that communicates all key activity patterns to the user. Preliminary experiments and user study results are promising and we plan to conduct further extensive evaluation.
