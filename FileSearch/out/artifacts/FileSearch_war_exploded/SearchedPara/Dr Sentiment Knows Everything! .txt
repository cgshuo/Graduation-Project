 In order to identify sentiment from a text, lexical analysis plays a crucial role. For example, words like love, hate, good and favorite directly indicate sentiment or opinion. Previous works (Pang et al., 2002; Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Baccianella et. al., 2010) have already proposed various tech-niques for making dictionaries for those sentiment words. But polarity assignment of such sentiment lexicons is a hard semantic disambiguation prob-lem. The regulating aspects which govern the lexi-cal level semantic orientation are natural language context (Pang et al., 2002), language properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Gamon, 2005), time dimen-sion (Read, 2005), colors and culture (Strapparava and Ozbal, 2010) and many more unrevealed hid-den aspects. Therefore it is a challenging and enigmatic research problem. 
The current trend is to attach prior polarity to each entry at the sentiment lexicon level. Prior po -larity is an approximation value based on heuristic s based statistics collected from corpus and not ex-act. The probabilistic fixed point prior polarity scores do not solve the problem completely rather it places the problem into next level, called conte x-tual polarity classification. 
We start with the hypothesis that the summation of all the regulating aspects of sentiment orienta-tion is human psychology and thus it is a multi-faceted problem (Liu, 2010). More precisely what we mean by human psychology is the union of all known and unknown aspects that directly or indi-rectly govern the sentiment orientation knowledge of us. The regulating aspects wrapped in the present PsychoSentiWordNet are Gender , Age , City , Country , Language and Profession . 
The PsychoSentiWordNet is an extension of the existing SentiWordNet 3.0 (Baccianella et. al., 2010) to hold the possible psychological ingre-dients and govern the sentiment understandability of us. The PsychoSentiWordNet holds variable prior polarity scores that could be fetched depend-ing upon those psychological regulating aspects. An example with the input word  X  High  X  may illu-strate the definition better: Aspects (Profession) Polarity Null Positive Businessman Negative Share Broker Positive 
In this paper, we propose an interactive gaming (Dr Sentiment) technology to collect psycho-sentimental polarity for lexicons. This technology has proven itself as an excellent technique to col-lect psychological sentiment of human society even at multilingual level. Dr Sentiment presently supports 56 languages and therefore we may call it Global PsychoSentiWordNet . The supported lan-guages by Dr Sentiment are reported in Table 1. 
In this section we have philosophically argued about the necessity of developing PsychoSenti-WordNet. In the next section 2 we will describe the technical details of the proposed architecture for building the lexical resource. Section 3 explains about some exciting outcomes of PsychoSenti-WordNet. The developed PsychoSentiWordNet(s) are expected to help automatic sentiment analysis research in many aspects and other disciplines as well and have been described in section 4.The data structure and the organization are described in sec -tion 5. The conclusion is drawn in section 6. Dr Sentiment 1 is a template based interactive on-line game, which collects player X  X  sentiment by asking a set of simple template based questions and finally reveals a player X  X  sentimental status. Dr Sentiment fetches random words from Senti-WordNet synsets and asks every player to tell about his/her sentiment polarity understanding re-garding the concept behind the word fetched by it. 
There are several motivations behind developing the intuitive game to automatically collect human psycho-sentimental orientation information. 
In the history of Information Retrieval research there is a milestone when ESP game 2 (Ahn et al., 2004) innovated the concept of a game to automat-ically label images available in the World Wide Web. It has been identified as the most reliable strategy to automatically annotate the online im-ages. We are highly motivated by the success of the Image Labeler game. 
A number of research endeavors could be found in the literature for creation of Sentiment Lexicon in several languages and domains. These tech-niques can be broadly categorized into two classes, one follows classical manual annotation techniques (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006);(Wiebe and Ri-loff, 2006) while the other follows various auto-matic techniques (Mohammad et al., 2008). Both types of techniques have few limitations. Manual annotation techniques are undoubtedly trustable but it generally takes time. Automatic techniques demand manual validations and are dependent on the corpus availability in the respective domain. Manual annotation techniques require a large num-ber of annotators to balance one X  X  sentimentality i n order to reach agreement. But human annotators are quite unavailable and costly. 
Sentiment is a property of human intelligence and is not entirely based on the features of a lan-guage. Thus people X  X  involvement is required to capture the sentiment of the human society. We have developed an online game to attract internet population for the creation of PsychoSentiWord-Net automatically. Involvement of Internet popula-tion is an effective approach as the population is very high in number and ever growing (approx. 360,985,492) 3 . Internet population consists of people with various languages, cultures, age etc and thus not biased towards any domain, language or particular society. A detailed statistics on the Internet usage and population has been reported in the Table 2. 
The lexicons tagged by this system are credible as it is tagged by human beings. It is not a static sentiment lexicon set [polarity changes with time (Read, 2005)] as it is updated regularly. Around 10-20 players each day are playing it throughout the world in different languages. The average number of tagging per word is about 7.47 till date.
The Sign Up form of the  X  X r Sentiment X  game asks the player to provide personal information such as Sex, Age, City, Country, Language and Profession. These collected personal details of a player are kept as a log record in the database. 
The gaming interface has four types of question templates. The question templates are named as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4. To make the gaming interface more interesting images have been added. These images have been retrieved by Google image search API 4 and to avoid biasness we have randomized among the first ten images retrieved by Google. 2.1 Gaming Strategy Dr Sentiment asks 30 questions to each player. There are predefined distributions of each question type as 11 for Q1, 11 for Q2, 4 for Q3 and 4 for Q4. These numbers are arbitrarily chosen and ran-domly changed for experimentation. The questions are randomly asked to keep the game more inter-esting. For word based translation Google transla-tion 5 service has been used. At each Question (Q) level translation service has been used to display the sentiment word into player X  X  own language. Google API provides multiple senses for word lev-el translation and currently only the first sense h as been picked automatically. 2.2 Q1 An English word from the English SentiWordNet synset is randomly chosen. The Google image search API is fired with the word as a query. An image along with the word itself is shown in the Q1 page of the game. 
Players press the different emoticons (Figure 1) to express their sentimentality. The interface keep s log records of each interaction. 
Figure 1: Emoticons to Express Player X  X  Senti-2.3 Q2 This question type is specially designed for relati ve scoring technique. For example: good and better both are positive but we need to know which one is more positive than other. Table 3 shows how in SentiWordNet relative scoring has been made. With the present gaming technology relative polar-ity scoring has been assigned to each n-n word pair combination. 
Randomly n (presently 2-4) words have been chosen from the source SentiWordNet synsets along with their images as retrieved by Google API. Each player is then asked to select one of them that he/she likes most. The relative score is calculated and stored in the corresponding log ta-ble. The player is asked for any positive word in his/he r mind. This technique helps to increase the cover-age of existing SentiWordNet. The word is then added to the existing PsychoSentiWordNet and further used in Q1 to other users to note their sen -timentality about the particular word. 2.5 Q4 A player is asked by Dr Sentiment about any nega-tive word. The word is then added to the existing PsychoSentiWordNet and further used in Q1 to other users to note their sentimentality about the particular word. 2.6 Comment Architecture There are three types of Comments, Comment type 1 (CMNT1), Comment type 2 (CMNT2) and the final comment as Dr Sentiment X  X  prescription. CMNT1 type and CMNT2 type comments are as-sociated with question types Q1 and Q2 respective-ly. 2.6.1 CMNT1 Comment type 1 has 5 variations as shown in the Comment table in Table 4. Comments are random-ly retrieved from comment type table according to their category: 2.6.2 CMNT2 The strategy here is as same as the CMNT 1. Comment type 2 has only two variations as. 2.7 Dr Sentiment X  X  Prescription The final prescription depends on various factors such as total number of positive, negative or neu-tral comments and the total time taken by any player. The final prescription also depends on the range of the accumulated values of all the above factors. 
This is the most important appealing factor to a player. The motivating message for players is that Dr Sentiment can reveal their sentimental status: whether they are extreme negative or positive or very much neutral or diplomatic etc. It is not claimed that the revealed status of a player by Dr Sentiment is exact or ideal. It is only to make the players motivated but the outcomes of the game effectively helps to store human sentimental psy-chology in terms of computational lexicon. 
A word previously tagged by a player is avoided by the tracking system during subsequent turns by the same player. The intension is to tag more and more words involving Internet population. We ob-serve that the strategy helps to keep the game in-teresting as a large number of players return to play the game after this strategy was implemented. PsychoSentiWordNet gives a good sketch to un-derstand the psycho-sentimental behavior of the human society depending upon proposed psycho-logical dimensions. The PsychoSentiWordNet is basically the log records of every player X  X  tagged words. 3.1 Concept-Culture-Wise Analysis The word  X  X lue X  gets tagged by different players around the world. But surprisingly it has been tagged as positive from one part of the world and negative from another part of the world. The graphical illustration in Figure 2 may explain the situation better. The observation is that most of t he negative tags are coming from the middle-east and especially from the Islamic countries. We found a line in Wiki 6 (see in Religion Section) that may provide a good explanation:  X  X lue in Is-lam: In verse 20:102 of the Qur X  X n, the word  X  X  X  zurq (plural of azraq 'blue') is used metaphoricall y for evil doers whose eyes are glazed with fear X . But other explanations may be there for this situa-tion. This is an interesting observation that sup-ports the effectiveness of the developed PsychoSentiWordNet. This information could be further retrieved from the developed source by giv-ing information like (blue, Italy), (blue, Iraq) or (blue, USA) etc. 3.2 Age-Wise Analysis Another interesting observation is that sentimental -ity may vary age-wise. For better understanding we look at the total statistics and the age wise distr ibu-tion of all the players. Total 533 players have tak en part till date. The total number of players for eac h range of age is shown at the top of every bar. In Figure 3 the horizontal bars are divided into tw o colors (Green depicts the Positivity and Red de-picts the negativity) according to the total positi vi-ty and negativity scores, gathered during playing. This sociological study gives an idea on the varia-tion of sentimentality with age. This information may be retrieved from the developed source by giving information like (X, 36-39) or (X, 45-49) etc where X denotes any arbitrary lexicon synset. 3.3 Gender-Wise Analysis It is observed from the collected statistics that women are more positive than men! The variations in sentimentality among men and women are shown in the following Figure 4. 3.4 Other-Wise We have described several important observations in the previous sections and there are other impor-tant observations as well. Studies on the combina-tions of the proposed psychological dimensions, such as, location-age, location-profession and gender-location may reveal some interesting re-sults. Undoubtedly the generated PsychoSentiWord-Net(s) are important resources for senti-ment/opinion or emotion analysis task. Moreover the other non linguistic psychological dimensions are very much important for further analysis as well as for several newly discovered sub-disciplines such as: Geospatial Information retriev -al (Egenhofer, 2002), Personalized search (Gaucha et al., 2003), Recommender System (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin, 2005), Sentiment Tracking (Tong, 2001) etc. Deciding on the data structure for the PsychoSen-tiWordNet was not trivial. Presently RDBMS (Re-lational Database Management System) has been used. Several tables are being used to keep user X  X  clicking log and their personal information. 
As one of the research motivations was to gen-erate up-to-date prior polarity scores across vario us dimensions, we decided to generate web service API through which the people can access latest prior polarity scores. The developed PsychoSenti-WordNet is expected to perform better than a static sentiment lexicon. In the present paper the development of the Psy-choSentiWordNet for 56 languages has been de-scribed. No evaluation has been done yet as there is no data available for this kind of experimenta-tion and to the best of our knowledge this is the first endeavor where sentiment analysis meets AI and psychology. 
Our present goal is to collect such corpus and carry out experiments to check whether variable prior polarity scores of PsychoSentiWordNet excel over the fixed point prior polarity score of Senti-WordNet. 
Automatically picked first sense from Google translation API may cause difficulties for cross lingual projection of sentiment synsets. Erroneous outputs from API may also cause some problems. But these problems lead to another research issue that may be termed as cross lingual sentiment syn-set linking. Presently we are giving a closer look to the qualitative analysis of developed multilingual psycho-sentiment lexicons. The work reported in this paper was supported by a grant from the India-Japan Cooperative Program (DST-JST) Research project entitled  X  Sentiment Analysis where AI meets Psychology  X  funded by Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India.
