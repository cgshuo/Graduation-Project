 Heterogeneous information networks are logical networks involving multiple typed objects and multiple typed links denoting different relationships, such as bibliographic networks, social media networks, and the knowledge network encoded in Wikipedia [1, 19]. In many heterogeneous information networks, the links could have positive or negative polarity denoting the positive or negative views and opinions of people. For instance, in Epinions network, consumers rate the products expressing viewpoints of likes or dislikes; in Slashdot Zoo, users can tag others as friends or foes. Such activities constitute the meaningful signed heterogeneous information networks, where links can be positive ( X  X ike X ,  X  X rust X ) or negative ( X  X islike X ,  X  X istrust X ). 
In recent years, relevance or similarity search on heterogeneous information net-different linkage paths in the network, one could derive various relevance semantics, therefore, conventional work on relevance search usually take advantage of the vari-ous meta-paths which may contain different relevance semantics between objects. A meta-path is a path consisting of a sequence of relationships defined between different types of objects, namely the structural paths at the meta level. However, conventional research mainly focuses on non-signed information network, without considering the polarity of the links in the network. 
The relevance could be computed simply based on meta-path in non-signed infor-meta-paths with negative links in a signed heterogeneous information network, espe-cially when several different negative links exist simultaneously in one path, making the semantic more ambiguous. Directly utilizing previous meta-path-based methods to relevance search in signed heterogeneous networks might get undesirable or even totally opposite results. Therefore, it is challenging to model the meta-paths with both networks. 
In this paper, we propose a novel relevance search approach called SignSim to formation network based on signed meta-path factorization. SignSim firstly defines the atomic meta-paths, based on which the computing paradigm of the similarity be-tween objects with the same type, with collaborative filtering using positive and nega-tive user preferences. Then, on basis of the combination of different atomic me-based on multi-length signed meta-paths. 
The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follow. (1)For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we investigate the problem of relevance search in signed heterogeneous information networks. (2)A novel signed meta-path factoriza-tion based approach named SignSim for relevance search in signed heterogeneous information networks is proposed. To measure the relatedness between objects of different types, SignSim can effectively capture the positive and negative link seman-tics along the meta-paths. (3)Experiments on real-world dataset demonstrate the ef-fectiveness of SignSim, by comparison with state-of-the-art approaches on non-signed heterogeneous information network. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We introduce the concepts and defi-method. We discuss related work in Sections 5, and conclude the study in Section 6. In this section, we introduce some concepts and notations to help us state the studied problem. Definition 1. (Signed Heterogeneous Information Network) : A signed heterogeneous function  X  : V  X  A and link type mapping function  X  : E v  X  V belongs to a particular object type  X  (v)  X  A and each link e ticular relation  X  (e)  X  R. For each link e  X  E, it has polarity s(e)
As an example, a toy IMDB network is given in Fig.1. It is a typical signed hete-(M), genres (G), directors (D), and actors (A). Definition 2. (Signed Network Schema) : The signed network schema, denoted as T =(A, R), is a meta-level template for a signed heterogeneous network G=(V, E) with the object type mapping  X  : V  X  A and the link type mapping types, guiding the exploration of the semantics in the network. 
For the IMDB network defined in Fig.1, the network schema is shown in Fig.2. The links between users and movies denote the rating or rated-by relationships with positive or negative polarities, while the links between movies and other types of entities only have the positive polarity. Definition 3. (Signed Meta-path) : The signed meta-path is a directed path defined on meta-level description of a path instance between two objects with type A respectively, usually abbreviated as R 1 R 2  X  X  X R L or A Definition 4. (Atomic Meta-path) : Atomic meta-path is a minimum part of a signed meta-path that can be used to compute the similarity between objects of the same type. Definition 5. (Meta-path Factorization) : Meta-path factorization splits a signed from different types can be computed based on the signed meta-paths. ta-path of the network schema shown in Fig.2. It denotes that two users have rated the between users and movies based on meta-path UMUM, SignSim uses meta-path fac-torization and splits the meta-path into UMU and UM. UMU is an atomic meta-path, meta-path, but based on UM the relevance between users and movies can be computed directly. Then SignSim combines the computing results and gets the final relevance. Problem Statement. (Relevance Search on Signed Heterogeneous Network): In a signed heterogeneous information network G=(V, E), for a given node s get type T, how to find the nodes in V of type T which are most relevant to s. In this section, we elaborate a signed meta-path-based relevance framework and a novel calculates the relatedness between users and movies based on multiple signed meta-paths. 3.1 Framework Due to the signed meta-path has positive or negative polarity, we cannot directly use the meta-path-based relevance measure to compute the relevance between objects from different types in the signed heterogeneous information network. Therefore, SignSim first splits the signed meta-path, getting computable atomic meta-paths, and then combines the computing results. 
SignSim mainly has two points: (1) It splits the meta-path into multiple atomic me-computes the relevance between objects of different types based on the combination of the similarity computed by various atomic meta-paths. The signed meta-paths can be obtained by traversing on the network schema using factorization. In meta-path factorization, we always find the first match to the atomic meta-path, and then repeat the above procedure on the remaining meta-path. We sep-arate out the mismatch path and call them redundant meta-path . For example, from decomposed to redundant meta-path 1 meta-path factorization is shown in Algorithm 1. The main idea of SignSim can be expressed by following three formulas. 
Formula (1) represents the decomposition of meta-path P , and the atomic meta-path or redundant meta-path. 
In formula (2), U i is the possible target node space of the node o the set of the object o i positively related to object o signsim o o sim o o sim o o sim o o PPPP
In formula (3), on meta-path 3.2 Atomic Meta-path-Based Similarity Measure atomic meta-paths and measure the similarity between objects of the same type. Based on Algorithm 1, we find out three kinds of atomic meta-paths. Atomic Meta-path: UMU. The atomic meta-path UMU describes the two users seeing between the two users is measured based on this atomic meta-path. We construct an n * m adjacency matrix the network, denoting the degree of user's preference to the movie. The m is the number of movies and n is the number of users. We denote the row of the matrix with vector u in which i (1&lt;= i &lt;= n ) is the row number. The similarity between the two users u is measured by cosine similarity based on vector space model. That is: 
If (, | ) sim u u UMU  X   X  , the user u i is considered as si milar to the user u threshold parameter , which will be discussed in the experiments. Atomic Meta-path: MUM. The atomic meta-path MUM describes the two movies seen by the same user. It contains two edges and both of them are signed. The similarity between two movies is measured based on the atomic meta-path. 
We can measure the similarity between two movies based on the same adjacency matrix as presented above. We denote the row of matrix with vector m measure between movies m i and m j is: Atomic Meta-path: MPM. The atomic meta-path MPM describes the two movies having common attributes (genres, directors, or actors). Here P represents G (genres), D (directors), and A (actors). It contains two edges and neither of them is signed. It is formula (4) and (5). 3.3 Signed Meta-path-based Relevance Measure For non-atomic meta-paths, we measure the relevance between objects by signed meta-path factorization. Different paths represent different semantics, thus path selec-length of the meta-path may also affect the performance, and the previous works have shown that the accuracy will decrease as the length increases [6, 14]. In this section, we only study the meta-paths whose length is less than five. Redundant Meta-path: UM. The redundant meta-path UM, containing a signed edge, describes the movie seen by the user, and the relevance between user u and movie m can be measured based on it. The relevance based on redundant meta-path can be computed directly without meta -path factorization. That is: where )  X  + i DUM u is the neighbor set of node u i based on positive edges of UM, and DUM u is the neighbor set of u i based on negative edges of UM. Meta-path: UMUM. The meta-path UMUM contains three edges and all of them are signed. For measuring the relevance between users and movies based on UMUM, we split it into one atomic meta-path UMU and one redundant meta-path UM, and compute tively, the factorization means we find out the most similar users to the source user, and then we collect a set of favorite movies of these most similar users to the source user. The procedure can be formally depicted as follows: where relatedness between u 2 and m based on meta-path UM . Meta-path: UMUMUM. This meta-path contains five edges and all of them are signed. For measuring the relevance between users and movies, we split the meta-path UMUMUM into UMU, UMU, and UM. Similarly, we first find out a set U similar users with the source user based on meta-path UMU. Then, we find out a set U of most similar users with users of set U 2 based on meta-path UMU. Finally, we collect a set of favorite movies of these users of set U 3 . The procedure can be formally depicted as follows: Meta-path: UMPM. This atomic meta-path contains three edges and one of them is a meta-path into one redundant meta-path and one atomic meta-path, which are UM and MPM. Meta-path: UMPMPM. This meta-path contains five edges and one of them is signed. redundant meta-path and two atomic meta-paths, which are UM, MPM and MPM. Meta-path: UMPMUM. This meta-path contains five edges and of which three are signed. For measuring the relevance between user and movie, we could split this me-ta-path into three meta-paths, which are UM, MPM, and MUM. Meta-path: UMUMPM. This meta-path contains five edges and of which three are three meta-paths, which are UMU, UM, and MPM. 4.1 Experimental Setup hetrec2011-movielens [18]. The dataset contains 2,113 users, 10,197 movies, 20 movie genres, 4,060 directors, and 11,019 actors. We extract the first two actors according to the actor ranking of movies. On average, there are 2.04 genres, 2 actors and 1 director types of objects: user, movie, director, actor and genre. Evaluation Metric. To evaluate our approach, we first sort all the rating records in the dataset according to the timestamp. For each us er, the latest 30% movies he or she has rated are selected as testing data and the ol d ones are selected as training data. When conducting relevance search, we generate a list of K movies named Ru for each user u . rating can be calculated as follows: to evaluate the relevance search results. We select the following approaches as baselines: MatrixCal: MatrixCal is the na X ve algorithm to calculate relevance between users and also obtained. Then the preference matrix an d feature matrix were multiplied together. HeteSim: HeteSim[14] can measure the relatedness of objects with the same or different types in heterogeneous networks. The relatedness of object pairs is defined based on the search path that connects two objects through following a sequence of node types. 4.2 Experimental Results Case Study. In the following experiments, we set parameters the similarity threshold of objects in the same type and K is a parameter to control the number of movies recommended, and single out a user with ID 7815 as the source user. 
Table 1 shows the top K search results of SignSim with varied meta-paths. We results in Table 2. In both tables, the bold ite ms mean the searched movies are hit, and the figures in brackets denote the score rated by the user. measure the relevance of objects. Table 2 shows the results with different algorithms. The results given by SignSim are better than the two baselines.
 Quantitative Comparison. In this section, we quantitatively compare the proposed SignSim with two baselines. Fig.3 shows the results of different algorithms. One can HeteSim and MatrixCal. 
As mentioned above, the length of meta-path can significantly affect the relevance ta-path length increases. Fig.4 shows the effect of different length of meta-paths. and  X  is used to control the similarity between the same types of objects. 
Fig.5 shows the results with various K values. One can see from Fig.5 that the per-larger K can hurt the accuracy. 
Fig.6 shows the performance of SignSim with the varied threshold parameters. One can see from Fig.6 that the performance of SignSim increases as the the meta-paths of UMUM, UMPM and UMUMUM, which means a higher similarity between the same type of objects helps to improve the final search accuracy, although the growth trend is not significant. As for UMPMUM before decrease as the  X  increases and after  X  =0.08, the performance increase slowly. On the whole, SignSim can get a fairly better performance when  X 
As to meta-path UMUMPM and UMPMPM, due to the space limit, we do not de-scribe them in detail here. Their results are similar to those of other meta-paths. Relevance search on information network has gained wide attentions from researchers in The most related work to relevance search is similarity search. Similarity calculation is mining and natural language processing. Research on similarity search has made many broadly divided into two types: feature-based approach and link-based approach. Feature-based measurement method is base d on the characteristics of the object. take the links between objects into account, so they cannot apply to network data. 
Link-based approach is based on topological similarity of the object. SimRank [4] is a objects are similar if their neighbors are similar. Due to its relatively high computational complexity, most of the follow-up studies focus on how to improve the efficiency of the algorithm [17]. SCAN [2] is a structure clustering algorithm, which calculates the simi-larity between two objects through comparing their neighbor sets, while [6] proposed a meta-path-based similarity measure PathSim, which considers that objects are not only However, this approach just considers the objects with the same type. Different from the on a fundamental assumption that all edges are positive. focus on homogeneous networks which have only one type of objects and one type of links. However, many networks in the real world, such as Epinions, Slashdot Zoo, and Wikipedia, are both signed and heterogeneous composed of multiple types of objects and multiple types of links. Therefore it is necessary to study new methods to address knowledge discovery in signed heterogeneous network. In the paper, we study the relevance search problem in signed heterogeneous informa-tion networks. A novel relevance search approach called SignSim is proposed. Based with various types to a given object in the signed heterogeneous information net-utilizing the atomic meta-paths, SignSim next proposes to measure the similarity be-tween objects of the same type. Finally, SignSim integrates various similarity results to measure the relatedness between objects from different types based on non-atomic signed meta-paths. Experimental results on a real-world dataset verify the effectiveness of the approach. In this paper, we only study the relevance based on individual signed meta-paths. Our future work will consider the combination of different signed me-ta-paths to get global relevance.
