 section, we introduce two measures for capturing association among a set of items in a database. 3. New measures of association X be { x 1 , x 2 , ... , x m }. The following notations are used frequently in this paper:  X  Y # X S  X \ m i  X  1 f x i g ; D  X  : support of Boolean expression that a transaction in D contains all the items of X action. One could define association among a set of items in many ways. Our first measure of association A follows.
 association A 1 is defined as follows: among themselves.
 association A 2 is defined as follows.
 association A 2 is defined as follows: as follows: Variable j Y j / j X j has conditional support CS X ( Y , D ), for Y # X , and j Y j P 2. Conditional support CS transactions containing Y among the transactions containing at least one item of X . 4. Properties of A 1 and A 2 Corollary D12.1. Let X = { x 1 ,x 2 } be an itemset in database D. Then proposed measures, we state below monotone property of a measure of association. items of X have stronger association, for Y # X, and j Y j P 2.

A 2 satisfies monotone property, for every Y # X , and j Y j P 2. But, A j Y j P 2. Therefore, A 2 is more appealing measure of association than A association among items of an itemset more accurately than A that the association among items of { b , c , d } is closer to 0.5714 than 0.2857.
Moreover, the Examples 2 and 3 presented later, also show that A at all the situations.

In Section 6, experimental results are provided using measure A interesting properties of A 2 .
 Lemma 1. Let X = { x 1 ,x 2 , ... ,x m } be an itemset in database D. Also, let T  X  i  X  X  can be expressed as follows: distinct h Y i s, and thus, we have m C m k distinct expressions for S of S
X h Y , D i contain a particular itemset Y 1 of size m 1. Y expressions of S X h Y , D i that contain Y 1 is m 1 C m k
We verify Lemma 1 with the help of following example. Let X ={ x S hf x 2 ; x 3 g ; D i X  S  X f x 1 ; x 2 g ; D  X  S  X f x 1 ; x

Lemma 2. Let X = { x 1 ,x 2 , ... ,x m } be an itemset in database D. Then Proof since the coefficient of p m
We verify Lemma 2 with the help of following example. Let X ={ x We use Lemma 2 for proving Lemma 3 .
 Lemma 3. Let X = { x 1 ,x 2 , ... ,x m } be an itemset in database D, for an integer m P 2. Proof Lemma 3 gives a simple expression for A 2 . A few corollaries of Lemma 3 are given below.
Corollary L3.2. Let X = { x 1 ,x 2 , ... ,x m } be an itemset in database D. Then, A S hf x i g ; D i = S  X [ m i  X  1 f x i g ; D  X  .q i /m is the contribution of item x Based on measure A 2 , we define an associative itemset as follows.
 at level d if A 2 ( X , D ) P d .

Example 2. We consider the following three transactional databases. Let D e },{ b , d , g },{ c , d },{ f , g },{ g , h }}. Let a = 0.2,and d = 0.4. In database D
Thus, the itemset { a , b } is not frequent and also not associative. In database D
A ({ a , b }, D 2 ) = 1/4. Thus, the itemset { a , b } is frequent but not associative. In database D
A ({ a , b }, D 3 )= A 2 ({ a , b }, D 3 ) = 3/5. Thus, the itemset { a , b } is frequent as well as associative. set might be available frequently in different transactions.

Example 3. Consider the database D 1 of Example 1 . Let a = 0.2, and d = 0.4. S ({ c , d , e }, D Thus, the itemset { c , d , e } is associative, but not frequent.
 prove that association among items of a frequent itemset is always greater than or equal to a under A set is associative at level a .

Lemma 4. Let X = { x 1 ,x 2 , ... ,x m } be a frequent itemset in database D, for an integer m P 2. Then, A Proof
S  X  X ; D  X  P a implies S  X  X ; D  X  = S  X [ m i  X  1 f x i g ; D  X  P a ; since 0 &lt; S  X [ m
In Lemma 5 , we discuss an important property of A 2 . Association among items of an itemset under A 2, we get A 2 ( X , D ) &gt; 0, for m P 2. We shall use the method of induction on j X j to show that A X ={ x 1 , x 2 }. Then,
Also, S X hf x i g ; D i X  S  X f x i g ; D  X  S  X f x 1 g\f x
We have, S ({ x 1 } \ { x 2 }, D ) 6 S ({ x 1 }, D )and S ({ x We assume that the result is true for m 6 k 1. Now, we shall prove that it is true for m = k . establish the relationship between A 2 ( X , D ) and A 2 ( Y , D ). Using formula (20) we get, or, A 2 ( X , D )= A 2 ( Y , D ) K 1 + K 2 , where
We note that, 0 &lt; K 1 , K 2 6 1. There does not exist any fixed relationship between A j Y j = j X j 1, and j X j P 3. We consider the following example.

A ({ a , c }, D 4 ) = 0.16667, A 2 ({ a , b , c }, D 4 ) = 0.5. We observe that, A We wish to express A 2 in terms of supports of different itemsets. Given an itemset X , the Lemma 6 expresses S terms of the support of itemset Y # X , for x i 2 X .
 Lemma 6. Let X = { x 1 ,x 2 , ... ,x m } be an itemset in database D, for an integer m P 1. Then,
X ={ x 1 , x 2 }. Then, S X h { x i }, D i = S ({ x i }, D ) S ({ x is true for m = p . We shall prove that the result is true for m = p + 1. Let X ={ x following observations are made. S ({ x i } \ { x p +1 }, D ) is required to be subtracted, for 1 required to be added, for 1 6 i &lt; j 6 p . Finally, the term ( 1) Thus, the induction step follows. Hence, the result follows. h Lemma 7 expresses association among items of X in terms of supports of different subsets of X . Lemma 7. Let X = { x 1 ,x 2 , ... ,x m } be an itemset in database D, for m P 2. Then
Proof. We state the theorem of total probability [14] as follows. For any m events x Result follows using Lemmas 3 and 6.
 Corollary L7.1 Corollary L7.2. For m = 3, A 2 (X, D) = E 1 /E 2 , where measure A 1 .

Lemma 8. Let X be an itemset in database D. Then the measure of association A (i) 0 &lt; A 1 (X,D) 6 1, (ii) A 1 (X,D) 6 A 1 (Y,D), for Y # X, and j Y j P 2, and (iii) A
Proof (i) A 1 ( X , D ) &gt; 0, since S ( X , D ) &gt; 0. Also, A (ii) Let X ={ x 1 , x 2 , ... , x m }. We consider an itemset Y # X such that j Y j P 2. Then, A (iii) A 1  X  X ; D  X  X  S  X  X ; D  X  = S  X [ x i 2 X f x i g ; D  X  P S  X  X ; D  X  P a , since 0 &lt; S ( [ 4.1. Capturing association among items in X becomes low. Instead of that, we could have estimated association among items in X using A ference in similarity using measure A 2 could be estimated as DS ( X , D )= A 1 6 0, if k =2[ Corollary D12.1 ]. 5. An application: clustering frequent items in a database in a given database using A 2 .
 greater than 2, one might cluster frequent items in a database with higher degree of accuracy, since A tational complexity is concerned. 6. Experimental results the purpose of verifying results. We present some characteristics of these databases in Table 1 . easy to implement.
 6.1. Top associative itemsets among frequent itemsets Top 10 associative itemsets among frequent itemsets in these databases are given in Tables 2 X 4 . cantly high. On the other hand, the items in random500 and random1000 databases are sparsely distributed. 6.2. Finding the difference in similarity purpose of comparison, we take similarity measure sim 1 ( x associative itemsets along with their difference in similarities are given in Tables 5 X 7 . items in these itemsets are not significant. 6.3. Execution time for measuring association the size of a database increases. We observe this phenomenon in Figs. 1 X 5 . 7. Conclusion in Section 5.
 we show that A 2 measures association among items in an itemset more accurately than A ference in similarity among a set of items obtained using measure A tained using an existing similarity measure. Thus, a solution of a problem obtained using measure A The measure of association A 2 is effective in capturing statistical association among items in a database.
