 1. Introduction
This special issue gathers extended versions of papers presented at the Sixth International Conference on Business Pro-cess Management (BPM 2008), held in Milan, Italy, September 2 X 4, 2008. Over the years, the BPM conference series has grown from a rather small gathering of 80 X 100 specialists, to a premier forum that attracts over 200 participants and covers a wide range of topics across the entire lifecycle of business processes.

In this edition of the conference, we received 154 full paper submissions from 36 countries. After a thorough refereeing process in which every paper was reviewed by 3 to 5 program committee members, 23 papers were accepted. Following the 2. Papers in this special issue
This special issue covers the following areas of business process management: semantics and analysis of process models, process simulation, and process execution.

In the first paper,  X  X  X rocess Instantiation X , Decker and Mendling examine alternative ways to define the instantiation semantics of process models, particularly in the context of languages in which the models may have multiple start events. The framework defines the instantiation of process models in terms of four concepts: Creation, Activation, Subscription, and Unsubscription. The framework is applied to characterize six process modeling languages with respect to their process instantiation semantics. This analysis leads to the conclusion that mappings between process modeling languages (e.g. BPMN and BPEL) need to deal with discrepancies in their instantiation semantics. The framework is also used to analyze dif-ferent types of errors found in real-world process models due to a misunderstanding of the underpinning instantiation semantics by modelers.
 In the second paper, Vanhatalo et al. define a canonical representation of process models, namely the  X  X  X efined Process Structure Tree X  (RPST). The RPST of a process model is a hierarchy of sub-processes, each with a single entry and a single exit point. In addition to a mathematical definition of the RPST, the authors provide an algorithm to efficiently construct the RPST of a process model. The authors prove that, in addition to being unique, the RPST decomposition is modular. bidirectional transformations between process models (e.g. between BPMN and BPEL process models), to pinpoint changes in process models, or to identify errors in process models and to automatically correct these errors in a local manner. The third paper,  X  X  X eciding Service Composition and Substitutability Using Extended Operating Guidelines X  by Stahl and Wolf, investigates some open issues in the field of service protocol analysis. Specifically, the paper defines a mathematical framework for characterizing all correctly interacting partners of a given service. Based on this framework, the authors the place of service B without creating deadlocks?).
 Next, Rozinat et al. propose an integrated approach that seamlessly links workflow execution with workflow simulation. The authors show how to automatically construct simulation models that combine design-time information (workflow mod-els, organizational models) with runtime data (execution logs and workflow state data). By incorporating runtime data into simulation models, it becomes possible to run accurate simulations on-the-fly (while the workflow is under execution) in order to understand how the workflow will evolve in a given time horizon (e.g. few hours or few days), considering its cur-rent state and its recent history. The described concepts are implemented in a tool chain, built on top of the YAWL workflow system and the ProM process analysis tool.

In the final paper,  X  X  X ESTful Web Service Composition with BPEL for REST X , the author proposes an extension of the BPEL standard in order to support the composition of RESTful Web services. On the one hand, this extension adds new constructs to BPEL that enable the invocation of RESTful Web Services. On the other hand, it enables the publication of BPEL processes as RESTful Web services. Given the de facto co-existence of SOAP-based Web services and RESTful Web services, this paper constitutes a valuable addition to the existing body of research results supporting the BPEL standard.


It is a pleasure for us to present this special issue of Data and Knowledge Engineering comprising of the best contributions presented at the 7th International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM 2009). The conference took place in Ulm, Germany, September 8-10, 2009, and was organized by the Institute of Databases and Information Systems of the University of Ulm. The BPM conference series has the ambition to be the premier forum for researchers in the area of process-aware of business process management including theory, frameworks, methods, techniques, architectures, and empirical fi ndings.
BPM 2009 featured sessions on process modeling, veri fi cation and compliance of processes, processes and services, management of processes, and process mining. The program of BPM 2009 consisted of three keynote presentations by highly reputed researchers, 17 contributed research papers, and two contributed industrial papers selected from a total of 116 submissions from 31 countries. The thorough reviewing process  X  each paper was reviewed by three to fi ve program committee members  X  was extremely competitive as the acceptance rate of 16% indicates. The best papers were selected after the conference, extended and carefully revised, and then came under scrutiny of another thorough review. Henceforth, the four papers in this special issue are the fi nal result of an intensive quality assurance and improvement process.
 The fi rst article,  X  Mining Business Process Variants: Challenges, Scenarios, Algorithms" by Chen Li, Manfred Reichert, and Andreas Wombacher addresses the problems induced by con fi guration changes and runtime variations of process instances for process mining. The paper introduces two scenarios for learning from process model adaptions and for mining a reference model for processes, which can be used to con fi gure process variants with a minimal effort.
 In the second paper, "Hierarchical Aggregation of Service Level Agreements", Irfan Ul Haq, Altaf Ahmad Huqqani, and Erich Schikuta analyze the requirements for hierarchical aggregation of service level agreements, which are necessary for the automation of service composition. They propose a technique to aggregate SLAs, as de fi ned at various levels of the hierarchy, to ensure the expected quality of the composed service for different stakeholders.
 The third paper, "Analysis on Demand: Instantaneous Soundness Checking of Industrial Business Process Models" by Dirk Fahland, Cedric Favre, Jana Koehler, Niels Lohmann, Hagen V X lzer, and Karsten Wolf, presents a case study where 735 industrial business process models from different domains have been checked for soundness with three popular tools. As one of their fi ndings, they conclude that the effort of applying these tools is so small that soundness checking can be tightly integrated into process modeling environments.
 Finally, in the fourth article "Symbolic Abstraction and Deadlock-Freeness Veri fi cation of Inter-Enterprise Processes", Kais Klai, Samir Tata, and J X rg Desel study the problem of proving the correctness of modularly composed processes. They propose a veri fi cation technique based on symbolic observation graphs, which do not rely on the internal structure of the components.
This is the place to express our gratitude to all those who made BPM 2009 and this special issue possible by generously and voluntarily sharing their knowledge, skills and time: the general chairs Peter Dadam and his team for providing an excellent environment for the conference. We are grateful to Peter P. Chen, Editor in-in-Chief of Data and Knowledge Engineering for accepting our proposal for this special issue, and Jie Chen, publishing content coordinator at Elsevier, for her skillful helpand guidance during the production of this special issue. We thank the senior and regular program committee members, as well as the additional reviewers for devoting their expertise and time to ensure the high quality of the conference by the extensive review and discussion process they participated in. And, last but not least, we are grateful to all the authors who showed their appreciation of BPM by submitting their valuable work to it.
