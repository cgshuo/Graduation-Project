 This issue of LRE is comprised of two special sections: one consisting of papers from the 2010 LREC , including a keynote speech by Ralf Steinberger, and the other on the topic of interoperability and including papers from the 2010 International Conference on Global Interoperability. The latter includes an introduction providing a rationale and overview of the selected papers.

After seven years of publication of Language Resources and Evaluation , we are proud to say that the journal X  X  success is well established. The number and the quality of submissions are constantly increasing, together with requests to edit special issues dedicated to topics of current interest to the field. As a result of the efforts of reviewers and authors, LRE has become one of the most highly respected journals in the field, indexed in the ISI/Science Citation Index since 2009 and increasing steadily in impact.

Because of the growing interest and high quality of work in the field, we have negotiated an increase in the number of journal pages per annual volume in order to accommodate additional papers. We are also are exploring with Springer the possibility of providing an online only publication for certain types of articles X  X or example, annotation guidelines that accompany a paper or report, which would ensure persistence and citability as well as provide a means for scholarly recognition of development of this kind of material.

We are also striving to ensure that the journal addresses the range of activities relevant to language resource development and evaluation. To this end, starting in 2013, the journal will include two major sections, one treating research and innovation and the other devoted to the detailed description of a given resource or process. The aim is to provide, on the one hand, a venue for papers that contribute to the advancement of methodologies for resource development, evaluation, and use, and on the other, a venue for papers that focus on resource development processes, descriptive information and rationale, substantive evaluation statistics, resource development in specific languages, etc. Because LRE is the only journal in the field that publishes papers in the latter category, we feel it is critical to explicitly recognize papers falling within it in order to underscore their viability as significant scholarly contributions. At the same time, we continue to encourage submission of papers that are aimed at improving methodologies and developing innovative approaches to resource development, evaluation, and their use to advance natural language processing capabilities. We will continue to publish short notes, perspective pieces, and book reviews in the journal as well.

Another important event is that LRE will now become the first journal to join forces with the LRE Map initiative to monitor the use and creation of language resources and tools. It is well recognized that accurate and reliable documentation is the gateway to discovery of language resources and a necessary step towards promoting data economy. Language resources that are not documented virtually do not exist: for this reason FLaReNet and ELRA jointly launched the LRE Map at LREC 2010, as an initiative able to collect and harmonize metadata about resources. The LRE Map of resource creation and use will be not only informative, but also useful for funders and resource providers as a tool for measuring and monitoring various dimensions of resource development and use across places and times. The Map will also reveal trends in language resource use and related language technology development by cataloguing not only language resources, but also tools, standards, and annotation guidelines. The Map is freely available for consultation at http://www.resourcebook.eu/ .

Since its initiation, the LRE Map has been adopted by a number of major conferences in the field of computational linguistics, language technology and language resources. Now, all authors who submit to LRE will be asked to provide information about the resources and tools they reference or describe X  X hether new or previously existing X  X n the submitted article. Given that LRE is the premier venue for journal publication concerning resource development and use, informa-tion provided by those who submit to the journal should enable the Map to cover a significant portion of the field X  X  activity.

We would like to thank all of those who have contributed to the journal, including LRE board members and reviewers, authors and guest editors, and the language resources community as a whole. We very much look forward to working with you in the future to provide a premier journal for the language resources community.
