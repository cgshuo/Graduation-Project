 1. Introduction 1.1. Rationale for the study
After the senior investigator had joined a small business in Washington, Tyne and Wear, UK as a computer systems administrator he observed the computer system was dormant. The system was shut down because the organization lacked the technical skills needed to manage it and could not afford the fees charged by IT consultants. The system had accounting, inventory and order processing modules. Following reactivation of the system it was used in the offices with information being moved to the factory floor by paper and verbal formats. This created the inherent possibility of misunderstanding and wrong interpretation.

With the advancement in technology the collection, organization and management of production information on factory floor is achieved through automation. Automation has limitations which Menendez and Tanner (2008) identify because tion Haftl (2009) observes that every human activity can be automated to a certain degree to improve efficiency irrespective of the number of employees. This is most relevant to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which are advised by Richlin (2008)  X  not to automate more than necessary and Sharma and Ali (2010) recommend an incremental approach. In conclusion automa-tion is used for information management on factory floor in conjunction with manual information systems which handle non-digitized production information.

The outworking of the  X  X  X arriage X  X  of digitized and non-digitized information systems in the production process has not been investigated. The question is:  X  X  X ow can digitized and non-digitized information systems which are traditionally incom-patible be integrated in a single architecture and represented by a common nomenclature and measure for the purposes of studying the phenomenon of information use? X  X  The second question is:  X  X  X s there synergy in the integration that is strategic in relation to information load and usability? X  X  The study is important to the industry because it adds to the knowledge of production information collection, organization and management on factory floor where digitized and non-digitized infor-mation are used interchangeably. The study will investigate the strategic combination (or not) of digitized and non-digitized information use which is applicable to factory floor information system. 1.2. Objective The objective is to investigate the impact of information use architecture on load and usability on factory floor.
Information use architecture describes the organization, identification and location of the information use elements that constitute the value stream. Analogous to Brandt and Boynton X  X  (1991) description of information systems architecture, information use architecture formats can be described as federated and integrated. In the same manner integrated informa-tion use architecture can be described as built around one type of information use format and the major features include the ease of access, ease of restructuring the information use and high efficiency coming from the use of a common information use format. The issues with integrated structure stem mainly from cost and low flexibility ( Brandt &amp; Boynton, 1991 ). Fed-erated information use architecture links different information use formats when needed to provide meaning and under-standing of an event. The main features are flexibility and the application of digitized and non-digitized information in an event without having to change their formats in the process. The issues with federated information use architecture are inef-ficiency, information use integrity and the difficulty of maintenance ( Brandt &amp; Boynton, 1991 ).

Information load is a complex construct that aligns the quantity, variety and multi-faceted nature of information in rela-tion to human processing capability ( Weick, 1995 ). Analogous to Weick X  X  (1995) definition of information load, information use load can be described as an indication of the quantity, variety and complexity of the nature and format of the information use value flow in relation to that necessary for executing the task. The definition is an extension of Weick (1995) because it takes into account the format and flow of information which are necessary for the study of information use and it makes the term  X  X  X nformation load X  X  applicable to artefacts and events as information users in addition to humans. Unlike Weick X  X  (1995) definition of information load which focuses on the human processing capacity, information use load focuses on properties inherent in information and it is measured by the number of the stages of transformation of information format which the information has to undergo with or without the involvement of humans before it can be used in executing the task ( Okike, 2010 ). In the study information use load is measured in relation to the number and type of encoding/decoding of information use from one format and nature to another in relation to the number of nodes used in the encoding/decoding exercise ( Appendix A ). The number of times a piece of information is recoded and the number of nodes involved are obtained from the information use architecture.

Information usability is defined in line with the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) 9241. The usability of a product is defined by ISO 9241 as  X  X  X he extent to which the product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals The dimensions, indicators, empirical referents and measures of the terms are operationalized in Appendix A , Table A3 Although the standards are formulated mainly in relation to the development of software as a product it is applicable to information because both have a common root. Karmarkar and Apte (2007) argue the concept of IT department as manufac-turer of information goods and services. Information goods include packaged pure information like books and software and can be priced in units and delivered as physical entities or through electronic channels. Information services may not be packaged or inventoried and are produced and consumed at the same time. While information goods are produced for an established market, information services are produced for internal use. Scholtz X  X  (2004) approach to the standards is appli-cable to the study where the product is information for internal use and the context of use is the manufacturing production process on factory floor. 1.3. The concept of information use node
Information use nodes are conceptualized basic building blocks in information use architecture which impact information use load and usability ( Okike, 2010 ). The concept of the node is multi-functional. A node can function as a sub-system for information processing and communication. It can have the characteristics of information use like digitized and non-digi-tized (tacit, mechanical and paper) formats. Tacit information assumes the forms of know-how, expertise, skill and routines which are difficulty to communicate through formal computer networks. Mechanical information includes information re-layed by actuators, recorders and data loggers. An actuator is a mechanical device which is used to control a system and it assumes the form of pneumatic, hydraulic and electric actuators and human muscles. A node can represent one or more artifacts, humans, machines or media. It can function as a store for information use e.g. information source and feedback store and at the same time it can be a transmitter of same e.g. medium for information use input into the system and out put from the system. It can be applied as a tool for managing information use. For example nodes can be structured in a cer-tain way as to produce integrated or federated architecture and explicit or implicit feedback. It can encode and decode infor-mation to make it meaningful and fit for the purpose for which it is being applied. It determines the quality of information use by producing correct, current and timely information use. It is capable of learning and memorizing information use data, handle errors and thereby impact information use load and usability. It can acquire the skills of an expert or a novice in the function of encoding or decoding information use, error handling and information learnability and memorability. The dimen-sions, attributes and values in relation to the node are represented in Appendix A , Table A2 . 2. Literature review on information use on factory floor The literature review covers two main areas of the title: information characteristics and information use on factory floor.
A fundamental knowledge of the characteristics of information is necessary in order to understand and model how digitized and non-digitized information work together as a single architecture. This involves the exposition of the nature, format, function and operation of information characteristics and the manner of application in literature. The knowledge is applied in a critical review of literature about information use on factory floor and the development of information use theoretical framework.

Information is defined differently based on the relationship with knowledge and the need to foster meaning. From an operational perspective, information is a set of relevant, accurate, timely, and concise processed data which depend on both the receiver and sender ( Karmarkar &amp; Apte, 2007 ). In a similar operational definition data includes everything which can be sensed by humans and can be represented by a symbol representing a label and a value ( Barham, 2004 ). Information consists of data and descriptions and provides meaning and measure ( Hicks, Culley, Allen, &amp; Mullineux, 2002 ). Categories of informa-tion include textual, pictorial, verbal, (formal), memory, and expression (informal). The attributes of information include commoditization, value, reliability of content, reliability of source, timeliness, general/specific application, subject domain,
Hubert-Miller (2006) offers three postulates which attempt to answer the questions of what, why and how information is formed. He concludes that information is a thing because it has content, and its main purpose is to convey meaning which is achieved by bringing together content, communication and context in an event ( Arbogast de Hubert-Miller, 2006 ). Hicks (2007) contextualized information value in the engineering environment to mean the perceived value of information user who is regarded as the customer. Information value stream represents the processes which are necessary to produce infor-mation and can occur in several sequential steps known as information flow. The format, time and sequence of the flow are determined by the user X  X  demands (customer pull) ( Hicks, 2007 ).

The issue of information codification and personalization is raised in Tang, Zhao, Austin, Darlington, and Culley (2010) study of the aerospace and construction industries. The purpose of the codification is to enable the organizations in selecting which information is important and should be in the storage in order to reduce information overload. The authors classified knowledge and information practices into software, hardware and criticalware. Criticalware denotes the knowledge and information in people and it consists of specialists and socialization activities that make the systems work. The need to cod-ify personal tacit knowledge is identified in Tang et al. (2010) for the purpose of storage and reuse. Information is valued based on the relevance, impact, costs, currency, usability, accuracy and trust and by applying Bayesian decision-making net-work model. Tang et al. (2010) recommends a checklist for information handling which includes: attention to the legal requirements of the sector, storage cost of information, using tags to discriminate between important and unimportant information, the value of the information and the extent and scope of information to be recorded. Tang et al. X  X  (2010) study is at the strategic level, does not take all information formats into consideration and does not discuss the handling of per-sonal tacit knowledge in any detail. Hence the terminologies are related to humans as information users without regard for artefacts that use information. The issues are addressed in the current study.

Literature about information use on factory floor has focused on ERP 3 and factory floor automation at the strategic and operational levels respectively. The studies on ERP concentrate on the development ( Ghahramani &amp; Wang, 1998 ), management
ERP implementation ends when the system goes live and is handed over to the process owner. At this point the system has been son, 1999 ). On the contrary Hershfield (1992) considers the support and monitoring activity as integral to implementation and
Sun, Yazdani, and Overend (2005) include a cycle of improvements that never ended. The studies on ERP implementation tend to suggest that ERP is used to plan the production but ERP does not have the capability to execute the plan on the factory floor.
Computer software can be used on factory floor to run the business and/or run the machines ( Haftl, 2008 ). Real-time data on factory floor are integrated with ERP through automated systems such as robotics and CNC 4 -machines. There are two ap-proaches to automated systems in manufacturing: manufacturing intelligence system (MIS) and manufacturing execution sys-tem (MES) ( Henderson, 2009 ). MIS integrates the data from the factory floor with ERP system and measures the performance of the production lines and plants against standard metrics. It enables the identification of non-performing processes which are examined using MES. MES allows users to specify materials, equipment and the sequence of the required production process. The main objective of MES is to facilitate improvement in production including the process sequence, introduction of measures towards lean manufacturing, real-time accounting and operator retraining. Although MES has produced significant production efficiencies and cost savings through managing production lifecycle stages on factory floor from materials requisition to the shipment of finished products, it has failed to bridge the communication gap. Since MES is a digitized information system, it does not collect, organize, and manage all production information ( Menendez &amp; Tanner, 2008 ) most of which is still managed manually. In a study of the 10 best machine shops in USA Haftl (2008, 2009) observes non-machining operations like keeping records of what a machinist has done can be automated by using barcodes and a hand-held barcode reader and factory floor scheduling can be developed using Excel software. The methods are used to track factory floor activities including process com-pletion stages, material flow, and inventory control and tool usage.

Regulations for data assembly and exchange on the factory floor are at the developmental stages. For example Interna-tional Society of Automation X  X  S95 (Manufacturing Enterprise Systems Standards), S99 (Manufacturing and Control Systems Security) standards, and OMAC (Organization for Machine Automation and Control) standards, aim at establishing best prac-tices in factory floor data management. 2.1. Research gap
The impact of information use on the manufacturing process has not been fully explored in literature. The reason is that literature tends to adopt strategic and dichotomous approaches to information use on factory floor. The studies are mainly about ERP and factory floor automation which involve digitized information use. Information user in literature is restricted to humans and terms are defined in relation to human capacity to process information. The dichotomous approach does not represent the reality of information use in the manufacturing process that involves machines, operators and production pro-cedures which are in constant exchange of digitized and non-digitized information with each other during the manufactur-ing process. The approach does not collect, organize, and manage all production information most of which is still managed manually. The codification of information and knowledge management in operations in literature is at the strategic level, it does not consider all information formats and the storage of personal tacit knowledge is not represented in any detail. The outworking of the coexistence of digitized and non-digitized information systems on factory floor and the implication for the manufacturing process have not been researched. Regulations for data assembly and exchange on the factory floor are at the developmental stages. The current study addresses the gap in research. 3. Discussion 3.1. Framework
The theories from the literature review can be summarized as relationships between information characteristics, context and effectiveness. The relationships are represented in the theoretical framework Fig. 1 . The framework consists of three in-ter-related blocks of variables that can affect information use in the manufacturing production process which defines the unit of analysis. One block consists of information characteristics, another block shows the areas of possible impact of the characteristics and a third block consists of the contexts in manufacturing. Information characteristics that are considered in the report are information format, nature, architecture, usability and load. The dimensions, indicators, empirical referents and measures of the terms are operationalized in Appendix A .

The roadmap to the framework is presented in the information use architecture. The construction and development of information use architecture are described in the case studies. 3.2. Method
The research method is shaped by the research objective which is to investigate the impact of information use architec-ture on load and usability on factory floor. The case study method is adopted because it is common in SME ethnographic studies and it can support a joint analysis of digitized and non-digitized information use, attention to context and daily prac-tices as well as detailed analysis of concepts ( Hill &amp; McGowan, 1999 ) which are necessary for the study. A purposive sam-pling method is used in selecting four SMEs that apply digitized and non-digitized information in the manufacturing production process. The number of organizations is considered adequate for a meaningful multi-case study and cross-case analysis. The sample includes one micro-size organization, two small-size and one medium-size organizations. One case the production is run by one operator and in another case the production is divided into several workstations and each work-station is run by a team of operators. One of the cases does not apply digitized information and the other cases apply dig-itized information at different levels. The types of products that are represented by the sample include surgical precision tools and concrete paving products. Production procedures that are represented include parts production, assembly and quality control which constitute the major production activities on factory floor.

The study adopts Zhang, Basili, and Shneiderman (1998) perspective-based approach to information use where the user can be a machine, an event or human. Three perspectives of information use that are considered are novice use, expert use and error handling. Zhang et al. X  X  (1998) data collection method for the perspective-based approach to usability is adopted.
The method entails the identification of a set of information for each task in the production process and data gathering about the recognized information through observation and interview of user. In the study data collection is through semi-struc-tured interviews with the manager and operator respectively, observation of the work process and the production docu-ments. The epistemology of the study recognizes that people X  X  knowledge and experiences are interpretive and can be view technique is used because it is flexible and recognizes the individuality of interviewees in their understanding of the phenomenon ( Gubrium &amp; Holstein, 2003 ) and the author who is the interviewer can adapt the approach (e.g. language, se-quence, process) to reflect the same perspectives as the interviewee. This is crucial in the study of information use where interpretations of terminology can differ from one person to another.
 Data about information use format and load are obtained by the observation of the production process and environment. the researcher playing the role is that the researcher loses the practical experience of the phenomenon and emotional feel-ings of being at the receiving end. This raises the concern of how far non-experiential knowledge could be classified as knowledge. The concern is addressed by the fact that the researcher has worked in similar manufacturing environments and can relate to the type of experiential knowledge and emotions that are common to the engineering production process. The dimensions, indicators, empirical referents and measures of the terms are operationalized in Appendix A , Table A3 .
The deductively-based analytical procedure described by Yin (2003) is applied in the study which utilizes pattern match-ing and explanation building. Huberman and Miles X  X  (1994) data reduction and display methods are applied. For example interviews, observations and documents are summarized and categorized for ease of comparison. Site visits are analyzed on a contact summary sheet ( Appendix B ). Data is organized in cases which are code-named and the emphasis is on the dis-tinctiveness of each case in relation to an issue or topic of investigation. Thematic analysis and diagrams are applied in the identification of the common factors. The interpretations of cross-tabulations are applied in the analysis of information use characteristics. A comparison of the cases is used to highlight the variety and common traits in the organizations with regard to information use. The data are analyzed at three levels: information use architecture, information use load and information usability. The correctness of the data is confirmed by the interviewee before application in data analysis. 3.2.1. Validity and reliability of the study
One of the shortfalls of the qualitative approach is the subjectivity that is introduced through the constructs and indicators used to represent latent traits like behavior and experience and the application of data gathering techniques such as inter-viewing and observation. Douglass and Johnson (1997) and Kotarba and Fontana (1984) argue that knowledge could not be acquired through participation and observation from the point of view that people can be emotional and irrational and therefore prone to fronting. In recognition of the issues the author of the current study concentrates on utterances and con-stantly questions his assumptions. Denzin and Lincoln (2000) recognize reflexivity and subjectivity as imperatives in social research. Subjectivity is minimized in the current study by a reflexive discussion of the ethnic perspectives of the author regarding SMEs. Because of the author X  X  experience concerning the exploitation of a small business in Tyne and Wear UK by IT consultants, there is the possibility of subjective treatment of issues relating to SME and IT. In order to minimize sub-jectivity, terms and concepts that are applied in the current study corroborate the standard vocabulary with an application to information use. Assumptions are justified by literature. Data is interpreted in the context of each setting or case, generaliz-floor of the cases rather than a deduction based on causality. The correctness of the data in each instance is confirmed by the interviewee before application in data analysis. This approach helps to minimize interviewer bias. Subjectivity in data gath-ering is minimized through triangulation. Since all observations and measures are prone to errors, the study places particular emphasis on multiple observations and measures ( Richards, 2008 ). The study makes use of observation and production doc-the author X  X  thoughts and intentions in text analysis is addressed by applying Burnett, Dickey, Coduba, and Kazmer (2003) cultural hermeneutics. The analysis of the text is based on the interpretation of the main contextual considerations of infor-mation use architecture, load and usability. The concern of how far non-experiential knowledge could be classified as knowl-edge is addressed in the study by the fact that the author has worked in similar manufacturing environments and can relate to the type of experiential knowledge that is common to the engineering production process. The validity of data analysis is ad-dressed in the study through inter-case analysis, the application of common terms and measures across the cases which in-creases comparability, and the recognition of dominant patterns using a ranking system.

The subjectivity inherent in the purposive sampling technique adopted in the study is minimized by the selection of orga-nizations with differences in their production process, level of computerization of the factory floor and SIC. The sample rep-resents the complete range of SME categories (micro, small and medium) and the main production activities on the factory floor (parts production, assembly and quality control). The variations in the participant organizations and the scope of the diversity of the contexts represented in the sample tend to support analytical generalization to some broader theory. A com-parison of some of the findings with literature leaned towards evidence for generalization within the boundaries of the re-search. For example the study shows that the organizations applied mostly non-digitized information in manufacturing and that computerization is carried out in stages which supports Ferman X  X  (1999) and Olhager and Selldin X  X  (2003) findings regarding SMEs.

Construct validity is established in the study by relating the construct to a similar meaning in literature. For example con-structs such as information use load, interoperatability, usability and reusability are similar in meaning to interoperability, usability and reusability common in information and knowledge literature. The indicators of the constructs are standard for-mats used in literature which suggests they are proven to be convergent and the application supports convergent validity. Subjectivity is minimized by quantifying the measures. The data corroborate the findings in literature which is evidence to the correct operationalization of the constructs. For example the higher the number of decoding/encoding the higher the de-mand on human processing capacity and the higher the load which corroborates Weick (1995) . Where fronting by partici-pants is suspected it is made known and the author has advised that the data be viewed with caution. The reliability of the measuring instrument or procedure is increased in the study by the application of a semi-structured interview technique. The observation of the production process and the operator is recorded in a standard format to ensure similar aspects of pro-duction activities are measured in each case using the same instrument. The procedure for measuring load on the production process is based on the characteristics of information use and not on the processing capacity of human beings which can change depending on circumstances. The research methods are critiqued by three experienced researchers who are members of the advisory panel for the study.

There are short comings which cannot be overcome in the study. The purposive sampling method which is adopted in the study is inherently subjective. Although the sample is heterogeneous it does not have maximum variation. For example all the levels of computerization on shop floor are not represented. The outcome of the study may be affected and Patton X  X  (2002) argument about the strength of purposive sampling which is based on sample heterogeneity may not be realized. The interviews are sometimes carried out with irregular breaks when the operator or manager has to attend to a call of duty. This means that the interviews are not executed exactly in a similar fashion which can affect the outcome and the basis for comparison ( Berg, 2009 ). The issue of fronting cannot be totally ruled out especially where the participant is either nomi-nated by the organization or the participant is the only operator of the machine as in Case A and Case B respectively. In such instances the outcome of the interview is traceable to the participant which can make the participant apprehensive of a pos-sible reprisal if the organization is portrayed in bad light. Fronting is encouraged by the researcher playing the role of par-ticipant observer which is the method adopted in the study. Mason (2007) presents the dilemma of participant observer to be the attempt to generate data and at the same time influencing the dynamics of the data. It is difficult to ascertain whether the researcher as participant observer enabled data excavation or the construction of knowledge in the current study. 3.3. Case A
Case A manufactures refrigerated and curtain-sider trailers. The company adopts ERP in a piecemeal manner which sup-ports Ferman X  X  (1999) findings and priority is given to management modules and production control which is in line with Olhager and Selldin X  X  (2003) findings. The operation on factory floor is labor intensive and does not support any of Veilleux and Petro X  X  (1998) hierarchical order of factory computerization. 3.3.1. Case A X  X  information use architecture
Fig. 2 shows the information use architecture applicable to Case A. The assembly plant process consists of eight proce-dures/tasks which occur in the following order: chassis alignment, bolting, sub-assembly quality control, construction of trailer body, welding the body panels together, systems (cooling, break and lighting) installation, door installation and final quality control. There are 22 groupings of information and 40 nodes are involved in the communication and application of the information to tasks. Paper, tacit, mechanical and digitized information are applied and tacit information use is applied in all of the eight procedures of the tasks. To execute a task requires specific information input into the production process and feedback. The format of the information source, input and feedback is critical to information load and usability in production where humans and machines are engaged. For example the chassis alignment procedure in Case A requires information about the type, size and quantity of parts and the procedure which are provided in the production schedule and standard operating procedures (SOPs) on paper (Node 9). The operator assimilates the information and inputs it in the process as tacit information (Node 17) which is used in aligning the chassis. Feedback is in the form of operator experience which has a tacit format (Node 17) and is stored on paper (Node 9). Information about the relative positions of the parts is in the form of engi-neering drawing on paper (Node 1). The information is input in the production process by the use of jigs which mirror the positions on the drawing and the parts are deemed to be aligned when they fit into the jigs. The approach represents a mechanical format of input information (Node 18) of the positions. The feedback from the system has a mechanical format. The operator receives the feedback by observing the fitness between the parts and the jigs and records the findings on paper (Node 1). The source of the information and the record of the feedback are not necessarily located on the same paper as Fig. 2 tends to suggest. The rest of the architecture can be explained in a similar way. 3.3.2. Case A X  X  information load Table 1 represents Case A X  X  information load which is constructed with data from the information use architecture ( Fig. 2 ). The flow of information use is impacted by the number of information recoding which is a major contributor to load and error. The organization has a relatively efficient information use as demonstrated by the availability of information, indexing of instruction sheets and minimal occurrence of situations of conflicting information. The ability to operate efficiently at such a high level of information load can be attributed to two factors: work teams and the application of a dedicated telephone line called ANDON, which links the factory floor with the rest of the organization for the purposes of a quick sourcing of information which otherwise will cause a delay in production. One of the advantages of working in a team is the availability of collective experience and skills which contribute to timely encoding and decoding of information formats.

Load level is described as low, medium or high. 5 The level of load is low when the number of decoding/encoding is 2 or less, medium when it is 3 and high when it is 4 per task. The organization has a medium/high level of information use load. The load is bourn by the team of operators which reduces the impact on each operator. Novice information users work side by side with experienced workers and learning takes place by doing, mentoring and discussion on the job. The operators are satisfied with the different information formats (mechanical jigs, meters, SOPs in text and pictures and color coded tools). The load with re-spect to bolting and systems quality control has reached the maximum of 4 and a further addition of tasks will necessitate an increase in the number of nodes else information overload will result. 3.3.3. Case A X  X  information usability
Case A X  X  information usability is represented in Table 2 . The data are obtained by considering the information content and load per node and for each task. For example sources of information used in the chassis alignment task are job card, engi-neering drawing, SOP and instruction manuals, all of which have paper format. Users found engineering drawing more dif-ficult to learn than manuals in text format. SOPs with elucidating photographs are the easiest source of information to understand. The application of jigs can be complicated for a novice who has to work out the positioning of the parts with respect to the jigs. The workers relied very much on experience and are satisfied with the way tacit information is used. Specifications of the parts and how each part is to be aligned is obtained from the job card, engineering drawing and SOPs separately and it is consistent most of the time. Where there are discrepancies they are resolved by applying the collective experience of the team or by seeking expert advice via ANDON. Information that is applied in bolting the parts can be learned and memorized by a novice while an expert is required to achieve the same level of learnability and memorability in the case of quality control of the systems.
 3.3.4. Summary Case A Case A has medium/high information use load and mixed expert/novice usability depending on the architecture ( Table 3 ).
The corporate experience of computerization, team work and the application of ANDON hotline have produced an environ-ment where a high user satisfaction is possible with the presence of a medium/high information load. The attributes of infor-mation use learnability and memorability which can be identified at the expert and novice levels are independent of the level of load but are affected by the consistency of the knowledge level at the node. For example expert memorability seems to demand an expert learnability. The same applies to the novice level. 3.4. Case B
Case B manufactures plastic stamps which are used by crafters to make impressions. Communication of production infor-mation is verbal. The organization has a small manufacturing outfit which consists of a few manually operated machines run by one operator. 3.4.1. Case B X  X  information use architecture
Fig. 3 represents the architecture of Case B X  X  information use. The value process is hot-pressing which consists of four pro-cedures/tasks: material formatting, heating, pressing and quality control. Information use architecture for Case B contains 13 pieces of information which are communicated through 22 encoder/decoder nodes. Because one operator is involved in the process most of the sources of information and feedback are tacit. The operator retrieves information about the type of mate-rial and dimensions of the product from memory (Node 5) and inputs the information in the process mechanically by select-ing the appropriate bakelite form plate (Node 10). Similarly the process procedure is communicated to the system tacitly when the operator executes the task manually. The feedback is mechanically determined by a comparison of the product dimensions with the standard form plate (Node 11) and the information is stored in the operator and constitutes experience.
The same approach is used in the execution of the rest of the tasks. Feedback is observed by the operator but not recorded in any way outside of the observer.
 3.4.2. Case B X  X  information use load
Case B X  X  information use load structure is represented in Table 4 which has been constructed based on the information terms of information use load and can be perceived as a case of relative information underload. 3.4.3. Case B X  X  information usability
The information usability is at the novice level. Information content for the formatting task is simple, easy to learn, apply and memorize. The possibility of an error is large because verbal communication is prone to misunderstanding and misin-terpretation and relies on the memory of the operator. A premium is placed on experience. The efficiency of information use is determined by the information load, timeliness, currency and correctness. Table 5 represents the usability attributes of
Case B. The simplicity of the operation can be the reason for 100% user satisfaction regarding the information use. The large possibility of errors corroborates the length of time to acquire the necessary skills. It takes six months before an acceptable level of proficiency can be attained by a new operator despite the simplicity of the tasks and information content. 3.4.4. Summary Case B
Case B is a typical mono-operator manufacturing business which has a protectionist tendency towards the process pro-cedures which are simple in terms of technology but require experience in the handling of rubber under heat and pressure. It exhibits a low information load and a high user satisfaction as expected. Table 6 represents a crosstabulation of Case B X  X  information use and the tasks. Integrated architecture tends to result in a low information use load. Federated architecture tends to result in both a high and low information use load. Information usability in the case of a mono-operator does not seem to discriminate between integrated and federated architecture. 3.5. Case C
The company produces concrete products and the production is automated to a large extent by the use of standalone computer controlled machines. Production information is on paper which is posted on a notice board. Processes are coded and information is fed to the machine by selecting a production code. Case C operates between levels 2 and 3 of the hierarchy of factory floor computerization ( Veilleux and Petro, 1998 ). The unit of investigation is the wet production process which consists of four tasks: aggregate mixing, casting, pressing and quality control. Digitized information from the computer net-work is applied to the tasks except quality control which applies information from quality manuals. Feedback is of two types: explicit meter reading and a digitized record in the computer system. There are very few instruction sheets and they are in the form of photographs of bad and good quality products. The sheets are not indexed. Labor input to the production process is minimal and restricted to three functions: typing the process code in the computer, carrying out quality control of the product and transporting the finished product from the machine to the store. 3.5.1. Case C X  X  Information use architecture
Information content and use in the wet process are represented in the information use architecture Fig. 4 . The wet press process involves 15 groups of information which are communicated through 20 nodes. Half of the total number of nodes have digitized format and the rest are either paper, mechanical or tacit information format. The process has four procedures and three of them apply digitized information. The application of digitized information in the procedures which involve a continuous material dosage, mixing, casting and pressing is typical of a continuous flow production process. The case has a mixture of integrated and federated architecture. For example information about material specifications and the mixer speed is communicated through nodes 5, 9 and 17 which apply one information format i.e. digitized information format. This is an example of integrated information use architecture. Other groups of nodes that exhibit a similar integrated architecture are 6, 11 and 18, and 7, 13 and 19. The rest exhibit federated architecture for each group of information use. Mixing speed and time have a digitized source and the feedback is both digitized and mechanical in the form of actuation meters. Mixing procedure is carried out using digitized information. Casting requires information about material dosage and dimension of the cast which have digitized and paper sources respectively (Nodes 6 and 2). The former is input and output in a digitized format and the latter in a mechanical format of a set volume. Pressure is applied to the cast using information from a dig-itized source (Node 7). The input and output format are digitized (Node 13). Output information about pressure and time is also displayed in actuation meters (Node 14) and stored tacitly (Node 3). The quality control requires information about material specifications and quality guidelines which are in paper format (pictures, SOPs) (Nodes 4 and 8) and which the operator puts in the process tacitly as the operator feels and observes the texture and dimensions of the product. The feed-back is witnessed only by the operator (Nodes 15 and 16) who records it in a paper format (Nodes 4 and 8). 3.5.2. Case C X  X  information use load
Case C X  X  information use load characteristics are represented in Table 7 which is constructed based on the information use architecture ( Fig. 4 ). The information use for each task goes through two encodings/decodings resulting in a low load. Labor is restricted to the quality control process and the recording of the feedback in some cases. This is an example of a balanced information use between digitized and non-digitized information. 3.5.3. Case C X  X  information usability
Table 8 represents information usability in Case C. Information about the aggregates and the duration of the mixing pro-cess is communicated to the mixer through a computer network and the same information can be communicated by select-ing a programme on the stand alone computer that is attached to the mixer on the factory floor. This constitutes a possible source of conflict of information. The selection of the computer programme which is based on the production schedule and reading the output in a meter do not require expert skills. The production automation has resulted in the involvement of labor on the factory floor at a level where a novice could do the work. Information user satisfaction is high which tends to reflect the low level of load. 3.5.4. Summary Case C
Table 9 represents a crosstabulation of the information use characteristics of Case C. The operations on the factory floor are highly digitized and manual labor is restricted to the quality control. Integrated information use architecture tends to support low information use load. Usability is at the novice level of information learnability and memorability which is inde-pendent of the architecture. 3.6. Case D The mode of business is sub-contract manufacture of medical devices. The main production process is injection molding. Manufacturing is carried out using stand-alone machines with a greater number of them being manually operated. The orga-nization is at Level 1 of Veilleux and Petro X  X  (1998) hierarchical order of factory computerization where machinery is con-trolled directly using rugged computers that stand on factory floor. The production schedule is developed on Excel spreadsheet and information about process procedure is communicated through instruction sheets and product route card. The plastic components of the products are produced in-house and the metallic components are outsourced.
 The process consists of six tasks: material dosage, heating, extrusion, quality control 1, assembly and quality control 2. There are two main communicators of information in this case: the operator and the stand-alone computers that control some of the machines. Material dosing and extrusion apply digitized information. The rest of the tasks source information from product route card, manuals, production schedule and meter reading. Feedback is given in both digitized and explicit forms, the former is for computer records and the latter is used by the operator to control the production. About 50% of the instruction sheets and manuals are indexed. 3.6.1. Case D X  X  information use architecture
Information use architecture for the injection molding process is represented in Fig. 5 . Information about the volume of granulates is on the route card (Node 7) and it is input in the system mechanically (Node 13) by applying a container with a pre-determined volume. The procedure is executed by making use of digitized information. Feedback on the quantity of granulates actually used up is obtained mechanically according to the level of the granulates in the container (Node 14). The level observation and the experience gained in executing the procedure are stored in the operator (Node 1). The gran-ulates are heated to a given temperature and time which are recorded on the product route card (Node 8) and input in the process using mechanical actuators (Node 15). Heating procedure is controlled by mechanical actuators which produce a feedback in the form of a temperature chart (Node 16). The feedback is observed and stored in the operator (Node 2). Infor-mation regarding the pressure to be applied in the extrusion is stored in a digitized source (Node 9) and input in the system in the same format (Node 17). The extrusion procedure is based on digitized information (Node 27) and feedback is in the form of number displays of pressure levels (Node 18). The guidelines on how to control the quality of the mold are in the SOP (Node 10). The information is input in the system tacitly (Nodes 19 and 28) as the operator checks the product for defects. Feedback is in the form of operator X  X  observations and experience (Node 20) and the feedback is stored in the operator (Node 4). Sub-assemblies and components are mounted on the mold to complete the product. Information about the components are obtained from the product route card and engineering drawings (Node 11) and input in the procedure by the operator (Node 21) through the act of assembling the products (Node 29). The final quality control makes use of information in a sim-ilar way as quality control 1. 3.6.2. Case D X  X  information use load
Case D has low information use load as demonstrated in Table 10 . It is fairly consistent in the application of information format. The low information load can be as a result of many factors. For example the organization combines digitized and non-digitized information in a manner that can be strategic. Digitized information is applied to the extrusion and dosage processes which require accuracy and tacit information is applied to quality control and assembly which are dexterous and require a combination of skills and information types. The analysis corroborates the result of the interview with the operator who rates the computer system (digitized information) to be of equal importance in comparison to operator expe-rience (tacit information) in their usefulness as sources of information on the factory floor especially for milling axis adjust-ment and spindle speed control. The low load is enhanced when the operator seeks counsel from experienced staff in the case of conflicting information and when the relevant information is not available. 50% of the instruction sheets and manuals are indexed which improves information retrieval. 3.6.3. Case D X  X  information usability
Table 11 shows the information usability for Case D. Injection molding requires operator training in the technique. The characteristics of the material (latex granules) and the impact on the product dimension are not easy to learn and memorize. Information about temperature and time for the heating process is read from the product route card but difficult to mem-orize for different materials and type of mold. The task of material extrusion is digitized and does not require expert user X  X  attention. Quality control 1 applies information from the quality guide which is a list of things to look out for. Information about the components and procedure is applied to product assembly. It is easy to learn and memorize and does not require the government standards and the type of judgements that can be passed on products. User satisfaction is high and the load is low. Table 11 tends to suggest a correlation between novice level learnability and memorability on one hand and infor-mation load ( Table 10 ). Low information use load tends to be related more to novice learnability and memorability than to the expert levels. User satisfaction tends not to discriminate between load levels; this does not reflect the expected outcome. 3.6.4. Summary Case D
Table 12 represents Case D information use crosstabulation between the production tasks and information use architec-ture and load. Table 12 is constructed using data from Tables 11 and 10 . The information use for each task can be separated into two flows: input flow from information source to application in the process and feedback from the process to the feed-back store. The case exhibits both integrated and federated information use architecture. Integrated architecture seems to relate more to low information use load than federated architecture. This is evident in the execution of extrusion, quality 1 and quality 2 tasks. The load tends to be higher in cases of federated information use architecture. There seems to be no rela-tionship between information use, architecture and usability. 3.7. Cross-case analysis Comparative data of the cases are represented in Table 13 . The number of operators in the production process is highest in
Case A (assembly line) followed by Case D (injection molding), Case C (casting) and Case B (press) in that order. The obser-vation is reflected in the level of computerization of the factory floor which decreases with an increase in labor. Parts assem-bly is a dexterous process and requires more human input in comparison to the press or injection molding process. This does not apply to Case B which does not use computer on factory floor. The simplicity of the production process and the orien-tation of the process owner towards non-computerization of factory floor provide an explanation for Case B X  X  behavior. Infor-mation use architecture tends to follow the same pattern of spread as computerization. The cases that apply computers on factory floor (Case C and Case D) tend to have a mixed information use architecture (integrated and federated) while non-computerized cases have a federated architecture (Case A and Case B). Full computerization is not observed. The observation corroborates Haftl (2009) which posits that every human activity can be automated to a certain degree to improve efficiency irrespective of the number of employees.

Information use load tends to discriminate between mixed and single architectures. Mixed information use architecture tends to have low information use load and the single architecture has high information use load. The result is expected be-cause the federated architecture combines different information use formats while the integrated architecture combines similar information use formats resulting in less number of recoding and load. Case B is an exception which shows a low load for a federated architecture. This can be explained by the use of one operator in the production process which reduces the number of recoding. The observations are consistent with the definition of information use load which is based on infor-mation characteristics and not on the capabilities of user as in literature.

The level of errors is low for all the Cases except Case B which has a high level of error. The application of digitized infor-mation explains the low level of errors in Case C and Case D. The level of errors is high in Case B in comparison to Case A despite a common federated architecture. The tacit information use sources of Case B are more prone to errors and the appli-cation of a dedicated telephone line on the factory floor in Case A tends to reduce information use errors. The level of errors tends to be impacted by real time expert intervention and team work as witnessed in Case A in addition to the level of computerization.

Information use learnability and memorability are mostly of novice category which is expected on factory floor where there is little critical thinking and mostly routine activities. The application of engineering drawing in Case A and injection molding technology in Case D introduce the expert level learnability and memorability. User satisfaction tends to vary in-versely with information use load. This corroborates Weick (1995) in the higher the number of decoding/encoding the higher the demand on human processing capacity and the higher the load. A high information load will therefore result in high stress and low user satisfaction. 3.8. Conclusion
The purpose of the study is to investigate the outworking of the  X  X  X arriage X  X  of digitized and non-digitized information systems in the production process. The result of the study tends to suggest that digitized and non-digitized information use can be represented as a single information use architecture which integrates the different information formats and en-ables the application of a common nomenclature and measure. This is an addition to knowledge which prior to the current study has depicted digitized and non-digitized information systems to be dichotomous and incompatible.

The question  X  X  X ow can digitized and non-digitized information systems which are traditionally incompatible be inte-grated in a single architecture and represented by a common nomenclature and measure for the purposes of studying the phenomenon of information use? X  X  which is posed at the beginning of the paper can be addressed by making reference to the study outcome. The architecture is made possible by new concepts, and by redefining old concepts, terms and informa-tion users in literature. For example information load is defined in the current study by the number of recoding the infor-mation goes through from the source to feedback store which is different from Weick X  X  (1995) definition in relation to human processing capacity. The building block for the architecture is the node which is a new concept. The design of the node determines the information use load, usability and the type of information use architecture. The two types of informa-tion use architecture which are federated and integrated architectures are differentiated by information use format in the current study in contrast to literature which applies computer systems approach ( Brandt &amp; Boynton, 1991 ). Integrated infor-mation use architecture consists of one type of information use format and a federated architecture consists of different types of information use formats. Information use format is redefined in the current study and it includes digitized, tacit, mechanical and paper format in contrast to literature which focuses on digitized information use format as in ERP. The necessity for new concepts and a redefinition of terms arose from a new approach to information users which include oper-ators, artifacts such as machines and events like task execution which reflect the practice ( Zhang et al. X  X  1998 ). This is dif-ferent from the literature view of information users which focuses on humans and their information processing capacity.
The second question that is posed at the beginning of the paper is:  X  X  X s there synergy in the integration that is strategic in relation to information load and usability? X  X  The question relates to the objective of the study which is to investigate the im-pact of information use architecture on load and usability on factory floor. The results suggest that information use value flow consists of two sections: input flow and output flow, each section is either federated or integrated information use architecture. The result corroborates Haftl X  X  (2009) observation that every human activity can be automated to a certain de-gree to improve efficiency irrespective of the number of employees. The results suggest that the combination of federated and integrated information use architectures in a single information use value flow is strategic because it impacts informa-tion use load, error level and user satisfaction ( Table 13 ). Where the input flow architecture and output flow architecture are different (e.g. integrated and federated architectures) information use load tends to be lower than where they are of the same type. The result suggests the opposite with the level of information user satisfaction. User satisfaction tends to increase with the level of computer integration in the mixed architecture and vice versa. The same conclusion can be reached through a different way by applying Weick X  X  (1995) approach to information load which is based on human processing capacity. It is arguable that the demand on human processing capacity increases with an increase in information load which can result in user dissatisfaction. A combination of federated and integrated information use architectures in information flow is more likely to lead to a lower level of errors in comparison to information flow which consists of federated information use only. 4. Implication for practice
Managers can identify and minimize adverse information use and consequently reduce the impact on the production pro-cess by applying information use architecture. An example of adverse information use is provided by the organization where the senior investigator of the current research worked as a systems administrator and which is discussed at the beginning of the paper. The organization adopts the dichotomous approach to information use which is found to be inadequate. The importance of appropriate information use is emphasized in literature. Processes demand the right information at the right time to meet the productivity target ( Earl, 1994; Wright, 1998 ). Zhao, Tang, Darlington, Austin, and Culley (2008) empha-sized the need for appropriate and timely information at the operational level of an organization. Errors in the use of infor-mation can be identified and minimized by the application of appropriate information use architecture. The approach makes it possible to collect, organize, and manage all production information. Information is collected at the feedback store of the architecture and organized into digitized, tacit, mechanical and paper types of information. Information management is accomplished through the design and application of information use architecture and node. The same approach can be used to manage the level of satisfaction of information user. Information use architecture is strategic and is applicable where information is used to execute a task. 5. Further study
The study investigates the impact of information use architecture on factory floor where there is little critical thinking and mostly routine activities. A study of the impact of information use architecture on a non-routine production environ-ment will add to knowledge.

The strategic nature of information use architecture is demonstrated in the study in relation to information use load, er-rors and user satisfaction. How information use architecture impacts other operations KPI like the production cycle time needs investigating.

The sample in the study consists of SMEs. A study of the impact of information use architecture on large organizations has not been done.
 Appendix A A.1. Terms descriptions A.1.1. Information format
Digitized information denotes information that can be represented and measured in binary digits (bits) of 0 and 1. It is found in computer systems and can be manipulated using computer software.
 Non-digitized information denotes information that cannot be represented and measured in binary digits (bits) of 0 and 1. E.g. paper format (drawings, schedules, standard operating procedure (SOP) and pictures).

Mechanical information is non-digitized and includes information relayed by actuators, recorders and data loggers. An actuator is a mechanical device which is used to control a system. It is common in batch and continuous flow industries and assumes the form of pneumatic, hydraulic and electric actuators and human muscles.
 A.2. Nature of Information
Explicit information is recognizable by the human senses and can be stored in a database. It can take the form of digitized or non-digitized information and is transmitted through the use of language.

Tacit information is non-digitized, more difficult to access and formulate and assumes the forms of know-how, expertise, skill and routines.
 A.3. Information use architecture
The architecture of information use describes the organization, identification and location of the information use ele-ments that constitute the value stream.

Integrated information use architecture can be described as built around one type of information format. Information use recoding is not needed.

Federated information use architecture is a combination of information of different formats such that each component retains its original format. Recoding of information use is required.
 A.4. Information usability The attributes of usability are learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and user satisfaction.

Learnability indicates the relative ease (or not) with which information formats can be encoded/decoded independent of user ability.
 A.5. Memorability describes how easy it is to memorize the information Usability errors relate to information inconsistency where the same information is obtained from different sources. User satisfaction is measured by user rating of the usefulness of the information.
 The indicators and measures of the attributes of usability are represented in Table A1 .
 A.5.1. Load
Information use load is an indication of the quantity, variety and complexity of the nature and format of the information value stream in relation to that necessary for executing the process. It is measurable by the number of times a piece of infor-mation is recoded before use. The minimum number of recoding is 1 because a piece of information that is applicable to a task cannot have the same format along the value flow from the information source to the feedback store. If that happened the minimum number of recoding would be 0. Information use value flow consists of five stages (source, input, procedure, feedback and feedback store) and the maximum number of recoding from source to feedback store is 4. The level of load is low when the number of recoding is 2 or less, medium for 3 recodings and high for 4 recodings per task. The granularity is deemed appropriate for a range of 1 X 4.
