 Urban Informatics aims to exploit the large quantities of information produced by modern cities in order to gain in-sights into how they function. These insights lay the founda-tion for improving the lives of citizens, by improving the effi-cacy and efficiency of public services, and satisfying complex information needs arising within this context. The goal of the workshop is to provide a multidisciplinary forum which brings together researchers in Big Data (BD), Information Retrieval (IR), Data Mining, and Urban Studies, to explore novel solutions to the numerous theoretical, practical and ethical challenges arising in this context. These include dif-ficulties in collecting city data, creating data management infrastructures, and providing new effective and efficient in-formation access techniques to as many users as possible in the context of a smart city. To foster the development of new BD and IR approaches in Urban Informatics, the workshop makes available a representative dataset of city data, includ-ing Internet-based visual (Flickr) and textual (Tweets and News) media collections. The workshop provides enormous opportunities for data scientists who wish to understand the complexities of working with city data, conduct innovative research within Urban Informatics, and build a long-term community in this emerging research area.

With these themes in mind, the workshop solicits high-quality original research papers in topics which include, but are not limited to:
The UCUI workshop is a one-day workshop. We welcomed two types of submissions: technical and position papers, published in the ACM DL, and not exceeding 6 pages for technical papers and 4 pages for position papers (including references and figures).

The workshop program consists of two invited keynotes and six accepted papers. All accepted papers were original and previously unpublished. They went through a double-blind review process. Each submitted paper was peer-reviewed by at least three programme committee members. The work-shop organisers then examined the reviews and made final paper selections for the workshop. Authors of accepted pa-pers were invited to present their papers at the workshop.
In addition, the workshop program includes a session on an Urban Informatics Data Challenge task where the ac-cepted participant papers were presented as posters. The participant papers were not peer-reviewed, and are only pub-lished on the workshop website.
The relevant experience of the organising committee is as follows: conferences e.g. SIGIR, WWW, and CIKM. He has served as a PC member in various IR and BD confer-ences including SIGIR, ECIR, CIKM, KDD, Middle-ware, and EDBT. He also served as a local organizer in various local and international conferences.  X  Craig Macdonald has co-organised a number of well-attended workshops at major IR conferences, e.g. ECIR, WSDM and CIKM. He was workshop chair and chair-at-large for CIKM 2011, and has served on the pro-gramme committees of all major IR conferences. His research interests encapsulate expert search, learning-to-rank, as well as information access within Smart cities. He is a co-investigator of the Urban Big Data Centre at the University of Glasgow.  X  Iadh Ounis has authored over 150 refereed publica-tions on a wide range of topics, including: large-scale Information Retrieval; social media search; Big Data analytics and information access within smart cities. He has been a track coordinator at TREC Blog and Microblog tracks. He was a co-chair of ESSIR 2007, the general chair of ECIR 2008, and a general co-chair of CIKM 2011. He recently co-chaired the OSIR 2012 and iASC 2014 workshops.  X  Joemon M. Jose has published over 150 journal and conference articles on a wide range of topics, including interactive Information Retrieval, multimedia search, and social media search. He has organised a number of IR-related events like ICMR 2014, ECDL 2010, as well as workshops at previous SIGIR conferences, and IR Fest in Glasgow 2005. He has been senior PC member of the SIGIR, CIKM, and ECIR conferences.  X  Peter Triantafillou has published over 100 papers in the research areas including Big Data Management, Cloud Infrastructures and Computing, Distributed Databases, Information Retrieval, and Social Networks/Systems. He has served in the Technical Program Committees of 100 international conferences, and has been the PC Chair or Vice-chair in several prestigious conferences.  X  Mark Livingston is a social scientist with around 40 peer reviewed research publications both in public health and urban studies. His research interests are in un-derstanding neighbourhoods and neighbourhood dy-namics, which impact active travel and pedestrian ac-cidents. He is currently the project manager of the iMCD project of the Glasgow Urban Big Data Centre.  X  Piyushimita (Vonu) Thakuriah is a Professor of Urban Studies at the University of Glasgow. She is currently the Director of the Glasgow Urban Big Data Centre. Vonu X  X  research interests are in smart transportation and the effective use of Big Data for urban planning, policy and business innovations. She has played a lead-ership role in the areas of Computational Transporta-tion Science.
