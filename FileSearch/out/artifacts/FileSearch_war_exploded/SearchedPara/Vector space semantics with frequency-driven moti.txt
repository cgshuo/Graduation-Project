 Meaning in language is a confluence of experien-tially acquired semantics of words or multi-word phrases, and their semantic composition to create new meanings. For instance, successfully inter-preting a sentence such as requires the knowledge that the semantic conno-tations of  X  X icking the bucket X  as a unit are the same as those for  X  X ying X . Short of explicit su-pervision, such semantic mappings must be in-ferred by a new language speaker through induc-tive mechanisms operating on observed linguis-tic usage. This perspective of acquired meaning aligns with the  X  X eaning is usage X  adage, conso-nant with Wittgenstein X  X  view of semantics. At the same time, the ability to adaptively commu-nicate elaborate meanings can only be conciled through Frege X  X  principle of compositionality, i.e., meanings of larger linguistic constructs can be derived from the meanings of individual compo-nents, modulated by their syntactic interrelations. Indeed, most linguistic usage appears composi-tional. This is supported by the fact even with very limited vocabulary, children and non-native speakers can often communicate surprisingly ef-fectively.

It can be argued that to be sustainable, induc-tive aspects of meaning must be recurrent enough to be learnable by new users. That is, a non-compositional phrase such as  X  X ick the bucket X  is likely to persist in common parlance only if it is frequently used with its associated semantic map-ping. If a usage-driven meaning of a motif is not recurrent enough, learning this mapping is inef-ficient in two ways. First, the sparseness of ob-servations would severely limit accurate inductive acquisition by new observers. Second, the value of learning a very infrequent semantic mapping is likely marginal. This motivates the need for a frequency-driven view of lexical semantics. In particular, such a perspective can be especially advantageous for distributional semantics for rea-sons we outline below.

Distributional semantic models (DSMs) that represent words as distributions over neighbouring contexts have been particularly effective in captur-ing fine-grained lexical semantics (Turney et al., 2010). Such models have engendered improve-ments in diverse applications such as selectional preference modeling (Erk, 2007), word-sense dis-crimination (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003), auto-matic dictionary building (Curran, 2003), and in-formation retrieval (Manning et al., 2008). How-ever, while conventional DSMs consider colloca-tion strengths (through counts and PMI scores) of word neighbourhoods, they disregard much of the regularity in human language. Most significantly, word tokens that act as latent dimensions are of-ten derived from arbitrary tokenization. The ex-ample given in Table 1 succinctly describes this. The first row in the table shows a representation of the meaning of the token  X  X risis X  that a conven-tional DSM might extract from the given sentence after stopword removal. While helpful, the repre-sentation seems unsatisfying since words such as  X  X ress X ,  X  X ake X  and  X  X hores X  seem to have little to do with a crisis. From a semantic perspective, a representation similar to the second is more valu-able: not only does it represent a semantic map-ping for a more specific meaning, but the latent di-mensions of the representation have are less noisy (e.g., while  X  X ake X  is semantically ambiguous, its surrounding context in  X  X n wake of X  disambiguates it) and more intuitive in regards of semantic in-terepretability. This is the overarching theme of this work: we present a frequency driven paradigm for extending distributional semantics to phrasal and sentential levels in terms of such semantically cohesive, recurrent lexical units or motifs .
We propose to identify such semantically cohesive motifs in terms of features inspired from frequency-characteristics, linguistic idiosyn-crasies, and shallow syntactic analysis; and ex-plore both supervised and semi-supervised mod-els to optimally segment a sentence into such mo-tifs. Through exploiting regularities in language usage, the framework can efficiently account for both compositional and non-compositional word usage, while avoiding the issue of data-sparsity by design. Our principal contributions in this paper are:  X  We present a framework for extending dis- X  We present a simple model to segment a sen- X  Word and phrasal representations learnt
This paper is organized as follows: In Sec-tion 2, we briefly review related work in the do-main of compositional distributional semantics, and motivate our formulation. Section 3 describes our methodology, which consists of a frequency-driven segmentation model to partition text into semantically meaningful recurring lineal-subunits, a representation learning framework for learning new semantic embeddings based on this segmen-tation, and an approach to use such embeddings in downstream applications. We present experiments and empirical evaluations for our method in Sec-tion 4. Finally, we conclude in Section 5 with a summary of our principal findings, and a discus-sion of possible directions for future work. While DSMs have been valuable in representing semantics of single words, approaches to extend them to represent the semantics of phrases and sentences has met with only marginal success. While there is considerable variety in approaches and formulations, existing approaches for phrasal level and sentential semantics can broadly be par-titioned into two categories. 2.1 Compositional approaches These have aimed at using semantic representa-tions for individual words to learn semantic rep-resentations for larger linguistic structures. These methods implicitly make an assumption of com-positionality, and often include explicit computa-tional models of compositionality. Notable among such models are the additive and multiplicative models of composition by Mitchell and Lapata (2008), Grefenstette et al. (2010), Baroni and Zamparelli X  X  (2010) model that differentially mod-els content and function words for semantic com-position, and Goyal et al. X  X  SDSM model (2013) that incorporates syntactic roles to model seman-tic composition. Notable among the most effec-tive distributional representations are the recent deep-learning approaches by Socher et al. (2012), that model vector composition through non-linear transformations. While word embeddings and lan-guage models from such methods have been use-ful for tasks such as relation classification, polarity detection, event coreference and parsing; much of existing literature on composition is based on ab-stract linguistic theory and conjecture, and there is little evidence to support that learnt represen-tations for larger linguistic units correspond to their semantic meanings. While works such as the SDSM model suffer from the problem of spar-sity in composing structures beyond bigrams and trigrams, methods such as Mitchell and Lapata (2008)and (Socher et al., 2012) and Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011) are restricted by signifi-cant model biases in representing semantic com-position by generic algebraic operations. Finally, the assumption that semantic meanings for sen-tences could have representations similar to those for smaller individual tokens is in some sense un-intuitive, and not supported by linguistic or seman-tic theories. 2.2 Tree kernels Tree Kernel methods have gained popularity in the last decade for capturing syntactic information in the structure of parse trees (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Moschitti, 2006). Instead of procuring ex-plicit representations, the kernel paradigm directly focuses on the larger goal of quantifying semantic similarity of larger linguistic units. Structural ker-nels for NLP are based on matching substructures within two parse trees , consisting of word-nodes with similar labels. These methods have been use-ful for eclectic tasks such as parsing, NER, se-mantic role labeling, and sentiment analysis. Re-cent approaches such as by Croce et al. (2011) and Srivastava et al. (2013) have attempted to pro-vide formulations to incorporate semantics into tree kernels through the use of distributional word vectors at the individual word-nodes. While this framework is attractive in the lack of assumptions on representation that it makes, the use of distri-butional embeddings for individual tokens means that it suffers from the same shortcomings as de-scribed for the example in Table 1, and hence these methods model semantic relations between word-nodes very weakly. Figure 1 shows an example of the shortcomings of this general approach.
 Figure 1: Tokenwise syntactic and semantic simi-larities don X  X  imply sentential semantic similarity
While the two sentences in consideration have near-identical syntax and could be argued to have semantically aligned words in similar positions, the semantics of the complete sentences are widely divergent. Specifically, the  X  X ag of words X  as-sumption in tree kernels doesn X  X  suffice for these lexemes, and a stronger semantic model is needed to capture phrasal semantics as well as diverging inter-word relations such as in  X  X offee table X  and  X  X ater table X . Our hypothesis is that a model that can even weakly identify recurrent motifs such as  X  X ater table X  or  X  X reaking a fall X  would be help-ful in building more effective semantic represen-tations. A significant advantage of a frequency driven view is that it makes the concern of com-positionality of recurrent phrases immaterial. If a motif occurs frequently enough in common par-lance, its semantics could be captured with distri-butional models irrespective of whether its associ-ated semantics are compositional or acquired. 2.3 Identifying multi-word expressions Several approaches have focused on supervised identification of multi-word expressions (MWEs) through statistical (Pecina, 2008; Villavicencio et al., 2007) and linguistically motivated (Piao et al., 2005) techniques. More recently, hybrid methods based on both statistical as well as linguistic fea-tures have been popular (Tsvetkov and Wintner, 2011). Ramisch et al. (2008) demonstrate that adding part-of-speech tags to frequency counts substantially improves performance. Other meth-ods have attempted to exploit morphological, syn-tactic and semantic characteristics of MWEs. In particular, approaches such as Bannard (2007) use syntactic rigidity to characterize MWEs. While existing work has focused on the classification task of categorizing a phrasal constituent as a MWE or a non-MWE, the general ideas of most of these works are in line with our current frame-work, and the feature-set for our motif segmen-tation model is designed to subsume most of these ideas. It is worthwhile to point out that the task of motif segmentation is slightly differ-ent from MWE identification. Specifically, the onus on recurrent occurrences means that non-decomposibility is not an essential consideration for a word to be considered a motif. In line with the proposed paradigm, typical MWEs such as  X  X hoot the breeze X ,  X  X our note X  and  X  X ot dog X  would even decomposable recurrent lineal phrases such as  X  X ove story X ,  X  X ederal government X , and  X  X il-lions of people X  are marked as meaningful recur-rent motifs. Finally, and least interestingly, we include common named entities such as  X  X nited States X  and  X  X ava Virtual Machine X  within the am-bit of motifs. In this section, we define our frequency-driven framework for distributional semantics in detail. As just described above, our definition for motifs is less specific than MWEs. With such a working definition, contiguous motifs are likely to make distributional representations less noisy and also assist in disambiguating context. Also, the lack of specificity ensures that such motifs are common enough to meaningfully influence distributional representation beyond single tokens. A method towards frequency-driven distributional semantics could involve the following principal components: 3.1 Linear segmentation model The segmentation model forms the core of the framework. Ideally, it fragments a given sen-tence into non-overlapping, semantically mean-ingful, empirically frequent contiguous sub-units or motifs. The model accounts for possible seg-mentations of a sentence into potential motifs, and prefers recurrent and cohesive motifs through fea-tures that capture frequency-based and statistical features, as well as linguistic idiosyncracies. This is accomplished using a very simple linear chain model and a rich feature set consisting of a combi-nation of frequency-driven, information theoretic and linguistically motivated features.

Let an observed sentence be denoted by x , with the individual tokens x i denoting the i X  X h token in the sentence. The segmentation model is a chain LVM (latent variable model) that aims to maxi-mize a linear objective defined by: where f i are arbitrary Markov features that can depend on segments (potential motifs) of the ob-served sentence x , and contiguous latent states. The features are chosen so as to best represent frequency-based, statistical as well as linguistic considerations for treating a segment as an ag-glutinative unit, or a motif. In specific, these features could encode characteristics such as fre-quency statistics, collocation strengths and syn-tactic distinctness, or inflectional rigidity of the considered segments; described in detail in Sec-tion 3.2. The model is an instantiation of a sim-ple featurized HMM, and the weighted sum of fea-tures corresponding to a segment is cognate with an affinity score for the  X  X tickiness X  of the segment, i.e., the affinity for the segment to be treated as holistic unit or a single motif.

We also associate a penalizing cost for each non unary-motif to avoid aggressive agglutination of tokens. In particular, for an ngram occurrence to be considered a motif, the marginal contribution due to the affinity of the prospective motif should at minimum exceed this penalty. The weights for the affinity functions as well as these penalties are learnt from data using full as well as partial anno-tations. The latent state-variables y k denotes the membership of the token x k to a unary or a larger motif; and the state-sequence collectively gives the segmentation of the sentence. An individual state-variable y k encodes a pairing of the size of the encompassing ngram motif, and the position of the word x k within it. For instance, y k = T 3 denotes that the token x k is the final position in a trigram motif. 3.1.1 Inference of optimal segmentation If the optimal weights w i are known, inference for the best motif segmentation can be performed in linear time (in the number of tokens) follow-ing the generalized Viterbi algorithm. A slightly modified version of Viterbi could also be used to find segmentations that are constrained to agree with some given motif boundaries, but can seg-ment other parts of the sentence optimally under these constraints. This is necessary for the sce-nario of semi-supervised learning of weights with partially annotated sentences, as described later. 3.2 Learning motif affinities and penalties We briefly discuss data-driven learning of weights for features that define the motif affinity scores and penalties. We describe learning of the model parameters with fully annotated training data, as well as an approach for learning motif segmenta-tion that requires only partial supervision. Supervised learning: In the supervised case, op-the training set. For this purpose, we created a dataset of 1000 sentences from the Simple En-glish Wikipedia and the Gigaword Corpus, and manually annotated it with motif boundaries us-ing BRAT (Stenetorp et al., 2012). In this case, learning can follow the online structured percep-tron learning procedure by Collins (2002), where weights updates for the k X  X h training example Here y 0 = Decode ( x ( k ) , w ) is the optimal Viterbi decoding using the current estimates of the weights. Updates are run for a large number of iterations until the change in objective drops below a threshold, and the learning rate  X  is adaptively modified as described in Collins et al. Implicitly, the weight learning algorithm can be seen as a gradient descent procedure minimizing the difference between the scores of highest scoring (Viterbi) state sequences, and the label state sequences.
 Semi-supervised learning: In the semi-supervised case, the labels y ( k ) commonplace scenario, where a part of a sentence has clear motif-boundaries, whereas the rest of the sentence is not annotated. For accumulating such data, we looked for occurrences of 2500 expres-sions from the WikiMWE dataset in sentences from the combined Simple English Wikipedia and Gigaword corpora. The query expressions in the retrieved sentences were marked with motif boundaries, while the remaining tokens in the sentences were left unannotated.

While the Viterbi algorithm can be used for tag-ging optimal state-sequences given the weights, the structured perceptron can learn optimal model weights given gold-standard sequence labels. Hence, in this case, we use a variation of the hard EM algorithm for learning. The algorithm pro-ceeds as follows: in the E-step, we use the current values of weights to compute hard-expectations, i.e., the best scoring Viterbi sequences among those consistent with the observed state labels. In the M-step, we take the decoded state-sequences in the E-step as observed, and run perceptron learning to update feature weights w i . Pseudocode of the learning algorithm for the partially labeled case is given in Algorithm 1.
 Algorithm 1 1: Input: Partially labeled data D = { ( x,y ) i } 2: Output: Weights w 3: Initialization: Set w i randomly,  X  i 4: for i : 1 to maxIter do 5: Decode D with current w to find optimal 6: Run Structured Perceptron algorithm with de-7: end for 8: return w
The semi-supervised approach enables incor-poration of significantly more training data. In particular, this method could be used in conjunc-tion with a supervised approach. This would in-volve initializing the weights prior to the semi-supervised procedure with the weights from the supervised learning model, so as to seed the semi-supervised approach with reasonable model, and use the partially annotated data to fine-tune the su-pervised model. The sequential approach, akin to annealing weights, can efficiently utilize both full and partial annotations. 3.2.1 Feature engineering In this section, we describe the principal features used in the segmentation model Transitional features and penalties:  X  Transitional features f trans ( y i  X  1 ,y i ) =  X  N-gram penalties: f ngram We define a Frequency-based, information theoretic, and POS features:  X  Absolute and log-normalized motif frequen- X  Absolute and log-normalized motif frequen- X  Medians and maxima of pairwise collocation  X  Histogram counts of inflectional forms of to- X  Entropies of histogram distributions of inflec- X  Features encoding syntactic rigidity: ratios
Additionally, a few feature for the segmenta-tions model contained minor orthographic features based on word shape (length and capitalization patterns). Also, all numbers, URLs, and cur-rency symbols were normalized to the special NU-MERIC, URL, and CURRENCY tokens respec-tively. Finally, a gazetteer feature checked for oc-currences of motifs in a gazetteer of named enti-ties. 3.3 Representation learning With the segmentation model described in the pre-vious section, we process text from the English Gi-gaword corpus and the Simple English Wikipedia to partition sentences into motifs. Since the seg-mentation model accounts for the contexts of the entire sentence in determining motifs, different in-stances of the same token could evoke different meaning representations. Consider the following sentences tagged by the segmentation model, that would correspond to different representations of the token  X  X emains X : once as a standalone motif, and once as part of an encompassing bigram motif ( X  X emains classified X ).

Hog prices have declined sharply , while the cost of corn remains relatively high.

Even with the release of such documents, ques-tions are not answered, since only the agency knows what remains classified
Given constituent motifs of each sentence in the data, we can now define neighbourhood distribu-tions for unary or phrasal motifs in terms of other motifs (as envisioned in Table 1). In our experi-ments, we use a window-length of 5 adjoining mo-tifs on either side to define the neighbourhood of a constituent. Naturally, in the presence of multi-word motifs, the neighbourhood boundary could be more extended than in a conventional DSM.
With such neighbourhood contexts, the distri-butional paradigm posits that semantic similarity between a pair of motifs can be given by a sense of  X  X istance X  between the two distributions. Most popularly, traditional measures of vector distance such as the cosine similarity, Euclidean distance and City-block distance have been used in sev-eral distributional approaches. Additionally, sev-eral distance measures between discrete distribu-tions exist in statistical literature, most famously the Kullback Leibler divergence, Bhattacharyya distance and the Hellinger distance. Recent work (Lebret and Lebret, 2013) has shown that the Hellinger distance is an especially effective mea-sure in learning distributional embeddings, with Hellinger PCA being much more computationally inexpensive than neural language modeling ap-proaches, while performing much better than stan-dard PCA, and competitive with the state-of-the-art in downstream evaluations. Hence, we use the Hellinger measure between neighbourhood motif distributions in learning representations.

The Hellinger distance between two categorical distributions P = ( p 1 ...p k ) and Q = ( q 1 ...q k ) is defined as:
The Hellinger measure has intuitively desir-able properties: specifically, it can be seen as the Euclidean distance between the square-roots transformed distributions, where both vec-tors same(Euclidean) norm. Finally, we perform SVD on the motif similarity matrix (with size of the or-der of the total vocabulary in the corpus), and re-tain the first k principal eigenvectors to obtain low-dimensional vector representations that are more convenient to work with. In our preliminary ex-periments, we found that k = 300 gave quanti-tatively good results, with marginal change with added dimensionality. We use this setting for all our experiments. In this section, we describe some experimental evaluations and findings for our approach. We first quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the perfor-mance of the segmentation model, and then evalu-ate the distributional motif representations learnt by the model through two downstream applica-tions. 4.1 Motif segmentation In an evaluation of the motif segmentations model within the perspective of our framework, we be-lieve that exact correspondence to human judg-ment is unrealistic, since guiding principles for defining motifs, such as semantic cohesion, are hard to define and only serve as working princi-ples. However, for purposes of relative compar-ison, we quantitatively evaluate the performance of the motif segmentation models on the fully an-notated dataset. For this experiment, the gold-annotated corpus was split into a training and test sets in a 9:1 proportion. A small fraction of the training split was set apart for development and validation. For this evaluation, we considered a motif boundary as correct only for an exact match, i.e., when both its boundaries (left and right) were correctly predicted. Also, since a majority of mo-tifs are unary tokens, including them into consider-ation artificially boosts the accuracy, whereas we are more interested in the prediction of larger n-gram tokens. Hence we report results on the per-formance on only non-unary motifs.

Table 2 shows the performance of the segmen-tation model with the three proposed learning ap-proaches described earlier. For a baseline, we consider a rule-based model that simply learns all ngram segmentations seen in the training data, and marks any occurrence of a matching token se-quence as a motif; without taking neighbouring context into account. We observe that this model has a very high precision (since many token se-quences marked as motifs would recur in simi-lar contexts, and would thus have the same mo-tif boundaries). However, the rule-based method has a very row recall due to lack of generaliza-tion capabilities. We see that while all three learn-ing algorithms perform better than the baseline, the performance of the purely unsupervised sys-tem is inferior to supervised approaches. This is not unexpected: the supervision provided to the model is very weak due to a lack of negative ex-amples (which leads to spurious motif taggings, about her rotten marriage , women cheered her on. cutting spending , but by raising taxes still further. did resist the Third Reich and paid the price. leading to a low precision), as well as no examples of transitions between adjacent motifs (to learn transitional weights and penalties). The super-vised model expectedly outperforms both the rule-based and the semi-supervised systems. However, the supervised learning model with subsequent an-nealing outperforms the supervised model in terms of both precision and recall; showing the utility of the semi-supervised method when seeded with a good initial model, and the additive value of par-tially labeled data.

Qualitative analysis of motif-segmented sen-tences shows that our designed feature-set is effec-tive and helpful in identifying semantically cohe-sive ngrams. Table 3 provides four examples. The first example correctly identifies  X  X ent public X , while missing out on the potential motif  X  X heered her on X . In general, these examples illustrate that the model can identify idiomatic and idiosyncratic themes as well as commonly recurrent ngrams (in the second example, the model picks out  X  X as be-come X  which is highly recurrent, but doesn X  X  have the semantic cohesiveness of some of the other motifs). In particular, consider the second exam-ple, where the model picks  X  X hite elephant X  as a motif. In such cases, the disambiguating influence of context incorporated by the motif is apparent.
The above table shows some of the top results for the unary token  X  X lephant X  by frequency, and frequent unary and non-unary motifs for the mo-tif  X  X hite elephant X  retrieved by the segmentation model. 4.2 Distributional representations For evaluating distributional representations for motifs (in terms of other motifs) learnt by the framework, we test these representations in two downstream tasks: sentence polarity classification and metaphor detection. For sentence polarity, we consider the Cornell Sentence Polarity corpus by Pang and Lee (2005), where the task is to classify the polarity of a sentence as positive or negative. The data consists of 10662 sentences from movie reviews that have been annotated as either posi-tive or negative. For composing the motifs repre-sentations to get judgments on semantic similarity of sentences, we use our recent Vector Tree Ker-nel approach The VTK approach defines a convo-lutional kernel over graphs defined by the depen-dency parses of sentences, using a vector repre-sentation at each graph node that representing a single lexical token. For our purposes, we mod-ify the approach to merge the nodes of all tokens that constitute a motif occurrence, and use the mo-tif representation as the vector associated with the node. Table 4 shows results for the sentence polar-ity task.
 Table 4: Results for Sentence Polarity detection
For this task, the motif based distributional em-beddings vastly outperform a conventional distri-butional model (DSM) based on token distribu-tions, as well as additive (AVM) and multiplica-tive (MVM) models of vector compositionality, as proposed by Lapata et al. The model is compet-itive with the state-of-the-art VTK (Srivastava et al., 2013) that uses the SENNA neural embeddings by Collobert et al. (2011).
 On the metaphor detection task, we use the Metaphor dataset (Hovy et al., 2013). The data consists of sentences with defined phrases, and the task consists of identifying the linguistic use in these phrases as metaphorical or literal. For this task, the motif based model is expected to perform well as common metaphorical usage is generally through idiosyncratic MWEs, which the motif based models is specially geared to capture through the features of the segmentation model. For this task, we again use the VTK formalism for combining vector representations of the indi-vidual motifs. Table 5 shows that the motif-based DSM does better than discriminative models such as CRFs and SVMs, and also slightly improves on the VTK kernel with distributional embeddings. We have presented a new frequency-driven frame-work for distributional semantics of not only lex-ical items but also longer cohesive motifs. The theme of this work is a general paradigm of seek-ing motifs that are recurrent in common parlance, are semantically coherent, and are possibly non-compositional. Such a framework for distribu-tional models avoids the issue of data sparsity in learning of representations for larger linguis-tic structures. The approach depends on drawing features from frequency statistics, statistical cor-relations, and linguistic theories; and this work provides a computational framework to jointly model recurrence and semantic cohesiveness of motifs through compositional penalties and affin-ity scores in a data driven way.

While being deliberately vague in our work-ing definition of motifs, we have presented simple efficient formulations to extract such motifs that uses both annotated as well as partially unanno-tated data. The qualitative and quantitative analyis of results from our preliminary motif segmenta-tion model indicate that such motifs can help to disambiguate contexts of single tokens, and pro-vide cleaner, more interpretable representations. Finally, we obtain motif representations in form of low-dimensional vector-space embeddings, and our experimental findings indicate value of the learnt representations in downstream applications. We believe that the approach has considerable the-oretical as well as practical merits, and provides a simple and clean formulation for modeling phrasal and sentential semantics.

In particular, we believe that ours is the first method that can invoke different meaning repre-sentations for a token depending on textual context of the sentence. The flexibility of having separate representations to model different semantic senses has considerable valuable, as compared with ex-tant approaches that assign a single representation to each token, and are hence constrained to con-flate several semantic senses into a common repre-sentation. The approach also elegantly deals with the problematic issue of differential compositional and non-compositional usage of words. Future work can focus on a more thorough quantitative evaluation of the paradigm, as well as extension to model non-contiguous motifs.
