 The study of extremist groups and their interaction is a crucial task in order to maintain homeland security and peace. Tools such as social networks analysis and text min-ing have contributed to their understanding in order to de-velop counter-terrorism applications. This work addresses the topic-based community key-members extraction problem , for which our method combines both text mining and so-cial network analysis techniques. This is achieved by first applying latent Dirichlet allocation to build two topic-based social networks in online forums: one social network oriented towards the thread creator point-of-view, and the other is oriented towards the repliers of the overall forum. Then, by using different network analysis measures, topic-based key members are evaluated using as benchmark a social net-work built a plain representation of the network of posts. Experiments were successfully performed using an English language based forum available in the Dark Web portal.

Today, it is no mystery that terrorists and cyber-criminals are looking for uncovered means to seek peers with the same interests such as internet forums, blogs, and social networks, where they can share and comment their feelings and inter-ests with other that support their cause. In this sense, Dark Web 1 has brought endless potential to achieve the coordi-nation, propaganda delivery, and other unwanted interac-tions between extremists groups. However, web information can be retrieved for further analysis. Many researchers have been wondering whether the leaders of the Dark Web can be identified by their interaction with other members. The Dark Web is conformed by Virtual Communities of Interests (VCoI) [9, 16] are communities which members are reunited by their shared interests in a topic, like fan clubs of artists. Therefore, a key aspects when studying VCoI is to achieve a complete understanding on what are the main interests of the community. Only then, it will be possible to obtain a better insight of community X  X  social aspects, leading to a better identification of the key members (i.e. Opinion Leaders), density reduction, among other benefits. Different approaches have been previously developed for Social Networks, Virtual Communities [11], and Virtual Com-munities of Practices [4, 17]. To the best of our knowledge, none Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for enhancing the So-cial Network Analysis (SNA) has ever been developed in Dark Web portals before. However, we think the applica-tion of these techniques may enhance greatly SNA results. This work X  X  main contribution is the hybrid approach us-ing topic-models and SNA for enhancing the extraction of key-members in a VCoI.

This paper is structured as follows: In section 2, previous work on SNA and text mining for key members identification is presented, as well as previous work on the Dark Web fo-rums analysis. Then, in section 3 the proposed methodology
Internet-based forums or platforms for terrorists and cyber-criminals.
 to solve the topic-based community key members extraction problem and main contribution of this work is described. In section 4 the experimental setup is detailed, and its results are discussed. Finally in section 5, the main conclusions of this paper and future work are presented.
Since Dark Web is a VCoI, there are different goals as-sociated to their members X  objectives [7]. In this case, the support of the community with an online forum where its anonymity, ubiquitous, and free-of-speech makes the perfect environment to share fundamentalism and terrorism propa-ganda. Therefore, a method to recognize the underlying members X  objectives is needed in order to identify threats or security issues. Topic-based SNA is a way to track, in some degree, topics on members X  thread, which can be related to members X  goals.

In the following, previous work on topic-based SNA is pre-sented, as well as related work on Dark Web Social Network Analysis applications.
SNA [22] helps to understand relationships in a given com-munity analyzing its graph representation. Users are seen as nodes and relations among users are seen as arcs. This way, several techniques have been proposed to extract key mem-bers [12], classify users according his relevance within the community [14], discovering and describing resulting sub-communities [10], amongst other applications. However, all these approaches leave aside the meaning of relationships among users. Therefore, analysis based only on reply of mails or posts to measure relationships X  strongness or weak-ness it is not a good indicator.

McCallum et al. in [11] described how to determine roles and topics in a text-based social networks by building Author-Recipient-Topic (ART) and Role-Author-Recipient-Topic (RART) models. Furthermore, in Pathak et al. [13], a com-munity based topic-Model integrated social network anal-ysis technique (Community-Author-Recipient-Topic model or CART) is proposed to extract communities from a emails corpus based on the topics covered by different members of the overall network. These approaches novelty is the use of data mining on text from the social network to perform SNA to study Roles or Sub-groups extraction.
As described by Xu &amp; Chen in [25], the topology of dark networks share different properties with other types of net-works, where small-world structures are determined by the information flow properties, characterized by short average path and a high clustering coefficient. In this sense, so-cial network analysis tools used in other virtual communi-ties applications [19], could be useful to analyze this kind of structures. They combine concepts obtained from com-munities X  administrators into a concept-based text mining, which allow to obtain interesting results in terms of pur-pose accomplishment in a Virtual Community of Practice (VCoP).

In Reid et al. [18], Web forums where analyzed in or-der to determine whether a given community has been in-volved with terrorist presence by using automated and semi-automated procedures to gather information and analyze it. Other applications, such as the proposed by Zhou et al. in [29], aims towards the capture of domestic Web forums and the creation of a social network mapping to identify their structure and cluster affinities. Finally, in [28] a complete framework on how to build a portal of Dark Web forums is presented, where data collection and integration, as well as its visualization and open access, are the main contributions of the authors.
 Previous work on key-members identification on the Dark Web [24], describes how several centrality measures can be used to identify different key-members of a social network. Here, the degree, betweenness, and closeness measures [6] have been described as tools to characterize key-members of a given social network. It is important to highlight that this approach has been traditionally used in previous work.
Latent semantic analysis has been previously applied in different Dark Web applications, such as [5] where Latent Semantic Indexing was used to link nodes to certain topics in the network construction. Furthermore, in [26], an latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) based web crawling framework is proposed to discover different topics from Dark Web forum cites, but not further social network analysis applications with these findings. Thus, leaving without measuring many social aspects from the Dark Web social structure.
In terms of text mining in Dark Web forums [2], appli-cations have been oriented to model assessment and feature selection in order to improve the classification of messages that contains sensitive information on extremists X  opinions and sentiments. Also, authorship analysis [1] has been previ-ously applied in order to analyze the groups X  authorship ten-dencies, and more important, tackling the anonymity prob-lem associated to this type of virtual communities.
The main question of this work is how to enhance the key-members discovery based on a topic-based social net-work structure. The first step is to obtain a reduced/filtered representation of the inner social community. However, this representation must be created in such way that informa-tion contained is better to discover key-members (aligned to community X  X  goals and members who produce interaction). The second step is to apply a core members X  algorithm to obtain the key-members of a virtual community based on their respective topics of interest. As a result, we obtain the rank of the complete community members where for each community interesting topic, we are able to reveal members that can be considered as experts or key on that topics.
We must mention the difference between a key-member and a highly-radical member, since key members have sev-eral characteristics that define them. Firstly, a key member may be highly-radical member in a given topic or not. Sec-ondly, he/she may increase the interaction in the community because he/she points out interesting messages, which pro-duce replies from different level of members. We will focus on key-members of any kind, afterwards, depending on the topic it would be possible to classify him/her as a radical member or not. Of course, it is possible to automate the process of radical member discovery, however, more work is needed to avoid subjectivity. Furthermore, accusing or pointing such label on a person is not a simple matter and implications are far beyond this work.

We defined a key-member as a person totally aligned with the VCoIs X  goals and topics. Thus, producing contents which are very relevant to satisfy other members X  interests. The only way to measure a key-member as defined, is using an hy-brid approach of SNA combined with latent semantic-based text mining. This way, we can discover threatening topics, and perform specific analysis on each one.
Let us introduce some concepts. In the following, let V a vector of words that defines the vocabulary to be used. We will refer to a word w , as a basic unit of discrete data, indexed by { 1 ,..., |V|} . A post message is a sequence of S words defined by w = ( w 1 ,...,w S ), where w s represents the s th word in the message. Finally, a corpus is defined by a collection of P post messages denoted by C = ( w 1 ,..., w A vectorial representation of the posts corpus is given by TF-IDF = ( m ij ) ,i  X  X  1 ,..., |V|} and j  X  X  1 ,..., |P|} , where m ij is the weight associated to whether a given word is more important than another one in a document. The m ij weights considered in this research is defined as an improvement of the tf-idf term [21] ( term frequency times inverse document frequency ), defined by where n ij is the frequency of the i th word in the j th doc-ument and n i is the number of documents containing word i . The tf-idf term is a weighted representation of the im-portance of a given word in a document that belongs to a collection of documents. The term frequency (TF) indicates the weight of each word in a document, while the inverse document frequency (IDF) states whether the word is fre-quent or uncommon in the document, setting a lower or higher weight respectively.
A topic model can be considered as a probabilistic model that relates documents and words through variables which represent the main topics inferred from the text itself. In this context, a document can be considered as a mixture of topics, represented by probability distributions which can generate the words in a document given these topics. The inferring process of the latent variables, or topics, is the key component of this model, whose main objective is to learn from text data the distribution of the underlying topics in a given corpus of text documents.

A main topic model is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [3]. LDA is a Bayesian model where latent topics of documents are inferred from estimated probability dis-tributions over the training dataset. The key idea of LDA, is that every topic is modeled as a probability distribution over the set of words represented by the vocabulary ( w  X  X  ), and every document as a probability distribution over a set of topics ( T ). These distributions are sampled from multi-nomial Dirichlet distributions.

For LDA, given the smoothing parameters  X  and  X  , and a joint distribution of a topic mixture  X  , the idea is to de-termine the probability distribution to generate from a set of topics T , a message composed by a set of S words w ( w = ( w 1 ,...,w S )), where p ( z s |  X  ) can be represented by the random variable  X  , such that topic z s is presented in document i ( z i s = 1). A final expression can be deduced by integrating equation 2 over the random variable  X  and summing over topics z  X  X  . Given this, the marginal distribution of a message can be defined as follows: p ( w |  X , X  ) =
The final goal of LDA is to estimate previously described distributions to build a generative model for a given cor-pus of messages. There are several methods developed for making inference over these probability distributions such as variational expectation-maximization [3], a variational dis-crete approximation of equation 3 empirically used by [23], and by a Gibbs sampling Markov chain Monte Carlo model efficiently implemented and applied by [15].
To build the social network, the members X  interaction must be taken into consideration. In general, members X  ac-tivity is followed according to its participation on the forum. Likewise, participation appears when a member post in the community. Because the activity of the VCoI is described according members X  participation, the network will be con-figured according to the following: Nodes will be the VCoI members, and arcs will represent interaction between them. How to link the members and how to measure their interac-tions to complete the network is our main concern.
In this work, will be describe two VCoIs X  network repre-sentation according the following replying schema of mem-bers: 1. Creator-oriented Network : When a member cre-2. Last Reply-oriented Network : Every reply of a
In figure 1 the latter two approaches of network conver-sion of the forum is presented. In figure 1, arcs represents members X  replies and nodes represent the users who made the posts. In our first approach, the weight of arcs will be a counter of how many times a given member replies to other one.
 Figure 1: Two different network models to represent a given forum interaction.

In order to consider the reply of members according to the community purpose (for any of these configurations), and to filter noisy posts, a topic-based message reduction is performed. According to previous network configurations, the topic-based filtering method is used in order to remove all replies that are not according to the posts X  topic. Here, by using LDA, a list of keywords for each topic is deter-mined, and later, used to build the final version of the social network.
Previous work [19] brings a method to evaluate commu-nity goals accomplishment. In this work we will use this approach to classify the members X  posts according VCoIs X  goals. These goals are defined as a set of terms, which are composed by a set of keywords or statements in natural lan-guage.

The idea is to compare with euclidean distance two mem-bers X  posts. If the distance is over a certain threshold  X  , an interaction will be considered between them. We support the idea that this will help us to avoid irrelevant interac-tions. For example, in a VCoI with k goals (or topics), let TB j a post of user j that is a reply to post of user i ( TB The distance between them will be calculated with equa-tion 4.
Where g ik is the score of topic k in post of user i . It is clear that the distance exists only if TB j is a reply to TB After that, the weight of arc a i,j is calculated according to equation 5.
We used this weight in both configurations previously de-scribed (Creator-oriented and Last Reply-oriented). After-wards, we applied HITS [8] to find the key members on the different network configurations.
First, as a baseline proceedure, Algorithm 1 shows how to determine the Semantic Weights Matrix, that assigns an score to every post according to all topics considered for the network construction. In this case, the algorithm intially determines the TF-IDF matrix according to Equation 1, the a semantic matrix SM according to topic-based text mining described in Section 3.2 and Section 3.1 respectively. Finally, the matrix multiplication between TF-IDF and SM defines the SWM matrix.

Algorithm 2 presents the pseudo-code on the graph G c = ( N , A ) is build by using the Creator-oriented network. First, the SWM matrix is build according to Algorithm 1. Then, considering all of the posts P , the network is built following the structure presented in Figure 1 (a). This is, for each post creator i , the arc weight a i,j is increased according to the number of repliers j , that their messages X  distance greater or equal than the threshold  X  .

Algorithm 3, as well as the latter, defines in the first place the SWM matrix. Then, according to in Figure 1 (b), for each Algorithm 1 Initialize Semantic Weights Matrix Input: V (Vocabulary) Input: P (Posts) Input: k (Number of Topics) Output: Semantic Weights Matrix SWM [ |P| ,k ] 1: TF-IDF [ |P| , |V| ] (Eq. 1) 2: SM [ k V ]  X  Build SM (semantic matrix) according to Top-3: SWM [ |P| ,k ]  X  TF-IDF  X  SM T Algorithm 2 Creator-oriented Network Input: P (Posts) Output: Network G c = ( N , A ) 1: Build SWM according to Algorithm 1 2: Initialize N = {} , A = {} 3: for each i  X  X  do 4: N  X  X   X  i 5: end for 6: for each i  X  X  .creator do 7: for each j  X  X  i.replies } ,i 6 = j do 8: if d m ( P i ,P j )  X   X  then 10: A X  X  X  a i,j 11: end if 12: end for 13: end for post username i , the arc weight a i,j is increased according to its number of all repliers j whose messages X  distance are greater or equal than a threshold  X  .

The proposed methodology was applied in the Ansar1 En-glish language based forum, available on the Dark Web por-tal 2 , for which examples of the topic extraction methodol-ogy, network construction, and key-members using the HITS algorithm were determined.
 In the following, an analysis of topics extracted using LDA (described in Section 3.2) is presented. Then, the net-work topology construction by using both Reply-oriented and Creator-oriented structures for the whole period is de-scribed. Finally, key-members where determined using HITS (both authority and hub scores), whose results where com-pared against different topologies of the social network.
In this section, results obtained for the Dark Web Ansar1 forum are presented and discussed accordingly. Firstly, the definition of topics using graphical models are presented as well as brief analysis on main extracted topics. Secondly, different network representations are displayed as well as benchmark network evaluations. Finally, HITS algorithm results for authority and hub scores and discussion are pre-sented.
There are 14 months (Dec. 2008 -Jan. 2010) of data available. Posts were created by 376 members and extracted topics where realized over 29.057 posts P and 103.791 words in the vocabulary V by using a C++ Gibbs sampling-based implementation of LDA 3 previously described in Section 3.2.
Topics extracted where evaluated according to the com-pactness of each topic, by the average shortest distance (ASD) among the top 30 words in the topic [27]. The ASD between two keywords w i and w j is determined by,
ASD( w i ,w j ) = max { log ( N i ) ,log ( N j ) } X  log ( N where N i is the number of posts that contains w i , N i,j the number of posts that contain both of them, and |P| is the total number of posts in the corpus. By using equation 6 [27], a representative number of topics was determined, by evaluating the ASD number for k  X  [10 , 50], where 47 was the number of topics with lowest ASD. Then, topics were manually grouped into concepts categories, used for social network analysis.

In Table 1, the overall concept proposed is  X  X ocal Con-flicts X  as for its main topics are related to terrorist and counter-terrorism activities over different localities, such as Russia, Irak, Somalia, India, and Afghanistan.

Table 2 is  X  X ar on Terror X , as its main topics are related to U.S. activities and relations towards terrorism activities, where the proposed topic names are  X  X ar X ,  X  X merican Sol-dier X ,  X  X mprisonment X ,  X  X bama X , and  X  X ilitary Operations X .
Finally, as shown in Table 3, the overall concept proposed is  X  X ecruiting X  where topics such as  X  X eligious Propaganda X ,  X  X eligious Conflicts X ,  X  Ansar  X ,  X  X amily X , and  X  X deology X  are included.
In Figure 2 (a) the whole corpus social network is pre-sented without any filtering methods. This can be inter-preted as the complete network built by using the complete repliers structure, where the edge a i,j between user i and j is defined for every interaction between users. Then in Fig-ure 2 (b) and (c) we present the same graphs but filtered using topic-based methods. In this case, it is possible to see a great density reduction. This suggests that visaliza-tion techniques, such as graphs, can provide better visual information to analysts. Other great benefit, is that, since we have lesser dense graph, SNA algorithms, such as HITS, PageRank, among others, run in shorter times.

Furthermore, in Figure 2 (a), it is possible to observe very clearly three centers of interaction (or participation). If we http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/ [Last accessed 21-10-2010] Figure 2: Social network visualization (a) without topic-based filtering and (b) topic-based filtering, and (c) topic-based filtering for  X  X ocal Conflict X  (us-ing creator network representation) use HITS to analyze the information on this graph, the re-sults are that key-members correspond to the three admin-istrators of the community which can also be seen in the graph. Therefore, the huge amount of posts from these mem-bers makes all other interactions look rather small, making useless the traditional way for key-members detecton. We can correct this situation by using eather concept-based or Topic-based filtering.

In Figure 2 (b) and (c) we can observe that previously stated three centers are gone, and it is much more diffuse to observe centers of interaction from the graphs. However, making an analysis to discover which are the key members now is faster and provide better results. In fact, when ap-pliying HITS, it is possible to figure out other members, rather than administrators, as key-members of the commu-nity. The comparison may be seen in Table 4.

More specifically, for  X  X ocal Conflicts X  topics, in Figure 3 and Figure 4, the visualization for both Reply-oriented and Creator-oriented social networks are presented respectively with their top 8 users using HITS hub score.
 Figure 3: Visualization of the complete  X  X ocal con-flict X  network and their top 8 users in the Reply-oriented network for the complete period of the fo-rum activity, using the hub score from HITS.
 In Figure 3 (a) all interactions presented for the  X  X ocal Conflicts X  topic for Reply-oriented network configuration are depicted, where there is no relevant information that could be infered or deduced directly. However, by listing top key-between them to the  X  X ocal Conflicts X  concept from the Ansar1 forum. between them to the  X  X ar on Terror X  concept from the Ansar1 forum. between them to the  X  X ecruiting X  concept from the Ansar1 forum. evaluation for Creator-oriented network.
 members using computed HITS hub score, it is possible to make decissions towards who X  X  who in this topic-based net-work. This can be visualized in Figure 3 (b) top 8 hub score are presented from previously described network configura-tion, where members with higher score have stronger arcs between each other.
 Figure 4: Visualization of the complete  X  X ocal con-flict X  network and their top 8 users in the Creator-oriented network for the complete period of the fo-rum activity, using the hub score from HITS.
In Table 5, the top 5 users are listed (with their respective hub score) for the Creator-oriented network and last Reply-oriented networks for all topics. In this case, it can be seen that in none of both cases, the users were repeated, which states that the topic-based network structure has completely different properties.
 Table 5: Top 5 members ordered by HITS X  X  hub score over the social network for the complete topics evaluation for both Creator-oriented network ( type 1 ) and last Reply-oriented network ( type 2 ).
 Table 6: Top 5 members ordered by HITS X  X  hub score over the social network for the  X  X ocal Conflict X  concept for both Creator-oriented network ( type 1 ) and Replier-oriented network ( type 2 ).  X  X ocal Conflicts X  ( type 1 )  X  X ocal Conflicts X  ( type 2 ) In Table 6, top 5 members are listed, but for the  X  X ocal Conflicts X  topic-filtered social network. In this case, the in-formation that Creator-oriented and last Reply-oriented top lists highlights, is that forum members are repeated, show-ing that the  X  X ocal Conflicts X  social network is specially built by posts of specific users (like  X  X ser2 X  and  X  X ser13 X ).
We propose to combine traditional SNA with data min-ing techniques in order to produce results which enable to measure social aspects which are not considered by apply-ing SNA alone. This way, we can obtain results closer to reality when performing further analysis like experts detec-tion, sub-groups detection, centrality measures, among other measures, on any social network, virtual community, VCoP, VCoI, and many other human-based interactions.
 We used our approach to study a VCoI called the Dark Web, for which the Ansar1 forum was used. This forums was collected from Dec 2008 to Jan 2010, and was created by 376 members in 29057 posts. By applying latent Dirichlet alloca-tion (LDA) and using average shortest distances (ASD), we were capable to obtain 47 topics using the closes 30 words on each topic. Afterwards, 11 topics were discarded by inspec-tion. Finally, we used two different topology representations of the forum: a creator-oriented and last reply-oriented net-works.

We showed in which ways SNA alone could be very poor in order to detect key-members which are specifically talking about certain subjects. However, when combining a topic-based text mining approach with SNA we outperforms SNA alone to discover VCoIs X  key members, for which a better analysis of social networks can be performed.

In our experiments, we draw a complete 14 months social network which is quite dense and performed SNA. The in-formation obtained was useless as its visual representation does not helps to identify any patterns. However, using our method, we were able to focus on a specific group of top-ics to create a topic-based network, which provides specific information since it has a lesser density. Then, by using HITS, key members can be extracted from both network configurations, and results also are radically different.
We can say that our proposal can lead to much better re-sults that applying SNA alone. However, as future work the overall evaluation of the top ranked members by the HITS algorithm can be potentiated by experts interviews. Also, by combining other SNA based measures and techniques, such as betweenness centrality scores, weighted-HITS, and HITS authoritative scores, the key-members could be identified with a higher performance. Besides, simple visual inspec-tion of topic-based SNA allow to view a perfect sub-group with key members.

We can say that we have successfully tested our approach and we have shown how to apply it into the Dark Web to discover potential groups of topics (e.g. potential homeland security threats), and key-members that potentiate these topics.
