 In the proposed PhD thesis, it w ill be examined how attention data from the user, especially generated by an eye tracker, can be exploited in order to enhance and personalize information retrieval methods. H.3.1 [ Content Analysis and Indexing ]: Indexing methods, H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Relevance feedback Algorithms, Human Factors Eye tracking, implicit feedback, attention-based index A recent trend in information retrieval research focuses on the consideration of the user X  X  persona l environment in order to better understand the user X  X  needs. Accordingly, the narrower and broader context is taken more and more into account. Because explicit relevance feedback for search results requires a higher effort on the user X  X  side, imp licit feedback methods recently gained in importance, i.e., obs erving the user X  X  actions and environment and trying to infer his/her information needs. Up to now, the main sources for implicit feedback are the user X  X  click-through, scrolling and typing behavior (see [1]); thus, data which is provided by all normally available input devices that are used to interact with a computer. A very interesting new evidence source for implicit feedback are the user X  X  eye movements, so that applying an eye tracker as a new evidence source for the user X  X  attention introduces a potentially very valuable new dimension of contextual information (cf. [2]). In the proposed work, which is qu ite at its beginning, the impact of attention evidence data especially obtained by an eye tracker on information retrieval methods will be examined. Therefore, it will be focused on the following four main topics: In order to get valuable implic it information about the user X  X  current context, it is necessary to register what the user does with documents as precise as possible. An eye tracker will be used to detect those parts of a document th at have been read or skimmed, thus, to which the user has paid attention. By using eye tracking, more precise data about what the user has read can be obtained, e.g., in contrast to merely analyzing the scrolling behavior. An algorithm for reading and skimmi ng detection and differentiation based on eye movement patterns ha s already been developed. An evaluation is planned which shoul d give information about the degree of correlation of several ey e tracking measures and explicit relevance feedback from the user for some document. There is a variety of different us er X  X  actions concerning the usage of documents, e.g., parts of it can be read, skimmed, skipped, commented, highlighted, created, modified, etc. All the interactions with documents impl y different degrees of attention from the user. They will be combined by applying the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence in order to compute a uniform degree of attention for any text passage of a document. The thematic context of the user, i.e., the topic, the user is currently working on, will then be determined by analyzing the sequence of processed document part s and their topical similarity (based on statistical computation). Attention-based modifications of the term-document index will be developed based on user observation results. The idea is to index virtual attention-annotated context documents that c onsist of those parts of the documents which bel ong to one thematic context, and which the user has paid attention to. It will be investigated how the degrees of attention for specific text passages can be incorporated into the term-weigh ting schema of the index. Having such an index enterprise-wide, new types of queries could be posed like  X  X ind a set of docum ents concerning &lt;some topic&gt; which I have not regarded , yet, but which have been used by some colleague in a similar thematic context . X  The general idea is to extract characteristic keywords out of the currently elicited context documen t and to use them for query expansion and result reranking purposes. Therefore, the choice of keywords extracted for query expansion will be influenced by the degree of attention for certain parts of the current virtual attention-annotated context document.
