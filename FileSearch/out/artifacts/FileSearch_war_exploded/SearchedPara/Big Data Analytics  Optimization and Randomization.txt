 Abstract: As the scale and dimensionality of data continue to grow in many applications of data analytics (e.g., bioinformatics, finance, computer vision, medical informatics), it becomes critical to develop efficient and effective algorithms to solv e numerous machine learning and data mining problems. This tutorial will focus on simple yet practically effectiv e techniques and algorithms for big data analytics. In the first part, we plan to present the state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms, including various stochastic gradient descent methods, stochastic coordinate descent methods and distributed optimization algorithms, for solving various machine learning problems. In the second part, we will focus on randomized approximation algorithms for learning from
