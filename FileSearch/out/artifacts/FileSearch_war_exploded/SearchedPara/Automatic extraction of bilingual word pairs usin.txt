 1. Introduction 1.1. Sparse data problem in parallel corpora In the field of Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) ( Chen &amp; Gey, 2004; Fujii &amp; Ishikawa, 2001;
Kishida et al., 2004; Xu &amp; Weischedel, 2003 ), bilingual word pairs X  X he pairs of Source Language (SL) words and Target Language (TL) words X  X re essential. However, manual extraction by humans of bilingual word pairs in various languages is costly. For that reason, automatic extraction of bilingual word pairs from parallel corpora in various languages is important to make the method feasible. Statistical approaches are effective to lou, 1996; Veronis, 2000 ) because they are language independent. However, they are insufficient because of sparse data problem. For example, the system uses cosine ( Manning &amp; Schu  X  tze, 1999 ) to extract bilingual word pairs from a parallel corpus. The cosine is the representative similarity measure in the statistical approaches. The cosine is defined as Table 1 shows the parameters used in function (1) : W S is an SL word and W corpus. The number of pieces in which both W S and W T were found in each bilingual sentence pair is repre-sented as  X  a  X ;  X  b  X  is the number of pieces in which only W the number of pieces in which only W T was found in each bilingual sentence pair. In addition,  X  n  X  represents the total number of words in a parallel corpus;  X  d  X  denotes the values of  X  n ( a + b + c ) X . Fig. 1 shows an example of the sparse data problem by the system based on cosine.

In Fig. 1 , the system based on cosine cannot extract only bilingual word pair (parcel; kozutsumi the similarity value between  X  X  X arcel X  X  and  X  X  kozutsumi  X  X  becomes 0.71, and the similarity value between  X  X  X ar-cel X  X  and  X  X  teburu  X  X  also becomes 0.71 by the cosine function (1) . This problem becomes very serious when the system must deal with various languages because large-scale parallel corpora may be unobtainable in various languages. The frequencies of many bilingual word pairs are same and low when large-scale parallel corpora cannot be obtained. Therefore, it is difficult to automatically extract the bilingual word pairs by the system based on cosine. That is, the system based on cosine has the sparse data problem, and this obstacle is common among similarity measures, not only cosine. 1.2. Motivation
We propose a new learning method for solving the sparse data problem in automatic extraction of bilingual word pairs in various languages. In our learning method, the system limits the search scope for the determi-nation of equivalents by focusing on local parts in bilingual sentence pairs. Fig. 2 shows an example of extrac-tion of a bilingual word pair using our idea.

In Fig. 2 , the rule (your @; anata no @ ) has the information that  X  X  X our X  X  corresponds to  X  X  anata no  X  X  in Jap-anese. Moreover, it has the information that the equivalents of words that adjoin the right side of  X  X  X our X  X  exist tively. The variable  X  X  X  X  X  corresponds to a word. Using the rule (your @; anata no @ ), the system can extract only (parcel; kozutsumi ) from parallel corpus. That is, the system can decrease the number of candidates of equivalents for SL words focusing on local parts in bilingual sentence pairs by the rules. Moreover, from the perspective of learning ( Echizen-ya, Araki, Momouchi, &amp; Tochinai, 2002; Echizen-ya, Araki, &amp; Momou-chi, 2005a, 2005b ), all rules for extracting bilingual word pairs are automatically acquired only from parallel corpus without any bilingual resource. We call this new learning method Inductive Chain Learning (ICL), and the rule acquired by ICL is called the ICL rule. In our method, a chain reaction is caused for the acqui-sition of ICL rules and the extraction of bilingual word pairs. The main advantages of ICL are the following three: (1) The system using ICL requires no bilingual resource (e.g., a bilingual dictionary, a machine translation (2) The system using ICL is effective for parallel corpora with various languages for which the grammatical (3) The system using ICL can extract bilingual word pairs even when the frequency of the bilingual word
Evaluation experiments indicated that the system using ICL could extract not only high-frequency bilingual word pairs but also low-frequency bilingual word pairs from parallel corpora with various languages. 1.3. Related work Several methods based on co-occurrence words are proposed ( Fung, 1995, 1998; Kaji &amp; Aizono, 1996;
Rapp, 1995, 1999; Tanaka &amp; Iwasaki, 1996 ). These methods use the co-occurrence words to bilingual word pairs in bilingual sentence pairs. However, they depend on a pre-existing bilingual dictionary. Therefore, it is difficult to extract bilingual word pairs with various languages when a sufficient bilingual dictionary does not exist beforehand.

Methods based on large-scale bilingual resources are also proposed. For instance, Kumano and Hirakawa (1994) proposed a method that utilizes both statistical information and linguistic information to obtain cor-responding words or phrases in a parallel corpus ( Kumano &amp; Hirakawa, 1994 ). To cite another example, Uts-uro, Hino, and Kida (2004) proposed a method that acquires low-frequency bilingual terms using bilingual for that system to deal with various languages because of the use of large-scale bilingual resources.
Regarding methods for acquisition templates, Gu  X  venir and Cicekli (1998) and McTait (2001) proposed methods that acquire templates by replacing common parts with variables or replacing different parts with many similar bilingual sentence pairs to extract sufficient templates because they do not focus on local parts in bilingual sentence pairs.

The method based on frequency of bilingual word pairs, K-vec ( Fung &amp; Church, 1994; Pedersen &amp; Varma, 2003 ), is unable to extract low-frequency bilingual word pairs. That method is based on the fact that two words occur an almost equal number of times if they are translations of each other. However, the algorithm is applied only to bilingual word pairs for which the frequency is greater than three, except one and two. Moreover, statistical word-alignment methods ( Ahrenberg, Andersson, &amp; Merkel, 1998; Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, &amp; Mercer, 1993; Dagan, Church, &amp; Gale, 1993; Hiemstra, de Jong, &amp; Kraaij, 1997; been proposed, but they are also insufficient. That is, they cannot also extract low-frequency bilingual word pairs even though they are language-independent. Yamada and Knight (2001) proposed a phrase-based alignment method ( Yamada &amp; Knight, 2001 ). This method requires syntactical analysis systems for both
SL sentences and TL sentences. Consequently, it is difficult to deal with languages for which syntactical anal-ysis systems are not sufficiently obtainable.

Sentence-alignment methods based on word-alignment have also been proposed. Chen (1993) proposed an algorithm for sentence alignment that uses lexical information ( Chen, 1993 ). Gale and Church (1993) proposed a method for aligning sentences based on a simple statistical model of character lengths ( Gale &amp; Church, 1993 ). Zhao, Zechner, Vogel, and Waibel (2003) proposed a method for automatically optimiz-ing the alignment scores of such a bilingual sentence alignment program ( Zhao et al., 2003 ). This method is based on the statistical translation models presented by Brown et al. (1993) . However, these methods, which are based on the appearance frequency of words, cannot extract low-frequency bilingual word pairs because of the data sparseness problem. Moreover, Matsumoto, Ishimoto, and Utsuro (1993) Collier, Ono, and
Hirakawa (1998) proposed a method that can extract bilingual word pairs from parallel corpora with lan-guages for which the grammatical structures of SL differ from the grammatical structures of TL ( Matsu-moto et al., 1993; Collier et al., 1998 ). These methods depend on a pre-existing bilingual dictionary.
Therefore, it is difficult to obtain bilingual word pairs with various languages when the bilingual resource is insufficient.

For information extraction from semi-structured documents such as HTML and XML, many systems based on templates ( Appelt, Hobbs, Bear, Israel, &amp; Tyson, 1993; Hsu &amp; Yih, 1997; Kushmerick, Weld, &amp;
Doorenbos, 1997; Lee &amp; Bui, 2000 ) have been examined. For acquisition of templates, the template detection algorithms using frequency information ( Bar-Yossef &amp; Rajagopalan, 2002; Hirokawa, Itoh, &amp; Miyahara, 2003; Yamada, Ikeda, &amp; Hirokawa, 2002 ) have been put forth. Crescenzi, Mecca, and Merialdo (2001) pro-posed a method that generates a wrapper using similarities and differences in HTML pages ( Crescenzi et al., 2001 ). However, in web sites, it is comparatively easy to generate templates because HTML and XML are semi-structured documents. In contrast, natural language sentences include various linguistic phenomena. Furthermore, the system must determine word correspondence among different languages in the extraction of bilingual word pairs. Our method is very effective because it can automatically acquire ICL rules as tem-plates for natural language sentences that are not semi-structured documents.

Our system can extract bilingual word pairs with various frequencies without requiring any bilingual resource beforehand. It is able to do so through the use of ICL rules that are acquired automatically only from a parallel corpus. 2. Outline
Fig. 3 shows an outline of a system using ICL. In Fig. 3 , ICL is shown as its four constituent processes: the process based on two bilingual sentence pairs; the process based on SL words; the process based on ICL rules; and the determination process of bilingual word pairs. These processes must be executed sequentially even though each process is independent.

First, the system acquires ICL rules by performing the process based on two bilingual sentence pairs. This process uses only a parallel corpus, and it is executed only one time to a parallel corpus. Therefore, the system performs this process first. Similarity values in all acquired ICL rules are assigned using the cosine function (1) , and the acquired ICL rules are registered to an ICL rule dictionary. Then the user inputs SL words of bilingual word pairs. In the process based on SL words, the system obtains ICL rules and bilingual word pairs for SL words using bilingual sentence pairs for which SL words exist. This process uses SL words and a par-allel corpus. It is executed every time SL words are inputted. Similarity values between SL words and TL words in all extracted bilingual word pairs are also assigned using the cosine function (1) . The extracted bilin-gual word pairs are used as input data in the determination process of bilingual word pairs. The acquired ICL rules are registered to the ICL rule dictionary. All ICL rules are acquired in the process based on two bilingual sentence pairs and the process based on SL words. The system must acquire ICL rules to the greatest extent possible because it extracts bilingual word pairs using the acquired ICL rules. The process based on two bilin-gual sentence pairs is effective for acquiring many ICL rules because ICL rules are acquired from various bilin-gual sentence pairs in a parallel corpus. In contrast, in the process based on SL words, ICL rules are acquired only from the bilingual sentence pairs for which SL words exist.
 In the process based on ICL rules, using the acquired ICL rules, the system extracts bilingual word pairs for
SL words from bilingual sentence pairs for which SL words exist. This process uses SL words, a parallel cor-pus and ICL rules, and it is executed every time SL words are inputted. The extracted bilingual word pairs are also used as input data in the determination process of bilingual word pairs. In the determination process of bilingual word pairs, the system determines the most suitable bilingual word pairs among the bilingual word pairs extracted by the process based on SL words and the process based on ICL rules. In that case, the system process uses the extracted bilingual word pairs, ICL rules and a parallel corpus. It is executed every time the bilingual word pairs for SL words are obtained in the process based on SL words and the process based on ICL rules.

Moreover, the system compares the similarity values of the bilingual word pairs chosen by the determina-tion process of bilingual word pairs with a threshold value. Consequently, the system registers the chosen bilingual word pairs to the dictionary for bilingual word pairs when their respective similarity values are greater than the threshold value. On the other hand, when the similarity values of the chosen bilingual word pairs are not greater than the threshold or when no bilingual word pairs are obtained in the above ICL, i.e., when ICL cannot acquire sufficient ICL rules, the system extracts bilingual word pairs from all bilingual sen-tence pairs for which SL words exist using one similarity measure by the process based on similarity measure.
This process uses SL words and a parallel corpus. It is executed every time SL words are inputted. In this with the highest similarity values are chosen. They are then registered to the dictionary for bilingual word pairs. 3. Processes 3.1. Process based on two bilingual sentence pairs
The system first performs the process based on two bilingual sentence pairs to acquire many ICL rules. This system obtains ICL rules using common parts and different parts between two bilingual sentence pairs in a parallel corpus. This fact indicates that the system does not require bilingual resources to acquire ICL rules.
Therefore, the system using ICL can extract bilingual word pairs between various languages. The determina-tion of common parts and different parts is based on character strings of bilingual sentence pairs. Therefore, it is simple word matching. The use of such a technique realizes a learning system that can acquire knowledge from various data dynamically without using pre-existing statistical knowledge. The system possesses high learning ability when it can extract bilingual word pairs of various languages without requiring any bilingual resources. The ICL is the method that imparts learning ability to the system. The details of the process based on two bilingual sentence pairs are the following:
P1-(1) The system selects two bilingual sentence pairs that have SLCPs and TLCPs from a parallel corpus.
P1-(2) The system determines SLDPs using SLCPs, and extracts only SLDPs for which the number of words
P1-(3) The system determines TLDPs using TLCPs, and extracts only TLDPs that correspond to independent P1-(4) The system acquires ICL rules using extracted SLDPs and TLDPs only when the number of extracted
The system determines SLCPs, SLDPs, TLCPs and TLDPs using only character strings of two bilingual sentences without part-of-speech information or syntactical information. Therefore, their units (i.e., SLCPs,
SLDPs, TLCPs and TLDPs) are various. In SLCPs and TLCPs, the minimum unit is a word. When the com-mon words appear continuously between two bilingual sentence pairs, the unit becomes a word string. In
SLDPs and TLDPs, the unit of most extracted SLDPs is a word because the system extracts only SLDPs for which the number of words is less than 3 by P1-(2). Also, the unit of all extracted TLDPs is a word because the system extracts only TLDPs that correspond to independent words by P1-(3).

Furthermore, in P1-(1), the selection process of two bilingual sentence pairs that have SLCPs is performed using combinations of all bilingual sentence pairs in a parallel corpus. However, the selection process of two bilingual sentence pairs that have TLCPs is performed using the combination of only bilingual sentence pairs that have SLCPs, not the combination of all bilingual sentence pairs. Therefore, the comparative process for
TL sentences is limited. Moreover, the process based on two bilingual sentence pairs that includes P1-(1) is executed to a parallel corpus only one time, not every time SL words are inputted, as in other processes shown as examples in Fig. 3 .

Fig. 4 gives an example of extraction of SLDPs and TLDPs in the process based on two bilingual sentence pairs. First, the system selects two bilingual sentence pairs that have SLCPs (the common parts between two
SL sentences) and TLCPs (the common parts between two TL sentences) by P1-(1). As shown in Fig. 4 , the sys-and SLCP 2 in SL sentences. In TL sentences,  X  X  kono  X  X  and  X  X  wa  X  X  become TLCP system then determines SLDPs (the different parts between two SL sentences) using SLCPs, and extracts SLDPs for my children to study X  X  are determined as SLDP 1 1 and SLDP
SLCP 1 ( X  X  X his X  X ) and SLCP 2 ( X  X  X s X  X ), and  X  X  X he room for my children to study X  X  adjoins the right side of SLCP ( X  X  X s X  X ). In the SL sentence of bilingual sentence pair 2,  X  X  X ame X  X  and  X  X  X ery popular in England X  X  are determined as SLDP 2 1 and SLDP 2 2 , respectively, because  X  X  X ame X  X  exists between SLCP popular in England X  X  adjoins the right side of SLCP 2 ( X  X  X s X  X ). However, only SLDP ( X  X  X ame X  X ), for which the number of words is less than 3, are extracted as SLDPs from the SL sentences of bilin-gual sentence pairs 1 and 2. The SLDP 1 2 ( X  X  X he room for my children to study X  X ) and SLDP England X  X ) are not extracted as SLDPs because the respective numbers of words in them are greater than 3.
Fig. 5 portrays the extraction algorithm of SLDPs. The processes of lines 4 and 10 of Fig. 5 represent the extraction process of SLDPs that adjoin the left side of SLCP extraction process of SLDPs between two SLCPs. In lines 13 and 15, obtains the number of combinations based on two SLCPs. Here, NSLCP is the number of SLCPs. Moreover, the processes of lines 25 and 29 represent the extraction process of SLDPs that adjoin the right side of SLCP NSLCP . In that case, the number of words in all extracted SLDPs must be less than 3.

Moreover, the system extracts TLDPs (the different parts between two TL sentences) from two TL sen-tences by P1-(3). The system determines TLDPs using TLCPs same as the extraction process of SLDPs. In the TL sentence of bilingual sentence pair 1 of Fig. 4 , X  X  heya  X  X  and  X  X  kodomo tachi no benkyo beya desu  X  X  are  X  X  eikoku de totemo konoma re te i ru  X  X  are determined as TLDP phrases, not independent words. Therefore, only TLDP 1 1 ( X  X  heya  X  X ) and TLDP nouns, are extracted as TLDPs from the TL sentences of bilingual sentence pairs 1 and 2.

Consequently, in bilingual sentence pair 1, the number of extracted SLDPs is equal to the number of extracted TLDPs because the number of extracted SLDPs is 1 ( X  X  X oom X  X ) and the number of extracted TLDPs is also 1 ( X  X  heya  X  X ). Therefore, the system performs the acquisition process of ICL rules to bilingual sentence pair 1 in the following process of P2. In bilingual sentence pair 2, the number of extracted SLDPs is equal to the number of extracted TLDPs because the number of extracted SLDPs is 1 ( X  X  X ame X  X ) and the number of extracted TLDPs is also 1 ( X  X  gemu  X  X ). Therefore, the system performs the acquisition process of ICL rules to bilingual sentence pair 2.

Fig. 6 gives the extraction algorithm of TLDPs. The processes of lines 4 and 10 of Fig. 6 represent the extraction process of TLDPs that adjoins the left side of TLCP the extraction process of TLDPs between two TLCPs. Moreover, the processes of lines 25 and 29 represent the extraction process of TLDPs that adjoin the right side of TLCP correspond to independent words.

The system then generates ICL rules using SLCPs, TLCPs, SLDPs and TLDPs by P1-(4). Details of gene-ration processes of ICL rules are the following: P2-(1) The system replaces the extracted SLDPs and TLDPs with variables in bilingual sentence pairs. P2-(2) The system extracts the pairs of each SLCP and variable, and the pairs of each TLCP and variable.
P2-(3) The system generates ICL rules by combining the extracted pairs of SLCPs and variables with the P2-(4) The system calculates the similarity values between SLCPs and TLCPs in the generated ICL rules.
Fig. 7 gives generation examples of ICL rules using this process. In Fig. 7 , the system generates ICL rules from bilingual sentence pairs 1 and 2 shown in Fig. 4 . First, the system replaces the extracted SLDPs ( X  X  X oom X  X ,
Consequently, the system extracts the pairs of each SLCP and variable ( X  X  X his @ X  X ,  X  X  X  is X  X ), and the pairs of each TLCP and variable ( X  X  kono @  X  X ,  X  X  @wa  X  X ) by P2-(2). Based on the combinations of all extracted pairs, (this @; kono @ ), (@ is; kono @ ), (this @; @wa ) and (@ is; @wa ) are generated as ICL rules by P2-(3). More-over, the similarity values between SLCPs and TLCPs in the generated ICL rules are calculated using the cosine function (1) by P2-(4). The similarity values of (this @; kono @ ) and (@ is; @wa ) are higher than those
SL parts; the parts extracted from TL sentences are called TL parts. 3.2. Process based on SL words
The system performs the process based on SL words to acquire ICL rules from the bilingual sentence pairs for which SL words exist in a parallel corpus. At the same time, the system extracts the bilingual word pairs for
SL words. This process requires SL words and a parallel corpus, and it is performed every time SL words are inputted. The details of the process based on SL words are the following:
P3-(1) The system selects bilingual sentence pairs for which SL words exist from a parallel corpus. Moreover,
P3-(2) The system determines TLDP m =1,2,3, ... (the different parts between two TL sentences) using TLCPs, P3-(3) The system obtains bilingual word pairs by combining SL words with the extracted TLDPs.
P3-(4) The system acquires ICL rules. The details of this process are the following: (iii) The system generates ICL rules by combining the extracted pairs of SLCPs and variables with the (iv) The system calculates the similarity values between SLCPs and TLCPs in the acquired ICL rules.
In P3-(1), the selection process of the bilingual sentence pairs for which SL words exist is performed by searching the bilingual sentence pairs for which SL words exist among all bilingual sentence pairs in the par-allel corpus. The selection process of the bilingual sentence pairs that have SLCPs is performed using the com-binations of the bilingual sentence pairs that SL words exist and other bilingual sentence pairs, not the combinations of all bilingual sentence pairs in the parallel corpus. Moreover, the selection process of bilingual sentence pairs that have TLCPs is performed using the combinations of the bilingual sentence pairs for which SL words exist and the bilingual sentence pairs that have SLCPs.

Fig. 8 gives an example of acquisition of ICL rules and bilingual word pairs in the process based on SL words. First, the system selects the bilingual sentence pairs for which SL words exist and the bilingual sentence pairs that have SLCPs and TLCPs as bilingual sentence pairs for which SL words exist by P3-(1). In Fig. 8 , the system selects bilingual sentence pair 1 for which the SL word  X  X  X he British Museum X  X  exists. Moreover, the fore,  X  X  X o X  X  becomes SLCP 1 in SL sentences. In TL sentences,  X  X  wa  X  X ,  X  X  ni  X  X  and  X  X  ta  X  X  become TLCP
TLCP 3 , respectively. The system then determines TLDPs using TLCPs, and extracts TLDPs from the bilin-gual sentence pairs for which SL words exist by P3-(2). In the TL sentence of bilingual sentence pair 1 of and  X  X  tokoro desu  X  X  are determined as TLDP 1 , TLDP 2 , TLDP  X  X  akiko  X  X  adjoins the left side of TLCP 1 ( X  X  wa  X  X ),  X  X  dai ei hakubutsukan  X  X  exists between TLCP
TLCP 2 ( X  X  ni  X  X ),  X  X  dai ei hakubutsukan ni hito ri de tadoritsui  X  X  exist between TLCP ( X  X  ta  X  X ),  X  X  hito ri de tadoritsui  X  X  exist between TLCP right side of TLCP 3 ( X  X  ta  X  X ).

Fig. 9 gives the extraction algorithm of TLDPs in P3-(2). The processes of lines 2 and 8 of Fig. 9 represent the extraction process of TLDPs that adjoin the left side of TLCP the extraction process of TLDPs between two TLCPs. The processes of lines 23 and 27 represent the extraction process of TLDPs that adjoin the right side of TLCP NTLCP to independent words.

Among the five TLDPs in Fig. 8 , only TLDP 1 ( X  X  akiko  X  X ) and TLDP because they are independent words. The other three TLDPs are verb phrases, not independent words. The system obtains bilingual word pairs by combining SL words with the extracted TLDPs by P3-(3). In Fig. 8 , (the British Museum; dai ei hakubutsukan ) and (the British Museum; akiko ) are obtained as the bilingual word pairs by combining the SL word ( X  X  X he British Museum X  X ) with two extracted TLDPs ( X  X  akiko  X  X ,  X  X  dai ei hakubutsukan  X  X ). Moreover, the system generates ICL rules by P3-(4). In Fig. 8 , the system obtains (to @; @ni ), (to @; wa @ ) and (to @; @wa ) as ICL rules. The similarity value of (to @; @ni ) is higher than the 3.3. Process based on ICL rules
In the process based on ICL rules, using the acquired ICL rules, the system extracts bilingual word pairs from bilingual sentence pairs in a parallel corpus. The system limits the search scope for determination of equivalents in TL sentences by focusing on the local parts of bilingual sentence pairs. Moreover, the system can efficiently extract bilingual word pairs using ICL rules because ICL rules have information about the word order between SL and TL. This process needs SL words, a parallel corpus and ICL rules, and it is performed every time SL words are inputted. In addition, this process is based on the position of variables in ICL rules.

Fig. 10 shows examples of extraction of bilingual word pairs in the process based on ICL rules. In example over, the system selects ICL rule 1 (this @; kono @ ) from the ICL rule dictionary. The SL part  X  X  X his X  X  of ICL rule 1 exists in the SL sentence of bilingual sentence pair 1. In addition, the variable  X  X  X  X  X  corresponds to SL word 1  X  X  X ish X  X  because both variable  X  X  X  X  X  and the SL word 1  X  X  X ish X  X  adjoin the right side of SLCP ( X  X  X his X  X ). of bilingual sentence pair 1 as the independent word that corresponds to the variable  X  X  X  X  X  in the TL part of
ICL rule 1. In this manner, the system can obtain (fish; sakana ) as the noun bilingual word pair. It then cal-are extracted using ICL rule 2 (to @; @ni ), which was acquired in Fig. 8 . In this example, the system extracts as the independent words that correspond to variable  X  X  X  X  X  in the TL part of ICL rule 2.

Fig. 11 gives the extraction algorithm of bilingual word pairs using ICL rules. The processes of lines 3 and 9 of Fig. 11 represent the extraction process of bilingual word pairs using ICL rules for which the variables @ )in Fig. 10 . Also, the processes of lines 10 and 16 represent the extraction process of bilingual word pairs using ICL rules for which the variables adjoin the left side of TLCP in TL parts. By this process, the system extracts (get; noru ) and (get; densha ) using (to @; @ni )in Fig. 10 .

Moreover, the system calculates the similarity values between SL words and the independent words extracted from TL sentences using the cosine function (1) by line 19 of Fig. 11 . In example 2 of Fig. 10 , the similarity value between  X  X  X et X  X  and  X  X  noru  X  X  is higher than the similarity value between  X  X  X et X  X  and  X  X  densha  X  X  because  X  X  X et X  X  corresponds to  X  X  densha  X  X , not  X  X  noru  X  X  in Japanese. Thereby, only (get; noru )is selected as the bilingual word pair, and it is registered to the dictionary for bilingual word pairs. Details of the determination process for the most suitable bilingual word pairs using the similarity values are given in Section 3.4 .

Using the acquired ICL rules, the system can decrease the number of candidates of equivalents for SL and  X  X  itadakeru  X  X ) in the TL sentence of bilingual sentence pair 2 become the candidates of equivalents for
Moreover, ICL rules have the knowledge to cope with the different word order between SL and TL in the local parts of bilingual sentence pairs. For example, in the SL part of ICL rule 2 (to @; @ni ), the variable  X  X  X  X  X  system can extract bilingual word pairs from parallel corpora with various languages for which the grammat-ical structures of SL differ from the grammatical structures of TL. 3.4. Determination process of bilingual word pairs
The system determines the most suitable bilingual word pairs according to their similarity values and the word pairs, ICL rules and a parallel corpus. It is executed every time the bilingual word pairs for SL words are obtained in the process based on SL words and the process based on ICL rules. Details of this process are the following:
P4-(1) The system selects the bilingual word pairs with the highest similarity values among all extracted
P4-(2) The system selects the bilingual word pairs that were extracted using ICL rules with the highest sim-
P4-(3) The system selects the bilingual word pairs with the TL words that appear in a parallel corpus for the 3.5. Process based on similarity measure
In the process based on similarity measure, the system extracts bilingual word pairs for SL words from bilingual sentence pairs for which SL words exist using each similarity measure without using ICL only when the similarity values are not greater than the threshold value or when no bilingual word pairs are obtained.
That is, this process is needed when sufficient ICL rules cannot be acquired. Also, this process requires SL words and a parallel corpus; it is executed every time SL words are inputted. In this paper, the cosine, Dice coefficient, LLR and Yates X  v 2 are used respectively as similarity measures. Details of this process are the following: P5-(1) The system selects the bilingual word pairs for which SL words exist from a parallel corpus. P5-(2) The system obtains candidates of equivalents for SL words by extracting all independent words from P5-(3) The system calculates the similarity values between SL words and each extracted independent word.
P5-(4) The system chooses the pairs of SL words and independent words, for which the similarity values are
P5-(5) The system selects the bilingual word pairs with the TL words that appear at the first time in a parallel
In this process, the system can obtain bilingual word pairs for SL words whenever the independent words exist in TL sentences of bilingual sentence pairs. In that case, all independent words in TL sentences of bilin-gual sentence pairs for which SL words exist become candidates of equivalents. This fact indicates that it is difficult to solve the sparse data problem, as described in Section 1.1 .

In this study, the cosine, Dice coefficient, LLR or Yates X  v based on similarity measure. The cosine, Dice coefficient are measures based on comparison of two vectors.
The LLR and Yates X  v 2 are measures based on comparison of two probability values. Measures based on a comparison of two vectors indicate the ratio of two probabilities: the probability that both W and the probability that W S or W T occurs along with the other. In this process, W
SL word and each independent word, respectively. The cosine was defined already as function (1) in Section 1.1 . The Dice coefficient is defined as word pairs is high when the score is large for both the cosine and Dice coefficient.
 Measures based on comparison of two probability values indicate whether the appearance of W independent or dependent. The LLR is defined as the following. The LLR represents the ratio of two probabilities: the probability that W ability that W S and W T are independent of each other. The LLR score becomes 0.0 when W pletely independent. Another measure, the v 2 statistic, indicates the differences between observed and expected values. The Yates X  v 2 is the measure that the expected value is revised with when the expected frequencies are low. The Yates X  v 2 is defined as the following.
 4. Experiments for performance evaluation 4.1. Experimental procedure Five kinds of parallel corpora are used in this study as experimental data. These parallel corpora are for
English X  X apanese, French X  X apanese, German X  X apanese, Shanghai-Chinese X  X apanese and Ainu
They were taken from textbooks ( Chikushi, 2001; Emoto &amp; Han, 2004; Harukawa &amp; Snelling, 1998; Nakag-awa &amp; Nakamoto, 2004; Oshio, 2004 ). The number of bilingual sentence pairs was 1794; the average numbers of words in SL sentences and TL sentences were 6.8 and 8.8, respectively. We inputted all 1081 SL words in five parallel corpora into eight systems: the system based on cosine, the system based on cosine in which ICL is used (herein, we call it the system based on cosine + ICL), the system based on Dice coefficient, the system based on Dice coefficient in which ICL is used (herein, we call it the system based on Dice + ICL), the system based on LLR, the system based on LLR in which ICL is used (herein, we call it the system based on
LLR + ICL), the system based on Yates X  v 2 , and the system based on Yates X  v we call it the system based on Yates + ICL). We applied ICL to various similarity measures to confirm the effectiveness of ICL. The initial conditions of all dictionaries are empty. Experiments were repeated for each parallel corpus using each system. In the system using ICL, 0.5 is adopted as its best threshold. systems based only on similarity measure (i.e., the systems based on cosine, Dice coefficient, LLR and Yates X  v ) correspond to the systems that only process based on similarity measure as described in Section 3.5 is used. 4.2. Evaluation standard We evaluated whether correct bilingual word pairs are obtained or not, and calculated the recall for all 1081 SL words using function (5) .

By function (5) , the number of all correct bilingual word pairs in parallel corpora represents the sum of all nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and conjunctions in the parallel corpora: 1081. 4.3. Experimental results
Table 2 shows experimental results in measures based on comparison of two vectors. In Table 2 , all TL in every parallel corpus are Japanese. The recall of the system based on cosine + ICL was more than 5.9% points higher than that of the system based on cosine. Moreover, the recall of the system based on Dice + ICL was more than 7.6% points higher than that of the system based on Dice coefficient. These results indicate that ICL is effective for measures based on comparison of two vectors.

Table 3 shows experimental results for measures based on comparison of two probability values. The recall values of the systems using ICL were more than 4.6% points higher than those of the systems based on LLR and Yates X  v 2 . These results indicate that ICL is also effective for measures based on comparison of two prob-ability values.

On the other hand, in our method, the precision values by function (6) are unobtainable because the num-ber of all extracted bilingual word pairs in the dictionary for bilingual word pairs means only the number of bilingual word pairs that have the highest similarity values, not all bilingual word pairs extracted by the system using ICL in Fig. 3 . The system chooses only one bilingual word pair ranked the highest among all ranked bilingual word pairs when several candidates of bilingual word pairs are obtained for each SL word. It then registers the chosen bilingual word pair to the dictionary. Therefore, the number of all extracted bilingual word pairs in the dictionary corresponds only to the number of bilingual word pairs ranked the highest. This fact indicates that the number of bilingual word pairs in the dictionary is less than the number of SL words inputted by the user in the system using ICL.
 4.4. Discussion
We investigated the ratio of correctly extracted bilingual word pairs for which the frequency was 1 to all correct bilingual word pairs for which the frequency was 1. In the systems without ICL, many bilingual word pairs for which the frequency was 1 were extracted as erroneous bilingual word pairs because of data sparse-ness problems, as described in Section 1.1 . Therefore, the extraction of many correct bilingual word pairs for which the frequency is 1 indicates that ICL is effective to solve the sparse data problem. Table 4 shows the details of the ratios in respective frequencies of bilingual word pairs in measures based on comparison of two vectors. The ratio of correctly extracted bilingual word pairs for which the frequency is 1 improved 9.6% points, on average, using ICL. The ratio of correctly extracted bilingual word pairs for which the fre-quency is greater than 2 to all correct bilingual word pairs for which the frequency is greater than 2 improved 2.0% points on average. In measures based on comparisons of two probability values, the ratio of correctly extracted bilingual word pairs for which the frequency is 1 improved 7.0% points on average using ICL.
The ratio of correctly extracted bilingual word pairs for which the frequency is greater than 2 improved 0.7% points on average. Therefore, we confirmed that ICL is effective to solve the sparse data problem because the system using ICL could extract many bilingual word pairs for which the frequency is 1, comparing the system without ICL.

Table 5 shows examples of bilingual word pairs extracted by ICL.
English. By examples in Table 5 , we can confirm that the system using ICL can extract not only bilingual word pairs that the number of words is 1, but also bilingual word pairs that the number of words is greater than 2, e.g., (post office; yubin kyoku ).

Table 6 shows the recall values by only ICL. This result means the experimental result of the system without the recalls are high among all parallel corpora, and the ratios of correct bilingual word pairs for which the frequency is 1 to all correct bilingual word pairs are low. In contrast, in English X  X apanese and French X  Japanese parallel corpus, the recalls are low and the ratios of correct bilingual word pairs for which the frequency is 1 are high. In ICL, the words or word strings for which the frequency is 1 are not used as ICL rules because the common parts, for which the frequency is greater than 2, are used as ICL rules. Therefore, it is difficult to acquire ICL rules when the ratio of correct bilingual word pairs for which the frequency is 1 is high. Furthermore, the system using ICL acquires not only correct ICL rules and bilingual word pairs but also erroneous ICL rules and bilingual word pairs. Fig. 12 gives examples of the acquisition of an erroneous ICL rule and the extraction of erroneous bilingual word pair. In the acquisition of ICL rules of Fig. 12 , (@ to; @ wo ) was acquired as an erroneous ICL rule because of the omission by the set phrase. In bilingual sentence pair ted in Japanese because  X  X  X s going to X  X  is the set phrase. As the result, the erroneous ICL rule (@ to; @wo ) was acquired, and (job; hanashi ) was extracted as erroneous bilingual word pair from bilingual sentence pair 3 using use the bilingual word pairs extracted previously. That is, the system determines the equivalent omitted by the set phrase using the extracted bilingual word pairs in the dictionary for bilingual word pairs when it acquires ICL rules.

Moreover, we applied ICL to GIZA++ (herein, we call it the system based on GIZA++ + ICL) by replac-ing the process based on similarity measure with GIZA++ in Fig. 3 . The GIZA++ is the statistical word-alignment model ( Och, 2000 ). Table 7 shows results of evaluation experiments in GIZA++. In the system based on GIZA++, the recalls are very low in English X  X apanese, French X  X apanese, and German X  X apanese parallel corpora. This result indicates that GIZA++ is insufficient when the grammatical structures of SL dif-fer from the grammatical structures of TL, and when the frequencies of many bilingual word pairs are extre-mely low. On the other hand, in Shanghai-Chinese X  X apanese and Ainu X  X apanese parallel corpora, the recall values were lower through the use of ICL. In the system based on GIZA++ + ICL, GIZA++ that corre-sponds to the process based on similarity measure is not executed when the bilingual word pairs with the high-est similarity values are obtained by ICL (i.e., the process based on two bilingual sentence pairs, the process based on SL words, the process based on ICL rules; and the determination process of bilingual word pairs).
This fact indicates that the recall value of the system based on GIZA++ + ICL is lower when ICL extracts erroneous bilingual word pairs with the highest similarity values and when GIZA++ can extract many correct bilingual word pairs. In Shanghai-Chinese X  X apanese and Ainu X  X apanese parallel corpora, ICL extracted some erroneous bilingual word pairs with the highest similarity values. Furthermore, GIZA++ extracted many cor-rect bilingual word pairs because the grammatical structures of Shanghai-Chinese and Ainu are similar to the grammatical structure of Japanese. Therefore, the recall values of the system based on GIZA++ + ICL low-ered to the recall values of the system based on GIZA++ in Shanghai-Chinese X  X apanese and Ainu X  X apanese parallel corpora. The grammatical structure of Ainu is SOV, and the grammatical structure of Japanese is also
SOV. Although the grammatical structure of Shanghai-Chinese is SVO, the grammatical structure of Shang-hai-Chinese is similar to the grammatical structure of Japanese in terms of phrase units (e.g., noun phrase), if not in terms of overall sentences. The recall values improved in English X  X apanese, French X  X apanese, and Ger-man X  X apanese parallel corpora through the use of ICL. This fact indicates that ICL is effective in the auto-matic extraction of bilingual word pairs from the parallel corpora with languages for which the grammatical structures of SL differ from the grammatical structures of TL. 5. Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed Inductive Chain Learning (ICL) as a new learning method for extracting bilin-gual word pairs from parallel corpora with various languages. The system using ICL can automatically extract bilingual word pairs using only parallel corpora without any prior preparation of a bilingual resource (e.g., a bilingual dictionary, a machine translation system). Moreover, the system using ICL can extract bilingual word pairs from parallel corpora with various languages for which grammatical structures of SL differ from the grammatical structures of TL. In addition, the system using ICL can extract not only high-frequency bilin-gual word pairs, but also low-frequency bilingual word pairs. Evaluation experiments indicated that the sys-tem using ICL is very effective to extract bilingual word pairs with various languages and to solve the sparse data problem.

Future studies will solve the problem of word-ambiguity. Moreover, we will apply our method to a multi-lingual machine translation system and a cross-language information retrieval system.
