 Current university emergency al ert systems use email, text messages, and automated phone ca lls to contact people about incidents that occur. One major goal of these systems is to reassure university community members that administrators are aware of emergencies and are in control. These generic alerts, however, can cause panic because it increases concern for the safety of family and friends. Furthermore, people receive alerts that are irrelevant based on thei r current location. This poster describes an emergency alert sy stem that provides personalized information to users. R U OK? , a SMS-based service, distributes emergency alert information along w ith status updates of those in one X  X  close social network. By providing personalized information, the system aims to increase feelings of safety and sense of community. H5.3.

 Design, Human Factors emergency alert systems, safety, social networks Due to a spike in university shootings, safety has become an increased concern on college cam puses [2, 3]. College students are worried about becoming victimized on campus [1]. Female students are fearful and tend to constrain their behavior (e.g., where and when they go somewhere) to avoid becoming victims of crimes on campus [5]. Email and text-based emergency re sponse systems, used by many universities, attempt to address these fears [4]. The goal of these systems is to alert members of the community about real-time emergencies (e.g., crimes). De pending on the severity of the emergency, different modes of communication are used to send alerts (e.g., text messages, em ails, phone calls). University emergency response systems are fa irly new and have not been studied extensively. Wu, Qu, and Preece, however, found that people are not adopting university emergency alert systems that send automated messages, because the messages are not personalized [6]. Though the objective of current university emergency alert systems is to make people feel safe and informed, many feel a heightened sense of fear, especi ally when reports of violent crimes occur. Also, people become annoyed when receiving blanket messages cont aining general information that is not tailored to them. Current designs of emergency alert systems decrease perceptions of safety, which suggests the need for different methods of providi ng emergency information. In this poster, I describe R U OK? , an emergency alert system that sends mobile text messages with status information of one X  X  closest family and friends base d on location. I hypothesize that receiving personalized messages increases perceptions of safety and sense of community. First, to understand current percep tions of safety and sense of community in the university setting, I conducted two focus groups. Twelve students and three faculty members from the same university participated; six were male. Participants were asked about their perception of safety on campus and sense of community. I then asked particip ants to recall the last major incident in which they received a message from the university alert system. They were asked to write a paragraph about the event in question. They provided details about where they were when they first heard about the incident, the technology that first alerted them, and how they felt when they received the alert. They were also asked general behavior al questions such as how safe they feel in their neighborhood, on campus, etc. The results were analyzed and informed the design of R U OK? . Perceptions of Safety. People said that they felt relatively safe but emergency alert messages cause d them to be concerned for their close friends on campus. Women reported feeling nervous or afraid when receiving messages from multiple modes of communication about one incide nt. For example, a student recalled receiving a phone call, text message, and email at the same time from the emergenc y alert system. Although the message was about an incident at a remote campus location nearly fifteen miles away, she became very concerned for the safety of herself and her close friends. Male s were more likely to ignore the messages and did not report bei ng afraid for their safety. Sense of Community. Participants said that they felt a sense of community at the university; however, the current emergency alert system did not enhance feelings of community. Some administrators after an incident occurs on campus as attempts to increase sense of community, but they did not believe it helped. Context. Despite the location of the incident, people received messages when there were no immediate concerns for their safety, which resulted in feelings of annoyance or panic. People complained about receiving messa ges regarding incidents that were far away from them. In th e example mentioned above, the student felt she did not need to receive alerts via text messaging or phone call, which are more obt rusive modes of communication, for an incident that was not near her. The goal of the system is to deliver personalized information that is based on small user defined social networks. R U OK? utilizes short message services (SMS) to provide users with emergency information along with status updates about members in their close social network. emergency network by entering in the email addresses of up to four people. After a user finalizes his or her emergency network, each person is invited via email to accept or decline an invitation to join someone X  X  emergency ne twork. Additionally, they are asked for their mobile phone number and if they would like to add others to their emergency network. Therefore, each person has complete autonomy over his or her emergency network. When an emergency occurs, R U OK? sends an SMS to community members X  mobile phones asking if they are okay. As soon as all the responses are r eceived, or after five minutes (whichever comes first), the syst em sends a status alert to group members and details about the emergency such as when, where, and what happened. For example, if everyone has responded that they are okay after an earthquake, the system will send an alert to everyone in the network,  X  X n earthquake occurred in [place] at [time]. [Names] have confirmed that they are safe. Would you like to keep receiving alerts about this incident? X  Users then have the option to say,  X  X ES X  if they would like to receive additional alerts about the incident or  X  X O X  if they would not. By alerting people of emergencies along with location-based information about their family and friends, awareness may rise without increasing fear. In the case where someone does not confirm their safety, users would receive a message that says that,  X  X n earthquake occurred in [place] at [time]. [Names] have confirmed that they are safe while [Names of the unconfirmed] have NOT confirmed that they are safe. Based on the location of that they have been affected by this incident. Reply No if you don X  X  want to receive more messages about this incident. X  Therefore, personalized information is received based on one X  X  self-defined network (see Figure 1 for details). R U OK? is currently being evaluated for its effectiveness at using group information to increase percepti ons of safety and sense of community during emergencies. This poster presents a novel me thod of designing an emergency alert system that provides user s with personal information. Though R U OK? aims to increase feelings of safety and sense of community at universities, design implications drawn from the evaluation of this system could be applied to technologies created for other types of communities (e.g., high crime neighborhoods, war-ridden countries, or areas that experience a natural disaster). The eventual goal of this research is to present best practices for designing emergency systems a nd other communication methods for family and friends to exchange information about their safety during emergency situations.
