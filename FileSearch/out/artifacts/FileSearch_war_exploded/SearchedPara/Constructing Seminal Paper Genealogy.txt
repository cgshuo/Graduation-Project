 When a researcher starts with a new topic, it would be very useful if seminal papers in the topic and their relationships are provided in advance. We propose an approach to construct seminal paper ge-nealogy and show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. H.4 [ Information Systems Applications ]: Miscellaneous Algorithms, Measurement, Design Seminal Paper Finding, Paper Genealogy Construction
When a researcher starts with a new topic, she or he faces the problem of literature survey for the topic. This requires her or him to spend a considerable amount of time for searching for high-quality and relevant papers from conferences, journals, or scholar search engines. For doing literature survey, it is also important to understand a research trend which gives us insight on the topic. If one grasps the research trend in the topic by thorough literature survey, she or he will predict the future research direction well, and thus will perform successful researches. However, during the liter-ature survey, it is extremely difficult to catch such a trend because the coverage of survey could be limited and/or the understanding of the topic could be insufficient.

Therefore, it is crucial to identify seminal papers in a research topic in question and the relationships among them. The construc-tion of seminal paper genealogy will reduce the efforts of literature survey greatly and will enable to easily catch the trend of the re-search domain. More specifically, in this paper, we address two problems: (1) finding the seminal papers and (2) constructing their genealogy automatically from a set of papers belonging to the same topic. We first suggest the four goals for seminal paper finding and propose a novel method that makes them satisfied (Section 2). Second, we identify two requirements of an influence measure for paper genealogy and examine the characteristics of candidates for being used as our influence measure and their applicability to our seminal paper genealogy (Section 3). Finally, we verify the effec-tiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach through extensive experiments (Section 4).
A seminal paper could be an old paper that is highly original and thus is cited by a lot of papers for a long time. On the other hand, it also could be a root of a recent trend and recognized as a rising star. The following is our list of goals in those finding seminal papers.
A seminality score of a paper is a score that measures the degree of how much the paper satisfies the four goals mentioned in Sec-tion 2.1. We have a citation graph, where nodes represent papers belonging to a given topic and edges do citations among them: i.e., if a paper p 1 cites another paper p 2 , a directed edge from p appears in the graph. By analyzing the graph, we get seminality scores of all the papers. Because we want interpretable results and thus prefer a probabilistic framework, our method is based on the Random Walk with Restart (RWR)[7].

RWR successfully determines the authority of a paper in the ci-tation graph. Therefore, this RWR-based computation for the sem-inality score makes Goal 1 of seminal paper finding satisfied.
Equation 1 shows the concept of RWR[7]. where W is an n  X  n row-normalized citation matrix, e is an n restart vector with e i =1 /n , c is a restart probability, and r is an n  X  1 seminality score vector.

In order to achieve Goal 2, we propose two solutions. First, we introduce a new notion of customized RWR (cRWR), which is a method of computing a seminality score for a single paper i .We change restart vector e ( i ) in cRWR to be sensitive to the similarity of other papers to paper i instead of uniform distribution that is employed in the original RWR. Namely, for paper i , we employ a customized e ( i ) in RWR-based computation. Here, where sim ( i, j ) is a similarity between paper i and paper j ,and Z (= topic ) is a normalization factor.

As a result, owing to customized e ( i ) , cRWR accumulates a more seminality score (i.e., more honored) for paper i when it is cited by relevant papers rather than by non-relevant papers.

Second, we change citation matrix W based on the similarity between citing and cited papers as follows: where CitedBy ( i ) is a set of all the papers cited by paper i . With this modification, when a paper distributes its score to its citing papers, it gives a larger score to a more relevant paper. Thus, paper i gets a high score when it receives citations from many relevant papers. As a result, the two solutions make Goal 2 satisfied.
To achieve Goal 3, we reflect the difference of publication years between two papers in restart vector e ( i ) . We adopt an exponential growth function to give some incentive to a pair of papers of a large difference in publication years. The modified restart vector is as follows: where yr ( i ) is the publication year of paper i ,and t is a scaling parameter that needs to be tuned to get a suitable value.
By using the exponential growth function, e ( i ) j becomes higher when the difference of publication years between papers i and j gets larger. Thus, paper i gets a high seminality score when it re-ceives many citations from the papers having long temporal-distance from it, which implies Goal 3 is satisfied.

Finally, to find young seminal papers (Goal 4), we modify restart vector e ( i ) in such a way that the restart probabilities of the papers published before paper i are set to 0 as in Equation 5. This makes all the papers take part in a fair competition regardless of their ages: (1) Old papers have a lot of following papers that are published after them and thus can cite them. Therefore, the customized restart vector e ( i ) of old paper i has a lot of small probability values. As a result, old paper i cannot get a high seminality score unless it is cited by most papers published after it. (2) Recent papers, on the other hand, have a few papers published after them and can get a high seminality score if they are cited by a few papers published after them relatively. Thus, a seminality score of paper i is greatly affected by the ratio of the papers that are able to cite paper i to the papers that actually cite paper i instead of the absolute number of papers that cite paper i . Therefore, Goal 4 can be satisfied. e e
A paper is influenced by some papers that have been previously published, which is represented in the form of its citations. How-ever, the degrees of influence of the cited papers on a citing paper are different[1]. In this paper, we model the influence relationship of two papers as a parent-child relationship : A parent paper p has a great influence on a child paper c .A genealogy is defined as a set of all parent-child relationships among seminal papers in a topic. We adopt the Markovian assumption which is employed in [1]. The authors are sure to cite the papers having a significant influence on their paper. Therefore, in finding the parent-child relationship, it is sufficient to consider those pairs of papers having a citation relationship only, rather than all the possible pairs of papers. The procedure of constructing genealogy is sketched as follows:
For every paper c , we do Step 1 through Step 3.
The influence score of a parent paper p to a child paper c indi-cates the degree of paper c is influenced by paper p . The influence score can be measured in diverse ways. However, to understand the influence between citing and cited papers, the influence mea-sure should satisfy the following requirements.
We decided to use text-based[2] or link-based[3][8][10] similar-ity as our candidate influence measure. The reasoning behind this decision is that if a child paper c was influenced by a parent paper p , then their texts and/or citations should be similar to each other to some degree.

Here, we discuss which of them is appropriate for being used as our influence score. The degree of influence between two pa-pers is well evaluated in all the similarity measures. If a paper c was influenced by another paper p , these two papers are meant to deal with the same issue. So, their texts have a number of com-mon terms. Similarly, they also have common citations. Therefore, Requirement 1 is satisfied with all the similarity measures.
In Requirement 2, text-based similarity measures do not take the temporal-distance between papers into account at all, and thus can-not satisfy Requirement 2. On the other hand, link-based similarity measures consider the temporal-distance. Because authors tend to cite recent quality papers in a topic, old and young papers have different sets of citations even though they deal with the same is-sue. The similarity between two papers becomes small in this case. Thus, link-based similarity measures satisfy Requirement 2.
For experiments, we used 1,071,973 papers in DBLP dataset[5] downloaded on March, 2009 and extracted their citation informa-tion from Libra 1 . We first found seminal papers and then con-structed their genealogy on three well-known topics of clustering, association rules, and graph mining. The ground truth for seminal papers was extracted from the reference section of each topic in a well-known data mining textbook[2].
We measured the Mean Average Precision (MAP) of three dif-ferent paper ranking methods, RWR[7], PopRank[6], and our Sem-inal Paper Finding (SPF). We conducted 3-fold cross validation for parameter tuning of previous ranking methods. As a result, the pa-rameter c was set to 0.5 for previous ranking methods which was shown to provide the best performance. The parameters for our SPF method were set to c = 0.5 and t = 2.6.

The results are shown in Table 1. Our proposed method performs better than any other methods. This is because SPF method per-forms much better in finding recent seminal papers (Table 2 clearly shows this result).

We also measured the recall at top 30 to evaluate the performance of each method in finding recent papers. Table 2 shows the results. Our SPF method finds both old and recent seminal papers very well and its recall is higher than those of any other methods. Although the recall of SPF in old papers is slightly lower than those of RWR, it boosts recall levels a lot in recent papers.

We did qualitative evaluation for our SPF method. We present only the result of the SPF method on a clustering topic due to the limited space. Table 3 shows the list of the top 20 seminal pa-pers sorted by the publication year. Our method found not only old seminal papers such as CLARANS (#1), DBSCAN (#3), and http://academic.research.microsoft.com/ BIRCH (#4), but also relatively recently-published papers such as Chameleon (#13), LOF (#16), and Data Streams (#19 and #20).
Due to the space limitations, we show only the genealogy on the clustering topic. First, we found 20 seminal papers, shown in Ta-ble 3, and then constructed genealogy using Inter-Connection[10], the state-of-the-art link-based similarity method for scientific lit-erature, with the most significant parent-child relationship only as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1(a) shows the genealogy using Inter-Connection, which satisfies all our requirements. The genealogy of the clustering topic originates from Paper #1 in our database. As time goes by, the topic was developed into several sub-topics such as density-based clustering (#3 and #11), hierarchical clustering (#4, #8, and #18), high dimensional clustering (#7 and #12), outlier detection (#9 and #16), and data stream clustering (#14, #20, #18, and #19).
Because Inter-Connection can reflect the temporal-distance, two papers could be in parent-child relationship when their publication years are close to each other. This contributes to producing a nice genealogy. Even when the temporal-distance between two papers is large, however, Inter-Connection could connect them by a parent-child relationship if they have a strong influence relationship. The connection between Papers #3 and #11 (both address density-based clustering) shows this example.

Figure 1(b) shows the genealogy using Cosine similarity[2]. Dif-ferent from the genealogy using Inter-Connection, the genealogy originated from two papers (#1 and #2). Because Cosine similarity does not consider the temporal-distance between two papers, it di-rectly connects Paper #11 to Paper #1 (the origin) instead of Paper #3 that has a great influence on Paper #11 and was published later than Paper #1.

In summary, Inter-Connection (link-based similarity method) per-forms better than Cosine similarity (text-based similarity method) in constructing seminal paper genealogy. On the other two topics, we performed the same experiments and obtained similar results.
Ranking Ranking is one of the most important issues in the sci-entific literature domain. Unlike the ranking algorithms for web pages such as PageRank[7] and HITS[4] that only use hyperlinks, ranking algorithms for academic and scientific literature try to use information such as authors and publication venues in addition to the citation information in order to measure the authority of a paper more accurately. Browsing-based model[9] and PopRank[6] utilize the author-paper relationships in ranking in addition to the citation relationships. Furthermore, PopRank considers additional publica-tion venue-paper relationships.

Similarity measure The similarity measures can be classified into two categories: (1) text-based measures that consider the terms contained in the title, abstract, keywords, and body of a paper as features of the paper in similarity computation[2], and (2) link-based measures that consider the papers commonly cited by or cit-ing a pair of papers in computing similarity of the two papers[3][8][10]
