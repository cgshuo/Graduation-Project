 Twitter is a popular open platform of soci al network service, where users can follow anyone they are interested in and share anything they want. At the same time, real-time information diffusion makes Twitter an inherent social media where users can easily obtain and freely talk about various kinds of information, such as breaking news, real world ev ents, interesting videos and so on.
Hashtags, starting with a # symbol, have been commonly used to identify topics on Twitter. In our dataset from Twitter, about 400,000 new hashtags are generated every day. However, onl y dozens of them can become bursting hashtags. There are two typical types of such hashtags. One type is breaking news or events happening in the real world, for example, #londonriots. The other type is memes, which motivates users to share their feelings following these topics, for example, #hashtagyourdreamschool. In this study, we concentrate on the real-time prediction of such bursting hashtags. Prediction of bursting hashtags are valuable to some practical applications, such as news or event discovery, information retrieval, microblog recommendation, public opinion analysis, etc. For example, it can be used to find rumors before they burst and spread widely. The contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. We provide the first definition of a bursting hashtag, and propose a solution 2. Experiments are conducted on real datasets from Twitter, and the results In [3], Gupta et al. used regression, classification and hybrid approaches to pre-dict future popularity of current popular events. Analogously, Ma et al. [4,5] predicted popularity of hashtags in daily granularity. Tsur et al. [7] studied the effect of content on the spread of hashtags in weekly granularity. Most germane to this work are the studies from the same group [6,1], which focused on detecting trending topics by time series classification. Our work, conversely, provides the first definition of bursting hashtags and aims to predict the bursting hashtags in real-time before they burst. c denotes the count of tweets containing the hashtag at the t -th time interval. Considering the real-time characteristic of Twitter, the granularity of the time interval is set to 1 minute in this study. Definitions of bursting hashtags are as follows: Definition 1. Prediction-Trigger. A clear majority of hashtags will never get burst, and a substantial number of bursting hashtags have a long dormant period before they burst. The average time before a hashtag gets burst is about 8.72 days since the hashtag first appears. Therefore we define a trigger to obtain a candidate set of hashtags to be predicted. For each hashtag, a five-minute sliding window is used to check the total count of tweets containing the hashtag within the consecutive five minutes, denoted as C slw .If C slw &gt; X  , the prediction is triggered.
 Definition 2. Burst. We define the burst of a hashtag by referencing to the definition of spikes in [2]. Within 24 hours since the prediction was triggered, if c is greater than max( c 1 +  X , 1 . 5 c 1 ), t is defined as the onset of burst. Such a hashtag is a bursting hashtag.

There are two parameters in these definitions.  X  , can be adjusted according to the statistics of real data and the requirement of practical applications. We have mentioned that in our dataset about 400,000 new hashtags can be identified every day.  X  is set to 50 in this paper, which makes the proportion of bursting hashtags about 0.6%%, i.e., about 25 bursting hashtags can be found each day. If a larger proportion is required, the value of  X  should be set smaller, and vice versa.  X  is set equal to  X  , which ensures that there are no bursting hashtags already burst before triggering prediction.

Based on the definitions above, the prediction task is defined as: among the hashtags triggering prediction, which ones will be bursting hashtags? This prob-lem can be framed to a normal binary classification task.

Input: A set of candidate hashtags which triggered prediction HT = { ht 1 ,ht 2 , ... } . Algorithm 1. Training the optimal classification model.

Output: A class label for each hashtag L ( h i ) ,h i  X  HT , indicating whether it will be a bursting one.

Solution: Since the dataset is unbala nced, we propose a weighted SVM-based method to solve this problem. An optimal weight for the positive class is needed to train the classification model. Algorithm 1 shows the process of optimizing the weight for the positive class. Since the dataset is unbalanced, F 1 -score is used as the criteria for training the optimal model. At the same time, we also tried several related methods to evaluate the performance. The evaluation results are demonstrated in Section 4. Experiments are conducted on the datasets collected through the Twitter stream API with Gardenhose access, containing roughly 10% of all public statuses on Twitter. We have collected three dataset s according to the requirements of the prediction problem, including a two-month historic set (2012.9-2012.10), a three-month training set (2012.11-2013.1) and a one-month test set (2013.3). We ex-tracted seven types of features which may indicate the future trend of hashtags, including meme features, user features, co ntent features, network features, hash-tag features, time series features, and prototype features. Table 1 shows the distribution of hashtags triggering prediction. Since the dataset is largely unbal-anced, F 1 -score is used as the performance metric.

Table 2 shows the performance comparison for the prediction of bursting hashtags. Predictions were made at six representative time, which can be divided into three stages, early stage (5min, 15min), middle stage (30min, 1h) and late stage (3h, 6h). It can be seen that, our method significantly outperforms the other related methods in terms of F 1 -score.
