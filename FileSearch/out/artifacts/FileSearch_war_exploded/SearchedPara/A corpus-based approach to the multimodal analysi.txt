 Juan Antonio Prieto Velasco Abstract Modern communication environments have changed the cognitive pat-terns of individuals, who are now used to the interaction of information encoded in different semiotic modalities, especially visual and linguistic. Despite this, the main premise of Corpus Linguistics is still ruling: our perception of and experience with the world is conveyed in texts, which nowadays need to be studied from a multi-modal perspective. Therefore, multimodal corpora are becoming extremely useful to extract specialized knowledge and explore the insights of specialized language and its relation to non-language-specific representations of knowledge. It is our assertion that the analysis of the image-text interface can help us understand the way visual and linguistic information converge in subject-field texts. In this article, we use Frame-based terminology to sketch a novel proposal to study images in a corpus rich in pictorial representations for their inclusion in a terminological resource on the environment. Our corpus-based approach provides the methodological under-pinnings to create meaning within terminographic entries, thus facilitating specialized knowledge transfer and acquisition through images.
 Keywords Frame-based terminology Knowledge visualization Multimodality Image-text interface Terminological resources 1 Introduction The new multimodal communication environments are changing the traditional notion of text, and recent trends in Linguistics now consider non-linguistic elements, particularly images, as indispensable for the representation and transfer of knowledge. This, in turn, has contributed to a change in the cognitive patterns of individuals. Therefore, Corpus Linguistics needs to go beyond the mere exploration of linguistic representations and aspires to become a real instrument to study the relationship between different representations of knowledge. As far as the design of terminological resources is concerned, if a sign is made up of meaning ( X  X ignified X ) and form ( X  X ignifiers X ) such as colour, perspective, size, proportions, etc., it becomes evident that such resources should account for semiotic modalities other than language, in interaction with each other and with language.
 In fact, Knowledge Visualization (Jewitt 2009 ; Unsworth 2008 ; Kress and Van Leeuwen 2002a , b ) and multimodal approaches to text analysis (O X  X alloran and Smith, forthcoming; O X  X alloran et al. 2010 ) have recently placed an especial emphasis on the study of the interaction of multiple semiotic modalities. For specialized lexicographers, in particular, the exploration of the image-text interface emerges as an important challenge concerning the construction of specialized knowledge resources.

According to Faber ( 2011 ), knowledge-based terminological resources should reflect, to the extent possible, the processes that actually occur in the brain, so terminologists should take note of recent advances in cognition, and make an effort to model specialized knowledge representations accordingly. In line with this, the design of useful terminological resources needs to be based on knowledge extracted from texts which reflect real usage of terms and images. Recent theories of cognition point at the fact that our understanding of the world is both embodied and linguistic: on the one hand, knowledge is grounded in situated action, simulations and bodily states which evidence the way we experience the world (Barsalou 2008 ); on the other hand, there is evidence that language does encode embodied relations (Louwerse and Jeuniaux 2010 ). Consequently, we think that such an embodiment has an influence in the way we represent knowledge in texts; that is to say, texts, in their widest sense, contain information pertaining to more than one sensory modality or semiotic mode of communication. Corpus Linguistics can help us grasp meaningful information about how we perceive, store and retrieve concepts in order to provide coherent terminological resources. In other words, the basic reason for collecting multimodal corpora is that they provide material for more complete studies of interactive sharing and construction of meaning and understanding (Allwood 2008 : 210). It is important to remark on the fact that there are several degrees of multimodality. As a consequence, multimodal corpora range from those containing just text and images to those which are rich in visual representations, recordings of gestures, postures, gaze, emotional states, etc. such as the AMI corpus and other cooperative multimodal communication corpora.

Multimodal Corpus Linguistics has so far been a theoretical rather than an applicative discipline (Baldry and Thibault 2006 , 2008 ), that is the reason why we attempt to bring together both perspectives. In this article, we sketch a novel methodological proposal to the multimodal analysis and extraction of specialized knowledge by exploring images in a textual corpus rich in visual resources with a view to including pictorial representations in a terminological resource on the environment. In this regard, our corpus is not a multimodal corpus as such, despite it has been compiled, processed and analysed from a multimodal perspective. The scope of the work described is therefore to extract knowledge from a corpus which contains both texts and images. The question is how a corpus-based approach can be applied to and incorporated in the visual representation of specialized knowledge concepts. 2 Theoretical and methodological underpinnings The study of specialized language has evolved from purely linguistic premises to more complicated arguments defending the cognitive basis of specialized knowl-edge representation. As Faber ( 2009 , 2011 ) points out, Terminology has integrated some principles from Cognitive Linguistics and Psychology in order to explain how concepts are stored in and retrieved from our mental lexicon. Indeed, Sociocognitive Terminology (Temmerman 2000 ) and Termontography (Temmerman and Kerre-mans 2003 ) have gone a step further in the description of the conceptual structures underlying the specific meaning of terms. So does Frame-based terminology (Faber et al. 2005 , 2006 , 2007 ).

The research we are presenting is founded on a recent theory of specialized language, known as Frame -based Terminology ( FBT ), a cognitive theory which approaches Terminology from a multimodal point of view. It borrows some ideas from cognitive scientists like Paivio X  X  dual coding ( 1971 ) and Baddeley X  X  cognitive load ( 1986 ), according to whom both visual and verbal codes for representing information are used to turn information in the working memory into knowledge that can be acted upon, stored, and retrieved for subsequent use.

This cognitive theory is frame-based insofar as it is grounded in the cognitive principles of perception, experience and understanding described by Fillmore ( 1982 , 1985 ). It includes a methodological corpus-based approach to the study of terms known as Process -oriented Terminology Management ; it is called process-oriented because it defends that individuals categorize concepts on the basis of the role they play in a given process. FBT shares the main premises of Corpus Linguistics, for terms are units of specialized meaning and behave the same way words do. Thus, FBT can be considered as a new paradigm for the multimodal description of specialized domains or subject fields, their terms, concepts and interrelations by extracting mainly semantic information from textual corpora, which are rich in pictorial representations. Sects. 2.1 and 2.2 provide a detailed description of both theoretical and methodological approaches. 2.1 Frame-based terminology Frame-based terminology assumes that cognitive operations such as concept representation (both internally and externally) play a key role in knowledge acquisition in specialized domains (Faber 2011 ; Faber et al. 2007 ; Prieto Velasco 2009 ). The scope of FBT is to serve as a principled framework for the design and specification of the conceptual organization of specialized domains through domain-specific representations. Faber ( 2009 ) states the theoretical premises of FBT as follows:  X  The general function of specialized language texts is the transmission of  X  Terms are words, and their behaviour can be described through the extraction of  X  The underlying category structure of specialized domains may be represented, in  X  Specialized knowledge acquisition is encouraged by multimodal representations In other words, FBT assumes, as Frame Semantics (Fillmore 1982 , Fillmore and Atkins 1992 ) does, that to truly understand the meaning of words, we must first understand how concepts are organized and the relationships that lie behind the usage of specialized meaning units. In this regard, it remains clear that any attempt to build a terminological database must reflect the way we perceive the world, which in turn is implicit in texts. FBT attempts to create non-language-specific representations which convey the conceptual meaning underlying texts. However, in order to abstract conceptual meaning it is essential to analyse linguistic, paralinguistic and extralinguistic information provided by texts. This is where Process-oriented Terminology Management and Corpus Linguistics meet: when a term is studied in its linguistic context, information about its meaning and its use can be extracted (Meyer and Mackintosh 1996 ). 2.2 Process-oriented terminology management Frame-based terminology is an integrated theory describing specialized language which also includes a methodological approach known as Process -oriented Terminology Management. Such a methodology has been applied to a couple of research projects, MarcoCosta and EcoSistema. 1 Currently, we are trying to identify the cognitive and communicative motivations for terminological variation in the project VariMed, 2 in which we are studying the causes for different designations of a single concept in the field of Medicine.

This methodology advocates a knowledge-based description of specialized domains to determine how concepts interact within a coherent category structure by means of semantic relations. Since our knowledge of the world is reflected in texts through information encoded in different semiotic modalities, the systematic analysis of specialized corpora appears as an extremely useful tool.

To provide an answer to the question about how corpora can be applied to and incorporated in the multimodal representation of specialized knowledge, FBT proposes to analyse multimodality in specialized texts, that is, observing the different types of information implied by different types of semiotic modalities, particularly linguistic and visual. The main objective is to obtain plenty of relevant information from textual corpora in order to be able to facilitate specialized knowledge acquisition.

Our methodology is regarded as process-oriented because it aims at describing specialized domains through the events that generally take place in them. Besides, it is multimodal because it extracts information from different knowledge represen-tations in corpora, particularly pictures. Accordingly, it is our assertion that the knowledge encoded in texts (definitions, contexts, concordances) should mesh with the visual information in images in order to provide a deeper understanding of dynamic domains.

In Bowker X  X  ( 2002 : 9) words,  X  X  X  corpus can be described as a large collection of authentic texts that have been gathered in electronic format according to a set of specific criteria X  X . To be more precise, a multimodal digitized corpus is a computer-based collection of language and communication -related material drawing on more than one sensory (perceptual) modality or on more than one production (semiotic) modality (Allwood 2008 : 207).

We focus on images because they, alongside words and terms, evoke perceptual details of processes and entities. Notwithstanding the importance of the depiction of concepts, most existing multimodal corpora rely on textual information, since present technology mostly does not really allow efficient search using the visual elements themselves.

Finally, the compilation of a corpus with a view to a meaningful analysis of images involves the annotation of many possible communication modalities such as the conceptual information contained in definitions, the linguistic information in texts, contexts and concordances, and the paralinguistic information in images. 2.3 From corpora to knowledge bases According to Lo  X  pez Rodr X   X  guez ( 2009 :345) the combination of knowledge-based descriptive Terminology and Corpus Linguistics provides an ideal methodology to extract specialized knowledge semi-automatically and to be able to manage and apply it to terminological resources. Building a consistent terminological resource with knowledge extracted from corpora is a complex and long process involving a series of steps which shall lead to the integration of visual data in terminological entries (Prieto Velasco and Lo  X  pez Rodr X   X  guez 2009 ), such as the one in Fig. 1 for the
FBT argues for the delimitation of a specialized domain in order to restrict the number of pertinent concepts belonging to a given subject field. The EcoLexicon terminological knowledge base includes more than 3,200 concepts and 14,000 terms in Spanish, English, German, Russian and Modern Greek, which have been identified in a multilingual corpus of environmental texts thanks to frequency lists. We have extracted mainly semantic and syntactic information by means of concordances and contexts, so as to recognize significant relations among concepts, which would lead to the representation of a general conceptual frame/template of reference, as shown in Fig. 2 .

Once we have an inventory of concepts and the relations linking one another, we are able to complete the data categories (ISO 12620) in terminological entries, integrate them within the corresponding template (agent, process, patient/result), design definitional schemas reflecting the category structure, and write coherent informative definitions. We can also include basic grammatical information about terms and exemplify their usage through contexts, concordances, and multimodal resources like images. In the following section, we will exemplify the methodology described in Sect. 2.2 . 3 Exploring specialized knowledge representations through corpus techniques in EcoLexicon EcoLexicon ( http://ecolexicon.ugr.es ) is a multilingual knowledge base on envi-ronment enhanced by both linguistic and paralinguistic representations and integrated in an ontological model. It targets different user groups, such as trans-lators, technical writers, environmental experts, etc., who wish to expand their knowledge about the environment for the purpose of text comprehension or gen-eration. The main objective of EcoLexicon is user knowledge acquisition thanks to a visual interface with different modules for conceptual, linguistic, and graphical data, which account for the way we understand and perceive the world.

In fact, a validation study has been conducted among two user groups, translators and engineers (Lo  X  pez Rodr X   X  guez et al. 2012 ), in order to assess (a) the usefulness of EcoLexicon in the acquisition of expert knowledge; (b) the usefulness of EcoLexicon in translation; (c) the usability of the interface. Results showed that visual information and definitions were highlighted as being the most handy tools for translators by 20 %, although some of them suggested that the selection of visual resources should target specific user profiles of the knowledge base. Despite this, almost 82 % of users considered that the visual resources of EcoLexicon are useful.
However, one question arises: why do we place our emphasis on the visual component of textual corpora? Many theories about cognitive load during conceptual processing and modelling (Baddeley 1986 ) suggest that multimodal representations help in the construction of the mental image of the domain, and thus decrease the load on the working memory in the process of knowledge acquisition (Prieto Velasco 2008 ). Thus, visual materials should be analyzed and selected according to the cognitive architecture of users. In short, the vast majority of corpora are now compiled with multimodality in mind, since images and text coexist and work together in the representation of knowledge; moreover, exploring the semantic relations between image X  X ext pairs in multimodal corpora is a challenge to most linguists due to present constraints of corpus software. 3.1 Corpus compilation The general corpus compiled for EcoLexicon contains about 5 million words and consists of specialized texts (e.g., scientific journal articles, PhD theses, etc.), semispecialized texts (textbooks, handbooks, manuals, etc.), and texts for the general public, all of them belonging to the multidisciplinary domain of environmental science.

However, for our specific work on knowledge visualization, we compiled a smaller textual corpus from which images were extracted as separate files in order to create an independent visual corpus. The visual corpus consists of nearly 2,000 images extracted from electronic texts. Actually, the visual corpus is just the graphic component of our textual corpus of more than one million words reuniting texts with different degrees of specialization and aimed at heterogeneous recipients. The corpus is divided into three subcorpora containing popular science texts for a lay audience, semi-specialized texts, and highly specialized texts addressed to experts.
If we were to classify our special purpose corpus we could say that it is a closed, synchronic, English monolingual, machine readable, written corpus. For its compilation, we took into account several aspects: web availability, written in the English language, belonging to the environmental subject field, extracted from reliable sources, high relevance, varied textual genres and visual content. 3.2 Corpus annotation Annotation enriches a corpus by adding various types of linguistic information. An annotated corpus may be considered as a repository of knowledge, because the information which was implicit in the plain text has been made explicit through concrete annotations (McEnery and Wilson 2001 : 32).

It is only through annotation that we will be able to retrieve meaningful information from texts. The novelty of our proposal resides in the fact that there is neither an agreed annotation practice for paralinguistic information nor a consensus on the way of representing multimodal knowledge in textual corpora. When we extracted images from the texts they belonged to, they were named and numbered after the name of the original file for the sake of classification. For the purpose of annotation, we followed the following steps:  X  Finding the original location of images in texts.  X  Analysing keywords in the surrounding context.  X  Checking definitions in EcoLexicon.  X  Matching visual components and conceptual characteristics.  X  Finding a suitable conceptual tag.  X  Analysing the pictorial configuration of the image in terms of iconicity,  X  Classifying images according to our typology.  X  Adding a tag for visual components.

Finally, we used a repertory of tags allusive to the specialized concept depicted and the cognitive and semiotic patterns of images themselves, as described in Sects. 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 . 3.2.1 Conceptual tags Concept tagging helps us make explicit the semantic content of images by means of tags referring to the concept represented graphically, so as to find different types of concepts and images. Conceptual tags were added manually by only one coder to guarantee maximum coherence using relevant information from titles, captions, alt attribute, longdesc attribute, and embedded text. WordSmith Tools does not allow to annotate texts automatically. The coder had experience in annotating corpora for terminological purposes in a series of projects aimed at extracting specialized knowledge and representing it accordingly in terminological databases. A similar tagging procedure was carried out in a previous pilot study, which proved the validity of our methodology to explore images in corpora. We also used the definitions which had been already entered into EcoLexicon to match the most salient attributes and properties of concepts with those depicted in the image. We used Google Picasa to extract and organize images from texts. Thanks to the different textual descriptions accompanying images, we could generate ad hoc tags EROSION &gt;. Finally, we inserted tags in the same place where images should appear in a txt file, as shown in Fig. 3 .

Figure 3 contains the conceptual tag for an image in a text about surface ocean currents. By looking at the caption and identifying keywords such as atmosphere and circulate , we knew that the pictorial representation referred to ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION . Then, we checked its definition in EcoLexicon: system of air movements above the Earth surface and decided that the most appropriate tag was &lt; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION &gt;, since the image represents movement through a set of arrows contiguous to the Earth X  X  surface in the form of a system. 3.2.2 Tags for visual components Along with conceptual tags, we need to analyse the characteristics of images in subject-field texts if we want to find any significant connection with the types of concepts they often represent. Diverse functional classifications of image X  X ext pairs (Carney and Levin 2002 ; Marsh and White 2003 ; Martinec and Salway 2005 , Liu and O X  X alloran 2009 ) are useful provided that they account for the different ways images convey meaning. However, they seem to coincide in certain descriptive patterns: iconicity, abstraction, and dynamism (Prieto Velasco 2008 ). As we said above, our corpus comprises those criteria as ways of referring to and depicting specific attributes of specialized concepts. These tags are then necessary to explore what types of images usually co-occur in texts with different degrees of specialization.

Iconicity refers to the degree of resemblance between an image and its referent depending on the number of perceptual features they both have in common. Abstraction makes reference to the cognitive effort demanded to users with different levels of knowledge on the subject field in order to identify the concept depicted and understand the image X  X  semantic content. Dynamism refers to the capacity of an image to represent movement either explicitly or implicitly.

The combination of those criteria results in certain cognitive and semiotic patterns which describe eight types of images, as shown in Table 1 .

Tags consist of four elements which will eventually make easier the exploration of the relationship image X  X ext in our corpus: an ID of the type of image according to the previous classification (1), (e. g. IMGA); an explicitation of whether images are iconic or not (2), are abstract or not (3), are dynamic or not (4).

Type A, for instance, can be described as an iconic (ico), abstract (ab), dynamic (din) image. It is indispensable to split tags into as many characteristics as we want to study, because it is the only way to provide well-planned search equations in a corpus analysis tool like WordSmith Tools. Our corpus is analysed with the applications WordList, Concord, KeyWords and Viewer to look at the most frequently used images in scientific X  X echnical texts on the environment and whether the type of image is determined just by the text, by the concept depicted, or a combination of both. 3.3 Corpus processing: methodology In this section, we go through the subsequent steps which are needed for the completion of a coherent terminological entry in EcoLexicon: (1) elaboration of frequency lists; (2) extraction of conceptual information from concordances and contexts to elaborate a terminographic definition on the basis of most significant semantic relations; (3) elaboration of a conceptual and visual template; (4) inclusion of images in terminographic entries. As an example, we present how the WAVE entry has been elaborated and completed. 3.3.1 Elaboration of frequency wordlists Initially, we must concretize the most pertinent concepts within the subject field, for those would be the most suitable candidates to have their own terminological entry within EcoLexicon. To do so, we need to generate lemmatized wordlists (using the WordList application in WordSmith Tools) to obtain the absolute and relative frequency of terms. Moreover, if wordlists are lemmatized by joining morphological variants of the same lexeme and linking those to synonymic lemmas, it is possible to observe the most active conceptual features in our corpus (Lo  X  pez Rodr X   X  guez 2001 ). Table 2 shows a comparison among the 15 most frequent lemmas by level of specialization: We must remark the prevalent position of the lexeme wave .
Although the most frequent lexeme in two of our subcorpora is water , this could be rather ambiguous, since its specialized meaning does not differ much from its general meaning. Although finding a concise, concrete definition for water may seem a simple task, it is much more difficult, as it can be defined from a multidimensional perspective by showing different facets of the concept depending on the point of view:
Definition: water is the liquid that descends from the clouds as rain, forms streams, lakes, and seas, and is a major constituent of all living matter and that when pure is an odourless, tasteless, very slightly compressible liquid oxide of hydrogen H2O which appears bluish in thick layers, freezes at 0 C and boils at 100 C, has a maximum density at 4 C and a high specific heat, is feebly ionized to hydrogen and hydroxyl ions, and is a poor conductor of electricity and a good solvent. (Merriam-Webster).

This general definition, however, is based on more concrete smaller definitions coming from several subject-fields:  X  liquid that descends from the clouds as rain, forms streams, lakes, and seas.  X  a major constituent of all living matter. (Biology).  X  odourless, tasteless, very slightly compressible liquid oxide of hydrogen H 2 O.  X  compressible liquid which appears bluish in thick layers, freezes at 0 C and
Then, it is not strange that a rather general term like water is the 6th most common in highly specialized texts devoted to the study of waves, whereas it is the most common in less specialized texts in which waves are described in broader terms. Unarguably, there is a close relationship between both concepts, because WATER is the liquid medium through which WAVES travel, and both concepts necessarily co-occur in any text, regardless its specificity.

Definitions for wave , in turn, do present variable degrees of specificity, for example:
Collins Cobuild English Dictionary (CCED): a wave is a raised mass of water on the surface of water, especially the sea, which is caused by the wind or by tides making the surface of the water rise and fall.
 movement of water on or near the surface of standing water in which a succession of crests and troughs advance while particles of water follow cyclic paths without advancing.
 The relationship between WATER and WAVE is rather curious. We might think that water is the material of which waves are made, but in Coastal Engineering, Physics and Oceanography, waves are categorized as processes and not entities. The conceptual relation MADE-OF (a kind of meronymy) is used to link an object and its material, but this relation becomes PHASE-OF (generation, development, propagation, dissipation, shoaling) in the case of concepts with a procedural nature. The actual conceptual relation linking WATER and WAVE is TAKES-PLACE-IN, since waves occur in water (Leo  X  n Arau  X  z and Faber 2010 ). For the sake of clarity, we will use the concept WAVE to exemplify our methodology. Indeed, we assume that most concepts in our frequency wordlist, including WATER , can somehow be associated with WAVE through the conceptual categories shown in Table 3 .
Further on, we will try to learn how these concepts are interrelated and which semantic relations are activated among them thanks to concordances. 3.3.2 Generation of concordance lines Concordances have normally been used to disambiguate meaning or study collocates. We generate concordances (using the Concord application) to extract specialized knowledge and examine salient semantic relations by observing syntactic patterns, so that we can learn which concepts are linked to which and the location of a given concept within the whole category structure of the domain, in the case of EcoLexicon, the environmental event (see Fig. 2 ). We also need concordances to search for images and explore (1) the image X  X ext interface, (2) the configuration (visual syntax) images adopt to depict a given concept, and (3) to what extent a given image is representative of the semantic relations implied by the concept depicted.

Table 4 shows a meaningful selection of concordances allusive to the semantic relations activated in the search of the term wave (wave* also retrieves concordances for waves ).

Those semantic relations are essential to reach a consistent definitional schema, as shown in Table 5 , and to propose a corpus-based terminographic definition, which bears great resemblance with the definition provided by the International Erosion Control Association.

Concordances can also contribute to study the status of images, because they can tell us to what extent images succeed in the depiction of semantic relations; to put it simpler, if images are text-dependent or just complementary, or if images are subordinated to texts or vice versa.

Table 6 contains concordances for images which represent concepts related to wave . By linking conceptual tags and visual tags and retrieving them together, we are able to analyze if the descriptive criteria of images contribute to depict the semantic relations we have previously identified. If we pay attention to those criteria, we can conclude that most images are iconic, since they represent a perceivable phenomenon with real existence in our surrounding world, a wave. represented iconically, because they are physical and mathematical magnitudes with no real existence. For this reason, these magnitudes are difficult to understand for most people and the semantic content of images requires an effort to be deciphered, so they are considered to be abstract images. With regard to dynamism, most images are static in nature (pictures, drawings, photographs, etc.), but adopt a dynamic configuration when it comes to represent procedural concepts such as WAVE
In line with this, we can also search for those images which are more likely to co-occur in texts with different degrees of specialization. EcoLexicon targets a heterogeneous audience (experts, technical writers, scientific journalists, students, lexicographers, translators, etc.), that is why our corpus contains highly specialized texts, semispecialized texts and texts for the general public. The same way we can choose to define a concept differently depending on whether we are addressing an expert or not, images vary on the basis of the degree of specialization of the text they belong to (Prieto Velasco 2008 , 2009 ). Terminological variation is not an exclusively linguistic phenomenon to explain that there are words more specialized than others; there is commonly a cognitive or communicative motivation by which individuals are more prone to use one representation to the detriment of the others (Tercedor 2011 ; Freixa 2006 ; Bowker and Howkins 2006 ).

The concordances in Table 7 show that Types C and H are the most prevalent in our corpus and that they normally represent concepts differently by showing different degrees of iconicity, abstraction and dynamism, as seen in the corresponding tags. This is somehow associated with terminological variation, since both types of images can be used to refer to different instances of the same concept, which can be distinguished on a communicative basis, as shown in Images A and B in Fig. 4 .

Image A in Fig. 4 is a non-iconic, abstract, dynamic image (Type E) used to depict the two-week cycle of spring and neap tides, whereas Image B, iconic, non-abstract, dynamic (Type G), is used to depict the same concept using a different visual syntax. This is due to the fact that they address rather different audiences. They are both dynamic because they represent a process. Nevertheless, for the sake of efficient communication and transfer of knowledge, the way Images A and B represent information has very much to do with the communicative motivation underlying this kind of variation: the amount of prior subject-field knowledge shared by the recipients. Image A would be suitable when aimed at experts; Image B would only be useful for lay people who might not understand what a diagram such as the one shown in Image A refers to. In this respect, Images A and B can be considered visual instances of the same specialized concept and thus, terminological variants.
According to the prevalence shown in Table 7 , Type H is used to classify abstract images which have neither iconic nor dynamic aspects. In fact, they normally appear in highly specialized texts: 29.70 % of the 2,532 images in the whole corpus are Type H, and half of them appear in specialized texts, since they usually depict complex concepts that only experts can easily understand ( STEEP WAVE STATISTIC ; likely to represent simpler concepts iconically, with no need for a high abstraction level. From a contextual point of view, they appear in texts for the general public in FEATURES ; RIP CURRENT ). In our corpus, 35.70 % of images are Type C, and half of them occur in general texts. Pragmatically, we can assert that texts for the general public contain much more images (46 %) than highly specialized texts (20 %). 3.3.3 Knowledge-rich visual contexts (KRVCs) EcoLexicon entries also include contextual information to study the real use of terms. Linguistic contexts are extended concordances insofar as contexts can be obtained by increasing the span (number of words shown to the right and left of the search term) of concordances. They are helpful to concretize and disambiguate the semantic content of images which are not helpful enough to make meaning clear by themselves. As a result, they need to be incorporated in an integrated manner. According to Reimerink et al. ( 2010 :1934), contexts contribute to enhance multimodality in the image-text interface because: (i) They provide complementary information that enhances the definition of the term-entry; (ii) they help to delimit the information in the entry, and avoid interpretation errors by explicitly comparing and contrasting LUs; (iii) they (A) construct a more detailed mental model by visually relating all of the LUs in a domain-specific frame and event.
 As we have seen, for terminological resources to offer multimodal information, they should also contain knowledge-rich visual contexts (KRVCs). According to this notion introduced by Reimerink et al. ( 2010 ), such contexts help in the construction of the mental image of the domain, and thus decrease the load on the working memory in the process of knowledge acquisition (Prieto Velasco 2008 ). Then, both contexts and visual material should be analyzed and selected on the basis of the amount of information they convey. One way to integrate contexts and images under the same term entry would be looking for the verbs which often accompany a term in order to generate knowledge-rich multimodal contexts:  X  Identifying noun ? verb collocates.  X  Classifying verbs semantically (actions, processes, states, etc.).  X  Describing predicate-argument structures.  X  Finding pictorial representations for predicate-argument structures.  X  Combining knowledge-rich linguistic and visual contexts.  X  Designing a visual template to depict specialized concepts.

Firth X  X  quote  X  X  X ou will know a word by the company it keeps X  X  (Firth 1957 ) invites us to look at the co-text of terms to examine how they behave pragmatically and semantically. In fact, contexts can offer information about the verbs a term usually collocates with (see Table 8 ), which is useful to specify predicate-argument structures, where wave plays the role of an argument and the verb heading the predicate is usually an intransitive verb of motion:
The verbs for which the argument wave is an agent imply movement and reveal that the concept WAVE is categorized as a dynamic process. In line with Paivio ( 1971 ), to fully understand complex dynamic concepts, we need to create separate representations for incoming information processed in different channels: verbal and visual. For the purpose of making contexts meaningful pieces of information, we need to provide alternative semiotic modes for contextual information: knowledge-rich linguistic and visual contexts, shown in Table 9 .

The meaningful combination of both knowledge-rich linguistic and visual contexts is the last step prior the design of a visual template to graphically represent specialized concepts. As shown in Table 10 , linguistic contexts can be supported and complemented by visual contexts in the form of knowledge-rich multimodal contexts, which offer relevant terminological provided they depict the most salient conceptual relations: IS_A, TAKES_PLACE_IN, RESULT_OF, CAUSES, AFFECTED_BY, etc.
 3.3.4 Elaboration of a conceptual and visual template If we look back at the environmental event (Fig. 1 ) and observe the organization of concepts around WAVE and its definitional schema (Tables 3 and 5 ), we realize that both conceptual templates and semantic relations are inherited by concepts belonging to more restricted subject fields within the domain. This implies that main configuration of the environmental domain. Figure 5 shows the conceptual organization of wave -related concepts, whereas Table 11 illustrates the internal arrangement of the semantic relations for WAVE depicted by images with an auxiliary role. Consequently, they would be excellent candidates to be included under the terminographical entry of WAVE .
 Image A is useful for the representation of semantic relations like IS _ A or HAS _ LOCATION , because its iconic and dynamic appearance allows users to visualize what type of motion takes place during a wave on the sea surface. In addition, Image B activates the relation RESULT _ OF (also called HAS _ AGENT ) wind action, something users without prior knowledge can easily grasp, thanks to its low degree of abstraction. Image C represents changes in wave direction due to water depth, thus activating the relation AFFECTED _ BY . Finally, to provide a thorough depiction of the concept we need a pictorial representation ( Image D ) of the relation DESCRIPTION _ OF , which refers to defining attributes (length, height, frequency and period).
As we have seen, the analysis of multimodal representations of specialized knowledge and the extraction of meaningful information from corpora results in a coherent terminological resource containing consistent terminographic entries, as indicated in Fig. 1 at the beginning. 4 Conclusions and further research Frame-based terminology assumes the cognitive turn in descriptive terminology theories and accounts for a situated embodied approach to knowledge representa-tion, transfer and acquisition. It incorporates Corpus Linguistics methods to analyse multimodal corpora where we can extract meaningful information about the way we understand the world and represent concepts for the sake of effective specialized communication.

Terminological resources cannot conform to be mere repositories of grammatical information and should be conceived and designed to contain multimodal information from corpora, since texts are the natural habitat for terms and other knowledge representations, either linguistic or paralinguistic.

The multimodal convergence of images, the conceptual information in definitions and the linguistic information in contexts and concordances to create meaning stands now as conditio sine qua non in the design of terminological resources, because it highlights the most salient characteristics of concepts and promotes specialized knowledge acquisition.

Despite the advances in Corpus Linguistics technologies, which already allow to search texts in formats different from plain text, there remain some constraints with regard to the study of non-linguistic textual elements such as images and the annotation of multimodal corpora.

It is our opinion that the methodology we present is useful to overcome those current difficulties and to explore the relationship among different types of information, so that they can be included under the terminographic entry for a concept. We offer a principled way to select images, which cannot be chosen arbitrarily from the web and then uploaded to the vanishing cloud of online terminological resources.

In this paper, we have attempted to prove the validity of our methodology applied to EcoLexicon and describe the successive steps of our corpus analysis, which supports the appropriateness of certain types of images to depict concepts. We have also proposed a criterion-referenced classification of images which explains, from a pragmatic perspective, the semiotic and cognitive configuration images adopt to represent concepts and address the recipient audience.

However, there are still some issues which should be dealt with in corpus studies, like the cognitive or communicative motivations of terminological variation; how the mental images we have created for concepts can influence the selection of one terminological variant instead of another; and how different images can convey meaning for a single concept in an attempt to explain the phenomenon of visual variation.
