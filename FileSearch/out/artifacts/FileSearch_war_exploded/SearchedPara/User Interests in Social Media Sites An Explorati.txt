 Recent technological advances in mobile-based access to social networking platforms and facilities to update infor-mation in real X  X ime (e.g. in Facebook) have allowed an individual X  X  online presence to be as ephemeral and dynamic in nature, as her very thoughts and interests. In this context, micro-blogging has been widely adopted by users as an effective means to capture and disseminate their thoughts and actions to a larger audience on a daily basis. Interestingly, daily chatters of a user obtained from her micro X  X logs offer a unique information source to analyze and interpret her context in real-time  X  i.e. interests, intentions, and activities. In this paper, we gather data from the public timeline of Twitter spanning across ten worldwide cities over a period of four weeks. We use this dataset to (a) explore how users express interests in real X  X ime through micro X  X logs, and (b) understand how text mining techniques can be applied to interpret real-time context of a user based on her tweets . Initial findings reported herein suggest that social media sites like Twitter constitute a promising source forextractingusercontextthatcanbeexploitedbynovel social networking applications.

Social media is part of a growing trend in the web, where a majority of the new content being added is user generated. Social media includes a variety of sources where people share their thoughts (e.g. Twitter), multimedia (e.g. YouTube), and even their personal information (e.g. Facebook). Social networking sites allow people to not only mimic their real life networks online, but cross geo-spatial and social boundaries to create networks that would not be otherwise possible. New  X  X eal-time X  or  X  X eo X  social networking applications such as Ning[1], Plazes[2] and recently R X  X  X  X n? [7] allow social interactions that are a function of the users spatio-temporal context. For instance, R-U-In? allows users to connect with others in their social network who are geographically close, and available for some activity of mutual interest (e.g. which of my friends are interested in watching the new Star Trek movie this evening in the theater downtown? ). Whenever the context is limited to spatio-temporal elements, these are (relatively) easily and precisely obtained (e.g. assisted GPS type devices or E911 type systems). However, some elements of context involve personal preferences and plans of the requester and those of others in his/her social networks.
In this context, we focus on the hugely popular micro X  blogging platform called Twitter [3]. In doing so, we wish to study how the tweets of an individual provide a window into their own perspective of what they are thinking and doing. The ability to infer interests from text however has been done before  X  e.g. from analysing the users web page, or even their blogs [6, 10]. What makes the problem challenging and different is that tweets tend to be stream of consciousness fragments and lack the structure of a cogent argument or description. Moreover, even more so than blogs, tweets are directed at friends and family who share a common frame of reference. Many things can therefore be said or implied without being explicitly spelled out  X  including place names and times. In this paper, we report initial results of our analysis of these tweets using unstructured text mining techniques. We show that these tweets let Table 1: Top 20 words (based on frequency of use) us infer not only the interests of the user, but also allow contextual insights into their planned activities/interests. The results presented herein are a first-of X  X -kind, in terms of uncovering contextual information through micro X  X logs analysis, and an important step in enabling truly ubiquitous social networking.
Twitter is a social networking service that enables friends, family and colleagues to stay connected through sending and receiving updates, i.e., tweets . A tweet is a post of 140 characters or less, and conveys a user X  X  current thoughts, intentions, etc. The person making the post is called a tweeter, and others who have subscribed to the posts of the user are followers. According to a survey, 90% of tweeters keep their profiles and tweets public, thereby exposing a vast amount of data over the Internet.

Recently, Twitter developed a search engine that allows one to issue search queries over the last month X  X  tweets. Twitter exposes the search interface in ATOM and JSON formats, that lets a third party application to integrate the search functionality. We use the ATOM-based API to collect tweets over a period of four weeks between March X  X pril 2009. In order to make these tweets suitable for processing, every tweet was dumped as a triple: &lt; user name, tweet, time of publishing the tweet &gt; . Finally, we selected the most active users (i.e. those who tweeted at least once in a week) spanning across ten cities in the world. These cities amount for the top Twitter activity in terms of number of users [5], and the users contribute to 80% of the population of active Twitter users worldwide [4]. [8] gives a breakdown of the user population in these cities. Note that, approximately 21 million tweets have been used for our analysis.
We are interested in tweets that capture a user X  X  real-time interests in activities. Such tweets can be usually character-ized to have one or more of the following properties:-(i) ephemeral: i.e. the interest in an activity changes over time as opposed to being static (e.g. hobbies), (ii) descriptive: the interest can be described using one or more indicative keywords or terms, and (iii) localized: i.e. the interest (or activity) is usually associated with (contextual) location information. Our broad objective is to analyze tweets and identify interests (in activities) characterized along these dimensions. To do so, we need to identify tweets expressing interests with the help of certain content-indicative and usage-indicative keywords present as part of the description. Table 2: Category and indicative keywords describ-ing real-time interests Content-indicative keywords (or category words) express the broad class of user interest, e.g. movie, sports, etc. Usage-indicative keywords characterize the activity associated with a particular interest -these can be temporal keywords (e.g. evening) or action keywords (e.g. watch) that specify an action associated with the category, respectively. The location dimension of an interest can often be obtained easily and precisely (e.g. GPS, E911 systems) -however, when the location is part of description (e.g. downtown), one has to consider extracting this information. In this work, we do not focus on location aspects of an interest.

We first explore what kind of keywords tweeters use most frequently and whether they contain content-indicative and/or usage-indicative keywords that could help identify user interests. Table 1 shows the results of top 20 words in our data set. We observe that there are quite a few keywords that indicate real-time interests. These are typically nouns (describing either the type of interest, e.g. game, or the time, e.g., tonight) or verbs (e.g., watch). We exclude pronouns, prepositions, helping verbs, question words, as well as a set of non-indicative words (e.g. just, so, have) from the dataset. Since we are not interested in grammatical context or latent semantic content, we further stem the words using Porter-stemming algorithm [9] (this removes any inflections from the dataset). Next, we analyze the filtered data set for occurrences of content and usage X  X ndicative keywords.
In order to efficiently mine the tweets, we first come up with an initial list of category keywords. We consult Wordnet 1 and IMDB 2 , as well as other city-specific event portals to form the list. We further enriched our seed list of keywords by manually inspecting thousands of tweets and including  X  X nterest X  X ndicative words X  observed therein. Based on empirical observations of the tweets, we finally identify five 5 seed categories, viz. movie, music, food, sports, dance , from the list of category keywords. Table 2 gives a snapshot of the seed categories and a few keywords corresponding to each of the seed categories.

Our list contains approximately 750 category words in total including commonly used synonyms. We have not considered hypernyms and hyponyms in this set. The list is next used by Lucene 3 for gathering frequency-based statistics of stemmed category keyword usages from the universal data set of tweets. Table 3 shows the top words http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ http://www.imdb.com http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/ used and percentage of total tweets containing these words. We observed fairly significant individual representations of certain category keywords, such as  X  X ame X  or  X  X usic X  belonging to the seed categories discussed in Table 2. Overall, considering all category keywords, we observed that in excess of 20% of total tweets (across the cities) contain atleast one keyword (detailed results are included in [8]). In other words, about a quarter of all tweets carry conextual information to suggest real-time user interests. Given the wide range of topics that people tweet about, these percentages are significantly encouraging for us to try and gain deeper insights into the nature of these interests.
Content-indicative keywords alone can provide little in-formation as regards to inferring activity-oriented user interests. However, other words present in a microblog qual-ifying the content-indicative keywords can provide valuable insights into user interests. These are, as defined earlier, usage-indicative keywords. For example, if the word  X  X ovie X  occurs along with  X  X o X  and  X  X omorrow X , it gives valuable insight that a user is most likely interested in going to a movie tomorrow. We explore two kinds of such category keyword neighboring terms: (i) action keywords  X  X erms indicating an action (e.g., go, see, look, etc.) and (2) temporal keywords terms indicating the temporal aspect of category or action keywords (e.g., today, tomorrow, etc.).
In order to gain insight on the type of such action and temporal words occurring in our data set, we use term frequency X  X ased measure to estimate the occurrences of both temporal and action words in the data set, with seed categories described earlier. The frequency of usage-indicative words (temporal/action) is shown in Table 4. We observed fairly high percentage of tweets containing action and temporal keywords such as tonight, weekend and go, watch that suggests the nature and temporal aspect of user intended activity. These words, when associated with category keywords, provide rich contextual information about real-time user interests.
 Table 5: Content-bearing tweets having action or temporal bigrams, as a percentage of tweets containing at least one content-bearing word Table 6: Category-wise breakdown of content-bearing tweets having action verb (bigrams), as a percentage of tweets containing at least one content-bearing word Table 7: Tweets having &lt; action-temporal &gt; bigrams
Next, we discover usage statistics of co-occurring content-indicative words and usage-indicative words. In the context of real-time interests, if a user is interested in an intention, s/he should use indicative action and/or temporal words to express his/her interests. e.g. I want to watch amovie tonight . Thus,usageofanactionortemporalwordalong with a category, indicates a higher information gain for any technique that we design for tagging tweets with intentions. We employ bigram-based analysis of category words (co-occurring with action verbs or temporal words) and report a few observations. Co-occurring words (in general, for bigrams) can be at a variable distance (characters) from each other. However, since a tweet is only 140 characters in length, we employ a tolerance limit of 5 words and discover gappy bigrams where one word in the bigram is a category word, and the other is an action/temporal word. Table 5 gives a snapshot of the percentage of content-bearing tweets having bigrams with action or temporal words.

We observe that approximately 20% of content-bearing tweets contain action verbs, and hence possibly talk about real-time interests. Moreover, it was observed that tweeters possibly use content-bearing words in several other senses as well (e.g. a movie review, a game report etc.). Some manual observation of these tweets revealed (in London) a lot of the postings are about Manchester United and Chelsea games. It is interesting to note the similarity of statistics across the candidate cities (Table 5)-thereby implying a uniform trend in the manner in which people tend to express interests in terms of a category (content-bearing word) and a action/temporal qualifier. Bigrams containing temporal words are lower compared to those containing action verbs -possibly due to the fact that temporal terms act as further qualifiers (after action verbs).

Several other interesting observations and their implications-e.g. maximum association of an action verb with the music category (Table 6) and percentage of action-temporal co-occurrences (Table 7), along with their implications are discussedin[8].
Motivated by the need to capture real-time user interests for an activity-oriented social network, we investigated and evaluated microblogs (i.e. Twitter) as a potential source of contextual information about its users. An initial pass through millions of tweets collected from ten cities across the world revealed the presence of enough indicative keywords that express meaningful user interests. This seed set was then used to generate an exhaustive list of keywords, and statistical techniques applied to discover associations between these words. Further, standard mining techniques revealed a number of words and their co-occurrences that are indicative of user interests. While not described here due to lack of space, the patterns discovered (in terms of words and their usage) were also validated against a set of benchmarked tweets. Finally, using classification-based techniques (details discussed in [8]), we report a reasonable accuracy in terms of classifying user tweets w.r.t. the context (i.e. interests, intentions, activities) that is embedded therein.

The insights obtained in this paper provide significant justification for contextual analysis of micro-blogs. We believe that there exists ample scope for research in terms of extracting rich context from social media sites  X  e.g. identifying user context such as emotions, presence, location etc. With the rapid evolution of mobile technologies, social media is poised to generate huge volumes of real-time consumer data. Such data presents a unique opportunity for sophisticated analytic tools and next-generation  X  X ocial X  applications. Our work is a step in this direction.
