 1. Introduction
Information visualization offers a unique means to enable users to handle invisible abstract information by taking advantage of their visual perception capabilities. By presenting information visually, it is possible for human beings to use more of their perceptual abilities in understanding information. This ability of the human mind to rapidly perceive visual information makes information visualization not only useful, but also powerful and necessary tool for information discovery. Information visualization is a highly efficient way for people to directly perceive data and discover knowledge and insight from it. The application of the visualization technique to information retrieval really broadens the horizon of information retrieval.
Visualization for information is not merely a simple way to present information and search for results, it also provides an interactive environment for people to explore, discover, analyze, and tap into information.
The visual environments contain richer information than traditional information systems due to two -or three-dimensional characteristics. Visualization environment offers an intuitive context with which people can make a decision on whether objects are relevant or irrelevant. It deals more easily with highly hete-rogeneous and noisy data, and requires no understanding of complex mathematical algorithms (Keim, 2001). In summary, it extends a system X  X  capacity beyond what a traditional information system can reach. 1.1. Hyperlink structure analysis A hyperlink structure employs a linked concept, keyword, phrase, etc. as an anchor within a document.
For this research a document is defined broadly as a traditional article, webpage, or electronic textual object. Hyperlinks enable users to jump from one document to another document very easily. They inte-grate and connect related concepts, keywords, or phrases in a very natural way. The application of a hyperlink structure in a full text context fits people X  X  reading behavior. However, a hyperlink structure can also create problems if not applied properly. The ability to discriminate and distinguish among hyperlink-based documents in the ever-increasing volume of information available through the networks is becoming more and more difficult (Berghel, Berleant, Foy, &amp; McGuire, 1999). These problems are summarized as follows: (a) A major concern in hyperlink-based systems is disoriented in the hyperlink-based information space. (b) There is no mechanism that can indicate the extent to which a linking document and its linked (outgo-(c) With an increase of hyperlinks within a single document, especially within a diverse and comprehensive (d) Users cannot know whether all linked documents are sensitive or related to some subjects or topics that
These problems prevent users from effectively and efficiently utilizing hyperlink-based information re-sources and they cannot be solved via using traditional means and methods. The situation calls for new methods, means, avenues, and techniques to solve the problems. 1.2. Related prior works
There is a great deal of research addressing visualization for hyperlink-based WWW information and describing various models. A hierarchy of hyperlinks among pages within a website is visualized, where the visual spaces are presented as interlinked local maps to facilitate navigation on the Internet (Durand &amp;
Kahn, 1998; Hightower, Ring, Helfman, Bederson, &amp; Hollan, 1998). Hyperbolic technique is widely used to present hyperlink structures (Eick, 2001; Munzner, 1998; Robert &amp; Lecolinet, 1998) because of its dynamic and flexible feature for information representation.

Graphic and other features are usually employed to express semantic information in development of a visualization model. For instance, some systems use position along a scale (Hochheiser &amp; Shneiderman, 2001; Olsen, Korfhage, Sochats, Spring, &amp; Williams, 1993), angle (Zhang, 2001; Zhang &amp; Korfhage, 1999), distance (Havre, Hetzler, Perrine, Jurrus, &amp; Miller, 2001; Nuchprayoon &amp; Korfhage, 1994; Zhang &amp;
Korfhage, 1999), area (Ding, Chowdhury, Foo, &amp; Qian, 2000; Rorvig &amp; Fitzpatrick, 2000; Wise, 1999), volume (Young &amp; Shneiderman, 1993), citation (Noyons, Buter, &amp; van Raan, 2000; Small, 1999; White, 2003), hierarchy relationships (Kleiberg, van de Wetering, &amp; van Wijk, 2001; van Ham &amp; van Wijk, 2002; Yang, Ward, &amp; Rundensteiner, 2002), and so on.
 Visual information systems, such as VIBE (Morse, Lewis, &amp; Olsen, 2000, 2002; Olsen &amp; Korfhage, 1994;
Olsen et al., 1993), InfoCrystal (Spoerri, 1993), LyberWorld (Hemmje, 1995; Hemmje, Kunkel, &amp; Willett, 1994), and VR-VIBE (Benford, Greenhalgh, Snowdon, Ingram, &amp; Knox, 1995; Churchill, Snowdon,
Benford, &amp; Dhanda, 1997), define points of interest (reference points) (Korfhage, 1997) and use the sim-ilarity ratios between an object and the defined reference points to position that object in a two-or three-dimensional visual space. This similarity ratio-based algorithm is expected to achieve a good controllability for projected objects in a visual space because of the manipulability of the reference points in the visual spaces. The major advantages of this projection model reside in flexibility of visual information presen-tation, simplicity of the algorithm, and manipulability of defined reference points. Notice that in these systems the defined reference points can only be manipulated manually. Observe that there is no central interest point within the visual spaces and role of the reference points are the same. The systems must work within a multiple reference point environment.

In summary, the analyses show that most of the hyperlink-based information visual tools only visualize hyperlinks between connected pages and they rarely distinguish the extent to which they are related.
Current visual information systems hardly use object movement and object speed as the means to express semantic relationships among projected objects, and no similarity ratio algorithm has been applied to hyperlink structures.

The objectives of the proposed visualization model are to provide users with a visual browsing and retrieval environment, to visualize hyperlink structures, to display the extent to which a linking document and its linked documents are relevant, to adopt the similarity ratio algorithm to the hyperlink structure projection, to develop a retrieval mechanism for hyperlink structures, and to facilitate users X  decision-making during navigation.

It is worth pointing out that the proposed model can be applied to various link-based environments. It is apparent that the model can be used to visualize a hyperlink-based website. In this case, the hyperlink-based information space is the Internet and documents are webpages. The WebStar model can also be employed for bibliographic citation analysis in a bibliographic document database, where citations in a publication are regarded as links. This model also can be applied to hyperlink-based help file systems within applications or hypertext document authoring systems such as Storyspace (Bernstein, 2002). Another interesting potential application is that the WebStar model can be used to visualize results of a search engine when the relevance between a query and a retrieved webpage is treated as a semantic link or virtual  X  X  X ink X  X .
 2. Definition of the visual space and visualization algorithm analysis 2.1. Data structure description
The WebStar visualization model is built on a vector-based data structure. Suppose there is a hyperlink-based document space. A central document can be specified by users. This central document is a starting point. It hyperlinks multiple documents. A vector-based space can be defined based on the central docu-ment and connected documents. In other words, all keywords in the vector-based space will be extracted from both the specified central document and all connected documents. They are then normalized based on a standard lexical database. Notice that since users can arbitrarily select a specified central document, it suggests that the content of this vector-based database is dynamic. It requires that the database contents be updated immediately when users browse a different central document of interest. However, updating the database would not be a major concern because the number of connected documents is relatively small, and therefore the number of extracted keywords is not significantly large. This makes the database update manageable.

Eq. (1) is defined as the vector-based space. The columns of the matrix V are indexing terms from documents. The rows of the matrix are the central document and its outgoing documents that are indexed by indexing terms (or keywords). In other words, the central document and its outgoing documents are treated equally in Eq. (1). The number of different indexing terms in V is n and the number of documents is m . Here t ij is defined as the weight of term j in document i . The above analysis shows that contents of the matrix V , including the two parameters n and m , are changeable due to the fact that when a central document can be replaced by any of its hyperlinked documents or other documents. Since this vector space only covers a limited number of documents, the value of either parameter n or m is not significantly large, which will assure that the model responds to a user X  X  request in a tolerable time when database is updated.
The webpage term matrix in WebStar is dynamic. That is, when the central document changes, this matrix must be reconstructed accordingly. Notice that each of connected documents within the central document is not added to the matrix one by one. Instead, all terms from all related documents are extracted and normalized first. The weight of an extracted term is then calculated. After that it is compared with a
Otherwise, it will be eliminated. It suggests that the matrix is not built until all keywords from related documents are extracted, normalized, weighted and selected. That is, the number of the matrix columns is exactly equal to the number of selected keywords from connected documents, and therefore, an extracted keyword from any related document (regardless of its size) can fit in the matrix properly. 2.2. Description of the visual space
The visual space of the WebStar model is defined in a two-dimensional space (see Fig. 1). The origin of visual space is determined by two parameters h i and b i . The projection distance h similarity between the central point C and that document D affected by a group of selected subjects ( T i ) (to be discussed later). 2.2.1. Definition of the projection distance
There are many available similarity algorithms that can be used to calculate the similarity between two documents in a vector-based document space. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. The iso-content-based angle similarity measure (Zhang &amp; Rasmussen, 2001), used in the WebStar model, integrates the strengths of both the distance and direction of compared objects into the measure. It achieves better performance than either the distance-oriented measure or the direction-oriented measure (Zhang &amp; Ras-mussen, 2002).

The similarity S i between C (the central document) and D defined as
The distance between two documents ( V i  X  t i 1 ; t i 2 ; ... ; t defined as
In Eq. (2), d i is the angle formed by the central document C and the connected document D origin in the matrix space V , and a is a constant used to control the extent to which the distance strength impacts on the similarity measure. The constant a has a value between 0 and 1. Research shows that when the specified document C and d 0 is the distance from the origin of the space V to a measured connected document D i . Because 0 &lt; a j d d 0 j 6 1(0 &lt; a 6 1) and 0 6 cos 0 6 S i 6 1. For simplicity we use a three-dimensional matrix space V to illustrate the relationships of the defined variables and parameters in Eq. (2) (see Fig. 2).

This similarity S i can be converted to the projection distance h a projected document in the visual space in Eq. (4). Mag is a positive constant that can be used to control the visual display area size. Since the valid value of S i either positive or zero. From Eq. (4), all connected documents will be scattered within a display sphere (see
Fig. 1) whose radius is Mag. By changing Mag, users can zoom in/out of the visual display area. Eq. (4) suggests that the more similar the central document is to a connected document (larger value of S nearer the connected document is to the central document or origin of the visual space; and vice versa.
Irrelevant documents ( S i  X  0) are located near the edge of the sphere and far away from the central point. 2.2.2. Definition of the projection angle
A subject consists of several keywords, which reflects user X  X  interests. Users can define multiple subjects at will. Each of the subjects can be expressed in the form of a vector similar to a document in the matrix space V (see Eq. (5)). The weights for a subject vector are assigned based on the user X  X  emphasis. These subject points can be projected onto the display sphere of the visual space (see T position of an individual subject on the sphere can be arbitrary. Subjects X  positions on the sphere in conjunction with their relevance to the central document ultimately affect the positions of all connected documents.
 should be exactly equal to n in Eq. (1), and the definition of columns of V
The difference between these two vectors is that t i in Eq. (5) is assigned by users while t calculated based on keyword distributions in the central document and its connected documents. In other words, Eq. (5) is more subjective while Eq. (1) is more objective in terms of determination of their weights.
The structure of Eq. (1) ultimately determines the structure of Eq. (5). The contents of both structures are dynamic.

The similarity between a subject T k and a hyperlinked document D calculated based on the similarity measure (see Eq. (2)) because T
D the number of hyperlinked documents within a central document.

The angle of subject T k and the X -axis against the origin of the visual space is a parameter a k is always available after subject T k is positioned on the display sphere.

After the subjects are positioned on the sphere, the projection angle of a projected document D fined as If a connected document D i is irrelevant to any of the selected subjects ( defined as zero to avoid the meaningless b i from Eq. (6). It is obvious that connected documents that are not relevant to any of the defined subjects will be projected onto the X -axis. Their distances, which are determined by the relevance between them and the central document to the origin, may vary.
According to Eqs. (4) and (6), both the projection distance and projection angle of a connected docu-ment to the central document in the visual space are clearly defined, and therefore any of the connected documents can be accurately projected onto the visual space.

It is worth noting out that the WebStar model does not have to operate under a multiple-subject environment due to the constant presence of the central point in the visual space. The model uses a central focus point which is always available and then projects its outgoing documents. The central point is always available. The central point plus one single subject point can determine the position of any connected documents in the visual space (see both Eqs. (4) and (6)). It is this unique characteristic that distinguishes the WebStar model from the other similarity-ratio-based visualization models. 2.3. Impact of a moving subject point on the document distribution in the visual space
In this model, users can activate one of the defined subjects on the display sphere and make it rotate evenly around the display sphere. Since a subject affects the projection angle of a connected document in the visual space (Eq. (6)), a subject rotation would have an impact on the visual distribution of projected documents. This distribution change can be used to judge whether connected documents are relevant to a moving subject. Now let us address the impact of a moving subject point on each connected document within the visual space.

Given the moving speed of a selected subject T r (its initial angle in the visual space is a the number of defined subjects) is h degrees per second.

Dynamic angle of a document D i is defined as where t is a time variable and h 0 is the initial angle of D
From Eq. (7), we have
Eq. (8) indicates that the rotation speed of a connected document angle, caused by a moving subject, is linear. In other words, all affected documents will move evenly around the central point of the visual space.
Different documents may correspond to different moving speeds and orbits. Velocity of a connected doc-ument is affected primarily by the similarity (or relevance) between the moving subject and that document.
Since the relevance between the central document and a connected document is a constant, the orbit of the moving document should be a circle and its central point is the origin of the visual space.
According to Eq. (7), after the selected subject point T r degrees from its original position:
It is clear that when there is no relevance between a moving subject and a connected document (or the similarity between them is zero), that document stays in the same position as the subject moves. If a document is only relevant to the specified moving subject and it is not relevant to other defined subjects, then it has the same moving speed as the moving subject and it is always located on the line formed by the central point and the moving subject. Eq. (7) suggests that the more relevant a connected document to a moving subject point, the faster the document moves; and vice versa. The maximum speed of a relevant document is same as the moving subject.

It is evident that the relevance of a document to other subjects not only affects its initial position in the visual space but also affects its moving speed because the sum of all similarities between the document and all subjects is the divisor in Eq. (7). This divisor document and the moving subject ( S ri ) as well as the subject moving speed h ultimately determines the moving speed of a connected document in the visual space. 2.4. Ambiguity analysis
Projection ambiguity in a visual space refers to the phenomena that multiple objects (documents, in this case) in a high-dimensional space are scattered onto one point in a low-dimensional space. Projection ambiguity is inevitable due to spatial dimensionality reduction. It is no exception for this model. In fact, projection ambiguity raises two basic questions: (1) Whether objects (documents) close to each other in the high-dimensional document matrix space are still close in the visual space after the projection. (2) Whether projected objects close to each other in the visual space are also close to each other in the high-dimensional document matrix space V .

The answer to the first question is straightforward and explicit. Eqs. (4) and (6) imply that as long as objects are located together in the matrix space V , they would be clustered together in the visual space after projection.

The answer to the second question is more complicated. The crux of this question is how to identify projected points with the same position in the visual space but that have quite different locations in the the same similarity value even though they may be far away from each other in terms of the distance in the matrix space V . To illustrate this, suppose there is in a three-dimensional matrix space V , C is the central point, and documents D 1 , D 2 , and D 3 on a circle have the same similarity value in terms of the defined similarity measure (Eq. (2)) because these three points have the same angle d and the same distance d
Fig. 3). It is clear that points D 1 and D 2 are very close while D space V . However, the three points have the same projection distance value via the conversion procedure (Eqs. (3) and (4)).

According to Eq. (6), if the points D 1 and D 3 have the same projection angle, the following equation should be satisfied:
In this equation, both S k 1 and S k 3 are constants if subjects are selected and a
This means that if a q and a p , the projection angles of subject q and subject p , respectively, meet the condition in Eq. (11), D 1 and D 3 will be scattered onto the same point in the visual space. Another scenario is that the positions of selected subjects on the display sphere can also cause ambiguity.
In a static state (no moving subject point), a projected document D the visual space while the document D 1 may not be relevant to D than the projection algorithm. For instance, three subjects T relevant to the subjects T 1 and T 2 and it is irrelevant to T and it is irrelevant to both T 1 and T 2 . Similarity between D between D 2 and O , indicating that the projection distance from the origin to either D visual space. For locations of T 1 , T 2 , and T 3 , see Fig. 4. The projection angles of subjects T p = 2, respectively. According to Eq. (6), the projection angle of either D
It is apparent that this kind of ambiguity, not caused by projection, could mislead users too. Fortunately, moving any of the subject points on the display sphere can disambiguate overlapping points. Moving T makes D 2 rotate around the origin (not D 1 ) while moving either T (not D 2 ). In any case, D 1 and D 2 will be separated.

Another case of ambiguity is that D 0 1 and D 0 2 are not relevant to any defined subject and they have the same projection distance. They are projected onto one point on the X -axis in the visual space (see D in Fig. 4). In this case, movement of any subject has no impact on both D disambiguate D 0 1 and D 0 2 is to replace the current central point with another linked document because this may change their projection distances and make them separate.

In summary, the above analysis shows that objects with the same similarity value based on in Eq. (2) may be located in quite different places in the matrix space V ; these objects may be projected onto the same point in the visual space; and changing positions of subjects on the display sphere can effectively separate the overlapping points to avoid the projection ambiguity. However, when the overlapping objects are not related to any defined subject, the current central point must be replaced by another document to separate them. If the objects with similar similarity values are close to each other in the matrix space V , they should be always clustered together regardless of subject movement in the visual space. The locations of selected subjects may also result in ambiguity. This is quite different from the ambiguity caused by projection in nature. Moving a related subject point can solve the problem if the documents are related to any of the defined subjects. 2.5. Visual display of information retrieval
The WebStar model allows users to retrieve relevant hyperlinks within the visual space. Users can define a radius or threshold for a search in the visual space. This radius determines a retrieval sphere (contour) within which all included projected documents are regarded as retrieved results. The sphere center is the origin. The maximum value for the radius is Mag because Mag (see Eq. (4)) defines the boundary of the visual display and no document can be projected outside this boundary. Increasing the radius will lead to an increase in the number of retrieved documents; and vice versa. It is obvious that as the radius increases, the relevance between the central document and newly added documents decreases. In this retrieval mode, users can select a radius, which would automatically create a retrieval contour in the visual space, and all re-trieved documents within that contour are colored differently so that users can easily distinguish them from the not-retrieved documents (see Fig. 5). Notice that this retrieval feature is limited to all outgoing doc-uments of a specified document. However, the method can be employed to visually display a search result if this visualization model is applied to a search engine (to be discussed in Section 3.2). 3. Applications 3.1. Internet application
WebStar is designed to work in environments where the hyperlink technique is the dominant infor-mation organization method. Since the Internet is a hyperlink-based information system, WebStar can definitely be applied to it. Users start with a specified website of interest. The model treats this website of interest as the central point so it will be located at the origin of the visual space. This webpage needs to be parsed so that all hyperlinks within it can be included and processed. All meaningful keywords from the central webpage and connected webpages are extracted and normalized to form a Web matrix space V .
Based on the matrix space V , similarities between the central page and all hyperlinked webpages can be calculated, and then these similarity values are converted to their projection distance values in the visual space. These projection distances will be the distances from the pages to the origin in the visual space. In other words, users can judge the relevance of any connected webpage to a central website of interest based on how close they are in the visual space. That is, all hyperlinked webpages are gravitated semantically to the central page. The relevant webpages are near the origin and the less relevant webpages are more distant from it. In this sense, users can clearly and intuitively understand the extent to which the connected webpages are relevant to the central webpage of interest.

In most of cases, a webpage covers multiple topics but users may be interested in only some of them when browsing that webpage. WebStar allows users to define topics (subjects) they are interested in and to demonstrate how relevant the selected topics (subjects) are connected to the webpages. This would help users make a decision about whether to further explore the connected webpages or where to go. Elsewhere the model provides users with a list of keywords extracted from a central webpage of interest and its connected webpages. Users can generate several subjects based on this keyword list. Each keyword is as-signed a weight according to its importance to users X  needs. After the subjects are defined and selected, they are put on the display sphere in the visual space. The center of the sphere is the origin of the visual space and all projected webpages are scattered within the sphere. The positions of the selected subjects on the sphere will determine projection angles of all projected webpages in the visual space. The projection angle of a webpage in the visual space is computed based on the similarities between that webpage and all selected subjects on the visual sphere. It suggests that a change of a subject position may result in a change of the projected webpage distribution in the visual space. Users can activate a subject point and then make it move around the display sphere automatically. As the activated subject moves along the sphere, all related webpages rotate around the central point accordingly. The more relevant a webpage is to the moving subject point, the quicker it moves, and vice versa. Therefore, users can judge the relevance between a moving subject and webpages based on whether they move and how fast they move in the visual space.
Users can explore any webpage in the visual space. For instance, users can pick up any webpage in the visual space as a new central page (the website of interest) after they browse its content. After a new website replaces the old one, all projected webpages are updated accordingly. The new central point as well as new connected webpages will replace the old ones, thereby changing the visual distribution in the visual space.
In the retrieval mode, users can select a meaningful retrieval contour to narrow down or expand the results of a search. After the contour is generated, all projected webpages are divided into two groups: those retrieved and those not retrieved. In addition, the number of the retrieved webpages and their titles can be presented to users. The icon color of retrieved webpages changes so that users can easily identify them in the visual space. 3.2. Other potential applications
Basically, the model is designed to visualize link structures. It suggests that if information is organized using a link-structural or a similar method, then the WebStar model can be applied to it. For instance, it can visualize a hypertext-based help system where topics are hyperlinked. This kind of help system is widely implemented in applications or hypertext document authoring systems. In these cases, the WebStar model would offer users a visual environment to explore a help information space.

WebStar can be employed for bibliographic citation analysis in a bibliographic document database as follows: Consider a scenario where there are references in a standard publication and each reference acts as a physical link that can be directed to a cited paper. If the model picks up a publication as the central point of the visual space and users define several subjects of interest and project them on the display sphere, then all cited papers can be visually presented in the visual space. It will offer a unique way for users to do a visual bibliographic citation analysis. Visual display of cited papers in the visual space shows which cited papers are most relevant to the citing paper, which cited papers are semantically clustered together, and which cited papers are relevant to a defined subject. In addition, the model enables users to retrieve the most relevant cited papers and to discover new related topics by changing the central point within the visual space.
 Another potential application is that the model can be used to visualize results from a search engine.
When users submit a query to a search engine, it returns a linear results list. If we treat that query as the central point in the visual space, then all returned webpages can be regarded as  X  X  X onnected X  X  webpages.
Notice that although there are no physical hyperlinks between that query and returned webpages, there are definitely semantic connections between them. The semantic strength between a query and a returned that we can use to calculate their projection distances for projection. Similarly, users can define a group of subjects and position them on the display sphere as described in the previous discussion, which are em-ployed to generate the projection angles for the returned webpages. So, any returned webpage can have the two parameters: projection distance and projection angle. This implies that a returned webpage can be effectively projected onto the visual space like a hyperlinked webpage. One concerns of this application is how to control the number of returned webpages visualized in the visual space. The number of the returned hits for a search may reach hundreds or even more. However, it is not necessary to visualize all of them in the visual space. Research findings have shown that most searchers only browse one or two pages of a result list, in fact, 90% of search engine traffic comes from the first 30 hits retrieved ( http://www.imarketing-masters.com/graphs.htm ). Therefore, the model can select the first 20 X 50 returned webpages and display them in the visual space. 4. Discussion 4.1. Display of multiple levels of hyperlinks in the visual space
A hyperlink structure can be viewed as a hierarchy if a specified document is regarded as a root of that structure and all connected documents as its children nodes. That is, all connected documents are siblings at the first level of the hierarchy. Similarly, all their hyperlinks (of the first level) can be positioned at the second level of the hierarchy and each of them can be expanded in the same way, and so on. It is apparent that this proposed visualization model displays only one level of a hyperlink hierarchy within the visual space. If this model expands to visualize multiple levels of a hyperlink hierarchy, it would offer richer and deeper information for users. However, it may raise a new question: How does one effectively display numerous documents within a limited display area after the multiple levels of a hyperlink hierarchy are visually presented? It is quite clear that as the number of presented hierarchy levels increases, the number of all visualized documents increases dramatically. Another concern is that this expansion is at expense of the dynamic subject control feature. If multiple hyperlink levels are applied, hyperlinked documents have to be connected to their parent node. The relevance will be calculated based on a document and its parent page rather than the root node (the center) of the hierarchy. If that is the case, it is impossible to compute the projection angle parameter for that document. 4.2. Automatically extracting keywords for the subject group
In this model, users are able to yield a group of subjects based on their interests and use them to analyze linked documents. It requires human intervention. If the model could automatically generate a group of subjects based on keyword distributions within a central page and its connected documents, it would de-crease human intervention and improve system use convenience. For this to happen, the model has to add a new algorithm to automatically generate subjects. This group of subjects will be put on the display sphere by default after the visual distribution is generated. In the meantime, the model still preserves the feature that users can customize these subjects via revising contents of subjects or create new subjects. 4.3. An option for subject content
Usually, there are a variety of information media types within a document, for instance, textual information, images, audio, video, animation, and so on. A document may be associated with multiple information media types. If these types are employed as the subjects and put on the display sphere, users can easily understand the connected documents from the perspective of information media type. Notice that in this case keywords (information media types), used to form a subject, are no longer dynamic and it is relatively easy for the model to obtain the information automatically by parsing related documents. 4.4. Multiple subject movement
In the present model, only one subject point is allowed to rotate around the center. If multiple subjects are allowed to orbit around the center, then the impact of multiple subjects on the document distribution can be observed simultaneously. We even can set two opposite moving directions for two moving subject points: one clockwise and the other counterclockwise. Objects related to one subject are easily compared with those related to the other subject because their moving directions are different in the visual space. 4.5. Effective display of projected objects in the visual space
In the original VIBE system, the projected objects in the system visual space are documents in the system. In this case, the VIBE system as a visualization tool cannot visualize all documents in a database because overwhelming display of an enormous amount of documents in a limited visual space would make presented documents indistinguishable in the visual space. Therefore, the system has to filter documents or narrow down projected documents to a relatively smaller topic to maintain a reasonable size of presented documents in the visual space. However, in the WebStar system, projected objects are citing hyperlinks within a document (For instance, a website). These links are designed to connect relevant documents rather than to limit websites. Notice that the number of citing hyperlinks within a document is very small com-pared to the number of all documents in a database. Citing hyperlinks within a document is manageable in the WebStar space. 4.6. Usability studies for this model
In this paper, our emphasis is the theoretical proof of the WebStar model. Theoretical proof of a model is fundamental and essential. It is crucial for a system X  X  development. Without a solid theoretical foun-dation, potential loopholes would lead to not only system malfunction but also system failure. We understand that theoretical soundness of a model does not mean that it can assure a system developed from that model can achieve good usability performance. There are many other factors that would affect system usability performance such as system interface design. This issue is to be addressed in another paper. 5. Conclusions
In this paper, an information visualization model is introduced to visualize hyperlink-based information systems. WebStar is designed to visualize hyperlink structures. All projected documents are within a two-dimensional visual space. The position of a projected document in the visual space is determined by both the similarity between the document and a specified central document and the similarities between that document and a group of selected subjects. The specified central point is dynamic and it can be replaced by any hyperlinked document. Replacement of the central point can lead to change of the visual distribution in the visual space. Changing to other subject contents also can cause a change in the visual distribution. Relocation of subject positions on the display contour in the visual space can change the visual distribution.
However, change of a central point results in change of projected documents while change of either subject contents or subject positions on the display sphere just results in relocation of projected documents in the visual space.

The model provides users with an interactive retrieval option. In the retrieval mode, users can define a retrieval sphere at will within which documents are regarded as retrieved results. By changing the radius of the sphere, users can control retrieved results.

Like other information visualization models, this projection algorithm can cause ambiguity within the visual space. There are two kinds of the projection ambiguities: one from semantic relationships of pro-jected objects in a database and the other from positions of selected subjects on the display sphere. Analysis shows that moving a related subject on the display sphere can effectively disambiguate overlapping pro-jected points in the visual space.

The visualization model has potential to be applied to the Internet, hypertext-based help file systems, hypertext document authoring systems, and bibliographic citation analysis as well. The model can expand to visualize a returned hits list from an Internet search engine.

The uniqueness of this visualization model is not only the use of spatial features of projected objects but also their movements and speeds to demonstrate relevance among objects. In the visual space, locations of objects and distances between objects reflect their internal semantic connections. In addition, movement and speed of projected objects within the visual space adds a new dimension to illustrate semantic rela-tionships between projected objects and specified subjects.

Future research directions include, but not are limited to, the display of multiple levels of hyperlinks in the visual space, automatic extraction of keywords for the subject group, other alternatives for subject group contents, and usability studies. References
