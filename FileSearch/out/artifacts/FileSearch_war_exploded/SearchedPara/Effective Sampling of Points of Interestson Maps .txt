 On map services such as Google Maps, we can obtain the aggregate statistics (e.g., sum, average and distribution) of PoIs (e.g., restaurants) to get more ben-efit. For this work, we need to acquire all PoIs within a region. However, the fact is most map service suppliers wouldn X  X  like to provide the entire PoI databases. In addition, the vast majority of public APIs restrict the number of queries per day for each user, and the largest number of results returned. Therefore, we have to estimate aggregate statistics by sampling methods. The existing sam-pling methods have been proved to sample PoIs with biases which require a large number of queries to eliminate the biases. Besides, Wang et al. [ 5 ] proposed new methods to remove sampling bias which randomly samples some fully accessible regions from an area of interest and collects PoIs within sampled regions. tion. Since it is to sample PoIs on the map, we can use information about the related road networks to further improve the efficiency of aggregate statistical estimation. According to observations, in general, the areas with intensive road networks such as urban districts, have dense distributions of PoIs. So we can conduct preprocessing by utilizing the information about road networks. On the one hand, the road network information can be easily obtained, and don X  X  occupy the online query time. On the other hand, the road network information is rela-tively static, rather than obviously dynamic. In this paper, we propose sampling methods that make use of the information of road networks to preprocess a large area of interest to estimate aggregate statistics.
 Related Work. Several papers have dealt with the problem of crawling and downloading information present in search engine [ 1 ], unstructured Hidden Web [ 2 ] and structured Hidden Web [ 3 ]. Some of these methods depend on knowing the exact number of results for a query, which is not available in our setting. For estimating structured Hidden Web, the sampling methods proposed in [ 4 ]have a limitation inputs which must be specified as categorical input and need a large number of queries to reduce biases. So these methods cannot be directly applied into the application for sampling PoIs on maps. If A is the area of interest, P is the set of PoIs within the region A . Sum aggregate is f s ( P )= p . Average aggregate is f a ( P )= 1 | P | all PoIs in P . In addition, let  X  =(  X  1 ,..., X  J ) be the distribution of set of PoIs which has several labels as { l 1 ,...,l J } , where  X  with label l j .If L ( p ) is the label of a PoI p to specify a certain property, so  X  = that equals one when predicate L ( p )= l m is true, and zero otherwise. RRZI URSP. From the initial region A , the random region zoom-in (RRZI) uniformly divides the current region into two non-overlapping sub-regions, and then randomly selects a non-empty sub-region as the next region with same probability to zoom in and query. Repeat this procedure recursively until a fully accessible region which includes PoIs less than k is observed. To correct sampling bias, we add a counter  X  to record the probability of sampling a sub-region. Because the information of road networks is local,we can divide a region further by utilizing its road network to decrease the number of queries. However, public map APIs might impose a limit on the size of the input region.To solve this problem, we can select a small sub-region from a large region as the input of RRZI. Wang et al. [ 5 ] introduces a uniform region sampling (URS). It divides a large region into 2 L small sub-regions, where L represents the number of iterative divisions. Let B L denote the 2 L regions set, and URS repeats to sample regions from B L at random until a non-empty region is observed.
 URSP. We further integrate URSP into RRZI to obtain a new sampling method, called RRZI URSP. URSP randomly selects a non-empty region b from B and then explores the intersection points within b . The region b whose number of intersection points is greater than the threshold h needs to further divide into two non-overlapping sub-regions. URSP repeats this procedure recursively until a region t whose number of intersection points is not more than h . Then RRZI URSP utilizes RRZI to sample a fully accessible region from the region t . RRZIC URSP. Different from RRZI, RRZIC requires map services can return a query including the number of PoIs within the input search region. Com-pared to RRZI URSP, RRZIC URSP has same preprocessing URSP and differ-ent RRZIC. Initially we set the URSP output region Q as the RRZIC input region A . If the number of PoIs within region Q is greater than the threhold k , the region Q is divided into two non-overlapping sub-regions Q formly. z , z 0 and z 1 present the number of PoIs within the region Q , Q respectively. Then RRZIC selects Q 0 with a probability z RRZIC repeats this procedure until a fully accessible region is observed. RRZI URSR/RRZIC URSR. Analogously, we extend URS to utilize the edges of road networks, called URSR. Then, we further integrate URSR into RRZI/RRZIC to obtain a new sampling method, called RRZI URSR/RRZIC URSR. In our experiments, we use the real-world road networks and PoIs of Beijing as datasets which includes three types of information (vertices, edges and geos). Estimating n ( A ) . We evaluate the performance of the RRZI group methods for estimating n ( A ), the total number of PoIs within the area A . NRMSE ( X  n ( A )) = of both RRZI URSP and RRZI URSR are much less than that of RRZI URS, about decreasing 20% when L&lt; 20. When L is very large, the effect of prepro-cessing is not obvious because the numbers of the intersection points or edges of roads within sub-regions by URS are relative small.
 Estimating Average and Distribution Statistics. Fig. 2 shows the results for estimating the average cost and distribution aggregate of restaurant-type PoIs for different methods. We can clearly see that RRZI URSP and RRZI URSR are more accurate than RRZI URS, and RRZIC URSP and RRZIC URSR are more accurate than RRZIC URS. From this figure, we can also see that the RRZIC group methods perform better than their corresponding methods in the RRZI group. In this paper, we proposed four effective sampling methods, which utilize the information of road networks to obtain unbiased estimations of PoI aggregate statistics, and conducted several experiments to investigate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Thus, it is visible that offline road network information has predictable positive effect on sampling PoIs on maps.
