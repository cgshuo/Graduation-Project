 comparing the Gh-index with the h-index. A discussion and conclusion are given in the final section. 2. Introduction of the Gh-index global set and undertake the comparisons between the global h core and the original h core. In particular, we define the Gh-index as follows: h-core (i.e., the GH-index and GH-core) are calculated in the usual way. The Gh-index of unit i (i.e., Gh i X  X  items included in the GH-core .
 Taking individual researchers as an example, we can formally write the formula of the Gh-index as follows:
We assume { p i } is the publication set of researcher i ; { c ( p i )} is the citation set of { p i }; h i is the h-index of researcher i ; h i -core is the h-core of researcher i ; GH is the h-index of the global unit (i.e., [ i  X  1 f p i g ); GH-core is the h-core of the global unit.
 Therefore, the Gh i -core and Gh i -index are defined as follows: where n is the total number of publications of researcher i . 2.1. Some observations Fig. 1 .

 in the publication number by rescaling it. We can then introduce a modified Gh-index: the Gh index as follows:
Similarly, we can then define the GH adj -core and the individual Gh increase of the publication number and therefore leads to a larger Gh-index (the Gh issue concerning what value to give this parameter and our suggestion is to adjust the a so that the GH
Medalists case, we increase the number of papers until the corresponding GH to 18, see Table 1 .
 of the researchers now have a different value of the Gh adj as to be seen below. 2.2. Theoretical analysis erties which are useful for our journal classification.

The above proof shows the monotonic property of the Gh-index (Gh classification. 3. The Gh adj -index and journal classification 3.1. The Global h-index for journal ranking data such as total publications ( N ), total citations (TC), the 5-year journal impact factor (JIF of the JIF 5 , currently one of the commonly used indicators for journal evaluation.
The Appendix A shows that the JIF 5 -based rank and the Gh-index (Gh have over 1000 publications. Some journals are ranked considerably lower according to the Gh known bibliometric indicators in Table 2 .
 than the others. We next compared the values of the h-index and the Gh shown in Table 3 , ranked in descending order of the h-index.
In terms of discriminatory power, we can see that the Gh adj index begins to yield tied values from approximately rank 12 onwards, while the Gh around rank 33 where the values approach zero.
 ing the Gh adj -index with the h-index, it is interesting to observe that the Gh papers than the others. Thus, it should to possible to classify journals by the difference between their Gh h-indices; this will be discussed in detail below.
 3.2. The introduction of X j journal classification
Our idea for journal classification is to explore the relationship between the h-and Gh
GH likely that its Gh adj -index will be larger than its h-index. That is to say, its Gh Table 4 .
 Property 1, the same is true for the journals in Class 2.

We can apply this approach to the same sample of journals for a new journal classification (denoted the X 2011 ). The 4 classes in the ABS2010 Journal Quality Guide are shown in Table 5 . The COPIOR ranking result (noted as COPIOR Class ) is included below for comparison purposes. that ranked highly in the ABS Class are also in the top of the X either irrelevant to the business field or not as important as the others, are all ranked lower in the X correlations. 3.3. The introduction of L j journal classification classification (noted as L j Class ) below.
