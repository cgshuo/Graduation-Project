 Previous studies of online user attention during informa-tion seeking tasks have mainly focused on analyzing searcher behavior in the web search settings. While these studies enabled better understanding of search result examination, their findings might not generalize for the tasks and search interfaces in other domains such as Shopping or Social Me-dia. In this paper we present, to best of our knowledge, the first cross-domain comparison of search examination behav-ior and patterns of aggregated attention across Web Search, News, Shopping and Social Network domains. We investi-gate how domain of the search and the scope of the infor-mation need affect search examination, and find significant differences beyond those arising from natural disparities be-tween individuals. For example, we find that the mean fix-ation duration, a common indicator of cognitive load, varies significantly across domains (e.g., mean fixation duration in the Social Network domain exceeds that of general Web Search by over 30%). We also find large differences in the aggregate patterns of user attention on the screen, especially in the Shopping and Social Network domains compared to the Web Search domain, emphasizing the need for domain specific user models and evaluation metrics.
 H.3.3 [ Information Systems ]: Information Storage and Retrieval Search result examination; user attention patterns; searcher behavior.
Success of any search system is largely determined by how well the system addresses information needs of its users. Hence, understanding of typical searcher behavior becomes imperative and instrumental for improving user experience with the search system. In this paper we use eye track-ing technology to gain a better understanding of user X  X  ex-perience with search systems in different domains, and for varying information needs. In addition to search interface usability, we analyze typical user attention on a computer screen, that summarize patterns of search interface usage by highlighting regions of the screen that users frequently attend.

Previous work [1, 5, 7] studied how users examine web search results. Researchers discovered  X  X olden triangle X  pat-tern found in examination of web search results. While a lot of focus was devoted to the Web Search setting, atten-tion during search in other domains remained relatively un-explored. Such search interfaces are substantially different from the ordinary web search interface. For example, search interface used by the Twitter service allows its users to ex-plore many more search results beyond top ten results of-fered by the web search engines. Hence, the findings that were reported in Web Search domain may no longer ap-ply to a domain specific search system. In this paper, we study user examination behavior across four different do-mains: Web Search (Google), News (CNN), Social Network (Twitter) and Shopping (Amazon). In addition to the do-main , we vary the scope of the information need by distin-guishing search tasks with Focused and Broad information need, as described in Section 3. We investigate the follow-ing research question ( RQ ). What are the typical patterns of attention during search, for different domains? We ad-dress the RQ by analyzing gaze metrics which are often used to assess cognitive load [4, 6] experienced by the users and amount of visual searching they perform [4, 9] using a particular search interface. We further investigate RQ by studying aggregated attention distribution in each domain (Section 4.2).
The related work focuses on eye tracking studies of web page usability and search result examination behavior.
Research on usability of web page design and interfaces has long relied on the eye tracking as a evaluation tool [9, 4, 7, 1, 2]. Eye movements recorded during evaluation sessions have been used to evaluate user interfaces on different di-mensions including cognitive load [9, 4], searching efficiency [2, 4], meaningfulness of cues [4, 9] and effectiveness of page layout [9]. Early study of Goldberg et al.[4] was one of the first to use eye movement data for evaluation of a search engine interface. In their study they found that users are biased to examine the search page either horizontally or ver-tically. Pan et al. [8] analyzed effects of page domain, page order, task and user gender on gaze examination behavior during a web page browsing. They experimented with four different page domains: Shopping, Search, News and Busi-ness . Our study is similar in the spirit to study of Pan et al., there are, however, important distinctions. First, we collect our data in a natural settings  X  instead of asking users to simply view the screenshot of a search page (as in [8]), we let users naturally interact with search interface, including issuing queries, clicking and navigating to other pages. Sec-ond, besides analyzing effects of search task and domain on cognitive load, we investigate differences of aggregate atten-tion caused by task and domain factors. Third, as of today, study of Pan et al. dates almost ten years, whereas search engines (and user X  X  habits) have significantly evolved during this time warranting revision of the topic.

In web search, Granka et al. [5] studied examination be-havior of search results. Their finding on  X  X op-to-bottom X  result examination behavior laid the ground for numerous user models and inspired idea of position discount in re-trieval evaluation metrics. One year later, Aula et al. [1] investigated individual differences in search result examina-tion and identified two common patterns of result exami-nation -exhaustive and economic examiners. They found significant correlation between mean fixation duration type pattern of examination (economic examiners had shorter fix-ation duration). Lorigo et al. [7] quantified distribution of user attention in Web Search domain and identified famous  X  X -shaped X  pattern. In this study we extend the prior work by analyzing effect of search domain and task on gaze exam-ination behavior. In addition, we quantify aggregate atten-tion distribution in Web Search , News , Shopping and Social Network domains.
In order to investigate our research questions we designed and conducted an eye tracking user study, in which we sys-tematically varied scope of the search task and the search domain . We experimented with two types of information need ( scope )  X  Focused and Broad and four different search domains: Web Search (Google), Shopping (Amazon), Social Network (Twitter) and News (CNN). Focused information need required users to find some specific information, e.g.  X  X ow many megapixels does Nexus 5 camera have? X  in Web Search domain, while Broad information need had no spe-cific answer and required users to read on or learn about a particular topic, e.g.  X  X earn what people on Twitter are say-ing about gay marriage X  in the Social Network domain. In order to capture natural user behavior we designed the tasks to reflect typical information needs encountered in a partic-ular domain. While during the user study we collected user interaction data on both search result and landing pages, in this paper we analyze user behavior only on the search result pages (not the landing pages).

We recruited 20 users (11 males) using university bulletin board. Each user was asked to perform four practice tasks to become familiar with the study flow, followed by the 16 tasks that we use in our analysis. Among the 16 tasks, each user performed four tasks in each of the four domains, i.e. two tasks per each ( domain , scope ) condition. We randomized presentation order of the tasks to eliminate possible learning effects. In order to eliminate possible confounding factors we balanced the study design by ensuring the same amount of data to be collected for each ( domain , scope ) pair.
To capture user X  X  eye movements we used Tobii T60 eye tracker system built into a 17 X  monitor with 1280  X  1024 screen resolution and allowing us to record eye movement with frequency of 60 Hz. The eye movement data was pro-cessed using Tobii Studio software to obtain fixations and saccades. All user actions, including query input, page nav-igation, clicks and mouse cursor movements were recorded using custom extension to the Firefox internet browser. Over-all, we collected eye movement and interactions data for 2890 page views, with 673 page views corresponding to the search pages. Specifically, we obtained data for 112 Web Search , 175 Social Network , 177 Shopping and 192 News page views.
We analyze the differences in user attention caused by do-main and task factors from two different perspectives. First, we analyze how domain and task affect usability of search in-terface measured with standard eye tracking metrics. Then, we analyze differences in distribution of user attention on the screen for different domains.
We adopt standard eye movement metrics to quantify dif-ferences in eye movement behavior due to domain and task factors. In this paper we focus on the following metrics: fix-ation duration, fixation spatial density, saccade amplitude and saccade rate. These metric are important as they quan-tify cognitive load and amount of searching experienced by the users [3, 2, 9]. Fixation Duration is by far the most common eye move-ment metric. It is commonly thought that most of the vi-sual information acquired by humans is processed during the fixation [6]. A longer fixation duration may indicate dif-ficulty in extracting information, or it may mean that the page content is more engaging [6]. Figure 1a shows mean fixation duration for each domain and task (whiskers indi-cate standard error of the mean). We performed the two-way repeated measured ANOVA, which revealed significant main effect for the domain factor (F(4,624)=7.04, p &lt; 0.001). The effects of task factor and the interaction were not found statistically significant (F(1,624)=0.188, p=0.665). We find that mean fixation duration varies significantly across do-mains, e.g. fixation duration increases on 30% from 288  X  13 ms in Search domain to 375  X  22 ms in Social Network . The latter fact suggests that users experience higher cognitive load when searching in Social Network , which is likely due complex nature of Twitter search results that include text, images and are less standardized compared to Google X  X  in-terface. Another reason for larger fixation duration in Twit-ter search can possibly be due to improper, sometimes pur-posefully misspelled or abbreviated language used in many Twitter posts, making Twitter results more difficult to read, compared to the typical web search results.
 Fixation Spatial Density was used to quantify locality of visual searching [3, 2]. As in the prior work [3, 2] in order to compute fixation spatial density we divide screen area using uniform grid of 10 x 10. Using the grid we calculate number of fixations falling to each of squares of the grid. The fixation spatial density is then defined as number of grid squares having one fixations or more, divided on total number of squares in the grid. Low fixation spatial density indicates focused and efficient searching, while relatively high fixation spatial density corresponds to evenly spread fixations and reflects widespread and inefficient searching [3].

Figure 1b shows mean fixation density for the experimen-tal conditions. The two-way ANOVA revealed significant main effect for the domain factor (F(4,624)=9.553, p &lt; 0.001) and the task factor (F(1,624)=9.658, p &lt; 0.002). Interaction between the factors was not found significant to have sig-nificant effect (F(1,624)=2.307, p=0.056). As illustrated in Figure 1b, for most domains, fixation spatial density de-creases in Broad tasks compared to Focused tasks.
 Saccade Amplitude allows us to measure extent of visual searching performed by the users. While no information is being encoded during saccades [6], saccades metrics are cru-cial for understanding of global nature of the eye movements on the page. Saccade amplitude is computed as Euclidean distance between saccade starting and end points. Larger saccade amplitudes represent moments when user X  X  atten-tion shifts from a current point of examination to a distant page region.

Figure 1c shows mean saccade amplitude for each exper-imental condition. The two-way ANOVA revealed signif-icant main effect for the domain factor (F(4,624)=14.526, p &lt; 0.001); the task factor was not found to have significant effect on saccade amplitude (F(1,624)=0.528, p=0.468). We observed large variation of saccade amplitude across the do-mains, ranging from 149  X  15 px in Web Search domain to 196  X  5 px in Shopping domain. We think this difference can be explained by the availability of faceted search function-ality (in Shopping domain), which was quite popular among the user study participants as we describe in Section 4.2. Saccade Rate indicates frequency of context switching by a user and provides another dimension to quantify efficiency of visual searching [4, 3]. Saccade rate is measured as to-tal number of saccades divided by the time spent on a web page in seconds. Figure 1d shows mean saccade rate for the experimental conditions. The two-way ANOVA revealed sig-nificant main effect for the domain factor (F(4,624)=6.167, p &lt; 0.001). The task and interaction effect were not found to have significant effect on saccade rate (F(4,624)=2.173, p=0.07). Consistent with our results on fixation duration, we find that in Search domain participants exhibited larger saccade rate, compared to Social Network domains.

To summarize, our findings show that search domain and scope significantly affect common eye tracking metrics re-lated to cognitive load and visual search efficiency.
In this section we analyze aggregate patterns of user atten-tion on the screen in each domain. Figure 2 shows attention aggregated for all search in each domain. In each heatmap the color indicates amount of the time user spent viewing a particular region of the screen (red color corresponds to large amount of time). As our goal is to analyze typical exami-nation patterns in each domain, we overlay heatmaps with a typical search page screenshot in the domain. However, since we plot aggregate attention, that is, from all searches, the overlaid page screenshot might not represent all pages in the domain, e.g., in Web Search , the advertisement on the right hand side or Knowledge Graph results may be present in some searches. Nonetheless, the heatmaps seem to align well with typical search page layout for most of the domains. Next to each heatmap we plot the marginal distribution of user X  X  attention on x and y dimensions.
 Figure 2a shows typical pattern of user attention in Web Search domain. Similar pattern was previously reported by several studies (e.g., [7]) and was termed as  X  X -shape X  or  X  X olden triangle X  due to the specific shape of attention dis-tribution that decays on both x and y directions and resem-bles triangle. The decay in viewing along y direction is often referred to as position bias in result examination (higher re-sults receive more attention because of the higher position and not necessarily higher relevance). While we clearly ob-serve position bias on y direction, the rate of attention decay on x is arguably even more pronounced in our data, suggest-ing that users do not often read the entire line of text from left to right, but rather examine several words in the begin-ning of the result title. The latter fact was not emphasized in prior research.

Figure 2b shows attention distribution for the News do-main. Compared to the Web Search , the News domain has significantly more sponsored search results. One large block of sponsored search results is positioned on top of the or-ganic results and another one is displayed on the right side of the page. Upon issuing the query, users not familiar with page layout in this domain seemed to be attracted by the sponsored search results, spending significant time on them (before realizing that the organic results are located closer to the center of the page). We observe the familiar triangu-lar pattern of attention positioned next to the first organic search result. The attention decays more rapidly on x and y dimensions than in the Web Search domain. Due to absence of commercial intent in user study tasks participants spent very little viewing advertisements on the right side.
In the Social Network domain (Figure 2c) we find that user attention distribution is very different from Web Search and News domains. On the vertical dimension most of the atten-tion is concentrated slightly below the center of the screen. The probability mass is also shifted along x direction  X  users mostly focus on Twitter posts appearing in the right half of the screen. We think this might be due to several reasons. The first is heterogeneity of Twitter search results, which are often comprised from most relevant user profiles (displayed at top of the page) and most relevant Twitter posts (dis-played towards the bottom of the first screen). The second is that participants preferred to keep their sight position rel-atively constant, and scroll down the page to retrieve more results from the stream spending most of their time viewing posts in the bottom half of the screen.

Figure 2d shows the distribution of attention in the Shop-ping domain. In contrast to other domains where attention is concentrated on main page content on x axis, in Shopping domain we find more uniform distribution across the hor-izontal and vertical dimensions. Remarkably, participants spent significant amounts of time on the faceted search fea-ture of the search interface (signified with hottest spot on the Figure 2d).

To summarize, our findings show the differences in the typical patterns of attention distribution during information search in different domains. These differences are caused by variation in web page layout and structure, which underlines a need for better understanding of the interplay between search task , domain and user attention, and the design of a search interface.
Our initial analysis of user attention on search interfaces in different domains emphasizes the ever growing need for better understanding of the interplay between search task , domain and user attention, and the design of a search inter-face. Our study is the first to compare search result exam-ination behavior across different domains and information needs. The findings provide important empirical evidence of attention variability across search interfaces, and under-line the need for more appropriate search interface specific user models and search engine evaluation metrics to better reflect user experience with the search system.
