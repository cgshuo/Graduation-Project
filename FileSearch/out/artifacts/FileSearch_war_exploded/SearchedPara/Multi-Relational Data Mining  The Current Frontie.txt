 existing data mining approaches are propositional and look for patterns in a single data table. Most real-world databases, however, store information in multiple tables.
 Lavra X c 2001), look for patterns that involve multiple tables (relations) from a relational database. To emphasize this fact, RDM is often referred to as multi-relational data min-ing (MRDM) (D X zeroski et al. 2002). We will adopt this term in the present special issue.
 data, it is natural that the patterns involve multiple rela-tions. They are typically stated in a more expressive lan-guage than patterns defined on a single data table. The major types of multi-relational patterns extend the types of propositional patterns considered in single table data min-ing. We can thus have multi-relational classification rules, multi-relational regression trees, and multi-relational asso-ciation rules, among others.
 field of machine learning, many MRDM algorithms come form the field of inductive logic programming (ILP, Muggle-ton 1992; Lavra X c and D X zeroski 1994). Situated at the in-tersection of machine learning and logic programming, ILP has been concerned with finding patterns expressed as logic programs. Initially, ILP focussed on automated program synthesis from examples, formulated as a binary classifica-tion task. In recent years, however, the scope of ILP has broadened to cover the whole spectrum of data mining tasks (classification, regression, clustering, association analysis). The most common types of patterns have been extended to their multi-relational versions and so have the major data mining algorithms (decision tree induction, distance-based clustering and prediction, etc.).
 data mining algorithms for various types of structured data. These include, for example, graph-based data mining. There is also an increasing body of work on mining tree-structured and XML documents. Mining data which consists of com-plex/structured objects also falls within the scope of MRDM, as the normalized representation of such objects in a rela-tional database requires multiple tables.
 trinsically relational has provided and continues to provide a strong motivation for the development of MRDM approaches. These include in the first place bioinformatics and more broadly computational biology. The World Wide Web and data mining tasks related to it, such as information extrac-tion follow closely. Related tasks, such as social network analysis also hold significant importance.
 multi-relational data mining (D X zeroski 2003). An extensive overview of the field is given by D X zeroski and Lavra X c (2001). The overview in this issue focusses on the most important approaches, giving a brief introduction to inductive logic programming, then covering several multi-relational data mining tasks and techniques, such as multi-relational as-sociation rules and multi-relational decision trees. cover important recent advances at the frontiers of multi-relational data mining. These include probabilistic logic learning (De Raedt and Kersting 2003), kernel-based learn-ing for structured data (G  X artner 2003), and graph-based data mining (Washio and Motoda 2003). Blockeel and Se-bag (2003) survey scalability and efficiency issues in MRDM and approaches taken to resolving these. Finally, Page and Craven (2003) survey several applications of MRDM in the area of bioinformatics, the area where MRDM has had most successes so far and which still holds many challenges for MRDM.
 cial issue contains three shorter articles/position statements. While Washio and Motoda (2003) mainly survey methods for frequent subgraph discovery, Holder and Cook (2003) dis-cuss current and future directions in graph-based relational learning, which also addresses other data mining tasks, such as classification. Getoor (2003) introduces and discusses sev-eral tasks of link mining, where links/relations among ob-jects are of central importance. Finally, Domingos (2003) discusses several applications areas for MRDM, as well as challenges that MRDM must address to be successful in these.
 both basic and advanced topics in this area, was organized in Helsinki in August 2002, preceding ECML/PKDD 2002 (The 13th European Conference on Machine Learning and The 6th European Conference on Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases). The slides from this summer school are available online (D X zeroski and  X  Zenko 2002). A report on this event by D X zeroski and  X  Zenko (2003) is included at the end of this special issue.
