 From a mute but eloquent alphabet of 4 characters emerges a complex biological  X  X iterature X  w hose highest expression is human existence. The rapidly advancing technologies of  X  X extgen sequencing X  will soon make it possi ble to inexpensively acquire and store the characters of our complete personal genetic instruction set and make it ava ilable for health assessment and disease management. This uniquely personal form of  X  X ig data X  brings with it challenges that will be discussed in this keynote presentation. Topics will include a brief introduction to the linguistic challenges of  X  X iology as literature X , the impact of personal molecular variation on tr aditional approaches to disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and the challenges of information retrieval when a large volume of primary observations is made that is associated with an evanescent and rapidly changing corpus of scientific interpretation of those primary observations. Experience with extracting high quality pheonotypes from electronic medical records has shown that Natural Language Processing capability is an essential information extraction function for correlation of clinical events with personal genetic variation. Any powerful set of information can be used or misused, and put those who depend upon it in jeopardy. These issues, and a lesson from the long running Jeopardy TV series, will be discussed.
