 Digital technologies are often designed to enhance a sense of social connection between users across physical space. Currently no quantitative scale has been validated to determine how effective a tool is in establishi ng social connection. This proposal outlines 3 studies designed to rigor ously validate a scale of social connection in mediated spaces. To do this, a 24-item scale was developed and tested. In Study 1 the scale was given to 177 people to establish internal a nd convergent validity. Preliminary analyses suggests good overall internal reliability and convergent validity. Future studies intend to establish predictive validity across systems (Study 2) and within a single system (Study 3). The inventory should prove useful for tests of usability and theory. In the last section I describe its role in my dissertation. J.4 [ Computer Applications ]: Social and Behavioral Sciences  X  psychology. Measurement, Design, Experi mentation, Human Factors social connectedness, public awareness, scale validation, internal validity, predictive validity Perception of others in mediated environments has been a focal point of research in HCI and related fields. More specifically, the constructs of  X  X resence X  and  X  X wareness, X  have each received much attention, not least on the topic of measurement [1,4]. A related topic, social connectedne ss, is of growing interest in mobile computing [3], but currently no quantitative measure of social connectedness exists [10]. The benefits of a validated measure of social connectedness are two-fold: First, designers interested in social connection will have a tool that can be compared across systems, and within variations of a system. Also, researchers interested in the psychological and behavioral effects of social connection and social awareness online [5] will have a more rigorous tool for gauging that experience. The validation of a psychological s cale is a multi-step process that typically involves multiple studies. In this series of studies, the first step is to establish internal validity and convergent validity to verify that all of the questions on the scale contribute to measurement of the same concepts, and that these concepts are related to similar concepts on previously validated measures (Study 1). The next step is to demonstrate predictive validity by testing for an expected rela tionship between scores on the measure and specific behaviors or contexts. In this case, connection should vary according to opportunities for social connection in different systems (St udy 2) or across variations of the same system (Study 3). Data from Study 1 has already been collected and is in the early phase of analysis. The scale was developed by consultation with members of the Cornell HCI community, and through exposure to existing scales. It is similar to other psychological scales measuring connectedness [8] and public awareness [7], however it mediated space (e.g.  X  X  feel alone when I am in this space X  ). The 24-item scale was given to 172 participants (  X  = .78). The determine the potential for refining it into fewer questions. As it stands, the current scale demonstr ates convergent validity with the Situational Self-Awareness Scale [7] ( r = .33, p = .00), and the Social Connectedness Scale used in psychotherapeutic research [8], ( r = .47, p = .00). Combined these findings suggest internal and convergent validity. The second step in the validation pr ocess is to establish predictive validity of the scale across different systems. In this study, I will collect data on 40-50 students in four different conditions: low, moderate, and high connectivity sy stems and a control condition. The first system, Pensive , has been developed in the Cornell lab and does not allow for multiple human interaction. The system was designed to enhance self-re flection by sending spontaneous email prompts to users (e.g. What is your favorite childhood memory?). This system should reflect moderate to low social connectedness. The second system, Aurora, does encourage social connection through posts, comment s and messages (see Study 3). The third system, Facebook, is a ve ry rich environment. It has many features that encourage shared information about the self (e.g. photos, demographic info) and allow for user interaction (e.g. chat, wall posts, messages, comments). The control condition The scale was validated offline in two different classes. The final scale will use the phrase  X  X ith this tool X  instead of  X  X n this space. X  The reported analysis are collapsed, as few questions reflected an effect of the room according to a MANOVA. However, final analyses will fully address this factor. will consist of participants answ ering the survey adapted for an empty room. It should generate the least sense of connection. Participants will be assigned to a condition and will use the same system for 2-3 weeks. 2 During those two weeks participants will take the survey 3-7 times, at the beginning, middle and end of the study. The data will be analyzed w ith the intention of establishing that the scale is able to dis tinguish between a sense social connectedness endowed by different systems. The second study will establish pr edictive validity by examining connection in variations of a newly designed mobile device, Aurora . Using this device, the Cornell HCI lab is collaborating with medical professionals at Weil Medical Center to test the effectiveness of enhancing soci al connectedness in groups of cancer patients. The study will include 400-500 people and will be designed to control for exis ting relationships between users (e.g. patient acquaintances/frie nds, family/patient groups, zero-acquaintance groups) and variants in the system (e.g. all connectivity options enabled v. limited options). This may involve 3-6 conditions varying in provisions of connection. The system can be accessed via a mobile phone. It allows users to post a photo or color on a central group webpage which represent the users X  current moods. The system also allows for comments on other X  X  posts, or messages to be sent between users. Participants will use the device for 2-3 weeks, and will receive prompts to complete the survey at multiple intervals during that period. The large sample size will allow for multiple groups within each condition, and a rich multi-level analysis of the data upon completion of the study. As mentioned above, validating a measure of social connectedness will serve both the design community and social science practitioners interested in digital behavior. Though related to existing work on presence and awareness, this tool is less concerned with the sense of mediation [9] per se , but rather the psychological benefit of feeling connected. Designers interested in connection should be able to use this tool across groups, and in within-group tests as technologies change over time. For example, phase 1 of a Connect-o-Widget may provide less social connection th an phase 2. This device is intended to make such test s easy and straightforward. Also, theorists interested in social psychological phenomena should benefit from this tool. Th e study described here is a portion of my dissertation. My larg er dissertation project is on the psychological impact of self-prese ntation on identity construction. I have found that people internalize their online behaviors as part of identity when they perceive that they have an audience [5]. For example, if Carmen is told to act extroverted while answering questions in a blog and Shane is to ld to act extroverted in a text document, afterwards, only Carm en will think of herself as  X  X ctually extroverted. X  In Facebook I will advertise for new users on the Cornell Facebook network. Right now I am exploring how this phenomena not only occurs online, but is particularly intens ified online [7]. Thus, there may be something unique about the psychological effect of experiencing others online. This would not be surprising given that, unlike the  X  X eal world, X  online audiences are often very large and anonymous. In my research, development of a validated psychological measure of social connection for mediated spaces may help explain the influence of others on identity. Given that many behaviors are influenced by awar eness and connection to others [2], this survey may prove useful in addressing additional social science questions in digital space as well. I would like to thank Geri Gay, Dan Cosley, and the Cornell HCI lab for financial and intellectual support on this work to date. [1] Biocca, F., Harms, C., Burgoon, J.K. (2003).
