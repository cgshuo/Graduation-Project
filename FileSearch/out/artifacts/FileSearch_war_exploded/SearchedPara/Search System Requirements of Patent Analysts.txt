 Patent search tasks are difficult and challenging, often re-quiring expert patent analysts to spend hours, even days, sourcing relevant information. To aid them in this pro-cess, analysts use Information Retrieval systems and tools to cope with their retrieval tasks. With the growing interest in patent search, it is important to determine their require-ments and expectations of the tools and systems that they employ. In this poster, we report a subset of the findings of a survey of patent analysts conducted to elicit their search requirements.

With new initiatives providing patent test collections and a spate of workshops and symposiums on patent retrieval 1 there has been renewed interest in researching and develop-ing Information Retrieval (IR) tools, techniques and theory for patent search. Patent analysts perform a number of diffi-cult and challenging search tasks (such as Novelty search or Infringement search) [2] and rely upon sophisticated search functionality, tools, and specialised products [1]. These search tasks are often performed under stringent conditions (esp. regulatory and legal requirements) [2], and they also require different search strategies to achieve the end goal (which in some cases means not actually finding documents, i.e. no  X  X ill X  document, for instance) [3]. Whilst there has been sub-stantial research on patent search and the tasks and tools involved, little work has been performed investigating the requirements of patent searchers, and what they want. It is vital that users are consulted and their needs understood. This is to ensure that the ongoing research and develop-ment meets their current requirements, identifies new re-quirements, highlights areas of potential opportunity (i.e. what advancements are needed to improve patent search techniques) and identifies constraints. To this aim, we sur-veyed over eighty patent analysts in order to obtain a better picture of their search habits, preferences, and the types of functionality that they want/need, along with how they go about accomplishing their search tasks. In this poster paper, we present a subset of the findings from this survey, where we focus on reporting the results about the search tasks and the functionality that patent searchers desire and require.
The survey instrument 2 that we used consisted of an on-line questionnaire with 86 questions consisting of four parts: (i) demographics and expertise (ii) search tasks (iii) search functionality and (iv) open ended questions on search system requirements. The survey was designed to be completed in approximately 30 minutes.

To obtain a large and representative sample we sent the survey instrument out to two patent user group mailing lists: (i) the Confederacy of European Patent Information User Groups (CEPIUG) and (ii) the international Patent Infor-mation Users Group (PIUG). In total, these lists have over 700 members from over 27 different countries, and of these members, approximately 300 are patent information profes-sional who regularly perform patent searching. We received 81 responses in total to the survey  X  a response rate of just over 10% overall. Of the 81 respondents, 58% were male, while 42% were female. Respondents were from 14 differ-ent countries including France, Netherlands, UK, US, other european countries and China. The majority were aged be-tween 39-52 (44%) and had about 10 years experience in patent searching. Almost all respondents primarily searched in English (98%), with a few also using German, French and Dutch (less than 15% in total).

In this poster, we report only on a subset of questions regarding search task frequency and querying functionality requirements. These represent the current demands and re-quirements that analysts have when using an IR system. It is important to appreciate these needs to ensure that re-search is relevant and targeted to meet them. Firstly, it should be noted that respondents spend approximately 17 hours searching (i.e. searching takes place over several days), and they submit about 27 queries per search task on aver-age. The amount of time they spent formulating queries was about 18 minutes per query. This shows that analysts are willing to spend a lot of time and effort searching and formulating their needs. Table 1 presents the results from a series of questions regarding how often an analyst per-forms the different types of search tasks (a description of the different search tasks is provided in the table, see [2] for more details). The category headings are: often (daily or weekly), sometimes (monthly), and rarely (once or twice a year, or never) and the value is the percentage of respon-dents. The results indicate that Novelty, Patentability and Freedom To Operate searches are the most frequent types of search tasks which are routinely performed, given our re-spondents. It is notable that these tasks require the analyst to search both patents and non-patents collections. By con-trast, Infringement, Opposition and Due Diligence search tasks were rarely or never performed by 55-69% of the re-spondents. These findings suggest that a lot of effort is focused on ensuring that infringements or challenges are not made by ensuring that patent applications are novel and patentable while products are appropriately licensed.
For any given search task they perform, analysts were asked about the importance of a variety of operations they use when querying the retrieval system. Table 2 presents a summary of these results. Participants were asked to rate statements such as  X  X oolean operators are important to for-mulate effective queries X  on a five point scale (Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree). Here, we have compressed the scale to Disagree, Neutral and Agree. The results show that Boolean operators were very important to almost all respondents. Proximity, Truncation, Wildcards and Field Operators were important to most respondents (80-91%), while Expansion and Translation were seen as important by around half the respondents with a large proportion of respondents impar-tial to these features. This may be because they have not used such functionality frequently enough to form an opin-ion, or because such functionality is not required as most respondents searched primarily in English.

Finally, the Weighting of terms in the query obtained a very mixed response; where most respondents are impar-tial, while the rest were split between important and not important. This may be because of the difficulties associ-ated with weighting query terms manually. It appears that the features that introduce some uncertainty in the process (i.e. Weighting, Expansion and Translation) are not consid-ered to be as important as the other very precise operators, which can be controlled and have a clear interpretation. This is perhaps due to the fact that analysts are often required to fulfil strict and stringent practices given the legal and regulatory requirements [2].

These findings suggest that research and development of models, methods and systems for patent search need to consider the user requirements identified as important. It would appear that patent searchers prefer search function-ality which provides a high degree of control and precision for accomplishing their search tasks, and they are willing to spend a lot of time and effort in constructing requests and examining documents.
 Table 2: Survey Questions: is the feature important to formulate effective queries, and responses.
In this poster, we have provided empirical evidence which suggests that the requirements of patent analysts are quite different from those assumed in standard retrieval tasks (like web search, etc). In particular, our results indicate a strong preference towards functionality that gives fine grained con-trol over the search process using operators with a clear se-mantic and precise interpretation. These findings motivate further research into understanding more deeply the impor-tance of each type of functionality given the different patent search tasks along with ascertaining a better understanding of the context in which patent search is undertaken, in order to meet searcher needs and requirements.
