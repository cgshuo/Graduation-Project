 Recently, with the explosive spread of blogs, users can express their private ideas or recognized widely; however, the information in blogs contains a mixture of wheat and chaff. Therefore, identifying reliable inform ation efficiently has become an important and analyze them. We have been studying the automatic identification of authoritative blogs in the blogosphere. information, such as the PageRank algorithm used by Google [1]. However, the engines. 
To solve this problem, we focus on the author X  X  sentiment about a linked blog. We author describes their sentiments about a cited blog, as shown in Figure 1 (which we However, we identify cited blog A as more authoritative using link polarity. 
In this paper, we automatically extract the citing areas in a blog entry, and classify useful for identifying authoritative blogs in the blogosphere efficiently, because blogs that are linked positively from many other blogs are considered more reliable. work. Section 3 explains our methods for cla ssifying link polarity. To investigate the effectiveness of our methods, we conducted some experiments, and Section 4 reports the experimental results. We present conclusions in Section 5.
 sentiment analysis, and classification using citing area. 2.1 Sentiment Analysis sentiment for a search query as positive, negative or other, using a sentiment analysis search term, the system extracts and classifies the sentiment for  X  X Phone X  as a polarity for the commercial product. reviews [3, 4]. Turney applied an unsupervised learning technique based on polar words, used uni-gram and bi-gram as features for machine learning. sentiment of a cited blog. 2.2 Lexicon for Sentiment Analysis For sentiment analysis, researchers use a lexicon that contains polar phrases and their Japanese HTML documents [5]. We call the lexicon the sent lexicon. The sent lexicon contains approximately 10,000 Japanese polar phrases with their polarity values. The transferred into their original form with Juman 1 software for morphological analysis. either  X  X  X  X  X  X  or  X  X  X  X  X  , which translate to the same word. When blog authors mention the link, they sometimes use  X  X  X  X  ( X  X ecommend X ) and  X  X  ( X  X eference X ). this lexicon the link lexicon. 2.3 Classification of Link Polarity links to determine the polarity. The link polarity was calculated as follows. negatively oriented words. We manually cr eated rules for the automatic extraction of Martineau proposed a machine-learning approach for link classification from several viewpoints using words that appear in the context of citations of URLs as features [7]. 
Several researchers focused on links in a social net [8, 9]. Guha and Kumar studied negative links in data sets using a method based on machine learning, and compared number of links as a feature for machine learning. In this paper, we focus on links in the link. 
In a research paper, there are passages where the author describes the essence of a citing paper and the differences between the current paper and the cited paper (we call categories. manually created rules using cue phrases for the automatic extraction of citing areas. the citing areas. 
In this paper, we automatically extract citing areas in the same way as Nanba et al . approach for classification of link polarity in blog entries in Subsection 3.2. 3.1 Link Polarity Authors of blogs often link to other blogs with a sentiment for a linked blog. We call categories: positive, negative and other. However, there were only five negative links positive, we classify link polarities in this paper as either positive or other. 3.2 Classification of Link Polarity The procedure for the classification of link polarity is as follows. 1. Input a blog entry. 3. Classify the link by taking account of the information in the citing area. In the following, we will explain Steps 2 and 3. Extraction of Citing Areas. We manually created rules for the automatic extraction HTML anchor types and classify the anchor into the following three categories.  X  Anchor type 1: Anchor is a URL of linked blog.  X  Anchor type 2: Anchor contains blog author X  X  name of linked blog.  X  Anchor type 3: Other than anchor types 1 and 2. We manually created rules 1, 2, and 3, for Anchor types 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  X  Rule 1 for anchor type 1  X  Rule 2 for anchor type 2  X  Rule 3 for anchor type 3 Building the Link Lexicon for Cla ssification of Link Polarity. We build a lexicon procedure for building the link lexicon is as follows. 
First, we collect sentences containing the word  X  X his blog X  (  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ) as candidates positively oriented words. We extract positively oriented words, such as  X  X ecommended X  ( words. To investigate the effectiveness of our methods, we conducted several experiments. 4.1 Data Sets and Experimental Setting We randomly selected 840 links in blog entries, manually classified the link polarity, other links. We used precision, recall and F-measure as evaluation measures. classification of link polarity and extraction of citing areas. Thus, we considered and by our method. 4.2 Evaluation of the Link Lexicon areas manually. There are two main methods. [Methods based on Kale et al.  X  X  words]  X  Kale_LinkLex (our method): Use the link lexicon. [Methods based on Martineau X  X  method] 
We used the TinySVM (http://chasen.org/~taku/software/TinySVM/) software as the machine-learning package. We performed a four-fold cross-validation test.  X  Martineau_LinkLex (our method): Use the link lexicon as features.  X  Martineau_SentLex (our method): Use the sent lexicon as features.  X  Martineau_Base: Use the words as features. Results and Discussion recall in comparison with the baseline method based on polar words. Finally, Martineau_LinkLex obtained a high precision and recall in comparison with the addition, Kale_LinkLex obtained the best performance. Methods based on Kale et al . X  X  method Methods based on Martineau X  X  method 
The performances of methods based on Kale X  X  method were better than the performances of methods based on machine learning. When blog authors introduce a linked blog, they use particular words, such as  X  X ecommended X  (  X  X  X  X  X  ) and Table 4. There are many differences in the incorrect number between Kale_LinkLex classification. method depending on polar words. We describe these errors as follows. (1) Lack of cues required.
 (2) Limitation of the method depending on polar words Our method mistakenly classified the following example as positive. We proposed the said that the present was nice. However, the blog author did not say the linked blog is nice. Our method cannot analyze what is nice. To improve the performance of classification of link polarity, we need to consider language structure.

Kale_LinkLex used blog data A with manual extraction of citing areas. The result of Kale_LinkLex is from Table 3. Kale_LinkLex_Auto shows the same precision and recall as Kale_LinkLex. citing areas. In this paper, we proposed the method for extraction of citing areas using cues. In our future work, we will consider linguistic information from the linked site citing areas.

Kale_LinkLex precision and recall scores of 85.2% and 90.3%. Martineau_LinkLex obtained Kale_LinkLex_Auto shows the same precision and recall as Kale_LinkLex with effectiveness of our methods.
