 a 120 * 120 px screen size mobile phones . pages. Take Fig.1 for example  X  this is a Web page from www.java.net[9]. This page is design-ed for 1024*768 px . The page is divided into many block s. For example: C0 on the center of the Web page is the content block which contains CC0, CL0 and CR0. Maybe only a few block s of the page will be shown in low-resolution terminals. 
In this research, the page will be displayed on various terminals with various resolutions. The screen size is saved by displaying layout view , which contains the views and the topic of each original page block . When the visitors with low-resolution terminals visit the page, its layout view is shown first, then visitors can link to the any block of the page by clicking the corresponding links in layout view . 3.1 Problem Definition dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents[11]. HTML document will convert into DOM after being parsed[4], which names HtmlDOM and corresponds to a set named P . Definition 2 (Block and block set). Web page can be divided into different zones, each of which is called a block . If the Web page P can be divided into n block s, the block s construct a block set B : such as Fig.2. Here the function T is such operation as: as follows. topic b is the topic of block b : view . Let L represent the layout view set: 3.2 Layout Generation [10], to create HtmlDOM from a Web page. Otherwise, the pruning algorithm executes the following operations: 1) Moving the text content of the node to its parent node, and 2) Moving its sub-nodes to a higher level as its brother nodes, and 3) Deleting the current node. necessary to reconstruct the pruned HtmlDOM to a hierarchy-tree . 3.3 Topic Generation finding topic and another one is extracting topic. displaying bigger than c j . ( f ), it means c i displaying the former position than c j . of words in c, and if parameter is content set C ,  X  3.3.1 Finding Topic operation is how to find a exist topic. topic of b is like follows. 
Step 2. If  X  is the max number of words in a topic, then 3.3.2 Extracting Topic mining algorithms. topic
In the algorithm 1, line 1 and 2 is for preprocessing using the stoplist[8] and stemming[7]. tf ( d,t ) at line 6 is the absolute frequency of term t  X  T in document d  X  D , where D is the set of documents and T ={ t 1 , t 2 , ... , t } is set all different terms occurring in D [13]. 3.4 Resolution Adaptation The hierarchy-tree of the page in section 3.1 and 3.2 is used to generate layout views . The lower the resolution is, the deeper the hierarchy-tree is used. Each sub tree that starts from the root node of hierarchy-tree maps to a layout view that provides navigation for a range of resolution. Starting from the top of hierarchy-tree , when the depth is 1, there is only a root node to generate layout view, which means no navigation is required at this resolution. And when the depth is 2, a layout view is generated 3.5 Generating Layout View respectively. problem well. each thread instead of current one-thread-one-memory model to save memory. 60573090, 60503036, 60473073).
