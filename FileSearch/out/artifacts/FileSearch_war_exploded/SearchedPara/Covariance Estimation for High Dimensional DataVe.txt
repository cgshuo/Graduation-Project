 presents a classic dilemma in statistical pattern analysis and machine learning. (SMT) [8, 9]. The SMT is formed by a product of pairwise coordi nate rotations known as Givens tive definite and well-conditioned even when the sample size is limited. for this example, the SMT covariance estimate is consistent ly more accurate. The SMT method be computed with very little computation (i.e.  X  p 2 operations). In the general case, we observe a set of n vectors, y sional. Without loss of generality, we assume y following p  X  n matrix If the vectors y and S is an unbiased estimate of the true covariance matrix with R = E [ y applications, n may be much smaller than p which means that most of the eigenvalues of R are erroneously estimated as zero.
  X  by imposing an L be used to obtain a sparse estimate of the covariance [15]. 2.1 Maximum likelihood covariance estimation R , under the modeling assumption that eigenvectors of R may be represented as a sparse matrix transform (SMT) [8, 9]. To do this, we first decompose R as where E is the orthonormal matrix of eigenvectors and  X  is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then we will estimate the covariance by maximizing the likel ihood of the data Y subject to the the regularizing constraint on the covariance.
 If we assume that the columns of Y are independent and identically distributed Gaussian rand om by The log-likelihood of Y is then given by [7] where R = E  X  E t is specified by the orthonormal eigenvector matrix E and diagonal eigenvalue generalization of FFT and orthonormal wavelet transforms. of

Every Givens rotation E and j where  X ( i 2D rotation, E unstructured, and each butterfly can have an arbitrary rotat ion angle  X  More generally, when K = p transformation [7]. Using the SMT model constraint, the ML estimate of E is given by (11). The greedy minimization approach works by selecting e ach new butterfly E cost, while fixing the previous butterflies, E dure. We start by setting S the following two steps for k = 0 to K  X  1 .
 The resulting values of E  X  by first determining the two coordinates, i It can be shown that this coordinate pair, ( i coordinate pairs [7]. Once i the cost in (12), which is given by where By iterating the (12) and (13) K times, we obtain the constrained ML estimate of E given by The model order, K , can be determined by a simple cross-validation procedure. For example, we E t y can be computed very efficiently by applying the K sparse rotations in sequence. 2.3 SMT Shrinkage Estimator sample covariance. Let  X  R estimate (SMT-S) can be obtained as where the parameter  X  can be computed using cross validation. Notice that So cross validation can be efficiently implemented as in [5]. The effectiveness of the SMT covariance estimation depends on how well the SMT model can cap-SMT covariance estimator to commonly used shrinkage and gra phical lasso estimators. We do this comparison using hyperspectral remotely sensed data as our high dimensional data vectors. that were generated using the measured sample covariance fo r the grass class. for each class, and then computing the sample covariance for the zero mean vectors.
