 BioSumm is a summarization environment that supports user queries on online repositories of scientific publicatio ns by providing abstract descriptions of focused document grou ps. The summarization approach is driven by a grading function which evaluates the occurrences of domain dictionary terms .
The demonstrated system enables users to query and down-load research papers from online databases (e.g., PubMed) and local repositories. The (possibly large) retrieved doc -ument collection is then partitioned into document cluster s devoted to homogeneous topics. Finally, documents in a cluster are summarized by extracting sentences relevant for a specific application domain. In the demo the considered domain is the interaction of human genes and proteins.

In the bioinformatics domain, finding the relationships be-tween genes or proteins related to field topics (e.g., tumor diseases) is an interesting and challenging task. Researche rs studying the interactions between genes and proteins relate d to a disease or a biological process usually explore manually the published literature to find related works that discuss previously published results.

Previous approaches to biological information search (e.g. , iHOP [6], FACTA [11]) typically perform a keyword search in PubMed abstracts to detect the sentences containing the target keywords (e.g., a gene, or a protein). These ap-proaches yield rather heterogeneous search results, becaus e the actual topic (i.e., the context) of the analyzed documents is not considered. Thus, they require the user to further fil-ter a scarcely focused, and possibly large, search result. The purpose of this block is to agglomerate documents cov-ering related topics into homogeneous clusters. The docu-ment collection is represented as a matrix whose rows are the documents represented in the vector space model. Each cell of the vector contains the term frequency in the document as tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) [8]. The Bisecting K-means clustering method [10] is then ap-plied to this representation. However, a different clusteri ng technique may be easily integrated in the framework.
Dictionary evaluator. For each sentence of each paper, the semantic weights, which will bias the grading function of the summarizer, are computed according to the terms in the domain dictionary [5]. In the demo, the provided do-main dictionary contains terms describing human genes and proteins. The terms have been derived from the BioGrid database [9]. By modifying the entries in the domain dictio-nary, the user may customize the summarization for different domains (e.g., the financial domain).

Summarization. For each document cluster, a summary is extracted. The proposed summarization technique pro-vides an ad-hoc multidocument summary based on a tra-ditional statistical single-document summarizer [12], wh ose grading function has been tailored by means of the domain specific information stored in the domain dictionary. More details on the summarization approach, the configuration of the grading function parameters, and the evaluation of the summary quality are available in [5].
 The BioSumm framework is developed in the C++ and Python languages. It provides a visual interface that al-lows the interaction with the system without requiring spe-cific technological competence or expert knowledge of the selected application domain (e.g., biology). In the demonstration we will show the effectiveness of Bio-Summ in supporting the user during the search of relevant documents. The demo will be focused on the biological do-main, in particular on gene and protein knowledge.
The interaction with the BioSumm system occurs through a GUI interface, which is reported in [1] for lack of space. The user may perform the following activities.
