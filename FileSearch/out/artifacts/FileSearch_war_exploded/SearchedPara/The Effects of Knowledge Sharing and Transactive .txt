 This research aims to examine the relationship between KS and TMS can support or limit the individual IWBs, in particular, in Vietnamese HEIs. By investigating the relationship between KSP, TMS and IWB, this research-in-progress study examines how Vietnamese HEIs can foster a KS culture to support their employees X  IWB. This paper will help to validate a research model that presents a join correlation between TMS on KS and IWB in Vietnamese HEIs context. It helps to contribute to Vietnamese knowledge-based development. 
KS provides chances to make the best use of organisation ability to meet market demands and creates solutions that yield competitive advantages for businesses [24, 30]. KS is a difficult concept to define, because it has been examined from multiple perspectives. According to Schwartz [32] KS can be defined as  X  X he exchange of knowledge between and among individuals, and within and among teams, organisational units, and organisations X . It consists of a set of shared understandings associated with facilitating workers acquire applicable information and forming and utilising knowledge networks within teams, groups or organisations [15, 24]. In addition, KS take places at both organisational and individual levels. At the organizational level, KS is to capture, restore, reuse, and transfer experience-based knowledge within a team, a group or the organization. That knowledge, then, can be made available to other businesses in the future. In contrast, at the individual level, KS is to talk to co-workers to support them get something done better or more efficiently. Several studies have shown that KS is vital to organisations because it facilitates them to improve innovation performance [24, 31] and thus, focuses on innovation in organizations has become more necessary in order to be successful in complex organisations [17]. There have been many ways to define innovation to restrict to new methods, ideas, products, processes and organizational applications [9]. Nevertheless, in general, innovation can be examined positively since it is related to the formation of value for both individuals and organisations [26]. Janssen [16] stated that innovation occurs when a person generates, promotes, and implements new ideas or methods which are essential parts of individuals X  IWB. IWB in the workplace consists of three different behavioural tasks: idea generation, idea promotion, and idea realization. This is because innovation processes are generally specified by discontinuous activities [19, 16]. Besides, when individuals sharing their knowledge in a team or group they often face with the major challenges that is the awareness of  X  X ho knows what X  and  X  X ho does what X  [5]. To overcome these challenges, TMS has been proposed as one of the solutions by past study. The sharing of team knowledge has been concentrated mainly by the literature of TMS regarding  X  X ho knows what X  and findings suggest that team performance is positively influenced by the existence of TMS [5, 36]. TMS is explained as a team X  X  shared understanding of and  X  X ho does what X  [5, 6] and  X  X ho knows what X  [5, 36] in the team. Members actively share with and acquire their knowledge, information and resources from others in teams with high TMS quality [4]. In contrast, tasks can be easily divided and members can complete their tasks independently which impede individuals share their knowledge with each other in teams with low TMS quality. An organization can successfully foster the KS environment by both the integration of knowledge into the business plan and adapting the individual perspectives and behaviours in order to encourage willing to KS with each other [23, 24]. Furthermore, several authors examined the relationship between KSP and IWB [2, 28, 37], while some others investigate the relationship between KS and TMS [7, 18]. However, academics and practitioners have not endeavored to advance an integrated model which helps to explore joint effects of KSP, TSM and IWB. Also, many previous studies on IWB have investigated factors which lead to individual IWBs in Western countries, far less attention has been given to the effects of KSP, TMS on IWB in Asia developing countries with many differences of economy, culture and politics [1, 17]. 
To sum up, then, it is an imperative need to take into account the influences of KS and TMS on IWB in order to improve individual IWBs in the context of HEIs in Vietnam. This paper will contribute to the literature of KS by investigating and answering the two main research questions as follows: (1) How does the KSP impact individuals X  IWB in Vietnamese HEIs? (2) What are the joint effects of TMS and KSP on IWB in Vietnamese HEIs? 2.1 Innovative Work Behaviour In this current study, we intend to empirically examine the relationship between KS, TMS and IWB, using a model derived from Janssen [16] in which IWB includes three components: idea creation, idea promotion, and idea application. He identifies IWB as the intentional creation, promotion and application of novel ideas within a team, group or within the organisation that helps to improve the work performance, the group, or the organisation . In the same manner, De Jong and Den Hartog [10] supported this view and stated that IWB is the identification of problems and intended establishment of new and beneficial ideas, as well as a number of behaviours required for developing, launching and implementing novel ideas with the purpose of improving personal and/or business performance [1]. Based on Scott and Bruce [33], Janssen [16] perceived IWB as a complex behavior in the workplace which comprises three behavioural tasks idea creation, idea promotion, and idea application. The first step of the individual innovation is to create idea that is generation of new and valuable ideas in any field [3, 16, 19]. Second, potential colleagues or partners will be promoted the idea which occurs when an individual has created an idea and engages in social activities to get supporter surrounding an idea [16]. Finally, the innovation process involves idea application by developing a model or innovative prototype that is likely to be tried and utilized in teams, groups or the whole organisation [19]. Basic innovations are usually accomplished by individuals, whilst the completion of more complicated innovations often needs teamwork relies upon a diversity of knowledge, ability, and work roles [16, 19]. With the belief that individual IWB have positively effects on work outcomes, several researchers have dedicated increasing attention to factors that potentially foster IWB such as KS, organizational climate and IWB [37], KS and IWB [28], KS determinants, behaviors, and IWB [2], and organizational climate for innovation and organizational performance and IWB [34]. However, the relationship between KSP and IWB is still largely unexamined, especially in non-Western countries [34] in higher education institutions. 2.3 Knowledge-Sharing Process Knowledge is a significant organisational resource that enables the preservation of the valuable heritage, learning techniques, problem-solving techniques and core competencies of organisations; it is important to initiate new useful situations [22]. KS may contribute to enhance competitive advantages for organisations in complex environments, such as the improvement of intellectual capital, by encouraging the exchange and creation of knowledge within an organisation. This is because knowledge is the key factor for achieving continuous innovation at both individual and organisational levels. It is also examined a closely related factor for the progress of any individual or organisation, hence it is an essential indicator to be studied in the KS on individual IWB in HEIs. The has been an identification of the two different types of KS by Van den Hooff and Van Weenen including knowledge-giving and knowledge-receiving that can also be beneficial for an organisation in general, a higher education institution in particular [38]: (1) knowledge-giving and (2) knowledge-receiving . In turn, KS is relied upon knowledge management, which is a necessary activity in all businesses. Any KS practice occurring within organisations between its employees will always be based on both knowledge-giving and knowledge-receiving. Knowledge management is a broader term that caters to a wide range of topics, while KS is a specific focus area of knowledge management [14]. KS, when performed in conjunction with other aspects of the step-by-step process of knowledge management (creation, storage, sharing, and application) can fulfill a strategic necessity for organisations that wish to improve their capabilities and performance [21]. This section briefly reviews relevant literature on different factors affecting KS towards IWB to develop the research model and hypothesis. Firstly, related theories or theoretical models on the effect of KS and TMS towards individual IWB are briefly reviewed. Finally, the paper will discuss about the relevant constructs/factors with the justification of their choices in the current study. The literature available on studies conducted in HEIs is limited. Studies, thus, examined in organisational settings that could provide a theoretical foundation for the research are also cited. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding leads to IWB can be prevented by existing research models in the context of Vietnamese HEIs. 
IWB comprises three dimensions: idea creation, idea promotion, and idea application [16, 33]. It illustrates the process in which employees mutually create, promote and implement new ideas to improve personal and/or business performance. There have been several studies into factors affecting IWB in organisational context. First, Yu et al. [37] examined individual-level KS and innovative behaviour of employees and collaborations between the innovation climate and the individual level of KS within the organisation in the Taiwanese finance and insurance industries. The findings showed that KS and interactive behaviour among workers enhanced innovative behaviour and the ability to innovate and there is a positive association between KS and innovative behaviour. Second, Radaelli et al [28] conducted a study which investigated the new understandings into how workers X  KS impacts their IWB in four healthcare organizations in a European country. The results indicated that (1) workers who donate knowledge also engage more in generating, promoting and applying innovations and (2) the recombination and translation of knowledge integrated in KS has positively impact on IWB. Third, Akhavan et al. [2] examined the influence of socio-psychological factors from different theoretical perspectives, whether it leads to superior employees X  IWB in 22 high-tech companies in Iran. The study specified that individuals X  KS behaviours improve their IWB. Finally, Dong et al. [11] attempted to acquire a new insight into the factors influencing the KS intention in the organisational context in Vietnam. The finding showed that sense of self-worth, subjective norms, and social trust significantly influence attitude towards KS behaviours apart from extrinsic awards and expected associations. The authors suggested that Vietnam has been in a beginning of statge which prepaire itself to lead to a knowledge-based development and there has been little research on emerging economy such as Vietnam. 
Regarding to TMS, Ji et al. [18] conducted a research on communication and TMS influencing KS within a team. The results showed that TMS was the full mediator between personal communication and KS, and positively affected shared mental model. Ariff et al. [5] proposed a model in which TMS quality influence the performance of virtual teams based on the conceptual model of Brandon and Hollingshead. The findings indicated that TMS has a positive effect on virtual teams X  performance. Chen et al. [7] examined the effects of communication quality, TMS, KS, and technical accomplishment of open source software teams. Table 1 presents the summary of the prior research models. The proposed conceptual model consists of three constructs including Knowledge-Sharing Processes (KSP), TMS Quality and Innovative Work Behaviour. Each of these constructs will be described below (Fig. 1). Hypotheses Development  X  Knowledge Sharing Processes and Innovative Work Behaviour 
There is no doubt that the employee X  X  ability of knowledge transformation and utilisation may encourage his or her level of individual innovation, for example rapid problem-solving ability and improved faster response to new challenges. Several academics highlighted the significance of KS to improve individual IWB [2, 28, 37]. Effective knowledge processes can create important organizational intellectual capital and intangible resources to improve performance [25]. For example, when an employee transfers tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge, it will bring advantages to the team, group and/or the entire organization [12]. This shows that when organizations manage their knowledge assets better, the organization will then have a greater chance of better performance in both organizational and individual levels [12, 29]. This research assumes that individual willingness to both giving and receiving knowledge with each other is probably to support IWB and consequently contribute to better completive advantage of the organisation with regard to long-term competitive advantage in complex environments. Therefore, we hypothesize that. 
H1: Individual willingness to share knowledge (donation and collection) positively impact IWB.  X  TMS, Knowledge-Sharing Process and Innovative Work Behaviour 
The definition of TMS is that it is a team X  X  shared understanding of and  X  X ho does what X  [5, 6] and  X  X ho knows what X  [5, 36] in the team. TMS quality is the extent to which team members are able to recognise and utilise the expertise and knowledge of other team members [6]. In teams with high TMS quality, members actively share with and acquire their knowledge, information and resources from others [4]. However, in teams where TMS quality is low, tasks can be easily divided and members can complete their tasks independently which impede individuals share their knowledge with each other. Therefore, it is hypothesized that: 
H2: The higher the TMS quality, the more impact individual willingness to share knowledge (donation and collection) will have on IWB. 
H3: Individual willingness to share knowledge (donation and collection) mediates the relationship between TMS quality and IWB The sequential mixed-methods, including quantitative and qualitative methods, will be used to accomplish the research goal with the sample is academic staff in Vietnamese HEIs. The questionnaires will be conducted in the stage one to collect the data from the study sample about their influencing factors that will then be used in the research framework, based on that the stage two will be undertaken by interviews to validate the quantitative results. Sample and data collection 
A total of 4 universities will be randomly selected from the list of 37 public universities in the north of Vietnam published by the Ministry of Education and Training, Vietnam. The questionnaire with a cover letter will be delivered to and collected from the participants through the administrative staff of the respective departments before being returned in closed envelopes to ensure voluntary participation and the anonymity of the participants. Measures 
In this study, the questionnaire will adapt or adopt existing measures from several past studies. All items used to operationalise constructs will be mainly adapted for examination in the KS context in Vietnam. Items will be measured using a five-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree or 1 = never to 5 = always). KSP will be measured using eight items adapted from an examination by Van den Hooff and Van Weenen [38] which evaluate the extent of individual willingness to both giving and receiving knowledge with colleagues. Quality of TMS will be measured using four items taken from Imran [4] it assesses the extent to which team members are able to recognise and utilise the knowledge and expertise of other team members. IWB will be measured using nine items adapted from Janssen [16], which access the extent to which employees behave to create, promote, and implement new ideas in a group or organization. Data analysis 
We intend to analyse our data in the two phases. For the phase 1 (Quantitative data analysis), a multivariate statistical approach will be implemented to quantitatively analyse data collected from the questionnaires including descriptive data analysis to find if the data is ready to continue to the multivariate data analyses step (participants X  profiles and data screening by studying normality, means, standard deviations and standard error of the mean), measurement scale analysis to capture the meaning of each model construct through an assessment of reliability and validity (Cronbach X  X  alpha) addition to this, item-total correlations will be used to assess the extent to which a particular item belonged to its scale, the validity of the measurement by using Explanatory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis, and Structural Equation Modeling to investigate the causal relationships of the model [13]. We will use the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) (22.0) and Amos 22. For the Phase 2 (Qualitative data analysis), the interpreting data collected from interviews is indispensable to validate the quantitative results. This work has explained the study in progress in considering the roles of KSP and TMS on IWB in the context of HEIs in Vietnam. The significant contributions will yield to both theory and practice. The researchers are able to (1) better understand how KSP facilitate or impede individual IWB, and (2) explore and explain what are the joint effects of TMS and KSP on IWB. The practitioners are able to (1) understand how KS practices can help to encourage or discourage IWB that occurs during the exchange of knowledge between individuals within groups or the organization, and (2) guide managers and leaders in building applicable policies in promoting KS in their organisation in order to improve IWB in Vietnamese HEIs which contributes to knowledge-based development initiatives. 1.
