 Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have emerged as some of the most important platforms for people to dis-cover, report, share, and communicate with others about various public events, be they of global or local interest (some high profile examples include the U.S Presidential debates, the Boston bombings, the hurricane Sandy, etc). The burst of social media reaction can be seen as a valu-able real-time reflection of events as they happen, and can be used for a variety of applications such as computational journalism. Until now, such analysis has been mostly done manually or through primitive tools. Scalable and auto-mated approaches are needed given the massive amounts of both event and reaction information. These approaches must also be able to conduct in-depth analysis of complex interactions between an event and its audience. Support-ing such automation and examination however poses several computational challenges. In recent years, research commu-nities have witnessed a growing interest in tackling these challenges. Furthermore, much recent research has begun to focus on solving more complex event analytics tasks such as post-event effect quantification and event progress pre-diction. This tutorial aims to review and examine current state of the research progress on this emerging topic. Event analysis; Social media
Increasingly rich and large-scale social multimedia data (including text, images, audio, video) are being generated and posted to social media channels. Real-time social media streams have many advantages over the traditional media channels, such as ubiquity, mobility, immediacy, and seam-less communication in reporting, covering and sharing real-world events (e.g, SuperBowl, State of the Union). Given these advantages, social media posts such as tweets can typ-ically reflect events as they happen in real-time. Despite its benefits, social media also tends to be noisy, chaotic, and overwhelming. As a result, the vast amount of noisy social media posts poses tremendous challenges for conducting au-tomated in-depth tweets examination, which is critical to ap-plications for journalistic investigation, playback of events, storytelling, etc.

In this tutorial we will examine the current state-of-the-art in supporting such automation and examination on the crowd X  X  social media posts in the context of the public events that they are in response to. We will begin with an overview of recent technical innovations from the Machine learning, Data mining, Multimedia, Computer Vision and Social com-puting communities in handling several core research tasks  X  namely, detection and extraction of events from social mul-timedia, quantification and prediction of event impact, sens-ing and characterization of user activities, and estimation of user profiles.

Throughout the tutorial, we will discuss about the advan-tages and disadvantages of various approaches. At the end, we will also highlight the current open challenges in handling more complex event analytics tasks using social multimedia data.
Researchers in the field of analysis of user-generated con-tent will benefit the most as this will give them an exhaustive overview of the research in the direction of event analysis us-ing social multimedia data. We believe that the tutorial will give the newcomers a complete picture of the current work, introduce important research topics in this field, and inspire them to learn more. People from industry will benefit from the discussions on a large number of applications where such mechanisms have already been applied.
A summary of the current state of the research progress in computational methods to extract, model, analyze and predict public events using social multimedia data. The in-tent of the tutorial is to provide an overview of the current research and challenges in the area. It will survey and ex-plore the recent advances in Data Mining, Social Comput-ing, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Multimedia communities involving various supervised and unsupervised approaches. Particular attention will be given to examining and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches. In this context, future research directions in event analytics and predictions for events from different do-mains will also be discussed.
