 The growth of the Web and other Big Data sources lead to important performance problems for large-scale and dis-tributed information retrieval systems. The scalability and efficiency of such information retrieval systems have an im-pact on their effectiveness, eventually affecting the experi-ence of their users and monetization as well. The LSDS-IR X 15 workshop will provide space for researchers to discuss the existing performance problems in the context of large-scale and distributed information retrieval systems and de-fine new research directions in the modern Big Data era. The workshop expects to bring together information re-trieval practitioners from the industry, as well as academic researchers concerned with any aspect of large-scale and dis-tributed information retrieval systems.

The scalability and efficiency of large-scale and distributed information retrieval systems are known to have an impact on their effectiveness. Consequently, performance-related issues continue to be important in the context of real-life information retrieval systems. Even within research labora-tory settings, the size of the standard datasets are becoming exceedingly large (e.g., ClueWeb12: 1 billion documents, 27 TB uncompressed), requiring efficient and often distributed architectures to facilitate large-scale experimentation.
Traditionally, web-scale search engines employ large and highly replicated systems, operating on computer clusters in one or few data centers. Coping with the increasing number of user requests and indexable pages requires adding more resources. However, data centers cannot grow indefinitely. Scalability problems in information retrieval have to be ad-dressed in the near future, and new distributed applications are likely to drive the way in which people use the Web. Distributed information retrieval is the point in which these two directions converge.

The LSDS-IR workshop series provides space for re-searchers to discuss the above-mentioned problems and de-fine new directions for the work on large-scale and dis-tributed information retrieval in the modern Big Data era. LSDS-IR plays an important role in the information retrieval community as a venue where early work addressing the work-shop X  X  topics can be discussed and matured. Finally, as the scale and type of data being search continues to grow as part of the modern Big Data era, efficient yet effective retrieval can only become more important in addressing information needs in corpora too large to be structured.

As in the previous years, the LSDS-IR X 15 workshop aims to bring together both information retrieval practitioners from the industry, as well as academic researchers con-cerned with efficient and distributed information retrieval systems. The workshop also welcomes contributions that propose different ways of leveraging diversity and multiplic-ity of resources available in distributed systems. The main goal of the workshop is to attract people from industry and academia to present and discuss ideas, problems, and results in the efficiency of large scale and distributed information retrieval systems. In LSDS-IR X 15, we expect a participation of around 15 people, including two invited speakers.
The LSDS-IR X 15 workshop continues the efforts of the fol-lowing workshops organized in the past:
The recent LSDS-IR workshops hosted several well-known keynote speakers, such as Ricardo Baeza-Yates (Yahoo Labs), Abdur Chowdury (Twitter), K. Selcuk Candan (Ari-zona State University), Aristides Gionis (Aalto University), Marcus Fontoura (Google), Sebastiano Vigna (Universita degli Studi di Milano), Torsten Suel (NYU), and Ching-Yung Lin (IBM TJ Watson).
The topics that are of interest to the workshop are as follows:
The workshop program includes two types of contribu-tions in the ACM double column format: original technical contributions (6 pages) and short position papers (4 pages). Position papers are important for the success of the work-shop as a way of promoting discussions upon controversial and intriguing ideas. Submitted papers undergo a peer re-view process, coordinated by the organizers. Each paper is reviewed by at least three reviewers. The submission and reviewing processes are handled using the EasyChair con-ference management system.
The workshop is structured as a full-day workshop. It will consist of several short and full paper presentations. Each accepted contribution will be presented, allowing ap-proximately 25 minutes for long papers (plus 10 minutes for questions) and 20 minutes for short papers (plus 10 minutes for questions). There will be two invited talks, which will be given by Simon Jonassen (Cxense) and Egemen Tanin (University of Melbourne). The invited talk durations are 45 minutes (plus 15 minutes for questions).
The LSDS-IR X 15 program committee has a good mix of researchers from the academia and the industry:
Ismail Sengor Altingovde recently served as a PC member in SIGIR (2011, 2014 and 2015), WSDM (2013, 2014), ECIR (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015), and CIKM (2013), as well as the previous editions of LSDS-IR in 2010 and 2011, and he co-chaired LSDS-IR in 2013 and 2014. He published papers in prestigious journals, including ACM TODS, TOIS, TWEB, JASIST, IEEE Intelligent Systems, Inf. Syst. and IP&amp;M, as well as top-tier conferences including SIGIR, WWW, and CIKM, mostly on efficiency related topics such as crawling, caching, index pruning and query processing for Web search engines.
 B. Barla Cambazoglu was a co-organizer of the LSDS-IR X 10, LSDS-IR X 11, and LSDS-IR X 14 workshops. He was also the proceedings chair for WSDM X 09 and the poster and proceedings chairs for ECIR X 12. He served as an area chair in SIGIR X 13 and SIGIR X 14. He regularly serves in the program committees of SIGIR, WWW, and KDD conferences. He has papers published in prestigious journals including IEEE TPDS, JPDC, JASIST, ACM TWEB, Inf. Syst., IP&amp;M as well as top-tier conferences including SIGIR, CIKM, WSDM, WWW, and KDD, mainly in the areas of information retrieval and web search.

Nicola Tonellotto is a co-organizer of the LSDS-IR X 13 and LSDS-IR X 14 workshops. Previously, he served as a PC member and reviewer in several HPC and IR conferences. Nicola has published papers on efficiency topics in informa-tion retrieval in prestigious journals and conferences such as ACM TOIS, SIGIR, ECIR, ICTIR, WSDM. Nicola has con-tributed to the development of several open source software packages, such as the Terrier information retrieval platform.
