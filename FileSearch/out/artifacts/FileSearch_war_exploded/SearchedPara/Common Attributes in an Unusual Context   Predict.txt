 Social matching systems recomme nd people to other people. With the widespread adoption of smart phones, mobile social matching systems could potentially tr ansform our social landscape. However, we have a limited und erstanding of what makes a good social match in the mobile context. We present a theoretical framework which outlines how a user's context and the rarity of different affinity measures in vari ous contexts (match rarity) can be used to provide valuable social matches. We suggest that if a user attribute is very rare in a particular context, users will generally be more interested in an affinity match. We conducted a survey study to assess this fra mework with 117 respondents. We found that both context and match rarity significantly influence interest in a social match. These results validate the key aspects of the framework. We discuss the resu lts in terms of implications for social matching system design. H.1.2 User/Machine Systems: Human Factors Design, Human Factors, Theory Mobile social matching, people recommendations, context-aware computing. Social matching systems are recommender systems that help users find other individuals of interest [10]. They support the creation of new social ties by recommending people to people. Applications for such systems include busine ss networking, dating, knowledge management and social networking [6]. Along with the adoption of smartphone s, mobile social computing applications which incorporate social matching features are becoming increasingly popular (e.g., Loopt Mix). Such applications can pot entially increase both the opportunities for and the relevance of social matche s by utilizing information about a user's physical and social context, and history of mobility (geo-temporal social data) [6, 2]. F or example, recommended matches keywords in any textual content asso ciated with the user as well as shared social ties [1]. In addition to the standard attributes like interests, demographics and soci al ties, there is valuable contextual information availabl e on the mobile phone which can be used to make inferences a bout user X  X  local context, for example, involvement in an activity based on location, Tony is at the gym so he is probably working out (e.g., at the gym, must be working out) [3, 6, 9]. Short-term and long-term trajectories, location logs, and geotemporal patte rns may also be used to infer user X  X  interests from a user X  X  fre quently visited places. Therefore, mobility traces have been used by [2, 5, 9] to identify potential matches. Proximity pa tterns can be used to identify people who are nearby each other often but do not know each other yet [6]. We list various user attributes which can be used to measure affinities between users in Table 1. Some of the most well known examples of social matching systems are those employed by online dating sites such as, eHarmony.com, OkCupid.com, and Match.com. These sites employ systems of various levels of sophistication; however, they all follow the same basic design of collecting user data and then generating match scores from that data. Facebook X  X   X  X eople you may know X  [4] slightly alters this design by using social tie data for generating matches. Mobile social matching extends so cial matching to mobile devices by recommending people to people based on their current local context. Previous research on mobile social matching includes SocialNet [9] which matches us ers based on location and also looks for mutual acquaintances for introduction. Commercial mobile applications such as Lo opt Mix, Foursquare X  X  Gatsby, and AreYouInterested, leverage social network and location data to provide match recommendati ons. However, there is little evidence to suggest that particularly relevant matches are produced by simply adding information about proximity or location histories into interest-based affinities calc ulations. Clearly, a more nuanced understanding of how a user's loca l context can be utilized to generate relevant matches is required. To address the need for a more holistic understanding of the relationship between a user's lo cal context and match relevance we developed the following theoretical framework. It distinguishes between two different types of data that can be used to model affinities: 1) sh ared user attributes like interests, needs or personal background; and 2) match moderators, which help to assess if a computed affinity s hould be considered a relevant match in a particular situation (Figure 2). Previous research and recommendation systems assume that individuals want to be matched with people who are the most like themselves [8, 1]. Therefore, curr ent social matching systems use the similarity between two users to predict the desirability of the H1: General rarity of a shared user attribute will be positively associated with an individual X  X  interest in a match. H2: Contextual rarity of a shared user attribute will be positively associated with an individual X  X  interest in a match. We conducted a personalized self-re ported web survey to evaluate our social matching framework. The subjects were students, staf f and faculty of a medium sized urban university ranging from 18 to 54 years old. The subjects were invited via email to take the online survey. The survey which took an average of 25 minutes to complete contained seven sections, each one for a different affinity type from Table 1 (interests, need s, geographical background, educational background, distinct characteristics, places and friends). For each section responde nts were instructed to enter three of their own user attributes. Then, for each attribute and the combination of all three in this section, they were asked two sets of questions: First, we asked them to rate (on a scale of 1-very rare to 7-very common) the commonness of the attribute in a) their main social circle, b) when they go out socially, c) at their work or school, and d) in the ar ea they live. Second, we asked them about their level of interest in a potential match with same user attribute in each of the following four situations a) on their computer, where the person lives/wor ks in their geographical area or regularly visits it, b) on their phone, where this person is currently nearby while they are at an event, place or activity related to this user at tribute c) on their phone where this person is currently nearby while they are on campus and d) on their phone where this person is currently nearby while they are in Japan for a business trip. One of the reasons these contexts were chosen was to measure match interest when at home in front of a computer (a) compared to when on the go and using a mobile phone (b-d). In context b), it is expected that the user attribute is very common because many people with the same attribute can be found at a related event, place, or activity. Context c) probes a context that is expected to be very common for university stude nts, faculty and staff. Being in Japan (d) is expected to be a relatively uncommon context because we assumed a majority of respondents do not frequently visit Japan. A note in the survey asked Japanese respondents to assume they are in Italy instea d of in Japan. Respondents could specify their level of interest by choosing 1) not interested, 2) interested in a notification or 3) interested in a notification and to be introduced as shown in Figure 3. At the end, respondents were aske d to give an overall rating (7 point Likert scale) on how interest ed each of the seven sections was for them in terms of receiving social match recommendations based on these attributes. A total of 117 individuals attempte d to complete the survey. Of these 89 were complete and used in the results presented here. Table 2 summarizes how respondents X  rated their overall interest in each of the different attribute types as a basis for a mobile social match. Respondent s were most interested in social matches based on shared interests, mutual friends, and needs. In contrast, usual context (e.g., at a rela ted event, at work/school). We compared the context (at school versus in Japan) and the level of interest in a potential match (not interested, interested in notification, and interested in notification plus introduction) for educational background attributes rated  X  X ery common X  when at school. This is summarized in Table 4. Table 3. Summary statistics for mean commonness depending A Chi-squared test found signifi cant differences for the two contexts  X  2 (2, N=116)=6.813, p=0.033. When comparing not interested versus notification plus introduction we found a significant difference  X  2 (1, n=96) = 6.575, p=0.010. With interest in a match associated with a shared common attribute increasing in a contextually rare situation. The results of respondents X  intere st to being matched on different attributes show that matches ba sed on similar places were the least interesting to respondents. This is an interesting finding because many of the commercial mobile social matching systems focus on matching based on location. Our first hypothesis H1 (general rarity of a shared user attribute will be positively associated with an individual X  X  interest in a match) was supported. Additionally, four out of seven attribute types X  when individually examined were significantly different as well, with respondents being more interested in matches with mutually uncommon attributes. In other words, the rarer an attribute the more desirable a match based on that attribute is.
