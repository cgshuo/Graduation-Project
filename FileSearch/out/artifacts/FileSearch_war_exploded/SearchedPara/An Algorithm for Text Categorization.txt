 A novel and efficient learning algorithm is proposed for the binary linear classification problem. The algorithm is trained using the Rocchio X  X  relevance feedback technique and builds a classifier by the intermediate hyperplane of two common tangent hyperplanes for the given category and its comple-ment. Experimental results presented are very encouraging and justify the need for further research.

Rocchio X  X  relevance feedback technique[1, 2] is a query modification process that has been extensively investigated in the literature and used in information retrieval. Relevance feedback improves the query with terms that are considered relevant to the information seek. This is done iteratively ei-ther manually or automatically by selecting a predefined set of the top retrieved documents as relevant (pseudo-relevance feedback).

The aim is to find the optimum query, that is the query that maximizes the similarity with relevant documents while minimizing similarity with non-relevant documents. If R ( is the set of relevant(non-relevant) documents, then we wish to find, Q opt , such that: where sim ( q, R ) denotes the similarity of the query to the set of relevant documents. Using as similarity measure the cosine formula, we get that: that is, the optimum query is a vector defined by the differ-ence of the centroids of the relevant and non-relevant doc-uments, as it is shown in Figure 1a. In other words Q opt defines a hyperplane, h : sets, R and  X  R , for an appropriate value of  X  . Figure 1: Vector C R  X  C  X  R is not always the Optimum This is not, however, always the case as it is shown in Figure 1b, where the query defined by equation (2) is not optimum although the sets R ,  X  R are linearly separable and as a consequense there is a hyperplane that separates them.
Algorithmically the relevance feedback process has been implemented by updating the query iteratively according to the following equation: for a given initial query vector,  X  ,  X  are control parameters defined empirically. From (3) follows the conjecture that the optimal query is, in general, a linear combination of the relevant and non-relevant docu-ments. In the following we shall use the Rocchio X  X  feedback technique in constructing a classifier for a pair of linearly defined in (2), which is improved iteratively applying rele-vance feedback on the misclassified examples (Figure 1b). In the next section we describe the algorithm in more detail.
The algorithm constructs two common tangent hyperplanes the classifier is determined by the intermediate hyperplane of those tangent hyperplanes. If the two tangent hyperplanes are the classifier is Figure 2: Rotation of hyperplane h (0) towards the misclassified examples
Initialization of the algorithm:
The hyperplane defined by h (0) :  X  = s p = tor recall = 1). By construction all the relevant documents lie on the same side of h , the one pointed by the vector it happens all the non-relevant examples to lie on the other side of h ,then h is a separating hyperplane and the algo-rithm stops. This is not generally the case, as it is shown in Figure 2, where the hyperplane h (0) , defined by the above process, intersects the set of non-relevant documents and the examples in the gray area are misclassified. In this case we rotate the hyperplane h (0) towards the misclassified exam-ples ( NA set, set of Negative Accepted examples) until all the negative examples lie on the same side of the hyperplane.
Rotation of h (0) towards the misclassified exam-ples: This rotation is performed stepwise. At each step we determine the misclassified, NA , examples by h 1 ,con-struct their centroid vector, perplane towards the misclassified examples until it passes from the centroid of moving  X   X   X   X  W the points the value of  X  : This rotation however may cause examples in the set R to be misclassified ( PR set, set of Positive Rejected examples). Thus we repeat the process on the set R by moving Table 1: Performance results of the Proposed Algo-rithm, SVM and Generalized Centroid.

R ))  X  the same way we determine  X  ,by: This alternation of the rotation towards either the NA or the PR continues until | NA | = | PR | = 0 or the number of iteration exceeds a predetermined value. This process converges to a common tangent hyperplane that leaves the sets R and  X  R on opposite sides. In the same way we built a second common tangent and then we take as classifier their intermediate hyperplane.
For evaluation of the performance, scalability and robust-ness of the algorithm, five main corpuses were used; namely the Reuters-21578 corpus, the Reuters-RCV1 corpus, the OHSUMED corpus, the TREC-AP corpus and the 20 News-group corpus. From these corpuses, we have constructed various subsets in order to explore the behavior of the al-gorithm under different synthesis and size of both the train and the testing set. These files have been constructed on a preprocessing step, applying stopword removal and stem-ming. The results are presented in Table 1 together with results obtained by SVM, a state of art classification algo-rithm. These results are very encouraging and justify the need for further research.
