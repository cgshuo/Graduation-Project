 Bioinformatics provides opportunities for developing novel data mining methods. Some of the grand challenges in bioinformatics include protein structure prediction, homol-ogy search, multiple alignment and phylogeny construction, genomic sequence analysis, gene finding and gene mapping, as well as applications in gene expression data analysis, drug discovery in pharmaceutical industry, etc. Follow-ing the greatly successful 1st BIOKDD Workshop [1], the 2nd BIOKDD Workshop on Data Mining in Bioinformatics was held in July 2002, at Edmonton, Canada, in conjunc-tion with 8th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.
 The workshop aimed to present latest results in this im-portant area at the intersection of biology and KDD. The workshop proceedings contained 10 papers (out of 16 sub-missions) that were accepted for presentation at the work-shop. Each paper was reviewed by two or three members of the program committee. Along with one invited speaker, we were able to assemble a very exciting program. A brief overview of the invited talk and contributed papers appears below.
 Online proceedings of both the BIOKDD workshops are ac-cessible at: A book entitled,  X  X ata Mining in Bioinformatics, X  co-edited by Jason Wang, Mohammed Zaki, Hannu Toivonen and Dennis Shasha, will be published in late 2003 by Springer-Verlag London Ltd. The book will be based on selected papers from the previous BIOKDD workshops and several SIGKDD Explorations. Volume 4, Issue 2 -page 112 ( Mining Protein Contact Maps ). Contact maps are binary matrices that note the contact/non-contact between all pairs of amino acids in a protein. They focused on two prob-lems: to discover the frequent 2D patterns of contacts/non-contacts that occur in real proteins, and to cluster the mined patterns into distinct groups. They discussed how the mined clusters can help in improving the prediction of contact maps for proteins whose structure is not known.
 In the next paper, Mukund Deshpande, Michihiro Ku-ramochi, and George Karypis (University of Minnesota), describe feature mining techniques for classifying structures ( Automated Approaches for Classifying Structures ). They propose an approach that first mines discriminating sub-structures for different classes, and then uses them as fea-tures for classifiers. They applied the approach to a chemical compound dataset.
 In the third paper, Li Liao, Jean-Francois Tomb (DuPont Experimental Station), Sen Zhang, and Jason Wang (New Jersey Institute of Technology), present some preliminary results on classifying and clustering tasks in metabolic pathway analysis ( Clustering and Classifying Enzymes in Metabolic Pathways: Some Preliminary Results ). They ob-served that pathways co-occurring in many organisms tend to have common enzymes; they propose new tree matching techniques for clustering the pathways and classifying the enzymes.
 In the last paper of the session, Steven Eschrich, Nitesh Chawla, and Larry Hall (University of South Florida), de-velop generalization techniques for mining protein structure data and high throughput drug discovery data ( Generaliza-tion Methods in Bioinformatics ). They show that an en-semble classifier, combining classifiers on small subsamples, can yield better results than a single classifier on the entire dataset. They show the effectiveness of the proposed ap-proaches on the KDDCup 2001 drug discovery dataset, and on protein secondary structure prediction data. In the first paper of the session, George Forman (Hewlett-Packard Labs) proposed active, incremental classifier learn-ing for problems where the goal is to identify positive cases with minimal cost ( Incremental Machine Learning to Reduce Biochemistry Lab Costs in the Search for Drug Discovery ). At each step, a classifier is trained with the known examples. It is then used to select the most likely positive example from the unknown ones, to be analyzed chemically and added to the set of known examples. Experimental results with 2001 KDD Cup data demonstrate the power of the approach. In the next paper, Huma Lodhi and Yike Guo (Imperial Col-lege, University of London) addressed structure activity rela-tionship analysis ( Gram-Schmidt Kernels Applied to Struc-ture Activity Analysis for Drug Design ). They apply Gram-Schmidt kernel and support vector machines to predict the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by pyrimidines or by triazines. Their experimental results show great promise. In the last paper of the session, John L. Pfaltz and Christo-pher M. Taylor (University of Virginia) used closed sets to discover deterministic relationships, with applications in bi-ological data ( Closed Set Mining of Biological Data ). The main contribution is an algorithm that incrementally cre-ates the closure lattice, so the results are applicable widely outside biology, too. SIGKDD Explorations.
