 1 ,wehave We first observe that Using the above relations, we have D HS ( U, V | W )= Proof. We will first prove the convergence of V ( m ) YX  X  V YX HS . It is easy to see that From Lemma 3 (in the supplementary material), we know consider the second term, we get Assuming m  X  1 and m  X  1 ,wehave Using the above inequality, it is easy to see that, The last step is obtained by finiteness of Proof. We have, The first term can be bounded using Theorem 3 . The second term can be upper bounded by Using the fact that V ( m ) YZ HS  X  1 and Theorem 3 ,wehave D HS ( X, Y ) has a very simple form: uniform convergence rate for estimating p 2 ( x ) dx can be arbitrarily slow (Theorem 11 ). dimensional case, this is X p 2 ( x ) dx .
 a specific way. The distribution of the random density p  X  P 0 n is denoted by  X  n ( p ). probabilities we will have 1+1+3 a n is close to 1/2. From this it follows that and thus P [ |  X  n  X  p 2 | &gt;a n ]  X  n dP  X  1 / 2, which will prove that distributions can be kept uniform.
 Proof. In order to prove the consistency of the D C ( X, Y ), we need to show V ( m ) the decomposition, From Theorem 3 , it is easy to see that the second term and it converges with O p (  X  3 / 2 m m  X  1 / 2 + 1 / 4 m ). Now consider the first term, This can be upper bounded by the following: The first term ( 8 ) in the above expression can be rewritten as Using the facts  X  ( m ) and Lemma 4 , the above term can be upper bounded by We similarly bound the third term ( 10 ). Again using the fact  X  ( m ) Let us prove the following lemma which will be useful in completing the proof. Lemma 1. Suppose kernels k X ,k Y and k Z are bounded and Lipschitz continuous, then  X  ( m ) and its convergence rate is O p ( m  X  1 / 2 ) .
 Proof. We have m This can be upper bounded by using the following: Observe that each i = { 1 ,...,m } ,wehave we know for some constant B . Moreover, the term is easy to see that the expression ( 11 ) can bounded by similar analysis, we can show that the second term is O p ( m  X  1 / 2 ). of the estimators is bounded by 1.
 case when D C ( S 1 ,...,S n ) = 0. Then each term since they are non-negative. By product rule of probability 2005 ; 2008 ; Ritov &amp; Bickel , 1990 ) for details on these results). Theorem 10. (i) If the product k X k Y is a universal kernel on X  X  Y , then we have (ii) If the product k X k Y is a universal kernel on ( X  X  Z )  X  Y and k Z is universal, then F X and F X be e copula and empirical copula as defined above. Then, for any  X  0 , Lemma 3. Suppose V YX is Hilbert-Schmidt and m  X  0 as m  X  X  X  . Then we have Housing Dataset
