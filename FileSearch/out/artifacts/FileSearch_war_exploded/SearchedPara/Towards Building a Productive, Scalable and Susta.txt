 This paper reports on a case study of a Health Open Educational Resources (OER) project in order to examine how to facilitate cross-institutional collaboration for OER production. This study assesses collaboration needs, identifies social and technical barriers, and builds a collaboration model to facilitate OER production. In doing so, we make three contributions to the GROUP community: (1) Whereas prev ious studies on distributed collaboration tend to focus on we ll-developed collaboration, in this study we research collaboration in Health OER at an early stage of development; (2) By studying collaboration involving both developing and developed c ountries, we identify components that are particularly critical for collaboration between teams spanning differently resourced nati ons; (3) By studying the Health OER project, we better understand fa ctors that affect distributed collaboration when participants are not externally funded and are constrained by their local organizations. K.4.3 [ Organizational Impacts ]: Computer-Supported Collaborative Work; K.6.1 [Proje ct and People Management]: Systems Analysis and Design Design, Human Factors Distributed collaboration, Open Educational Resources (OER), collaboration readiness, technology readiness, collaboration between differently resourced nations Information and communicati on technologies (ICT) have reshaped knowledge access and education. In recent years, one of the most prominent influences of ICT on education has been Open Educational Resources (OER) [3]. By 2007, there were over 2500 open courses published by over 200 universities. OER is defined as  X  X igitized materials offered freely and openly for educators, students and self-learners to use and reuse for teaching, learning and research X  [26]. OER includes learning resources such as courseware, content modules, lear ning objects, learning support and assessment tools; resources to support instructors to create and adapt OER; and resources to assure the quality of education and educational practices [25]. In particular, OER holds the promise to promote access to knowledge and educational opportunities by learners from developing countries [1]. The first generation of OER adopted a broadcast model, publishing OER content to the world over the web. The leading example is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology X  X  OpenCourseware (OCW). MIT X  X  OCW is an institutionally organized repository that primar ily publishes static HTML and PDF versions of course Powe rPoints, syllabi, and other curricular materials prepared by MIT X  X  faculty. Although the broadcast model makes it easy to control the quality of OER, it excludes collaborative contributions from ot her institutions [26]. With the advent of Web 2.0 tools such as wikis, social networking platforms, and other technol ogies, collaboration between distributed instructors on OER content creation and use will become easier. This increased collaboration ability will integrate distributed knowledge and provide materials that meet the needs of learners worldwide. Desp ite OER X  X  rapid development, however, little is known about how to facilita te instructors to collaborate at distance to create OER. Previous research in Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) has studied other purposeful, distributed knowledge creation systems such as distributed scientific collaborations [6,20], open source development [19,14], online communities [11] and Wikipedia. This research shed light on how voluntary contributors achieve effective collaboration across space, time, and organizational boundaries th rough implicit or explicit coordination and governance. Ho wever, contributors to OER differ from other distributed knowledge creation systems in various ways. While self-selected participants in open source development, virtual communities, and Wikipedia are familiar with technologies that facilitate their contribution, many educators who wish to produce OER are not . Many of the potential OER contributors are from developing countries, where there is only intermittent Internet access. Fu rthermore, OER contributors are often instructors who are constraine d by their institutional policies related to copyright ownership, reward and recognition, release time, and other issues di scussed further below. We conducted a case study of a Health OER project to examine how to facilitate cross-institutional collaboration for OER production. This study aims to (1) assess needs for cross-institutional collaboration for OER production; (2) identify social and technical barriers to collaboration; and (3) build a productive, sustainable, and scalable colla boration model for OER production. In doing so, we make three contributions to the GROUP community: (1) Whereas previ ous studies on distributed collaboration tend to focus on we ll-developed collaboration, in this study, we research collaboration in Health OER at an early stage of development. Identifying early factors that affect the success of distributed collaboration lays the foundation for successful future collaboratio n and community building; (2) Previous studies on distributed collaboration focus on collaborations within developed c ountries and thus do not address issues particular to collaboration between differently resourced nations, such as resource disparity and power differentials. By studying collaboration involving both developing and developed countries, we can extend the lite rature and understand components that are particularly critical for collaboration between developing and developed countries; (3) Distri buted scientific collaborations such as collaboratories are usually externally funded projects and thus funding constitutes an important incentive to motivate participation. In open resour ce development and Wikipedia authorship, participants are usually self motivated, not necessarily limited by organizationa l constraints, nor encouraged by their organizations to participate by their organizations. By contrast, potential OER contributors, especially those who work for colleges and universities, tend to be non-funded self-selected participants who are potentially constrained and enabled by their institutional policy and resources. In addition, participants may not have sufficient technical e xpertise or technical support to create or publish OER. By studyi ng the Health OER project, we can understand factors that affect distributed collaboration when participants are not externally funded but are constrained by their local organizations. The paper is organized as follows: we review literature that is related to distributed collaboration for knowledge creation; then we introduce the Health OER pr oject; in Section Four, we describe research methodology; in Section Five, we present our findings, including current status of cross-institutional collaboration in Health OER, benefits of such collaboration, and challenges of collaboration; in Sect ion Six, we present a model to support productive, scalable and sustainable collaboration. We conclude with discussions of our research findings. We draw three related streams of research to support our study. These include research on distributed scientific collaboration, cyberinfrastructure, and open source development and Wikipedia. Olson and colleagues [21] deve loped the Theory of Remote Scientific Collaboration (TORSC) based on their own research on scientific collaboratories and pr evious studies of distributed collaboration. The TORSC also asserts that there are five clusters of factors that are critical to success in distributed collaboration. The first cluster, nature of the work , refers to tasks involved in distributed collaborative work that range from ambiguous or highly interdependent to loosely coupled and easily modularized work. More ambiguous or highly interdependent work requires more frequent real-time comm unication and coordination, which points to cluster number two: management, planning, and decision-making. In order to achieve collaboration success, the involved parties need to have common ground : mutual knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions regarding management style. Collaborator s also need to have cluster number four, collaboration readiness , which means that collaborators are motivated to collaborate, they enjoy working together, and they trust each other. The way that distributed collaboration is organized and managed is critical to its success. The leadership, time that participants can commit to the collaboration, effectiveness and timeliness of communication, mechanisms for decision making, and clarity of institutional and individual roles and responsibilities are all important. Finally, people participating in distributed collaboration also need to have technology readiness , which means participants have the appropriate technology on hand to complete their collaborative tasks and to feel comfortable using that technology. The TORSC offers a comprehens ive framework to understand factors that lead to successful distributed scientific collaboration. TORSC, however, is largely ba sed on research findings from collaborations within develope d countries. Consequently, the TORSC does not address issues pa rticular to collaboration that involves both developing and de veloped countries, such as resource disparity and power differentials. Recent years have seen efforts in higher education and research institutions to develop cyberinfrastructure to support large-scale distributed interdisciplinary research. Researchers argue that cyberinfrastructure stretches across three scales: institutionalizing, enacting technology, and organizing work [22,23]. Institutionalizing requires gene ration of  X  X ustainable goods and services, X  such as governance and funding, that support distributed scientific collabora tion. Enacting technology requires building and designing technologies to support data management and sharing across organizations a nd generations of participants, and to support participants X  co mmunication. Organizing work requires managing organizationa l arrangements to motivate participants, coordinate work, and produce favorable outcomes. Previous literature on cyberinfrast ructure, which tends to focus on more mature collaborations, emphasizes the importance of managing ongoing projects and building an infrastructure that supports long-term distributed co llaboration. These findings are also relevant to nascent collaborations such as Health OER, which is still developing a long-term sustainable infrastructure. While studies on distributed scien tific collaboration focus on how to achieve effective collaboration by overcoming various restrictions caused by organi zational and national boundaries, research on open source developm ent and Wikipedia concentrates on how such self-organized communities achieved collaboration effectiveness through coordination, communication, and explicit and implicit norms. Kittur and Kraut [13] and Moon and Sproull [19] show that even in free and open environments, leadership is required to set up direction and structure to which distributed people can contribute. Bu tler et al. [4] find that evolving rules, policies, and guidelines could serv e the broad range of structures and activities needed to sustain Wikipedia. Structures in these self-contained communities also sustain and enforce strong community norms, which also ensure s high-quality products [14]. The above-mentioned th ree streams of resear ch offer a framework to examine what lead to success of distributed collaboration. In our study, we examine the collaboration readiness, technology readiness, institutional policies, and project management that facilitate distributed collaborat ion for OER production, paying specific attention to how collaboration in OER is different from other distributed collaboration st udied in previous literature. Health OER involves collaboration between University M in the United States, University K and University G in Ghana, University C and University W in South Africa, and an educational NGO (Edu-NGO), based in Kenya and South Africa. The Health OER project aimed to develop a sustainable and scalable OER program to improve h ealth education and training in Africa. The Health OER Design Phase Proposal was approved by by a U.S. philanthropic funding agency in November 2008. The project began in January 2009 and completed in February 2010 [9]. The funding agency renewed the funding of the project, starting a two-year phase in 2010 with the focus on building the continent-wide African Health OER Network [10]. The success of OER production depends on collaboration among numerous players who fulfill a variety of roles as shown in Figure 1. Subject experts, including faculty members, lecturers, and other educators, produce educational ma terials; instructional designers assist subject experts in assessi ng learning needs and goals and developing learning materials; lear ning technologists help design educational technology infrastru cture and provide technical support to OER content creators and users; researchers conduct studies in order to understand production processes and various use of OER; and users apply OE R materials to various purposes and in different contexts (e.g., instructors integrate OER into their teaching curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment; independent learners use OER for their self development). Collaboration needs vary for the different players and their roles. Semi-structured interviews were the study X  X  primary data collection method. Selection of pa rticipants for interviews began with convenience sampling and was followed by snowball sampling methods. The purpose of the snowball sampling was to identify possible participants who were actively involved in OER. A contact person, usually a Principa l Investigator (PI) or a project manager, was the source of initial recruitment. They pointed us to active participants of the Health OER project. OER were not yet in use when we conducted the study, so we interviewed mainly individuals who contributed to OER content production. The interview protocol included open-ended questions, which were built upon literature review and research questions. The interviews aimed to collect data on the need for cross-institutional collaboration in OER as well as social and technical challenges in creating and sharing OER. We interviewed 52 participants from October to December 2009. Generally, the interviews lasted from forty minutes to an hour. Most in terviews were conducted in the interviewees X  offices. When this was not possible, we conducted interviews by telephone or Skype. All of the interviews were audio recorded with the consent of participants. Table 1 shows the number of interviewees at each institution and the roles interviewees play in the Health OER project. 
Institution Manage Data in this study consisted of transcripts from interviews and documents posted on various we bsites about the interview participants and the Health OER project. After receiving the transcripts, we reviewed each transcript for accuracy and fidelity to audio recordings. Completed transcripts and field notes were imported into QSR International X  X  NVivo 8.0 research software for qualitative analysis. After carefully reading interview transcripts and field notes, we coded the data for content. We then analyzed the codes for emergent concepts and themes, which were organized into conceptual and th ematic categories. The NVivo 8.0 research software enabled us to visually sort conceptual themes within and across participant inte rviews, generate  X  X odes X  that allowed us to aggregate conceptual themes across interviews, and produce  X  X rees X  and  X  X emos X  that enabled us to construct interrelationships among these c onceptual themes. Finally, we rechecked the data to verify that conceptualizations and emergent theoretical perspectives represented valid readings of the data. We adopted several strategies to pursue reliability and validity in this study. We provide details about subject se lection, data collection, and data analysis. We also used low-inference descriptors [12] and method an d data triangulation [12]. When reporting our findings, we include many direct quotations. We used semi-structured interviews and document analysis for method triangulation. For data triangulation, we conducted interviews with participants in the Health OER project from institutions in both developing and developed countries, interviewed both junior and seni or faculty, interviewed staff working on technical support for Health OER, and interviewed project Principal Investigators (PIs). We asked the Health OER participants about their motivations and expectations for collaboration, which helped us consider how to meet participants X  expectat ions and how to determine the criteria that best evaluate the success of collaboration [24]. Access to geographically bounded knowledge . Instructors expressed a need to access teachi ng materials concerning diseases common to a specific geographical area, for example tropical diseases in Ghana. When participants at University M in the U.S. were asked about how they would benefit from working with their colleagues in Africa, some me ntioned that globalization had increased the need for U.S. medical students to educate themselves about foreign dis eases. Working with African colleagues would enable U.S. st udents to have more access to materials about geographica lly bounded diseases. A faculty member at a South African institution mentioned that distance education is an important component of their university X  X  educational goals. Their program serves students across the continent who need to be familiar with diseases prevalent across all of Africa. Thus, it is importa nt for the South African program to collaborate with instructors from institutions in other African countries to create materials about these geographically bounded diseases. As this faculty member explained: Accumulation of distributed knowledge/teaching materials. Instructors in Africa emphasized that their educational and research needs differ from those of U.S. institutions because of the dissimilarity in diseases, patient cases, and social contexts across the two continents. However, most teaching materials are published in Western countries. Thus, accumulating cases from a diversity of African areas, espe cially understanding how these cases are treated and managed, will broaden the expertise of both learners and instructors in Africa as well as in Western countries. For example, one faculty member from University W mentioned that South African physicians see HIV-associated lymphoma much more frequently than physic ians in Western countries. She further explained how accumulating such cases would benefit teaching and research: Another faculty member in the field of Occupational Therapy at University C in South Africa stated that in their field, because of the lack of qualified instructors, learners were sometimes taught by European instructors who were not familiar with the local contexts in Africa. OER, however , could provide opportunities for African researchers and instructors to work together to write curriculum and components that ap ply to African practices. This faculty member explained, Academics in Africa wish to create teaching materials that are suitable for an African context. They expect that OER provides a new avenue to share distributed knowledge across the continent. The need to accumulate distributed knowledge/teaching materials also results from local instituti ons X  being unable to produce a significant amount of the needed teaching materials. For example, a faculty member from a South A frican institution mentioned that most of the students in his department are not native English speakers. This language barrier, as well as cultural barriers and lack of experience with patient interaction, make it difficult for students to improve their pati ent-doctor communication skills. Instructors believe that video reco rding students X  interactions with patients at clinical settings and showing the videos to the students later will help students identify their problems in the process of medical communication. Due to ethical review issues and time and resource constraints, it is di fficult for an individual institution to amass a large number of these videos. One instructor suggested that a collection of doctor-patient interaction videos from different institutions could cover a variety of clinic situations and would provide more comprehens ive teaching materials. Connecting isolated faculty. For some instructors , because their subject area is highly specific or because of a lack of faculty in a field that pays better in industry over academia, it is difficult for these instructors to find local colleagues who share their research interests. These isolated individuals hope to find faculty and researchers at other institutions with whom they can collaborate and co-create teaching materials. One faculty member from University W explained how sh e would benefit from connecting with researchers and instructors in her discipline from other institutions: Defining curriculum of a discipline. In some disciplines, such as public health the core curriculum is not well defined. OER provides an opportunity for people to discuss a potential core curriculum. Faculty and instructors at the School of Public Health of University W hope that they can collaborate with other institutions to  X  X rim down X  and decide on a core curriculum as well as define unit standards fo r various course models. One of the faculty members at University W noted, Cross-institutional and cro ss-role resource sharing. Cross-role collaboration involves the OER content producers working together to accomplish a common goal. This can occur within a single institution or across participating institutions, which is known as cross-role, cross-instit utional collaboration (CRCIC). At the time of the writing this paper, no CRCIC had taken place, but it is hoped that in the future it will due to its potential benefits, which include increased efficiency in OER production and decreased costs. Issues of intellectual property and copyright make CRCIC especially helpful. For example, many instructors cannot publish some images from their course materials as OER due to the copyright and intellectual pr operty restrictions. Finding replacement images can be diffi cult and time-consuming. An alternative way to solve the pr oblem involves having a medical illustration artist draw these images , but this is a costly solution for instructors at University M in the U.S. Fortunately, the cost of having medical illustrations drawn in Africa is much lower. So, University M faculty and instructors mentioned that they could work with medical illustration artists in Ghana to produce the needed images courses that could be shared at minimal cost.
 Sharing best practices. Technical support personnel also reported that they would benefit from cross-institutional collaboration. Because OER is a new educational venue, there is no established technical infrastructure for OER production and use, meaning people from individual institutions are working on building technical infrastructure and exploring what kind of infrastructure is more efficient. It will be bene ficial for different institutions to share best practices. Thus, technologists also hope they can share their experiences and be inspired by each other about how they solve different problems in different situations, for example, what software to use. As one of the interviewees stated, Our interviews with OER particip ants have revealed the Health OER participants X  needs and expectations for cross-institutional and cross-national collaboration. We asked participants about the perceived benefits from current collaborative activities in the Health OER project. In doing so, we could identify factors that facilitate collaboration in Health OER. When the interviews were conducted, the interviewees reported that they had seldom worked with people from other institutions to create teaching materials. Interactions between institutions had focused on helping individuals and institutions build collaboration readiness and technology readiness. Olson et al. [21] state that collaboration readiness includes both work and social dimensions. Work related dimensions include the collaborative culture of a scienc e domain, alignment of goals of sub-groups, and recognition of reciprocally needed skills. Social dimensions include whether colla borative parties like and trust each other and whether they are motivated to work together. Most of the factors discussed by Olson et al. [21] apply to the collaborations where pa rticipants are somewhat clear about their collaborative goals and tasks. The Health OER project, however, is still at its nascent stage. The interviewees reported that most of the instructors in their institution s were not very clear about what OER was and what they could achieve through working with people from other institutions. In addition, the Health OER project involves institutions from both developing and developed countries. Thus, factors that aff ect participants  X  collaboration readiness are not limited to those discussed in Olson et al. [21]. These factors include raising awareness of OER, aligning resources and mitigati ng power relationships. Raising awareness of OER . In its beginning stages, the Health OER remains an innovative idea and many participants had limited knowledge of OER. The Health OER effort endeavored to raise participants X  awareness through workshops and funding physician educators X  site visits. Workshops organized by the Health OER project enabled participants to understand what OER was and what participating institutions could accomplish through OER. In 2009, several workshops were organized in Ghana and South Africa respectively. University M in the U.S. had begun OER efforts much earlier than the Ghanaian and South African institutions, and the workshop exposed participants from African universities to University M X  X  experiences in OER production. Based on University M X  X  experiences, participants in the workshop outlined content their institutions might produce. One participant mentioned that before she attended the workshop, she had already created some OER for her own st udents. During the workshop, she was impressed and inspired by what people from University M had done. She understood she could achieve much more than what she had previously accomplished in OER. At one workshop she saw that another university had tried to publish their archived educational materials as OER. The participant realized that if her own institution X  X  archived dental images were organized and tagged, they would be an ex cellent Health OER resource. Site visits by physician educators also helped raise awareness of OER. Ghanaian participants reported that some of them became aware of the Health OER in 2008 when a University M delegation organized workshops at University K and University G in Ghana. However, participants reported that they could not conceptualize how they could produce OER until Dr. E from University M came to visit their institution in Ghana and showed them OER he had produced at University M. As one faculty member at University K commented: The faculty member X  X  comments confirm Zimmerman X  X  [27] argument about the importance of conceptualization of innovation, that is,  X  X ow the i nnovation can be applied in the achievement of work-related goals X . When OER remained an abstract idea for the Ghanaian academics, they could not vision they would contribute to OER with their own institutional resources. Only after Dr. E helped Ghanaian academics conceptualize that OER production was possible in the Ghanaian institutional context, and how OER could be integrated into their curriculum, could they start working for OER. Assisting individual institutions in formulating policies. At the interviews, the interviewees fro m all institutions unanimously mentioned that one of the major challenges for OER productions is the lack of incentive. None of the institutions studied had specific policies on how to reward OER production. Faculty and instructors who worked on OER were motivated by their enthusiasm to explore alternativ e teaching methods and the use of educational technol ogies to enhance student X  X  learning experiences. Because OER was not included in promotion evaluation documentation submitted to upper management, it was difficult to incentivize instructors beyond the current circle of early adopters. Because cross-institutional collaboration involves more time and effort to overc ome challenges brought about by distance and national and organizational cultural difference, it is even more difficult to motivate faculty and instructors to participate in cross-institutional collaboration for OER production until they realize the benefit of a growing collection of contributed OER from all participating institutions. The challenge of lack of motiv ation to produce OER represents what Ribes and Finholt call a tension between  X  X areer rewards and community interests X  [22,23]. Ev en though instructors knew that OER production would improve edu cation, they felt discouraged when their efforts were not directly related to their career rewards. Thus, it is essential to for in dividual institutions to establish policies to incentivize OER production. Institutions also need to formulate policies to clarify in tellectual property and copyright issues. Health OER X  X  experience confirms Ribes and Finholt X  X  [22,23] argument about the importance of  X  X nstitutionalizing, X  that is, to create adequate governance and funding to support distributed collaboration. Thus, we argue that in addition to work dimensions and social dimensions as stated by Olson et al. [21], collaboration readiness shoul d also include institutional dimensions. Our data also suggests how Health OER as a virtual organization assisted participating institutions in the  X  X nstitutionalizing X  process. Health OER is a new concept for all the participating universities and thus the upper management of each participating university valued Edu-NGO X  X  help in drafting policies related to Health OER. Experiences and expertise of an OER strategist and other consultants from Edu-NGO enabled them to provide valuable advice. For example, at an interview at University W, the interviewee shared with the interviewer the institution X  X  drafted policy for OER production. He em phasized that assistance from Edu-NGO was essential. An OER strategist an d consultants went to University W, examined all the relevant policies, and talked to executive management. In doing so, the OER strategist and consultants familiarized themselves with the university needs and existing policies, and could offer their advice in response to  X  X  stated need. X  Furthermore, the institutions posted their draft policies on their internal website so that they could learn from others X  experiences. Aligning resources . Resource disparity is a primary problem reported in previous studies of collaboration between developed and developing countries [2,8]. Lack of physical and human resources hinders African part icipants from producing high-quality work. Thus, resource ali gnment is vital to alleviate collaboration problems. Supporte d by a Gates Foundation grant, University M could help Ghanaian institutions purchase and ship equipment that was needed by Ghanaian participants. This equipment included laptops, Camt asia screen capture software, hard drives, Flip video cameras, tr ipods, etc. Because participants from University M have more expe riences with OER, they could also make recommendations to Ghanaian universities regarding equipment purchases. This kind of resource a lignment enabled Ghanaian participants to work efficiently and produce high-quality work. Mitigating the impact of power differentials. Power differentials are another frequently reported pr oblem in collaboration between developing and developed countries. Previous research often reports that researchers from developed countries usually exert more influence in decision-making on research agendas, project management, and budget planning [2 ,8,17]. At our interviews, when the participants were aske d about failed collaboration they had experienced, most of them mentioned  X  X rtificial collaboration. X  In this type of collaboration, even though African participants are clear about thei r needs and wants, they do not express their needs either because they are not given the chance to or because they fear losing funds. The Health OER project was funded by a U.S. philanthropic funding agency and facilitated by University M in the U.S. African participants, however, reported that they did not feel that the funding agency or University M imposed their agenda on individual participating institu tions. Edu-NGO, which has rich experiences in working with African institutions, played the role of a boundary spanner [15,18], and assisted the funding agency and University M in understanding the context of working with African institutions as well as understanding individual institutions X  needs and how the goal of the Health OER project could align with individual institutions X  educational goals. One interviewee from Edu-NGO explained the way they worked with individual institutions: Even though Edu-NGO and University M coordinated and facilitated grant writing and workshops, they emphasized communicating with individuals and being  X  X pen minded. X  Participants from African institutions felt they were welcome to voice their concerns and suggesti ons. Interviewees also reported they felt they were  X  X eal partners X  in the process of grant writing and decision making. Olson et al. [21] and Ribes and Finholt [22] state that the success of distributed scientific co llaboration relies on technology readiness. Collaboration participan ts should be comfortable with technologies; technologies should be reliable and sustainable; there should be adequa te technical support at participants X  local institutions; and technological infrastructure supporting collaborative work should consid er the needs of users with different bandwidth. While Olson et al. [21] and Ribes and Finholt [22] discuss technology readin ess, they mainly consider technologies for collaborative work such as data sharing and communication. For OER, instruct ors typically need to not only understand the technologies for collaborative work, they also need to become familiar with the te chnologies necessary for digital production of OER, such as lecture capturing, editing, etc. The Health OER project promoted participants X  technology readiness through knowledge transfer, which was achieved through workshops and site visits. Participants reported that through workshops they learned about the OER production process, tool s used for OER development, and how intellectual property and copyright issues were resolved. For example, one technical s upport staff from a Ghanaian university recalled that he was introduced to Camtasia screen-capturing software at the training workshop. He said he had heard about the software in the past, but the workshop helped him understand how Camtasia could be used to record lectures and produce OER. Other participants mentioned that they did not realize the importance of copyright and intellectual issues until they attended workshops on these topics. Site visits by physician educat ors also contributed to knowledge transfer. Working side by side with professors, students, and technicians mainly at University K, Dr. E from University M instructed and advised on their initial OER productions. Being a physician himself, Dr. E X  X  me dical knowledge enabled him to work with Ghanaian physicians to both brainstorm potentially useful OER resources and consider what technologies would best communicate those resources (video, text, etc.). Being familiar with information technology, Dr . E could also show Ghanaian physicians how to use the te chnologies for OER production. Participants reported that through working with Dr. E, they became familiar with OER development tools and techniques and understood what technology infras tructure was needed for OER production. One physician from Un iversity K described how he benefited from working with Dr. E, University M staff members X  vis its also assisted in knowledge transfer. Knowledge transfer does not mean simply transplanting knowledge and experiences from one institution to another. Social, cultural, and organizational bounda ries and distance separate participants in collaboration. These boundaries result in dissimilar paradigms, norms, incongruent tem poral rhythms, and behavioral expectations [15,5]. Knowledge tran sfer is effective only when we understand how knowledge can be applied in different contexts. Thus, promoting participants X  mutu al understanding is critical for cross-institutional collaboration. While University M X  X  staff members worked in African institutions, they familiarized themselves with local culture and institutional management structure. For example, while Mr. P worked at University K, he met or worked with various key players including the Communication Design group, physicians, and an ICT support group. Meeting or working with these people enabled Mr. P to obtain a better understanding of re sources available at University K for OER production and what support University K needed. When Ms. K from University M worked at the African institutions over a three-month period, she conducted information-gathering meetings with members of the OER teams at each institution and researched local copyright law and institutional intellectual property policies. She built profe ssional working relations with OER teams at each institution. Ms. K X  X  working experiences at each institution enabled her to become a communication broker between the six partners. She could also provide valuable resources that helped University M X  X  OER team members understand the organization culture of other institutions and how they should communicate with members from other institutions. While at African institutions, staff members from University M worked on capacity building through presentations and workshops on OER advocacy and OER production. Their knowledge of the African institutions X  organiza tion culture and technological infrastructure enabled them to offer advice on OER production based on their understanding of different institutional contexts. We also asked our interviewees about the social and technical challenges in collaboration for OER production. The participants X  perception informs us about how to build a productive, scalable and sustainable collaboration model for OER production. These challenges include issues of bu ilding both collaboration and technology readiness. Challenges in building collaboration readiness include lack of people awareness, asymmetrical needs for collaboration, and competition among institutions. Lack of people awareness. Most of the interviewees stated that even though they saw the benefits of cross-institutional collaboration, they did not know how to initiate collaboration. In particular, participants did not know  X  X hat the person [from other institutions] does, the skill he has, the interest of the person, and productions that he X  X  done. X  T hus, even though they hoped to collaborate with people from other institutions, it was difficult for them to identify specific collaborators. Instructors at University G and University K reported that their cross-institutional collaboration was limited to communication with people they knew from University M who worked in their institutions, for example, Dr. E. Thus, University M became an information-clearing house on developments at participating institutions in the Health OER. This is anticipated to be a bottleneck when trying to scale the Health OER Network, thus there must be means in the future to enable peer level connections. Asymmetrical needs for collaboration. While faculty and instructors from Africa stated clearly how they might benefit professionally from cross-institutional collaboration, many University M instructors mentioned that they could not see how collaboration with their African colleagues would directly benefit their teaching and research work. Even though University M instructors believe that collaboration with their African colleagues would help their students know mo re about foreign diseases and they also wanted to offer help to their African colleagues, many did not think this kind of collaborative work would be on their priority list. Competition. Participants reported that one of the benefits of OER was to increase their institution X  X  competitiveness and reputation. They argued that the amount of influence they can have on the decision making process of the Health OER project was defined by their OER production. When asked about their institution X  X  influence on decision-making in Health OER, one of the interviewees mentioned that it would depend on their  X  X ctivity X  and  X  X he level of activity X  in the Health OER project. He commented: This faculty member X  X  comment im plies that participants in the Health OER project are competing with each other. They want to demonstrate their institutional ca pacity to produce qualified and sophisticated OER. It is unclear yet what competition means for OER collaboration. Competition may motivate each participating institution to produce high-quality OER. On the other hand, competition may constitute a potential barrier to cross-institutional collaboration. If institutions want to display their capacity through their independent contribution to the Health OER, they may not want to work with people from other institutions. In the early stage of the Health OER project, participants were exploring and learning technologies for OER production and publication. Consequently they were eager to learn from other institutions and desired more information exchange between institutions. However, there had not been a coordinator that facilitates information sharing between participating institutions, as one of the interviewees noted: Participants also reported th at the limited exchange among institutions had been restricted to exchanges among faculty members. For example, at wo rkshops, there were no sessions dedicated to technical issu es. Technical support personnel expressed that they desired more avenues for information exchange in this area. As one of the interviewees commented regarding the workshops: The above findings reveal that pa rticipants in the Health OER project expect that they can in crease the quality and productivity of their OER production by collaborating with faculty members and instructors from other institutions. They believe that these collaborators can provide complementary knowledge and skills. However, at the time when this study was conducted, challenges existed that hindered cross-ins titutional collaboration. These challenges include participants X  lack of awareness of OER, lack of institutional policy to incentivize and support OER production, and lack of awareness of a nd means to identify potential collaborators. In view of the above findings, we propose a model for productive, scalable and sustainable collabora tion as shown in Figure 2. This model consists of three major part s: productivity, scalability, and sustainability. Productivity. Our research findings indicate that a productive collaboration model should enab le participants to overcome challenges in collaboration an d access geographically bound knowledge, connect isolated re searchers and instructors, accumulate distributed knowledge, and share best practices for OER production. Scalability. In order to ensure scalability of OER, at its early stage, it is important to build potential participants X  collaboration readiness and technology readiness. Efforts should be extended to help potential OER contributors conceptualize OER and its scope. Our research findings also indi cate the necessity of assessing resource discrepancy. In the H ealth OER project, resource disparity between developed and developing countries calls for alignment of resources. When people are exploring the social and technical infrastructure needed for OER production and sharing, knowledge transfer and information exchange must be a priority so that participants can inspire and learn from each other. In particular, technology and knowledge transfer to the new partners will be critical when expanding the Health OER Network. Sustainability. Compared to distributed scientific collaboration where participants often identify their collaborators because of common funding mechanisms and shared instruments or datasets, it is more difficult for potential OER contributors to identify adequate collaborators. An online community of practice for OER should be established to f acilitate information exchange, accelerate innovation diffusion, and connect isolated faculty members. This online community of practice will serve as an information resource about partic ipating OER individuals at each institution. Through the online community, participants will be able to identify each participant X  X  specialty, skill, and the types of materials being produced or the types of materials participants wish to produce. This online res ource can also serve as a shared virtual working space. For example, people can post questions and answers on specific technical issues and share experiences about how they resolved these issues. As revealed by the interviews, participants feel more motivated and inspired when they saw what their colleagues achieved through OER. Thus, sharing success stories of participants from different institutions through virtual communities of practice will motive more participants. An OER directory should be built into the online community. The OER directory would provide a high level overview of what teaching materials are available in an appropriately categorized manner. In addition to tagging and search capability, the directory serves as a central hub for OER resources. The idea is that in the absence of such an easily accessible directory, many educators could be reinvesting the wheel. Unlike the traditional approaches to directories, there are RSS feeds that allow OER created in multiple platforms to be aggregated in a single search space. Thus, a sustainable model allows for multiple OER repositories with several ways of accessi ng and using resources. The directory provides a way of ensuring that OER resources can be easily be searched and found. The directory would have triggers of RSS feeds every time the OER is updated. This would mean that, depending on the work role, task, and other constraining factors, the direct ory could contain geographically bound information. In order to ensure accountability across institutions and efficiency of information exchange, a communication plan is needed. Key elements of the communication plan include assigning a project manager at each participating institution and assigning a project manager for the whole OER projec t. Identified project managers at individual institutions will be responsible for regular updates about their institution X  X  OER deve lopment. Thes e contact people will be the first point of contact for all participants from other institutions when questions arise. The project manager should be responsible for regular updates of development at each institution to all the involved institutions. OER offers new opportunities for education. OER can theoretically be leveraged to build an Open Participatory Learning Infrastructure (OPLI) [3,1], which w ill enable instructors all over the world to find adequate collaborators and co-create educational materials. Our findings have re vealed instructors X  needs and expectations for cross-institutional collaboration to produce OER. However, collaboration does not occur in a vacuum. Effective self-coordinated and self-sustain ing collaboration can only be attained when social, organizational, and cultural issues are resolved at the same time [1]. A self-organized and self-coordina ted collaboration consists of interactions between many sub-co mponents, which are influenced by their local social and technical environments. In contrast to open source developers and Wikipe dia authors, interviewees for this study expressed more concerns about institutional constraints. Our findings reveal that major ba rriers to collaboration for OER production at the nascent stage incl ude lack of collaboration and technology readiness resulting from inadequate institutional support. The participating instituti ons in the Health OER project displayed a lack of institutional policy to incentivize OER participation and a lack of institutional technological infrastructure to support individu al instructors X  OER production. Our research also finds that most institutions do not have adequate technical infrastructure for OER production. In recent years, more and more online resources become available to facilitate OER production and publication (e.g., Connexions [7], Wikieducator [16]). These resources, however , cannot be efficiently or effectively used by potential OER creators, most of whom are not familiar with the technologies required for producing educational materials (e.g., video clips) and publishing these materials. It is unrealistic to require each individual instructor to master technical skills demanded by OER production and publishing, and thus to establish institutional infrast ructure for OER production is essential. Thus, at the nascent stage of a collaboration, collaboration readiness and t echnology readiness should start working at institutional level. We should extend Olson et al. [21] X  X  notion of collaboration readiness and include institutional dimensions of collaboration readiness. Compared to collaboration within developed countries, issues resulting from resource disparity and power differentials are more salient in collaboration between developing and developed countries. Our research findings reveal that efforts to align resources and mitigate the impact of power differentials are essential for building collaboration readiness. Although, ultimately, OER collaboration should be a self-sustaining collective knowledge creation system similar to Wikipedia, a virtual or ganization such as the Health OER project could serve as a mechanism for transition and growth. At the early stage of OER dissemination, a vi rtual organization such as the Health OER can help potential OER contributors to build their collaboration and technology read iness. A virtual organization helps raise awareness of OER through workshops, seminars, and show-and-tell sessions. It can also assist participating institutions in formulating policies that motivate OER production. A virtual organization can also advise participating institutions on building their institutional infrastructure for OER production. 1. Atkins, D., Brown, J.S., and Hammond, A. A Review of the 2.
