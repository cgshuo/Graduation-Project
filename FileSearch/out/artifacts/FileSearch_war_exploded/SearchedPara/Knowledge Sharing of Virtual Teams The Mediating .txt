 With the development of the communication technologies of recent decades, the world has become a global village. These communication technologies, such as the Internet revolution of the '90s and the mobile revolution in recent years, have provided the nece ssary infrastructure to support the development of new organizational structures. One of the innovations ensuing from this revolution is the creation of a new type of teamwork, in addition the traditional face -to -face team: the virtual or distributed team. Thanks to information and communication technology systems, these teams communicate, work together, share knowledge, solve problems, and make decisions across the globe .
 However, these virtual teams have created new challenges. One of these challenges is the lack of interpersonal relationships. This absence can deeply affect the level of trust within the team, relies on interpersonal relationships and is critical to the team's proper functioning. Having a better understanding of the impact of communicatio n and trust on knowledge sharing in virtual teams can assist organizations increase their efficiency, their performance, and the quality of their outcomes, thus enabling organizations to increase their competitiveness . Virtual teams have been commonly defined as ICT -mediated functioning teams that may cross several different boundaries [1,2,3,4]. The main element which defines virtual teams is that it comprises people who communicate and are dispersed across space, time, and/or organizational boundaries [5,6]. Despite the distance, virtual teams need to work together, and collaboration is essential. These teams can create outcomes that cannot be achieved by an individual [3].
 In today X  X  global world, where virtual teams a re very common, generating new knowledge and using it to produce new products or services is crucial for maintaining or even enhancing companies' competitiveness. Knowledge management is becoming one of the main sources of companies' sustainable competitiv e advantages [7]. It allows sharing and synchronizing knowledge for the purpose of decision making and achieving common objectives [8]. Knowledge sharing can be defined as  X  X he willful application of one X  X  ideas, insights, solutions, and experiences to ano ther individual, either via an intermediary, such as a computer -based system, or directly X  [9 ]. Hence, collaborative knowledge sharing can play a critical role in bringing people together with their knowledge, experience, and skills. These team members ar e able to contribute to team development more effectively than individual team members performing their narrow tasks [ 10 ] .
 Communication has often been cited by scholars as an antecedent of knowledge sharing [7]. Furthermore, empirical evidence has provid ed support for the influence of members X  communication styles in explaining knowledge sharing in organizations [11,12]. Communication is an important process for any team. However, it is particularly important for virtual teams [13,14]. Communication is n ot only an important process; it is a real challenge in the virtual environment, due to obstacles, such as different time zones, cultural gaps, as well as distance [15]. The absence of physical contact makes it more challenging to establish durable relatio nships and bonds that lead to high levels of trust, thus making the communication process more difficult [16]. Virtual teams in particular require a dynamic relationship across various members and work groups [14,13]. The literature often distinguishes between two aspects of communication within the team  X   X  task -oriented communication and relationship -oriented communication [17,18,6,19]. The first focuses on how well project information, tasks. and deliverables are being handled through communication. It includes communication such as planning and scheduling of work, coordinating subordinates' activities, and providing necessary supplies, equipment, and technical assistance. The second provides the basis and desire for tea m members to communicate with each other over time. Its main aim is maintaining a positive psycho -social dynamic within the team, such as showing confidence and trust toward colleagues, acting friendly and caring, trying to understand the problems of subor dinates, helping them develop and pursue their careers, keeping them informed, appreciating their ideas, and recognizing their accomplishments. [20].
 Trust has been identified by scholars as one of the outcomes of communication [21,17,22], with relationship communication playing a central role [22]. Additionally, trust has been identified as an antecedent to the willingness to share knowledge [23,24].
 Team trust is function of the other team members' perceived ability, integrity, and benevolence, as well a s of the members' own propensity of trust [25]. In order to trust, and therefore be willing to rely on another party, to take risks, and to be vulnerable, teammates must create social and interpersonal relationships with each other [26,25,27]. Based on the concept that trust seems to have both rational and emotional foundations, McAllister [28] has developed a model incorporating cognitive and affective dimensions to trust. According to his model, when trust is based on cognition, individuals use rational t hought in order to trust others. Cognition trust refers to performance -relevant cognitions, such as competence, responsibility, reliability, and dependability [29]. But when the interaction between team members is intense, the emotional and mutual investme nt in the relationship becomes primordial; this is where the affective aspect of trust comes into play [30]. The emotional engagement created by this intense interaction highlights empathy, affiliation, and rapport, based on a foundation of shared regard a mong team members [29]. Therefore, to maintain trust in the long term, the affective aspect of the relationship must be developed [28]. In light of this, even if high levels of trust at an early stage of the team are possible, perhaps driven by cognitive c ues from group membership and reputation, affective trust needs to develop later in the development of the team [31]. Thus, as a result, cognitive and affective dimensions of trust are often tightly intertwined in work relationships .
 Studies examining the linkages between communication, trust and knowledge sharing in virtual teams are abundant. Several studies have focused on associations between communication and trust [32,14,33], others on communication and sharing knowledge [34,35] and others on trust an d knowledge sharing [36,37,38]. However, to our knowledge, no study has yet examined the relationship between all three in a virtual environment . Some researchers have argued that trust has a direct impact on team functioning [39,40], [5,41]. The current study is based on the argument that trust is a mediating factor and that all three components  X  X  relationship communication, trust, and knowledge sharing  X  X  are linked as f ollows: (1) communication with trust, (2) communication with knowledge sharing, and (3) trust with knowledge sharing. The study model claims that trust acts as a mediating factor between relationship communication and knowledge sharing . 3.1. Research model In sum, a mediation model is proposed that relates to the variables investigated in the present research (see Figure 1). A mediation model allows assessing how and under what conditions a given effect is produced. The study model suggests that the effect of relationship communication on sharing knowledge will be more likely to occur in virtual teams that have a high level of team trust. When a team trust climate is present, team members would be more willing to share knowledge without the f ear that sharing may reduce or jeopardize individuals X  job security .
 Accordingly, the following hypotheses are proposed : H1: Relationship communication is positively related to knowledge sharing.
 H2a: Relationship communication is positively related to cognitive trust.
 H2b: Relationship communication is positively related to affective trust.
 H3a: Cognitive trust is positively related to knowledge sharing.
 H3b: Affective trust is positively related to knowledge sharing.
 H4a: Cognitive trust mediates the relationship between relationship communication and knowledge sharing.
 H4b: Affective trust mediates the relationship between relationship communication and knowledge sharing. 3.2. Research Sample The final sample consisted of 25 9 completed questionnaires (out of 350 distributed) from all over the world, excepting Africa (106 from North America, 3 from South America, 68 from Europe, 72 from Asia, and 10 from Australia). The study was administered in several companies and was not l imited to specific sector The main principle behind maximum variation sampling is to gain greater insights into a phenomenon by viewing it from many angles. Therefore, most of the respondents worked in high -tech companies (e.g., electronics, software, comm unication, hardware, and services) and the remainder in finance, health care, marketing, and services industries .
 The process of validating the questionnaire comprised two steps. First, it was send to five colleagues to examine the questions and the quest ionnaire structure. Their feedback prompted several modifications in the formulation of questions, including grammatical changes. Second, a pilot sample of 25 participants completed the revised questionnaire, yielding Cronbach alpha values for internal con sistency, which led to further modifications. Among the respondents, 34.7% were women and 65.3% men; 17% of the participants worked on temporary virtual teams, 73.7% on ongoing virtual teams, and the remainder worked on both temporary and ongoing teams. L ikewise, 20.8% defined themselves as belonging to a local virtual team, 36.7% to a global virtual team, and the remainder defined themselves as belonging to both kinds of virtual teams. Finally, 39% defined themselves as team leaders, 49% as team members, and the rest acting both as team leaders and team members, depending on the project. A web survey was designed and distributed to groups working in a virtual environment via LinkedIn and Facebook . 3.3. Measurements For this study, cognitive trust and affecti ve trust were assessed utilizing modified survey items originally developed for a previous study [28]. Each of these two variables was assessed by five items. A previous study designated four items for the measurement of relationship communication [42]. An d finally, knowledge sharing [43] was assessed by three items. The measurement of the internal consistency reliability of these variables was performed using Cronbach X  X   X  for each of these variables (Table 1), with all meeting the requirement with values a bove .8. The items were measured on a 5 -point Likert scale, ranging from 1 ( X  X  X  strongly disagree X  X ) to 5 ( X  X  X  strongly agree X  X ).As Likert scales provide a non -parametric measurement and because all the statistical analyses in this study were based on pa rametric techniques, such as Pearson X  X  correlation and simple/multiple linear regression, all the variables were tested according Murray X  X  [44} methodology in order to determinate the compliance of the variables for parametric techniques. Based on this met hodology, parametric and non -parametric correlation techniques (i.e., Pearson r and Spearman rho analyses) were used to test whether similar results are observed. The study showed very similar results in both the level of significance and the strength of t he relationship. According to these results, parametric techniques could be used for the data analysis of the Likert scale data with no fear of reaching incorrect conclusions .
 To check if the items meet the requirements of factor analysis, three statistica l tests were conducted in SPSS: Cronbach's alpha If item deleted, corrected item -total correlation, and factor loading. Kaiser  X  Meyer  X  Olkin measurement showed acceptable results (KMO = .9), analysis was appropriate for the study. As a result of the Cronbach's alpha If item deleted test, one item was deleted from the knowledge sharing variable. All the variables items met the corrected item -total correlation requiremen t with a value above .3 [45]. And finally, all the variable items also met the factor loading requirement, with values above .32, based on 259 respondents [46].
 First, all the variables were tested for parametric assumption (e.g. normal distribution, homog eneity of variance, linearity and multicollinearity) to avoid non -accurate results producing Type I or Type II errors, or the over -or under -estimation of significance or effect size [45]. Hence, several key assumptions were tested and after some data corr ections, all the assumptions were met. The study's data could be considered as having a high level of confidence for reliability of the study's parametric tests .
 To test for mediation effect, the first step is to find evidence for a significant relationshi p between the independent variable, the dependent variable and the tested variables for mediation [47], to be tested with the use of Pearson X  X  correlation analysis .
 Then, to demonstrate the existence of a mediation effect, a methodology developed by Preach er and Hayes [48] was employed for mediation testing that facilitates estimation of the indirect effect with a normal theory approach and a bootstrap approach to obtain confidence intervals. Simple and multiple regression analyses were conducted to assess each component of the proposed mediation model. In the present study, the size of indirect effect 95% confidence interval was obtained through 5000 bootstrap resamples [49].
 In order to be able to compare the  X  strength between the results, standardized values (Z -scores) of the variables were used in the simple and multiple linear regressions. Two variables were entered as covariates at each of the linear regression analyses. These covariates (or controller va riables) were the type of virtual team based on time (i.e., temporary or ongoing) and the type of virtual team based on distance (i.e., local or global). The differentiations between local virtual teams vs. global teams, as well as temporary virtual teams vs. ongoing teams are the most common in the literature. Therefore, they were entered as controller variables to examine whether they affected the multiple mediation models of this study . 4.1. Correlation analysis Inter -correlations between all t he variables were calculated with Person X  X  r correlation analysis. First, correlation between the relationship communication was tested and found positively correlated with knowledge sharing, r (257) = .418, p &lt; .001. Thus, the first correlation hypothesis H1 is supported. Then, correlation between relationship communication and trust were tested to validate H2a and H2b.The results for relationship communication and affective trust were r (257) = .664, p &lt; .001; for relationship communication and cognitive t rust, Pearson's r (257) = .491, p &lt; .001. Thus, both hypotheses are supported. And finally, correlation between trust and knowledge sharing was also evaluated. Cognitive trust was found to be positively correlated with knowledge sharing, knowledge sharing, r (257) = .389, p &lt; .001. Therefore, both H3a and H3b are also supported .
 Hence, moderate to high significant effect size values were found (see Table 1), thus meeting all requirements for preliminary mediation effect tests [47]. This allowed us to continue the analysis to determine whether affective trust and cognitive trust had a mediating effect between relationship communication and knowledge sharing .
 4.2. Mediation analysis The Preacher and Hayes [48] methodology was run to validate the mediating effect of trust between relationship communication and knowledge sharing. Results of the mediation analysis confirmed the mediating role of cognitive trust, but rejected the role of affective trust in the association between relationship communication and knowledge sharing . Thus, the result for cognitive trust is  X =.203, CI=.13 to .28 with no -zero in the confidence intervals (CI), considered significant. However, for affective -based t rust, the result is  X =.007, CI= -.10 to .13 with a result of zero in the confidence interval (CI), and therefore it is considered non -significant. The direct effect is still significant; it implies that trust is a partial mediator and not a full one. Trust mediates about 52% of the relationship when only cognitive trust has an impact, with affective trust being found non -significant. Both covariates, local/global team ( p = .686) and temporary/ongoing team ( p = .485), did not achieve significance; thus, they did not affect the mediation model. And finally, this mediating model explained a significant proportion of the variance in relationship communication (adj -R2=.316, F(7,351)=17.73, p &lt; .001) (Table 2). The H4a hypothesis was supported, with cognitive -based trust being found to be a partial mediator. However, the H4b hypothesis was rejected, with affective -based trust seeming to have no impact on the relationship .
 The results indicate strong significant associations between the different variables of the study and a number of conclusions come into view. First, since it was found that relationship communication of teams in a virtual enviro nment is highly correlated to knowledge sharing, it can be used as scaffolding to knowledge transfer and empower the performance of virtual teams. Furthermore, according to the mediation model, developing cognitive trust within virtual teams would allow re lationship communication to have a greater impact on the willingness of the teammates to freely exchange knowledge and share insights between them without fear. Second, the study findings show that affective trust does not play a role in the impact of rel ationship communication to increase knowledge sharing. It seems that in the process of knowledge sharing, during communication, the teammates evaluate their colleagues' experience, professional knowledge, and skills. Doing that, performance -relevant evaluate colleagues' achievements, especially in distant relationship and distributed working in virtual environment. Third, in order to enable to teams to share knowledge in an optimal manner, it is crucial to use ICT channels. By allowing channels, such as video conference, social networks, or mobile apps, the relationship communication of the teams will become more social and authentic. While using ICT channels, it is imp ortant to emphasize cognitive trust rather than affective trust. For example , being open about disclosing personal professional background with teammates, such as sharing personal experiences in similar projects in the past or mentioning previous profess ional training relevant to the project at hand are essential for developing performance -relevant cognitions, such as competence, responsibility, reliability, and dependability within teams. Sharing knowledge of virtual teams is a complex proce ss. Nowadays, it is a recognized phenomenon, especially in global organizations. Knowledge is considered to be human capital and as such, is one of the main strategic resources in organizations. Since management of knowledge is critical to their success, o rganizations must capitalize on the knowledge they own and understand how knowledge is shared and transferred efficiently and effectively .
 It is acknowledged that in the current highly competitive business environment, organizations must be dynamic and abl e to adapt quickly to new situations and changes. Having a better understanding of communication and trust as an influential factor on virtual teams' knowledge -sharing processes may help organizations increase their efficiency, their performance, and the q uality of their outcomes, with the goal of increasing their competitiveness.
 This study's model can help organizations successfully confront the challenges presented by teams working in a virtual environment to share knowledge with their colleagues on a daily basis. Team leaders will be able to increase the level of knowledge sharing within their teams by using the appropriate ICT tool or channel, and the appropriate type of communication (relationship -based or task -based), in accordance with the organiza tion's aims and needs. They will be more aware of the importance of the trust -building process in their teams, including their cognitive and affective aspects, along with its important function as a mediator of the success of team knowledge sharing in virt ual environment .
