 Under the joint influence of the presentation of search results and users X  browsing and clicking habits, the click probability distribution does not merely obey a monotonic decreasing Zipf function. In this paper, we present evidence that the click behavior on the entries of search engines X  result pages is influenced by Serial Position Effect, which is independent of how these entries are ordered, and introduce a new function to characterize the click probability distribution.

As search engines become more and more dominant in information retrieval on the web, how search engines rank query results will significantly impact the popularity of web pages as well as the information users obtain. There are sev-eral mathematical and empirical studies on the click prob-ability of each entry of search results [13, 7, 3]. All these studies declare or assume that the click probability gener-ally follows a Zipf distribution, or, at least, that the lower a page is ranked, the less clicks it is supposed to receive. However, we observe a different distribution on query logs of a real search engine: in a single result page, the click ra-tio does not always decline as an entry is ranked backwards,

We compute the click probability distribution over the two logs from Sogou, and gain two highly resemble curves (Fig-ure 1. Middle ). Meanwhile, it is not just a special case, for we have noticed that the curves in the figures of some related researches (AltaVista [3]) have shown similar phenomena.
We also calculate click-count distribution over different time spans (Figure 1. Right ). The query logs were recorded in sequence of occurrence. Suppose that all these clicking actions happen during the time span [ T 0 ,T n ]. We calculate [ T 0 ,T n ], where T 0 &lt;T 1 &lt;T 2 &lt;...&lt;T n . The result is showninFigure1. Right . The high resemblance of all the curves implies that the SPE evidence is not merely a statistic overtheentirelog.
From a statistical perspective, to what extent an entry in a certain position impresses the users after searching can somewhat reveal the degree how the entry is attention-getting. Teevan studies the way people recall search results, and de-tects PE and RE on the first 10 entries [11, 12].
People may doubt that it seems not to accord with what has been reported by those major search engines. Is it only a special case caused by some biases in the specific search engines? Or by biases in the specific users? After carefully examining the previous work, we find it is actually a ubiq-uitous thing.

As an example, Figure 2 (cited from [3]) shows the click probability distribution computed upon the data of a sample of 7 million queries submitted to AltaVista (from Sep. 28, 2001 to Oct. 3, 2001). Similar to our observation, the click probability of the last 1 or 2 entries of the first page stands out. Such observation can also be found in other related papers [4, 5]. We consider that the reason of the inconspicu-ousness of the Serial Position Effect on the first page is that the SPE is concealed by the sharp attenuation of click ratio on the first 10 entries (this is confirmed by our experiment, with a result shown in Figure 5).

In our opinion, there may be two reasons that the SPE of the clicking behavior on result pages was not reported
Looking into the interaction between users and search en-gines, what brings about an effect in the clicking behavior? We summarize the factors as following: the potential quality of entries, the presentation of entries and the psychological states of users during the browsing process. The potential quality of a certain entry indicates the probability an aver-age user will click the entry after he/she checks it carefully. The presentation of entries generally determines the cost of effort (including scanning down the current page and turn-ing to the next page) that users should pay for accessing a certain entry. The serial position effects should also be taken into consideration, for these effects lead to an uneven distribution of attention users pay to the entries on the same page even though these entries are all viewed in sequence.
To characterize the click probability of entry which locates on the i th position of Page j , in some previous work [1, 3, 7], researchers only assume that
Wolf et al. take into consideration the falls in click ratio between consecutive pages [13]. They adopt a geometric function, which means exponential attenuation, to model these falls. However, it is inconsistent with what we have observed in our experiments. Their hypothetical model is ClickProb ( Entry i,j )= C  X  1
Based on the considerations on the previous subsection, we formalize a function to characterize the click probability of each entry where Q ( i, j ) denotes the quality of the entry ranked i + 10 j , SI ( i, j ) the impact of the effort of viewing the entries sequentially, NPI ( j ) the impact of the effort of turning over pages, and SPE ( i ) the relative intensity of the attention that an average user pays to the entry on Position i of a certain result page because of SPE. C is a normalization constant.
 According to the principle of least effort , we assume that have Zipf-like forms then we have ClickProb ( Entry i,j )= C  X  1
By curve fitting, we get SPE ( i )( i =1 , 2 ,..., 10) and the fitting curve for the log of August 2006 (Figure 3 and 4). The prominence of SPE (1) and SPE (10) shows the intensity of primacy and recency effects. There is a little inconsistency as SPE(4) stands out slightly. The reason is when searching with Sogou, users can only view the first 4 entries via a screen with 1024  X  768 resolution. This is another support instead of an opposition to our opinion.

To get a clear look on the effect of SPE, we deduce SPE ( i ) backwards from Equation (1):
The derived SPE on Position 1 to 90 is shown in Figure 5. The periodicity of the U-shaped feature confirms our viewpoint of SPE and the function we introduce to model the click probability distribution.
The complexity of the click probability function is deter-mined by the complexity of each factor that has an impact on the clicking behavior. In Section 4.3, while specializing SI ( i, j )and NPI ( j ) to be two simple elementary functions, there is a hidden hypothesis that people will generally check the entries in sequence, including both scanning the entries from top to down and turning pages one by one, without any jump. But it is not always the case, especially the page-turning actions after the 9th result page. Shown in Figure 6 is the click-count distribution on Position 61 to 500. Users tend to turn to those pages numbered j =5  X  k ( k =2 , 3 ,  X  X  X  ). This violation of the view-in-sequence assumption leads to the deviation of the click-count distribution. Even so, Func-tion (1) still stands and all the other parts of Function (2) are tenable except that we have to redefine the effort that users exert to access each entry (numbered after 90).
To say the least, the clicks on entries numbered after 90 only account for a very small portion of the total clicks (less than 2 . 5% in the log of Aug. 2006), and using Function (2) to estimate the click probability of each entry would almost lose nothing.
As shown above, the serial position effects have remark-ably deviated the click probability of the entries in the result pages of search engines. We should not blink this fact when making relevant analyses. Would it be better if the ranking of search results is adjusted according to SPE? For instance, is it more reasonable and profitable to exchange the posi-tions of No. 8 and No. 10?
