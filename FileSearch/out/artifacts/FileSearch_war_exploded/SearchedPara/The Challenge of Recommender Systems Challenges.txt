 Subsequently, other challenges have been organized, both by the industry 2 , as well as academia 3 , and today there are several challenges (large and small) organized on a yearly basis. This tutorial gives an insight into the organization of a challenge, from planning and preparation of data, to the execution and final evaluation of submitted approaches.
The tutorial is organized into three parts, each covering a different topic in the concept of recommender systems chal-lenges. In the first section (Introduction), an introduction to previous and current recommender systems challenges is given. Challenge-related topics are introduced and dis-cussed, e.g. datasets, evaluation details with specific focus on which type of aspects should be evaluated, e.g. The second part of the tutorial (Preparation, Execution &amp; Evaluation of a challenge) covers the practicalities involved in the process of organizing a challenge. Topics such a eval-uation types (offline vs. online), anonymization of data are discussed. In the final part of the tutorial (Conclusion) the concept of the recommender system challenge is revisited to sum up the most important aspects of the realization of a recommender systems challenge, e.g. benchmarking, data, user-centricity.

After the tutorial, a panel on recommender system chal-lenges is held to discuss relevant topics and answer any ques-tion from the audience.
The objectives of this tutorial is to elicit more interest in the concept of challenges, whether as an organizer or par-ticipant. Recommender systems challenges have undoubt-edly brought the related research forward. By organizing a challenge, any problem can be brought to light and entice interest among those who would have not approached the problem otherwise. http://overstockreclabprize.com e.g. the CAMRa Challenge http://www.camrachallenge. com or the ECML/PKDD Discovery Challenge -specifi-cally http://www.kde.cs.uni-kassel.de/ws/rsdc08/ and http://www.kde.cs.uni-kassel.de/ws/dc09/ Domonkos obtained his PhD in 2000 in computer science from Budapest University of Technology and Economics. He has been working on machine learning and data and text mining topics in the last decade. His team, Gravity, partici-pated at the Netflix Prize challenge, and was a leader of the The Ensemble team finished tied at the first position of the challenge. The team members founded the company Gravity to exploit the results achieved in Netflix Prize. Domonkos published actively in the field of recommender systems, co-authored about 20 papers in the last years. He also acted as the co-chair of at the recommender system related KDD-Cup 2007, RecsysChallange 2012 and RecSys Doctoral Sym-posium in 2011.

Andreas Hotho is a professor at the University of W  X urz-burg. He holds a Ph.D. from the University of Karlsruhe, where he worked from 1999 to 2004 at the Institute of Ap-plied Informatics and Formal Description Methods (AIFB) in the areas of text, data, and web mining, semantic web and information retrieval. He earned his Master X  X  Degree in information systems from the University of Braunschweig in 1998. From 2004 to 2009 he was a senior researcher at the University of Kassel. He joined the L3S in 2011. Since 2005 he has been leading the development of the social book-mark and publication sharing platform BibSonomy. An-dreas Hotho has published over 90 articles in journals and at conferences, co-edited several special issues and books, and co-chaired several workshops, e.g. the Workshop on Recom-mender Systems and the Social Web in 2011 and 2012 held in conjunction with ACM RecSys and the ECML PKDD Dis-covery Challenge in 2008 and 2009. He worked as a reviewer for journals and was a member of many international con-ferences and workshops program committees. His research focuses on the combination of data mining, information re-trieval and the semantic web. Further, he is interested in the analysis of social media systems, in particular folksonomies, tagging, and sensor data emerging trough ubiquitous and social activities. As the World Wide Web is one of his main application areas, his research contributes to the field of web science.
