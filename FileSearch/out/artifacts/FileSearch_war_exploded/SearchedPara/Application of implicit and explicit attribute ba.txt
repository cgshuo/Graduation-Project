Recommender systems use three main strategies to generate recommendations including content-based, collaborative, and e-learning environments focus on the correlations among users having similar interests. Combining several recommendation to deal with some of limitation and overcome drawbacks of pure content-based approach and pure collaborative approach by combining the two approaches.

An appropriate recommendation technique must be chosen according to pedagogical reasons. These pedagogical reasons are demands of lifelong learning than others. One way to implement pedagogical decisions into a recommender system is to use a variety of recommendation techniques in a recommendation strategy. The decision to change from one recommendation paper uses two recommendation techniques based on attributes of learners and resources and sequential patterns of resource accessing.
 resources; learner's rating information and time-variant multi-preferences of learner. Our proposed framework can use this of resource accessing to improve the accuracy of recommendations based on learning process. explicit attribute CF. Second, implement a time-variant approach for producing recommendations. Third, improve accuracy of and describing these attributes are impossible. Fourth, obtain more accurate recommendation based on the order of accessed resources in learning process.
 work. 2. Literature analysis
Recommender systems have been researched extensively by the Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) community during the both formal and informal learning [9]. Recommender system is one of the technologies that have been used for e-learning approach. 2.1. Content based fi ltering mining techniques for recommendation. CBR approach recommends new but similar items. However data mining techniques and Synonym Match. Then, the resources are further ranked based on number of weights.

In the existing content based recommendation algorithms, due to considering learner's preference information alone and not recommended. This causes overspecialized recommendations that only include items very similar to those the user already collaborative filtering and hybrid approaches mixing both techniques. 2.2. Collaborative fi ltering
Majority of researchers used collaborative filtering based recommendation system [11 data (rating matrix). In the demographics approach users with similar attributes are matched, then this method recommends items that are preferred by similar users. As an example in e-learning area, Bobadilla et al. [15] used a new equation for experiment showed that the method obtained high item-prediction accuracy.
 application domains, collaborative filtering has two serious drawbacks.

First, its applicability and quality is limited by the so-called sparsity problem, which occurs when the available data are techniques. Second, it requires knowing many user profiles in order to elaborate accurate recommendations for a given user.
Therefore, in some e-learning environments that number of learners is low; recommendation results do not have adequate they used Apriori Association Rule algorithm for recommender. Dwivedi and Bharadwaj [18] presented an approach that learner asks a resource rating query to his instant and distant friends through the social network and based on their query generated using a new similarity measure between the trees of learners. The experimental results show that their proposed method outperforms current algorithms and alleviates problems such as cold-start and sparsity. 2.3. Hybrid approach
To overcome drawbacks of these strategies, most of the researchers used a hybrid approach for resource recommendation [20  X  23]. Garc X a et al. [23] developed a specific Web mining tool for discovering suitable rules in recommender engine. Their objective was to be able to recommend to a student the most appropriate links/WebPages to visit next. Liang et al. [24] courseware selection module. At first, a user u enters keywords on the portal of courseware management system. Then, the courseware recommendation module finds within the same user interest group of user u the k courseware with the same or similar keywords that others choose. An appropriateness degree will be calculated for each k courseware by multiplying the recommendations. They implemented web usage mining techniques with content-based and collaborative filtering for computing relevant links to recommend to active learners. This approach doesn't use some of contextual information, such as rating information of learner and multi-attribute of learning resources. Kla server logs.

In summary, to adapt a recommendation approach for learning environment, we develop a framework for integrating some of this information in the resource recommendation process. 3. Methodology
We assume that the learning resources have been created using the converting and authoring tools by instructors and all the resources have been stored in a resource repository. Therefore, learners are able to view and rate the viewing resources.
The overall system architecture of the proposed e-learning recommender system is shown in Fig. 1 . In the offline mode, we period. Since the collected logs data contain many uninteresting elements (graphics, icons and etc.), they must first be e-learning system until he/she asks for recommendations. Two approaches, implicit and explicit collaborative filtering recommendation and sequential based recommendation, ar e used for producing two recommendation sets. Finally, two recommendation sets are combined for the final recommendation. 3.1. Collaborative based recommendation
The developments of implicit and explicit attribute based CF recommendation are described in this section. 3.1.1. Implicit collaborative based recommendation According to content-based assumption, user ratings on items are determined by the attributes of user and item corporately. recommendation process.
 as  X  =( M , U i , I j ), M is a prediction model learned from the historical rating data H ; U based on the limited observed attributes [26] .
 Let U I and I I denote implicit attribute space for users and items respectively. Let the vector U I  X  e I as  X   X  =( M , U i , I j , U i I , I j I ) the historical rating data could be converted to H neighborhood as a prediction model and also uses matri x factorization to discover implicit attributes.
In this research, we decompose rating matrix into two matrixes using the matrix factorization technique. In the attribute algorithm as a supervised learning task whose fitness function is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the RS. where r ij is the actual rating of item j by user i , w ik item j for user i can be calculated using implicit attributes as follows: 3.1.2. Explicit collaborative based recommendation the multidimensional attributes of educational resource must be considered.
 defined as a multidimensional vector M =[( AK 1 , AW 1 ),( AK attribute's name of resource, AW t denotes the appropriate weight value. In addition, we assume AW 1  X  m AW t =1.

Based on this description model, the attributes of a certain resource M denotes the t -th dimension attribute's keyword of resource M degree , 0.2),( Author 5, 0.15)]  X  . rating. Based on this theory, user participation often more or less follows a 90  X  90% of users are lurkers (i.e., read or observe, but don't contribute).  X  9% of users contribute from time to time, but other priorities dominate their time.  X  1% of users participate a lot and account for most contributions.

Rating of a learner can be determined in a number of ways. However the rating schema must precisely model the user's obtained.

In our rating schema, both access time-length of a resource and visiting frequency of a resource are used to estimate its reflects the relative importance of each resource, because a learner generally spends more time on a more useful learning according to these definitions as Eq. (5).
 where Nor is the normalization function. The scope of rating is set 1 proceeds in the system. MR ( L i , M j ) denotes rate of learner L factor somewhat.

However, in the existing vector-space based preference modeling methods, the dynamic changes of learner's preference are passage of time, the recommender system cannot produce the accurate recommendations. Herein, Gradual Forgetting Function introduce an exponential function, as follows: where x ( M j ) is the M j access order in the session of L access process going on and h ( x ) should be attenuated gradually. In h ( x ), rate of a learner's preference, and the bigger the  X  , the quicker the forgetting.
 term access. (3) In addition, the nonlinear function, h ( x ) supports the previous long term preference of learner. information and dynamic interest information, we can implement learner modeling.

LT combines multidimensional attributes of learner's accessed resources and learner's rating information to model multi-
In this tree, the leaf node which represents an accessed resource of L
MID indicates accessed resource ID, OR indicates current resource access order of learner L of h ( x ) for accessed resources of L i , and MR indicates the rating of L sample of which is shown in Fig. 3 . all nodes located in this path correspond to the relevant keywords of M resources and NH = 0.76 to the mathematics resources.

LT must be constructed for each learner and updated according to the following strategy: Search the keywords of the latest accessed resource attributes ( MA j =[ AK j 1 , AK j 2 ,..., AK i -th attribute cannot be matched, the m  X  i + 1 new node(s) with latter m updated NH , MR in the whole of tree. similarity between learners by calculating similarity degree between two rating vectors in learner recommended until some learners have taken the time to evaluate them. This problem is referred to as  X  cold start problem  X  also. (2) Most existing algorithms only consider the learner information of learner and attributes of resource. So, it will result to inaccurate results of similarity calculation.
To address these drawbacks, a new similarity measure is introduced based on learner's LT. As a logical assumption, two and accuracy of the recommendation. For defining similarity degree, three rules must be considered: (1) The more similar the attributes of learner L a and learner L (2) The more similar the order of accessed resources of learner L (3) The more similar the rating data of learner L a and learner L
Therefore, the similarity degree between two learners can be calculated based on the Attributes Subscription Vector ( ASV ) between their corresponding LTM . ASV between learner L a learner rating based similarity. The attribute based similarity sim on dynamic preferences simultaneously. Inspired by Cosine similarity, the calculation of sim where NH ai indicates the value of NH in the i -th level's matching for learner a . MW
Since MW i should increase with increasing depth, in this paper, it can be defined as MW similarity sim R ( L a , L b ) can be applied as follows: where L indicates the leaf node set of ASV ( L a , L b ). MR calculation of sim R ( L a , L b ) that computes similarity between MR values of nodes on LT data was modified.

Now we can calculate Collaborative Based Similarity (CBS) between L where  X  indicates the weight between sim R ( L a , L b ) and sim
Appropriateness Degree (AD) of resource M j for learner L where MR qj is rate of learner L q for resource M j , L M recommendation set of n resources according to a greater appropriateness degree. It must be noted that previously selected resources are excluded from the recommendation set.
 3.1.2.4. Time complexity analysis. In AD ( L i , M j ) calculation, according to formulas (7) need to consider item-based similarity calculation the similarity between L collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm. 3.2. Sequential based recommendation
E-learning systems have their own characteristics and simply transferring a recommender system from an existing 3.2.1. Mining sequential pattern using BIDE
Sequential pattern mining has received considerable attention among the researchers with broad applications. The sequential compared to the previous algorithms by using the BackSca n pruning method and the ScanSkip optimization technique.
In order to improve the efficiency of recommendation based on sequential patterns of resource accessing, we can apply a sequential pattern. Clustering approach can increase the scalability of recommendation that is an important problem in recommender systems. In addition, clustering can personalize recommendations and improve accuracy. By using collaborative and then gets recommendation using collaborative filtering. Since Learner Tree is updated in interaction with the learning can decrease computation cost in online and improve the scalability of system ( Fig. 5 ). 3.2.2. A recommendation mechanism using BIDE
In this section, a recommendation mechanism based on BIDE is developed. 3.2.2.1. Sliding window. To compute a recommendation set based on the discovered sequences for the current (active) learner is very important to maintain a historical depth for providing reasonable suggestions. a coefficient is defined as follows: resource, the interest of each resource is defined as follows: only when W ( M i ) and h ( x ) are both high. to predict the most possible resources which will be accessed in the future. Matching process is implemented on the sliding window of target learner ( SW w ) as prefix sequence. Assume that MS sequential pattern including SW w and also assume that the sequential pattern set with SW shows an illustrative example for learner's sliding window that is the prefix of a sequential pattern.
In this research, we combine tree rules in the calculation of recommendation score of candidate resources for each learner: (1) The more times M i appears in PS pos , the larger the recommendation score of this resource will be. (2) The more anterior M i appears in a sequential pattern, the larger the recommendation score of this resource will be. (3) The larger the ratio between support of sequential pattern s
Based on defined rules, the recommendation score M i for learner L sequential pattern without a corresponding prefix, and the pattern, where x denotes the resource's order in certain sequential pattern. Since based on rule (2) research we suppose  X  ( x )=exp(  X  x ).
 recommendation set. 3.3. Final recommendation
In order to improve the accuracy of recommendations in this research, at first, the results of the implicit and explicit CF recommendations are combined to make collaborative based recommendation (CBR), as shown below: where Nor ( x ) is a normalization function. Then, two recommendation sets including sequential-based recommendation (SBR) and CBR are combined through cascade approach. In other words, first we produce a primary recommendation list using CBR method. We select only items that their recommendation score calculated by Eq. (14) is more than the user defined value rank the primary recommendation list using SBR recommendation method and finally N -items with the highest recommendation score are chosen as the recommendation set. 4. Implication
In this section, we conduct several experiments to evaluate recommendation performance of the proposed recommendation model. Overall our experiments have verified the effectiveness of the proposed model in resource recommendation. 4.1. Experiment environment and data set All experiments in this paper were performed on DELL 1400 Vostro with Intel Pentium 1.6 GHz CPU and 1 GB RAM, and Windows 7 operating system. The algorithm is implemented by Matlab 2009.
 management system Moodle. In this environment, learners are responsible for their own learning pace and path [32]. The competence development.
 4.2. Evaluation metrics The experimental evaluation is based on two metrics: Precision and Recall defined as following: where p is the size of the user set, Rec ( U i ) denotes the recommendation set of user U (that must be recommended) and | TS ( U i )  X  Rec ( U i )| indicates the hits number of U 4.3. Performance evaluation the proposed approach, it is compared with vector space content-based recommendation algorithm [34], collaborative based recommendation algorithm [35] and improved hybrid recommendation algorithm [36]. In these comparisons, N denotes the number of recommendations; p denotes the number of participating users which are selected from the dataset to build an experiment dataset and G is number of neighborhoods. 4.3.1. Impact of parameters the optimal values of these parameters. Fig. 7 shows the impacts of obtained with  X  = 0.7. Fig. 7 B also indicates that combination of explicit and implicit CF can improve the accuracy of recommendation and the best results can be obtained with  X  to 8 while size of sliding widow, w varies from 2 to 6, N = 16, p = 300 and G = 10.
 recommender and precision of results, we consider C = 4. 4.3.2. Comparative study dynamic learners' preference and the resource's attributes are taken into account based on traditional collaborative-based mechanism. Since neighbors aren't used by the SBR method to generate recommendation, this method is not sensitive to G .
In the second comparison experiment, the precision of recommendation algorithms is compared with respect to N while p =300 always produces better performance than other algorithms, especially when N is small because during the changing process, candidate resources much more efficiently.
 running time of the proposed and improved hybrid recommendation algorithms are a little larger than collaborative based cost the largest running time. Therefore, there is a trade-off between algorithm running time and recommendation precision when choosing the proposed recommendation algorithm.

In the fourth comparison experiment, the recall of recommendation algorithms is compared with respect to p while N =16 According these experiments, the proposed recommendation has higher precision and recall in most cases. 5. Conclusion
Personalized recommendations are used to support learning of users in the learning environments. However, there are several drawbacks when applying the existing recommendation algorithms. To address these drawbacks in this paper, we proposed a new first approach, Collaborative Based Recommendation, Learner Tree was introduced to consider multi-dimensional attributes of find sequential patterns in accessing of materials for recommendation. The experiment results show that our algorithm can real-time up dated contextual information.

Since in e-learning environments as logical assumption learners with greater knowledge have to be more important in the approach that can take into account the knowledge of a learner and extend the existent equations of recommendation.
