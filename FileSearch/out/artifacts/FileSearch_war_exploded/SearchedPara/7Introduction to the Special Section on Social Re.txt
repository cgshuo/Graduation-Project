 Social Recommender Systems (SRSs), a class of recommender systems that target the social media domain, continue to proliferate and help users to cope with the ever-growing  X  X ocial overload X  [Guy and Carmel 2011]. Social media websites have become more dependent on their ability to provide effective recommendations, while users of sites such as YouTube or Amazon are becoming more accustomed to surfing via recommendations than via more traditional techniques [Guy et al. 2010]. On the other hand, the social Web continues to evolve, to grow in volume, and to offer new data to feed recommender analysis and shape the future of recommender systems [Jannach et al. 2010; Ricci et al. 2010].

This special section is the continuation of the first special issue published in 2011 [Guy et al. 2011]. It includes five new articles that cover advanced topics in SRSs, including new application domains, such as recommendation for groups or for mobile users, and new data types, such as tag preferences, negative ratings, group  X  X ersonal-ity X , and reviews in Chinese. It also includes work that addresses emerging challenges such as the inference of virtual ratings, the generation of path-based explanations, the implicit extraction of tag preferences, and the combination of location-based data with user preferences.

More specifically, the first article by Quijano-Sanchez et al. suggests a method for group recommendation that incorporates group personality and trust between group members into a collaborative filtering process. Evaluation is performed in the movie domain, using social network data from Facebook and Tuenti, a popular social network site in Spain.

In the second article, Zhang et al. use sentiment analysis to derive virtual ratings from user reviews in Chinese on Youku, Youtube X  X  counterpart in China. The virtual rat-ings are then fused into item-based and user-based collaborative filtering algorithms. Their evaluation compares the virtual ratings with  X  X eal X  ratings as they appear on the book section of Amazon.

The third entry by Biancalana et al. explores the recommendation of points of interest to mobile users, based on the combination of contextual data, such as location or weather, with user preferences. Their system, called Polar, is compared with non-personalized location-aware recommender systems.

In the fourth article, Gedikli and Jannach explore how tag preferences, incorporating item-specific ratings for tags, can be used to improve recommendation accuracy. This approach allows users to evaluate an item in various dimensions, which are not static or predefined. They also propose a method for automatically deriving user-specific and item-specific tag preferences from the overall ratings, when tag preference data is not explicitly given.

In the fifth article, Chen et al. present a random-walk model that can handle both positive and negative comments with the guarantee of convergence. They also propose a method for generating graph-based explanations by backtracking the effective paths in the graph.

The following table summarizes the five articles in this special section, by the recom-mended entities, the data used as the basis for recommendation, and the social media systems or datasets used for experimentation.
