 1. Introduction
The  X  X emantic gap X , i.e. the discrepancy between the limited descriptive power of the low-level image features and the richness of the user X  X  interpretation of the same image, has been in the focus of the image retrieval research for the last decade. Most of the approaches use keywords that eit her correspond to identifiable items describing the visual content of an image or relate to the context and the interpretation of that image. The user may be searching for an image of something (e.g.  X  X apanese garden X ) or  X  X  X n image about something X  X  (e.g.  X  X ap anese philosophy X ). Advances in image analysis, object detection and classification techniques may facilitate the automatic extraction of keywords which describe identifiable entities like a garden. However, keywords belonging to the second category are unlikely to be automatically obtained from images ( Liu et al., 2007 ; Ferecatu et al., 2008 ), because, from the point of view of feature representation, there is no single visual feature, which best describes the image content ( Tsai, 2007 ).
A particular challenging aspect in this context is dealing with concepts which have no visual appearance in the images (e.g.  X  X ntellectual curiosity X ). This includes concepts related to categories such as time, space, events and their significance, as well as abstract terms and emotions ( Enser et al., 2007 ). Such concepts could be extracted from annotations or the text complementing the image.
This paper proposes an unsupervised concept-based image index-ing technique which uses a lexical ontology to extract a semantic signature called  X  X emantic chromo some X  from an image annotation.
Central to this technique is the de veloped concept disambiguation algorithm which identifies the most relevant concept(s) or the  X  X emantic DNA X  (SDNA) by measuring the semantic importance of each word/phrase in the annotation . Although this paper only focuses on image retrieval, the proposed approach is also applicable to any resources which contain text description including audio, video, multimedia content, speech, technical documents and web sites.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes recent work in semantic indexing of images and semantic systems evaluation. Section 3 introduces the concept of SDNA, and the lexical ontology used in this research, and describes the indexing technique developed. Its evaluation is presented in Section 4 . Section 5 concludes the paper by suggest-ing directions for further research. 2. Literature review 2.1. Semantic indexing of images
Traditional text-based image re trieval systems predominantly employ indexing techniques which use keywords occurrences to identify important terms in anno tations and the text accompanying images. The keywords used to in dex the images are normally weighted to indicate their relative importance. Several weighting functions have been proposed including statistical factors such as term frequency (TF), inverse docum ent frequency (IDF), the product of TF and IDF (TF-IDF), and document length normalization ( Salton and McGill, 1983 ; Salton and Buckley, 1988 ; Fuhr and Buckley, 1991 ; Lee, 1995 ). However, most keyword-based indexing methods do not consider the semantic context of the documents/annotations.
The relationship between words and concepts is considered a complex issue due to the use of synonyms ( X  X ifferent words, same meaning X ) and homonyms ( X  X ame word, different meaning X ).
An alternative approach is offered by the content-based image retrieval (CBIR) community who use image processing techniques to extract low-level image features and means for semantic interpretation of these features. However, the use of visual features on their own does not solve the problem of the semantic gap, i.e. the discrepancy between the low-level features contained in an image and its high level description that is meaningful to the human mind ( Smeulders et al., 2000 , Boujemaa et al., 2001 ).
A number of researchers work on narrowing down the semantic gap by combining CBIR with high-level semantics using various techniques including ontology associations ( Mezaris et al., 2003 ,
Ren et al., 2003 ), supervised and unsupervised machine learning ( Chen et al., 2003 ; Vasconcelos, 2004 ) and relevance feedback ( Lu et al., 2000 ; Doulamis and Doulamis, 2004 ). Eugenio et al., (2002) use low-level features and provide a semantic representa-tion of the images based on combination of geometric shapes.
Other approaches use semantic templates ( Chang et al., 1998 ) and textual information on the Web to support high level image retrieval ( Feng et al., 2004 ).

Concept-based image retrieval is an alternative approach that combines text document retrieval with semantic technologies to analyze the annotation or text surrounding the image, and extract high level concepts. Instead of using keywords only, it represents both the image and the query using these concepts, and performs retrieval in the concept space. The use of high-level concepts as dimensions in a vector space model reduces the dependency on specific terms used in the annotation and the query, which yields to a better retrieval performance ( Styltsvig, 2006 ). This approach is capable of producing good results even when different words are used in the query and text annotation to communicate the same meaning. This also solves the synonymy and homonymy problem and increases recall. Similarly, if the correct concept is extracted to represent a polysemic word, non-relevant results could be eliminated which also increases precision.

In concept-based image retrieval, concepts are mapped to an existing knowledge base, which is populated with real-life con-cepts understandable by humans ( Voorhees and Harman 1999 ;
Gauch et al., 2003 ). Alternatively, concepts can be automatically generated based on overlapping relations between terms or probabilities of term occurrences, which are not necessarily interpretable by humans ( Hofmann, 1999 ; Yi and Allan, 2009 ).
The former approach is preferable as it is better aligned with human understanding which is the most important aspect in narrowing the semantic gap.

In recent years, the use of semantic technologies and metadata languages has expanded as they offer means for defining class terminologies with well-defined semantics and flexible data models for representing metadata descriptions ( Hyv  X  onen et al., 2002 ). In particular, controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, free text descriptions and annotations are employed to describe or classify the images in order to improve the retrieval. Other approaches rely on the use of ontologies to provide different views for navigation, and terminology for creating the metadata or the annotations of the images ( Hyv  X  onen et al., 2002 ; Dill et al., 2003 ; Zhang et al., 2006 ; Staab et al., 2008 ). It must be noted, however, that different ontologies may not have the same degree of formality. Controlled vocabularies, dictionaries, thesauri, and taxonomies are some of the most lightweight ontology types widely used in annotations. These forms of vocabularies are not strictly formal and the annotations produced using them are normally pointers to terms in the vocabulary, which can be used to improve the search by using synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms and hypernyms. 2.2. Evaluation of semantic systems
Evaluating the relevancy of the retrieved results is a difficult and expensive task due to the use of different test sets, linguistic inventories and knowledge resources. Most of the systems are evaluated using in-house, mostly small-scale, data sets.
Competitions like Senseval ( Edmonds, 2002 ) and Semeval provide common grounds for comparative evaluation of word sense disambiguation and semantic analysis of text. However, although they are the best reference to study the recent devel-opments in the area, it is difficult to use the data sets provided because of the different dictionaries adopted for the ground truth creation (i.e. HECTOR, WordNet 1.7, WordNet 1.7.1 and WordNet 2.1). Furthermore, the subjectivity in perceiving and interpreting visual content makes it difficult to determine what is considered relevant in the context of a specific query. A set of query results may or may not be relevant to different people, depending on their personal understanding. Currently, there are no publicly available semantic datasets that represent the  X  X round truth X  and could be used as an evaluation benchmark.

A recently emerged evaluation method is based on using crowdsourcing as a means for collective human judgment ( Snow et al., 2008 ; Alonso and Mizzaro, 2009 ; Akkaya et al., 2010 ). The word  X  X rowdsourcing X  introduced by Jeff Howe (2006) describes  X  X  X he act of company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call X  X . In crowdsourcing, a large task is divided into smaller tasks which are then distributed among a large group of people who do not necessarily know each other. Crowdsourcing normally involves payment in exchange of the task being performed.
The cost, speed and quality of the crowdsourcing results are reported by many researchers to be impressive ( Snow et al., 2008 ; Akkaya et al., 2010 ; Corney et al., 2010 ). Although spammers are the main concern in crowdsourcing, Akkaya et al. (2010) have found that their input is minimal and the results are highly reliable. Another experimental study by Corney et. al. (2010) concludes that, with the right question and enough information, crowdsourcing can provide high quality results. Their crowdsour-cing approach applied to a two-dimensional strip packing task demonstrates a better efficiency rate than the best algorithm available in the literature. These findings are consistent with the study by Snow et al. (2008) of the evaluation of experts and non-expert conducting five natural language processing tasks. The study has found that in average only four non-experts answers are needed to emulate an expert opinion. Callison-Burch (2009) also shows that a non-expert group produces judgments that are similar to those of experts. The evaluation results produced in this study have a stronger correlation than the Bleu algorithm ( Papineni et al., 2002 ) which approximates human judgment in evaluating machine translation.

This paper further advances the state of the art in the field of image retrieval by proposing a novel concept-based retrieval approach, which automatically maps image annotations to high level concepts contained in a comprehensive lexical ontology. The approach is evaluated using crowdsourcing.
 3. Semantic DNA and semantic chromosomes 3.1. Definitions
Owners of professional collections of photographs provide a large amount of keywords in an attempt to make their photo-graphs easier to find by those looking for images to illustrate books, develop web sites, and create visual designs. Most annota-tions manually added to images are: a. descriptive text, brief explanation, or comments used to label the image, (e.g.  X  X  X  tea ceremony at a garden in the center of
Tokyo X  X ), b. metadata in the form of free keywords (e.g.  X  X  X ea ceremony, drinking tea, Japanese way of life, Japanese tradition, tea garden, water, rocks, bridge, island, sado X  X ), c. controlled vocabulary to make the categorization easier (e.g.  X  X  X ulture X  X ,  X  X  X apan X  X ,  X  X  X ourism X  X ,  X  X  X arden X  X ) or/and d. database information (e.g. date, title, name of the photogra-pher who has taken the picture).

The approach in this paper uses image annotations to extract the semantic signature of each image in a collection. The semantic signature, called in this research semantic chromosome, is com-posed of a number of semantic DNA.

Scientists use the concepts of DNA and chromosomes to describe the organization of genetic information in living organ-isms. Following the same analogy, a semantic chromosome is defined in this research as an information structure, which carries the semantic information of an image. It is its semantic signature expressed through a set of semantic DNA (SDNA), where each
SDNA in the set representing one semantically distinguishable concept.

For example, an image depicting a tea house in a Japanese traditional garden might be represented through a set of concepts such as  X  X ea garden X ,  X  X apan X ,  X  X radition X  and  X  X eremony X . Each of these four words represents a semantically distinguishable concept. Used together (and represented in a coded way), they form the semantic signature or the semantic chromosome of this image and could be used to represent its meaning.

Although a semantic chromosome may look like an annota-tion, it is very different as it is a formal representation of the semantic meaning of that image. This means that the semantic chromosome is extracted in a formal way, using terminology with well defined semantics, and is linked to some semantic resources. In particular, the use of ontologies is very beneficial as ontologies nowadays are the only widely accepted paradigm for the management of sharable and reusable knowledge in a way that allows its automatic interpretation. In the context of this research, the use of ontologies provides some formalization of the content as a prerequisite for more comprehensive indexing, retrieval and use. 3.2. OntoRo
The ontology used in this research is OntoRo , a lexical ontology built using the electronic version of the Roget X  X  Thesaurus ( Hart and Newby, 2003 ) and employed in the development of two other concept tagging algorithms ( Setchi and Tang, 2007 ; Setchi et al., 2010). The Roget X  X  Thesaurus ( Davidson, 2003 ) is a well known resource mainly used to facilitate the expression of ideas and assist in literacy composition. In information retrieval it is employed to expand search items with other closely related words. Different from a dictionary which explains the meaning of words, Roget X  X  groups words based on ideas and their semantic similarity. It has a well established structure, where the words/ phrases are grouped and linked by their meaning and associations.

The current version of OntoRo, also available as a web applica-tion ( OntoRo, 2011 ), includes 68,920 unique words and 228, 130 entries classified into 6 classes, 39 sections, 95 subsections, 990 heads, 4 part-of-speech (POS) categories and a number of paragraphs within each concept. Monosemic words, which have a single sense, appear in one concept only. Most of the words however are polysemic, have several meanings and are linked to a corresponding number of concepts. (This example also explains why OntoRo contains 68,920 unique words and many more entries: 228,130.) For example, the word  X  X radition X  has 6 senses and is related to 6 OntoRo concepts representing the meaning of tradition as something from the past (#127: oldness), lasting quality (#144: permanence), means of sharing information (#524: information), statement of facts (#590: description), habit or second nature (#610: habit) and religious faith (#973: religion). In this paper, each of the 990 concepts (called head groups in Roget X  X ) is labeled through its number in OntoRo and the first word in the list of all words and phrases belonging to that concept. For example, the concept #127: oldness is represented in OntoRo with 233 words, some of which are shown in the Box 1 below.

It is clear that all these words can be used to describe different aspects of  X  X ldness X . Most of them are related to history and mythology but there are clear connotations to decline, decay, and aging, and some not entirely expected negative associations and comparisons (e.g.  X  X ld fossil X  and  X  X oth-eaten X ). It is clear, how-ever, that this particular sense of the word  X  X radition X  would be inappropriate to use in relation to an image of a traditional Japanese garden.

Paragraphs in OntoRo are further divided into POS categories and sub paragraphs which group words with closer relationships in term of contextual meaning.

This example shows that the semantic signature of an image should be a more complex and meaningful structure than a list of words if it were to be used for indexing and information retrieval. Box 1 oldness, primitiveness, beginning, y , antiquity, maturity, mellowness, autumn, decline, rust, decay, senility, old age, eldership, seniority, archaism, antiquities, y , thing of the past, relic of the past, listed building, ancient monument, museum piece, antique, heirloom, bygone, Victoriana, dodo, dinosaur, fossil, oldie, golden, old fogy, old fossil, tradition, lore, folklore, mythology, inveteracy, custom, pre-scription, y vintage, venerable, patriarchal, archaic, ancient, timeworn, ruined, prehistoric, mythological, heroic, classic, Hellenic, Byzantine, feudal, medieval, y , historical, past, geological, pre-glacial, fossil, Paleozoic, secular, Eolithic, Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, y , ancestral, traditional, time-honored, habitual, y , old as the hills, y , old as history, old as time, age-old, lasting, antiquated, of other times, of another age, y , prior, anachronistic, archaistic, archaizing, retrospective, fossilized, ossified, static, permanent, behind the times, out of date, out of fashion, dated, y , conservative, Victorian, old-fashioned, old-school, y , outdated, outmoded, old hat, gone by, past, decayed, perished, dilapidated, rusty, moth-eaten, crumbling, mildewed, moss-grown, moldering, decomposed, fusty, y , belong to the past, have had its day, be burnt out, end, age, grow old, decline, fade, y , rot, rust, decay, decompose, anciently, since the world was made,.., before the Flood, formerly (233 words in total, not all are included in this box)
The next section shows how semantic chromosomes are con-structed using semantic DNA. 3.3. Semantic chromosomes
As already mentioned, a semantic chromosome is defined as the semantic signature of an image, e xpressed through a set of SDNA, each representing a semantically distinguishable concept. Each
SDNA is formally represented as a chain of numbers corresponding to the structural elements of the OntoRo X  shierarchy. The format of a SDNA is as follows:
Class #  X  Section #  X  Sub-section #  X  Head #  X  Label for POS
For example, a suitable sense for the word  X  X radition X  in an image annotation of a Japanese garden would be  X  X asting quality X  (belonging to concept #144: permanence); its SDNA is 1-7-24-144-1-1. Its semantic representation, following the SDNA format (i.e. OntoRo X  X  hierarchical structure), is shown in Fig. 1 , where 1is used to show the POS group of the word, i.e. noun.

Each SDNA carries semantic information including part of speech, high level concept name, context meaning and points to other words that can be used in the same context. These words are not always synonyms; they are related words that can be used to express the same idea or concept.

Table 1 lists all SDNA corresponding to each contextual mean-ing of the word  X  X radition X . Only one of these SDNA is meaningful within a certain context for a given image, and only it will be included in the semantic chromosome of that image. The selec-tion of the most meaningful SDNA and their use to index images is explained in the next section. 3.4. Semantic DNA indexing
Fig. 2 shows the conceptual model of the SDNA indexing approach proposed by the authors in an earlier publication ( Fadzli and Setchi, 2010 , 2011 ). The formal representation of the semantic indexing algorithm is outlined below.

Given an image annotation, a , the approach involves four processes: i. Parsing the text of the annotation and removing punctuations ii. Mapping the keywords in the annotation to a lexical ontology. iii. Extracting the SDNA, s i , of each term using the ontology iv. Weighting each SDNA, s i , and disambiguating them to select The image in Fig. 3 will be used to illustrate the algorithm. The annotation of the image contains 18 keywords/phrases and all of them have been identified in step ii as relevant (i.e. they all exist in the lexical ontology). Table A.1 (see Appendix) lists all SDNA related to each of these terms, as extracted in step iii.
In step iv, each SDNA is weighted using reverse Hamming distance (RHD) by measuring the similarity between any two
SDNA, s i and s j : sim  X  s , s j  X  X  L hamming _ distance  X  s i , s j  X  X  1  X  where L is the total number of levels used in the SDNA, which is 6.
For example, the si milarity between s 8 :2-10-35-209-1-4 (one of the senses of  X  X emple X ) and s 14 : 2-10-36-226-1-10 (one of the senses of
Japan) is 2. The total similarity for each SDNA is then calculated by cumulating the similarities between it and all other strings of SDNA: totalsim  X  s i  X  X  where 9 s 9 is the total number of SDNA extracted from all terms (132 in this case, see Table A.1). A normalization method based on Okapi
BM25 model ( Robertson et al., 1999 ) integrated with information content (IC) is used to balance the SDNA weight, sw() ,whenhaving annotations with d ifferent length:
SW  X  s
 X  X  where IC(s i ) is the information content of SDNA s i obtained by dividing the number of images in the collection containing this
SDNA by the total number of images in the collection, and taking the negative logarithm of the quotient. k and b are two tuning parameters which are adjustable according to the requirements of the specific application. k is a positive parameter that calibrates the document frequency scaling. A k value of 0 corresponds to a binary model with no term frequency, and a large value corresponds to using raw term frequency. b is another tuning parameter which determines the scaling by document length, where b  X  (0, y yields to fully scaling the term weight by the document length, while b  X  0 yields to no document length normalization. The values of k  X  9and b  X  0.75 have been used in this example.

Table 2 lists SDNA related to every possible sense of term t : X  X olden X  and t 2 : X  X emple X  and the computed values for total sim , IC and SW . As shown, the term  X  X olden X  has 5 senses, while  X  X emple X  has 8. Based on the SW values, s 2 : yellow and s 7 : house are selected as the most accurate SDNA which represent t 1 and t 2 . Table A.2 (see the Appendix) lists all selected SDNA for Fig. 3 . Related words from OntoRo are also included to help the understanding of the context of each sense. The selected SDNA form the semantic chromosome of the image (Table A.2). It is  X  X  X ellow, house, blacken, farness, land travel, structure, wooden, tomb, public worship, reputable, theology, cultivate, euphoria, cultivate, land, posterity, place, land travel X  X . It can be seen that it adequately represents the contextual meaning of the image using high level concepts. In addition, as mentioned earlier, the chromosome can be used as a pointer to a great number of semantically related words and phrases which can be used to match a search query with images.

The SDNA disambiguation algorithm is crucial in this approach as it influences the performance of the indexing and retrieval process. Selecting the correct sense for each keyword could eliminate non-relevant results in the retrieval process, thus increasing precision. The performance of the SDNA disambigua-tion algorithm proposed is evaluated in the next section. 4. SDNA disambiguation evaluation 4.1. Materials
Research collaboration with VisconPro Ltd. has provided this study with 157,639 digital images. VisconPro Ltd. is one of the UK leading online companies which hosts an image stock website called fotoLIBRA &amp; ( VisconPro, 2011 ). The website currently hosts 392,728 high quality images covering a broad range of topics. The images, owned by more than 20,000 photographers, have already been manually annotated by them.

The evaluation used in this study is based on collective human evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The evalua-tion tasks are divided into micro-tasks which are offered to a large number of people who do not know each other. Every task offered through the MTurk is called a human intelligence task (HIT). The people who perform the task are called workers. They are paid according to the number of HITs they had completed. 4.2. Evaluation protocol
The main objective of the evaluation is to measure the accuracy of the proposed SDNA disambiguation algorithm in selecting the most accurate sense for each term in an annotation.
The experiment includes two tasks which are conducted by different groups of workers.

In Task 1, the workers are given a group of words from an image annotation ( Fig. 4 ). They are asked to consider the context of these words and select the most accurate sense for each of them. Three keywords with the highest SDNA weight are chosen to be scored by the workers. For each keyword, the worker is provided with two choices: (i) the sense selected by the proposed approach and (ii) a randomly selected sense from all other possible senses. In addition, a list of related words is also provided to help the workers understand the meaning of each sense.
The workers are also offered  X  X ll of the above X  choice, if they agree with both senses given, and  X  X one of the above X  choice if they do not agree with neither senses. Table 3 lists the scores for each choice selected by the user.

To observe the statistical relationship between the SDNA disambiguation score from Task 1 and the accuracy of the annotations, a second task is designed ( Fig. 5 ) which measures the accuracy of each annotation according to the image context.
In Task 2, the workers are provided with an image together with its annotation. Based on the image, the workers are asked to rate the accuracy of the annotation given, from  X  X ot accurate X  to  X  X ery accurate X . Table 4 lists the scores for each category.
The main challenge in using MTurk services is to filter out low-quality results from irresponsible and careless workers. In order to help managing worker X  X  accuracy, MTurk provides the ability to review the HITs results prior to approving or rejecting HITs submis-sions. Any answers such as identical answers for different HITs, completing time that is less than 30 s per task (which is considered too fast), and incomplete answer, are rejected without any payment made. This affects the workers approval rate which indicates theirs reliability for performing future tasks. By restricting the workers approval rate to a certain threshold, requesters can make sure that workers with bad reputation are not able to accept their tasks. 4.3. Evaluation results
In Task 1, 500 images with their annotations were randomly selected from the collection for evaluation. A total of 5000 HITs were offered with payment of USD 0.02 per HIT. Each HIT was scored by 10 different workers. This is consistent with the experiment conducted by Snow et al. (2008) which involved a word sense disambiguation task. 203 workers accepted the tasks; each of them completed in average 24.6 HITs. A HIT took an average of 54.09 s to complete. During the review of the results, 263 HITs were rejected because of unreliable answers. These HITS were offered to other workers.

For each image, three keywords were considered resulting in a total of 1500 keywords for the 500 images selected for evaluation. Table 5 and Fig. 6 show the scoring for 1500 words in task 1. Column  X  X core X  shows the ratio of  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  scores, where the number preceding the  X  X  X  letter indicates the number of workers who agree with the proposed sense, while the number preceding the letter  X  X  X  indicates the number of workers who disagree with the proposed sense. For example, a category  X 7Y 3N X  includes 7  X  X  X  and 3  X  X  X  votes; 18.1% of all keywords (272 keywords) belong to this category.
For every keyword evaluated in a HIT, a simple majority score from 10 workers is taken as the final score. A majority score is defined as at least 6 out of 10 workers in agreement. Therefore, for the 1500 keywords considered in this experiment, 1191 keywords (79.4%) have a majority score of 1, with only 253 keywords (16.9%) having a majority score of 0. In other words, 79.4% of the senses proposed by the approach are agreed by the workers with a majority score, which indicates the accuracy of the SDNA disambiguation algorithm proposed.

This result of 79.4% demonstrated by the proposed approach is far better than the 73% accuracy achieved in the Semeval 2007 competition, which compared the accuracy of various unsuper-vised algorithms where the participants have been using Word-Net as a lexicon ( Navigli, 2009 ). It is also comparable with the accuracy achieved in the same competition (82 X 83%) by the supervised algorithms which contrary to the approach proposed in this paper have to be trained with large corpora.

In task 2, a subset of 50 images from the 500 images used in task 1 was selected for evaluation. Using the same approach, each image annotation was scored by 10 different workers. A total of 500 HITs were offered with payment of USD 0.02 per HIT. A total of 47 workers accepted the tasks; in average each of them completed 10.6 HITs. An average score from 10 workers is taken as the final score for each image annotation. Table 6 shows the average score for the 50 images considered.

Fig. 7 shows examples of images with (a) high annotation accuracy and (b) low annotation accuracy. The annotation of the first image ( Fig. 7 a) has a high average annotation accuracy of 2.7 as its annotation contains words that could easily be asso-ciated with objects in the picture. The annotation of the second image ( Fig. 7 b) has a low average annotation accuracy score of 1.3 as it contains lots of irrelevant words such as customs, society, earthwork, horizontal, windmill, beaker, horseshoe, igneous and heel . To find the statistical correlation between the accuracy of the
SDNA disambiguation algorithm and the accuracy of the annota-tions, Pearson X  X  correlation was computed on the basis of the 50 images used in task 2. Fig. 8 shows the correlation graph between the average SDNA disambiguation score and average annotation score.
 0 50 100 150 200 250 300
The analysis shows a positive correlation value of 0.5779 between the average SDNA disambiguation score and the average annotation accuracy score which suggests that there is a positive relationship between the quality of the image annotations and the quality of the SDNA disambiguation result proposed by this approach. In other words, the approach selects an accurate sense for each keyword when the annotation accuracy is high. As one may expect, lower quality annotations make it hard for the approach to propose the correct sense for each keyword. For example, the result from the disambiguation of the annotation of the image in Fig. 7 a scored 2.7 while the corresponding score for the one shown in Fig. 7 b is 1.3. 5. Comparison with previous work
The concept-based in dexing approach proposed in this paper is based on previous research conduc ted within an EU-funded project called TRENDS ( Setchi and Bouchard, 2010 , Setchi et al., 2011 ). The approach tags images with a ranked set of concept numbers extracted by analyzing web conte nt (i.e. the text surrounding the images). The TRENDS algorithm uses concepts from two ontologies: a generic lexical ontology called OntoRo and a domain-specific ontology for designers called Conjoint Trend Analysis (CTA). The weight of the concepts in TRENDS is calculated using (3): w where w ck  X  d j  X  is the weight of a concept c k in a document d exists in the CTA ontology) or 1 (if the concept is not domain-specific and therefore not part of the CTA ontology), w tf-idf (t i weight of a term t i in a document d j ,and C k (t i ) is the number of concepts C k the term t i is related to.

The algorithm is reported to demonstrate good performance in semantic-based retrieval and higher precision in concept search compared to traditional keyword-based retrieval. However, it was originally formulated for long text documents dealing with hun-dreds of concepts per document. Based on empirical evidence, the algorithm is considerably less efficient when dealing with short texts such as image annotations. The lack of word disambiguation function and the extensive use of tf-idf weighting have lead to irrelevant concept numbers being tagged to images, producing a lot of noise in the index table. Further analysis shows that C has a high impact on the concept weights as any concept related to terms which are less ambiguous (i.e. have a small number of senses) will most probably get high weighting.

For example, consider Fig. 3 and its annotation. It contains 18 unique terms including words and phrases. Most terms are polysemic (i.e. they have more than one possible meaning) and are linked to a number of ontological concepts. Table 7 lists all Average Annotation Score concept numbers related to these terms. For example, the word  X  X emple X  is linked to seven concept numbers because it is semantically related to the concept of production (concept number #164), abode (#192), height (#209), summit (#213), refuge (#662), repute (#866) and temple (#990). The word  X  X ater X  is related to 21 different concepts while the named entity  X  X ar East X  is related to only 1 concept.

Table 8 lists the concepts with the highest ranking computed using formula (3). For the purposes of this example, the CTA coefficient is ignored as it has been used in the TRENDS project to highlight the importance of some high-impact semantic adjec-tives for the designers of concept cars.

The analysis shows that concept #199 is ranked as the highest weighted concept as result of being the only concept linked to the term  X  X ar East X . The low value of C k (t i ) makes a high impact on the weight of the concept. Concept #199, named  X  distance X  , contains 219 related terms as listed below: distance, astronomical distance, light years, depths of space, space, measured distance, mileage, food miles, footage, length, focal distance, elongation, greatest elongation, aphelion, apogee, far distance, horizon, false horizon, skyline, offing, background, rear, periphery, circumference, outline, drift, dispersion, deviation, reach, grasp, compass, span, stride, giant X  X  stride, range, far cry, long way, fair way, tidy step, day X  X  march, long long trail, marathon, farness, far distance, remoteness, aloofness, removal, separation, antipodes, pole, contraposition, world X  X  end, ends of the earth, Pillars of Hercules, ne plus ultra, back of beyond, Far
West, Far East, foreign parts, extraneousness, outpost, seclusion, purlieus, outskirts, exteriority, outer edge, frontier, limit, unavailability, absence.

This concept which represents the idea of being in a distant or remote area is hardly the strongest concept to be associated with the annotation context. The second highest concept #866:repute is also the only concept associated with the monosemic word  X  historic  X . The next three concepts in the ranked list (#990:temple, #364:interment and #988:ritual) are all related to the term  X  shrine  X  which has the second highest tf-idf value. Although these t hree concepts indicate three different meanings of the term  X  shrine X  , they are all being tagged as important concepts for the image regardless of the actual context.
This example shows the need for conc ept disambiguation, especially when dealing with annotations or short texts.

An experiment using 5000 random image annotations from the fotoLIBRA &amp; dataset reveals that 80.9% of the highest ranked concepts being tagged using the TRENDS algorithm are linked to terms with less than two senses ( C k (t i ) o  X  2). This result shows that, when dealing with short texts, the TRENDS algorithm is biased towards monosemic terms, regardless of the semantic context of the text.
The concept senses tagged by the p roposed algorithm to the same image example are shown in Table 9 . The highest weighted SDNA, 3-15-47-370-1-2 is selected from 10 different senses of the term  X  X arden X . This SDNA represents the idea of botanical farm or flora garden. It is semantically associated with the 124 terms listed below: cultivate, bring under cultivation, make fruitful, farm, ranch, garden, grow, till, till the soil, scratch the soil, dig, double-dig, trench, bastard trench, delve, spade, dibble, seed, sow, broadcast, scatter the seed, set, plant, prick out, dibble in, puddle in, transplant, plant out, bed, plough, disk, harrow, rake, hoe, weed, prune, top and lop, thin out, deadhead, shorten, graft, engraft, implant, layer, take cuttings, force, vernalize, fertilize, top dress, mulch, dung, manure, invigorate, grass over, sod, rotate the crop, leave fallow, not use, harvest, gather in, store, glean, reap, mow, cut, scythe, cut a swathe, bind, bale, stook, sheaf, flail, thresh, winnow, sift, bolt, separate, crop, pluck, pick, gather, tread out the grapes, ensile, ensilage, improve one X  X  land, make better, fence in, enclose, ditch, drain, reclaim, water, irrigate.
This paper proposes an approach to sense disambiguation which is based on calculating the occurrences of each concept sense. The SDNA strings tagged to the image carries rich semantic information linked to the high level concepts represented in the annotation. Unlike the TRENDS algorithm which uses concept groups as a means of semantic representation, the proposed approach considers the subgroups of each concept number in the lexical ontology. The innovation in the center of this research is the idea that these subgroups provide more precise sense disambiguation which results in improved image indexing. 6. Conclusion This paper proposes a concept-based indexing method using
Semantic DNA (SDNA) to represen t text semantics. The approach tags images by first analyzing the annotation keywords, extracting the candidate SDNA strings from the annotation and selecting the most accurate SDNA for each keyword. The set of SDNA produced for each image, called the semantic chromosome, is then used to index the image. Although the study only focuses on image index-ing, this approach is also applicable to other resources which contain text description including audio, video and multimedia content.
The paper reports good results in using crowdsourcing in evaluating the accuracy of the SDNA disambiguation algorithm.
The experiments show that the algorithm has better accuracy (79.4%) than the accuracy demonstrated by other unsupervised algorithms (73%) in the 2007 Semeval competition. It is also comparable with the accuracy achieved in the same competition by the supervised algorithms (82-83%) which contrary to the approach proposed in this paper have to be trained with large corpora. Further experiment shows a positive correlation value of 0.5779 indicating that the performance of the SDNA disambigua-tion algorithm depends on the quality of the text/annotation.
The approach proposed in this paper is currently applied to the automated generation of mood boards used as an inspirational tool in concept design. Future work includes combining SDNA with content-based image retrieval (CBIR) methods to improve the indexing and retrieval performance.
