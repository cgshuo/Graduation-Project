Overall, Modeling the Internet and the Web is an authority on probabilistic methods and algorithms for modeling the Internet and the Web, covering some of the key topics in these areas, and doing a wide survey of the work in each topic. The first two chapters provide a strong foundation for the fundamentals required to understand the book. The book provides abundant references to good works in the area. The reader might have to refer to the pointed works to get a better understanding, since the book does not always pro-vide a very detailed and concrete explanation of the concepts involved. The authors have done a marvelous job of tying mathematical concepts with Web-based and Internet-related domains, which gives the reader a clear insight into their applications in these domains.

On the whole, Modeling the Internet and the Web is certainly a good read. True to its word, it can serve the interests of researchers, students and practitioners from academia, industry and government alike as it strikes a good balance between theory, examples, exercises and applications.
 Reference Tracing Genres through Organizations: A Sociocultural Approach to Information Design. By Clay Spinuzzi. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2003. xi + 246 pp., ISBN: 0-262-19491-0, $35
Despite the tremendous growth in technical communications courses and programs over the past two decades (Johnson-Eilola &amp; Selber, 2001), the role and status of technical communication has become a much-debated topic in the field  X  s literature (c.f., Kynell-Hunt &amp; Savage, 2003; Mirel &amp; Spilka, 2002). Such introspection has been brought on by the disconcerting suspicion that despite technical communicators  X  best intentions, many people do not use manuals, help utilities, or on-line tutorials to learn their new tech-nologies. Technological problem solving usually entails muddling through, learning from trial and error, or obtaining help from a colleague (or one  X  s children). Clay Spinuzzi  X  s Tracing genres through organizations is a detailed, empirical, and important contribution to addressing these issues. The book challenges many of the bedrock assumptions of recent technical communication theory. At the same time, the book argues that despite two decades of emphasizing the context and process of writing, technical communication research has yet to produce a successful theory to describe accurately how people learn to use their workplace tech-nologies and how these technologies adapt to different situations and conditions.

Tracing genres creates a decidedly post-humanistic orientation for technical communicators. Spinuzzi writes that though technical communicators have created for themselves a  X  X  X audable [humanist] goal X  X  (p. 8) their job should not be to save users from  X  X  X elfish, short sighted employers, an antidemocratic cap-italist system, managers who do not understand or are opposed to the needs of workers, a flawed work structure, poorly designed tools ... , or even a theoretical stance X  X  (pp. 1 X 2). Working from data gathered while examining how public safety administrators used an Accident Location and Analysis System (ALAS) in the Iowa Department of Transportation, Spinuzzi emphasizes that  X  X  X orkers are not victims awaiting a qualified designer to rescue them from poor information design X  X  (p. 222). Instead, he argues that technical communicators must realize that with or (often) without help, workers find ways to use available technol-ogy to complete their tasks. The important question posed by this book for technical communicators is not how to rescue users from bad design, but how to better research and understand how technology gets used in order to develop open, flexible, and adaptable technologies.

Tracing genres is equally a theoretical orientation and a research method. Borrowing the broad category of  X  X  X enre X  X  to describe workers  X  recurring and recognizable activities, Spinuzzi writes that these workers  X  X  X ake official genres that were designed for broad situations and modify them with unofficial genres to pro-duce solutions tailor-made for their own local situations X  X  (p. 222). Spinuzzi calls this consolidation of gen-res a  X  X  X enre ecology X  X  which is a metaphor for inter-coordinated routine and official practices that build on each other over time to create workable solutions to recurring problems (pp. 119 X 120). By examining these genre ecologies, Spinuzzi argues that researchers can identify how users have recreated their technology to suit their own behaviors and needs X  X ssentially, how they have produced their own technical communica-tion for learning and operating their systems.

The book is organized into six chapters. Chapter one establishes the theoretical problem for the book, the  X  X  X orker as victim X  X  orientation Spinuzzi suspects is so problematic for the field. His argument here is compelling. The chapter is based on a thorough survey of user-centered design theory which examines the theoretical orientation, methods, fieldwork, and formalization process of this approach to technical com-munication. Spinuzzi is clear that information designers should be  X  X  X rained, principled, and capable user advocates X  X  (p. 19). But, his quarrel is about how this is accomplished. Spinuzzi argues that the  X  X  X orker as victim X  X  trope  X  X  X evalues the multiple and innovative solutions that workers [like those in his study] de-velop X  X  (p. 19). Spinuzzi claims that when users are involved in design, they typically are brought in to de-scribe their work patterns and to provide feedback on the eventual design, not to suggest actual design parameters, design real systems, or have an overt role in creating the product. Some readers, especially those working in human X  X omputer interaction or ethnographic studies, may find this critique over-stated or perhaps too generalizing. Spinuzzi  X  s orientation adds nicely to a tradition of work that attempts to sup-port users as they make sense of multiple and contradictory information (de Certeau, 1984; Hart-Davidson, 2003; Johnson-Eilola, 1997; Mirel, 1998, 2000). The argument here is primarily focused on methodological practices emerging from rhetoric and cultural studies which Spinuzzi implies too often proceed without suf-ficient empirical data to support an idealized artifact or official solution (p. 22).
 Chapter 2 furthers the narrative established in Chapter 1 by examining field-to-formalization methods.
This chapter argues for a more robust vision for examining design problems, one that integrates three func-tional levels of action: activity, actions, and operations to discern how multiple variables interact to form the context of technology use. Spinuzzi identifies these levels as macroscopic (contextual), mesoscopic (con-ceptual), and microscopic (physical, technical), or the  X  X  X hy, what, and how X  X  of design issues (p. 31). He then turns to the theoretical orientation of activity theory to provide a working model of how these levels interact in work situations as activity, action, and operation.

There is a weakness at this point in that Spinuzzi assumes a degree of familiarity with activity theory many readers will not share. In brief, activity theory is being used in technical communication, rhetoric, and related fields as a way to operationalize the structure-agency dichotomy faced by many social-cultural researchers. Activity theory attempts to theorize the mediation between macro-level social and political structures and the micro-level acts of agency that resist, reinforce, or work around these structures (Russell, 1997, p. 505). In other words, activity theory attempts to account for the ways people use texts to mediate between constraint and creativity, structure and agency in any given situation. Winsor (1999) claimed that activity theory  X  X  X uys us X  X  a greater sense of reciprocity than traditional genre theory since activity theory sees mediation going both ways X  X ocial context and individual actions are  X  X  X utually constitutive and al-ways in flux X  X  (Winsor, 1999, p. 201). Thus, from an activity theory perspective, design becomes  X  X  X eciprocal mediation of behavior X  X  as various agents exchange and negotiate across a system or network (Russell, 1997, p. 509).

The model works well for Spinuzzi, whose ultimate goal is to propose an open-system design that work-ers could adapt to their own preferences and needs. Chapters 3 X 5 provide specific case studies of workers using and adapting various versions of the ALAS. These chapters stress activity-theory as research method and propose a specific process of field work as a necessary requirement for creating the open-system design eventually proposed in Chapter 6. Each case study is formed by examining the  X  X  X enre ecologies X  X  that come together to create the activity system under scrutiny. Spinuzzi consistently works to integrate macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic levels to portray the way  X  X  X eople grapple with information technologies X  X  (p. 63).

Chapter 3 provides an historical overview of the ways the ALAS changed over time, the various reasons for these changes, and the social and technological impacts emerging from these changes. Three interrelated concepts,  X  X  X ontradictions, discoordinations, and breakdowns X  X  are presented in this chapter to explain why technologies change. Employing his ecological metaphor, Spinuzzi explains that  X  X  X ll is not harmonious in a genre ecology X  X  (p. 66). As genre ecologies mediate activity systems, they can be influenced by contradictory motives and destabilizing events which lead to adaptations, work-arounds, and fixes until a new technology emerges. Spinuzzi uses this model to characterize the development of the ALAS through its various incar-nations as a pre-automated, mainframe, DOS, and Windows-based system. Spinuzzi  X  s analysis and insights here are detailed and complex, he provides a thorough examination of the systems and convincing expla-nations for their rise and their decline. Tracing genres is one of the most cogent applications of activity the-ory to technical communication and should be read for that reason. However, I was never convinced that the overt integration of activity theory and its terminology  X  X  X ought X  X  the analysis any richer level of accu-racy or complexity. As an approach, activity theory provides Spinuzzi with a dynamic way to examine the development of the ALAS. However, as a descriptive tool, Spinuzzi  X  s engaging analysis can sometimes be unfortunately weighed down by unnecessary terminology.

Spinuzzi is at his best in Chapters 4 and 5 as he elaborates the genre ecology metaphor and demonstrates the way he uses genre as a  X  X  X uitable unit of analysis X  X  (p. 114). The chapter emphasizes genres are shaped by their history and their use,  X  X  X hen a worker applies genre knowledge, she is taking a solution that worked in the past and applying it to a current problem X  X  (p. 116). By applying and adapting these past practices to current situations, genres bring  X  X  X he values and assumptions of those who shaped them X  X  (p. 116) and thus will shape activity in specific ways. Spinuzzi uses this theory to argue for examining the  X  X  X ntegrated scope X  X  of multiple genres and the activities they spark. Rather than reducing analysis to one genre-one activity, Spinuzzi suggests that a dynamic system of genres  X  X  X as grown up X  X  around any given activity (p. 120).
 Fully understanding that given activity requires elaborating and in some ways parsing a genre ecology. Chapter 4 demonstrates this method by examining the destabilizations workers encountered while using the
PC version of the ALAS. Working through macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic levels, Spinuzzi examines the full genre ecology of the PC version of ALAS. Spinuzzi is not looking for one data point, or the essential crux that lead to the destabilization. Instead, his assumption is that problems occur because a system and its users can no longer handle the multiple coordinations and innovations of its development.

Following the concept of multiple coordinations, Chapter 5 discusses hybrid genres and the process of importing new genres within an activity system. Spinuzzi argues that in such cases, the imported genres cause tensions within the genre ecology and in response to these tensions, workers innovate to fill gaps and ease those tensions. Spinuzzi calls these innovations  X  X  X ridgework X  X  since they connect disparate and conflicting pieces of the ecology (p. 161). The chapter argues that such hybrid genres are often sites of desta-bilization and trouble, typically for those workers whose recognizable genres are forced to merge with newly imported genres.

Mid-way through the chapter, Spinuzzi cleverly reverses this problem to ask whether workers would still be familiar with a genre after it had been exported into a new context. This part of the study examines stu-dents familiar with the Windows version of the ALAS but not familiar with the activity of accident location and analysis. Spinuzzi found that although the students understood how to use the software, they did not have sufficient genre knowledge to complete complex analysis. Spinuzzi concludes the chapter on a cautious note, suggesting that  X  X  X orkers  X  shared interpretations of their tools and their work depend on the relatively stable ways in which they interpret the genres in any given ecology X  X  (p. 197). When these genres are ex-ported to other contexts, or used to create hybrids with external genres, destabilizations occur because workers are unable to effectively reintegrate and use their genre knowledge in the new ecology.
Spinuzzi concludes the book in Chapter 6 by offering an open systems model as an alternative design principle for technical communication. Similar to the open source model of software building, an open sys-tems model of design is a  X  X  X entrally designed artifact X  X  that  X  X  X xists as a nexus for workers  X  innovations X  X  (p. 205). Continuing the metaphor of the genre ecology, Spinuzzi writes that the open systems approach is much like an artificial reef that helps to shape the ecology that grows around it but does not control the ultimate outcome of the activity system. Spinuzzi details three examples of prototype open systems: spread-sheets, knowledge bases, and on line civic forums.

In total, Tracing genres through organizations is much like the ecological metaphor that inspired it. The book has many rewards for those looking to understand, examine, and describe the actual ways people use workplace technology and why and how that technology changes and adapts over situation, time, and context. The book may be challenging and at times difficult for readers not fully versed in contemporary social theory. The omission of authors from the index (or a separate author index) further inhibits novice readers from fully accessing and cross referencing the book  X  s social theory. But, as a study of the  X  X  X nven-tive, wily, sly, cunning, and crafty X  X  (p. 223) the book is a must read for students of technical communi-cation who aspire to careers in information design, usability, or instructional design. The book is also an important research text for graduate students and faculty who work to enhance users  X  experiences with technology.

Finally, the book is an important and timely contribution to the continuing discussion about technical communication  X  s status and role in the workplace and the university. If technical communication is going to sustain its current growth, the field needs books like Tracing genres to provide key directions for exam-ining and theorizing the multiple and contradictory ways people learn to use dynamic and changing work-place technologies.
