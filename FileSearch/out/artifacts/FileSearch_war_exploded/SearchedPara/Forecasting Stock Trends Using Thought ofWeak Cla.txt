 lot of wealth in a short time through it. Multiple people, no matter they have experience or not, take part in it, hoping to become the lucky one, making their own assets increased rapidly. But many people bankrupt [1] because they don X  X  understand the stock market and just follow the trends. We often hear that the stock market is risky, we need to be cautious, especially for retail investors because most people are in a state of losing money. The investor, especially the retail investor, can benefit from the system that can predict the trend of stocks. So predicting trend of stock by explaining seemingly chaotic market data has been an attractive topic for investors and researchers.
 Hypothesis(EMH) [2], the prediction of stock is impossible. If the market is efficient, the historical information will have been fully reflected in the current price. Under this circumstance, whatever method and whatever data is useless. What we can do is to guess.
 it. There exists many methods to do it at present, including the use of artificial methods that is the use of artificial experience quantified to improve the odds to profit, additionally the use of time series [4], smoothness and other characteristics involved the use of the relationship among some stocks to predict the trends. In recent years, with the development of machine learning, more and more people began to use artificial intelligence to predict the stock X  X  trend, and achieved better result than the traditional method.
 [5], Artificial Neural Network(ANN) [6] and so on. The ANN is widely used because of its variety and the strong ability of fitting. And Multilayer Neural network is easy to imply.
 mental data, such as news data [7], people X  X  emotion [8], while some are data of technical analysis, such as price of the past [5]. The reason why we use news data is that we assume the market is inefficient and the price hasn X  X  reflect the past information completely. The reason why we use the data of technical analysis is that we hope to find the shape that may appear many times and the trend may be same as it was used to be because the market is inefficient. Each data has its own advantages and disadvantages. But in the present situation, the result got by news data is much better than by data of technical analysis. But the news data is hard to acquire and to process. In this study, we will try to use the data of technical analysis to get the better result.
 trends of next second, next minute, next hour, next day, next week, next month, under slight fluctuation if we predict the trends of next second, next minute or next hour. Also, the period of prediction of next week, next month especially next year is so long that the fluctuation is too complex to set the point of stop loss. In the end, we choose the trend of one day as our predicted situation. use and the process for the data. In section 3, we introduce our model and the reason why we choose those hyper-parameter. The result is shown in section 4. Conclusion and future work is drawn in section 5. date, the open price, the close price, the high price, the low price and the volume. 2.1 Sample Selection standard test set so it is difficult to compare the results with other results and the judge of result has a lot of problems [9]. In order to solve these problems and explain our results better, we choose a much better result [7] which is from the article whose choose of the test sample and accuracy of prediction is outstanding to compare with ours. The data they want to predict is S&amp;P500. Their test sample is not too little to make us doubt the universality of the experiment. And the accuracy is more than 65%, which is much better than 50%. But the data that they used is news data. For news data, the different access and preprocess will make the result be quite different. It is hard to repeat the experiment. So we choose this result to compare. We will use 02/10/2006 -08/02/2013 as a training sample and 08/02/2013-21/11/2013 as the test sample. Table 1 shows the detail of the data.
 2.2 Input Variables and Preprocessing the lowest price of these data, which have relatively large noise [11]. Direct use of these data to predict will make the result awful. So we preprocess the data, pro-ducing a variety of indicators. This will achieve the purpose of reducing noise to a certain extent. We use a package TA-Lib [12] to generate about 90 indicators, including Momentum Indicators, Volatility Indicators, Pattern Recognition, Cy-cle Indicators and so on. Before using these indicators, we still need to deal with the indicators. Many scholars put the data of those indicator into the model directly and run their model to predict. But almost every indicator need a spe-cific process to make it reflect the trends of next time. For example, a simple moving average does not reflect trends. For a relatively long moving average and a relatively short moving average, when the short line is above long lines, it will indicate the stock will rise next day. Conversely, when the short line under the long line, it indicate there will be a decline on this stock. If we just use a few moving average to predict and do not deal with them first, the model will be hard to learn useful information from the indicators. Especially for the use of RSI(Relative Strength Index) [13], its data can X  X  reflect the trends any more. The use of it is as follows: when the current num of it is more than 70, it means overbought situation, it is likely to be reversed, the price will fell. When the num is less than 30, it means oversold situation, the prices will rise. For all the indicators, we process it simply, so that the value of the indicator will correspond with the trends of the stock. Thus the result will be much better. Table2 shows some indicator that we will use in the experiment. network. At first, we use a much more simple ANN. The scale of the ANN is as shown in figure 1. The first layer is the input data. The second layer has 10 neurons. The third and fourth layer has 5 neurons. We use softmax as the classifier and get the intermediate result after that. We use the intermediate result that we get to compare with the real result. Then we update the parameter of the ANN using BP(Back Propagation) algorithm. In this part, we use three different combination of indicators to get some different intermediate result. After that, we use another ANN to put the result of fourth layer of first ANN together. The scale of the second ANN is shown in figure 2. The first layer is the input which is the output of the first ANN. And we train the model by the different of the real result and the result that we get from the second ANN and update the parameter by BP algorithm. The reason why we choose these two model is that the model is simple enough to get the result. It can converge quickly and the scale of the neurons is not too small to get nothing. The softmax classifier is chosen because it is better than the normal classifier so that We can make the result more accuracy. And the BP algorithm is effective for the model. Close, MA12-4 and MA21-7, MA3-0 and Volume. We use I j i represent the value and { I 1 3 , ..., I 41 3 } as the input to the first model respectively. The reason why we use the different parameter is that we find different days that we use have different result for different combination. And we choose the best days that we can get the best result. We use training samples to train the model, and then apply the model to the test sample. The result is shown in Table 3.
 results are shown in Table 4. We can find that our model and data get the best accuracy through the Table.
 4.1 Profit at close price of every day. And we decide that we buy or sellout according to our prediction for the trend of next day. If we are right for the the trend of next day, we will sell or buytocover at close price of the next day. But if we are wrong, we will sell or buytocover stock at close price or time that we have loss $10.The profit performance is shown in Table 5. The profit of us is much more than benchmark(buy and hold).
 all the input indicators before we use them. The second is that we use the thought of weak classifier. We use the ANN as the weak classifier. The results indicate that our method and model is useful for the prediction of stock. We use the data of technical analysis as the input data. It is more easy to access and preprocess than the news data so every people can do the experiment and get profit from it. In the future, we will continue our experiment to improve the accuracy. We are trying to choose indicators combination by machine instead of people. We can get much more combinations and the probability of getting better result will increase. And we will try to increase the times that we use the weak classifier. The ability of fitting will become stronger.
