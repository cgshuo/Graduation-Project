X  X ormal semantics X  here refers to the study of sentence meaning and its tight connection to sentence structure, described with precision using mathematical methods. Elements in-troduces the central questions, concerns, and techniques of formal semantics, motivated by discussion of successively more comp lex phenomena in English. The end result presented is a particular flavor of categorial or type-logical grammar. use. The book claims to  X  X ot presuppose any prior knowledge in logic or theoretical linguistics X  (p. 7). It would be appropriate for a first course in semantics at the graduate or upper undergraduate level. In addition to linguistics programs, the book would be an excellent text for courses on natural language meaning and related topics in computer science, artificial intelligence, or philosophy X  X nd in fac t, the required level of fluency with mathematical notation and symbolic manipulation may make it more suited to such students, at least at the undergraduate level. This is not a text introducing computational semantics and there is no discussion of practical implementation details. In addition to its primary use as a textbook, this coverage of key topics makes the book a useful primer to the central concerns and results of formal semantics for researchers in a range of closely related disciplines.
 between brief introduction and conclusion chapters. After the introductory chapter, Chapter 2 introduces us to the study of senten ce meaning using judgments of entailment between sentences as the main source of evidence.

 formal semantics, including types, (higher -order) functions and sets, Currying, and  X  -notation. This chapter is particularly well organized and thought through, introducing these technical notions st ep by step, with examples and motivation from linguistic phenomena where possible. This chapter is one of the clearest presentations of these tools that I have seen, with the caveat that it presupposes a certain fluency with the underlying mathema tical notation and concepts. It concludes with an application of these tools to reflex ive pronouns and intersective and non-intersective attributive adjectives, as well as propositional vs. predicate negation and conjunction.
 guage. Generalized quantifier theory is dis cussed, first with descriptions of quanti-fiers as relations between sets, followed by discussion of quantifiers as sets of pred-icates. This is followed by clear and rathe r standard exposition of monotonicity, negative polarity item licensing, the denotation of quantificational determiners, and conservativity.
 of this X  X  want to reiterate again that some hand-holding will be required for stu-dents without backgrounds in, for example, mathematics or computer science. Simple familiarity with the basic concepts and notation of sets and functions is in fact insufficient; the reader must be comfortable moving quickly between these character-izations and translating between them. Take for example the discussion of quantifica-tional determiner meanings, where in the span of just three pages (p. 116ff), the text switches between (a) a Curried, higher-order function (a function from predicates to functions from predicates to truth values), (b) a binary function (a function mapping individuals), choosing each formulation where convenient. Typographic conventions do not help the reader either. Sometimes the variables A and B are functions (as in [4.47a]) and sometimes they are sets (as in [4.47b] right below!). I find these is-sues unfortunate because it would not have taken an inordinate effort to make these (otherwise great) chapters friendlier towards readers who are less mathematically inclined.
 two chapters and will discuss them in turn. The first half introduces the process of function abstraction through hypothetical reasoning in the tradition here called the Lambek-Van Benthem Calculus , motivated by the discussion of non-subject quan-tifiers and relativization. A brief detour introduces the idea of introducing a hy-pothetical premise  X  into a proof of conclusion  X  and then  X  X ischarging X   X  later, resulting in the conclusion  X   X   X  . By analogy, in the computation of many sentences with quantifiers and relativization, we introduce a hypothetical argument (variable) u to yield the u -dependent meaning z , and then later  X  X ischarge X  the hypothesis of u to yield the function  X  u . z , abstracting over the value of u . This presentation is friendly and successful. There is no mentio n of the relation of this process of vari-able introduction and abstraction to synt actic movement as discussed in much con-temporary work on the syntax/semantics in terface, save for one brief mention later (p. 175).
 relationship between semantics and surface word order as motivation to introduce the framework known as Abstract Categorial Grammar (ACG) or also Lambda Grammar .
Under this approach, lexical items (signs) have perceptual denotations that can be (higher-order) functions over strings, not just strings themselves. For example, the transitive verb praise has the perceptual representation  X  x . X  y . y  X  praised  X  x ,where  X  is concatenation; this encodes that the first argument of praise will follow the verb in surface word order and its second argument will precede the verb. This treatment of the syntax of word order will strike readers with any previous training to the intricacies and 838 regularities of natural language syntax as terribly naive. But to be fair, these limitations are readily acknowledged by Winter himself: The chapter ends with discussion and treatment of scope ambiguities.
 of sense versus reference. After a brief and approachable survey of intensional contexts, a domain of possible worlds (or indices) is added to our models and individual concepts are introduced, deriving the desired result that Lewis Carroll is C. L. Dodgson and John believes Lewis Carroll wrote Alice does not entail John believes C. L. Dodgson wrote Alice . This is followed by a more general discussion of intensionalization using the ACG type system introduced in Chapter 5. The chapter concludes with de re/de dicto ambiguities and their analysis as scope ambiguities.
 to a range of additional topics in formal se mantics. This is followed by a brief appendix to Chapter 3 with formal definitions for the basic typing and interpretation system. at both introductory and advanced levels, which include key works in linguistics, computer science, and philosophy of langu age. This is followed by a set of exercises, immediately followed by selected solutions. Some exercises emphasize mechanical practice in engaging with technical notions, some are more conceptual, and some intro-duce new linguistic phenomena to consider. A ll are clear and of appropriate difficulty. Some are downright clever, like problems 5 a nd 6 of Chapter 2 (p. 38ff). The inclusion of selected solutions X  X ust final results, not intermediate steps or detailed justification X  will be appreciated by conscientious students and those using the text for self-study. Chapter 2, where entailment is given a centr al role in the empirical investigation of meaning, there is no discussion of presupposition. In fact, the definition of  X  X ntailment X  (p. 16) as any indefeasible consequence will include both presuppositions and entail-ments proper. Also missing is discussion of motivation and diagnostics for constit-uency. Readers with little or no linguisti cs background would have to simply accept the bracketings and trees given in the text, without reliable tools to work out novel sentences on their own. There is also no discussion of languages other than English. Of course, the methods presented he re are broadly applicable to other lan-guages, but in my experience it is worth making this point. Still, at the end of the day, I generally think the choice of concepts an d topics covered is good, as is their depth. text. The prose feels mature and well edited, with just a small handful of typos. natural language semantics for students with mathematical maturity. I recommend it.
