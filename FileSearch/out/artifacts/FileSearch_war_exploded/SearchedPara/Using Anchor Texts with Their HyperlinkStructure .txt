 As a good complement to page content, anchor texts have been extensively used, and proven to be useful, in commer-cial search engines. However, anchor texts have been as-sumed to be independent, whether they come from the same Web site or not. Intuitively, an anchor text from unrelated Web sites should be considered as stronger evidence than that from the same site. This paper proposes two new meth-ods to take into account the possible relationships between anchor texts. We consider two relationships in this paper: links from the same site and links from related sites. The importance assigned to the anchor texts in these two situ-ations is discounted. Experimental results show that these two new models outperform the baseline model which as-sumes independence between hyperlinks.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval X  Retrieval models Algorithms, Experimentation Anchor Text, Hyperlink Structure, Web Site Relationship
Anchor texts in Web documents provide a short descrip-tion of the target document. Although they are initially cre-ated to help users navigate from one page to another, they usually provide an additional and complementary descrip-tion of the document contents. On the other hand, anchor texts also share similar characteristics with Web queries [6], for example, they are usually short and descriptive. They have a better chance to match user queries than the content words of a document. These two reasons have motivated the extensive utilization of anchor texts in commercial search engines [2]. Experiments have proven their capability of im-proving Web search effectiveness. For example, Craswell et al. [5] found that anchor texts are even more useful than page content for navigational queries.

Although many methods have been proposed to exploit anchor texts, we notice that these methods usually assume anchor texts to be independent. For example, the count of an anchor text from different Web pages is simply accumu-lated and considered directly as a relevance signal of the destination page with respect to a query matching the an-chor text. While the count of an anchor text may reflect, to some extent, the degree of correspondence of the docu-ment to it, a simplistic accumulation may fail to account for different situations where a hyperlink is created. Below are some of such situations. (1) Two links can come from a same Web site or from two Web pages that are copies on different mirror sites. The fact that the anchor text associated is duplicated does not mean that the anchor text is twice more important. (2) Two links can come from two Web sites with coop-erative relationships. These Web sites influence mutually and tend to have similar hyperlinks and anchor texts. The anchor texts from such sites should not be considered as independent evidence. (3) Hyperlinks may be purposely created to boost the ranking of the destination page in Web search. This is often the case for spam links. Such anchor texts should not be assigned a high importance.

The above situations have been documented in many stud-ies. However, no study has been carried out to take them into account when exploiting anchor texts. This paper tries to address the problem of relationships between the source pages of the anchor texts so as to adjust the weight of links. Two types of relationship will be considered: the source pages are from the same Web site; the source pages are from related sites. Two new models are proposed to con-sider these relationships: the site-independent model and the site relationship model. The site-independent model as-sumes that different hyperlinks coming from the same Web site are identical; while the site relationship model further considers the relationships between Web sites (including the relationship between source site and destination site, and the relationship between different sources sites). The weight assigned to an anchor text is adjusted accordingly. Our ex-perimental results show that these two new models can out-perform the baseline model, which uses hyperlinks as if they are independent. In addition, the site relationship model performs the best. This suggests that a finer consideration of relationships between source pages can better account for the true indication of relevance of anchor texts.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss related work. In Section 3, we introduce some basic knowledge about anchor data and introduce the data collection used in this paper. In Section 4, we present a framework in which anchor data is used to provide relevance evidence to search. We then explore two anchor models in Section 5. We report experimental results in Section 6 and conclude our work in Section 7.
The use of anchor data has been widely explored in the areas of Web information retrieval and knowledge discovery.
Eiron and McCurley [6] presented a statistical study of the characteristics of anchor texts. They found that anchor texts resemble real-world user queries in terms of term dis-tribution and length. They also revealed that anchor texts could provide more authoritative information to search than titles or content of the document. Craswell et al. [5] experi-mented the use of anchor texts for site finding. They treated all anchor texts to a destination page as a pseudo anchor document. Each anchor text in the document is weighted by its frequency in the pseudo document. They revealed that anchor texts are more useful than content words for naviga-tional queries. Westerveld et al. [19] used a similar method, but with a language model [14] instead of the BM25 model [16]. Following these studies, we also use anchor texts as forming a pseudo document. However, we will assume some relationships between anchor texts instead of treating them as independent elements.

Fujii et al. [7] explored an anchor model, which further breaks anchor texts into terms . The weight of a term is estimated by considering the weight of each anchor text to the document as well as the weight of the term in the anchor text. In this paper, we focus on whole anchor texts and do not break them into terms.

Anchor texts have also been used in other Web search re-lated areas. Fujii et al. [8] proposed a model to identify synonyms of query terms in anchor texts in order to expand queries. Kraft and Zien [11] mined anchor text to generate refinements or related terms for a query. They showed that anchor texts could produce refinement suggestions of higher quality than content words. Lee et al. [12, 3] proposed to use link distribution of anchor texts over destination pages to distinguish navigational queries from informational queries. Fujii [7] further improved this method by using the distri-bution of query terms to deal with the queries that do not match the whole anchor texts, but part of them. Lu et al. [13] considered anchor texts of links to the same Web page as parallel texts. This allowed them to extract a live trans-lation dictionary for cross-language IR. Amitay and Paris [1] proposed to use the structure of hypertext to produce summaries of Web sites.

In none of the above studies, the structure of the hyper-links have been taken into account when the associated an-chor texts are used to improve Web search. The simplifying independence assumption will raise several problems in the situations that we mentioned in Section 1. For example, the importance of anchor texts of spam links will be boosted, so are those in the duplicated pages. Therefore, we cannot rely on the raw distribution of anchor texts as if they are Table 1: An example anchor in the Web page http://www.sigir2009.org/ calls/papers Table 2: Symbols used in this paper. To reduce space and void confusion, we add some prefix letters in the symbols: A: Anchor, P: Page, and S: Site.
 truly sampled at random. The fact that some Web pages are strongly related does indicate that there could be some correlation between anchor texts from them, and that we should trust less the raw count of anchor texts in such a situation. This problem is the focus of this paper. We will propose methods to deal with possible relationships between source pages of hyperlinks.
To avoid confusion, we first explain some basic definitions about anchor data in this section. Table 1 shows an example of raw anchor. Some definitions including source page, des-tination page, source domain, and destination domain, are described in the table. A source page usually links to one or more different destination pages using different anchor texts, and a destination page can also be linked by several source pages using different anchor texts. Note that in this paper &lt; source page, destination page, anchor text &gt; is as-sumed to be unique, i.e. multiple occurrences of an anchor text linking a source page to a destination page are counted only once. This strategy is used because of the fact that the absolute number of occurrences of an anchor text within a source page is not strong indication of its importance for the destination page. Some authors may include multiple hyperlinks with the same anchor text to the same destina-tion page, while other authors would include only one. A stronger indication is the number of source pages (and their relationships) linking to the destination page, which is the factor which we focus on.

There are some publicly available Web collections built for research purposes. Unfortunately they are usually a small portion of the whole Web and links are often broken. To study the problem in a more realistic setting, we use a larger Web page collection used by a real search engine. It includes about 100 million Web pages from about 4 million Chinese Web sites. There are about 55 million unique anchor texts. All examples and experimental results are generated from this Web snapshot. This bigger Web page collection al-lows us to analyze more realistic problems behind the anchor data, and to test our methods in a more realistic setting.
For convenience, we define some symbols about anchor data that will be used in the remaining sections of this paper in Table 2.
In this section, we will present an anchor based ranking framework. We follow the work done by Craswell et al. [5] and Westerveld et al. [19], and build an  X  X nchor document X  for a destination page. Given a destination page d , the an-chor document contains all the unique anchor texts of d  X  X  incoming links, and each anchor text a i is associated with a weight f ( a i , d ). The anchor text a i is treated as a phrase and f ( a i , d ) is considered as its frequency (or importance) in the anchor document. The anchor document can be represented as follows: f ( a, d ) can be defined in different ways. The way to define it is of crucial importance. In the work of Craswell et al. [5] and Westerveld et al. [19], the f ( a, d ) is simply set as the count of links to d with anchor text a (i.e. the number of pages linking it). For example, if 5,531 pages link to http://china.nba.com/ with the anchor text  X  X BA X , then the achor text  X  X BA X  is assigned a frequency of 5,531 in the anchor document, even if all these links are from a same site. In this paper, we try to define better estimations of f ( a, d ) to improve Web search ranking.

For the purpose of Web search, a good estimation of f ( a, d ) should satisfy the following requirement: For a query q , the document d 1 , which is more relevant than another document d , should also be ranked higher than d 2 according to the anchor document (Problem 1). Only when this condition is satisfied can we expect that the anchor document is useful for Web search. This condition is difficult to verify. A sim-pler requirement that we try to satisfy is as follows: if the query is exactly the anchor text a , the pages which are di-rectly linked by the anchor text should be correctly ranked, i.e, more relevant results should be ranked higher than less relevant results (Problem 2). Other documents and other queries can be handled by a ranking model (for example the Okapi BM25 model or the language model).

Let p ( d | a ) be the probability that document d is author-itative for anchor text a ; p ( a ) be the probability that an-chor text a is used on the Web, and p ( a, d ) be the proba-bility that an anchor-document pair &lt;a , d&gt; is important on the Web. f ( a, d ) should be approximately proportional to p ( a, d ) = p ( a ) p ( d | a ) so that more authoritative documents could be ranked higher when the query is the same as an-chor text a . Following this principle, we define the following general form of weighting function f ( a, d ) for an anchor text a and a destination page d :
In Section 5, we will develop several methods to estimate p ( a, d ). We calculate the anchor text weight f ( a, d ) us-ing p ( a, d ) and a multiplier c (to generate integral values of f ( a, d )), and then generate the anchor documents. We will discuss several ways to define c and p ( a, d ) in the next section. Actually c is set as a constant in most current re-trieval models using anchor texts because it is the same for any anchor and document pair and can be discarded in rank-ing. As an anchor document is constructed for a destination page, different ranking models, for example the probabilistic Okapi model [16] and the language model [14], can be used to index such anchor text and to perform retrieval based on them. In this paper, we used the same Okapi BM25 model as in [5] to process them.
In this section, we present several models to estimate p ( a, d ). We first introduce the link independent model which has been explored in previous work. Two new models, the site independent model and the site relationship model, are then developed in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 .

In the following sections, we use symbol D to stand for the page corpus comprising all Web pages, use A to denote all anchor texts, and use S to denote all Web sites. Implicitly, on D in this paper.
The link independent model is a model used in the previ-ous studies. It assumes that the links (or source pages) to a destination page are independent and they are of equal im-portance to support the destination page. Each existing link &lt;d s , d t , a i &gt; contributes an equal weight p ( a i , d authority of destination page d t . Therefore, the probability p ( a i , d s , d t ) is: p l ( a i , d s , d t ) = 1 then have:
This value is in fact the percentage of links pointing to the destination page d t with anchor text a on the Web. This model is used by Craswell et al. [5] and Westerveld et al.[19]. In this model, the probability p l ( d t | a ) is defined as: p ated as LinkProb in the remaining sections of this paper. In the example shown in Figure 1(a), there are four links with the anchor text a from three different sites. We have p ( d 1 | a ) = 0.75 and p l ( d 2 | a ) = 0.25.
The link independent model makes a strong assumption of independence between links. However, links from the same site usually have a strong relationship (correlation) because they could be generated by the same webmaster. Webmas-ters or document authors may create duplicated links to help
Figure 2: Pages linked by anchor text  X  X okia X  users navigate from different pages to the destination page, or to increase the link popularity of the destination page on purpose. In such cases, the link independent assumption does not hold and the probability of duplicated anchor texts is unduly increased.

To see the impact of using independent links, we plot the probability LinkProb ( p l ( d t | a )) using independent links for different pages for the anchor text  X  X okia X  in Figure 2 (see the red solid curve with circle point, LinkProb). We find the less authoritative page http://mobile.it168.com/nokia. shtml is ranked higher than the authoritative one http: //www.nokia.com.cn (the homepage of Nokia Company). After analyzing the anchor data, we find that many sites contain multiple links with the anchor text  X  X okia X  linking to http://mobile.it168.com/nokia.shtml . For example, there are more than 100 links from the site zhongsou.com to this page, e.g. from the pags http://bbs.zhongsou.com/ sp/s/8331/1214567.html , http://bbs.zhongsou.com/sp/s/ 8331/1214704.html , http://bbs.zhongsou.com/sp/s/8331/ 1214717.html , and http://bbs.zhongsou.com/sp/s/8331/ 1214568.html . These multiple links from the same site ar-tificially increase the importance of the anchor text, while the real importance of it should be much lower.

To solve this problem, we make the following assumptions in our first approach  X  the site independent model: (1) The links with the same anchor text in the same site are strongly dependent and each site is allowed to give one vote on the authority of the destination page; (2) Different sites on the Web are independent and they are equally important to the destination page. Under these assumptions, we have the following definition of p s ( a, s, dt ): p s ( a, s, d t ) = constant = 1 As p s ( a, S, d t ) = P s  X  S p s ( a, s, d t ), and p s none of pages in site s links to page d t , we have: p s ( a, S, d P we then have: p s ( a, D, d t ) = p s ( a, D, d t ) = | APSites( a, d t is abbreviated as SiteProb . In the example shown in Fig-are 3 different source Web sites in total. Each of the links coming from site s 1 contributes a weight of 1/6.
The site independent model actually collapses all links with the same anchor text coming from the same domain. A large value of SiteProb is gained only if many sites link to this page using the anchor text. It is more difficult to spam than the link independent model because generating links in many different sites is much more difficult than generating links in one site. Figure 2 (see the green dashed curve with cross point, SiteProb) shows that for the query  X  X okia X , the site independent model can successfully rank the authorita-tive page http://www.nokia.com.cn to the top.
The site independent model assumes that different Web sites are independent. However, Web sites can be strongly dependent. For example, there are mirror Web sites. The relationships between Web sites should also be taken into consideration. Figure 3 shows the top documents linked with the anchor text X  X BA X . We see that the highly relevant document http://china.nba.com is not ranked at the top when the site independent model is used. By investigating the raw link data, we find that many links to less authori-tative pages come from dependent Web sites. This strongly boosts incorrectly the unauthoritative pages, and penalizes the authoritative ones. The types of dependence between Web sites that we find frequently, which we consider in this paper, are introduced in Section 5.3.1 and Section 5.3.2.
The link between two Web sites may not be as reliable as other links if the source site is dependent on the destination site. In this paper, we assume that the source site s s is dependent on the destination site s t if s s links to many pages in s t . Suppose S2SDstPages( s s , s t ) defined in Table 2 is the set of pages that are in destination site s t and linked by site s . We use c ( s s , s t ) defined in Equation (3) to estimate the weight that s s is dependent on s t : A small value of c ( s s , s t ) may be observed when s s site or cooperative site of s t . In our data analysis, we found that a mirror site usually links back to its main domain with many links. A site may generate many links to pages in its cooperative site to boost their rankings. A large value of c ( s s , s t ) can also be observed when s t is a popular site and s is one of its users. The pages (e.g. news pages, articles, and blog posts) in a popular Web site are often copied and used by many small sites. If the original pages contain intra-site links and these links are preserved in the copies (See Figure 4 for example), the destination pages may receive many duplicated links from the copies on different sites.
In the example shown in Figure 1(b), two pages in site s are linked by site s 1 (note that the third link drawn in dashed line uses another anchor text). Using our calculation, we have: c ( s 1 , s t ) = 1 1+log 2 &lt; 1 while c ( s 2 c ( s
Links between Web sites may also be unreliable when source sites are dependent themselves because: (1) Links are duplicated when they are from mirror sites or copied pages; (2) Some sites are owned and designed by the same group of people to do search engine optimization (SEO) 1 . The links from these sites are less reliable; (3) Links can be added in some Web sites by other persons instead of the webmaster. For example, users can paste a list of links to the pages of forum or blog Web sites. In the Web page collec-tion, we also find that many pages are attacked by hackers, and a large number of links are added in invisible blocks in these pages. For example, a large number of Web sites in-cluding www.gilleda.com , www.gilleda.com , www.365job. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_ optimization com.cn , www.gdtravel.com.cn , www.shisu-lita.com , and www.90yi.com are attacked, and their home pages are mod-ified by inserting the following text, which generate a large number of hidden links 2 :
In this paper, we simply assume that the source sites are dependent if the Web sites they link strongly overlap. For a specific page d , suppose PSrcSites( d ) are the Web sites linking to d . SDstSites( s ) is the set of Web sites pointed by site s . If sites PSrcSites( d ) link to similar Web pages or Web sites, we reduce their weight for estimating the authority of destination pages. This is reasonable because: (1) The hyperlink structure including the out links of mirror sites are the same; (2) The same or a similar list of target Web pages are usually used by a same spammer. A possible reason is that the spammer usually wants to boost a large number of pages but he/she has limited resources (sources Web sites or human editors) to use. A simple way to spam is to insert all the links he/she wants to boost into all pages he/she has created, maintained, or attacked. Using our approach, these phenomena can be countered.

Since it is costly to calculate the relationship between two arbitrary Web sites, the probability that d t is linked by a group of related sites is simplified to: l ( d t ) = Here S s by the source sites of d t . P s equals to the number of &lt; site, site &gt; pairs. s t stands for the site of page d t and it is excluded when l ( d t ) is calculated. in order to reduce the negative impact of popular Web sites. We assume that a group of Web sites are strongly dependent only if the sites linked by them overlap and are unpopular (because popular Web sites may be normally linked by many Web sites together).  X  is a smoothing parameter, and we let  X  =10E-8 in this paper.

Suppose in Figure 1(b) and Figure 1(c), each idf value of the destination sites (drawn in dashed circle) equals to 1. In Figure 1(b), we will have l ( d 1 ) =  X  +0  X  +0 = 1 and l ( d  X  +0 = 1. In Figure 1(c), we will have l ( d 1 ) = and l ( d 2 ) =  X  +0  X  +0 = 1. We see that these values can reflect how unique a destination is linked and how important each link is to the destination page.
The site relationship model considers the above relation-ships among Web sites. It assumes that different sites may have different weights for voting the authority of destina-tion page, i.e., p sx ( a, s, d t ) 6 = constant . Suppose p is the constant contribution of a normal link from site s to page d t . We will add different weights to this normal contri-

You may fail to verify this as the content of these pages may have changed. bution considering different relationships between Web sites by using the following equation: p sx ( a, D, d t ) = X Here s t stands for the site of page d t . p sx ( a, D, d p p sx ( d t | a, D ) is abbreviated as SiteProbEx .
 and p sx ( d 2 | a )  X  0 . 3860. In Figure 1(c), as c ( s c ( s 2 , s t ) = 1, c ( s 3 , s t ) = 1, c ( s 0 , s t  X  ) = 1, l ( d l ( d 2 ) = 1, we have: p sx ( d 1 | a ) = bigger than p sx ( d 2 | a ) despite the fact that it is linked by two more sites.

Figure 3 shows that the pages http://china.nba.com and http://www.nab.com can be successfully ranked to the top if the site relationship model is used. The page http:// sports.163.com/nba is ranked to the top in the site in-dependent model because the Web site 163.com has many mirror sites or friend sites such as http://www.netease.com and http://163.go24k.com and they all contain links with anchor text  X  X BA X  linking to http://sports.163.com/nba . Furthermore, 163.com is a popular Web site in China and it produces many Web pages containing articles such as sport news. Some pages which contain intra-site links with anchor  X  X BA X  are copied by other Web sites. As the site relation-ship model can account for the relationships between Web sites, the resulting vote for page http://china.nba.com and http://www.nab.com are corrected and these pages are suc-cessfully ranked to the top.
In Section 4, we stated that our goal is to generate more accurate weights for each anchor text and to improve the overall ranking base on the BM25 model. In this section, we will examine whether our models can generate better weights for documents directly linked by anchors, and then evaluate the ranking performance using the Okapi BM25 model.
We use 1,131 navigational queries sampled from query logs to evaluate the accuracy of anchor data generated by differ-ent models. The relevance of linked documents for a given query is manually judged. Usually only one or a few perfect documents (for example mirror pages) are judged as rele-vant. For a given query, we sort its linked documents by their weights estimated by the three models, and then eval-uate the ranking accuracy over all queries using the MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) metric [18]. We also use the Suc@k which means that percentage of queries for which at least one relevance result is ranked up to position k (including k ).
Figure 5 shows the experimental results. We find that the site relationship model (SiteProbEx) significantly out-performs the site independent model (SIteProb) with a MRR Figure 5: Results on 1,131 navigational queries Table 3: Performance comparison of models by queries. The value in a cell means the number of queries on which the row model outperforms the col-umn model (relevant document is ranked higher).
 LinkProb / 48(4.24%) 59(5.21%) SiteProb 267(23.60%) 71(6.28%)
SiteProbEx 323(28.56%) 183(16.18%) / gain of 0.07 ( p&lt; 0.001) and a Suc@1 gain of 0.11, and the site independent model outperforms the link independent model with a MRR gain of 0.08 ( p&lt; 0.001). Note that the Suc@10 differences between the three models are smaller than the Suc@1 differences.

We also compare each two models by counting the num-ber of improved queries. Table 3 shows the results. The value in a cell means the number and percentage of queries on which the row model outperforms the column model. We find that 23.6% of the queries are improved by the site in-dependent model over the link independent model. The site relationship model further improves 16.18% of the queries over the site independent model. The site relationship could improve the accuracy of anchor text for 28.56% of naviga-tional queries. This means that our models are useful to improve anchor texts for navigational queries.
In this section, we use the Okapi BM25 model to retrieve the anchor document generated by different models and eval-uate the ranking accuracy. We use the same parameters ( k = 2.0, b = 0.75) as previous work [5].

We use a dataset which contains 3,000 randomly sampled queries and about 140 of returned documents for each query. The documents are manually judged by human editors. A five-grade (from 1 to 5 meaning from bad to perfect) rating is assigned for each document. There are both navigational and information queries in this dataset. We will experiment with the navigational queries (674 out of 3000) and infor-mational queries together and separately.
 The ranking accuracy is measured using a Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain measure (NDCG) [9] based upon human judgments on test documents. We use the same configuration for NDCG as [4]. More specifically, for a given query q , the NDCG@K is computed as: N q = stant (ideal DCG) so that a perfect ordering would obtain NDCG of 1; and each r ( j ) is a human rating of the re-sult returned at position j . NDCG is well suited to Web search evaluation, as it rewards relevant documents in the top ranked results more heavily than those ranked lower. We report NDCG@1, NDCG@5, and NDCG@10 in this paper.
We first experiment with each model and compare their performances. We use the BM25 retrieval model to rank the documents based on the anchor documents generated by each model. To compare with the anchor models, we also experiment with the body text. Experimental results are shown in Figure 6. We can make the following observations: (1) All three anchor models outperform the body model at NDCG@1 ( p =1.53E-12, 4.87E-21, and 1.54E-29 corre-spondingly), while the body model outperforms the anchor models at NDCG@10 ( p =7.26E-07, 3.38E-7, and 6.23E-6). This is reasonable because the quality of anchor text is usu-ally high but its amount is limited, especially for tail docu-ments. Figure 6(b) and Figure 6(c) show that anchor text is more useful for navigational queries than for informational queries. These observations are consistent with those in pre-vious work [5, 6, 10]. (2) The site independent model and the site relationship model outperform the link independent model, especially for navigational queries at NDCG@1 ( p &lt; 0.001 for all). This means that our new models can assign more reliable weights to anchor texts than the link independent model and help find good results at the top for navigational queries. Fur-thermore, the site relationship model performs the best. This means that we could further improve the quality of anchor by considering the relationships among Web sites.
Since the body text and anchor texts may reflect different aspects of a document, they are usually combined together in real-world use. We also test the approach combining body texts and anchor texts in this experiment. Robertson et al. [15] pointed out that a linear combination of BM25 scores is problematic and proposed a linear combination of term fre-quencies (BM25F). In this paper, we use the same term fre-quency combination method as in [15]. Suppose w Body ( i, j ) and w Anchor ( i, j ) are the term frequencies of term i in body and anchor text fields of document j . The BM25 score is calculated based on the aggregated term frequency w ( i, j ) over body and anchor text fields as follows: where  X  is a combination parameter that decides the weight of body and anchor text in the aggregated BM25 score. The combined document length is also calculated using the same method. Figure 7 shows the experimental results when dif-ferent settings of  X  are used. From this figure, we can ob-serve the following facts: (1) Figure 7(b) and Figure 7(e) show that the site rela-tionship model (SiteProbEx) outperforms the site indepen-dent model and the link independent model for navigational queries when the same combination parameters are used ( p &lt; 0.001 for all parameters). The site independent model out-performs the link independent model on the top 1 result of navigational queries when  X   X  0 . 7 . Figure 7(f) shows that the NDCG@10 differences for informational queries between each model are limited. (2) Figure 7(b) shows that adding body text to anchor only slightly improves NDCG@1 for navigational queries. There are only about 0.012 NDCG@1 gain ( p =6.69E-05) for the site relationship model (  X  = 0.1). This suggests that anchor text is already indicative enough for naviga-tional queries if only top 1 result is sought. However, body text is still useful to help improve the overall ranking of top 10 results. (3) Figure 7(f) and Figure 7(c) show that the combination model outperforms both the body model and the anchor model for informational queries, especially on NDCG@10. This means that for informational queries, we can combine body text and anchor text together to yield a better ranking.
Although the use of anchor texts has been widely explored in both industrial and academic communities, anchor texts have been assumed to be independent. In real situations, this assumption does not hold. Links from the same Web site can be dependent, and links from related Web sites can also be dependent. In this paper, we examined several typical situations in which anchor texts can be dependent. Two new models are then proposed to arrive at a better estimation of the importance of anchor texts for a destination page, namely the site independent model and the site relationship model.

The site independent model supposes that different hy-perlinks coming from the same Web site are strongly de-pendent. We consider them to be duplicates in this paper. Therefore, the link from one site is counted only once. This model avoids incorrect boosting of an anchor text when it is used many times on the same source site. The site relation-ship model further considers the relationships between Web sites. Links between related Web sites are considered to be less reliable and are assigned lower weights than links from unrelated Web sites. We analyzed some typical relationships between Web sites, and modeled their influence based on two with different settings of combination parameter  X  . factors: the frequency that the source site links to the des-tination site, and the duplication degree of the sites linked by the source sites. Our experimental results show that us-ing the two new methods proposed to consider anchor texts, we can further improve Web search rankings of the BM25 retrieval model, especially for the navigational queries.
In this paper, we focused on a limited number of depen-dence relations between Web sites, and many other types of relation still need to be investigated. The methods we pro-posed are based on strong assumptions. In our future work, we will further refine the models by making more realistic assumptions, on the one hand, and by incorporating more types of relation, on the other hand. Despite the limitation of our current work, our results already strongly indicate that the consideration of relationships between anchor texts is a promising direction to further improve Web search.
