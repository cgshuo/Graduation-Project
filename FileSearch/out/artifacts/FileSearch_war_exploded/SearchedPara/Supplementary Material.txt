 Below are proofs for the regret bounds from Sections 5 and 6.
 A.1. Proof of Theorem 2 First, we bound E [ k w T +1 k 2 ]:  X  (4 R 2 + 2 X ) T The first line utilizes the update rule from algorithm inequality uses the premise on affirmativeness. Using the update rule again, we get: where the last line uses Eq. (4). Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and concavity of from which the claimed result follows.
 A.2. Proof of Corollary 3 Note that: Therefore: Hence: Given the condition of the corollary, and the above Equation 10, we get that: for some positive constant c , has regret  X   X T Proof We prove this by using Theorem 2. In particu-lar, we show: 1 T for T = 0 (base case). Now assume it holds for T = cumulative affirmativeness R k = w i  X  ( x i , y i ). There are 2 cases to consider:  X  R k &lt; k  X : We have k w k k  X  Thus the induction holds for T = k . Since equation for Theorem 2 is satisfied, thus giving us the bound. asymptotically disappears.
