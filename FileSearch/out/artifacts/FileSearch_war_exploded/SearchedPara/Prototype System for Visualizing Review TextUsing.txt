 Online reputation in blogs, customer reviews of products, and SNS, such as Twitter, has become an important information source for both potential buyers and sellers. However, it is not realisti c to expect someone in a transaction to read all the reputation information because of the rapid growth of its volume. Actually, only the top ranked or latest reputation is used in the buyer decision processes.

This study examines a proposed review visualization system that performs a reputation search and then visualizes the reputation. Many researchers[1,2] have proposed the classification of evaluative expressions into positive or negative ones based on which they calculated the polarity scores of reviews. The difference be-tween our research and other earlier st udies is the method of calculating the scores. Our system extracts evaluative expressions from review text and calcu-lates their polarity scores associated with individual evaluative attributes. Few reports in the literature des cribe direct transformation of evaluative expressions into numerical scores for the respective e valuative attributes, as our system does. Figure 1 portrays a screenshot of our system, which is still under development. Here, category mp3 is selected and ipod is input as the product name. It is also specified that 10 reviews are retrieved from local cached data. The stars beside each review represent the ratings for individual evaluative attributes, which are determined by averaging the weighted polarity scores of evaluative expressions extracted from the review. The radar chart presents the averages of all ratings over analyzed review text for each evaluative attribute. This layout is fairly common among review sites. These ratings indicated by the stars and the radar chart are useful for users to ascertain the reputation quickly. Our research was undertaken to transform review text into appropriate ratings for each evaluative attribute. The proposed system has two parts.  X  creation of evaluative expression dictionaries and  X  visualization of a textual reputation.

Evaluative expressions are expressions r eferring to evaluation of items or prod-ucts. Evaluative expression dictionaries st ore these expressions. In [3], we provide more details to define evaluative expressions further. Using the dictionaries, our system visualizes a textual reputation. In this section, we first explain the evalua-tive expression dictionaries. Then we present a method of scoring and visualizing a reputation. 2.1 Evaluative Expression Dictionary The evaluative expression dictionaries have tree-structured data. The root node represents the category. Other nodes re present evaluative attributes and have evaluative values and polarity scores (Fig. 2). In Fig. 2, the root node is MP3 Player and has child nodes design and portability , which we designate as main attributes. The design node has three evaluative values, good , very good and not good . Their respective polarity scores are 0 . 5, 0 . 8, and  X  0 . 2. The design node also has two child nodes: shape and appearance .
Evaluative expression dictionaries su ch as this are constructed automatically using Japanese reviews in Kakaku.com[5]. We use the Japanese dependency an-alyzer, CaboCha[4], to parse each review. We defined adjectives and adjective verbs as candidates of the evaluative values and nouns as candidates of the evaluative attributes. For dictionary construction, we first add main attribute nodes as children of the root node. These main attributes are determined at Kakaku.com. We then assign the evaluative values that modify the main at-tributes to the modified main attribute nodes and calculate their polarity scores using user-posted ratings with reviews. Evaluative attributes which frequently co-occur with a main attribute in the same review text are added to the dictio-nary tree as child nodes of the main attribute node. The child nodes of the child nodes, i.e., the descendant nodes of the main attribute nodes, are added to the dictionary tree similarly. 2.2 Scoring and Visualizing Reputation When using our system, users first specify a product by name. Users can also specify the number of reviews to be retrieved and the category. Next, the system collects a set of reviews using Web search service API and analyzes each text. We use the Japanese dependency analyzer, CaboCha, to extract pairs of an evaluative attribute and value from the review text. Then, the system calculates the score of each pair by searching the evaluative expression dictionary for the pair.
 Presuming the pair of design and good is extracted from the review text in Fig. 1, then using the dictionary as shown in Fig. 2, it is possible to assign a score of 0.5 to the pair because the identical pair can be found in the dictionary. However, we also propose calculation of the score of a pair of, say, design and nice , using the neighboring nodes such as shape , which has the same evaluative value of nice , because we cannot find the identical pair in the dictionary. When we find more than one nice in the descendant nodes of the main attribute node design , we average each score, which is wei ghted in accordance with the length of the path from the node of design .

Finally, the averaged scores of the pairs e xtracted from a review are normalized into five grades corresponding to the number of stars displayed in the GUI of our system as shown in Fig. 1. The average 0.75 is the polarity score for the attribute of design if we extract a pair of design and very good with the score of 0.8 and a pair of shape and nice with the score of 0.7 in one review text. In our demo, we show the visualized online reputation of some products such as mp3 players and laptops. The attendees can specify a product name, a category, thenumberofreviews,andthesitetoberetrievedwiththeGUI.Moreover, attendees can browse a visualized result along with retrieved review text. The attendees can select the site from Kakaku.com and local cached data. In this article, we proposed a review visualization system that used our tree-structured evaluative expression dict ionaries. Our system can transform tex-tual information of reviews into ratings that are readily comprehensible visually. Moreover, our system helps users to find the reviews of products in which they are interested. Some review sites suc h as Amazon.com do not give scores for individual attributes. They merely assign an overall score for individual reviews. Our system can calculate attribute-wise scores from review text.

In the current version, the selectable categories for reviews are limited to a few particular domains. Exploring other categories is a main concern. Another concern is the quantitative evaluation of the propriety of the calculated scores, which has been improved constantly.
