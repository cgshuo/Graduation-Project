 We propose a method to predict a user X  X  favourite locations in a city, based on his Flickr geotags in other cities. We define a similarity between the geotag distributions of two users based on a Gaussian kernel convolution. The geotags of the most similar users are then combined to rerank the popular locations in the target city personalised for this user.
We show that this method can give personalised travel rec-ommendations for users with a clear preference for a specific type of landmark.

Before visiting a city, many people consult a travel guide or website that lists the most interesting locations. These travel guides are commonly based on the opinions of all other users. However, people have different preferences and there-fore are not equally satisfied by these popularity rankings.
We propose to predict a user X  X  favourite locations in a city based on his travel behaviour in previously visited cities. On social photo sharing websites like www.flickr.com people can annotate their photos, including the geographical lo-cation where the photo was made. Also, increasingly more cameras and smartphones are automatically storing the GPS coordinates when a photo is made. These geotags give an accurate indication of the user X  X  preferred landmarks. Based on a set of collected geotags, we define a measure to identify similar users in previously visited cities. Then we aggregate these users X  opinions in a different city to obtain a person-alized travel recommendation for the target user.

The exploitation of geotags has shown to be effective for various tasks, like global event detection [3] and mapping textual tags to geographical locations [1]. Based on users X  GPS tracks, location recommenders have been proposed that attempt to predict popular places and activities near the current location of the user [5, 4].

In this work we predict relevant locations based on users X  geotags in a geographically remote location. We show statis-tical improvements over all users that visited the 10 largest cities and give an effective recommendation example based on an artificial user profile.
 Figure 2: MAP@50 and NDCG@50 for increasing personalisation weight  X  . weights gives us the top landmarks for each city, based on the general popularity.

To evaluate the ranking we judge a recommended location l as correct if the target user u t has a geotag i within the PC . Figure 1 gives the mean MAP@50 over the 10 cities, which computes the mean over the precision after each cor-rect prediction in the top-50.

Figure 1 shows that the optimal  X  is strongly dependent on the choice of PC . The predictions in this paper will be evaluated at PC = 100 meter, which is roughly the radius of a landmark (e.g. the Colosseum is 189 m. long). Based on the baseline results at PC = 100 we select  X  =68 m. for all further experiments.
 Personalised reranking To personalise the landmark ranking for u t in the target city ( C t ), we compute the sim-ilarity between u t and all other users u c in the similarity city ( C s ), where C t and C s are any two cities from the top-10, both visited by u t . Using the mean shift algorithm we compute the peaks of u t at  X  =68 m in C s . For each peak k of u t we now compute the value of the kernel convolu-tion ( X  u c ( k )) on the geotags of u c in C s . The similarity between the two users is now derived by computing the sum over the minimum value in the two resulting profiles S ( normalised, this will give a similarity score in the range 0-1.
Based on all similar users we now rerank the top-50 pop-ular locations l j , predicted by the baseline method in C t . This is done by recomputing the kernel convolution at these locations while weighing each user X  X  geotags with his simi-larity to the target user:  X  Sim ( l j )= The top-50 locations are now reranked by a linear combi-nation of the baseline and the personalised score: R ( l j )= (1
Figure 2 gives the mean results over all users in the 90 pos-sible combinations of two cities. The baseline is represented by the score at  X  = 0, where all user similarities are set to 1. Compared to the baseline, the optimal result on MAP improves 0.3%. At  X  =0 . 2 there are 10,081 trips where we present an improved ranking to the user, against 8,440 trips where the baseline ranking would have been better. We also show the NDCG (refer to [2] for details) where the gain of each correct prediction is assigned as the inverse popularity of that location (1 /  X  All ( l j )). The increase in NDCG shows that our recommender suggests less popular and therefore more serendipitous locations.

The improvement on MAP@50 is statistically significant in 22 out of 90 city pairs (based on a paired t-test with
