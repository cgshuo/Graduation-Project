 In this paper we study usefulness of users X  gender informa-tion for improving ranking of ambiguous queries in personal-ized and non-contextual settings. This study is performed as a sequence of offline re-ranking experiments and it demon-strates that the proposed gender-aware ranking features pro-vide improvements in ranking quality. It is also shown that the proposed personalized features exhibit performance su-perior to non-contextual ones.
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Algorithms, Measurement web search, personalization, gender-aware ranking
Web search personalization and utilization of a search con-text in ranking received a lot of interest in the research community. For instance, the geographical context was dis-cussed in the paper by Bennett et al. [1], Collins-Thompson et al. [2] proposed a method to provide users with results personalized by their reading proficiency level. Both papers demonstrated that the search context is especially useful in case of ambiguous and underspecified queries. Several stud-ies (e.g., [4, 5, 6]) suggested that enriching the search context with the user X  X  gender data has potential to improve retrieval quality. But, to the best of our knowledge, specific attempts to quantitatively assess possible usefulness of gender data in the large-scale web search setting were not yet made.
However, we consider the goal of this paper to be a lit-tle broader: we want to investigate how information about user X  X  gender can be used to improve ranking quality of  X  X ard X , ambiguous queries not only in personalized, but in non-contextual setting, too. The main contribution of the paper is two-fold: 1) Introduction of two groups of gender-aware features: non-contextual and personalized; 2) Com-prehensive study of both groups of features in off-line re-ranking experiments with respect to queries of different level of ambiguity.
We organize our study as a comparison of non-contextual and personalized gender-aware settings in terms of retrieval quality improvements. The comparison is performed in a set of re-ranking experiments performed in an offline setup, following the evaluation scenario proposed in [1] and [2].
We build a dataset of user sessions and augment it with proposed features. Secondly, we learn a function which pre-dicts a document with a user-specific positive judgement in each query session. Finally, documents are re-ranked accord-ing to their probability of being relevant. The re-ranking quality is measured by the inverse of the rank of the rele-vant document (mean reciprocal rank, MRR). The original ranking produced by the search engine serves as a baseline.
Firstly, we build a set of search sessions (session is a se-quence of actions separated with time intervals not longer than 20 minutes) that took place during a four-week period and were performed by users from a 44mln anonymized set of users whose gender is known with a high degree of confi-dence 1 . The sessions from the first two weeks were used to calculate gender-aware query and document features. The rest of the sessions were used to train and evaluate the re-ranking algorithm. From the latter subset we removed ses-sions associated with 15 most popular queries and all queries which were asked less than 100 times by either female or male users.

To proceed, let us introduce the necessary terminology. A click is called satisfied if it is the last click in the session or it has dwell time not less than 30 seconds [1, 2]. We refer to a query result as examined in a session if it was clicked or there is a click on the result below or a user clicked on the  X  X ext page X  button.

Since labelling relevance judgements to evaluate person-alized search is impractical, we use a user X  X  click behaviour instead. With each session we assign a positive judgement to one of the top 10 urls if it corresponds to the last click A user X  X  gender is determined by a proprietary classifier. This classifier was trained to separate users of both genders using their genders and full names (often gender-specific) specified in their personal accounts at the search engine or in their accounts at popular social networks outlinked from the search engine account. The accuracy of the classifier on the considered set of users is 80%. in the session and this click was satisfied (the last click in a session is not necessarily satisfied due to possible additional queries without clicks). All other documents from the top-10 results are considered as irrelevant, even if they were not ex-amined. Sessions without positive judgements were removed from the dataset. Labelling non-examined documents as ir-relevant provides us with the lower bound on the re-ranking performance. As a result we have the dataset of 15,021,054 sessions with 30,329 unique queries. Due to the filtering per-formed while constructing the dataset, it constitutes 18% of the whole query stream. The dataset was uniformly divided into two approximately equal parts: training and test sets. Learning to rank was performed by the Generalized Boosted Regression Models R package [3], with its parameters tuned on a subset of the training data. The number of iterations was set to 3000, learning rate to 0.005, exponential (ad-aboost) loss function was selected.
Let us consider features used to rank document D for a query Q asked by a user U of gender G . These features can be divided into two groups:
G1: Non-contextual group of gender-aware features in-cludes features which do not take the gender of the cur-rent user U into account: 1) Two features characterize sym-metrised Kullback-Leibler Divergences between gender dis-tributions of users who submit query Q and users a) who click on the documents from the same site 2 as D b) for whom these clicks are satisfied. 2) Entropy of the gender distribution of users who submit Q : H ( G | Q ); 3)Usefulness of the G attribute to predict clicked documents in sessions with query Q , calculated as information gain ratio: IGR ( G, Q ) = 1 where H ( U | Q ) -entropy of distribution of clicks over docu-ments, H ( U | Q, G ) -click entropy calculated using only clicks of users of gender G . Information gain ratio is widely used as a feature selection criterion in decision tree algorithms.
G2: Personalized feature set include the following fea-tures: 1) probability that result D for query Q will be clicked after examination by a user of gender G ; 2) probability that a user of gender G will be satisfied with the document D for query Q after clicking on it;
The original (baseline) ranking algorithm uses features similar to G2 , but calculated on the whole population of the users. The reciprocal of the document X  X  original rank was included as an additional feature in all the experiments.
It should be emphasized that the baseline ranking is a very competitive one since it represents a default ranking of a commercial search engine. We do not report absolute values of quality metrics due to proprietary nature of the system, but report relative improvements over the baseline instead (in accordance with previous studies, e.g. [1, 2]). We use click entropy H ( U | Q ) to sample subsets of queries with different levels of ambiguity: higher values of entropy
Aggregation at the document level did not result into any improvement. The reasons could be: 1) gender-specific in-terest has site-level granularity 2) increased sparsity. Table 1: Re-ranking results for subsets of the test data. Higher values of H ( U | Q ) correspond to higher level of query ambiguity H ( U | Q )  X  3 +0.8 M +1.2 N +1.9 N 5.5% H ( U | Q )  X  2 +0.2 M +0.4 N +0.6 N 33.3% H ( U | Q )  X  1 +0.03 +0.3 N +0.3 N 66.1%
Entire set +0.04 M +0.05 N +0.1 N 100 % are believed to correspond to more ambiguous queries (for instance, in [1]). Symbols N and M denote improvements statistically significant according to Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test at the p &lt; 0 . 01 and p &lt; 0 . 05 levels, respectively. The last column shows which part of the test set is covered with queries of the specific ambiguity level. This ratio was estimated using the first two-week part of the dataset.
As we hoped, described features are especially useful for ranking  X  X ard X , ambiguous and underspecified queries. Also, we see that the relative usefulness of the gender context in-creases as query ambiguity grows. The performance demon-strated on high-entropy queries is comparable to reported in other papers on personalization [1, 2]. It should be noticed that personalized features exhibit superior improvements in comparison with non-personalized ones on every subset of queries.

However, there is a variety of reasons for query ambiguity and, surely, only a part of ambiguous queries can be disam-biguated be means of gender information.

As a natural direction of the future work we consider ex-tending the search context to include more socio-demographic user attributes (e.g., age). Furthermore, it is tempting to learn user latent attributes automatically from their search behaviour and add them to the search context afterwards. [1] P. N. Bennett, F. Radlinski, R. W.
