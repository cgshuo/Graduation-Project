 Texts are not merely accumulations of isolated ut-terances, but the arrangement of utterances conveys meaning ; human text understanding can thus be de-scribed as a process to recover the global structure of texts and the relations linking its different parts (Vallduv  X   X  1992; Gernsbacher et al. 2004). To capture these aspects of meaning in NLP, it is necessary to develop operationalizable theories, and, within a su-pervised approach, large amounts of annotated train-ing data. To facilitate manual annotation, weakly supervised or unsupervised techniques can be ap-plied as preprocessing step for semi manual anno-tation, and this is part of the motivation of the ap-proach described here.

Discourse relations involve different aspects of meaning. This may include factual knowledge about the connected discourse segments (a  X  X ubject-matter X  relation, e.g., if one utterance represents the cause for another, Mann and Thompson 1988, p.257), argumentative purposes (a  X  X resentational X  relation, e.g., one utterance motivates the reader to accept a claim formulated in another utterance, ibid., p.257), or relations between entities mentioned in the connected discourse segments (anaphoric rela-tions, Webber et al. 2003). Discourse relations can be indicated explicitly by optional cues, e.g., ad-verbials (e.g., however ), conjunctions (e.g., but ), or complex phrases (e.g., in contrast to what Peter said a minute ago ). Here, these cues are referred to as relation words .

Assuming that relation words are associated with specific discourse relations (Knott and Dale 1994; Prasad et al. 2008), the distribution of relation words found between two (types of) events can yield in-sights into the range of discourse relations possi-ble at this occasion and their respective likeliness. For this purpose, this paper proposes a background knowledge base (BKB) that hosts pairs of events (here heuristically represented by verbs) along with distributional profiles for relation words. The pri-mary data structure of the BKB is a triple where one event (type) is connected with a particular re-lation word to another event (type). Triples are fur-ther augmented with a frequency score (expressing the likelihood of the triple to be observed), a sig-nificance score (see below), and a correlation score (indicating whether a pair of events has a positive or negative correlation with a particular relation word).
Triples can be easily acquired from automatically parsed corpora. While the relation word is usually part of the utterance that represents the source of the relation, determining the appropriate target (an-tecedent) of the relation may be difficult to achieve. As a heuristic, an adjacency preference is adopted, i.e., the target is identified with the main event of the preceding utterance. 1 The BKB can be constructed from a sufficiently large corpus as follows:  X  identify event types and relation words  X  for every utterance  X  perform a pruning on all candidate triples, cal-
Pruning uses statistical significance tests to evalu-ate whether the relative frequency of a relation word for a pair of events is significantly higher or lower than the relative frequency of the relation word in the entire corpus. Assuming that incorrect candi-date triples (i.e., where the factual target of the rela-tion was non-adjacent) are equally distributed, they should be filtered out by the significance tests.
The goal of this paper is to evaluate the validity of this approach. By generalizing over multiple occurrences of the same events (or, more precisely, event types), one can identify preferences of event pairs for one or several relation words. These preferences capture context-invariant characteristics of pairs of events and are thus to considered to reflect a semantic pre-disposition for a particular discourse relation.
Formally, an event is the semantic representa-tion of the meaning conveyed in the utterance. We assume that the same event can reoccur in differ-ent contexts, we are thus studying relations be-tween types of events. For the experiment described here, events are heuristically identified with the main predicates of a sentence, i.e., non-auxiliar, non-causative, non-modal verbal lexemes that serve as heads of main clauses.

The primary data structure of the approach de-scribed here is a triple consisting of a source event, a relation word and a target (antecedent) event. These triples are harvested from large syntactically anno-tated corpora. For intersentential relations, the tar-get is identified with the event of the immediately preceding main clause. These extraction preferences are heuristic approximations, and thus, an additional pruning step is necessary.

For this purpose, statistical significance tests are adopted (  X  2 for triples of frequent events and re-lation words, t -test for rare events and/or relation words) that compare the relative frequency of a rela-tion word given a pair of events with the relative fre-quency of the relation word in the entire corpus. All results with p  X  . 05 are excluded, i.e., only triples are preserved for which the observed positive or neg-ative correlation between a pair of events and a re-lation word is not due to chance with at least 95% probability. Assuming an even distribution of incor-rect target events, this should rule these out. Ad-ditionally, it also serves as a means of evaluation. Using statistical significance tests as pruning crite-rion entails that all triples eventually confirmed are statistically significant. 2
This setup requires immense amounts of data: We are dealing with several thousand events (theoreti-cally, the total number of verbs of a language). The chance probability for two events to occur in adja-cent position is thus far below 10  X  6 , and it decreases further if the likelihood of a relation word is taken into consideration. All things being equal, we thus need millions of sentences to create the BKB.
Here, two large-scale corpora of English are em-ployed, PukWaC and Wackypedia EN (Baroni et al. 2009). PukWaC is a 2G-token web corpus of British English crawled from the uk domain (Ferraresi et al. 2008), and parsed with MaltParser (Nivre et al. 2006). It is distributed in 5 parts; Only PukWaC-1 to PukWaC-4 were considered here, constitut-ing 82.2% (72.5M sentences) of the entire corpus, PukWaC-5 is left untouched for forthcoming evalu-ation experiments. Wackypedia EN is a 0.8G-token dump of the English Wikipedia, annotated with the same tools. It is distributed in 4 different files; the last portion was left untouched for forthcoming eval-uation experiments. The portion analyzed here com-prises 33.2M sentences, 75.9% of the corpus.
The extraction of events in these corpora uses simple patterns that combine dependency informa-tion and part-of-speech tags to retrieve the main verbs and store their lemmata as event types. The target (antecedent) event was identified with the last main event of the preceding sentence. As relation words, only sentence-initial children of the source event that were annotated as adverbial modifiers, verb modifiers or conjunctions were considered. To evaluate the validity of the approach, three funda-mental questions need to be addressed: significance (are there significant correlations between pairs of events and relation words ?), reproducibility (can these correlations confirmed on independent data sets ?), and interpretability (can these correlations be interpreted in terms of theoretically-defined dis-course relations ?). 3.1 Significance and Reproducibility Significance tests are part of the pruning stage of the algorithm. Therefore, the number of triples eventu-ally retrieved confirms the existence of statistically significant correlations between pairs of events and relation words. The left column of Tab. 1 shows the number of triples obtained from PukWaC sub-corpora of different size.

For reproducibility, compare the triples identified with Wackypedia EN and PukWaC subcorpora of different size: Table 1 shows the number of triples found in both Wackypedia EN and PukWaC, and the agreement between both resources. For two triples involving the same events (event types) and the same relation word, agreement means that the relation word shows either positive or negative correlation in both corpora, disagreement means positive corre-lation in one corpus and negative correlation in the other.

Table 1 confirms that results obtained on one re-source can be reproduced on another. This indi-cates that triples indeed capture context-invariant, and hence, semantic, characteristics of the relation between events. The data also indicates that repro-ducibility increases with the size of corpora from which a BKB is built. 3.2 Interpretability Any theory of discourse relations would predict that relation words with similar function should have similar distributions, whereas one would expect dif-ferent distributions for functionally unrelated rela-tion words. These expectations are tested here for three of the most frequent relation words found in the corpora, i.e., but , then and however . But and however can be grouped together under a general-ized notion of contrast (Knott and Dale 1994; Prasad et al. 2008); then , on the other hand, indicates a tem-poral and/or causal relation.

Table 2 confirms the expectation that event pairs that are correlated with but tend to show the same correlation with however , but not with then . This paper described a novel approach towards the unsupervised acquisition of discourse relations, with encouraging preliminary results: Large collections of parsed text are used to assess distributional pro-files of relation words that indicate discourse re-lations that are possible between specific types of events; on this basis, a background knowledge base (BKB) was created that can be used to predict an ap-propriate discourse marker to connect two utterances with no overt relation word.

This information can be used, for example, to fa-cilitate the semiautomated annotation of discourse relations, by pointing out the  X  X efault X  relation word for a given pair of events. Similarly, Zhou et al. (2010) used a language model to predict discourse markers for implicitly realized discourse relations. As opposed to this shallow, n -gram-based approach, here, the internal structure of utterances is exploited: based on semantic considerations, syntactic patterns have been devised that extract triples of event pairs and relation words. The resulting BKB provides a distributional approximation of the discourse rela-tions that can hold between two specific event types. Both approaches exploit complementary sources of knowledge, and may be combined with each other to achieve a more precise prediction of implicit dis-course connectives.

The validity of the approach was evaluated with respect to three evaluation criteria: The extracted as-sociations between relation words and event pairs could be shown to be statistically significant, and to be reproducible on other corpora; for three highly frequent relation words, theoretical predic-tions about their relative distribution could be con-firmed, indicating their interpretability in terms of presupposed taxonomies of discourse relations.
Another prospective field of application can be seen in NLP applications, where selection prefer-ences for relation words may serve as a cheap re-placement for full-fledged discourse parsing. In the Natural Language Understanding domain, the BKB may help to disambiguate or to identify discourse relations between different events; in the context of Machine Translation, it may represent a factor guid-ing the insertion of relation words, a task that has been found to be problematic for languages that dif-fer in their inventory and usage of discourse mark-ers, e.g., German and English (Stede and Schmitz 2000). The approach is language-independent (ex-cept for the syntactic extraction patterns), and it does not require manually annotated data. It would thus be easy to create background knowledge bases with relation words for other languages or specific do-mains  X  given a sufficient amount of textual data.
Related research includes, for example, the un-supervised recognition of causal and temporal rela-tionships, as required, for example, for the recog-nition of textual entailment. Riaz and Girju (2010) exploit distributional information about pairs of ut-terances. Unlike approach described here, they are not restricted to adjacent utterances, and do not rely on explicit and recurrent relation words. Their ap-proach can thus be applied to comparably small data sets. However, they are restricted to a spe-cific type of relations whereas here the entire band-width of discourse relations that are explicitly real-ized in a language are covered. Prospectively, both approaches could be combined to compensate their respective weaknesses.
 Similar observations can be made with respect to Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) and Kasch and Oates (2010), who also study a single discourse relation (narration), and are thus more limited in scope than the approach described here. However, as their ap-proach extends beyond pairs of events to complex event chains, it seems that both approaches provide complementary types of information and their re-sults could also be combined in a fruitful way to achieve a more detailed assessment of discourse re-lations.

The goal of this paper was to evaluate the meth-dological validity of the approach. It thus represents the basis for further experiments, e.g., with respect to the enrichment the BKB with information pro-vided by Riaz and Girju (2010), Chambers and Ju-rafsky (2009) and Kasch and Oates (2010). Other di-rections of subsequent research may include address more elaborate models of events, and the investiga-tion of the relationship between relation words and taxonomies of discourse relations.
