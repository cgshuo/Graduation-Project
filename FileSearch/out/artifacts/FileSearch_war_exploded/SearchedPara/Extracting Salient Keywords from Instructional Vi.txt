 With recent advances in multimedia technology, the num-ber of videos that are available to both general public and particular individuals or organizations is growing rapidly. This consequently creates a high demand for efficient video searching and categorization as evidenced by the
While videos contain a rich source of audiovisual in-formation, text-based video search is still among the most effective and widely used approaches. However, the qual-ity of such text-based video search engines still lags be-hind the quality of those that search textual information like web pages. This is due to the extreme difficulty of tagging domain-specific keywords to videos. How to effectively extract domain-specific or salient keywords from video transcripts has thus become a critical and challenging issue for both the video indexing and search-ing communities.

Recently, with the advances in speech recognition and natural language processing technologies, systems are being developed to automatically extract keywords from video transcripts which are either transcribed from speech or obtained from closed captions. Most of these systems, however, simply treat all words equally or di-rectly  X  X ransplant X  keyword extraction techniques devel-oped for pure text documents to the video domain without taking specific characteristics of videos into account (M. Smith and T. Kanade, 1997).

In the traditional information retrieval (IR) field, most existing methods for selecting salient keywords rely pri-marily on word frequency or other statistical informa-tion obtained from a collection of documents (Salton and McGill, 1983; Salton and Buckley, 1988). These tech-niques, however, do not work well for videos for two rea-sons: 1) most video transcripts are very short, as com-pared to a typical text collection; and 2) it is impractical to assume that there is a large video collection on a spe-cific topic, due to the video production costs. As a result, many keywords extracted from videos using traditional IR techniques are not really content-specific, and conse-quently, the video search results that are returned based on these keywords are generally unsatisfactory.

In this paper, we propose a system for extracting salient or domain-specific keywords from instructional videos by exploiting joint audio, visual, and text cues. Specif-ically, we first apply a text-based keyword extraction sys-tem to find a set of keywords from video transcripts. Then we apply various audiovisual content analysis techniques to identify cue contexts in which domain-specific key-words are more likely to appear. Finally, we adjust the keyword salience by fusing the audio, visual and text cues together, and  X  X iscover X  a set of salient keywords.
Professionally produced educational or instructional videos are the main focus of this work since they are play-ing increasingly important roles in people X  X  daily lives. For the system evaluation, we used training and education videos that are freely downloadable from various DHS (Department of Homeland Security) web sites. These were selected because 1) DHS has an increasing need for quickly browsing, searching and re-purposing its learning resources across its over twenty diverse agencies; 2) most DHS videos contain closed captions in compliance with federal accessibility requirements such as Section 508. This section describes the text-based keyword extrac-tion system, GlossEx , which we developed in our earlier work (Park et al, 2002). GlossEx applies a hybrid method, which exploits both linguistic and statistical knowledge, to extract domain-specific keywords in a document col-lection. GlossEx has been successfully used in large-scale text analysis applications such as document author-ing and indexing, back-of-book indexing, and contact center data analysis.
 An overall outline of the algorithm is given below. First, the algorithm identifies candidate glossary items by using syntactic grammars as well as a set of entity recog-nizers. To extract more cohesive and domain-specific glossary items, it then conducts pre-nominal modifier filtering and various glossary item normalization tech-niques such as associating abbreviations with their full forms, and misspellings or alternative spellings with their canonical spellings. Finally, the glossary items are ranked based on their confidence values.
 The confidence value of a term T, C ( T ) , is defined as where TD and TC denote the term domain-specificity and term cohesion, respectively.  X  and  X  are two weights which sum up to 1. The domain specificity is further de-fined as where, | T | is the number of words in term T , p d ( w i the probability of word w i in a domain document collec-tion, and p g ( w i ) is the probability of word w i in a general document collection. And the term cohesion is defined as where, f ( T ) is the frequency of term T , and f ( w i ) frequency of a component word w i .

Finally, GlossEx normalizes the term confidence val-ues to the range of [0 , 3 . 5] . Figure 1 shows the normal-ized distributions of keyword confidence values that we obtained from two instructional videos by analyzing their text transcripts with GlossEx . Superimposed on each plot is the probability density function (PDF) of a gamma dis-tribution ( Gamma (  X ,  X  ) ) whose two parameters are di-rectly computed from the confidence values. As we can see, the gamma PDF fits very well with the data distrib-ution. This observation has also been confirmed by other test videos. Figure 1: Normalized distribution of keyword saliencies for two DHS video, superimposed by Gamma PDFs. In this section, we elaborate on our approach for extract-ing salient keywords from instructional videos based on the exploitation of audiovisual and text cues. 3.1 Characteristics of Instructional Videos
Compared to general videos, professionally produced instructional videos are usually better structured, that is, they generally contain well organized topics and sub-topics due to education nature. In fact, there are certain types of production patterns that could be observed from these videos. For instance, at the very beginning section of the video, a host will usually give an overview of the main topics (as well as a list of sub-topics) that are to be discussed throughout the video. Then each individual topic or sub-topic is sequentially presented following a pre-designed order. When one topic is completed, some informational credit pages will be (optionally) displayed, followed by either some informational title pages show-ing the next topic, or a host introduction. A relatively long interval of music or silence that accompanies this transitional period could usually be observed in this case.
To effectively deliver the topics or materials to an au-dience, the video producers usually apply the following types of content presentation forms: host narration, inter-views and site reports, presentation slides and informa-tion bulletins, as well as assisted content that are related with the topic under discussion. For convenience, we call the last two types as informative text and linkage scene in this work. Figure 2 shows the individual examples of video frames that contain narrator, informative text, and the linkage scene. Figure 2: Three visual content types: (a) narrator, (b) in-formative text, and (c) linkage scene. 3.2 AudioVisual Content Analysis This section describes our approach on mining the afore-mentioned content structure and patterns for instructional videos based on the analysis of both audio and visual in-formation. Specifically, given an instructional video, we first apply an audio classification module to partition its audio track into homogeneous audio segments. Each seg-ment is then tagged with one of the following five sound labels: speech, silence, music, environmental sound, and speech with music (Li and Dorai, 2004). The support vector machine technique is applied for this purpose.
Meanwhile, a homogeneous video segmentation process is performed which partitions the video into a series of video segments in which each segment con-tains content in the same physical setting. Two groups of visual features are then extracted from each segment so as to further derive its content type. Specifically, fea-tures regarding the presence of human faces are first ex-tracted using a face detector, and these are subsequently applied to determine if the segment contains a narrator. The other feature group contains features regarding de-tected text blobs and sentences from the video X  X  text over-lays. This information is mainly applied to determine if the segment contains informative text. Finally, we label segments that do not contain narrators or informative text as linkage scenes. These could be an outdoor landscape, a field demonstration or indoor classroom overview. More details on this part are presented in (Li and Dorai, 2005).
The audio and visual analysis results are then inte-grated together to essentially assign a semantic audiovi-sual label to each video segment. Specifically, given a segment, we first identify its major audio type by finding the one that lasts the longest. Then, the audio and visual labels are integrated in a straightforward way to reveal its semantics. For instance, if the segment contains a narra-tor while its major audio type is music, it will be tagged as narrator with music playing . A total of fifteen possi-ble constructs is thus generated, coming from the com-bination of three visual labels (narrator, informative text and linkage scene) and five sound labels (speech, silence, music, environmental sound, and speech with music). 3.3 AudioVisual and Text Cues for Salient Keyword Having acquired video content structure and segment content types, we now extract important audiovisual cues that imply the existence of salient keywords. Specifically, we observe that topic-specific keywords are more likely appearing in the following scenarios (a.k.a cue context ): 1) the first N 1 sentences of segments that contain narra-tor presentation ( i.e. narrator with speech), or informa-tive text with voice-over; 2) the first N 2 sentences of a new speaker ( i.e. after a speaker change); 3) the question sentence; 4) the first N 2 sentences right after the ques-tion (i.e. the corresponding answer); and 5) the first N sentences following the segments that contain silence, or informative text with music. Specifically, the first 4 cues conform with our intuition that important content sub-jects are more likely to be mentioned at the beginning part of narration, presentation, answers, as well as in ques-tions; while the last cue corresponds to the transitional period between topics. Here, N 1 is a threshold which will be automatically adjusted for each segment during the process. Specifically, we set N 1 to min ( SS , 3) where SS is the number of sentences that are overlapped with each segment. In contrast, N 2 is fixed to 2 for this work as it is only associated with sentences.

Note that currently we identify the speaker changes and question sentences by locating the signature charac-ters (such as  X  &gt;&gt;  X  and  X ? X ) in the transcript. However, when this information is unavailable, numerous exist-ing techniques on speaker change detection and prosody analysis could be applied to accomplish the task (Chen et al., 1998). 3.4 Keyword Salience Adjustment Now, given each keyword ( K ) obtained from GlossEx , we recalculate its salience by considering the following three factors: 1) its original confidence value assigned by GlossEx ( C GlossEx ( K ) ); 2) the frequency of the keyword occurring in the aforementioned cue context ( F cue ( K ) and 3) the number of component words in the keyword ( | K | ). Specifically, we give more weight or incentive (
I ( K ) ) to keywords that are originally of high confi-dence, appear more frequently in cue contexts, and have multiple component words. Note that if keyword K does not appear in any cue contexts, its incentive value will be zero.
 Figure 3 shows the detailed incentive calculation steps. Here, mode and  X  denote the mode and standard devia-tion derived from the GlossEx  X  X  confidence value distri-bution. MAX CONFIDENCE is the maximum con-fidence value used for normalization by GlossEx , which is set to 3.5 in this work. As we can see, the three afore-mentioned factors have been re-transformed into C ( K ) , F ( K ) and L ( K ) , respectively. Please also note that we have re-adjusted the frequency of keyword K in the cue context if it is larger than 10. This intends to reduce the biased influence of a high frequency. Finally, we add a small value  X  to | K | and F cue respectively in order to avoid zero values for F ( K ) and L ( K ) . Now, we have similar value scales for F ( K ) and L ( K ) ( [1 . 09 , 2 .xx ] and C ( K ) ( [0 , 2 .yy ] ), which is desirable.
As the last step, we boost keyword K  X  X  original salience C GlossEx ( K ) by I ( K ) . Figure 3: Steps for computing incentive value for key-word K appearing in cue context Four DHS videos were used in the experiment, which contain diverse topics ranging from bio-terrorism history, weapons of mass destruction, to school preparation for terrorism. The video length also varies a lot from 30 minutes to 2 hours. Each video also contains a variety of sub-topics. Video transcripts were acquired by extracting the closed captions with our own application.

To evaluate system performance, we compare the key-words generated from our system against the human-generated gold standard. Note that for this experiment, we only consider nouns and noun phrases as keywords. To collect the ground truth, we invited a few human eval-uators, showed them the four test videos, and presented them with all candidate keywords extracted by GlossEx . We then asked them to label all keywords that they con-sidered to be domain-specific, which is guidelined by the following question:  X  would you be satisfied if you get this video when you use this keyword as a search term ? X .
Table 1 shows the number of candidate keywords and manually labeled salient keywords for all four test videos. As we can see, approximately 50% of candidate key-words were judged to be domain-specific by humans. Based on this observation, we selected the top 50% of highly ranked keywords based on the adjusted salience, and examined their presence in the pool of salient key-words for each video. As a result, an average of 82% of salient keywords were identified within these top 50% of re-ranked keywords. In addition, the audiovisual cues improve precision and recall by 1.1% and 1.5% respec-tively. Table 1: The number of candidate and manually labeled salient keywords in the four test videos We described a mutimodal feature-based system for ex-tracting salient keywords from instructional videos. The system utilizes a richer set of information cues which not only include linguistic and statistical knowledge but also sound classes and characteristic visual content types that are available to videos. Experiments conducted on the DHS videos have shown that incorporating multimodal features for extracting salient keywords from videos is useful.

Currently, we are performing more sophisticated ex-periments on different ways to exploit additional audio-visual cues. There is also room for improving the calcu-lation of the incentive values of keywords. Our next plan is to conduct an extensive comparison between GlossEx and the proposed scheme.
