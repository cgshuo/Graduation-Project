 H.3.4 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Systems and Software Design why -questions, paragraph retrieval, discourse annotation
In the current research project, we aim at developing a system for answering why -questions ( why -QA). In previous research, we investigated the possibilities of answer extrac-tion for why -QA exploiting discourse structure in the source text. One conclusion was that many why -questions require a complete paragraph as an answer. In the present paper, we will first discuss the results and the main conclusions that we obtained from these experiments. Then, we will present our research plans concerning paragraph retrieval for why -QA.
In [3], we present and discuss an approach to answer ex-traction for why -questions. As a model for discourse anno-tation, we use Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), in the variant developed by Carlson et al. [1]. Our answer extrac-tion method is based on the idea that the topic of a why -question and its answer are siblings in the RST structure of the document, connected by a relation that is relevant for why -questions.

We evaluated our discourse-based method for answer ex-traction on two sets of why -questions. The first data collec-tion consists of 372 why -questions obtained from elicitation of native speakers to seven annotated texts from the RST Treebank [1]. The second data collection contains 400 ques-tions that have been submitted to the online QA system answers.com with a set of answer fragments that we man-ually extracted from Wikipedia and annotated with RST structures.

A manual analysis of the questions and the correspond-ing RST structures shows that the maximum recall that can be achieved using our discourse-based answer extraction ap-proach is around 60%. We find that some ( X  X xplanation-type X ) RST-relations have a large predictive power in an-swer selection but we conclude that our answer extraction approach should be combined with other methods in order to increase recall.

We consider paragraph retrieval as an alternative and sup-plementary approach. We studied all questions in our second data collection and we found that for 84.7% of questions, a complete paragraph from Wikipedia is a satisfactory answer.
We aim at developing a method for paragraph retrieval in which we incorporate knowledge about the presence of relevant RST relations. We formulate the following research question:  X  X ow can we realize intelligent paragraph retrieval and paragraph ranking for why -QA, incorporating knowl-edge on discourse relations? X 
We suggest the following approach for answering why -questions: (1) question analysis and query creation; (2) doc-ument retrieval; (3) paragraph retrieval and ranking.
One problem that we face in developing a paragraph re-trieval method is that general language models are not well geared for retrieving short text units such as paragraphs. This means that we need to develop a language model that is suitable for possibly very short text fragments. More-over, we aim to incorporate quantifiable information on the presence of RST relations in the language model. For au-tomatically detecting RST relations, we plan to extend the approach as implemented in Soricut and Marcu X  X  Spade tool [2] so that it is specifically geared for detecting answers to why -questions.
