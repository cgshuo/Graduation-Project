 In modern times, technical progress accelerates the development of new disciplines and sub-disciplines. That is why new and specific termi-nology becomes more necessary. The conse-quences of this interdisciplinarity are multilingual communication problems between non-professionals and experts of a special field or between experts of navigation domains of dif-ferent transportation modes. Especially, these semantic problems include synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy-hyponymy relations and ambiguity etc. The main target of the iglos 1 ter-minology management system as terminological tool of the 21st century is to avoid the multilin-gual misunderstanding between special lan-guages of different domains by comparing the definitions of technical terms in heterogeneous languages. Keywords  X  terminology management, terminology, multilingual, semantical problems, localisation, positioning, position, location for different technical languages or varieties at international level. Multilingual communication problems such as synonymy, antonymy, transla-tion problems, ambiguity, risk of confusion etc. between experts of special fields intensify by the transforming technology. People extend and spe-cialise their acquirements and tasks in the fields of technology. In general, the correct translation of a technical term is only possible if one knows the terminology of the special field. and  X  X osition X  and  X  X ositioning X  are in the focus of our terminological contemplation. At this point, we want to analyse which relation exists between these terms in English, German and French. Finally, we want to display the equiva-lences in three languages. a cooperation of the Institute for Traffic Safety and Automation Engineering and the Department of German Linguistics of the Braunschweig Uni-versity of Technology.

With this terminology management system, it is intended to accelerate and facilitate a consistent, multilin -gual and unambiguous development of technical terminology for optimising the scientific and commercial communication. The foundation of the iglos system consists in a development of the variety-based trilateral sign model. two lexemes and on the other hand of one rela-tional lexeme which is placed between these both (Schnieder, 2012). or the unit of a word paradigm. In general, a lexeme is concretised by its grammatical word forms. In our case, terms are special lexemes. denomination such as  X  X avigation X ), a definition which relates to the context and a variety as a technical language (e.g. linguistics, technics, etc.). There is at least one relation between two lexemes. This is specified by at least one relational lexeme or a relation type. confusion ( isMixesUpWith ), translation ( hasTranslation ), output ( hasOutput, isOutputOf ), input ( hasInput, isInputOf ), holonymy ( hasPart, isPartOf ), meronymy ( isPartOf, hasPart) , antonymy ( hasAntonym ), synonymy ( isSynonymOf ), polysemy ( isPolysemOf ), homonymy ( hasHomonym ) Basically, the iglos sign model enables the speci-fication of terminologies by avoiding termino-logical haziness and creating and visualising concrete relations between terms in a systematic context (variety). These relations are unobstructedly typable. and ambiguity (disambiguation) of terms. On the basis of the variety-based iglos sign model, there is a communication between different languages (multilingualism) on the one hand and between different domains (multidisciplinarity) on the other hand. In our consideration, we want to pre-sent the multilingual problems in relation to ter-minology in the domain of traffic engineering and which solution approaches can be proposed for them on the basis of iglos . eral methodological approaches for avoiding the linguistic problems e.g. between the terms  X  X osi-tion X ,  X  X ositioning X ,  X  X ocation X  and  X  X ocalisa-tion X  in English, German and French: German and French in general linguistic usage , in etymologic, grammatical, normative tech-nical and relational perspective. kinds of these semantical problems between the different terms in the navigation domain. 2.1 Kinds of Problems in Navigation Ter-raised the four terminological questions: 2.2 Results of the Approaches terms can be avoided or minimised by relating them with each other. According to normative sources (e.g. DIN standards), we tried to create relations between these terms. There are various relation types such as  X  X ynonymy X ,  X  X ntonymy X ,  X  X art-whole relation X ,  X  X ypernymy-hyponymy relation X ,  X  X mbiguity X ,  X  X ranslation X   X  X equence X ,  X  X unction X ,  X  X isk of confusion X ,  X  X onverseness X  etc. es, we have found out: 80 the result that  X  X ositioning X  and  X  X ocalisation X  or rather  X  X osition X  and  X  X ocation X  are not syno-nyms. Firstly, they are sequent and secondly there is a risk of confusion between both. Whereas,  X  X ositioning X  describes the process for achieving the place in a three-dimensional refer-ence system,  X  X ocalisation X  is a large place in a two-dimensional reference system and enables local orientation on the surface of the earth (see Yurdakul; Schnieder; Hodon 2013). type that describes a point or geometry potential-ly occupied by an object or person X  (ISO 19132, 2007) and  X  X ocation X  is the  X  X dentifiable geo-graphic place X  (ISO 19134, 2007) which must be localised by functional resources. are state nominations. In contrast to them,  X  X osi-tioning X  and  X  X ocalisation X  are specific functions. A function is a specific process that a system is able to perform whereas a state is the entirety of all physical quantities of a physical system. In general, we can notice that there is a causal and functional coherence between these functions and states:  X  X ocalisation X  leads to  X  X ocation X  and  X  X ositioning X  to  X  X osition X  or  X  X ocation X  isOutputOf  X  X ocalisation X  and  X  X osition X  of  X  X o-sitioning X . In addition,  X  X osition X  isInputOf  X  X o-calisation X  and  X  X ocation X  of  X  X ositioning X . Finally, all terms together (as hyponyms) are related to  X  X avigation X  (figure 2). 2.3 Translation of Terms into German and to German and French. On the basis of this schedule, it becomes obvious that the terms  X  X o-sition X  and  X  X ositioning X  have similar denomina-tions in French and German whereas  X  X ocation X  and  X  X ocalisation X  are differently denominated. The term  X  X ocalisation X  has the same denomina-tion in French, but not in German. In relation to  X  X ocation X , there are different denominations in each of the three languages. tioning X  are internationalisms which is a bor-rowed term and which occurs in several languages.  X  X ocation X  and  X  X ocalisation X  are typ-ically English terms but not especially German. Instead of  X  X rtung X , there will be the possibility to use  X  X okalisierung X  as internationalism in German. English German French ous and consistent relation types, a terminology building can be constructed. There are various relations between different terms in this building. scribed as an ontology structure with single lex-emes are bound together by relations. Furthermore, iglos is a terminology management system of the next generation which collects and integrates different (technical) languages and guides terminologists to construct terminology. munication problems not only between experts of traffic engineering. Linguistic, normative and scientific definitions and the iglos sign model offer several advanced methodological solutions and approaches for identifying and avoiding the-se problems. between the terms  X  X osition X ,  X  X ocation X ,  X  X ocali-sation X  and  X  X ositioning X . These differentiate in causal and functional relation. In addition, translations from English into Ger-man and French are not very unproblematic be-cause e.g.  X  X osition X  is translated in German both as  X  X age X  and as  X  X tandort X . At this point, we have a risk of confusion with  X  X ocation X  be-cause of the translation problem in German or in other languages. Finally, we could find out that the four analysed terms exist in all three lan-guages and that the relation between them is the same. determination of relations between these four terms in each three languages.
