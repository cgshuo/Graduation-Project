A user of an IR system is often left in the dark with a query box. It may be useful in many cases to present some kind of representation of the underlying collection to the user. Obviously, constructing and providing a representa-tion of a massive collection such as the Web is very difficult and probably not very useful. However, such functionality could be feasible and useful for a small or specialized collec-tion. The other issue that keeps the user in the dark is the presentation of the retrieved information. A typical search engine presents the retrieved results ordered by their rele-vance . While working with specialized collections in which most of the documents are about a specific domain or topic, relevance is not enough to derive and order the retrieved set. A user may also want to know how much the retrieved docu-ments differ from each other. In other words, in addition to relevance, it becomes useful to present novelty among those documents.

We demonstrate this concept using DiscoverInfo -a sys-tem that allows the user to explore a collection of documents by their relevance and novelty. The system facilitates dis-covery through three functions. 1. Search: The system provides a simple searching in-2. Browse: DiscoverInfo system prepares a term cloud
