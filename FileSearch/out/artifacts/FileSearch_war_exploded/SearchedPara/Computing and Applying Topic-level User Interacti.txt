 With the development of microblog services, tens of thousands of messages are produced every day and recommending useful messages according to users X  interest is recognized as an effective way to overcome the informatio n overload problem. Collaborative filtering which rooted from recommender system has been utilized for microblog recommendation, where social relationship information can help improve the recommendation performance. However, most of existing met hods only consider the static relationship, i.e. the following relationship, which totally ignore the relationship conveyed by users X  repost behaviors. To explore the effects of behavior based re lationship on recommendation, we propose an Interaction Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF) approach. Specifically, we first use topic model to analyze users X  interactive behaviors and measure the topic-specific relationship strength, then we incorporate the relationship factor into the matrix factorization framework. E xperimental results show that compared to the current popular social recommendation methods, IBCF can achieve better performance on the MAP and NDCG evaluation measures, and have better interpretability for the recommended results. H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Information filtering Interaction Relationship; Soci al Recommendation; Microblog Recommendation 
With the development of so cial networks, microblog has become one of the most popular Internet applications in recent years, on which tens of thousands of messages are produced every Recommendation techniques are recogn ized as effective way to overcome this problem, especi ally social recommendation methods which incorporate social relationship have been well investigated. 
However, most existing works [1,2,3,4] usually utilize the existence or strength of relationshi p, which could just verify how users connect to their friends, but cannot explain why they build that relationship. To address the problem, we present a new factors, by analyzing the textual content associated with each interaction between users and their friends, and apply this approach in microblog recommendation to improve the performance. 
The main contributions of th is paper are as follows: (1) Analyze the topic related factor s of relationship from users' measurement. (2) Introduce time factor into inte raction, and propose a time relationship more effectively. (3) Aggregate the topic related fa ctors of relationship into matrix factorization base d recommendation model. Many social recomme ndation methods have been investigated. Konstas et al. [1] proposed a random walk model RWR to integrate friendship and social ta gs. Ma et al. [2] proposed two social regularization methods which constrain the matrix factorization objective function with user social regularization terms. Based on the above work, Mohsen et al. [3] further proposed SocialMF model  X  which introduce the propagation of the feature vector of his direct neighbors. 
These methods require using explic it relationship, which is not always available. Therefore, many researcher have proposed methods to measure possible re lationship by using rating information. Pitsilis et al. [5, 6] proposed trust measurement based on the difference of user ratings. Donovan et al. [7] utilized the ratio of correct rating to compute users X  trust. Lathia et al. [8] extended this method by in troducing penalty parameter. 
Although the aforementioned me thods have moved a step forward in the research of social recommendation, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work about investigating topic-level relationship in social recommendatio n. We believe that, for a user posted by u2 , but just some certain topics. This could be observed from actions of repost in microblog: Users always repost certain topic-related microblogs from certain friends. 
As shown in Figure 1, we exte nd common user relationship (a) to topic-level user relationship (b), users would have different relationship strength in different topics with a single friend.
We utilize the textual content of interactions to represent users X  relationship, and apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to label relationship in multiple topics. 
As shown in Figure 2, for relationship r 1,2 , topic distribution ~Dirichlet(  X  ) , topic-specific relationship-word distribution ~Dirichlet(  X  ) , so as to decompose the latent factors of relationship into a combination of latent factors of words: 
Here, W is the term set of the textual content of relationship r  X   X  R k is a k-dimension vector to represent the topic vector of r
In addition, because microblog messages are short texts, it is often ineffective to directly use LDA model to calculate the distribution of topics. Therefore, in our experiments, we apply USER Scheme methods proposed by Hong et al. [9] to process these interactions X  content.
Suppose microblog d is one of the interaction between user i and j , and the distribution on topic t k is p(t the strength of relationship r i,j on topic t k interaction microblogs, as shown in Eq. (2): 
Here, D i,j is the set of all microblogs which user i have reposted from friend j . 
By this definition, the strength of relationship r topics would be different. This can be explained as: Users establish a relationship with a friend, just because of some specific interests, instead of all topics.
Each interaction has its time property, which reflects the time-sensitive feature of relationshi p. We suppose that users tend to trust friends who has interacted with him recently, then we introduce a parameter  X  , to define the strength of relationship that decays with time: 
As shown in Eq. (3), as time passed, each interaction will make less impact on the strength of relationship, so as to strengthen the relationship with those friends who have interacted with user in more recent time. 
To integrate the topic factor an d strength factor, we propose a K  X 
K diagonal matrix, where each di agonal element represents the strength of relationship on each topic. As shown in Eq. (4): 
Then we could generate the weig hed topic vector of relationship by calculating  X   X , X   X   X , X  , and  X   X , X   X   X , X   X  R k . 
After that, we propose our recommendation model IBCF ( Interaction-Based Collaborative Filtering ), based on the Regularized SVD [10] method, here we utilize th e weighed topic vector of relationship as latent factors of user: which is crawled from Sina Weibo, the most popular social network website in China. We se lect some active users as our experimental subjects, and the selection criteria are shown in Table 1: 
Following the criteria, we choose 538 users and 26271 followers dataset as our experi mental dataset. Following the experimental strategies used in [4, 12], we take the ratings r positive sample, we choose 4 not -repost messages as negative samples. 
Then we split the dataset into training dataset, validation dataset and test dataset based on timeline. For these selected 538 users, we time point. By doing this, we can take the sub-dataset before the split time point as training dataset, and the sub-dataset after the validation dataset from training dataset. 
Baseline Methods: We compare our approach to several typical methods, such as content-ba sed LDA, item-based KNN, state-of-the-art matrix factor ization model RSVD, and social recommendation model SocialMF. We user NDCG@n, P@n and MAP to evaluate our approach. 
The experiment results are shown in Figure 3, on the left are the performance on P@n and MAP, on the right are NDCG. 
From the results, we can see that, the effect of Item-based KNN is poor, the main reason may be the sparseness of microblogs X  rating. For most microblogs, they could only get few reposts, accurately. Content-based recommendation method LDA make a trifle improvement, which may be due to the contribution of topic. RSVD could reach 0.3259 on MAP, wh ile SocialMF could make a better performance owing to the fu sion of social relationship, its MAP goes to 0.3973. By comparison, our approach IBCF could achieve 0.4758, which gets 45.99% improvement compared with RSVD, and 19.75% to SocialMF. And on NDCG, we could observe the similar improvement given by IBCF. 
In this paper, we have conduct ed a study on users X  relationship from topic-level interactions, pro posed a new approach to measure its strength, and applied this topic-level interaction into microblog recommendation. Experimental resu lts show that our approach IBCF could make a better perfo rmance comparing to typical recommendation methods. This also validates the importance of user interaction in social networks for interactive behavior could reflect the common interests be tween users and friends more accurately. 
Our future work include considering the cold start problem, for user would not be able to inter act with each of his friends. To relationship and interactions toge ther to extend our approach.
