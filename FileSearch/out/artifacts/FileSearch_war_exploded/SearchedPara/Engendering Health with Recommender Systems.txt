 The first Workshop on Engendering Health with Recom-mender Systems was organized in conjunction with ACM RecSys 2016. The focus of the workshop was on bringing together researchers and practitioners from diverse areas of health, well-being, decision support, and behavioral change. Health-related issues in recommender systems have been a growing research topic in the recent years and this was a ini-tial attempt at bringing together academics and practition-ers to share their experiences on working on related issues.

Busy lifestyles, abundant options, lack of knowledge; there are many reasons why people make poor decisions relating to their health [1, 2]. Yet these poor decisions are lead-ing to epidemics, which represent some of the greatest chal-lenges we face as a society today. Noncommunicable Dis-eases (NCDs), which include cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes, account for  X  60% of total deaths worldwide. These diseases share the same four behavioral risk factors: tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful consumption of alcohol and can be prevented and sometimes even reversed with simple lifestyle changes. Eating more healthily, exercising more ap-propriately, sleeping and relaxing more, as well as simply being more aware of one X  X  state of health are all things that would lead to improved health. Yet knowing exactly what to change and how, implementing changes and maintaining changes over long time periods are all things people find challenging. These are also problems, for which we believe recommender systems can provide assistance by offering spe-cific, tailored suggestions for behavioral change. In recent years recommender systems for health has become a popular topic within the RecSys community and a selection of em-pirical contributions and demo systems have been published. Efforts to date, however have been sporadic and lack coor-dination. We lack shared infrastructure such as datasets, appropriate cross-disciplinary knowledge, even agreed upon goals. The aim of this workshop was to use is as a vehicle to:
The topics of specific interest to the workshop were:
In total 5 papers were accepted to the workshop.
We thank the RecSys 2016 organizing committee for giv-ing us the opportunity to host this workshop in conjunction with RecSys 2016 in Boston, MA, USA. We would also like to thank the authors, presenters, and reviewers, whose ef-forts made the workshop possible. The organizers are sup-ported in part by the Enable Cluster (BMBF, Funding num-ber: 01EA1409H) and the Know-Center. The KnowCenter is funded within the Austrian COMET Program -managed by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG). [1] S. Abbar, Y. Mejova, and I. Weber. You tweet what [2] M. D. Choudhury, S. S.
