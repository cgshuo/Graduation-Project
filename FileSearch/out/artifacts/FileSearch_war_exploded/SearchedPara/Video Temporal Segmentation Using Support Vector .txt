 meaningful and manageable segments (shots) that are used as basic elements for indexing. A video shot is defined as a series of interrelated consecutive frames taken contiguously by a single camera and representing a continuous action in time and analysis. According to whether the transition between shots is abrupt or not, the shot boundaries are categorized into two types: cuts and gradual transitions. Abrupt Actually, the content change caused by camera operations, such as object movement, difficult to differentiate between changes caused by a continuous edit effect and those caused by object and camera motion [2]. Many researchers have exploited solutions works introduced above, there still exists a radical problem which has not been settled properly yet. Distinguishing shot change from motions, whether it is a camera motion explore new methods for temporal video segmentation. We propose a video segmentation method based on support vector machines. Videos can be regarded as continuous frame series. We label the frames as shot boundary and non-boundary. Both of them have their own patterns, so the shot boundary detection can be regarded as a problem of pattern recognition. Meanwhile we introduce a texture descriptor called LBP (Local Binary Pattern) to build a new feature. 2.1 Feature Construction Based on LBP each pixel with the center pixel value and considering the result as a binary number. Then the histogram of the labels can be used as a texture descriptor. See Figure 1 for an illustration of the basic LBP operator. 
The video image is divided into local regions and texture descriptors are extracted from each region independently. The descriptors are then concatenated to form a global description of the video image. See Figure 2 for an example of a video image divided into rectangular regions. 
A histogram of the labeled image (, ) l fxy can be defined as in which n is the number of different labels produced by the LBP operator and 
IA = . This histogram contains information about the distribution of the local micro patterns, such as edges, spots and flat areas, over the whole image. For purpose, the image is divided into m regions 01 1 , ,..., m R RR  X  and the spatially enhanced histogram is defined as 2.2 Dissimilarity Measure image. A dissimilarity measure called Cosine Distance can be exploited from the idea can be defined as follows: dimension number of the vector. The cosine distance is basically the dot product of two unit vector. Therefore a small value for being considered are quite dissimilar, while a large similarity. Figure 3 shows a time varying curve of the cosine distance in a video clip which involves several gradual transitions, abrupt transitions, and motions. 3.1 Feature Selection Having obtained the aforementioned curve of cosine distance between frames, each because of some false alarms caused by object or camera motions. In order to accurately classify the potential transitions into the types of CUT and GT,we need to vector, which characterizes the shape of the valleys locating on the curve. Let vector is formally defined by the following equation: where i D is the local minima of a valley. Given a certain value for m, i V is a vector choose m=5 in cut detection and m=10 for gradual transition detection. Feature vectors are inputted for classification by SVM. 3.2 Active Learning Strategy achieve a higher accuracy with a small number of training examples. The active specified threshold from all the available local minima. The valleys collected, the real boundaries are labeled as positive examples, and the false alarms are labeled as negative examples, as shown in Figure 4. Both positive examples and negative constitute the training set. Obviously, all of boundaries will be collected as long as the threshold is low enough. benchmarking platform [9]. Similar to other information retrieval task, the performance is evaluated by recall and precision criteria. Recall measures the capability in detecting correct shot transitions, while precision measures the ability in preventing false alarms. performance of the proposed method. The evaluation results are presented in table 1. way for the content representation of videos. Usually, global histogram is extracted to features and then compare the ability of representation to our proposed features. The performances are depicted in Figure 5. Obviously, our proposed method based on LBP performs better in cut detection and GT detection. New feature based on LBP can describe video frames well. Promising results reveal its effectiveness at the same time. A method for temporal video segmentation is presented. We propose a new feature based on LBP to describe video frame and a measure qualifying the differences between frames. Then a method for cut detection and gradual transitions detection is implemented by SVM. We adopt active learning strategy to improve accuracy of SVM. Promising comparison results encourage our works.
