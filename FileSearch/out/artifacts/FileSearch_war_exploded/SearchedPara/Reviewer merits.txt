We, the undersigned journal editors, hope that you encourage your colleagues to participate in the peer review process, and that you include reviewing as part of your evaluation of scholarly productivity.
The future of scholarly publication elicits active conversation in the academy. Regardless of the policies and technologies that will eventually dominate, the kernel of peer review will surely remain. There are some impor-tant developments occurring that should be recognized by everyone involved in the peer review enterprise. Most publishers are adopting manuscript management systems where authors post electronic versions of their papers, editors select reviewers, reviewers retrieve and post reviews, and editors make and report decisions. These systems maintain detailed information about the entire publication process, including the peer review component. This information is the basis for a variety of reports that publishers and editors can use to im-prove work flow and insure high quality publications. A number of issues are emerging related to mining these data, insuring integrity, and ownership of reviews, however, this note is meant to raise one specific issue and make a plea regarding peer reviewing.

Peer review is crucial to scholarly publication, but it is also the most time-intensive step. Reviewers are asked to volunteer their time to read and write critical and constructive reviews and this takes time. As creative acts, reviews vary greatly in quality, and editors over time come to know reviewers who write thoughtful and timely reviews and those who write causal reviews or refuse to review at all. Electronic manuscript systems easily provide time data for reviewers and some offer rating scales and note fields for editors to evaluate review quality. Many of us (editors) are beginning to use these capabilities and, over time, we will be able to have systematic and persistent reviewer quality data. Graduate students, faculty, chairs, and deans should be aware that these data are held. Our plea to everyone is two-fold:  X  First, please do thoughtful and timely reviews and encourage your colleagues to participate in the peer review process. The future of scholarly publication depends on this!  X  Second, please develop and discuss ways to include reviewing as part of your scholarly productivity assess-ments. Help make peer review a visible part of the reward structure to both recognize critical reviewing as an important scholarly activity as well as bolster its role in the publication process.
