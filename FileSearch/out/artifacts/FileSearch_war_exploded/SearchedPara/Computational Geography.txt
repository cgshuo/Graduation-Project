 As the industry moves to personalization and mobility, users expect their applications to be location savvy, and relevant to their lives in increasing detail. While we can pinpoint a user at a location within 700 meters with just their IP address, and within a meter with their GPS-enabled mo-bile phone, we fall short when it comes to understanding their geographic context. A person X  X  geographic context in-cludes their current and previous location, the things that surround them, their activity in a given place, as well as their thoughts and feelings in that place. Understanding this con-text allows us to personalize their experience and refine their interactions with an application, on a hyper-local level.

The tutorial will cover four basic areas. The first is an overview of how geographies are represented, and how they are organized in gazetteers, using Geonames 1 and GeoPlanet 2 as examples. We discuss the differences between official ge-ographies, and human-centric geographies (such as neigh-borhoods and colloquial places which are often not defined in official sources). We discuss points-of-interest, whose def-inition is frequently application-dependent. For example, a search engine presenting sponsored listings for local search would define a local business or venue as a point-of-interest. A transportation department might be more interested in metro stops, bus stops, and roadways. A tourist recom-mender application, or a mapping application, might define points-of-interest as landmarks, and historic places. www.geonames.org developer.yahoo.com/geo/placemaker
