 PREFACE the logical structure of a set of data into a hierarchical ma-trix. Tabular data consists of discrete data and/or a combi-nation of dependent and independent variables. X  This can be learned from Wikipedia. But we also learn from there that ta-bleshave X ...historicalrelationshiptofurniture:Inmedieval counting houses, the tables were covered with a piece of che-quered cloth, to count money. X  Today, tables are used for many different kinds of information, including, of course, money. What particular combination of features makes a ta-ble, or a form? What is the role of the user in defining these structures (e.g. in industry,  X  X he customer often defines what a table is X )? How is a table different from a list? How is a list different from a Table of Content (TOC)? Does geo-metric alignment of content guarantee a robust structure? Or how much semantic relationship needs to be included within the content to qualify a region as such? What is the role of cross-disciplinary techniques used by Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) communities in understanding tables and forms? These also can be recur-sive, e.g. a table can contain images, lists and even tables. These are only some of the questions that need answering. At the Third International Workshop on Document Layout Interpretation and its Applications (DLIA 2003) 1 the partic-ipants discovered the common interest in tables, so that the discussion group topics were changed to cover tables. This special issue is a result of that observed interest. tion and understanding of tables and forms pose a huge challenge. Detection of tables and forms in electronic docu-ments can be one small part of a series of tasks required for document processing, but often the accuracy of physical and logical layout extraction from these documents depends to a great extent on the accuracy of this solution available to the system. Because errors at this stage tend to get magnified as the subsequent processes are applied in sequence. Beside
