 Psycholinguists have long realized that language comprehension is highly incremental , with readers and listeners continuously extracting the meaning of utterances on a word-by-word basis. As soon as they encounter a word in a sentence, they inte-grate it as fully as possible into a representation of the sentence thus far (Marslen-Wilson 1973; Konieczny 2000; Tanenhaus et al. 1995; Sturt and Lombardo 2005). Recent research suggests that language comprehension can also be highly pre-dictive , i.e., comprehenders are able to anticipate upcoming linguistic material. This is beneficial as it gives them more time to keep up with the in-put, and predictions can be used to compensate for problems with noise or ambiguity.

Two types of prediction have been observed in the literature. The first type is semantic predic-tion, as evidenced in semantic priming: a word that is preceded by a semantically related prime or a semantically congruous sentence fragment is processed faster (Stanovich and West 1981; van Berkum et al. 1999; Clifton et al. 2007). Another example is argument prediction: listeners are able to launch eye-movements to the predicted argu-ment of a verb before having encountered it, e.g., they will fixate an edible object as soon as they hear the word eat (Altmann and Kamide 1999). The second type of prediction is syntactic predic-tion. Comprehenders are faster at naming words that are syntactically compatible with prior con-text, even when they bear no semantic relationship to the context (Wright and Garrett 1984). Another instance of syntactic prediction has been reported by Staub and Clifton (2006): following the word either , readers predict or and the complement that follows it, and process it faster compared to a con-trol condition without either .

Thus, human language processing takes advan-tage of the constraints imposed by the preceding semantic and syntactic context to derive expecta-tions about the upcoming input. Much recent work has focused on developing computational mea-sures of these constraints and expectations. Again, the literature is split into syntactic and semantic models. Probably the best known measure of syn-tactic expectation is surprisal (Hale 2001) which can be coarsely defined as the negative log proba-bility of word w t given the preceding words, typ-ically computed using a probabilistic context-free grammar.

Modeling work on semantic constraint focuses on the degree to which a word is related to its preceding context. Pynte et al. (2008) use La-tent Semantic Analysis (LSA, Landauer and Du-mais 1997) to assess the degree of contextual con-straint exerted on a word by its context. In this framework, word meanings are represented as vec-tors in a high dimensional space and distance in this space is interpreted as an index of process-ing difficulty. Other work (McDonald and Brew 2004) models contextual constraint in information theoretic terms. The assumption is that words carry prior semantic expectations which are up-dated upon seeing the next word. Expectations are represented by a vector of probabilities which re-flects the likely location in semantic space of the upcoming word.

The measures discussed above are typically computed automatically on real-language corpora using data-driven methods and their predictions are verified through analysis of eye-movements that people make while reading. Ample evidence (Rayner 1998) demonstrates that eye-movements are related to the moment-to-moment cognitive ac-tivities of readers. They also provide an accurate temporal record of the on-line processing of nat-ural language, and through the analysis of eye-movement measurements (e.g., the amount of time spent looking at a word) can give insight into the processing difficulty involved in reading.

In this paper, we investigate a model of predic-tion that is incremental and takes into account syn-tactic as well as semantic constraint. The model essentially integrates the predictions of an incre-mental parser (Roark 2001) together with those of a semantic space model (Mitchell and Lap-ata 2009). The latter creates meaning representa-tions compositionally , and therefore builds seman-tic expectations for word sequences (e.g., phrases, sentences, even documents) rather than isolated words. Some existing models of sentence process-ing integrate semantic information into a prob-abilistic parser (Narayanan and Jurafsky 2002; Pad  X  o et al. 2009); however, the semantic compo-nent of these models is limited to semantic role in-formation, rather than attempting to build a full se-mantic representation for a sentence. Furthermore, the models of Narayanan and Jurafsky (2002) and Pad  X  o et al. (2009) do not explicitly model pre-diction, but rather focus on accounting for garden path effects. The proposed model simultaneously captures semantic and syntactic effects in a sin-gle measure which we empirically show is predic-tive of processing difficulty as manifested in eye-movements. As described in Section 1, reading times provide an insight into the various cognitive activities that contribute to the overall processing difficulty in-volved in comprehending a written text. To quan-tify and understand the overall cognitive load asso-ciated with processing a word in context, we will break that load down into a sum of terms repre-senting distinct computational costs (semantic and syntactic). For example, surprisal can be thought of as measuring the cost of dealing with unex-pected input. When a word conforms to the lan-guage processor X  X  expectations, surprisal is low, and the cognitive load associated with processing that input will also be low. In contrast, unexpected words will have a high surprisal and a high cogni-tive cost.

However, high-level syntactic and semantic fac-tors are only one source of cognitive costs. A siz-able proportion of the variance in reading times is accounted for by costs associated with low-level features of the stimuli, e.g.. relating to orthography and eye-movement control (Rayner 1998). In ad-dition, there may also be costs associated with the integration of new input into an incremental rep-resentation. Dependency Locality Theory (DLT, Gibson 2000) is essentially a distance-based mea-sure of the amount of processing effort required when the head of a phrase is integrated with its syntactic dependents. We do not consider integra-tion costs here (as they have not been shown to correlate reliably with reading times; see Demberg and Keller 2008 for details) and instead focus on the costs associated with semantic and syntactic constraint and low-level features, which appear to make the most substantial contributions.

In the following subsections we describe the various features which contribute to the process-ing costs of a word in context. We begin by look-ing at the low-level costs and move on to con-sider the costs associated with syntactic and se-mantic constraint. For readers unfamiliar with the methodology involved in modeling eye-tracking data, we note that regression analysis (or the more general mixed effects models) is typically used to study the relationship between dependent and in-dependent variables. The independent variables are the various costs of processing effort and the dependent variables are measurements of eye-movements, three of which are routinely used in the literature: first fixation duration (the duration of the first fixation on a word regardless of whether it is the first fixation on a word or the first of mul-tiple fixations on the same word), first pass dura-tion , also known as gaze duration , (the sum of all fixations made on a word prior to looking at an-other word), and total reading time (the sum of all fixations on a word including refixations after moving on to other words). 2.1 Low-level Costs Low-level features include word frequency (more frequent words are read faster), word length (shorter words are read faster), and the position of the word in the sentence (later words are read faster). Oculomotor variables have also been found to influence reading times. These include previous fixation (indicating whether or not the previous word has been fixated), launch distance (how many characters intervene between the cur-rent fixation and the previous fixation), and land-ing position (which letter in the word the fixation landed on).

Information about the sequential context of a word can also influence reading times. Mc-Donald and Shillcock (2003) show that forward and backward transitional probabilities are pre-dictive of first fixation and first pass durations: the higher the transitional probability, the shorter the fixation time. Backward transitional prob-ability is essentially the conditional probabil-ity of a word given its immediately preceding word, P ( w k | w k  X  1 ) . Analogously, forward proba-bility is the conditional probability of the current word given the next word, P ( w k | w k + 1 ) . 2.2 Syntactic Constraint As mentioned earlier, surprisal (Hale 2001; Levy 2008) is one of the best known models of process-ing difficulty associated with syntactic constraint, and has been previously applied to the modeling of reading times (Demberg and Keller 2008; Ferrara Boston et al. 2008; Roark et al. 2009; Frank 2009). The basic idea is that the processing costs relating to the expectations of the language processor can be expressed in terms of the probabilities assigned by some form of language model to the input. These processing costs are assumed to arise from the change in the expectations of the language pro-cessor as new input arrives. If we express these ex-pectations in terms of a distribution over all possi-ble continuations of the input seen so far, then we can measure the magnitude of this change in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the old dis-tribution to the updated distribution. This measure of processing cost for an input word, w k + 1 , given the previous context, w 1 ... w k , can be expressed straightforwardly in terms of its conditional prob-ability as: That is, the processing cost for a word decreases as its probability increases, with zero processing cost incurred for words which must appear in a given context, as these do not result in any change in the expectations of the language processor.

The original formulation of surprisal (Hale 2001) used a probabilistic parser to calculate these probabilities, as the emphasis was on the process-ing costs incurred when parsing structurally am-biguous garden path sentences. 1 Several variants of calculating surprisal have been developed in the literature since using different parsing strategies (e.g., left-to-right vs. top-down, PCFGs vs de-pendency parsing) and different degrees of lexi-calization (see Roark et al. 2009 for an overview) . For instance, unlexicalized surprisal can be easily derived by substituting the words in Equation (1) with parts of speech (Demberg and Keller 2008). Surprisal could be also defined using a vanilla language model that does not take any structural or grammatical information into account (Frank 2009). 2.3 Semantic Constraint Distributional models of meaning have been com-monly used to quantify the semantic relation be-tween a word and its context in computational studies of lexical processing. These models are based on the idea that words with similar mean-ings will be found in similar contexts. In putting this idea into practice, the meaning of a word is then represented as a vector in a high dimensional space, with the vector components relating to the strength on occurrence of that word in various types of context. Semantic similarities are then modeled in terms of geometric similarities within the space.
 To give a concrete example, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA, Landauer and Dumais 1997) cre-ates a meaning representation for words by con-structing a word-document co-occurrence matrix from a large collection of documents. Each row in the matrix represents a word, each column a doc-ument, and each entry the frequency with which the word appeared within that document. Because this matrix tends to be quite large it is often trans-formed via a singular value decomposition (Berry et al. 1995) into three component matrices: a ma-trix of word vectors, a matrix of document vectors, and a diagonal matrix containing singular values. Re-multiplying these matrices together using only the initial portions of each (corresponding to the use of a lower dimensional spatial representation) produces a tractable approximation to the original matrix. In this framework, the similarity between two words can be easily quantified, e.g., by mea-suring the cosine of the angle of the vectors repre-senting them.

As LSA is one the best known semantic space models it comes as no surprise that it has been used to analyze semantic constraint. Pynte et al. (2008) measure the similarity between the next word and its preceding context under the assump-tion that high similarity indicates high semantic constraint (i.e., the word was expected) and analo-gously low similarity indicates low semantic con-straint (i.e., the word was unexpected). They oper-ationalize preceding contexts in two ways, either as the word immediately preceding the next word as the sentence fragment preceding it. Sentence fragments are represented as the average of the words they contain independently of their order. The model takes into account only content words, function words are of little interest here as they can be found in any context.
 Pynte et al. (2008) analyze reading times on the French part of the Dundee corpus (Kennedy and Pynte 2005) and find that word-level LSA similar-ities are predictive of first fixation and first pass durations, whereas sentence-level LSA is only predictive of first pass duration (i.e., for a mea-sure that includes refixation). This latter finding is somewhat counterintuitive, one would expect longer contexts to have an immediate effect as they are presumably more constraining. One rea-son why sentence-level influences are only visible on first pass duration may be due to LSA itself, which is syntax-blind. Another reason relates to the way sentential context was modeled as vec-tor addition (or averaging). The idea of averag-ing is not very attractive from a linguistic perspec-tive as it blends the meanings of individual words together. Ideally, the combination of simple el-ements onto more complex ones must allow the construction of novel meanings which go beyond those of the individual elements (Pinker 1994).
The only other model of semantic constraint we are aware of is Incremental Contextual Distinc-tiveness (ICD, McDonald 2000; McDonald and Brew 2004). ICD assumes that words carry prior semantic expectations which are updated upon seeing the next word. Context is represented by a vector of probabilities which reflects the likely location in semantic space of the upcoming word. When the latter is observed, the prior expecta-tion is updated using a Bayesian inference mecha-nism to reflect the newly arrived information. Like LSA, ICD is based on word co-occurrence vectors, however it does not employ singular value decom-position, and constructs a word-word rather than a word-document co-occurrence matrix. Although this model has been shown to successfully simu-late single-and multiple-word priming (McDon-ald and Brew 2004), it failed to predict processing costs in the Embra eye-tracking corpus (McDon-ald and Shillcock 2003).

In this work we model semantic constraint us-ing the representational framework put forward in Mitchell and Lapata (2008). Their aim is not so much to model processing difficulty, but to con-struct vector-based meaning representations that go beyond individual words. They introduce a general framework for studying vector composi-tion , which they formulate as a function f of two vectors u and v : where h denotes the composition of u and v . Dif-ferent composition models arise, depending on how f is chosen. Assuming that h is a linear func-tion of the Cartesian product of u and v allows to specify additive models which are by far the most common method of vector combination in the lit-erature: Alternatively, we can assume that h is a linear function of the tensor product of u and v , and thus derive models based on multiplication : Mitchell and Lapata (2008) show that several ad-ditive and multiplicative models can be formu-lated under this framework, including the well-known tensor products (Smolensky 1990) and cir-cular convolution (Plate 1995). Importantly, com-position models are not defined with a specific se-mantic space in mind, they could easily be adapted to LSA, or simple co-occurrence vectors, or more sophisticated semantic representations (e.g., Grif-fiths et al. 2007), although admittedly some com-position functions may be better suited for partic-ular semantic spaces.

Composition models can be straightforwardly used as predictors of processing difficulty, again via measuring the cosine of the angle between a vector w representing the upcoming word and a vector h representing the words preceding it: where h is created compositionally, via some (ad-ditive or multiplicative) function f .

In this paper we evaluate additive and compo-sitional models in their ability to capture seman-tic prediction. We also examine the influence of the underlying meaning representations by com-paring a simple semantic space similar to Mc-Donald (2000) against Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al. 2003; Griffiths et al. 2007). Specif-ically, the simpler space is based on word co-occurrence counts; it constructs the vector repre-senting a given target word, t , by identifying all the tokens of t in a corpus and recording the counts of context words, c i (within a specific window). The context words, c i , are limited to a set of the n most common content words and each vector compo-nent is given by the ratio of the probability of a c i given t to the overall probability of c i . Despite its simplicity, the above semantic space (and variants thereof) has been used to success-fully simulate lexical priming (e.g., McDonald 2000), human judgments of semantic similarity (Bullinaria and Levy 2007), and synonymy tests (Pad  X  o and Lapata 2007) such as those included in the Test of English as Foreign Language (TOEFL).
LDA is a probabilistic topic model offering an alternative to spatial semantic representations. It is similar in spirit to LSA, it also operates on a word-document co-occurrence matrix and derives a reduced dimensionality description of words and documents. Whereas in LSA words are repre-sented as points in a multi-dimensional space, LDA represents words using topics. Specifically, each document in a corpus is modeled as a distri-bution over K topics, which are themselves char-acterized as distribution over words. The individ-ual words in a document are generated by repeat-edly sampling a topic according to the topic distri-bution and then sampling a single word from the chosen topic. Under this framework, word mean-ing is represented as a probability distribution over a set of latent topics, essentially a vector whose dimensions correspond to topics and values to the probability of the word given these topics. Topic models have been recently gaining ground as a more structured representation of word meaning (Griffiths et al. 2007; Steyvers and Griffiths 2007). In contrast to more standard semantic space mod-els where word senses are conflated into a single representation, topics have an intuitive correspon-dence to coarse-grained sense distinctions. The treatment of semantic and syntactic constraint in models of processing difficulty has been some-what inconsistent. While surprisal is a theo-retically well-motivated measure, formalizing the idea of linguistic processing being highly predic-tive in terms of probabilistic language models, the measurement of semantic constraint in terms of vector similarities lacks a clear motivation. More-over, the two approaches, surprisal and similarity, produce mathematically different types of mea-sures. Formally, it would be preferable to have a single approach to capturing constraint and the obvious solution is to derive some form of seman-tic surprisal rather than sticking with similarity. This can be achieved by turning a vector model of semantic similarity into a probabilistic language model.

There are in fact a number of approaches to de-riving language models from distributional mod-els of semantics (e.g., Bellegarda 2000; Coccaro and Jurafsky 1998; Gildea and Hofmann 1999). We focus here on the model of Mitchell and La-pata (2009) which tackles the issue of the compo-sition of semantic vectors and also integrates the output of an incremental parser. The core of their model is based on the product of a trigram model p ( w n | w n  X  1 n  X  2 ) and a semantic component  X  ( w which determines the factor by which this proba-bility should be scaled up or down given the prior semantic context h : The factor  X  ( w n , h ) is essentially based on a com-parison between the vector representing the cur-rent word w n and the vector representing the prior history h . Varying the method for constructing word vectors (e.g., using LDA or a simpler seman-tic space model) and for combining them into a representation of the prior context h (e.g., using additive or multiplicative functions) produces dis-tinct models of semantic composition.

The calculation of  X  is then based on a weighted dot product of the vector representing the upcom-ing word w , with the vector representing the prior context h : As shown in Equation (7) this semantic factor then modulates the trigram probabilities, to take ac-count of the effect of the semantic content outside the n -gram window.

Mitchell and Lapata (2009) show that a com-bined semantic-trigram language model derived from this approach and trained on the Wall Street Journal outperforms a baseline trigram model in terms of perplexity on a held out set. They also linearly interpolate this semantic language model with the output of an incremental parser, which computes the following probability: where p 1 ( w | h ) is computed as in Equation (7) and p 2 ( w | h ) is computed by the parser. Their im-plementation uses Roark X  X  (2001) top-down incre-mental parser which estimates the probability of the next word based upon the previous words of the sentence. These prefix probabilities are calcu-lated from a grammar, by considering the likeli-hood of seeing the next word given the possible grammatical relations representing the prior con-text.

Equation (9) essentially defines a language model which combines semantic, syntactic and n -gram structure, and Mitchell and Lapata (2009) demonstrate that it improves further upon a se-mantic language model in terms of perplexity. We argue that the probabilities from this model give us a means to model the incrementally and predic-tivity of the language processor in a manner that integrates both syntactic and semantic constraints. Converting these probabilities to surprisal should result in a single measure of the processing cost as-sociated with semantic and syntactic expectations. Data The models discussed in the previous sec-tion were evaluated against an eye-tracking cor-pus. Specifically, we used the English portion of the Dundee Corpus (Kennedy and Pynte 2005) which contains 20 texts taken from The Indepen-dent newspaper. The corpus consists of 51,502 tokens and 9,776 types in total. It is annotated with the eye-movement records of 10 English na-tive speakers, who each read the whole corpus. The eye-tracking data was preprocessed following the methodology described in Demberg and Keller (2008). From this data, we computed total reading time for each word in the corpus. Our statistical analyses were based on actual reading times, and so we only included words that were not skipped. We also excluded words for which the previous word had been skipped, and words on which the normal left-to-right movement of gaze had been interrupted, i.e., by blinks, regressions, etc. Fi-nally, because our focus is the influence of seman-tic context, we selected only content words whose prior sentential context contained at least two fur-ther content words. The resulting data set con-sisted of 53,704 data points, which is about 10% of the theoretically possible total. 2 Model Implementation All elements of our model were trained on the BLLIP corpus, a col-lection of texts from the Wall Street Journal (years 1987 X 89). The training corpus consisted of 38,521,346 words. We used a development cor-pus of 50,006 words and a test corpus of similar size. All words were converted to lowercase and numbers were replaced with the symbol  X  num  X  . A vocabulary of 20,000 words was chosen and the remaining tokens were replaced with  X  unk  X  .
Following Mitchell and Lapata (2009), we con-structed a simple semantic space based on co-occurrence statistics from the BLLIP training set. We used the 2,000 most frequent word types as contexts and a symmetric five word window. Vec-tor components were defined as in Equation (6). We also trained the LDA model on BLLIP, using the Gibb X  X  sampling procedure discussed in Grif-fiths et al. (2007). We experimented with different numbers of topics on the development set (from 10 to 1,000) and report results on the test set with 100 topics. In our experiments, the hyperparameter  X  was initialized to .5, and the  X  word probabilities were initialized randomly.

We integrated our compositional models with a trigram model which we also trained on BLLIP. The model was built using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke 2002) with backoff and Kneser-Ney smoothing. As our incremental parser we used Roark X  X  (2001) parser trained on sections 2 X 21 of the Penn Treebank containing 936,017 words. The parser produces prefix probabilities for each word of a sentence which we converted to conditional probabilities by dividing each current probability by the previous one.
 Statistical Analysis The statistical analyses in this paper were carried out using linear mixed effects models (LME, Pinheiro and Bates 2000). The latter can be thought of as generalization of linear regression that allows the inclusion of ran-dom factors (such as participants or items) as well as fixed factors (e.g., word frequency). In our analyses, we treat participant as a random factor, which means that our models contain an intercept term for each participant, representing the individ-ual differences in the rates at which they read. 3
We evaluated the effect of adding a factor to a model by comparing the likelihoods of the mod-els with and without that factor. If a  X  2 test on the Table 1: Coefficients of the baseline LME model for total reading time likelihood ratio is significant, then this indicates that the new factor significantly improves model fit. We also experimented with adding random slopes for participant to the model (in addition to the random intercept); however, this either led to non-convergence of the model fitting procedure, or failed to result in an increase in model fit accord-ing to the likelihood ratio test. Therefore, all mod-els reported in the rest of this paper contain ran-dom intercept of participants as the sole random factor.

Rather than model raw reading times, we model times on the log scale. This is desirable for a number of reasons. Firstly, the raw reading times tend to have a skew distribution and taking logs produces something closer to normal, which is preferable for modeling. Secondly, the regres-sion equation makes more sense on the log scale as the contribution of each term to raw reading time is multiplicative rather than additive. That is, the intercept term for each participant now repre-sents a multiplicative factor by which that partici-pant is slower or faster. We computed separate mixed effects models for three dependent variables, namely first fixation du-ration, first pass duration, and total reading time. We report results for total times throughout, as the results of the other two dependent variables are broadly similar. Our strategy was to first con-struct a baseline model of low-level factors influ-encing reading time, and then to take the resid-uals from that model as the dependent variable in subsequent analyses. In this way we removed the effects of low-level factors before investigating the factors associated with syntactic and semantic constraint. This avoids problems with collinear-ity between low-level factors and the factors we are interested in (e.g., trigram probability is highly correlated with word frequency). The baseline model contained the factors word length, word fre-Table 2: Coefficients of LME models including simple semantic space (SSS) or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as factors;  X  X  X  X  p &lt;. 001 quency, launch distance, landing position, and the reading time for the last fixated word, and its pa-rameter estimates are given in Table 1. To further reduce collinearity, we also centered all fixed fac-tors, both in the baseline model, and in the models fitted on the residuals that we report in the follow-ing. Note that some intercorrelations remain be-tween the factors, which we will discuss at the end of Section 5.

Before investigating whether an integrated model of semantic and syntactic constraint im-proves the goodness of fit over the baseline, we ex-amined the influence of semantic constraint alone. This was necessary as compositional models have not been previously used to model processing difficulty. Besides, replicating Pynte et al. X  X  (2008) finding, we were also interested in assess-ing whether the underlying semantic representa-tion (simple semantic space or LDA) and com-position function (additive versus multiplicative) modulate reading times differentially.

We built an LME model that predicted the resid-ual reading times of the baseline model using the similarity scores from our composition models as factors. We then carried out a  X  2 test on the like-lihood ratio of a model only containing the ran-dom factor and the intercept, and a model also containing the semantic factor (cosine similarity). The addition of the semantic factor significantly improves model fit for both the simple semantic space and LDA. This result is observed for both additive and multiplicative composition functions. Our results are summarized in Table 2 which re-ports the coefficients of the four LME models fit-ted against the residuals of the baseline model, to-gether with the p-values of the  X  2 test.

Before evaluating our integrated surprisal mea-sure, we evaluated its components individually in order to tease their contributions apart. For ex-ample, it may be the case that syntactic surprisal is an overwhelmingly better predictor of reading time than semantic surprisal, however we would not be able to detect this by simply adding a factor based on Equation (9) to the baseline model. The

Mult Table 3: Coefficients of nested LME models with the components of SSS or LDA surprisal as fac-tors; only the coefficient of the additional factor at each step are shown integrated surprisal measure can be written as: Where p 2 is the incremental parser probability and p 1 is the product of the semantic component,  X  , and the trigram probability, p . This can be broken down into the sum of two terms: Since the first term,  X  log ( p 1 ) is itself a product it can also be broken down further:
S =  X  log ( p )  X  log (  X  )  X  log (  X  +( 1  X   X  ) Thus, to evaluate the contribution of the three components to the integrated surprisal measure we fitted nested LME models, i.e., we entered these terms one at a time into a mixed effects model and tested the significance of the improvement in model fit for each additional term.

We again start with an LME model that only contains the random factor and the intercept, with the residuals of the baseline models as the depen-dent variable. Considering the trigram model first, we find that adding this factor to the model gives a significant improvement in fit. Also adding the se-mantic component (  X  log (  X  ) ) improves fit further, both for additive and multiplicative composition functions using a simple semantic space. Finally, the addition of the parser probabilities (log (  X  + ( 1  X   X  ) p 2 As far as LDA is concerned, the additive model significantly improves model fit, whereas the mul-tiplicative one does not. These results mirror the findings of Mitchell and Lapata (2009), who report that a multiplicative composition function produced the lowest perplexity for the simple se-mantic space model, whereas an additive function gave the best perplexity for the LDA space. Ta-ble 3 lists the coefficients for the nested models for Table 4: Coefficients of LME models with inte-grated surprisal measure (based on SSS or LDA) as factor all four variants of our semantic constraint mea-sure.

Finally, we built a separate LME model where we added the integrated surprisal measure (see Equation (9)) to the model only containing the ran-dom factor and the intercept (see Table 4). We did this separately for all four versions of the in-tegrated surprisal measure (SSS, LDA; additive, multiplicative). We find that model fit improved significantly all versions of integrated surprisal.
One technical issue that remains to be discussed is collinearity, i.e., intercorrelations between the factors in a model. The presence of collinearity is problematic, as it can render the model fitting procedure unstable; it can also affect the signifi-cance of individual factors. As mentioned in Sec-tion 4 we used two techniques to reduce collinear-ity: residualizing and centering. Table 5 gives an overview of the correlation coefficients for all pairs of factors. It becomes clear that collinear-ity has mostly been removed; there is a remaining relationship between word length and word fre-quency, which is expected as shorter words tend to be more frequent. This correlation is not a prob-lem for our analysis, as it is confined to the base-line model. Furthermore, word frequency and tri-gram probability are highly correlated. Again this is expected, given that the frequencies of unigrams and higher-level n -grams tend to be related. This correlation is taken care of by residualizing, which isolates the two factors: word frequency is part of the baseline model, while trigram probability is part of the separate models that we fit on the resid-uals. All other correlations are small (with coeffi-cients of .27 or less), with one exception: there is a high correlation between the  X  log (  X  ) term and the log (  X  + ( 1  X   X  ) p 2 p LDA model. This collinearity issue may explain the absence of a significant improvement in model fit when these two terms are added to the baseline (see Table 3). SSS Add SSS

Table 5: Intercorrelations between model factors In this paper we investigated the contributions of syntactic and semantic constraint in modeling pro-cessing difficulty. Our work departs from previ-ous approaches in that we propose a single mea-sure which integrates syntactic and semantic fac-tors. Evaluation on an eye-tracking corpus shows that our measure predicts reading time better than a baseline model that captures low-level factors in reading (word length, landing position, etc.). Crucially, we were able to show that the semantic component of our measure improves reading time predictions over and above a model that includes syntactic measures (based on a trigram model and incremental parser). This means that semantic costs are a significant predictor of reading time in addition to the well-known syntactic surprisal.
An open issue is whether a single, integrated measure (as evaluated in Table 4) fits the eye-movement data significantly better than separate measures for trigram, syntactic, and semantic sur-prisal (as evaluated in Table 3. However, we are not able to investigate this hypothesis: our ap-proach to testing the significance of factors re-quires nested models; the log-likelihood test (see Section 4) is only able to establish whether adding a factor to a model improves its fit; it cannot com-pare models with disjunct sets of factors (such as a model containing the integrated surprisal mea-sure and one containing the three separate ones). However, we would argue that a single, integrated measure that captures human predictive process-ing is preferable over a collection of separate mea-sures. It is conceptually simpler (as it is more par-simonious), and is also easier to use in applica-tions (such as readability prediction). Finally, an integrated measure requires less parameters; our definition of surprisal in 12 is simply the sum of the trigram, syntactic, and semantic components. An LME model containing separate factors, on the other hand, requires a coefficient for each of them, and thus has more parameters.

In evaluating our model, we adopted a broad coverage approach using the reading time data from a naturalistic corpus rather than artificially constructed experimental materials. In doing so, we were able to compare different syntactic and semantic costs on the same footing. Previous analyses of semantic constraint have been con-ducted on different eye-tracking corpora (Dundee and Embra Corpus) and on different languages (English, French). Moreover, comparisons of the individual contributions of syntactic and semantic factors were generally absent from the literature. Our analysis showed that both of these factors can be captured by our integrated surprisal measure which is uniformly probabilistic and thus prefer-able to modeling semantic and syntactic costs dis-jointly using a mixture of probabilistic and non-probabilistic measures.

An interesting question is which aspects of se-mantics our model is able to capture, i.e., why does the combination of LSA or LDA representa-tions with an incremental parser yield a better fit of the behavioral data. In the psycholinguistic liter-ature, various types of semantic information have been investigated: lexical semantics (word senses, selectional restrictions, thematic roles), senten-tial semantics (scope, binding), and discourse se-mantics (coreference and coherence); see Keller (2010) of a detailed discussion. We conjecture that our model is mainly capturing lexical semantics (through the vector space representation of words) and sentential semantics (through the multiplica-tion or addition of words). However, discourse coreference effects (such as the ones reported by Altmann and Steedman (1988) and much subse-quent work) are probably not amenable to a treat-ment in terms of vector space semantics; an ex-plicit representation of discourse entities and co-reference relations is required (see Dubey 2010 for a model of human sentence processing that can handle coreference).

A key objective for future work will be to in-vestigate models that integrate semantic constraint with syntactic predictions more tightly. For ex-ample, we could envisage a parser that uses se-mantic representations to guide its search, e.g., by pruning syntactic analyses that have a low seman-tic probability. At the same time, the semantic model should have access to syntactic informa-tion, i.e., the composition of word representations should take their syntactic relationships into ac-count, rather than just linear order.
