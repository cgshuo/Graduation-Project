 The fourth ACM international workshop on cloud data management is held in Maui, Hawaii, USA on October 29, 2012 and co-located with the ACM 21th Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). The main objective of the workshop is to address the challenges of large scale data management based on the cloud co mputing infrastructure. The workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from cloud computing, distributed storag e, query processing, parallel algorithms, data mining, and system analysis, all attendees share common research interests in maximizing performance, reducing cost of cloud data management and enlarging the scale of their endeavors. We have constructed an exciting program of seven refereed papers and four invited keynote talks that will give participants a full dose of emerging research. A. General Literature Algorithms, Management Cloud computing, data management This workshop is dedicated to a ddress the challenges in managing large collections of data in th e cloud computing environment, and identifying information of value to business, science, government, and society. The huge volumes of data in cloud computing environments pose big infrastruct ure challenges, including data storage at Petabyte scale, massively parallel query execution, facilities for analytical processing, and online query processing. Meanwhile, the emergence of large data centers and cluster computers have created a ne w business model, cloud-based computing, where businesses and individuals can rent storage and computing capacities, rather than make significant capital investments to construct and provision large-scale computer facilities. Cloud-based data storag e and management is a rapidly expanding business. Whilst thes e emerging services have This fourth workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in cloud computing and data-intensive system design, programming, parallel algorithms, data management, scientific applications, and information-based applications to maximize performance, minimize cost and improve the scale of their endeavors. Data management is one of the mo st important research areas in cloud computing. Even though incr easing research interests are focused in this area, people still need a forum to exchange their ideas and results. This workshop ai ms to provide such a forum. This workshop also aims to reflect top research progress in the cloud data management area. The workshop is a one-day workshop. We have invited four keynotes, Carlo Curino will give a talk on  X  X enchmarking OLTP/Web Databases in the Cl oud: the OLTP-Bench X , Geoffrey Fox will discuss large scale data analytics on clouds, Ashwin Machanavajjhala will present challenges in enabling social application at scale, and Mohamed Sharaf will introduce data freshness in key-value data stores. We also accept seven research papers to be presented in the workshop. The presentations will be grouped based on topics. Cloud data management presents many challenges, including problems of scale (storing petaby tes of data, providing massively parallel query execution, facilities for analytical processing, and environmental concerns. The CloudDB workshop provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and progress in cloud data manageme nt. We have constructed an exciting program of refereed papers and invited talks that will give participants a full dose of emerging research.
