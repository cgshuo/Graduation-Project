 The World Wide Web has been investigat ed deeply in the past decade because of its explosive growth and significant power in changing the style of people X  X  daily lives. By exploring the link structure of the Web [10], researchers found many exciting characteristics, such as small world [14], highly clustering [14][8] and scale free [1]. Small world means that there is always a relatively short path between any two web pages. And highly clustering means that a web page X  X  neighbors are also probable to become neighbors. Scale free, which is well stud-ied in many scientific areas, means that the probability that a page is pointed by k other pages decays as a power law, following P ( k )  X  k  X   X  , regardless of the scale of the web page collections. With the belief that these characteristics have discovered some principles of web e volution, many generative graph models [1][14] were proposed to illustrate how these characteristics could be reproduced by simple rules.

Although most of the aforementioned works were done on analyzing the link structure of the Web, The Web structure is not only featured by hyperlinks since the URLs also contain rich structural information. By utilizing the direc-tory depth in URLs, one can naturally reconstruct the hierarchical relationships among web pages and represent the Web a s a hyperlinked forest. This concept on the Web has been widely used in many previous works in the literature of web modeling and mining. Ravasz and Barab  X  asi [12] proposed a hierarchical network model. Laura et al [9] proposed a multi-level layer model. Eiron and McCurley [5] gave a widely study on the hierarchical structure of the Web. They proved that the hierarchical structure is closely related to the link structure of the Web.
 Rather than the methodologies employ ed in the above works on hierarchical Web modeling, in this study, we investigated the hierarchical structure of the Web in a more explicit way: we dispatched web pages into certain levels by an-alyzing their URLs and discussed the roles of levels in the hierarchical structure of the Web. As a result, we found several nov el and interesting st atistical charac-teristics of the Web, which have not yet been discovered. First, the distribution of pages over levels has a spindle shape. That is, most web pages locate in the middle levels of the hierarchical Web, so there are much fewer pages in the top and very deep levels. Second, the average i ndegree in each leve l decreases sharply when the level goes down. Third, although the indegree distributions in deeper levels obey the same power law with the global indegree distribution, the top levels show a quite different statistical c haracteristics (les s skewed, which means certain fairness in attracting in-links).

We believe that the aforementioned new discoveries with respect to the levels in the hierarchical structure might also be essential to the Web. By taking use of them, the current web search and mining technologies [2][3][7] could be improved and thus better services to the web users could be provided.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we analyzed the hierarchical structure of the Web. In Sect ion 3, we exhibited the level-dependent characteristics through the statistics on well-known webpage collections and tried to give our explanations to them. In Section 4, we gave the conclusions and future work discussions. Most of the artificial complex systems are organized with the hierarchical struc-tures [13], such as geographical districts, governmental branches and so on. It is not only for the feasibility of searching but also for the efficiency of admin-istration. As one of the artificial complex systems, since its birthday, the Web has been constructed and organized with a hierarchical structure. In this sec-tion, we presented the exhibition of the hierarchical structure of the Web and then described how we reconstructed the hierarchical Web from the experimental datasets.
 2.1 Hierarchical Structure of the Web Firstly, the Web can be divided int o a number of domains according to the services, such as .com , .edu and so on. After that, each domain can be further divided into many sub domains, such as microsoft.com , ibm.com and so on. As a result, the domain system forms a hierarchical structure. Although these divisions are engaged for the convenience of management at the very beginning, their senses have gone far beyond that.

Secondly, from another point of view, the Web actually consists of large num-bers of websites, each of which is organized with hierarchical tree structure. For example, a piece of the sitemap of http://www.nhmfl.gov/ is shown in Fig. 1. Obviously, the site in this figure is divided into five levels, where the portal of the website corresponds to the first level (denoted by Level 1). For other pages, their levels will be determined by their relationship with the portal page. Intuitively, we can get their level properties as shown in Fig. 1.

As the Web is hierarchical and we can clearly define the levels in the hier-archical structure, we believe that there must be some novel level-dependent characteristics. To verify this, we conducted some statistics over two well-known web page collections. 2.2 Datasets and Mapping Strategy Our statistics were conducted over two well-known benchmark datasets for TREC Web track, the .GOV corpus and the .GOV2 corpus. These two corpora were both crawled from the  X .gov X  domain. The first one contains about 1M web pages and the second one contains about 25M ones.

We firstly got the indegree distributions of the two corpora as shown in Fig. 2 in order to justify whether the datasets are representative. From this figure, we can clearly see that the indegree distributions indeed follow the power law with an exponent  X  =2 . 0  X  0 . 1. This result is quite in accordance with the previous conclusions [3], where  X  is around 2.1. Thus, we are confident that the datasets are representative and the statistical results on them are convincing.
In order to mine level-dependent characteristics, we adopted the following strategies for URL analysis. Evidently, if a page X  X  URL is formatted like http://www.aaa.com/, it will belong to Level 1. If a page X  X  URL is formatted like http://www.aaa.com/bbb/ , it should belong to Level 2. If all the URLs have such regularity, we will be able to decide the level of a page only by using the number of slashes in its URL. However, the URLs are not always as regular as we hope. To tackle this problem, we designed the following algorithm to extract the level property from the URL information.

Algorithm for Level Extraction 1. URL regularization and Noise Reduction. 2. Level Decision. After dispatching the pages to a hierarchical structure by the algorithm proposed in Section 2.2, we found that there are totally 17 levels in the .GOV corpus and 21 levels in the .GOV2 corpus. In each dataset, the first ten levels contain more 90% pages so that in the latter paragraphs we will only show the features of the first ten levels in the visualizat ion of the statistical results.
 3.1 Spindle Distribution of Pages over Levels Our first concern is surly how many pages in each level. Fig. 3 shows our corre-sponding statistical results: the distribution of pages with respect to levels has a spindle shape. That is, there is a dominative level in the middle of the hier-archical structure containing the most pages (the fifth level in the .GOV corpus and the seventh level in the .GOV2 corpus), and starting from this dominative level, the proportion of page numbers decr eases when going to either the higher or the deeper levels. For example, in Fig. 3(a), we can see that over 85% pages reside in the middle four levels (3, 4, 5 and 6) while in Fig. 3(b) over 70% pages reside in the middle five levels (4, 5, 6, 7 and 8).

As we know, a page may have several child pages in the hierarchical struc-ture. Therefore, it seems that the total number of pages in each level should always increase when the level goes down . However, our statistical results on real datasets do not support this imagination. Actually, the Web does not look like a triangle but like a spindle.

As for the gap between imagination and real statistics, we provided our ex-planation to this from the viewpoint of the evolution of the Web. Suppose the Web grows in an incremental manner that new pages are added one by one. In the initial state, there is only a virtua l page located in Level 0 which is above the first level. During the growth of the Web, new pages will be created in different levels with different probabilities. Since in the hierarchical structure, there is definite parent-child relationship among the pages, we had better decide who its parent is when adding a new page. It can be proved that a spindle distribution of page numbers will be generated if the parent selection of a new page is fair to all the existing pages. This could be r epresented by the following theorem. Theorem 1. If the probability that a new page is put in Level i is proportional to the number of pages in Level i-1 (this is equivalent to that the existing pages will get a new child with the same probability), the distribution of pages with respect to levels will have a spindle shape. In particular, it will obey a Poisson distribution. Proof. Let X i denote the number of pages in Level i . According to the growth rule, there are totally t pages at time t . The growth rate of X i is This equation can be considered to be a generative Polya X  X  urn model[4]. Because Level 0 always contains one virtual page, we can easily get With these initial conditions, we can get the general solution of X i as follows. In the time t , the proportion of the pages in Level k is As one can see, P ( k ) is exactly a Poisson distribution with  X  =ln t . Actually, it is really an interesting conclusion that the uneven distribution is caused by a fair generative process. Base d on this characteristic and the corre-sponding explanation, we might say that the Web is not always dominated by the law of rich-get-richer [1], sometimes there are also some fair aspects [11]. 3.2 Decreasing Average Indegree Along with the Increasing Level The spindle distribution tells us that the number of pages in the high levels is small. Then a next question is whether the number of in-links in these levels is also small. Our statistics show a negative answer to this question that the average indegree of the high-level pages is much larger than the low-level pages. That is, web authors prefer to point to the pages in the high levels when they create new web pages.

Take the .GOV corpus for example. There are 616 pages and 462,723 in-links in the first level, which is equivalent to about 751 indegrees per page. However, for the fifth level, although it contains 296,500 pages, it only has 2,230,431 in-links, or about 7.5 indegrees per page. Overall speaking, when the level goes down, the average indegree decreases sharply. The same conclusion can also be obtained from the .GOV2 corpus. If we plot the average indegree in a double logarithm coordinate, it is nearly a straight line (see Fig. 4(a)(b)) . In other words, the average indegree over levels has a smoothed power law form.
As for the power law form, although we may have thought of the advantage of the high-level pages in attracting hyperlinks, we may not think that the difference is so significant that it almost obeys a power law. Actually, the top 5 levels have attracted more than 80% in-links. In other words, a random surfer will visit the top-5-level pages with a very high probability thus the pages in these levels will have very high popularity or importance.

As for the term  X  X moothed X , we are meaning that the tail of the curve does not match a power law exactly. We believe that it is because of the navigational link. As we known, in the Web, a part of hyperlinks are created only for the navigation purpose, but not for endorsement. These hyperlinks are usually referred to as navigational links. Even if the number of pr eferentially attach ed links decreases sharply when the level goes down, the number of navigational links may keep stable. As a result, the proportion of navigational links becomes larger and larger when the proportion of preferential links becomes smaller and smaller. Therefore, the curves in Fig. 4(a)(b) are actually smoothed at the tails. If removing the navigational links, the absolute amount of the average indegree in each level decreases evidently. However, it still has a power law form. The experimental result on the .GOV corpus is shown in Fig. 4(c). That is, the predominance of the high-level pages in attracting links can not be affected by removing the navigational links. Furthermore, the average indegree is no long smoothed. It justifies that the in-links of the low-level pages mainly consist of the navigational links. 3.3 Distinct Indegree Distribution in the First Level From Section 3.1 and 3.2, we have found that the top levels in the hierarchical Web have many distinct properties. In this section, we will investigate some more details about the indegree distribution in the top levels, other than only an average value, to see whether the rule of link attachment is also distinct.
In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, we showed the indegree distribution of web pages in each level of the .GOV and the .GOV2 corpora. From these figures, we can find that although the indegree distributions in deeper levels follow the same power law with the global one, the first level is quite different because its exponent is significantly less. As we know, the exponent of the power law distribution can reflect the predominance of rich pages for attracting hyperlinks from other pages. The bigger the exponent is, the more pred ominant the richer are. Therefore, we can predict that the pages in the first level will take rather fairness in attracting new in-links. In other words, the gap between the poor and the rich in the first level is much smaller than that in other levels. There could be several possible explanations to it.

First, as mentioned in Section 3.2, many pages usually have a hyperlink point-ing to the homepage of its website. Therefore, although a homepage might not be very popular, the low-level pages in the same website will still have many hyperlinks pointing to it. As a result, the indegrees of the first-level pages are always very high. After the above arguments, one may have a further question whether this kind of intra-site links al so causes the different exponent of the first level. To validate it, we removed the navigational links once again and re-calculated the number of in-links of the web pages. The corresponding results as shown in Fig. 7 indicate that the indegree distribution of the first level is still very different. Therefore we can come to the conclusion that there must be some other reasons rather than the intra-s ite links that caused the differences.
Then, second, we would like to point out that the artificial factors nowadays might be one of the sounded reasons for the above phenomenon. As we know, today X  X  Web is no longer an environment with fair competition. There are many methods that can increase the indegree of the homepage of a website, such as spam, search engine, paid advertisement, and so on. The webmasters will choose to utilize these methods to make their website browsed by more and more surfers. Note that, in such a way, a website (and its homepage) can become very popular even before it has attracted many in-links. This is surely a crack to the rich get richer concept. This partially explains why the indegree distribution of the first level is so different. Actually this explanation also validates the usefulness of the research works on anti-spam raised in recent years.

To summarize, from the three level-dependent characteristics discovered in this paper, we can get a common knowledge that the pages in each level should not be treated equally, especially for the top levels. Although these three char-acteristics might not portray the hierarchical structure of the Web completely, it has provided several beneficial hints for many web applications [6]. It is def-initely worth finding more such characteristics in the hierarchical structure to further give help to the applications and researches on the Web. In this paper, we explicitly mapped the web pages to a hierarchical structure by their URLs. Exploring the hierarchical structure of the Web, we found three level-biased characteristics of the Web. These characteristi cs, together with our explanations to them, may provide very helpful hints for the current web search and mining technologies. There are still many substantial characteristics undis-covered. We plan to conduct further works on the hierarchical Web and give useful information to other branches of the researches on the Web.
