 Let define the i -th identification error e  X  x i w i ; i  X  1 ; 2, and the parameter error  X  w  X  w 2 w 2 . (9) _ e  X  Ae  X  b  X  w &gt; 2 q 2 , (10) where e  X  X  e 1 , e 2 &gt; , A  X  X  a 1 0 1 a following candidate Lyapunov function:

Lemma 2. Consider system (4), (5), RHONN (6), (7) and the exponentially into a bounded set .

Applying the triangular inequality and defining d 0  X  max  X   X  v ; u  X  X  , the following inequality holds: _

The second goal can be achieved by designing a control law discontinuous control law is derived, which combines block surface such that the resulting sliding mode dynamics is described by a desired linear system. 4.1. Control law in a block controllable form _ x  X  a 1  X  x 1 w 1  X  X  x 2 , _ x  X  a 2 x 2  X  w 21 S  X  w 2  X  X  w 22 S  X  w 1  X  S  X  w 3  X  X  w 23 _ w  X  b 3 cos  X  w 1  X  b 4 w 3  X  E  X  u .

Then, the dynamics for z 2 is given by _ z  X  k 1  X  a 1 e 1  X  x 2  X  a 1  X  a 1 e 1  X  x 2  X  a 2 x 2  X  k 2 z 2  X  z 3 ; k 2 4 0, with k 2 z 2  X  z 3 as the desired dynamics for z 2 , and z  X  f 2  X  v ; x  X  X  w 22 S  X  w 1  X  S  X  w 3  X  , w S  X  w 2  X  X  w 23 :
Therefore, the time derivative of z 3 is expressed by _ z  X  f 3  X  v ; x  X  X  b 5  X  v  X  u , (18) where f  X  v ; x  X  X  @ f 2  X  v ; x  X  continuous control law is defined: u  X  k 3 sign  X  b 5  X  v  X  X  sign  X  z 3  X  . (19) _ z  X  f 3  X  v ; x  X  k 3 j b 5  X  v  X j sign  X  z 3  X  . (20) Using the following Lyapunov function:
V  X  whose time derivative is _
V  X  z 3  X  f 3  X  v ; x  X  k 3 j b 5  X  v  X j sign  X  z 3  X  X  , and assuming that the following bounds are satisfied: j f  X  v ; x  X j q 0 ; q 0 4 0, (22) k j b  X  v  X j q 0  X  d 0 and d 0 4 0, (23) then _
V 3  X  k 3 j b 5  X  v  X j sign  X  z 3  X  z 3  X  f 3  X  v ; x  X  z 3
Hence, a sliding motion on the nonlinear surface z 3  X  0is by the second-order linear system _ z  X  Kz 1 , where z 1  X  X  z 1 z k 4.2. Stability analysis candidate Lyapunov function: where R is a symmetric positive definite matrix and e  X  X  e (4) X (7), (13) and (20), it yields _ V  X  e &gt; Qe z 1 Sz 1  X  z 3  X  f 3  X  v ; x  X  k 3 j b 5  X  v the time derivative _ V satisfies the following inequality _ V e &gt; Qe z &gt; 1 Sz 1 d 0 j z 3 j . (25)  X  e modeling errors are not zero but bounded. The proof is straightforward (see Lemma 2).
