We have investigated two research questions in this article: 1. What level of document granularity do searchers judge to be the most relevant? 2. In what order do searchers interact with and judge the relevance of elements of different granularity? 2.

 Appendix Simulated work tasks at INEX 2005
Task ID: C1: One of your friends has recently bought a small handheld
Global Positioning System (GPS) unit, and the possibilities offered by this technology have caught your interest. You would like to explore new killer applications for mobile devices. Therefore, you are looking for examples and descriptions of applications that use GPS, for devices such as mobile phones, PDAs (Personal Desktop Assistants) and other wireless and mobile devices.

Find, for instance, information that discusses examples of how applications that use GPS can be used to accomplish new tasks or provide new services.
 Appendix ( continued )
Task ID: G1: New anti-terrorism laws allow intelligence agencies like the
FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) and CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) to monitor computer communi-cations to spot suspected criminals and terrorists. You would like to find information about how this affects your own and other people X  X  privacy and to know what concerns have been raised.

Find, for instance, information that discusses the Carnivore or Echelon projects or other similar surveillance of computer communication.
