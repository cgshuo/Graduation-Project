 Recommender systems are used by e-commerce sites to suggest products and to pro-vide consumers with information to help them decide which products to purchase. Due to an explosion of e-commerce, recommender systems are rapidly becoming a core tool for accelerating cross-selling and strengthening customer loyalty. Collabora-tive filtering (CF) is the most successful recommendation technique, which has been used in a number of different applications such as recommending movies, articles, products, Web pages [5]. CF is a general approach to personalized information filter-ing. CF systems work by collecting user feedback in the form of ratings for items in a eral users in determining how to recommend an item [3, 2]. 
Finding neighbors in traditional CF is crucial for accurate recommendations be-cause recommendations are based on the ratings of an active user X  X  neighbors. But the current CF algorithms are not adaptive to these situations dynamically, which results in the false recommendations. Our research focuses on these situations. 
This paper presents a new approach to collaborative filtering based on dynamic filtering for finding the fuzzy cluster at different timeframes. We propose the dynamic degree of membership and determine the neighborhood for a given user based on the dynamic fuzzy cluster. The proposed model is expected to find the active user X  X  neighbors dynamically according to his or her changing pattern by using dynamic fuzzy cluster and improve recommendations. The most widely used fuzzy clustering algorithm is the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algo-rithm proposed by Bezdek [1,6]. FCM is a clustering method in which an object can function J defined as follows: where n is the number of individuals to be clustered, c is the number of clusters and control the fuzziness of membership of each datum. between j x and i v . The FCM algorithm is as follows: 
Step 1. Initialize ij u by generating random numbers in the interval [0, 1] such that

Input data of a CF problem is usually a user-to-rating matrix. In order to detect the frames. As shown in Table 1, each row is too sparse. To solve this problem, input data reduction (item dimension reduction) methods are needed. In this paper, we use a higher-level category to reduce the dimension of input data space. category as follows [7]. user A. These derived ratings of non-leaf level nodes are incorporated in computing the fuzzy cluster at different timeframes. Table 2 shows an example of category ratings. 
Customers with similar interests are clustered by the FCM algorithms and this out-put is used as a base for detecting dynami c cluster change. In the FCM process, cate-order to extend the FCM into the dynamic FCM. Fuzzy cluster, defined as the degree of membership ij u , is computed in this step. Crisp cluster of a given user is also de-termined. Crisp cluster of a given user j (CC j ) is defined as the cluster with the largest degree of membership for a given user as follows. time-variant pattern. Sum of degree of membership ( where w(t) is the weighting function which is used to weight timeframe. Dynamic degree of membership of individual j in cluster i ( fined as follows. We select neighbors among users in the cluster i where the dynamic degree of mem-bership of active user ( cluster is proportional to rative filtering algorithm is used to generate recommendation from that. We conducted experiments to evaluate the proposed model. For experiments we used the EachMovie database, provided by Compaq Systems Research Center (http://www.research.compaq.com/SRC/eachmov ie). We assumed that the items are frames. In this experiment we used genre data as category information. We used MAE(Mean Absolute Error) as our choice of evaluation metric to report prediction experiments because it is commonly used and easy to interpret.. 
First we selected 1200 users with more than 100 rated items. We divided the data set into a training set and a test portion. To compare the performance of the proposed dynamic fuzzy cluster based CF (DFCF) algorithm we used the traditional CF (TCF) algorithm as the benchmark model. The traditional CF recommendation employs the Pearson nearest neighbor algorithm. We also experimented using both fuzzy CF (FCF) algorithm and crisp cluster based CF (CCF) algorithm. In CCF algorithm, crisp cluster is determined by using Eq.(6) and the degree of membership in the crisp clus-ter is defined as 1 while the degree of membership in other clusters is zero. 
Table 3 presents the performance of the competing models according to the metric of MAE of recommendation. It can be observed that the proposed dynamic fuzzy cluster based CF algorithm outperforms the traditional CF algorithm. When the num-ber of cluster is 7, the performance of the proposed model is best. When the number of clusters is 7, prediction quality of the FCF is worse than TCF but the difference is small while prediction quality of CCF is worst. It can also be observed from the table that as the number of clusters increase the quality tends to be inferior in case of CCF. statistically significant. DFCF reflects bette r user preference than other models at the 5% significance level. These results show that the proposed DFCF algorithm is more accurate than the traditional CF algorithm. Due to the explosion of e-commerce, reco mmender systems are rapidly becoming a cused on improving the performance of recommender system by dynamic fuzzy clus-tering. We modified the FCM algorithm and applied it to CF for dynamic recommen-dations. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the proposed model on the Each-Movie data set and compared them with the traditional CF algorithm. The results show the proposed model X  X  improvement in making recommendations. 
In this paper, we applied the concept of time to CF algorithm and proposed a new model which is adaptive to users' changing patterns. In our future work, we intend to evaluate our model using other data set. We would also like to develop a model con-sidering the change in cluster structure.
