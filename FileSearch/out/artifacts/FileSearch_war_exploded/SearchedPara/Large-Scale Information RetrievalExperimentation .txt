 This tutorial aims to provide a practical introduction to con-ducting large-scale information retrieval (IR) experiments, Java, Terrier provides an open-source, feature-rich, flexible, and robust environment for large-scale IR experimentation. This tutorial will cover the experimentation process end-to-end, from configuring Terrier to a particular experimen-tal setting, to efficiently indexing a document corpus and retrieving from it, and to evaluating the outcome. More-over, it will describe how to use and extend the platform to one X  X  own needs, and will be illustrated by practical research-driven examples. As a half-day tutorial, it will be split into two major sessions, with each session comprising both back-ground information and practical demonstrations. In the first session, we will provide an overview of several aspects of large-scale IR experimentation, spanning areas such as in-dexing, data structures, query languages, and advanced re-trieval models, and how these are implemented within Ter-rier. In the second session, we will discuss how to extend Terrier to conduct one X  X  own experiments in a large-scale setting, including how to facilitate the evaluation of non-standard IR tasks through crowdsourcing. The practical demonstrations will cover recent use cases identified from Terrier X  X  online discussion forum, so as to provide attendees with concrete examples of what can be done within Terrier.

He holds a BSc (2005) and an MSc (2007) degrees from the Dept. of Computer Sci-ence of the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. As a member of the Terrier Team since 2008, he has extensive experience in Terrier, extending it to a variety of application domains. These include blog search, opinion retrieval, ex-pert search, entity search, Web mining, search result diver-sification, and learning-to-rank. Rodrygo has published sev-eral papers in major IR conferences and journals using Ter-rier, including SIGIR, WWW, CIKM, ECIR, RIAO, ICTIR, IP&amp;M and the IR Journal, as well as international evalua-tion forums, such as TREC and NTCIR.
 Richard McCreadie is a PhD student at the School of Com-puting Science of the University of Glasgow. He holds a BSc (Hons) from the University of Glasgow (2008) and is a mem-ber of the Terrier Team since 2008. In particular, he has de-veloped the MapReduce indexing functionality for massive-scale IR that Terrier currently supports. His work using Ter-rier has been published in several major IR conferences and journals, such as SIGIR, RIAO, and IP&amp;M, as well as on the TREC evaluation forum. Furthermore, Richard is also an expert in crowdsourcing solutions to common IR problems. He has presented new crowdsourcing approaches at the in-fluential crowdsourcing workshops CSE 2010 (SIGIR) and CSDM 2011 (WSDM). Moreover, he designed, implemented and validated the first successful instance of crowdsourcing relevance assessments for TREC during 2010.
 Dr. Vassilis Plachouras is a researcher at PRESANS, a start-up company from  X  Ecole Polytechnique (France). He holds a BEng degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens (2001), a PhD in IR from the University of Glasgow (2006), and has worked as a post-doctoral researcher on Web search at Yahoo! Re-search, Spain. His research interests include Web IR, ar-chitectures for large-scale Web search engines, online adver-tising, and the applications of machine learning for ranking and classification. His publications include over 30 articles in peer-reviewed journals and international conferences, and he has received the best-paper award in CIKM 2009. He has served as a PC member of major international conferences and journals, and as the workshops and tutorials PC chair of ECIR 2008. Moreover, he organised the Workshop for Large-Scale and Distributed Systems for IR (LSDS-IR X 07) in SIGIR 2007. He has been involved in the design and development of Terrier since its inception.
