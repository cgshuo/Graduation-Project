As an increasing number of medical professionals move their patients X  records from paper to computer, enormous amounts of electronic medical records (EMR) have become available for medical research. Some of the EMR data are well-structured, for which traditional database management systems can provide effective retrieval and management func-tions. However, most of the EMR data (such as progress notes and consultation letters) are in free text formats. How to effectively and efficiently retrieve and discover useful in-formation from the vast amount of such semi-structured data is a challenge faced by medical professionals. With-out proper tools, the rich information and knowledge buried in the medical health records are unavailable for clinical re-search and decision-making.

The objective of our research is to develop text analyt-ics tools that are capable of parsing clinical medical data so that predefined search subjects that correspond to a list of medical diagnoses can be extracted. In addition to this particular core functionality, it is also desired that several important assets should be present within the text-analytics tools in order to improve its overall ability to be used as rec-ommendation tools.
 In this research, we work with research scientists at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) in Toronto and examine a number of techniques for structuring and pro-cessing free text documents in order to effectively and effi-ciently search and analyze vast amount of medical records. We implement several powerful medical text analytics tools for clinical data searching and classification. For data clas-sification, our tools sort through a great amount of patient records to identify the likelihood of a patient having my-ocardial infarction (MI) or hypertension (HTN), and clas-sify the patients accordingly. Our tools can also identify the likelihood of a patient being a smoker, previous smoker or non-smoker based on the text data of medical records. All the algorithms and domain knowledge implemented in these tools were provided by medical doctors and domain experts
