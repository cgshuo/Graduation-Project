 Kadri Muischnek  X  Heiki-Jaan Kaalep Abstract This article focuses on the variability of one of the subtypes of multi-word expressions, namely those consisting of a verb and a particle or a verb and its complement(s). We build on evidence from Estonian, an agglutinative language with free word order, analysing the behaviour of verbal multi-word expressions (opaque and transparent idioms, support verb constructions and particle verbs). Using this data we analyse such phenomena as the order of the components of a multi-word expression, lexical substitution and morphosyntactic flexibility.

They have a number of specific properties due to which MWEs do not fit into the grammatical formalisms that derive from the properties of  X  X rdinary X  lexical items.

A great deal of attention has been paid in linguistics and computational towards corpus-based research (e.g. Moon 1998 ; Riehemann 2001 ; Fellbaum 2007a ) that has shed new light on the behaviour of multi-word expressions, especially on that of idioms. A useful overview is Fellbaum ( 2007b ). In computational linguistics, the problem of MWEs has been a self-contained research topic; the motivation for research has been figuratively presented in the title of the influential paper by Sag et al. ( 2002 ):  X  X  X ultiword Expressions: A Pain in the Neck for NLP X  X .

The computational treatment of MWEs can be further divided into several subtasks. First, one has to extract the multi-word expressions from text corpora to obtain a list of possible MWEs. This step is the one that has received most attention in the literature; Evert ( 2005 ) gives a thorough overview. Little research has been done on the extraction of Estonian MWEs. Dias et al. ( 2001 ) report on the implementation of an association measure called Mutual Expectation (ME) for extracting verbal MWEs from Estonian texts.

Expanding MWE lists into a database can be regarded as a second subtask. This step involves dividing the MWEs into subgroups and deciding on the possible architecture of the database and on the types of information to be possibly encoded in the database. Villavicencio et al. ( 2004 ) give an overview of the different strategies for encoding MWEs in different lexical resources. Kaalep and Muischnek ( 2008 ) describe the architecture of a database of Estonian MWEs.

The third subtask includes finding and annotating the MWEs listed in a database syntactic analysis; a pre-processing step in machine translation, etc. Baptista et al. ( 2004 ) present an electronic dictionary of Portuguese MWEs (they use the term frozen sentences ) and describe the identification of these MWEs in texts. Algeria et al. ( 2004 ) introduce a database-based tool for treatment of multiword lexical units in Basque and give a brief overview of previous research in this field.

This article presents the conclusions of corpus-based research carried out as a means of discovering regularities in the behaviour of verb-phrase MWEs in computational treatment of the MWEs, as knowledge concerning the variability of MWEs in real texts is essential for their extraction and annotation.

In this paper our focus is on the variability of the MWEs. As corpus-based studies of English (e.g. Moon 1998 ; Riehemann 2001 ) have shown, MWEs are more flexible and variable than previously thought. Evidence from other morphologically more complex languages has shown that variability of MWEs is the rule rather than the exception. Algeria et al. ( 2004 ), approaching the problem from the viewpoint of computational linguistics, state that in Basque MWEs show significant morpho-variability of Turkish MWEs is, however, subject to certain morphosyntactic constraints. Villavicencio et al. ( 2004 ) stress the importance of relevant methods for dealing with the flexibility of MWEs and the complex interrelations that may be found between their components. More detailed discussion of the relevant related research will be given in the sections of this article that discuss the subtypes of the variability of MWEs.
 The general, non-language-specific idea of this article is that the variation of MWEs can be regular (e.g. the object case variation in Estonian support verb constructions as described in Sect. 4.2.3 ) and determined by the overall meaning of the clause. For non-idiomatic constructions, this variation is mostly predictable, whilst it becomes less predictable for (transparent) idiomatic expressions (e.g. case alternation of the object in Estonian VP idioms as described in Sect. 4.1.4 ).
Languages differ with respect to what components and what grammatical features of MWEs can vary, and what components and features remain frozen. E.g. a prototypical English VP idiom does not alternate between active and passive voice, and consequently, passivisation can be used as an indicator for non-idiomaticity, whilst its absence can be exploited in automatic extraction of MWEs and their classification. However, this indicator is language-specific, as shown in Sect. 4.1 .

On the basis of the syntactic structure of the MWEs, one can distinguish between nominal groups (e.g. a dead loss , trial and error ), adverbial MWEs (e.g. by the way ) and verb phrase multi-word expressions (e.g. kick the bucket , take a walk , pay attention ), among others. This article will focus on one of these subtypes of MWEs, namely, those consisting of a verb and a particle or a verb and its complement(s). Among these verbal MWEs, we distinguish between opaque and transparent idiomatic expressions, support verb constructions and particle verbs. From the broad class of collocations we analyse only the subclass of support (or light) verb constructions. The linguistic properties and computational treatment of other verb-noun collocations remain outside the scope of this paper.

The main purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the behaviour of these verb-phrase MWEs in Estonian as registered in a text corpus of 300,000 words. The corpus contains 8,200 instances (tokens) and 3,500 types of multiword verbs. They were annotated semi-automatically in a previously morphologically tagged text and checked manually by two annotators working on the same text in parallel. Based on this data, we analyse such phenomena as the order of the components of a verb-phrase MWE, lexical substitution, and morphosyntactic variation.
 While discussing the morphosyntactic variation of the nominal components of MWEs, we refer to the  X  X anonical form X  of the expression as a kind of baseline. The canonical form is the form of the expression listed in the database of Estonian verbal MWEs described in more detail in (Kaalep and Muischnek 2008 ).

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 we give a brief overview of the types of MWEs analysed in this paper and some of the relevant problems discussed in literature. Sect. 3 consists of an introduction to the topics in Estonian grammar essential for understanding the discussion in Sect. 4 . In Sect. 4 we analyse the behaviour of the abovementioned MWEs in a text corpus. The section consists of three subsections that contain the analysis of idioms, support verb constructions and particle verbs, respectively. With regard to both idioms and support verb constructions we look at the flexibility of the nominal component in great detail: we analyse the modification and case and/or number alternation of these components. We also analyse lexical variation of idioms. The following section, Sect. 5 , will look at some consequences for the computational treatment of these phenomena. Finally, in Sect. 6 we briefly sum up. 2 Types of multi-word expressions There seems to be a lack of consensus at present in the field of phraseology. Different authors sometimes use the same term for different phenomena, and different terms are sometimes used for the same units (cf. Moon 1998 , pp. 2 X 5; Fleischer 1982 , p. 8). On the other hand, there is general agreement that within the class of MWEs there are no clear-cut borders between the subsets, but that the various types of MWEs instead form a continuum (e.g. Moon 1998 , p. 19).

This article focuses on verb-phrase MWEs, i.e. on constructions that can function as predicates. Among these one can distinguish between constructions consisting of a verb and an adverbial particle and constructions consisting of a verb and a nominal phrase. While the former yields a particle verb, the latter has two subtypes differing in how the meaning of the expression as a whole is constructed from the meanings of the components of the expression, resulting in idiomatic expressions on the one hand and collocations on the other.

Sag et al. ( 2002 ) classify MWEs in decreasing order of lexical rigidity into lexicalised phrases and institutionalised phrases, with the first group further divided into fixed expressions, semi-fixed expressions and syntactically-flexible expres-sions. In English, the fixed expressions comprise immutable expressions that defy conventions of grammar and compositional interpretation, e.g. by and large , every which way . The semi-fixed expressions include non-decomposable idioms (e.g. spill the beans ), compound nominals (e.g. part of speech ) and proper names, all of which are subject to strict constraints on their word order and composition, but undergo some degree of lexical variation. The last group of lexicalised phrases X  syntactically-flexible expressions X  X onsists of verb-particle constructions (e.g. call up ), decomposable idioms (e.g. let the cat out of the bag ) and light verb (=support decomposable idioms is highly unpredictable; the support verb constructions are subject to full syntactic variability.

According to the above criteria, all Estonian verbal MWEs belong to the last group of syntactically-flexible expressions, as the order of their components can vary, the components can be separated from each other by several intervening words, their verbal component can combine with all the morphological categories relevant for the verb, and the nominal components of support verb constructions and some idioms undergo certain case and/or number alternations. See Sect. 4 for more insight into these phenomena.

Based on Schenk ( 1995 ), Gre  X  goire ( 2007 , p. 20), however, argues that in Dutch and other Germanic languages operations that involve movement of the verb are also applicable to the class of semi-flexible expressions. Although Estonian is not a Germanic language, we think it is justifiable to apply this modification to Estonian, too. We therefore classify particle verbs and a subset of idiomatic verb phrases as semi-fixed expressions, with the remaining idiomatic expressions and support verb constructions belonging to the syntactically-flexible expressions.

A more detailed analysis of the MWEs introduced above will be presented later on in this section. 2.1 Idioms There is a vast amount of literature on idioms, but there no consensus on their exact definition (cf. e.g. Moon 1998 , pp. 3 X 5; Nunberg et al. 1994 , p. 492). According to one common interpretation, an idiom is an expression whose meaning cannot be inferred from the meanings of its parts (e.g. Cruse 1986 , p. 37). Nunberg et al. ( 1994 : 492 X 493) define idiom on the basis of six properties with only one, namely conventionality, being obligatory. Conventionality is taken to mean that  X  X heir meaning or use can X  X  be predicted, or at least entirely predicted on the basis of a knowledge of the independent conventions that determine the use of their constituents when they appear in isolation from one another X  (Nunberg et al. 1994 : 492). The other properties are inflexibility, figuration, proverbiality, informality and affect.

Many idioms are syntactically frozen, i.e. they cannot undergo syntactic transformations that are normal for non-idiomatic expressions with the same morphosyntactic structure. For example, an English phrase consisting of a verb and many idioms, e.g. kick the bucket .

A number of ways of subgrouping the set of idiomatic expressions have been discussed in the literature; e.g. idioms have been grouped along the opaque/ transparent divide, meaning that the speaker of a language may be able to item, but he has no chance of understanding an opaque idiom if he has not learned it previously as a form-meaning pair. Opaqueness is also a scalar feature and may be different for different language users.

Nunberg et al. ( 1994 ) distinguish between semantically compositional idioms or idiomatically combining expressions, and semantically non-compositional idioms or idiomatic phrases. These two types of idiomatic expressions have also been called decomposable and non-decomposable idioms (e.g. Riehemann 2001 ). It has been proposed by Nunberg et al. ( 1994 ), and systematically shown by Riehemann ( 2001 ), that at least in English there is a connection between semantic compositionality and lexical variability and/or syntactic flexibility. We shall return to these problems in Sect. 4.1 .

In the corpus underlying this article, the idiomatic expressions have been annotated as either opaque or transparent, allowing us to systematically analyse the difference in Estonian between these two groups. We have addressed the problem of interconnection between semantic compositionality and variability or syntactic flexibility only for a few examples.
 2.2 Support verb constructions Support verb (also called light verb, vector verb, thin verb or delexical verb) constructions are combinations of a verb and its object or some other argument, where the nominal component denotes an action of some kind and the verb itself is semantically empty in this context, e.g. English make a speech , take a walk , arrive at an agreement .

The limits of the set of support verbs vary slightly, depending on the author. One approach (e.g. Cattell 1984 ; Huddleston and Pullum 2002 ) treats only those verb-noun pairs as support verb constructions where the noun is syntactically the object of the verb. Others (e.g. Allerton 2002 ; Krenn 1998 ) also include expressions consisting of a verb plus prepositional phrase, e.g. arrive at an agreement. In this article we treat both kinds of expressions as support verb constructions. As Estonian is an agglutinative language, the relations coded by prepositions in English are coded by oblique cases in Estonian. There are therefore two types of support verb constructions in Estonian: in more frequent cases, the noun denoting action is denoting an action is syntactically some other argument as in (2): (1) Ta pidas ko  X  ne (2) Ministrid jo  X  udsid kokkuleppele
Support verbs can be used to express Aktionsart and causativity (e.g. Danlos 1992 ; Krenn 1998 ). For example, the inchoative aspect is expressed with a support verb bring about in the support verb construction bring about an agreement ; the support verb give has a causative meaning in the sentence This decision gave John hope of getting a job .

A verb omission test has been proposed in order to distinguish between support verb constructions and other types of collocations or idioms (Danlos 1992 ). As the support verb is semantically empty in this context, one can nominalise the support verb construction, omitting the verb: the sentence The chairman made a speech can be nominalised as The chairman X  X  speech , but we cannot nominalise the sentence The chairman pulled the strings as The chairman X  X  strings . 2.3 Particle verbs Particle verbs (also called phrasal verbs) consist of a verb and an adverbial particle (e.g. come on , get up ). For computational treatment, the particle verbs and prepositional verbs (i.e. fixed units of verb and preposition taking a prepositional object, e.g. think about sth or ask for sth ) are sometimes grouped together as  X  X erb-particle constructions X  (e.g. Villavicencio 2003 ; Villavicencio and Copestake 2002 ). In this paper we only address the verb plus adverbial particle constructions and do not analyse the prepositional verbs, though they do occur in Estonian.

Particle verbs can be either idiomatic, e.g. give in or non-idiomatic, e.g. throw out , but most computational approaches do not differentiate between these two variants. In Estonian such a division can be problematic, as the same combination can be polysemous, with both the idiomatic and non-idiomatic readings. For example, the particle verb ette vo  X  tma , lit.  X  X orth take X , has the idiomatic meaning  X  X o undertake X  and the non-idiomatic meaning illustrated by the following sentence: (3) Ta vo  X  tab hunniku ajakirju ette ...

In English, the particle component of some phrasal verbs can be separated from the verb, e.g. She looked the phone number up , while in other phrasal verbs the particle component cannot be detached from the verb, e.g. She ran into an old from the verb (e.g. 3). 3 Some relevant topics in Estonian grammar The Estonian language belongs to the Finnic group of the Finno-Ugric language family. Typologically Estonian is an agglutinative language, but it is more fusional and analytic than the languages belonging to the northern branch of the Finnic group. A detailed description of the grammatical system of Estonian can be found in Erelt 2003 , on which this section is also based.

Basic word order in the normal clause is SVX (i.e. subject X  X erb X  X bject or adverbial), but word order depends on the clause type; pragmatic variants are SXV, XVS, XSV, VXS and VSX) are possible, but statistically SVX and XVS are the dominant types (Tael 1988 ).

Word inflection is the most common way to express the syntactic relations between words and sentence constituents. Nominals, i.e. nouns, adjectives, numerals and pronouns, are inflected for number and case. Modifiers agree with the NP heads in case and number. Estonian has 14 nominal cases, both singular and plural. Three are grammatical cases, namely nominative, genitive and partitive, and there are 11 adverbial cases that perform the same tasks as prefixes or suffixes in many other languages. Finite verb forms are inflected for mood, tense, voice, person and number.
 certain multi-word expressions, it should be mentioned that Estonian has no Indo-European-like proper passive, i.e. subjective action passive. The voice marked by a special morphological form is called impersonal in Estonian grammar. The impersonal clause is subjectless X  X he object is not promoted to the subject, the clause describes an action performed by an indefinite human agent, and can be also derived from intransitive clauses: (4) Mees loeb raamatut -&gt; Loetakse raamatut (5) Mees jookseb -&gt; Joostakse
Thus the main function of the Estonian impersonal passive seems to be the backgrounding of the human subject, rather than the foregrounding of the object.
Aspect does not exist as a verbal grammatical category in Estonian. The aspectual opposition of perfective X  X mperfective is manifested in the clause as a whole. It is expressed partly by grammatical and partly by lexical means. It can be expressed grammatically by nominative/genitive versus partitive forms of the direct object: (6) Mees ehitas suvila (7) Mees ehitas suvilat
The nominative/genitive forms of the direct object are often referred to as  X  X otal object X . A total object is not always sufficient to indicate perfectivity, and therefore prefix-like adverbial particles are also often used, resulting in the formation of particle verbs (8). The same function is performed by adverbials that make the boundary explicit (9): (8) Mees so  X  i supi a  X  ra (9) Mees so  X  i taldriku tu  X  hjaks
The total object is only used with an object denoting a definite quantity (i.e. quantitatively bounded object) and if the clause expresses perfective activity. It is only in affirmative clauses that the total object can alternate with the partial object The total object predominantly occurs in the genitive, but it is in the nominative if the object is in the plural or the verb is in the imperative mood.

Since the nominal component of many verbal multi-word expressions is a syntactic object of the verb, the case alternation of these nominal components is discussed in Sect. 4.1.4 and 4.2.3 . 4 Estonian verbal multi-word expressions in a text corpus In this section we shall analyse the variability of MWEs based on the corpus analysis. Our 300,000-word corpus consists of equal proportions of newspaper, fiction and popular science texts.

We shall analyse the behaviour of three types of verbal multi-word expressions: idioms, support verbs constructions and particle verbs. We divided the class of idioms into two subgroups, i.e. the set of opaque and transparent idioms, respectively. The annotation of opaque versus transparent idioms was carried out before analysing the variability of the expressions and was based on the criterion, whether the annotator would be able to understand the meaning of the idiomatic expression without having previously learnt it as a lexical item.

Particle verbs consist of a verb and an adverbial particle (10). In other groups of the multi-word units discussed here the non-verbal component is a nominal phrase, but formally it can be either the object of the verb as in (11) or some other argument as in (12): (10) Ta loeb raamatud u  X le .
 (11) Ta saab luuletusest ha  X  sti aru (12) Talle ja  X a  X vad luuletused ha  X  sti meelde
As described in Sect. 3 , word order in Estonian is free and is dependent mainly define MWEs as  X  X diosyncratic interpretations that cross word boundaries (or spaces) X . Estonian verbal multi-word expressions do not only cross spaces, but are their type, can have several intervening words between their components (10 X 12). The order of the components of a multi-word expression may vary e.g. (10 X 12) vs. (13 X 14): (13) Kas sa oled raamatud u  X le lugenud ? (14) Sellest ta aru ei saa .
 (15) Ta tahab luuletused ha  X  sti meelde ja  X tta .
In Estonian, the verb of the verbal multi-word expression inflects freely, and the expression. These constraints affect lexical variation, modification and case or variability of Estonian verbal idioms (4.1), support verb constructions (4.2) and particle verbs (4.3). 4.1 Idioms Unlike in English, there are no special restrictions in Estonian on the morpho-logical or syntactic behaviour of verbs that are parts of idioms. A verbal idiom combines freely with all the morphological categories relevant for the verb, including person, number, tense, mood, non-finite forms and the (impersonal) passive. As described in Sect. 3 , the main function of the Estonian impersonal passive seems to be backgrounding of the subject, rather than foregrounding of the object. Thus the nominal component of the idiomatic expression, formally or syntactically the object of the verb, retains its object status even though the verb is impersonalised. This could be the reason why Estonian verbal idioms, including opaque idioms, allow passivisation/impersonalisation. The general restriction X  only clauses with a human subject can be impersonalised/passivised X  X pplies to idioms as well.

The behaviour of the nominal component is more complicated. The nominal component of a prototypical opaque idiom (e.g. Engl. kick the bucket ) takes no modifiers, does not alternate in number and, though formally in the object position, does not follow the rules of object case alternation. But, as could be predicted on the basis of relevant research in English (Nunberg et al. 1994 ; Riehemann 2001 ), a closer examination of the idiomatic expressions in a text corpus reveals considerable variability among the nominal components of verbal idioms.

The syntactic flexibility of an idiomatic expression, i.e. its internal modification, quantification, topicalisation, ellipsis and anaphora, has been an argument in favour of the possible compositionality of some idioms, meaning that not all idioms should be treated as semantically non-compositional units. Many of them, however, (although metaphorically) to the meaning of the expression as a whole (Nunberg et al. 1994 ).

Abeille X  X  ( 1995 ) investigations into French idioms, however, allow her to argue that semantic analyzability alone cannot account for syntactic flexibility, as there are also many semantically non-compositional French idioms that are syntactically flexible. Riehemann X  X  ( 2001 ) data suggest that the relation between semantic compositionality and syntactic flexibility is a matter of degree and only 3% of the semantically non-compositional idioms show variability in the text corpus, but for the semantically decomposable idioms this is as high as 25%.

In the next four subsections we shall give a detailed overview of some subclasses of this variability. We start from phenomena that have also been extensively described for English idioms, i.e. lexical variation, modification and number alternation of the nominal component. The last subsection will address a phenomenon that does not occur in English: the case alternation of the nominal component which formally occupies the position of the object. 4.1.1 Lexical variation in idioms Some idioms belonging to so-called  X  X diom families X  are known to exhibit lexical variation in one of their components without any substantial change in meaning, e.g. set/lay eyes on (Nunberg et al. 1994 : 504; Riehemann 2001 : 35).

As an example of lexical variation in Estonian idioms, we present a family of idioms, where the intransitive items mean  X  X o go astray X  and the transitive members  X  X o lead astray X : eksiteele minema, eksiteele sattuma halvale teele minema, halvale teele sattuma, halvale teele eksima kurjale teele eksima, kurjale teele minema, kurjale teele sattuma laiale teele eksima, laiale teele minema, laiale teele sattuma libedale teele astuma, libedale teele eksima, libedale teele sattuma valele teele minema, valele teele sattuma eksiteele saatma, eksiteele viima halvale teele eksitama, halvale teele saatma, halvale teele viima kurjale teele eksitama, kurjale teele saatma laiale teele eksitama, laiale teele meelitama, laiale teele saatma libedale teele eksitama, libedale teele viima
The intransitive variant meaning  X  X o go astray X  is formed by combining the noun phrases or compound nouns eksiteele (erroneous-road-ALL ), halvale teele (bad-ALL road-ALL ), kurjale teele (evil-ALL road-ALL ), laiale teele (broad-ALL way-ALL ), libedale teele (slippery-ALL way-ALL ), valele teele (wrong-ALL way-ALL ) with the verbs like minema  X  X o go X , eksima  X  X o err X , sattuma  X  X o get into X .

The transitive variant meaning  X  X o lead astray X  is formed by combining the same noun phrases or compound nouns with transitive verbs like eksitama  X  X o mislead X  meelitama  X  X o coax X , saatma  X  X o send X , viima  X  X o bring, to take X . The idiomatic expressions listed here are formed by combining a group of noun phrases, all of which have the same head, the noun tee  X  X ay, road X  with two sets of verbs X  X ne for the intransitive expressions and the other for the transitive ones. The modifying adjectives are synonymous when part of these expressions, but otherwise not. In both sets of verbs there is one verb with very general meaning X  minema  X  X o go X  and viima  X  X o bring, to take X , and some verbs with more specific meanings.

Analyzing German idioms, Stantcheva ( 2004 ) tags the possible components of an idiomatic expression as idiomatic nucleus, obligatory components and facultative components. The idiomatic nucleus is the smallest unit carrying idiomatic meaning, and thus in this idiom family the unvarying nucleus consists only of the noun tee  X  X oad, way X ; all the other components can be described as sets of synonyms in this 4.1.3 Number alternation in idioms In our corpus, the nominal component of opaque idioms in the corpus always occurred in the same number (singular or plural) as its canonical form. In addition, the nominal components of transparent idioms showed little variation in number, with only 3% in the corpus occurring in the non-canonical number, where predominantly the plural form replaced the canonical singular as exemplified in (19): (19) Poliitika lo  X  i mitmeid lo  X  hesid nende ja naabrite vahele .

For a number of expressions it cannot be easily decided whether the singular or plural form of the nominal component is the canonical form, as the nominal component of an idiomatic expression used as a predicate can take the same number as the subject of the clause, e.g. (20) vs. (21): (20) Tema murrab pead .
 (21) Nemad murravad pa  X id .
 4.1.4 Case alternation in idioms The nominal component of an idiomatic verb phrase is formally or syntactically either the object of the verb or some other argument. In Estonian the syntactic object is coded using three alternative case forms X  X ominative, genitive or partitive. The case form of the object depends on the type of the clause and the type of the activity, as described in Sect. 3 .

In idioms the nominal component is the object of the verb only in terms of form surprising if such objects did not undergo the case alternations characteristic of the object and would be frozen in the partitive as the unmarked case of the object. This was true for the opaque idioms, but for transparent idioms this was not the case: our corpus data show that their nominal components can alternate between the cases the object can take. In fact, ca 25% of their nominal components in the object position were in the genitive, i.e. the case of the total object. Now the question arises as to whether this case alternation is totally idiosyncratic i.e. an unpredictable feature of some idioms as exceptional lexical items, or whether we can detect any features that are characteristic of the idioms undergoing case variation.

Evidence from our corpus permits us to identify a number of features common to many idioms with their nominal components as objects in the genitive or nominative case (i.e. allowing case alternation while the unmarked case form of the characterised by either of the following two features: the overt expression of perfectivity or resultativity, and a fixed modifier of the nominal component as part of the idiom.

For overt expression of resultativity/perfectivity the so-called perfective adverbs typical. The resulting resultative idioms typically consist of three components: a verb, a noun in an object case and a perfective adverbial: (22) So  X  ber ra  X a  X kis talle augu pa  X he (23) Ta sai jalad alla
If the activity is imperfective, the nominal component of such idioms is in the partitive case, thereby complying with the general rules of object case alternation: (24) Ma ra  X a  X kisin talle kogu tee auku pa  X he
In the previous examples (22, 23), the transparent idiom with the nominal component in the form of the total object is used to describe telic perfective action. Nevertheless, some idioms, which follow the resultative pattern and allow case alternation of the nominal component, in fact express an atelic action and thus follow formal rules rather than semantic ones, e.g.: (25) Ta hoidis ko  X  rvad lahti
The second group of idioms with their nominal components in the case of total object comprises the expressions with a modified nominal component. The fixed modifier is part of the idiom, e.g.: (26) Nad leidsid u  X hise keele (27) U  X  lemus andis muutustele rohelise tule
However, these two tendencies do not explain all the instances in the corpus where the nominal component of a transparent idiom is in the form of a total object. Many of them are idiosyncratic, e.g. in the next example the nominal component of the transparent idiom na  X  gu tegema  X  X o pretend, lit face-PART make X  is in the genitive, although the expression does not belong to either of the two groups described above: (28) Ta tegi na  X o nagu ei ma  X  rkaks midagi
The transparent idioms, therefore, do not represent a homogeneous group with respect to the case alternation of the nominal component. While a number of them behave like regular verb-object combinations, others show irregular variation, and the nominal components of many of them are frozen in the partitive case.

Although it has been assumed that semantically compositional idioms exhibit more flexibility in their syntax, the instances of object case alternation in Estonian idioms do not entirely agree with this assumption. For example, the idiomatic expressions otsi andma (lit.  X  X nd-PL . PART give X ), koibi sirgu ajama (lit.  X  X tump-.

PART straight drive X ) and vedru va  X  lja viskama (lit. spring-PART out throw) all mean  X  X o die X , have a one-place predicate, and are thus semantically non-compositional expressions. However, all these expressions allow object case variation.  X  X o die X  denotes perfective activity, and perhaps the need for expressing the perfective aspect and/or the rule that the object in the perfective clause has to be the total one, i.e. in nominative or genitive case, overrides other possible constraints. 4.2 Support verb constructions Support verb constructions consist of a noun denoting an action of some kind and a verb that is semantically empty in this context. In most cases the action nominal is formally or syntactically the object of the support verb as in (29), but it can also be some other argument as in (30). This formal object does not code the semantic object of the action, but codes the action itself. If the nominal component is not the formal object, but is instead some other argument coded by oblique cases, the verb contributes a particular nuance to the meaning or Aktionsart of the construction (cf. Krenn 1998 and Hanks et al. 2006 : 442 for German). (29) Ta teeb to  X o  X d .
 (30) Ta viib asja lo  X  pule .
 Support verb constructions are usually regarded as a special type of collocation. The noun denoting action is always used in its usual meaning in a support verb construction. Contrary to idiomatic expressions, support verb constructions have no restrictions on their syntactic behaviour. However, as their syntactic and semantic structures do not coincide (the noun denoting action is syntactically the object or some other complement of the support verb, but is semantically part of the predicate), the syntactic behaviour of this construction warrants closer examination.
 4.2.1 Modification in support verb constructions Modification of the noun denoting an action occurs extensively in support verb constructions X  X a 40% of the instances of the support verb constructions in our corpus included a modified nominal component. From the semantic point of view, the attributes of the action nominals typically modify the support verb construction as a whole, expressing the manner or mode of the activity (31), or acting as intensifiers (32). The modifier can also refer to the semantic object of the action as (Modifiers are underlined in the examples.): (31) Ta andis ta  X  pseid selgitusi .
 (32) Ta avaldas suurt mo  X  ju Wilhelm II-le (33) Ta tegi o  X  nnetusjuhtumite analu  X u  X si 4.2.2 Number alternation The singular vs. plural usage of the noun denoting an action resembles the singular vs. plural usage of count vs. mass nouns. If the action nominal refers to an atelic activity, it behaves like a mass noun and occurs only in singular, e.g. to  X  o  X  d tegema ,  X  X o work, lit. work-PART do X , abi andma  X  X o help, lit. help-PART give X . If the action nominal refers to a telic accomplishment or achievement, it behaves like a count The plural form of the action nominal can also refer to the repeated, habitual activity: (34) Otsuseid tehti konsensuse po  X  himo  X  ttel
In our corpus, 22% of the nominal components of the support verb constructions were in the plural. However, not all plural forms can be explained by the features discussed above: we suggest that there is a set of support verb constructions, used mostly in bureaucratic style, where the support verb construction has been lexicalised with the plural form of the noun, e.g. pretensioone esitama  X  X aise claims, lit. claim-.

PART apply X , korrektiive tegema  X  X o correct, lit. correction-PL . PART make X , tunnistusi andma  X  X o bear witness, lit. testimony-PL . PART give X , ettekirjutusi tegema  X  X ssue precepts, lit. precept-PL . PART make X . 4.2.3 Case alternation Similarly to idioms, it is only formally that the noun in support verb constructions is the object of the verb; semantically it is part of the predicate. Therefore, one might anticipate the nominal component of the support verb construction to be frozen in the partitive case. However, this is not the case, as about 35% of the nominal components of support verb constructions in our corpus appeared in the genitive or nominative, i.e. in the cases of the total object. If the action nominal is syntactically the object of the support verb, the alternation of the object case is employed to express the aspect of the support verb construction (for the relation of aspect and object cases in Estonian cf. Sect. 3 ). Case alternation does not depend on the verb, but on the type of activity (telic vs. atelic) coded by the action nominal. If this activity is atelic, the object is always in partitive case as in (35). If the activity is telic, then in the case of perfective aspect the object is in genitive or nominative X  X he cases of the total object (36). If the activity is imperfective, the object is in the partitive (37): (35) Isa andis talle o  X  petust , kuidas ...
 (36) Z  X  u  X  rii tegi lo  X  puks otsuse (37) Z  X  u  X  rii alles teeb otsust
Some support verb constructions are regularly employed to emphasise the process work, lit. work-PART do X  and so  X  da pidama  X  X o fight a war, lit. war-PART hold X . However, somewhat similarly to case alternation in the idiomatic expressions, if the nominal component is modified with an appropriate attribute (38), or an extra perfective adverbial is inserted (39), the nominal component can also be in the case of the total object, and the support verb expression as a whole then refers to a perfective event: (38) XjaY pidasid viimase omavahelise so  X  ja 17. sajandil (39) Kus me pidasime eile peo maha! 4.3 Particle verbs Particle verbs are frequent and productive constructions in Estonian. The particle component of the particle verb makes them easy to distinguish from the other multi-word expressions discussed in this article. The particle can express location or direction (40), perfectivity (41), state (42) etc., and an Estonian particle verb, just like an English phrasal verb, can have its own semantics, different from the semantics of the simple verb, and make up its own argument structure: (40) Ta kukkus katuselt alla (41) Ta so  X  iko  X  ik kommid a  X  ra.
 (42) Maja oli kokku kukkunud.

The particles used in particle verbs can also act as pre-or postpositions. Some particles are among the most frequent words in Estonian; most particles are more frequent than the frozen or partially frozen case-forms of nouns participating in verbal idiom formation. This means that the components of a potential particle verb occur in the same clause without belonging together much more often than is the case for idioms. 5 Consequences for the computational treatment of multi-word expressions In Sect. 4 we analysed the variability and syntactic flexibility of opaque and transparent verbal idioms, support verb constructions and particle verbs in Estonian based on the evidence provided by the corpus analysis. In this section we shall draw some conclusions with regard to the computational treatment of these expressions.
We are working towards a database-based annotating tool that would serve as a separate module in conjunction with morphological analysis and prior to syntactic and/or semantic analysis. The tool consists of a database of verbal MWEs and a program that annotates these expressions in texts.

The annotation of these MWEs brings on several problems; some can be more easily dealt with by the program and others are more easily solved by improving the database. For a morphologically rich agglutinative language like Estonian, morphological analysis and disambiguation prior to the detecting of multi-word units in a text is essential.

As explained at the very beginning of Sect. 4 , all verbal MWEs, regardless of their type, can have several intervening words between their components, and the order of the components of a verbal MWE depends on clause type and pragmatic factors. This means that the program has to take the complete clause as the context when inspecting possible component candidates for a MWE and the accurate detection of clause boundaries is essential for successful MWE annotation. We also mentioned in Sect. 4 that the verb of the MWE inflects freely and that MWEs fall into two groups depending on the morphosyntactic variability of their non-verbal component. We can treat opaque idioms and particle verbs much the same in the database X  X he non-verbal component of each always appears in the same form in texts.

The situation is more complicated for the transparent idioms and support verb constructions: the nominal components of these two constructions show considerable variability in the manually annotated corpus. In our system we address this variability by generating all possible case and/or number forms in the database. (This set of word-forms is a subset of all the possible word-forms of these nominal components met outside the multi-word verbal units.) The database includes information about the subclasses of the expressions (i.e. particle verb vs. opaque idiom vs. transparent idiom vs. support verb construction) and information regarding the morphological categories of the nominal component of the expression. For the support verb constructions (described in Sect. 4.2 ) that code their nominal components formally as objects of the support verbs, we decided to generate all possible case forms of the object both in singular and plural.
 As described in Sect. 4.1 , transparent idioms form the most heterogeneous group. Manual annotation of every single transparent idiom in the database based on large-scale corpus analysis would be ideal, but very time-consuming. We have tried simple manual annotation based on introspection, but checking of random expressions in a large corpus revealed surprisingly many mistakes. At present, the solution is to generate all the three case forms of the object if the nominal component of a transparent idiom is formally the object of the verb, but we should not allow number alternation.

As described in Sect. 4.1.1 , some idioms allow lexical variation in one of their components. At present, our system does not deal with this kind of variation, idiom expressions in our database. 6 Conclusion In this article we analyse the behaviour in Estonian, an agglutinative language with free word order, of three types of verbal MWEs: idioms, support verbs constructions and particle verbs. We divided the class of idioms into two subgroups: opaque idioms and transparent idioms.

All Estonian verbal MWEs, regardless of their type, can have several intervening words between their components, and the order of the components may vary. The verb of the verbal MWE inflects freely; the flexibility constraints, if any, apply only to the nominal component of the expression. The non-verbal component of the MWE is a nominal phrase in idioms and support verb constructions. Although it is part of the predicate semantically, it can formally be either the object of the verb or some other argument.

The nominal component of the opaque idioms showed no variability in the corpus material. The picture was clearly different for transparent idioms, as their nominal components showed considerable flexibility: about a quarter of them revealed variation in case and/or had modifiers. Number alternations were less common.
The preliminary evidence from Estonian does not support the assumption that only semantically compositional idioms exhibit flexibility in their morphosyntactic behaviour.

Support verb constructions have no restrictions on their syntactic behaviour. It is worth mentioning that modifiers of the nouns in support verb constructions may denote the semantic object of the activity.

If the nominal component of a transparent idiom or a support verb construction is a syntactic object, it may adhere to the rules of object case alternation, depending on the aspect of the clause and the lexical properties of the nominal component. The idiosyncratic, but some regularity could be attested. The case alternation of support verb constructions is more systematic. So one can conclude that different types of MWEs require different computational treatment.
