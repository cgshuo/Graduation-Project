 I propose to look at information retrieval applications from the perspective of the data stack infrastructure that is needed in research prototypes a nd production systems.
 Data science, b ig data, small data , infrastructure, applications. Every day millions of users rely on web search engines and social networks t o search for information and learn about current events. While the us er inte rface of those services is intuitive and easy to use, the amount of data being collected, mined, analyzed, and indexed for presenting relevant information is quite large. At the same time, large data sets are used internally by service providers for measuring user satisfaction and testing improvements with large scale experimentation. In this talk, I will present the notion of the data stack , an alternative way of looking at information retrieval applications .
 The database community is focused on da ta and systems for storing, organizing, and querying all sorts of data [1] . The information retrieval community promotes research and development in the areas of search and information access and has, traditionally, been focused on metrics and modeling and not so much on data analysis and exploration as a core principle [2] . Given the massive adoption of different types of search services, information retrieval is becoming a more data -driven and data -intensive area. Besides the large scale of the Web and so cial networks that require systems to crawl and ingest such data, users also leave enormous amounts of new data in the form of search query logs, clicks, and generated content that are used to improve relevance and for predictive modeling .
 Almost a decade ago, Jim Gray proposed to start thinking in terms data -intensive research and discovery, known as the F ourth P aradigm , a new way of doing science that uses data as one of the main pillar s [3] . The goal is for scientists to turn to discovery through data a nalysis making use of massive data sets. With the data science role now taking a central part in t he software industry and the on -going cross -pollination with other disciplines, data is currently perceived as the new oil.
