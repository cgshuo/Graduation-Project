 We propose an interdisciplinary workshop to explore key design principles of collaborative learning in the workplace. The workshop X  X  theme is, simply  X  X SCL at the workplace X . Our first workshop at ACM Group 2010, and the resulting book, raise an important set of issues and potentials for research, but does not solve the thorny and controversia l issues. This workshop will be focused on for making progress on the identified issues. The ACM Group conference remains an ideal venue for a workshop on this topic because the North American and European communities who participate in Group include leading members of the international CSCL and CSCW communities. The proposed workshop will be a full da y. It will open with a situating presentation by the organizers and, participant questions and proposed solutions aimed at the issues we have raised and begun to recognize, and focus working groups on the resolution of those issues in work to follow the conference. To participate in the workshop, discussants will be asked for a position paper of up to 2 pages in standard ACM format. Our edited book will be made available to participants in advance, and selected authors who will be present will provide overviews of their work and perspective in an interleaved way with the more action oriented working sessions.

Because of its great success and the effects on the CSCL and CSCW community (G oggins, Jahnke, Wulf, 2012), we propose a follow-up workshop focused on exploring key design principles of computer supporte d collaborative learning in work community of interests, to bring together researchers with a natural affinity toward the ACM GROUP conference to share examples of CSCL@Work and subse quently fill a significant gap in the literature, through a journal special issue. The motivation of the topic can be best described with words by John Seely Brown: To build a bridge between learning what is known and learning that creates new knowledge is of crucial importance for both the computer supported collaborative learning community and the computer supported collaborative work community (dePaula &amp; Fischer, 2005). Such a  X  X ulture of participation X  (Fischer 2011) is also needed for researchers, consultants and designers of CSCL@Work to foster learning@work concepts. Learning at the workplace often focuses on learning such as the primary activity. But CSCL@Work also considers the fact that learning means to provide empl oyees with timely access to information for conducting everyday work while respecting business goals; learning in these cases is a secondary activity and work is the primary activity (M X rch &amp; Skaanes, 2010). We distinguish CSCL@Work from prior research of CSCL, CSCW and knowledge management . Prior work is focused on computer supported collaborative learning, much of it investigating the application of computer support for learning in the context of traditional educational institutions, like public Exciting new theories of how knowledge is constructed by groups (Stahl, 2006), how teachers contribute to collaborative learning and the application of socio-t echnical scripts is emerging from 2006, Turner et al. 2006]. A number of existing works pr ovide empirical research on collaborative work practices [D avenport, 2005; Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991], the sharing of information at work [Brown &amp; Duguid, 2000], and the development of communities of practice in workplace settings [Wenger, 1998]. Others examine the munificent variation of in formation and communication technology use in the work pla ce, including studies of informal social networks, form al information distribution and other socio-technical combinations found in work settings [Hinds &amp; Weisband, 2003]. Wenger, 1991; Davenport, 2005), th e sharing of information at work (Brown &amp; Duguid, 2000), and the development of communities of practice in workplace settings (Wenger, 1998) show how knowledge can be shared in communities of practice when that knowledge is known inside of an organizational context. But problems related to the distribution of knowledge holders and their knowledge remains unsolved (dePaula &amp; Fischer, 2005). Prior, well-known findings like these rely on the premise that knowledge within an organization X  X  walls can be actively diffused across the orga nization (Gibson &amp; Cohen, 2003); then proceed to describe various models explaining how that occurs. Those knowledge manageme nt approaches are premised on a certain degree of environmental stability inside a company . The notion, that you can  X  X tore knowledge X , implies it is likely to be useful for some period of time sufficient to justify the effort of capturing it. The workshop aims to fill a void between existing discourse in CSCW, knowledge management and CSCL, and will open with a short presentation by the organizers, characterizing the emerging application of collaborative learning theories and practices to workplace learning. CSCL and CSCW research each make distinct and important contributions to the construction of collaborative workplace learning, first identified by Billet (2002). From a first workshop in 2010 at ACM Group, we could collect first design principles, such as Guiding questions for the workshop are: There are significant implications for this approach for both researchers and practitioners. Researchers will need to consider how CSCL@Work is designed for and studied. Practitioners will be compel led to rethink how workplace training is conducted, and how more collaborative learning strategies could contribute to higher performance, faster transfer of technology from research and development to product and changes to other si gnificant output measures. Our workshop aims to continue want we began in 2010, the process of identifying and describing the different manifestations of collaborative learning at work. A description of the three patterns of CSCL at work that we have observed is warranted here. First, there is the use of collaborative learning to bring new employees into existing teams. This is distinct from the legitimate peri pheral participation observed by communities of practice (Wenger, 1998). In the case of CSCL at work, collaborative learning to bring new employees into a team includes tutoring, layered introduc tion to information resources of the team, progressive granting of access rights to the tools the team member. There is a mutual recognition on the part of the new person on the team that this training is a component of doing complex work that spans multiple socio-technical systems. Software developers, engineers and scientists are among those who progress through this type of CSCL at work. Second, we have noticed a pattern of CSCL at work used to accelerate technology transfer from research universities to industrial practice. Organizer Jahnke ha s observed these phenomena with teams in the field of material science on her current project, Organizer Goggins has observed these phenomena in computer science and engineering technology transfer. Third, CSCL at Engineering, research and technology service firms are especially likely to utilize computer-media ted training that goes beyond textbooks, recorded PowerPoint lect ures and prepared material. In contrast with traditional workplace learning, focused on task oriented, practice oriented or regulatory compliance objectives, CSCL at work recognizes that the nature of innovation is interwoven to the seam that binds work and learning together. In some respects, this is the tradition of university education: The integration of learning and research. In proposing this workshop, prevalence should be recogn ized through research. The line between collaborative work as research and collaborative learning is blurred. Our experien ce is that this is especially common when researchers, engineers or designers contribute to CSCL efforts aimed at those who apply their inventions. Global economic upheaval framed by socially disconnected obfuscation, volatile commodity prices, and an increasing need for time of unique peril and opportunity that will draw upon diverse research communities for solutions. In this context, learning is no longer an activity that is separate from work. Learning at work is also about more than acquiring new information to perform a task, but about developing new knowledge to help a firm, an organization or a government improve its services in socially measurable as well as economically measurable ways. Three goals motivate the proposal for this workshop: 1) To identify and discuss key design principles (social, 2) To identify theoretical and methodological commonalities 3) To continue with cultivating a community who share an The workshop will commence with a brief introduction by the organizers. The remainder of the agenda follows a trajectory of idea generation and integration protocols; input by different experts (I) and working sessions (WS) :
