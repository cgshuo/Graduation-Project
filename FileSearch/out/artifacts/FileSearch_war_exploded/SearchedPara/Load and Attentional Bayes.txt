 It was some fifty years after James (1950) X  X  famously poetic d escription of our capacities for atten-tion that more analytically-directed experiments began, b ased originally on dichotic listening Cherry (1953). There are three obvious dichotic tasks: (i) being ab le to interpret fully two separate streams of information coming into the two ears; (ii) the less ambiti ous version of this of being able to in-terpret fully one of the streams, specified top-down, without interference fr om the other one; and (iii) being able to combine information from the two ears appropriately, perhaps into a single per-cept. Various forms, interpretations and conflicts about th ese three tasks have permeated the field of attention ever since (Driver, 2001; Paschler, 1998), drive n by different notions of the computational tasks and constraints at hand.
 The experiments in dichotic listening coincided with the qu ickly burgeoning realization that math-ematical concepts from Shannonian information theory woul d be very helpful for understanding biological information processing. One central concept in information theory is that of a limited ca-pacity channel, and Broadbent (1958) adopted this as a forma l basis for understanding the necessity for, and hence the nature of, selection. Broadbent (1958) X  X  theory critically involves early selection, in that following a first, automatic, parallel stage of low-l evel perceptual processing (itself the sub-ject of important studies of bottom-up influences on selecti on, Zhaoping, 2006), a relevant stream should be selected for subsequent higher-level, semantic, processing, leaving any irrelevant streams in the cold. However, evidence that information in unattend ed streams is actually processed seman-tically ( eg being able to bias the perception of ambiguous words in the at tended stream; Mackay, 1973), led to alternative theories, either late selection (influentially, Deutsch and Deutsch, 1963; Duncan, 1980), in which both streams are fully processed, bu t with the irrelevant stream being pre-vented by a selective process at the last step from entering m emory or awareness, or weaker forms of this, such as the notion that elements from the irrelevant st ream might be attenuated , only sometimes progressing through to higher levels of processing (Treism an, 1960, 1969). Many hypotheses in the field depend on this collection of metaphors, nicely exempli fied by the zoom-lens theory of Erik-sen and St. James (1986) (based on influential experiments on distractor processing such as Eriksen and Eriksen, 1974), which suggests that the smaller the atte ntional focus, the more intense it can somehow be, given that the limited capacity is  X  X pread X  over a smaller area.
 However, of course, late selection makes little sense from a limited capacity viewpoint; and short of a theory of what controls the degree of attenuation of irre levant stimuli, Treisman (1960) X  X  idea is hard to falsify. Here, we consider the seminal sharp opera tionalization of Lavie and Tsal (1994); Lavie (2005), who suggested that attenuation is a function o f load , such that in easy tasks, irrelevant data is always processed, even at the cost of worse performance on the relev ant information, whereas in difficult tasks, no capacity remains, and so distractors a re more effectively removed. To reiterate, the attentional load hypothesis, although an attractive fo rmalization of attenuation, suggests that the brain is unable on easy tasks to exclude information that is known to be irrelevant. It therefore involves an arguably infelicitous combination of sophisti cated attentional shaping (as to what can be attended in high-load situations) with inept control.
 Although the Bayesian revolution in cognitive science has h ad a huge impact over modern views of sensory processing (see, for instance, Rao et al., 2002, and references therein), having the ability to resolve many issues in the field as a whole, there are few recen t attempts to build probabilistic models for selective attention (see Shaw, 1982; Palmer, 1994; Daya n and Zemel, 1999; Navalpakkam and Itti, 2006; Mozer and Baldwin, 2008; Yu and Dayan, 2005; Yu et al., 2008). This is despite the many other computational models of attention (see Itti and K och, 2001; Zhaoping, 2006). Indeed, Whiteley and Sahani (2008) have suggested that this lacuna ar ises from a focus on optimal Bayesian inference in the face of small numbers of objects in the focus of attention, rather than the necessity of using approximate methods in the light of realistic, clut tered, complex scenes.
 Some of the existing probabilistic models are aimed at varia nts of search (Navalpakkam and Itti, 2006; Mozer and Baldwin, 2008); however others, including P almer (1994); Dayan and Zemel (1999), and one of the two models in Yu et al. (2008), are more s imilar to the account here. They acknowledge that there is a critical limited resource comin g from the existence of neurons with large receptive fields into which experimenters slot multiple sen sory objects, some relevant, some irrele-vant. Probabilistically-correct inference should then im plement selection, when data that is known to be irrelevant is excluded to the advantage of the relevant information ( eg Dayan and Zemel, 1999; Palmer, 1994). However, in other circumstances, it will be a ppropriate to take advantage of the information about the target that is available in the neuron s with large fields, even if this means allowing some influence on the final decisions from distracto rs.
 Here, we build a Bayesian-inspired account of key data used t o argue for the attentional load hypoth-esis (based on an extension of Yu et al. (2008) X  X  model of Erik sen and Eriksen (1974)). Section 2 describes the key data; section 3 the model and results; and s ection 4 discusses the implications. Figure 1 shows the central experiment and results from Lavie and de Fockert (2003) that we set out to capture. Subjects had to report the identity of a target le tter that was either an  X  X  X  or an  X  X  X  (here, the former) presented in one of eight locations arranged in a circle around the fixation point. The reaction times and accuracies of their selections were meas ured. There was also a distractor letter in the further periphery (the larger  X  X  X ) which was either compatible ( ie the same as the target), incompatible (as here, the opposite of the target), or, in so-called neutral trials, a different letter altogether.
 Figure 1A-C show the three key conditions. Figure 1A is a high -load condition, in that there are irrelevant non-targets in the remaining 7 positions around the circle. Figure 1B is a low-load con-dition, since there is no non-target. Figure 1C is a critical control, called the degraded low-load condition, and was actually the main topic of Lavie and de Foc kert (2003). In this, the difficulty of the sensory processing was increased (by making the target s maller and dimmer) without changing the attentional ( ie selectional) load.
 Figure 1D shows the mean reaction times (RTs) for these condi tions for the three sorts of distractor (RTs suffice here, since there was no speed accuracy tradeoff at work in the different conditions; data not shown). There are three key results: Figure 1: The attentional load task, from Lavie and de Focker t (2003). Subjects had to judge whether a target letter in the central circle around fixation was  X  X  X  o r  X  X  X  in the face of a compatible, incom-patible (shown) or neutral distractor. A) high-load condit ion with non-target letters occupying the other positions in the circle. B) low-load condition with no non-target letters. C) degraded low-load condition with no non-targets but a smaller (not shown) and d arker target. D) reaction times (RTs) for the conditions, averaging only over correct choices. The data in figure 1 pose the question for normative modeling a s to why the distractor would corrupt processing of the target in the easy, low-load, case, but not the difficult, high-load case. No normative account could simply assume that extra data  X  X eak X  through i n the low-load condition (which is the attentional load hypothesis) if the subjects have the abili ty to fashion attention far more finely in other cases, such as that of high load.
 We argue that these results stem from the simple observation that the visual system has available receptive fields with a range of sizes, including smaller, sp atially precise ones, which can be nicely confined to the target; and larger, spatially extended ones, which may include both target and dis-tractor. In this case, normative processing will combine in formation from all the receptive fields, with Bayesian inference and marginalization exactly elimi nating any substantial impact from those that are useless or confusing. In the high load case, the prox imal non-target stimuli have the effect of adding so much extra noise to the units with large receptive fi elds compared with their signal about the target, that only the smallest receptive fields will be su bstantially useful. This implies that the distractor will exert little influence. In the low load case, large receptive fields that also include the distractor will be usefully informative about the target, a nd so the distractor will exert an influence. Note that this happens automatically through inference  X  indeed to make this point starkly, there is Table 1: Our version of the task. This table shows 6 out of the 18 conditions. Each display consists of four stimulus positions labelled n for the n on-targets; t for the t arget (shown in the table, though not the display, as being boxed); and d for the d istractor, which is relatively far from the t arget. The t arget takes the values  X  c , where c acts like a contrast; subjects have to report its sign. The d istractor can be 0 (neutral) or  X  1 ; and is compatible if it has the same sign as the t arget (and conversely, incompatible). Load is increased by having non -zero n on-targets which are spatially balanced , with mean 0 , so providing no net information about the sign of the t arget, but only noise. The 18 conditions come from using c =  X  1 and c =  X  0 . 3 , with the degraded condition ( | c | = 0 . 3 ) only being run for the case of low load, as in figure 1D.
 Lavie and de Fockert (2003) X  X  experiment is rather complica ted. Table 1 shows our simplification of it, to a form which is slightly closer to a version of an Erik sen task (Eriksen and Eriksen, 1974) with two optional flankers in known positions on either size o f the target (the n on-targets) and a farther-flung d istractor (the input layer of figure 2A cartoons the spatial a rrangement). The t arget takes the value  X  c ; subjects have to report its sign. The d istractor can be neutral ( 0 ) or have the same sign as (compatible) or a different sign from (incompatible ) the t arget. In the low load condition, the n on-target units are 0 ; in the high load, one is +1 ; the other is  X  1 , making them balanced, but confusing, because they lead to excess noise.
 The generative model Table 1 indicates the values determining the various condit ions from the perspective of the experi-menter. We assume that the subject performs inference about the sign of the t arget based on noisy observations created by a generative model. In the generati ve model, the values in table 1 amount to hidden structure, which, as in Yu et al. (2008), is mapped and mixed t hrough various receptive fields to provide the noisy input to a Bayesian recognition model. T he job of the recognition model is to calculate the posterior probability of the various hidden s ettings given data, and, by marginalizing (summing) out all the hidden settings apart from the state of the t arget, report on its sign. Figure 2A shows the generative model, indicating the recept ive fields (RFs) associated with this mixing. We consider 8 topographically-mapped units, 4 with small RFs covering only a single input (the generative weights are just the identity map); and 4 with large RFs (in which the inputs are mixed together more holistically). Since the d istractor is relatively far from the t arget and n on-target stimuli, the weights associated with its hidden values are l ower for the three large RFs mapped to the t arget and n on-target hidden units; the t arget and n on-target hidden units have smaller weights to the generated input associated with the d istractor. For simplicity, we treat the d istractor as equidistant from the t arget and n on-target input, partially modeling the fact that it can be i n different locations. We assume a crude form of signal-dependent noise; it is this t hat makes the n on-target stimuli so devastating.
 Figure 2B shows the means and standard deviations arising fr om the generative model for the 8 units (one per column) for the six conditions in table 1 (rows from top to bottom  X  low load: neutral, incompatible, compatible; then high load: neutral, incomp atible, compatible). For this figure, c = +1 . The means associated with the small and large RF t arget units show the lack of bias from the n on-targets in the high-load condition; and for the large RF c ase, the bias associated with the distractor.
 The standard deviations play the most critical role in the mo del, defining what it means for the n on-target stimuli, when present, to make inference difficult. T hey therefore constitute a key modeling assumption. In the high load case, the units with the large RF s are assumed to have very high stan-dard deviations, coming from a crude form of signal-depende nt noise. This captures the relatively uselessness of these large RFs in the high load condition. Ho wever, and importantly, their mean values are unaffected by the n on-target stimuli, since the n on-targets are balanced between positive and negative values, preferring neither sign of target.
 Figure 2: The generative model. A) In the model, the four inpu t units, representing n on-targets, the t arget and the d istractor, are assumed to generate 8 input units which fall into two groups, with small and large receptive fields (RFs). The Hinton diagrams o f the weights indicate how the RFs are represented (all weights are positive; the maximum value is 0.3). B) These plots show the means and standard deviations in the generative model associated with the 8 input units for the low and high load cases shown in table 1 (in raster scan order). The me ans for the large RFs (based on the weights in A) are unaffected by the load; the standard deviat ions for the units with large receptive fields are much higher in the high load condition. Standard de viations are affected by a coarse form of signal-dependent noise.
 In all cases, a new sample from the generative model is provid ed at each time step; the noise cor-rupting each of the observed units is assumed to be Gaussian, and independent across units and over time.
 The recognition model We build a recognition model based on this generative model. The recognition model is quite similar to a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT; Wald, 1947), e xcept that, as in Yu and Dayan (2005); Yu et al. (2008), it is necessary to perform inference over all t he possible values of the hidden variables the t arget itself. We accumulate evidence until a threshold of 0 . 9 is reached on the probability that the target is either positive or negative (reporting whiche ver one is more likely). However, to take account of the possibility of erroneous, early, responses, there is also a probability of 0 . 01 per step of stopping the accumulation and reporting whichever sign of t arget has a higher probability (guessing randomly if this probability is 0 . 5 ). This factor played a critical role in Yu et al. (2008) in gen erating early responses.
 Results Figure 3 shows the results of inference based on the model. Fo r each of the conditions, figure 3A shows the reaction times in the form of the mean number of step s to a choice. Here, as in the data in Lavie and de Fockert (2003), the RTs are averaged only over cases in which the model got the answer correct. However, figure 3B shows the percentage corr ect answers in each condition; the errors are relatively rare, and so the RTs plots look identic al. The datapoints are averages over more than 35 , 000 samples (depending on the actual error rates) and so the erro rbars are too small to see. Comparing figure 3A with the data in figure 1D, it is apparent th at the main trends in the data are closely captured. This general pattern of results is rob ust to many different parameter values; though it is possible (by reducing c ) to make inference take very much longer still in the degrade d low load condition whilst maintaining and boosting the effe ct of high load. The error probabilities in figure 3B indicate that the pattern of RTs is not accounted f or by a tradeoff between speed and accuracy.
 The three characteristics of these data described above are explained in the model as: Figure 3: Results. A) Mean RTs (steps of inference) for corre ct choices in each of the 9 cases (since the t arget is equally often positive and negative, we averaged ov er these cases. Here, the threshold on the (marginalized) probability was 0 . 9 , and there was a probability of 0 . 01 per step that inference would terminate early with whichever response was more prob able. B) Error probabilities for the same conditions showing the lack of a speed-accuracy trade-off. All points are averages over more than 35000 points, and so errorbars would be too small to see. In this paper, we have shown how to account for key results use d to argue for an attentional load hy-pothesis. Our model involves simple Bayesian inference bas ed on a generative process recognizing the existence of small and large receptive fields. The attent ional load hypothesis suggests that when little attention is required to solve the set task, inputs as sociated with d istractor stimuli leak through with little attenuation, and so cause disruption; when the t ask is difficult, attention is totally occu-pied with the set task, leaving nothing left over. By contras t, we have suggested that an inferential model taking advantage of all the information in the input wi ll show exactly the same characteristic, with the key issue being whether the units with large RFs, whi ch include the d istractor, are rendered useless by the n on-target stimuli that make for the high load in the first plac e. The advantage of this version of an attenuation theory (Treisman, 1960, 1969) is t hat it obviates the requirement to appeal to an inexplicable inefficiency, over and above the existenc e of units with large RFs, and indeed relates this set of selective attentional tasks to the wide r ange of other accounts of probabilistically-correct sensory inference.
 One key characteristic of this model (shared with, among oth ers, Yu et al., 2008) is that the form of selection it considers is an output of inference rather than an input into it. That is, the model does not employ an explicit attentional mechanism in inference w hich has the capacity to downplay some input units over others. The model does know the location of t he target, and focuses all its resources on it; but there is no further way of boosting or suppressing s ome RFs compared with others. Most of the substantial results on the neuroscience of selective attention ( eg Moran and Desimone, 1985; Desimone and Duncan, 1995; Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004) stu dy the focusing process, rather than the post-focus information integration that we have looked at; the forms of attention at play in the load-related tasks we have discussed are somewhat orthogon al. It would be interesting to design neurophysiological experiments to probe the form of online selection at work in the attentional load tasks.
 The difference between the present model and the spatial ver sion of Yu et al. (2008) is that the model here includes RFs of different sizes, whereas in that model, the d istractors were always close to the target. Further, the two neutral conditions here (no d istractor, and low load) were not modeled in the earlier study. Yu et al. (2008) suggested that the anterior c ingulate might monitor conflict between the cases of compatible and incompatible d istractors as part of an approximate inference strategy. That seems most unlikely here, since the conflict would have t o be between the multidimensional collection of hidden nuisance variables (notably the cross product between the states of the n on-targets and the state of the d istractor), which seems implausibly complicated.
 The assumptions of large RFs and their high standard deviati ons in the high load condition are cer-tainly rather simplistic. However, (a) RFs in inferotempor al cortex are indeed very large, allowing for the possibility of d istractor interference in the low load condition; and (b) ev en under the atten-tional load hypothesis, the only reason that an unattenuate d d istractor stimulus would interfere with target processing is that there is something in common about them, since it is known that there is more to the effects of d istractors than just competition at the stage of the actual r esponses (Driver, 2001). Further, the assumption that the inputs with large RF s have high standard deviations in the high load condition is a most straightforward way to capture the essential effect of the n on-target stimuli in disrupting target processing in a way that forces a more stringent attentional effect associ-ated with the use of the small RFs.
 The attentional load theory has been applied to many tasks (i ncluding the regular Eriksen task, Eriksen and Eriksen, 1974) as well as the one here. However, i t would be good to extend the current model to match the experimental circumstances in Lavie and d e Fockert (2003) more faithfully. Perhaps the most significant lacuna is that, as in the Eriksen task, we assumed that the subjects knew the location of the target in the stimulus array, whereas in t he real experiment, this had to be inferred from the letters in the circle of targets close to fixation (fig ure 1A). Modeling this would effectively require a more complex collection of letter-based RFs, toge ther with a confusion matrix associated with the perceptual similarities of letters. This induces a search problem, more like the one studied by Mozer and Baldwin (2008), except, again, multiple sizes o f RFs would play a critical role. It would also be worth extending the current model to the much wi der range of other tasks used to explore the effects of attentional load (such as Forster and Lavie, 2008).
 In conclusion, we have suggested a particular rationale for an attenuation theory of attention, which puts together the three tasks suggested at the outset for dic hotic listening. Inputs should automati-cally be attenuated to the extent that they do not bear on (or, worse, are confusing with respect to) a task. The key resource limitation is the restricted number , and therefore, the necessarily broad tuning of RFs; the normative response to his makes attenuati on and combination kissing cousins.
