Teaching Web Search Skills: Techniques and Strategies of Top Trainers, Greg R. Notess. Information Today, Inc. (2006). $29.50, ISBN: 1-57387-267-9
The field of information search and retrieval has changed considerably with the growth of the World Wide Web. No long-er strictly in the domain of the library sciences, the ability to teach effective techniques and procedures for finding informa-tion on the Web has, as stated by Notess,  X  X  X rought together the general public, librarians, computer scientists and pedagogues X . While the technology of the Web and the means for accessing information may change, there are  X  X  X asic prin-ciples X  generally accepted as effective regardless of medium.

This book seeks to communicate to those teaching Web search techniques a set of skills effective in teaching in this highly dynamic subject area. It provides an excellent overview of educational strategy in general as well as a highly useful reference volume covering everything from basic terminology to search examples useful in illustrating key points as well as class exer-cises useful to instructors in developing their own set of Web training resources.

The author X  X  style is very informal and exceptionally readable and is highly suitable for both the topic being covered and the target audience of information professionals likely to find themselves teaching Web search skills. The flow of the book followed this same pattern, beginning with a clearly articulated  X  X  X oadmap X  of subjects to be presented in the table of con-tents and an explanation in the preface discussing the difficulty associated with teaching Web search skills. The 13 chapters of the book each take on a specific area beginning with an introduction of what Web search is and how it has changed with the advent of the Web and then transitioning to the instructor X  X  role in teaching effective search techniques, presenting an excellent segue into the chapters that cover the art of teaching these skills.

The author was quick to point out that one of the greatest challenges in teaching Web search skills that is typically more pronounced than in teaching other subjects is the wide disparity in the audiences experience, characterizing most classes as having three categories of learner which he characterized as  X  X  X ovices, know it alls and experts X . In sum, the author stated  X  X  X he better we understand our users, the more we can empower them X  which is good advice for any instructor.
In addition to knowing the target audience, a substantial discussion of environmental factors was covered. Again, the author did an exceptional job pointing out the unique environmental characteristics associated with teaching Web search, discussing the impacts of hardware and software compatibility issues, security concerns associated with firewalls at certain sites, and most importantly the reliability and quality of connectivity to the Internet. Notess points out the need for backup methods for instructing should the connection fail, offering handouts and pre-recorded sessions as just a few alternatives should connectivity be lost during a training session. An exceptional breakdown of the pros and cons associated with on-line tutorials as a method of training was also covered, though the review of the authors own on-line tutorial seemed a bit inap-propriate in what was an otherwise unbiased and comprehensive analysis.

The next area the author examined was the development of a teaching plan capable of delivering effective search skills to a given audience. He identified three primary areas, including  X  X  X ession focus, session length, and session goal X . Each of these areas was described in considerable detail and effectively reached back to prior concepts of audience analysis, environmen-tal considerations, and delivery method in a very engaging and understandable manner. Another very effective means used by the author to communicate teaching techniques was his introduction of the opinions, viewpoints, and experiences of a variety of the top instructors in the field conducting Web search instruction. The addition of these  X  X  X ar stories X  from top instructors corroborated the difficulty that even seasoned instructors face in teaching Web search as well as providing con-text for how the techniques might be applied in a classroom setting.

The section on terminology was both relevant in terms of the currency and completeness of the terms defined and pro-vided an excellent reference for basic terms that need to be taught to ensure students have a basic level of information lit-eracy necessary to benefit from Web search training. The section on advanced search features highlighted another aspect of this book that makes it a very good addition to the reference library of anyone involved with Web search, whether one is teaching to a group or conducting a search of their own. The comprehensiveness of the techniques and the step-by-step breakdown of how to teach these search techniques make the book an indispensable resource for even the most seasoned searcher. As the author pointed out, many of these techniques  X  X  X re something I use only once or twice a year X  so while useful, many are not something a typical searcher uses often making the utility of this reference quite obvious given the individual tendency to  X  X  X ose what we don X  X  use X .

The emphasis on the four stages of research cited by Rita Vine as  X  X  X athering information, selecting from information gathered, processing the information into knowledge, and communicating the knowledge X  pointed out the double edged sword that the Web and the vast store of information available via this medium represents. She emphasizes this stating that  X  X  X he problem with the Web is that because we do not have to physically go and get something, we become disorganized in our searching. The Web makes results retrieval so easy that we become sloppy researchers X . The changing nature of the Web was also effectively illustrated through a discussion of the differing search techniques available for different media such as news, photos music, and videos and how many of the  X  X  X pecialized X  search tools once providing coverage in a particular med-ium have been edged out of the market as the big three search engines have incorporated these areas into their interfaces.
One minor criticism of this section, however, was the comment that  X  X  X eaching this changing nature of Web and Web technology was good for building  X  X  X ore traffic for your classes X  which detracted a bit from the largely instructional focus the book had maintained allowing it to turn for a brief moment to the dark side of self-promotion rather than focusing on instruction.
The final breakdown of search engines in alphabetic order was a good approach to analyzing the strengths and weak-nesses of each however there appeared to be a bit of what could be characterized as almost a reverse bias against Google.
Despite declaring it as the  X  X  X redominant X  search engine of the moment, the author was quick to point out that these trends of use have been highly volatile throughout their brief history, almost going out of his way to not let it appear that Google was the preferred search engine of the day. While this historical perspective is valid and worthwhile in terms of further iden-tifying the changeable nature of the Web and Web technologies, a few more concrete reasons such as Google X  X  lack of trun-cation would be a more effective means of documenting its deficiencies. The statement that  X  X  X t lacks many advanced search features X  is extremely vague and it would be far better to cite the specific features he feels are missing rather than referring to a list of deficiencies listed on searchenginesshowdown.com.

Overall however, the book presented in a very effective manner the essential knowledge necessary to develop a teaching plan capable of delivering quality instruction on Web search skills to a variety of audiences. In addition to the topical refer-ences covered in each of the chapters, the book also delivers extensive biographical information and publications of the ex-perts cited throughout the text and a huge volume of sample handouts and training materials that could be modified for use in future teaching plans. The author X  X  use of screenshots and links throughout the book is highly effective at aiding the reader in understanding and providing additional information resources in this exceptionally well written and comprehensive work. Social Software in Libraries: Building Collaboration, Communication and Community Online, Meredith G. Farkas. Information Today, Inc., Medford New Jersey (2007), $39.50, ISBN: 978-1-57387-275-1
The book,  X  X  X ocial Software in Libraries X , introduces various applications of social software in contemporary libraries. It explores the growing phenomenon of social software and how these technologies can be applied in libraries. Farkas, as a distance learning Liberian, tries to present relevant constructs as simple as possible, so that a typical librarian could under-stand some of the cutting-edge technologies. She draws on the concepts of generation X throughout her book, illuminating the particularities of this generation. This sounds crucial since librarians are increasingly facing a generation that views the Internet as an inseparable and critical element of their lives.

In the information era, social software allows people to communicate and to build online communities. It also lets them capitalize on the behavior and knowledge of each other. To this end, Farkas believes that libraries should be aware of the consequences and applications of social software. They need to do so, because their patrons will be likely use some sorts of social software, whether IM, blog, or listen to podcasts. By building on these technologies, they can also disseminate infor-mation and their resources, or improve the internal communication of their libraries.

The first 13 chapters of the book introduce social software, and then elaborate on a wide range of tools and their possible applications in libraries. They encompass technologies ranging from blogs to gaming. The first chapter discusses what the social software is, and then enumerates its main characteristics. The next two chapters center on blog phenomenon and its applications. They posit that static Websites fail to put a human face on the library. On the contrary, a blog can provide this and enable libraries to educate their patrons. In this way, blogs make it easy to communicate with patrons and to build online communities.

In the Chapter 4, RSS (Rich Site Summary) is introduced as an excellent way to keep track of important trends and up-dates on the Web. RSS therefore makes content more accessible on the patrons X  side while content of multiple websites is featured on a single page. In the next chapter (Chapter 5), Farkas turns to wikis and contends that with simplified, easy-to-learn rules, wikis put experienced Web designers and Web novices on an equal footing. In libraries, wiki could let everyone generate content on the Web; libraries by employing wikis can create a platform where everyone even with little technical knowhow can share personal knowledge and experiences.

The Chapter 6 is dedicated to online communities. The basic idea is that libraries can build online communities where different parties are coming together and share their ideas. In the next chapter, the author discuses the emergence of online identities and the concept of social networking. She believes that modern libraries should realize the implications of these and the ways of providing related services. For instance, they can learn where their patrons are hanging out online through websites like Facebook. This can help them engage in viral marketing to promote library services.
