 The advantage of Process-Aware Information Systems (PAIS), such as workflow systems, is an overall increase of efficiency and structure. However, a problem of such systems is their potential to support  X  X hain production in the office X  [1][2]. Skepticism of users address the rigidity and monotony of work, and the limitations of flexibility and development. Such negative perceptions can have decreasing effects on the users X  satisfacti on, motivation, and their performance.
Human orientation in PAIS is particularly relevant in industries where pro-cesses require human knowledge, skills, competencies, experience, judgments and decisions. In these industries, such as service markets, human capital embodies the most valuable capital of a company. In such a context, human orientation in Information Systems and the conseq uent user acceptance of such systems is a critical issue for high performance and business success. Human orientation in the context of PAIS may refer to both, the inclusion of humans (by considering human behavior and demands) and the integration of humans (by assimilating humans attributes such as experiences, qualifications and other capabilities) into the system. A PAIS that includes and integrates humans in such a way for us means a Human-Centric Process-Aware Information System (HC-PAIS) [3].
In this work we aim at integrating experiences into HC-PAIS to use them as a critical factor for task allocation which supports experience breeding. By experience breeding we understand the progression, maintenance and negligence of experience levels. Experience breeding is guided by experience breeding goals expressed by users (task performers) in natural language within the HC-PAIS. To the best of our knowledge, this allocation approach is novel and has not been considered so far in PAIS solutio ns and research. Although PAIS offer tremendous potentials to measure experience values in a reliable way and to keep these values up-to-date, the concept of e xperience has been a mainly unexploited research area in PAIS. Our contribution includes: 1. The integration of experiences with tasks and users for which we propose an 2. Algorithms for fine-tuning typical role-based task allocation which prioritize 3. The implementation of experience breeding (see Sections 3 and 4). 4. The discussion of a simulation design, preliminary results, and the effects of The research methodology of this work includes: (a) the conceptual design of experience breeding based on previous work [4] and on the theoretical back-bone presented in Section 2.2, and (b) t he evaluation of the design by means of prototyping and simulation. In our pr evious work [4] we extracted experience measurements from job offers and literature addressing PAIS and psychology that can be effectively supported by PAIS. These measurements we use in this work to elaborate an experience breedin g rule that measures experience vari-ances (Section 4). Furthermore, we pres ent our approach by means of a fictive company GARDEN which is specialized on designing and creating gardens (Sec-tion 5). The application scenario is used to illustrate our concept and to yield synthetic data for our simulation. In addition to our contributions presented in the Sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as listed above, Section 7 provides related work, and Section 8 concludes our work and provides an outlook on future work. In this section we present our conceptu al meta model for experience breeding and provide theoretical background on which our concept is based on. 2.1 Conceptual Model The Experience Breeding Meta Model (E BreMM) for HC-PAIS is represented as Entity-Relationship Diagram [5] and depicted in Figure 1. In essence, the EBreMM extends user-role-task relationships as typically employed by PAIS by the concept of Experiences , Goals ,and Levels as well as the relationships between them (highlighted in gray). Experiences can be assigned to Users and activated by certain Ta s k s .The Ta s k s can be used throughout several Processes . Experiences can be expressed at different Levels and serve as vehicle to achieve certain Goals . The EBreMM defines the data structure required for experience breeding at design time. We explain the EBreMM by means of an application scenario which is presented in Section 5.
 2.2 Theoretical Background In the following we provide the theoretical background to the entities of the EBreMM that are essential for experien ce breeding, such as Goal, Experience, Level, Task, and Role. We understand a process as a collection of tasks and a user as an employee (human) perfo rming the task (task performer).
 Goal. In motivational theory (e.g. [6][7][8]), goals have appeared in various forms. According to the goal-setting theory of [6], goals can be subdivided into goals set by others , such as a company, and self-set goals (individual goals). In manage-ment literature [9][10], various types of organizational goals have been brought up, such as strategic and assigned goals, and which can be interpreted as  X  X oals set by others X . Self-set goals include, e.g., performance goals and learning goals [7], whereas self-defining goals refer to a person X  X  self-definition, e.g. becoming a competent computer scientist [11][7]. Th ere are strong indications that if a task is perceived as relevant for achieving a self-set/self-defining goal, this task will be preferred and better performed. We assume that such goals support moti-vation. We therefore suggest patterns for self-set/self-defining goals (Section 3) that users can enter into the HC-PAIS. We further assume that typically goals set by the organization and self-set/self-defining goals are partially congruent. An analysis of how goal relationships may affect strategic/tactic planning of organizations is beyond the scope of this paper will be discussed in future work. Experience. In psychological literature (e.g. [12][13]) work experience has been understood as multidimensional and multilevel construct (compare also with [4]). Work experience is collected by a person during the performance of some job in a work setting [13][14][12]. We understand experiences as being formed in daily real-world work settings where as we consider competencies as being formed in particularly designed training units (e.g. [15] [16] [17]). Requirements to capture information about work experience include: (a) a definition of the domain of interest (e.g. individual employee, groups, organization), (b) the level of experience measurement specificity (e.g. task, job, organization, industry), and (c) experience measurements and functions to define the movement between levels. Task experience has been identified as an important contribution to job knowledge [18] and experience with similar tasks can increase an employee X  X  performance [18][12]. In our work we assume that a process task requires and activates particular experiences and t hat these experiences can be possessed and increased by a user through p erforming that task. We also believe that experience can be tiered into levels, and scaled by means of rules.
 Level. Levels are used to incorporate goal-based motivation, similar to levels as used in, e.g., role-playing games [19]. Levels are based on a particular measure-ment concept (rules) and are usually distinguished based on their labeling. There are innumerable ways of labeling experience levels, for example Basic specialist , Senior specialist , Expert specialist , Very expert specialist ,and Discipline advisor [20], Novice , Moderate ,and Expert [21], and Novice , Expert ,and Guru [22]. As there seems to be no common labeling parti cularly for experience levels, we used the three levels Noob (default level for new users or an experience at a low level), Valuable (an experience at a mean level), and Specialist (experience at a high level). However, the labels and the number of levels can be individually adjusted by a company. In previous work [4] a coll ection of experiences measurements was provided that can be supported by a PAIS. We use these measurements for an experience breeding rule which is presented in Section 4.
 Task. Ataskis  X  X  description of a piece of work that forms one logical step within a process. [...] [It]requires human and/or machine resources(s) to support process execution; where human resource is required an [task] is allocated to a [process performer (user)] X  [23, p. 13]. In [24] tasks are further categorized into different kinds of tasks such as automated tasks, service tasks, and user tasks. In this work we are particularly interested in user tasks which are understood as being performed by a human with the support of a software application [24]. Each task is assigned at least to one role. A task activates at least one experience. If a task has more than one experiences, then it needs to be defined how much percent of the task is occupied by which experience (contribution, see Figure 1). Importance is a value that is composed of a manually set value by a company during design time and a calculation of the critical path during run time. Related to task importance is task priority as presented in [24, p. 167]. Role. In typical PAIS, the concept of roles is used to link users with tasks [25]. There are two approaches for designing roles: From a technology-driven view, roles are a mechanism that associates user s to tasks [23][26]. From an enterprise-driven perspective, roles are a mechanism to group users with a specific set of capabilities [23][25]. Our experience breeding concept uses the concept of roles as foundation. Tasks are basically assigned to users by means of roles. However, and to the best of our knowledge, our contribution goes beyond state of the art by considering experience b reeding on top of the select ion of users according to roles. Consequently, experience breeding can be understood as an extension that fine-tunes role-based allocation of users to tasks. In this section we present experience breeding goals which express the users X  wishes how to shape their experiences as employees of a company. Allowing the users to actively shape their participation in day-to-day business acts as a strong motivational system. We assume that (a) users X  motivation will increase when users can enter goals set by themselves into the system, (b) tasks that are perceived as relevant for the goals will be preferred and better performed by the users, and (c) when the provided tasks are perceived as relevant for the goals, then the satisfaction with experience breeding will increase. The basis for experience breeding is to make users experience breeding goals available for the system. The goals could be, for example, discussed and formulated in annual staff appraisals. In order to simplify the translation between verbalized and machine readable goals, we elaborated a set of goal patterns. These goal patterns are intended to cover a set of wishes, that users may formulate regarding their participation in a PAIS, or more general, in a company. Users should be able to address in their goals:  X  Levels of experiences,  X  Experiences,  X  Experiences in a particular task,  X  Experiences in tasks of a particular process,  X  Experiences in tasks assign ed to a particular role.
 Furthermore, users should be able to state in which direction they want to shape their experiences. Hence, the experience breeding goals should support the col-lection, maintenance and neglection of experiences and their levels.  X  X ollection X  means to breed the particular experienc e to the next higher level.  X  X aintenance X  means to keep the current level of the partic ular experience.  X  X eglection X  implies to breed the particular exper ience to the next lower level. To neglect experiences in HC-PAIS means that for the particular user, tasks will be prioritized that do not, or only to a small percentage, include the particular experience. In the case of an experience neglection goal, we assume, that the user X  X  satisfaction with the system using experience breeding will increase, if the tasks that include the particular experience will be provided less often to him.
 The five experience goal patterns are presented in the Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The theoretical foundation on which the goal patterns are based on is presented in Section 2.2.
 Pattern 1: Breed Level for Experience. The user can formulate an experience breeding goal that directly addresses the desired level of the experience. For example,  X  X ecome SPECIALIST at DEALING WITH CUSTOMERS until 29th June 2014 X  . We propose the conversion of the following experience breeding goals into Pattern 1. The advantages of the transformation include an easy identifi-cation of contradictions between different goals. Furthermore, if Pattern 1 is explicitly used to formulate a goal, this goal receives the highest priority com-pared to goals based on the Patterns 2-5. Hence, the patterns allow us to rank the priority of the goals set by a user.
 Pattern 2: Breed Experience. The user can also formulate an experience breeding goal that addresses the experience without explicitly mentioning the desired level but by using the keywords collect , maintain ,and neglect . For example,  X  X eglect experience with DEALING WITH CUSTOMERS X  .
 Pattern 3: Breed experience for a task. As a task is described by means of expe-riences and contributions representing the percent of the task that the experi-ence occupies (see Section 2), experience breeding goals may also address tasks. For example,  X  X ollect experiences for task PREPARE QUOTATION X  .Thetask PREPARE QUOTATION is described by the experiences Calculating offers ,and Describing offer details , which both of them occupy 50% of the task. Hence, the user X  X  current levels of the two experiences will be breeded towards the next higher level.
 Pattern 4: Breed experience for a process. An experience breeding goal can also address a process and consequently re fer to the experiences of all tasks of a particular process. For example, Maintain experiences for process SMALL CUS-TOMER GARDEN . Consequently, the user X  X  curre nt levels of all the experiences by which the tasks of the process SMA LL CUSTOMER GARDEN are described will be maintained. Pattern 5: Breed experience for a role. Although the experience breeding task allocation to users is basically guided by roles, the fine-tuning by considering experience breeding can take place by a ddressing experiences of roles as well: Roles have dedicated tasks, and tasks ar e described by means of experiences. Consequently, a goal addressing experiences for a role refers to the experiences of all tasks that are assigned to a particular role. Such an experience breeding goal is relevant for users who, for example, consider to apply for a different role they are currently performing in. For example, Collect experiences for role MANAGER . The user will still receive tasks tha t are assigned to his current role, e.g. the role LANDSCAPE DESIGNER, however, tasks will be prioritized that include experiences of tasks that are dedicated to the desired role MANAGER. Central for experience breeding is the me asurement of experiences. There have been several experience measurements m entioned in job offers and literature referring to PAIS and psychology research which were collected in our previous work [4]. In this work we want to provide an experience measurement rule that combines quantitative and qualitative experience measurements and that defines when an experience ascends to the next l evel, maintains at the same level, or descend to the next lower level. We considered four experience measurements:  X  Count (How often has an experi ence been collected?),  X  Duration (How long has an experie nce been collected?),  X  Importance (How important was the task performed?), and  X  Quality (How good was a task performed?).
 Figure 7 illustrates the proposed generic experience breeding rule to measure experiences with HC-PAIS. This rule is a mathematical function and supports us to achieve one value for an experience. The above listed four experience mea-surements are considered as inherent parts of the rule. The weights of each measurement and the operators (such as plus (+) or times (x)) that combine the components of the function can be assigned by the company for each expe-rience. Count represents a value which illustrates how often an experience was collected. Each time a task was performed that activates the particular expe-rience, the value is incremented. Duration represents values that illustrate how long an experience has been collected. The actual duration of the task performed is used as basis which is multiplied by the percent of the experience to which it is activated in the particular task. Importance is a qualitative measurement of experience, it illustrates the type of a task (e.g. [13] [12]). Quality represents values that show how good a task was performed. We understand measurements that address the quality of task performance as highly task-related and conse-quently as highly context sensitive. Quality measurements can be very specific and need to be defined in a department, company or a branch. For example, for the task writing a research paper task-result quality measurements could include the type of paper written (journal article, conference article, book chapter), the reputation or impact factor of the outlets, and feedback of the reviewer [4].
In regard to the experience measurement importance we suggest the compo-sition of the value of different importance values: the process importance value (e.g. with the weight of 60%), the task instance value (e.g. with the weight of 20%) which need to be manually determined by a company, and an importance value derived from the critical path (e.g. with a weight of 20%). In the case of the example values stated in the round brackets above the process importance value has a stronger influance on the resulting importance value than the task instance value or the value derived from the critical path. As the determination of experience breeding rules may emerge a s a sophisticated challenge for compa-nies, we will address this issue in more detail and provide experience breeding rule patterns, simulation methods and evaluation mechanisms in future work. In this section we illustrate our experience breeding approach by means of pro-cesses of a fictive company GARDEN which is specialized on designing and creating gardens for big and small customers.
 GARDEN uses a Human-Centric Process-Aware Information System (HC-PAIS) that is based on experience br eeding to manage its processes and to support the employees X  motivation and satisfaction. GARDEN has one process (with tasks such as T1: Examine location, T2: Check regulations with local au-thorities) which is illustrated in Figure 8. The company garden has different processes for big and small customers, which share many tasks. Martin, who is employed by GARDEN, performs tasks that belong to both. Overall, GARDEN has nine experiences activated by the tasks of the GARDEN process, as repre-sented top right in Figure 8, such as E1: Calculating offers and E2: Describing offer details.

Each experience is integrated with tasks, which is illustrated by means of the gray arrows reaching out of the tasks and pointing at the experiences in Figure 8. The task description is explained in more detail by means of the task  X  X raw Up Landscape Plan X  in Figure 9. The task  X  X raw Up Landscape Plan X  is described by: (1) The process the task belongs to and a value that indicates the importance of the task (read more about the importance value in Section 4). (2) The role to which the task is assigned to, in this case the task can only be performed by users acting in the role  X  X andscape Designer X  . (3) The experiences that are activated by the task. The task  X  X raw Up Landscape Plan X  , includes the experiences E3: Checking Feasibility and Identifying Requirements and E5: Designing Landscapes.
As illustrated in Figure 10 Martin is Landscape Designer (1). There are two further roles defined to perform tasks in GARDEN, the Manager and the Gar-dener . Martin has also experiences at particular levels (2), for example he has the level  X  X aluable X  at  X  X esigning Landscapes X  . In GARDEN there are three soaring levels used: Noob , the lowest level, Valuable , the mean level, and Specialist ,the top level. Martin has also goals which he has formulated by himself and which he made available to the system (3): For example, he wants to become Specialist at the experience Designing Landscapes .
For each experience particular measurements, such as count, duration, impor-tance and quality are used and combined to rules that define changes between experience levels (read more in Sect ion 4). Martin performs in his role Landspace Designer the task Draw Up Landscape Plan . The task activates the experience Check Feasibility and Identifying Requirements (see Figure 9). So far, no level for this experience is known for Martin. Therefore, the rule for the default level Noob is used, which is illustrated in Figure 11. The rule is composed of the at-tributes frequency , rating start , rating ,and difference (1), (see Figure 1). The rule is performed every six months (frequency), and considers the values from six months ago to now (rating start). The rating is composed of the experience measurements described above: Each time a task is performed that activates the experience will increase the value of co unt (2). The average duration (compare with Figure 11(3)) is calculated for the minimum of the values count, or the last ten invokes of the experience at t he most, which will then be subtracted from 30, the value that represents twice the typical duration (60 hours) minus the medium duration (30 hours). Quality is considered by summing up the last ten quality values (4), and the average of the importance of the last 10 tasks is calculated (5). The measurement values ar e further weighted (e.g. importance is weighted by the factor 0.2) and summed up. While rating represents the current standing of a user given a certain level, difference is used to determine if a user can ascend to the next level, or descend a level. The difference in Figure 11 de-fines an ascend of the level in the case of a value equal or greater 40. Otherwise, the level Noob will maintain, as there is no lower level. In this section, we present a simulation design to evaluate the results of the effects of experience breeding on task a llocation to human resources by using synthetic data derived from our fictive company GARDEN application scenario. The scenario of GARDEN has already been described in Section 5. The goal of the simulation is to verify the effectiven ess of the concepts introduced in this paper in comparison to more traditional role-based task allocation algorithms. 6.1 Simulation Design For a simplified simulation of the concepts presented in this paper, we can select the following parameters, and make the following assumptions 1 :  X  We allocate tasks to a set of 5 users (see bottom of 1 ). All start of with  X  As shown in Figure 11, the attribute frequency typically determines how  X  For the sake of simplicity we assume that all users have the same role. Thus  X  We randomly created 5000 task instances, belonging to either SMALL CUS-We can furthermore assume the following impact on duration and quality (see Section 2): (a) a Valuable user is between 10% and 20% better than a Noob user, (b) a Specialist user is between 5% and 10% better than a Valuable user. Please note, that these values have to be tested and evaluated by companies for the real world examples, and may thus differ for di fferent scenarios and experiences. For harnessing the advantages of experiences we used a simple Experience Breeding (EB) algorithm with the following properties:  X  If the importance of a task is higher than 60, a Specialist is selected.  X  If the importance of a task is between 50 and 60, a Valuable user is selected.  X  If the importance of a task is below 50, a Noob user is selected.  X  Balance the duration each user is working on tasks (this will lead to slightly  X  When multiple users of the same level exist, select one with a goal that A good candidate to comparing the above algorithm to is a simple Round Robin (RR) assignment of tasks to users. Please note that for the RR algorithm we also have consider that users move between le vels, in order to give a fair comparison. Thus, after running the simulation for EB and RR, it is possible to compare (a) the efficiency of task allocation regarding the duration/quality of tasks execution, and (b) the experience changes compared to the goals of the users. 6.2 Conditions, Preliminary Results, and Lessons learned The simulation was conducted based on a full implementation of the concepts/data structures presented within this paper.
 Conditions of the simulation: Multiple users were able to perform a task and could be rated according to the experience measurement and the goal accom-plishment. The simulation was not conducted based on the execution of processes (there is no connection to a workflow eng ine yet). Tasks were selected randomly out of the set of available tasks. Thus tasks might occur not exactly according to the proportions in the above described GARDEN scenario. In non-simulated scenarios a task X  X  quality/duration could be influenced by preceding tasks in the process. Such effects were not co nsidered by the simulation.
 Preliminary results: The preliminary result of the simulation was that Expe-rience Breeding (EB) performed be tter than Round Robin (RR) due to some predictable reasons. In more detail the simulation showed that:  X  EB supported the achievement of the users X  experience breeding goals. Thus,  X  There was a much higher count of Specialists after EB, also due to the  X  RR supported the cyclic assignment of tasks to users. Hence, Noob users  X  The workforce consisted mostly of users with the level  X  X aluable X  for the ex-Lessons learned: To represent the motivational effects on the simulation, it can be beneficial to introduce a special factor with impact on quality and duration. This factor is not yet included in the simulation design above, but will be ex-plored in future work to further improve the realism of the design. Also not yet included is the impact of users that work in a process: although each task may be allocated by a single user, the results (quality, duration) can alter properties of subsequent tasks. While some of these effects may be hard to quantify (e.g. higher duration, lower quality due to the results of previous tasks), it will be very well possible to factor in effects of task duration on a critical path, and increase/decrease the impor tance of a task accordingly. We discuss related work to modeling organizational aspects in PAIS, allocation of tasks, and measurement of experience.

Modeling organizational aspects in PAIS. Typically, organizational models are used to define and integrate organizational structures into PAIS [23][26][25]. The description of users is typically based on the concept of roles. Roles are used to link users with tasks [25]. So far, users have been addressed by means of the term  X  X uman resources X  in PAIS [27][2 8][29][30] and have been described by using different terms, such as  X  X apabilities X  [27][28],  X  X ompetencies X  X 31],  X  X eatures X  [27][28],  X  X ualifications X  [32][33]. According to our previous work we describe users by reference to previo us work experience and process work experience [4]. In contrast to competencies, we understand work experience as being developed in real work settings whereas the former we understand as being developed in specially designed training settings.

Allocation of tasks. Existing allocation patterns [27][28], such as capability-and history-based resource allocation, consider work experience as one of the capabilities according to which the assignment of tasks to users can be guided. In the case of capability-based allocation, once such an work experience value has been entered into the system it often remains the same up to a manual update so far. Work experience as a facto r for history-based allocation has been considered for identifying the most exp erienced users. In our work, we do not use the concept of experience exclusively to identify the most experienced user, we rather use integrate experiences in to PAIS to support a human-centric task allocation based on individual experience breeding goals of the user.
Measurement of work experience. Experience as capability of users in PAIS has been expressed as simple quantity [27], e.g. least number of failures, or years working in a particular field, or a simple quantity comparison such as  X  X ore executions = more experience X  [25][4]). We understand work experience as a multidimensional and multilevel const ruct with different experience measure-ments (count, duration, quality, and importance) combined in a function. In [20] an experience index calculation is presented which is based on user (actor) evaluation made by a unit manager. The manager has to subjectively indicate, among others, if an user is able to perform a task or not. In our work we provide an experience measurement concept that c onsiders qualitative and quantitative measurements to avoid subjective ratings. In [31] an ontology-based competency model is presented for integrating comp etencies into PAIS. Competencies were used to identify competency gaps that can immediately be addressed by spe-cific training. In our work, we consider work experience as a work around of competencies. This means that work experience can only be possessed when a user actually performs a task rather than participates a training unit. We dy-namically measure work experience by means of measurements and rules which consequently provide the current valu es of experience of users in a company. Experience gaps can be easily identified and addressed. In this work we presented experience br eeding for Process-Aware Information Systems (PAIS). Our contribution incl uded the Experience Breeding Meta Model (EBreMM) that supports the integration of experiences with tasks and users, five experience breeding goal patterns that support the formulation of user goals within the system, and an abstract experience measurement function that sup-ports companies to individually rule chan ces between experience levels. We pre-sented our approach by means of an application scenario and provided a simu-lation design and its preliminary results . In conclusion, experience breeding is particularly fruitful in an organizational environment that fulfills the following requirements:  X  The organization uses a Process-Aware Information System (PAIS).  X  The organization has several processes.  X  The processes include human tasks.  X  Users are organized with several roles in the PAIS.  X  There is more than one user assigned to a role.  X  Tasks of various processes can be allocated to the users (in the broadest  X  Experiences are preliminary identified for users and determined for tasks.  X  The organization is willing to use experience breeding.
 There are strong indications that exper ience breeding in PAIS will increase the users X  motivation and satisfaction and thus qualify a PAIS towards a HC-PAIS. The main advantages for users working with such a HC-PAIS are: First, users can express their experience breeding goals in the HC-PAIS in natural language and thus influence the allocation of tasks. Second, users can track their progress and extract their individual track record, e.g. in the case of changing the job. Us-ing a HC-PAIS with experience breeding ena bles enterprises to, e.g. identify and suggest available users for roles in a more objective way by taking into account user X  X  experiences that are reliable and kept up-to-date in the HC-PAIS (e.g. supported by experience measurements and functions), to identify and counter-act experience gaps in the pool of available users, and to select special users for special cases (e.g. specia list for escalations).

Our future work will address experience measurement functions, the detailed analysis of goals and mentoring with experience breeding.
