Planning entails the art of automatically generating a course of actions to best achieve certain goals under a set of rules and constraints. Planning is a core technology offered by artificial intelligence (AI) research. Over the past few years, automated planning technology has greatly advanced and been applied to many application domains. This ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology special issue on  X  X pplications of Automated Planning X  presents some of the most recent and exciting applications of AI planning technology.
After a rigorous reviewing process, we select six articles that represent the state-of-the-art of the field and showcase the wide spectrum of application domains of planning technology.

Planning has been used for interactive storytelling for more than ten years. In their article,  X  X pplying Planning to Interactive Storytelling: Nar-rative Control using State Constraints X , Porteous et al. apply planning to the problem of narrative generation in interactive storytelling. Exploiting recent progress in planning technology, they develop a unified approach to narra-tive generation that uses constraints as part of the representation of a story world to specify directorial knowledge. They also develop a planning approach that uses the constraints to decompose narrative generation in order to ad-dress scalability issues and the goal of real-time performance in larger story domains.

Modeling the dynamics of biological processes can enable high-throughput in-silico experiments that attempt to predict or intervene in these processes to accelerate the design of therapies. In the article,  X  X lanning Interventions in Biological Networks X , Bryce et al. pioneer the application of AI plan-ning algorithms to reasoning about interventions in biological processes. In their work, they apply AI planning-based search techniques and demonstrate their advantage in scalability over existing enumerative methods. They ap-ply the approach to three biological systems: the yeast cell cycle, a model of the human aging process, and the Wnt5a network governing the metasta-sis of melanoma in humans. Their results show great promise for planning approaches in this application. The scalability improvement from employing planning technology enable planning of previously unknown sequences of in-terventions and reveal novel and biologically significant responses in biological systems.

Refanidis et al. apply planning to help people better schedule their ac-tivities. Their article,  X  X  Constraint Approach to Scheduling an Individual X  X 
Activities, X  focuses on the challenging task of automatically managing an individual X  X  time under a variety of activities, constraints, and preferences. The article presents a rigorous, expressive model to represent an individual X  X  ac-tivities and a scheduler that operates on the rich model with extensive con-straint propagation and domain-dependent heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate the practically of this approach. Based on the planner, they have developed a Web-based intelligent calendar application that utilizes Google Calendar.

Benaskeur et al. apply planning to Air Force defense. They develop  X  X ORALS: A Real-Time Planner for Anti-Air Defense Operations X . The plan-ner is used for determining efficient allocation and coordinated use of combat resources in response to air threats such as coordinated raids of advanced ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. It is a very complex planning problem that deals with a huge amount of data under uncertainty and time pressure.
CORALS provides real-time decision-making support for a naval force defend-ing against multiple and multiple-axis simultaneous anti-ship missile threats.
In response to multiple simultaneous or sequential threats, CORALS uses an automated planner to generate a set of local plans, one for each target, and then combines them into a global plan using a plan merging and repairing mech-anism. Such an approach enables quick adaptation of previously generated plans under dynamic changes in the tactical situation.

Robot planning is a classical application domain of planning, and we fea-ture two articles on robot planning in this special issue. Talamadupula et al. present  X  X lanning for Human-Robot Teaming in Open Worlds X , which uses planning technologies to guide robots in human-robot teaming environments.
They adapt planning technology to urban search and rescue with a human-robot team. They show that several recent advanced features of planning technology, including temporal planning partial satisfaction planning and re-planning can be gainfully adapted to this application. They introduce a novel notion of conditional goals into the planning formulation, in order to help cope with the open-world assumption that is characteristic of human-robot teaming problems. Their planner with its open world extensions was integrated into a robot control architecture for empirical study of urban search and rescue planning.

Cirillo et al. present  X  X uman-Aware Task Planning: an Application to Mo-bile Robots X , which also addresses human-robot interaction using planning technology. Their article presents a planning system that plans the behaviors of robots by taking into account the actions that will be performed by the humans sharing the same environment. Their planner supports alternative hypotheses of the human plan, temporal duration for the actions of both the robot and the human, constraints on the interaction between robot and human, partial goal achievement and the possibility to use observations of human actions in the policy generated for the robot. Their work shows that the human-aware planning approach can improve human-robot cohabitation, for example, by avoiding undesired situations for the human.

This special issue provides our readers with advances in the research of planning and its most recent applications in a variety of fields. We hope that these articles can be a source of knowledge and creativity for those who want to explore the application of automated planning technology in their own work on intelligent systems.
