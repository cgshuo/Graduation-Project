 We present Match the News , a browser extension for real time news recommendation. Our extension works on the client side to recommend in real time recently published ar-ticles that are relevant to the web page the user is currently visiting. Match the News is fed from Google News RSS and applies syntactic matching to find the relevant articles. We implement an innovative weighting function to perform the keyword extraction task, BM 25 H . With BM 25 H we ex-tract keywords not only relevant to currently browsed web page, but also novel with respect to the user X  X  recent brows-ing history. The novelty feature in keyword extraction task results in meaningful news recommendations with regards to the web page the users currently visits. Moreover the extension offers a salient visualization of the terms corre-sponding to the users recent browsing history making thus the extension a comprehensive tool for real time news rec-ommendation and self assessment.
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Information filtering news recommendation, browser extension, novelty detection
News recommendation has been a very active area in re-search and industry in the last several years. This is due to the vast user community and the availability of many news streams. Matching users interests and recommending rele-vant news is a task that is highly challenging but also quite interesting for the industry as it is many times interleaved with advertising processes. In any case credible news recom-mendations increase the chances for retaining the user on a specific web page and thus match marketing or other targets. The news recommendation process is based on a user profile that is build based on explicit or implicit data. We simulate News Articles Collection and Dynamic Corpus.
 Implementing a corpus dependent weighting function on a system that works locally on the client X  X  device brings up the problem of corpus storage. Document collections usu-ally used for information retrieval tasks, including the com-puting of global weights such as IDF , present a cardinality ranging in millions, a size prohibitive for a locally operat-ing browser plug-in. Match the News develops an evolving corpus consisting of the last N pages the user visits, upon its installation. To effectively maintain such a collection, the plug-in database does not include the actual web doc-uments but only the statistical information for the last N documents, necessary in the BM 25 H formula, i.e. for each term present in the last N web pages, the tDF value and the time stamp of its last occurrence.

As Match the News works on the client side, the items available for recommendation must be locally accessible to select those matching the current user context. This is achieved by periodically collecting the news articles available through Google News RSS feed. Each news unit consists of the article title, a small description (snippet), the URL for the article and the publication date.

Keyword Extraction. Real time performance, is a cru-cial feature for a system that recommends news related to the content currently displayed to the user. This require-ment, primarily raises from users intolerance to delay, espe-cially for actions not directly related to their current intent. In addition, if the response time of the recommendation sys-tem is high, the probability of the user to leave the web page increases, and thus the recommendation process may not conclude. The recommendation process involves match-ing the web page vector to the respective of the news items. Comparing the full term vector of a web page in order to find the best matching articles can be expensive for large size web pages. To tackle this problem Match the News im-plements a keyword extraction algorithm to select the top-k terms from the web page.

Keyword extraction involves a term weighting function suitable for distinguishing the terms in a web page that bet-ter describe the concept presented. Match the News imple-ments an innovative weighting function, we introduced in [1], capitalizing on keyword novelty with regards to the key-words distribution within the user X  X  history. This method includes the maintenance of a pseudo-DF, tDF , which in-volves both the document frequency of a term as well as its distribution of occurrences over time and thus declines as the corresponding term stops occurring in the browsing history. Using the tDF to replace the regular document frequency, we introduced BM 25 H , a scoring function that penalizes terms frequently occurring in the browsing history of the user. These terms are often website specific stopwords such as its domain name or other terms globally present in websites, such as menu items (e.g. contact , home etc). More details and experimental evaluation on the scoring function can be found in [1].

The News Recommendation Process When an arti-cle reaches the system, it is stored in the database using the bag of words representation. The weighting scheme used for the is the normalized T F . Having the term vector for each article and the term vector of the current web page (resulting for the keyword extraction process), Match the News uses the cosine similarity measure to compute the similarity be-
