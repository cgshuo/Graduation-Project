 Computing the most similar k nodes w.r.t. a given query node, based on simi-larity measures such as RWR[ 12 ], PPR[ 14 ], and SimRank[ 13 ], has been studied a lot[ 3 , 12 , 19 , 20 ]. Recently, a novel query called perspective-aware query has been proposed to provide more insightful information to users[ 22 ]. In this paper, we follow perspective-aware query and focus on multi-relational network[ 1 , 4  X  6 , 17 ]. Figure 1 shows an example. We extract three relationships denoted by different colors and call them the base perspectives(R, G, B, for short), which help construct the hierarchy showed in figure 1(c) . We call higher hierarchy per-spectives compound perspectives. We are interested in how to quickly compute a top-k query list under any compound perspective ? overcome inherent search engine bias, and over the years, it has been studied a lot[ 11 ]. We draw an analogy between top-k query lists obtained under some perspectives and biased lists returned by search engines, then top-k query list under compound perspective is compared to the list returned by rank aggre-gation methods. What X  X  more, based on Eigen-SimRank model, we develop a and  X   X  W .As  X  W way that we update L t and V t . We adopt two rank aggregation methods, namely Borda method and footrule algorithm[ 8 ]. We encoded them in C program, and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency along with Eigen-SimRank model and dynamic updating algorithm. We set the default value of parameter c =0 . 2. Table 1 and table 2 show the details of our datasets.
 Effectiveness Evaluation. We adopt the widely-used NDCG measure[ 7 ]. Figure 2(a) and 2(b) shows the NDCG scores, with dynamic updating algorithm achieves the highest accuracy around 90%, and on average 85%. Although Borda method and Footrule algorithm perform not as good as dynamic updating algo-rithm, they still hold the average accuracy up to 80% and 77%, respectively. As for DBLP dataset, for NDCG@25, Borda method and Footrule method achieve 85% and 84%, respectively.
 Efficiency Evaluation. Figure 2(c) -2(e) display the runtime on synthetic datasets, and figure 2(f) , 2(g) on DBLP dataset correspondingly.  X  X -S X ,  X  X  U X ,  X  X  X ,  X  X  X  are short for Eigen-SimRank and dynamic updating, Borda and Footrule respectively. On the whole, Borda method and Footrule algorithm per-form better than both Eigen-SimRank model and dynamic updating algorithm. However, Eigen-SimRank is not so bad considering the better performance when compared to NI Sim algorithm[ 7 ] when k is larger than 15 (k is a parameter) as Figure 2(f) showed. We choose SimRank as the proximity measure, and re-write the original iter-ative equation into a non-iterative one, named Eigen-SimRank, we apply it to
