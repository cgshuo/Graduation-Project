 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Keywords -Novelty Detection, New Event Detection Novelty detection is a task concerned with automatically detecting text containing new information; fo r example determining if a news story deals with an event not previously seen. The primary goal for source types. In addition to news st ories, sources like press releases, scientific papers, patent applica tions, and technical reports are of interest. In particular scientific and technical publications are the focus of the research. The intent is to keep abreast of significant new developments, and to detect br eakthrough discoveries and emerging trends. Novelty detection has received much attention from many research communities. One of these is Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) identifying new events by looking at sequences of news stories over time, and attempting to identify which referred event not previously encountered [1]. Currently an investigation of whether the techniques developed in TDT fo r new event detection can be repurposed and adapted to monitor technical and scientific sources to identify new devel opments is underway. News sources have previously been the predominant focus of evaluation in TDT. The TDT corpus [2] includes both newswire and transcribed spoken news sources, and has served as the primary tool for evaluation. In order to ca rry out experiments on types of documents other than the news st ories found in the TDT corpus, a new test collection must be created or an existing one with the desired content repurposed. The TR EC Genomics track corpus [3] will be repurposed to serve as a tool for experimentation with non-news sources, as it provides a c onvenient source of scientific documents with re levance judgments. One of the key interests in the current investigation of a TDT-based approach to novelty detection on different sources is the re-assessment of the evaluation criteria for the new event detection task in TDT. The traditional means of evaluating new event detection in TDT research has required finding th e very first story associated with a given event, or that even t would be considered undetected. Relaxing this criterion and allowing the detection of a topic-associated story within a given tim eframe; for example the first hour or day, will have a significant impact on the number of topics detected successfully. Since detecting story-topic associations serves as a means for identifying new events, this modification should improve the chance of detecting new events. Investigating different timeframe s and examining how different sources and topics / events pe rform across various timeframes addresses an important question. The objective of these experiments is two-fold: first, to find a sweet s pot in the trade-off between loss of speed of detection of new events and the improved chance of detection, and second, to determin e what timeframes are suitable for different sources. For example, in a news environment, a relatively short timeframe for detection may be appropriate, such as within the first hour. On the other hand, when dealing with scientific papers it may be sufficient to allow a si gnificantly longer timeframe; for example, a month. The second goal of the dissertation is to extend novelty detection across languages as well as different sources. There are two aspects to this goal. The first is to dete rmine what multi-language strategies are best suited to different sour ce types. Experimenting with both translation and joint representations will be followed by attempts to extend and adapt existing strategies for this specific task. For example, many scientific fields share some specific vocabulary across different languages. This property may allow improved techniques for linking documents across languages, thus improving the performance of novelty detection. It is the author's hope that this re search will lead to a practical way of monitoring various technical and scientific sources for new developments, and that the current experiments with a TDT-based approach may give some new impul ses to the new event detection task.
