 Dear readers, In this first issue of 2011, we open with news from the KDD conference, for which the new Industry Practice Expo track is being introduced by its co-chairs: Rajesh Parekh and Ying Li.
 The second section of this edition is dedicated to the topic of Privacy in Mo-bility Data Mining ,containingfourinterestingar ticles, invited and guest edited by Aris Gkoulalas-Divanis, Y  X  ucel Saygin, and Dino Pedreschi. The increasing popularity of mobile computing devices results in growing amounts of mobile data containing the exact locations of its users. Obviously, such data contains enormous amounts of information which can be used for all kinds of interesting and useful applications, but it immediately also comes with a serious concern of privacy, posing interesting challenges to the data mining community. The four articles in this special issue cover di ff erent research directions in the area of privacy for mobility data, all nicely introduced by the guest editors. In the next section, Irwin King and Hang Li report about the Web Search and Data Mining conference. The conference was held in Hong Kong from february 9-12, and has been very successful already for the fourth time in a row. The last section contains two contribut ed articles. Manish Gupta and Jiawei Han present a survey on Heterogeneous Network-Based Trust Analysis, and Conny Junghans, Marcel Karnstedt, and Michael Gertzthe proposes a general model for Quality-Driven Resource-Adaptive Data Stream Mining.
 To conclude, I wish to thank the authors and the guest editors for their contri-butions and I hope you will enjoy reading this issue.
 Happy reading, Bart Goethals Editor-in-Chief July 2011 Antwerp, Belgium bart.goethals@ua.ac.be
 Dear Colleague: Welcome to volume 15(4) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal.

This issue of the IDA journal consists of nine articles, all related to the applied and theoretical research in the fi eld of Intelligent Data Analysis.
 The fi rst three articles are more aligned with unsupervised learning. In the fi rst article of this issue, Yanto et al. investigate a new approach to data clustering in which they propose a data clustering approach using rough set theory to deal with problems in categorical data. The algorithm is based on a variable precision rough set model. Their results show that the propsoed approach provides better performance in selecting the clustering attributes. Shani et al. in the second article focus on unsupervised segmentation of sequence of symbols into chunks and present an unsupervised learning algorithm to perform this task. Their algorithm that builds a lexicon of segments and computes a maximum likelihood segmentation given the current lexicon, is most appropriate for hierarchical sequences where smaller segments are grouped into larger segments. This algorithm is compared to previous approaches and the authors present segmentation results from the interactions of a web service and its clients. Hajian et al. in the third article of this issue discuss the problem of data privacy in data mining and introduce a privacy preserving clustering technique suitable for horizontally and vertically distributed data sets. Their proposed method contains some form of wavelet transforms and scaling data perturbation to achieve both data hiding and data reduction so that all numeric attribute values are protected. The experiments presented in this article have shown that the proposed technique provides better privacy and clustering results comparing to existing methods.

The next four articles of this issue are on pattern discovery. Umek and Zupan emphasize the need for identifying subsets of data instances with similar outcome description and present a method that directly addresses this problem. Their experiments with the proposed method on a set of synthetic and real life social survey data demonstrate the strength of their approach to discover relevant and interesting subgroups from the data with multi-dimensional purposes. In the fi fth article of this issue, Yun and Ryu discuss different aspects of the topic of weight based sequential pattern mining and emphasize that in noisy environments a small change in weights or supports of items affects the results. They propose a robust concept of mining weighted approximate sequential patterns in which an approximate factor is de fi ned to relax the requirement for exact quality between weighted supports of sequential patterns and a minimum threshold. Their proposed approach is extensively evaluated in several experiments and the results are presented in the paper. Deypir and Sadreddini in the next article discuss some of the challenges in mining frequent patterns such as reduction in runtime and memory usage and propose a novel method for ef fi cient mining of frequent patterns in data streams. Their proposed method is based on a sliding window model which divides selected windows into a number of panes. This approach that dynamically adapts itself with concept change is empirically evaluated against some existing methods. Their experimental results on synthetic and real life data streams show the better performance of their approach on runtime and memory usage. Zliobaite X  X  article on concept drift explains the challenge in supervised learning for sequential data. It includes a method for training set selection which is more suitable for cases where concept drift is gradual. The proposed method dynamically determines an optimal training set size at every time step using a cross validation approach. The experimental results show the best accuracy in the peer group on the real and arti fi cial drifting data. Ordonez in the next article of this issue discusses data preprocessing and data transformation in data base systems, which is an important and yet time consuming task in data mining. The article, being also an overview of data preprocessing methods, presents a set of examples and common solutions to data preparation and transformations. It also highlights which steps in data mining become more ef fi cient when proper data preprocessing is performed. And fi nally in the last article of this issue, Kimura et al. address the problem of parameter estimation in observed data of a social network. To do this, the authors formulate the likelihood to obtain the observed data which is a set of time sequence cases of infected nodes and propose an iterative method to search for the parameters that maximize this likelihood. Their results show the effectiveness of their approach on large data sets related to social networks.

In conclusion, we continue our efforts for organizing and publishing more special issues of IDA journal. We would also like to remind our readers about the IDA conference that will be held in Porto, Portugal from October 29 X 31, 2011. For details, conference dates and other information please refer to the following web site (h ttp://www.liaad.up.pt/id a2011/). We look forward t o receiving your feedback along with more and more quality articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the fi eld of IDA.

 Dear Colleague: Welcome to volume 15(5) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal.

This issue of the IDA journal consists of nine articles, all related to the applied and theoretical research in the fi eld of Intelligent Data Analysis.

The fi rst four articles are about all forms of classi fi cations. Borchani et al .inthe fi rst article argue the complexity of mining concept drifting data streams and propose a new semi-supervised approach for handling these data sets. Their approach is based on monitoring three kinds of drifts which are feature, conditional and dual. The idea which is quite general, is to develop new classi fi ers when a drift occurs based on these parameters. Experimental studies reported in this paper are based on a na  X   X  ve Bayes classi fi er and also logistic regression and it is from both synthetic and real data. In the second article of this issue, Delibasic et al . discuss the idea of white box data mining in which the algorithms and their use would be transparent to the users. The authors present a component based algorithm design platform that can be used in several forms such as single or joint in fl uence. Two new heuristics in decision tree algorithm design are part of what is proposed in this paper and their evaluation is based on 80 component based decision tree algorithms on 15 benchmark data sets. Their results showed that one should search for optimal component interplay instead of looking for the optimal among prede fi ned algorithms. Peng and Li in the third article of this issue argue that few attempts exist in subspace clustering on multi-way data and propose a new subspace clustering approach. They show that their proposed algorithm can simultaneously perform subspace identi fi cation through various data clustering approaches. Their experimental results on both synthetic and real world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. And Pereira et al . in the next article propose a new attribute selection strategy that is based on lazy learning and essentially it postpones the identi fi cation of relevant attributes until a new instance is submitted for classi fi cation. Their strategy relies on the hypothesis that the attribute values of an instance to be classi fi ed may contribute to identifying the best attributes for the correct classi fi cation of that particular instance. Their experimental results on over 40 data sets show the effectiveness of their approach as part of which they propose a new metric to estimate when a speci fi c data set can bene fi t from the lazy attribute selection approach.

The next two articles in this issue are on data preprocessing. Monta  X  nes et al . address a physical system parameter evaluation problem and propose a greedy algorithm that is based on polynomial stepwise regression. This method is to solve the problem of understanding the degree of being polynomial for a set of attributes in physical systems. Their approach is evaluated on some arti fi cial data and some real data sets where they show their method successfully outperforms some learning methods in terms of effectiveness and ef fi ciency. Malik and Unwin in the sixth article of this issue emphasize the importance of data quality and present a framework for automatically detecting unusual or erroneous data values in data sets. The main idea behind their approach is to generate association rules to identify the exceptional cases. Their experimental results show that their proposed framework is able to successfully identify erroneous values in large data sets.

The last three articles of this issue are mostly on applied research. Chen and Wang X  X  article is about forecasting where they propose an approach that is a mix of a hybrid fuzzy linear regression and back propagation network. In their evaluation some historical data on global CO2 concentration are used to evaluate the effectiveness of their methodology where the results are quite impressive. Next article by Park et al . is about time series forecasting where the authors discuss the limitations of some arti fi cial intelligence methods in re fl ecting the dynamic characteristics of fi nancial time series. Instead, the authors suggest a new method that constructs the trend forecasting model of fi nancial time series. This method is evaluated using some fi nancial index data and its superiority is demonstrated in the article. In the last article of this issue, Makanju et al . address the problem of machine learning detectors for deployment of real life networks and propose a combination of genetic programming and arti fi cial neural nets as part of their machine learning paradigm. Their evaluation results on a number of data sets show that a machine learning based detector can be signi fi cantly enhanced or limited by the representation of the training data.

In conclusion, we continue our efforts on organizing and publishing special issues of IDA journal, sometimes 1 X 3 per year. Currently, there are three special issues under development that are at different stages of completion. The IDA conference that is usually held every two years in Europe, will be held in Porto, Portugal from October 29 X 31, 2011. For details, important dates and other information please refer to the following we b site (http://www.liaad. up.pt/ida2011/). We look forward to receiving your feedback along with more and more quality articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the fi eld of IDA.

 Dear Colleague: Welcome to volume 15(6) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal.
 This issue of the IDA journal consists of nine articles, that represent a variety of topics, all related to the applied and theoretical research in the fi eld of Intelligent Data Analysis.
 The fi rst three articles are about classi fi cation aspects of learning. In the fi rst article, Lee and Giraud-Carrier discuss the topic of unsupervised meta learning and argue the notion of diversity among learners used in ensemble learning. This is the prime motivation for their efforts in designing a distance function for clustering of learning algorithms. They use classi fi er output difference to cluster 21 learning algorithms and show how this clustering differs from clustering based on accuracy. Dendamrongvit et al. in the second article of this issue discuss the problem of multi-label classi fi cation problem and focus on text categorization problem. Two problems that they address are: characterization of each class by a different set of attributes and the induction of individual classes from imbalanced training sets. They propose an induction system to solve these two problems and evaluate this system using some synthetic data. Cerri et al. in the next article discuss the problem of assigning classes to instances in the case of multi-label classi fi cation problems and propose two new hierarchical multilabel classi fi cation methods that are aimed at hierarchical classi fi cation. They compare their methods with two global approaches and a well known local library approach and present their results with some bioinformatics data sets.
In the fourth article of this issue, Gao et al. discuss the need for integration of data mining tasks with knowledge representation and propose a set based approach that is suitable for mining frequent sequential patterns. Their approach improves the performance of Apriori based algorithms, takes advantage of an incremental mining method and provides a rich knowledge representation environment. Their article includes comparison of the performance of their approach to a number of sequential patterns mining algorithms. Alizadeh et al. in the next article propose two exploration strategies targeting applications in n-person general-sum multiagent reinforcement l earning and introduce an es timated value for taking actions in games with respect to other agents X  preferences. Their simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. Darcey et al. in the sixth article of this issue discuss the extensive usage of radio frequency identi fi cation in wireless communications and emphasize the need for proper detection of anomalies. They pr opose a methodology which i ncorporates a h ighly intelligent feature set de fi nition. Their experimental evaluation shows that their approach cleans highly ambiguous false positive observation data.

The next two articles are mostly on applied research. Tabia and Leray X  X  article is on alert correlation where they address three important issues related to predicting severe attacks by analyzing inoffensive and preparatory attacks. The main advantages of their approach is its integration and its effectiveness on prediction of false alarm rates with minimum expert intervention. Silla and Freitas discuss the complex task of protein function prediction and argue that there are several ways to extract features from a protein. They address this problem by employing three alternative selective hierarchical classi fi cation problems. The analysis of their results have shown that their selective representation approach is almost always ranked as number 1 when compared against fi xed representations.
The last article of this issue is a report of a data mining and business analytics conference that was held last year, a session of which was a panel discussion. This is a report related to a number of topics discussedduring this event, issues raised and also trends indicating what is the future of business analytics and intelligent optimizations.

In conclusion, with this last issue (number 6) of Volume 15 of the IDA journal, we continue our efforts on organizing and publishing one of the best journals in this community. Currently, there are a few special issues under development that are at different stages of completion. The IDA conference, that is usually held every two years in Europe, was held in Porto, Portugal from October 29 X 31, 2011. As usual, this was a successful event. We look forward to receiving your feedback along with more and more quality articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the fi eld of IDA. With our best wishes,
 Dear Colleague: Welcome to volume 16(1) of Intelligent Data Analysis journal.
 With this issue of the IDA journal, that consists of eight articles, we start our sixteenth year of success. As customary, this issue represents a variety of topics, all related to the applied and theoretical research in the fi eld of Intelligent Data Analysis.

The fi rst three articles are about algorithm development. Muelas et al. on the fi rst article of this issue discuss the topic of dynamic or adaptive combination strategies and propose a new methodology for developing intelligent adaptive hybrid algorith ms that use data mining techniques to analyze the results from previous executions. They evaluate their proposed methodology on a number of well known benchmark data sets where they demonstrate results that are signi fi cantly better than existing approaches. Jorge and Azevedo in the second article of this issue propose a framework for de fi ning and discovering optimal association rules involving a numerical attribute in the consequent. The optimality that is considered here is with respect to leverage where the generated rules are called maximum leverage rules. The authors present different methods for generation of maximum leverage rules where they take into account both optimality and readability of the d iscovered rules. Their evaluation shows that their discovery process is scalable. Hernandez-Leon et al. in the third article propose a novel classi fi er that is based on class association rules. This classi fi er introduces a new strategy for computing class association rules using a measure of interest that allows exploring the particular search space for building speci fi c rules with the highest value. The authors also introduce a new way for ordering the set of class association rules in which an ensemble strategy is applied.

The next two articles are about unsupervised learning. Al-Aghbari et al. discuss the importance of being able to properly identify clusters in data streams and propose a clustering technique to fi nd clusters in multiple data streams. Their proposed algor ithm applies a Discrete Four ier Transformation to reduce the dimensiona lity of data streams and pres ent each stream by a point in a multidimensional grid. Their experiments on synthetic data streams show the superiority of their algorithm in terms of speed which makes it suitable for sensor network applications. Oliveira and Gama in the fi fth article of this issue address the problem of monitoring the evolution of clusters over time and propose a framework to trace this evolution through the d etection and categorization of cluster transitions. They evaluate their approach based on two objectives, which are: to determine general evolution trends and to detect abnormal behavior or rare events. Their approach is evaluated on economy and fi nal problems.
The last three articles of this issue are mainly focused on applied research. Moradi et al. discuss automatic skill acquisition in reinforcement learni ng and propose a new graph theoretic approach to automatically identify and evalua te subgoals which a re related to skills in rein forcement learning. They propose a method that uses prior knowledge necessary for skill development. The method is based on two graph centrality measures which are node connection graph stability and co-betweenness centrality. Their method is evaluated using some benchmark data. The seventh article by Olasha et al. is on functional characterization of drug-protein interaction networks. The authors present their results of the study and analysis of the relationship between drugs and proteins that they target. Their aim is to identify protein properties that might guide the drug discovery process using interaction networks. Their analysis involves using social network models where drugs and proteins are studied using rich matrices. The last article of this issue, by Martins et al. is mostly on data visualization where they present a methodology which enables the graphical representation of atmospheric pollutants in a bi-dimensional Euclidean Sp ace. The approach presented in t his article relies o n the use of multidim ensional unfolding which is an exploratory multivariate data analysis method. Evaluation of their proposed approach using simulated data is also presented in this article.

In conclusion, with this fi rst issue of Volume 16 of the IDA journal, we continue our efforts on organizing and publishing one of the best journals in this community. Currently, there are a few special issues under development that are at different stages of completion. The IDA conference, that is usually held in Europe, this year was held in Porto, Portugal from October 29 X 31, 2011. As usual, this was a successful event that consisted of technical, poster and Ph.D. presentations. We look forward to receiving your feedback along with more and more quality articles i n both applied and theoretical research related to the fi eld of IDA.

 Dear Colleague: Welcome to volume 16(2) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal.

This issue of the IDA journal consists of ten articles that represent a variety of topics, all related to the applied and theoretical research in the fi eld of Intelligent Data Analysis.

The fi rst three articles are about feature selection and optimization. In the fi rst article, Chen et al . discuss the complexity of feature selection in a high dimensional data and propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm that is based on the opposite sign test. This particular test increases population diversity in a typical PSO and avoids local optima trapping. Their approach has been evaluated using a number of UCI data sets where the classi fi cation accuracy is shown to be higher than genetic algorithms and sequential search. Chuang et al . in the second article also discuss the importance of feature selection and propose a PSO approach that is based on a complementary distribution strategy. Their novel approach introduces new complementary particles that replace the selected particles when the global particle fi tness is monitored. Their experimental results show that their approach preserves knowledge of good feature selection combinations and thus can fi nd optimum combination of features. Kaedi and Ghasem-Aghaee in the next article of this issue present a Bayesian Optimization approach to overcome the challenge of using past experiences to solve problems based of a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach. The approach consists of obtaining and storing Bayesian networks in speci fi c case-bases where they are retrieved and applied for future cases. The most important advantages of their method is fi rst it is not problem dependent, and second previous solutions are stored using a probabilistic descriptions which makes the use of stored knowledge more fl exible.

The next three articles are about unsupervised and supervised learning. Perez-Suarez et al .discuss some challenges in proper clustering of data where objects may belong to more than one cluster and introduce a dynamic clustering system. The proposed system, that has a graph-cover strategy for building a set of clusters that normally overlap, h as also the capability of dynamically updating clusters through managing multiple additions and or deletion o f objects. Their article includes a number of their experiments with their results. Baumgartner and Serpen in the fi fth article of this issue present a new design heuristic for hybrid classi fi er ensembles in machine learning. Their heuristic includes both global and local learners which allow heterogeneous and homogeneous diversity through the co-existence of global and local learners. The article includes evaluation of their approach for hybrid classi fi cation using Weka machine learning with a group of 46 data sets from UCI data collection. Johansson et al ., in the next article of this group, discuss the limitations of ensemble classi fi cations and present a method for improving predictive performance through generating transparent models. The idea is based on using the oracle coaching approach to predict class labels for some applications like production data in conjunction with the original training set. The results of this work is shown to be robust for a variety of methods. It is also shown by the authors that all kinds of performance gains can be obtained by adjusting the relative weights of training and oracle data.

The article by Soroush et al . discusses the two most important issues in customer prediction systems, which are proper feature selection and the application of the most suitable prediction methods. They introduce a new customer prediction system that i s based on a hybrid approach and applies a multiple forward stepwise logistic regression model to achieve its goals. Among their applications, the authors used an insurance company data set to evaluate their system where they demonstrate its better prediction capability comparing to some existing techniques. Loslever et al . in the eighth article of this issue present a standard fi ve step model for statistical data analysis. Using two data sets, one simulated and the other a real data set, the authors compare use of two different methods to analyze these data sets based the fi ve step model that they introduce. Abdul-Rahman et al . in the ninth article of this issue discuss the vital role of preprocessing in classi fi cation and propose a framework for selecting discriminatory features from life science class of data prior to classi fi cation. The authors explore using a combination of several multivariate fi lters and particle swarm optimization with support vector machines for their feature reduction and selection processes. They evaluate their results based on a number of performance measures in which they show higher classi fi cation accuracy achieved by the proposed framework. And fi nally Velasquez in the last article of this issue explore the possibility of analyzing website text contents and propose a methodology to extract the main words in static web sites. The key element in this approach is to identify which pages in a web site can attract user attention when browsing is performed. To validate the approach the author uses web data originated in a complex static website from a Chilean bank where the results consisting of a set of key words are tested on a group of real users and the effectiveness of the approach is shown.

In conclusion, with this second issue of Volume 16 of the IDA journal, we continue our efforts on organizing and publishing one of the best journals in this community. There are two special issues planned for this year. Also, the next IDA conference that is usually organized in Europe, will be held in Helsinki, Finland on October 25 X 27, 2012. For det ails please refer to h ttp://ida 2012.org/. We look forward to receiving your feedb ack along with more and more qua lity articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the fi eld of IDA.

 Dear Colleague: Welcome to volume 16(3) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal
This issue of the IDA journal consists of nine articles which represent a variety of topics, all related to the applied and theoretical research in the fi eld of Intelligent Data Analysis.

The fi rst three articles are about classi fi cation and knowledge discovery. In the fi rst article, Kang and Cho propose a kernel-based binary classi fi cation algorithm which is an extension of support vector domain description for one-class classi fi cation problems. The authors use a number of well-known data sets to evaluate the performance of their algorithm and compare their results with other kernel-based algorithms such as SVM. Their results show that their algorithm performs better in terms of classi fi cation and also capable of fi nding moderate sparse solutions with little parameter sensitivity. Gasmi et al. focus on functional dependencies in the dynamic databases and discuss that some na  X   X  ve algorithms that can ef fi ciently discover functional dependencies should be suf fi cient. The authors propose a new technique that makes use of some existing methods in a novel way. The approach is evaluated in the paper. Hu et al. in the third paper, discuss the importance of choos ing proper weights for scoring multiple rules and introduce properties of weighted scoring rules where in their scheme incorporates weights intro scores in a natural way. They show their scheme can overcome some of the drawbacks of classic weighted scoring methods. The article also includes results of their case study where they apply their method to outlier detection targeting an ultimate ranking problem.

The next three articles of this issue are about evaluation and comparison of some exiting data analysis techniques. Bouraoui et al. evaluate the performance of independent component analysis (ICA) with the intention of adapting the basic ideas to the well-known Iris recognition problem. Their article includes a comparative study between implemented ICA algorithms and some recent methods of Iris recognition where they demonstrate their experimental results using some well-known Iris data bases. Their conclusion is that the ICA approach is far more effective than other techniques. Mendes-Moriera et al. ,inthe fi fth article of this issue, discuss the problem of long term travel prediction in time series data and compare three non-parametric regression methods, where for each of these methods they study the best combination of input parameters. The article also includes the impact of applying different methods for pre-processing tasks and the accuracy of results from regression methods. The results include their experiments performed on some real data sets where they demonstrate that Random Forest was the most suitable method. The next article by Febrer-Hern  X  andez and Hern  X  andez-Plancar is also a review paper. The authors in this article discuss the importance of sequential pattern mining in today X  X  data analysis world and present the main characteristics of some of the most important sequential patterns mining algorithms. They also show a comparative performance study of these algorithms.

Olszewski in the seventh article of this issue propose a novel pattern mining method suitable for telecommunication fraud detection, where interesting fraud cases are identi fi ed using a threshold type classi fi cation algorithm. The proposed approach that is based on Kullback-Leibler divergence approach, includes an automatic threshold computation. The article includes the results of this study using some telecommunication data. Kamaruddin et al. in the eighth article of this issue discuss the importance of developing methods for discovering rare patterns in text, introduce a graph-based approach for text representation and present an error tolerance dissimilarity algorithm for deviation detection. Their approach is based on the use of conceptual graphs where they evaluate their algorithm in the context of analyzing real-world fi nancial statements for identifying deviating performance indicators. Their results demonstrate that their proposed approach can successfully identify deviating sentences where experts validate the correctness of the discoveries. And fi nally the last article by Furletti and Turini is about knowledge discovery in ontologies. Discussing how ontologies allow one to represent knowledge and data in implicit and explicit way, the authors introduce a novel approach for extracting implicit knowledge from ontologies. In their approach the implicit knowledge is extracted in the form of in fl uence rules and this is a general concept that is applicable to many domains. Their case study, which is based on an intrusion detection application, shows that the in fl uence rules can be used to integrate existing knowledge or to support the data mining process.

In conclusion, with this third issue of Volume 16 of the IDA journal, we continue our efforts on organizing and publishing a high quality journal in this community. The next IDA conference that is usually organized in Europe, will be held in Helsinki, Finland on October 25 X 27, 2012. For details please refer to http ://ida 2012.org/. We look forward to receiving your feedback along with more and more quality articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the fi eld of IDA. With our best wishes,
 Dear Colleague: Welcome to volume 16(4) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal
This issue of the IDA journal consists of nine articles which represent a variety of topics, all related to the applied and theoretical research in the fi eld of Intelligent Data Analysis.

The fi rst two articles are about feature selection. Ghodrati and Kasaei in the fi rst article of this issue discuss the topic of feature weighting and propose two methods that are applicable for a better discrimination of similar actions in human action categorizations. A new feature discrimination power is de fi ned by the authors that is used in the feature selection process. The experiments presented in this article demonstrate how their proposed methods improve the categorization accuracy using two well-known data sets. Brown et al. in the second article discuss the dif fi culty for understanding the information stored for feature space and present an ef fi cient method for searching the feature space of a polynomial support vector machine. The time complexity of this method is based on the number of variables, the degree of kernel, the number of support vectors and the number of features that the algorithm is allowed to search. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in identifying the top weighted features in a number of simulated as well as high-dimensional real data sets.
The next four articles are about learning and classi fi cation. Hamrouni discusses the importance of dis-covering really useful patterns, such as associations, from large data sets and emphasizes the importance of these discoveries from an end-user point of view. This article is about the exact representation of frequent patterns and the relationships between these patterns and minimum description length principle. The article is also about classi fi cation of concise representation of frequent itemsets according to their common characteristics and contains a case study of these representations with emphasis on closed sets. Fakhrahamd et al. in the fourth article of this issue argue the topic of world sense disambiguation and propose a fuzzy classi fi cation system for this purpose. Their approach is based on a rule-weight mechanism that is used to tune the classi fi er and propose a new learning method to iteratively adjust the weight of fuzzy rules. Their proposed scheme shows a uniformly good behavior and where results are comparable or better than other classi fi cation systems. Franco-Arcega et al. in the fi fth article discuss the limitations of classi fi cation algorithms to properly handle large data sets and propose a new fast heuristic for building decision trees from large training sets. This approach overcomes the limitations of some of the existing algorithms using all instances of the training set without storing all of them in memory. Their experimental results show the better performance of this algorithm for building decision trees from large data sets. Berka in the next article de fi nes different approaches that are common for learning and presenting decision rules and argues that the most common approach is set-covering approach which is also called separate and conquer. The author presents an algorithm called KEX, which is in fact the LISP Miner system and demonstrates results of a rule learning approach that is implemented in the WEKA system.

Podlasov et al. in the seventh article of this issue discuss multi-modal analysis of heterogeneous resources in modern media and propose an approach that takes time-stamped annotations into a state-transition diagram. The authors show how the resulting state-transition diagram can be visualized using the most common visualization tools. Their case study is based on the use of their visualization tool to assist media researchers in detecting patterns in multimodal analysis of news videos. Guerra et al. report on the comparison of cluster quality indices and their performance under different data characteristic conditions. Their case studies involve evaluation of standard indices using a set of parameters such as different clustering methods where the results of ranking all indices are compared. And fi nally, Apiletti et al. in the last article of this issue which is an applied research article discuss feature selection in high dimensional biologi cal data and present a method that is inte nded to measure the ab ility of each attribute (e.g. gene) for classi fi cation of each sample and rank attributes by computing an overlap score. Their experimental results show that their proposed approach results in higher classi fi cation accuracy in terms of a wide range of feature selection applications.

In conclusion, with Volume 16 of the IDA journa l, we continue receivi ng more and more quality papers submitted to the IDA journal for evaluation. We have also been approached for special issues to be produced from the best papers of related conferences and workshops. This year, we will be working on two special issues. The IDA conference that is usually organized in Europe, will be held in Helsinki, Finland from October 25 X 27, 2012. For details pleas e refer to http://ida2012. org/. We look forward to receiving your fee dback along with more and m ore quality articles in bot h applied and theoretical research related to the fi eld of IDA.
 With our best wishes,
 Dear Colleague: Welcome to volume 16(6) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal
This issue of the IDA journal consists of nine articles which represent a variety of topics, all related to the applied and theoretical research in the fi eld of Intelligent Data Analysis.

The fi rst three articles are about data understanding and data preprocessing. Abell X n and Moral in the fi rst article discuss the issue of attribute dependency and introduce a method to identify when two cat-egorical variables are independent. They compare their method with different scores such as Bayesian metric, Bayesian information criterion, the p-value of the Chi-square test, where the results are shown to be more suitable for certain type of problems. Nikoli  X  c X  X  article is about measuring similarity of graph nodes where a method is proposed to perform sorting based on re fi ned concept of node similarity through matching neighbors. The experimental results show the convergence of this approach where it is evalu-ated on several problems and its comparison to other methods. Makarehchi and Kamel in the next article of this issue discuss the lack of robustness in feature ranking of text when it is used in different data sets. They introduce a new method that is based on combining feature rankings and selection of the best features. They apply their proposed method in text classi fi cation problems and evaluate it on three well-known data sets using support vector machines and Rocchio classi fi er. They show that combining methods can offer reliable results.

The next two articles are mostly on classi fi cation. Li et al. in the fourth article argue that SVM X  X  that are highly accurate classi fi ers, are not easy to use in large data sets because of their training complexity. They propose a new approach to SVM that relies on a two stage process that consists of a random se-lection to select a small group of training data followed by a de-clustering technique to recover training data for a second stage SVM. From their experimental results on several data sets the distinctive ad-vantage of their approach on analyzing large data sets is shown. Sameon et al. in the next article argue that conventional threshold selection in Boolean reasoning based discretization produces unacceptable results and propose a solution that includes particle swarm optimization. They argue that the fi rst task is to reduce the search space and the second task is to reconstruct the fi tness function. Their results of experimentation using four real data sets show how their approach outperforms the existing discretizers in terms of classi fi cation accuracy as well as reduction of the decision rules.

Frequent item sets is the topic of the next two articles. Rajalaxmi and Natarajan in the sixth article of this issue discuss privacy preserving data mining and propose an approach that consists of hiding sensitive utility and frequent itemset s and it contains minimum impact on the non-sensitive information. Results of their evaluation on synthetic and real data sets show the effectiveness of their approach in minimizing the non-sensitive itemsets as well as m aintaining data quality in the sanitized database. Nguyen and Yamamoto in the next article propose an incremental mining algorithm for closed frequent labeled ordered trees. This is based on the adaptation of a divide-and-conquer strategy where different data mining strategies are applied at different stages of the data mining process. Their experiments demonstrate the ef fi ciency and scalability of their algorithm on both synthetic and real data sets.
The last two articles are more along the line of benchmarking and applied research. Sun and Garibaldi argue that parametric and non-parametric approaches are suitable for model selection and discuss robust clustering where they use student t-distribution as the building block. They introduce two clustering algorithms where one is based on student t-distribution and the other with Dirichlet Process mixture. They compare the new algorithms on a set of UCI data sets where their experimental results show the advantages of their proposed met hods on identifying outliers. Rasheed and Alhajj in the last article of this issue discuss the importance of fi nding periodic patterns in large data sets and analyze a set of stock market data in detail. They demonstrate how the periodic pattern analysis may help in better understanding of the data to predict the future trends. Their experimental results show that taking into account missing values may result in identifying more interesting patterns in the data.

In conclusion, with the completion of Volume 16 of the IDA journal, we continue receiving more and more quality papers submitted to the IDA journal for evaluation and publication. Over the next year, we will have 1 X 2 special issues to be produced from the best papers of related conferences and workshops. The IDA conference that is usually organized in Europe, was would be held in Helsinki, Finland from October 25 X 27, 2012. We will provide some details in the next issue of the IDA journal. We look forward to receiving your f eedback along with more and more quality articles i n both applied and theoretical research related to the fi eld of IDA.
 With our best wishes,
 Dear Colleague: Welcome to volume 17(2) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal.

This issue of the IDA journal consists of ten articles which represent a variety of topics, all related to the applied and theoretical research in the field of Intelligent Data Analysis.

The first three articles of this issue are about similarity and association. Khosravi-Farasani et al. in the first article discuss similarity estimation and propose a new perspective on specifying the similarity between resources in linked data and in particular for a directed and attributed graph. The idea is to use combination of structural properties of a graph and attribute value of vertices. Their suggested model is evaluated in a clustering procedure using some standard data sets where class label of each resource is estimated and compared with the ground-truth class label. Their experimental results show that their model outperforms other clustering algorithms in terms of precision and recall. The second article of this issue by Jamin X z et al. is about the study of association rules within a group of individuals. The authors define group association rules where they identify the interestingness measures for them. These measures are then used to rank not only groups of individuals but also rules within each group. The proposed approach is evaluated on a number of well-known data sets. Zare et al. in the third article of this issue discuss the drawback of computing an exact measure of betweenness centrality in high dimensional data. They apply a random projection approach and propose an approximation algorithm that is suitable for weighted and unweighted graphs. Their proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of single-source shortest path computations. The results of their evaluation on a number of real-world networks and synthetic bench marks show interesting results based on some statistical evaluation measures.

The next two articles are mostly on classification and supervised learning. Wang proposes a nonpara-metric bivariate copula estimation method which is based on smoothing empirical copula with shape restricted least squares support vector regression. The proposed approach exploits a priori shape of cop-ula function. The experiments presented in the article that are based on artificial and financial time-series data, clearly show that the approach can achieve significantly better performance than parametric meth-ods and kernel smoother. Hassanzadeh and Kevanpour in the fifth article of this article discuss the topic of sequence labeling and propose using active learning and semi-supervised learning for sequence label-ing. It seems that their proposed approach could significantly reduce manual annotation costs (  X  90%) compared with supervised learning that is estimated at 30%. The particular model selected here is con-ditional random field which has shown promising performance in several sequence labeling tasks.
This issue also includes four applied research articles. Shankar and Purusothaman discuss the concept of utility based data mining and argue that when data mining is employed in stock market prediction, it would devise association rules that would lead to high return in investment. The authors propose a new analysis methodology which is based on the concept of utility based data mining where it generates utility emphasized trading rules. The article includes experiments where the proficiency of the obtained rules is compared against the conventional utility-emphasized and frequency-based trading rules using a set of related values. Mazloomian and Beigy discuss the concept of nested effects model and propose two methods for inferring signaling pathways from interventional data. Their first method consists of a search in all feasible solutions to maximize a Bayesian score and their second method sub-models are constructed with informative features. The two methods proposed here are evaluated in various noise lev-els on real and artificial networks with different sizes. Their results show that the networks constructed using their approach comes with a higher level of accuracy compared to networks inferred from com-paring methods. Swapna et al. in the next article of this issue discuss use of heart rate variability (HRV) signals obtained from ECG data for better diagnosis of diabetes. Their approach is based on extracting features from HRV, linearizing them for their studies and subsequently applying several classification methods to better identify normal and diabetic subjects. The novel approach proposed here demon-strates the ability to detect diabetes efficiently by analyzing subtle changes in ECG signals. Karunaratne et al. in the last article of this group discuss the topic of quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling which consists of two steps: descriptor discovery and model building. The particular domain and problem presented in this article is chemoinformatics. The authors show a comparative analysis of chemoinformatics-based and structure-based approaches where in their experiments they demonstrate that one of the chemo-informatics based approaches results in significantly more accurate models com-pared to all other methods investigated. Results from combining descriptor sets are also presented in this article.

And finally, in the last article of this issue, Bellodi and Riguzzi present a machine learning technique targeted to probabilistic logic programs, its associ ated languages, and propose a technique for learning parameters for these languages. They adopt an expectation maximization algorithm which is evaluated on a number of well-known bench mark data sets with some interesting results included in the article.
In conclusion, with this issue of the IDA journal which is Volume 17(2), we are observing a sharp increase in submission of manuscripts to our journal for evaluation and publication. We continue our efforts to select the highest quality papers. We have also learned that the IDA-2013 Symposium will be held in London, UK from October 17 X 19. The deadline for submission of papers is May 6, 2013. For more information please refer to http://sites.brunel.ac.uk/ida2013. We look forward to receiving your feedback along with more and more quality articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the field of IDA.
 With our best wishes,
 Dear Colleague Welcome to volume 17(3) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal.

This issue of the IDA journal consists of nine articles which represent a variety of topics, all related to the applied and theoretical research in the field of Intelligent Data Analysis.

The first three articles of this issue are about semi-supervised learning methods. Imani and Keyvanpour in the first article of this issue discuss the difficulty in text categorization where a small number of examples are available and what role semi-supervised learning methods can play. They propose use of self-learning as a solution to this class of problems and apply dynamic weighting combined with majority voting approach to analyse un-labeled data. They used their proposed method on real world data sets where their experiments indicate performance improvements in classification. Choi et al. in the next article of this issue discuss the difficulty in validation of discovered models when a small number of labeled examples are available from which a subset has to be used for validation. They propose to use ensemble learning and graph sharpening to circumvent this problem. Their experimental results demonstrate the applicability of their method in real world situations where best parameter values are identified. Sugiyama and Yamamoto in the last article of this group propose a new approach for semi-supervised learning that is based on closed set lattices. They present a learning algorithm which performs as multi-class classifier and a label ranker for mix ed data that contains bot h discrete and continuous variables. Their proposed algorithm uses both labeled and unlabeled data to construct a closed set lattice. Their experiments show the competitive performance of their algorithm in classification and ranking compared to other learning algorithms.

Chen et al. in the fourth article of this issue discuss the problem of skewed class distribution and costs associated with non-uniform misclassification. They investigate the effects of cost ratio, imbalance ratio and sample size on classification performance using some real-world data sets. They further demon-strate that cost ratio and level of class imbalance have strong effects on prediction performance and mostly recommend near balanced training data sets to be used. Albertini and de Mello discuss the main complexity in analyzing data streams where clustering is applied dynamically to understand and repre-sent data behavior changes. They emphasize the limitations of the above process and propose an on-line and adaptive approach to monitor and react to behavior changes. Their proposed approach that is based on k -means is experimentally evaluated and behavior changes are verified by testing the isomorphism of Markov chains over time.

This issue also includes four reviews and applied research articles. Khatoon et al. in the sixth article emphasize the importance of mining software source code for identifying useful patterns and provide a survey of tools and techniques which are based on data mining approaches. Their article provides a comparison and evaluation of some current code mining tools and techniques and presents a concise overview of source code mining techniques. Their results show that existing techniques are primarily targeting bug detection and among some of the areas where they identify a need is tools to develop quality software by automatically detecting different bugs. Cov X es et al. in the next article compare a number of clustering algorithms that are suitable to work with constraints. Their studies presented in the article include using 20 data sets where for each of them they experiment over 800 constraints. In order to provide some confidence on the randomness of their results, they provide a number of statistical significance of their results. They also present the robustness and computational complexity of their algorithms in terms of handling noisy constraints and a number of new experimental findings. Mallick et al. report on their investigation of the need for incremental mining of sequential patterns and present an analytical study focusing on the characteristics of 20 incremental learning algorithms. Overall, they conclude that the best performance can be achieved in progressive databases. And finally, Majnik and Bosni  X  c in the last article of this issue discuss extensive use of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves in machine learning and present a survey of this field where they present a condense report containing important achievements. They present application areas of the ROC analysis in machine learning and describe a number of problems and challenges. They also provide a couple of examples to illustrate some of the existing applications.

In conclusion, with this issue of the IDA journal which is Volume 17(3), we are observing a steady increase in submission of manuscripts to our journal for evaluation and publication. We continue our efforts to select the highest quality papers. In addition, this year X  X  Intelligent Data Analysis Symposium (IDA-2013) will be held in London, UK from October 17 X 19. The deadline for submission of papers is May 6, 2013. For more information please refer to http://sites.brunel.ac.uk/ida2013. We look forward to receiving your feedback along with more and more quality articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the field of IDA.

 Dear Colleague Welcome to volume 17(4) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal.

This issue of the IDA journal consists of nine articles which represent a variety of topics, all related to the applied and theoretical research in the field of Intelligent Data Analysis.

The first article of this issue by Peres and Olague is on genetic programing applied to object recog-nition. The authors propose a new approach for learning operators through genetic programming. Their approach that relies on synthesis of mathematical expressions extracts information derived from objects such as images. Their experimental results confirm the validity of their approach using a series of tests where their results are compared with a number of test beds. The second article of this issue by Feng et al is about mining high utility itemsets from data streams. Knowing that time and space are quite essential in analyzing this class of data, the authors propose a new data structure for maintaining utility informa-tion of transaction itemsets which is based on a sliding window. As a result, searching for patterns in high utility item sets can be done with an efficient sca nning of the database. Their experimental results show that their algorithm has better performance in terms of stability and other performance parameters. Al Shaqsi and Wang in the third article of this issue discuss the topic of cluster estimation in unsuper-vised learning. They propose a new method for estimating the most probable number of clusters. Their approach is based on calculating the length of a constant similarity interval where they use the longest length as the most probable number of clusters. Their experimental results on three synthetic and eight real data sets and its comparison with some well-known methods show that their approach performs significantly better.

Cagliero and Fiori present a framework that entails the discovery of hidden and high-level correlations, in the form of generalized association rules, among the content and contextual features of social media contents. Unlike traditional data mining approaches, their proposed approach takes into account the evolution of extracted patterns across the sequence of the previous mining sessions. Their experiments performed on both real and synthetic data show the effectiveness and the efficiency of their approach. Xie et al. in the fifth article of this issue discuss challenges in multi-category classification problems and propose an approach called one-versus-all twin support vector machine classification for multi-category classification problems. The idea is to use a one-versus-all approach to construct a twin support vector machine classifier. The evaluation of their work reported in the article includes use of synthetic and real data sets where both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that their approach outperforms traditional classifiers.

Lee and Giraud-Carrier in the sixth article of this issue address the key topic of automatically choosing learning algorithms for data mining applications. They propose a two-step approach in which one first clusters learning algorithms based on behaviour similarity and then redefines meta-learning process as mapping classification tasks to clusters of behaviorally-similar algorithms. Their experiments on a wide variety of classification tasks reported in the paper demonstrate better results than typical selection mod-els. The next article by Rui and Yang propose a smooth support vector learning algorithm suitable for fuzzy rule-based classification systems. The proposed algorithm is capable of generating non-linear sep-arating surfaces using arbitrary kernels where a fuzzy classifier using arbitrary reference functions can be built from training samples. The performance of their proposed algorithm using different reference function is shown in their experimental results.

Finally, the last two articles of this issue are on applied research. Hatami and Chira discuss the chal-lenging task of feature selection in analyzing microarray gene expression data and propose a random subspace ensemble-based method targeting microarray data in life sciences. Their approach is based on using multiple classifiers that use randomly selected features from a given training data. Experimental re-sults of their study show the use of their approach for analyzing some publicly available gene expression data related to cancer where the proposed method is competitive with related models from the literature. The last article if this issue, by Shin and Park is also about feature identification. The authors discuss the issue in the domain of search engines where they emphasize that the existing relevance assessment approaches applied in web page retrieval sometimes produce unsatisfactory results due to changes in their input. The authors therefore suggest to identify significant features from input data elements with the aim of improving the effectiveness of input retrieval while at the same time reducing computational costs. The author report a set of experiments conducted using real-world data sets where they produced interesting results.

In conclusion, with this issue of the IDA journal which is Volume 17(4), we are glad to report contin-uous increase in submission of manuscripts to our journal for evaluation and publication. We continue our efforts to select the highest quality papers. In addition, this year X  X  Intelligent Data Analysis Sympo-sium (IDA-2013) will be held in London, UK from October 17 X 19. For more information please refer to http://site s.brunel.ac.uk/ida2013. We look forward to r eceiving your feedback along with more and more quality articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the field of IDA.

 Dear colleague Welcome to volume 17(5) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal.

This issue of the IDA journal consists of nine articles which represent many aspects of theoretical and applied research, all related to the field of Intelligent Data Analysis.

The first article of this issue by Matarese et al. discusses the importance of data preprocessing. They argue that in a typical data analysis example, when the aim of a system trained through a supervised learning procedure is to approximate an existing functional relationship between input and output vari-ables, the database that is used in the training phase should not contain input-out patterns for which there is inconsistency. They propose a procedure for detecting non-coherent associations between input and output patterns through comparison of two distance metrics. The efficiency of their approach is pre-sented in their article. Sokolova and Fernandez-Caballero in the second article of this issue introduce an approach to study complex systems and introduce an approach for mining and simulating data in this class of environments. Their proposed framework consists of three phases which consist of prelimi-nary domain and system analysis, system design and coding and finally simulation and decision making. Their experiments to evaluate their proposed approach are fairly elaborate and they cover a wide range of issues in dealing with complex information systems. Arenas et al. in the next article of this issue argue the influence of parameters and selection of the most relevant ones on the behavior and performance of search algorithms. They propose a method that is essentially based on ANOVA. Their proposed method is evaluated in an exhaustive analysis of an evolutionary algorithm where the authors verify the adequacy of parameter values in their experiments.

Robnik-Sikonja et al. in the next article of this issue discuss the role of probabilistic radial basis function network being an important form of classification. They demonstrate a method that is a variation of a one-variable-at-a-time and all subsets explanation and apply it for their experiments. For evaluation they use several artificial and real data sets where they demonstrate the usefulness of their proposed approach. Wang and Song in the fifth article of this issue discuss feature selection in data analysis and propose an algorithm that mines association rules from a given data set, identifies relevant and interactive features values, and detects and eliminates redundant features. The effectiveness of their algorithm is tested on both synthetic and real data sets where the results show that their algorithm outperforms other feature selection algorithms in terms of classification accuracy. The next article of this issue by Mottin et al. is also on feature selection. The authors study how the log information can be analyzed in order to improve the ranking of the results returned by an entity search engine. They present a novel framework for feature extraction that is based on the notions of entity matching and attribute frequencies where the extracted features are used to train a ranking classifier. Their experiments also show their algorithm performs better in terms of accuracy.

Gomez and Vaisman in the seventh article of this issue discuss mining data from semantic trajectories that are along the line of moving objects. They present a language that is based on regular expressions over constraints where sequential patterns can be expressed. The authors also introduce a data mining algorithm that is based on sequential pattern mining and evaluate the performance of this algorithm on a case study where the main variables that impact the algorithm are investigated and the results are shown. Finally, the last two articles of this issue are on mining frequent patterns, mostly from customer data. Huang et al. discuss the patterns in customer data when customer interests change. They propose a sequential pattern mining algorithm that incorporates the concepts of frequency, recency and profit to discover frequent, recent and profitable sequential patterns. Their algorithm that is incorporated into a recommender system is evaluated using a real customer data where the results are shown better perfor-mance of this proposed recommender comparing some exiting ones. The last article by Yun et al. is also on pattern mining where the authors propose two mining algorithms that are suitable for mining compact and meaningful set of frequent patterns. The two algorithms are evaluated in this article where the authors show the efficiency and scalability of their algorithms.

In conclusion, with this issue of the IDA journal which is Volume 17(5), we are glad to report contin-uous increase in submission of manuscripts to our journal for evaluation and publication. We continue our efforts to select the highest quality papers. In addition, this year X  X  Intelligent Data Analysis Sympo-sium (IDA-2013) will be held in London, UK from October 17 X 19. For more information please refer to http://site s.brunel.ac.uk/ida2013. We look forward to r eceiving your feedback along with more and more quality articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the field of IDA.
 Dear Colleague: Welcome to volume 17(6) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal.

This issue of the IDA journal, the last one for Volume 17, which is our 2013 publication, consists of ten articles, all representing different aspects of theoretical and applied research related to the field of Intelligent Data Analysis.

The first article of this issue by Ordonez and Chen is about discovering frequent pattern pairs. The authors introduce the idea of cube pairs, which are pattern pair generalization of cubes and associa-tion rules. They introduce an algorithmic optimization approach to discover comparable pattern sets and compare a number of related methods. They approach includes a reliability metric that is based on cross-validation. The authors present an extensive experimental evaluation of their approach with a number of real data sets and show that cube pairs produce more reliable results than rule pairs. In the second article of this issue, Vimal-Kumar and Tamilarasi propose an optimization based algorithm for rule mining of multi-relational data that is based on an adapted genetic algorithm approach. The rule optimization is done through filtering the fitness function of the genetic algorithm in relation with the multi relational data mining algorithm. Their experimental results show that their proposed approach has a much better efficiency. Haghighi and Rahmati in the third article of this issue discuss the idea of mapping to multidi-mensional optimal region as a proposed method for multiclass classification tasks. Their theoretical and experimental results show the advantages of this approach in terms of computational complexity and is comparable to several methods and complementary to others such as Vapnik-Chervonenkis growth function.

Mutual information evaluation and feature weighting is the subject of the next article by Ji et al .The authors discuss the important topic of feature weighting and propose using mutual information to predict the performance of feature weighting through measuring gain in mutual information. Their experimental results show that the mutual information evaluation reduces the running time without sacrificing the quality of clustering, a common approach in feature weighting. In a similar research by Perlata et al. ,the authors discuss the process of supervised clustering and present Labeled K-Means, an algorithm suitable clustering labeled data. The authors evaluate the performance of their proposed algorithm using a set of standard real data sets and also compare their approach with standard K-Means. Their experiments show that in most cases the proposed clustering approach outperforms alternative techniques by a considerable margin.

Won-On in the sixth article of this issue discusses the importance of mining interaction behaviours of actors in social networks and identify two interaction behaviours, namely engagingness and responsive-ness. The study presented in this article involves use of Enron email data set to perform some preprocess-ing and establishing some links between e-mails and their replies. The study also includes quantitative behavior models for systematically measuring users X  engagingness and responsiveness and also a graph visualization technique to visualize information exchange networks by means of behaviours and com-munity structures. Wang et al. in the next article present a novel cluster analysis approach that is based on time-series structure and is intended to identify similar motions in analyzing human motion data. In their approach, to cluster sequences, the authors transform the movement sequences from time-series video into low-dimensional multivariate time series and later convert them into vectors based on their structure in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. The article includes application of various clustering algorithms to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed approach on some real data sets. In the next article which is along the same line of research, Shamsinejadbabaki et al. discuss the applicability and post-processing of discovered models which is the core of action mining. The authors introduce a novel approach suitable for action mining that explicitly relies on an automatically obtained best estimate of the causal relationships in a given data set. Evaluation of their approach is also presented in their article.
The last two articles of this issue are more on applied research. Wu and Huang discuss some of the challenges in efficient recommender systems and propose a genre-based fuzzy inference filtering ap-proach for predicting movie preferences. Their approach is based on using content-based and collabora-tive filtering algorithms as baseline methods to evaluate the performance of their proposed approach. The results of their experiments demonstrate that the hybrid approach exploits the strengths of the content-based and collaborative filtering algorithms to achieve filtering in terms of precision. In the last article of this issue, Twala discusses the effects of noise and low quality data in machine learning and presents an investigation of five machine learning algorithms in terms robustness in credit-risk applications. In particular, the author shows that when noise (class or attribute) is added to a given data set, the noise in the class variable is the one that is primarily responsible for poor predictive accuracy.

In conclusion, with this issue of the IDA journal which is Volume 17(6), we are glad to report continu-ous increase in submission of manuscripts to our journal for evaluation and publication and also requests for special issues. A special issue in planning is in the area of Business Analytics in Finance and Industry. The deadline for submission of papers for this special issue is March 15, 2014 (please see call for papers included in this issue of IDA journal). Interested authors can contact Prof. Richard Weber, Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad de Chile (rweber@dii.uchile.cl). We look forward to receiving your feedback along with more and more quality articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the field of IDA.

 Dear Colleague: Welcome to volume 18(2) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal.

This issue of the IDA journal consists of ten articles, all representing various aspects of theoretical and applied research and development related to the field of Intelligent Data Analysis.

In the first article of this issue Chen discusses the concept of interactive visual cluster analysis and presents a study of star-coordinate based visualization models. The article proposes an optimized design that provides the most efficient approach to an interactive model visualization and validation. The ar-ticle contains a set of experimental evaluation and demonstrates how such an approach could generate effective visualization along with minimizing the computational costs. Mishra et al . in the second article of this issue discuss clustering from a different perspective. The authors present an approach to web user clustering in which they integrate set and sequence similarity measures with a rough set algorithm. Their application and case study involves using a well-known news data set in which the authors present the quality of their clusters with a number of clustering algorithms in DBSCAN. Rouigeb et al .inthe next article of this issue propose a semi-non-parametric density estimation framework for analyzing high-dimensional data. Their approach is based on development of a generic framework that consists of three modules, a Bayesian Network learning module, a fuzzy clustering module and an Independent Component Analysis module. The approach is evaluated in a supervised classification problem.
Vallim et al . in the fourth article of this issue discuss the importance of change detection in data streams and propose a framework for an unsupervised and automatic change detection in data streams. The proposed framework consists of a density based clustering step followed by a novelty detection procedure that is based on entropy. This article reports on the performance of their proposed approach in a set of experiments where insights into how to design change detection in data streams are obtained. Yu et al . in the next article advocate that all imbalanced data analysis cases may not necessarily be harmful and propose an approach to pre-estimate the level of harmfulness, given a particular data imbalance situation. The article includes studies about the reasons for harmfulness due to class imbalance and propose a simple and ingenious strategy that involves using matrix based class separability to estimate the level of harmfulness due to class imbalance. The results show that under certain circumstances, a-priori information could guide us to achieve better results.

The sixth article of this issue by Kittiphattanabawon et al . is about association rule mining where the authors present a region-based method to selectively use different association measures to rank different regions in the data. For example, focusing on news relations, judged by the domain expert, it would be completely related, somehow related and unrelated. The approach presented in this article has been extensively evaluated using large amounts of news data where the results showed substantial advantage. The seventh article of this issue is also on association rule mining where Koh and Pears argue that most association rule mining methods only consider positive frequent item sets. They propose a complemen-tary approach that also looks for negative association rules and in their search they only consider the presence or absence of itemsets that are strongly associated. Their proposed approach is compared with other methods where they demonstrate that their approach is able to generate set of rules which are more interesting.
Lee and Giraud-Carrier in the next article of this issue demonstrate the risk associated with using default implementations of learning algorithms, without knowing the consequences.Their study includes an implementation of a radial basis function and its integration with three data mining software packages where they show that the proposed approach performs like Na X ve Bayes in most instances. With the experiments performed, the authors argue that their proposed approach can influence computational complexity, ensemble design and metalearning for algorithm selection. The article by Iqbal et al .isalso about association rule mining with Bayesian networks in XML data. In this article the authors propose a model for identifying sensitive items related to sensitive XML association rules. The approach is based on using a combination of a Bayesian network-based measures along with a K2 algorithm that is used to generate Bayesian networks. Their proposed model is tested and compared in several case studies presented in their article where they demonstrate that their approach reduces the risks involved in XML association rule mining. The last article of this issue by Morales et al . is an application on satellite image analysis where the authors propose a novel method to identify transition regions in the same way that they are found in nature. Their experimental results presented in the paper demonstrates that their approach outperforms some commercial software.

In conclusion, with this issue of the IDA journal, which is Volume 18(2), we are glad to report continu-ous increase in submission of manuscripts to our journal for evaluation and publication and also requests for special issues. A special issue in planning is in the area of Business Analytics in Finance and Indus-try. The deadline for submission of papers for this special issue is March 15, 2014 (please see call for papers included in this issue of the IDA journal). Interested authors can contact Prof. Richard Weber, Department of Industrial Engineering, Universidad de Chile (rweber@dii.uchile.cl). We look forward to receiving your feedback along with more and more quality articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the field of IDA.

 Dear Colleague: Welcome to volume 18(3) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal.

This issue of the IDA journal consists of eleven articles, all related to various aspects of theoretical and applied research and development related to the field of Intelligent Data Analysis.

In the first article of this issue Pichara and Soto highlight some shortcomings of feature selection methods and suggest to adaptively find a local subset of features for each data instance so that classi-fication of each instance is performed according to its own selective subset. Their proposed approach is based on Gaussian processes which improves classification performance by learning a set of features that quantify the discriminative power of each feature. Their experimental results show that by using local discriminative subspaces one can achieve a higher level of classification accuracy. Do, Song and Jia in the second article of this issue discuss challenges in detecting concept drift and propose a method that applies entropy over an adaptive sliding window. In their approach the sliding window is not fixed but dynamically determined. Their approach also integrates an algorithm to find the exact timestamp for retraining the classifier whenever a concept drift is detected. Their experimental results show that com-paring to four benchmarks, their proposed method is better than or comparable to others. The next article by Padrol and Muntes-Mulero is a bout graph anonymization. They emphasize the importance of this topic and suggest that classical anonymization techniques could be used in this case. They propose to embed a graph into a multidimensional vector space that approximately preserves the distance between any two vertices in a typical graph. Their experiments show that they can successfully anonymize graphs using most common techniques.

The next two articles are about clustering. Alizadeh et al. discuss the issue of cluster stability and explain the drawbacks of some of the most common approaches used in cluster quality. They propose a new asymptotic criterion to assess the association between a cluster and a set of partitionings. They also propose a clustering ensemble framework that incorporates their criterion in order to find the best performing clusters. Their empirical studies show that their proposed approach outperforms several other ensemble approaches. Ben Hariz and Elouedi in the fifth article of this issue explain dynamic clustering and propose a new dynamic clustering approach that is based on k-means. In this approach, using cluster cohesion and separation concepts, the algorithm updates cluster partitions. Their experiments on several benchmark data sets show that their approach outperforms static approaches.
 Nearest neighbor method is the subject of the next two articles. Zhai et al. discuss the limitations of K-NN and Fuzzy K-NN and propose two condensed fuzzy nearest neighbor methods that each consist of three steps. The proposed steps in their methods are: obtaining a fuzzy attribute reduct, finding sets of prototypes, and extracting fuzzy classification rules. Their experimental results and the statistical analysis of the results show that their proposed methods outperform other methods compared in their study. Zhang and Song highlight the main limitation of K-NN where there is no symmetrical solution to determine the specific value of K. In order to address this problem the authors propose a novel method of using back propagation neural networks to explore the relationship between data set characteristics and the optimal values of K. Their experimental results reported in the article show that compared with the recommended K values, the required time for determining the K values is substantially decreased.
The last four articles of this issue are mostly on applied research. Nickaein et al. introduce a novel approach to apply support vector regression for rate prediction in distributed video coding. The authors introduce a new method for bitrate estimation using  X  -SVM regression with the aid of a novel set of features. Their approach also includes a hybrid coding mode which reduces the computational complex-ity in a conventional Stanford codec. They evaluate their method using three different video sequences. Their simulation results for the feedback-free method show that the average decrease in the decoded frames is reasonably low. Burton et al. in the next article discuss a novel mining technique for analysis of questionnaire data. They argue th at traditional association rule min ing algorithms only produce obvi-ous rules from questions data. The authors propose an enhancement to association rule mining that uses clustering to identify related questions to pre-prune rules involving similar questions. Their proposed approach reduces the search space of rules which in turn results in improving the algorithm X  X  efficiency. They demonstrate this improvement through analyzing two real-world data sets. Guopeng et al. in the tenth article of this issue discuss the importance of community discovery in social network data and propose extensions to nonnegative matrix factorization method where they use diagonally dominant ma-trix as constraint condition to obtain the community membership as well as the interaction information among communities. Their experiments demonstrate the meaningful results produced which also con-tain additional information about node characteristics. And finally, Rahie and Beigy in the last article of this issue discuss the importance of credit assignment in artificial intelligence and consider use of re-inforcement learning as a possible solution. They define a framework called expertness framework and use it in a multi-agent credit assignment problem. I n their proposed approach the critic agent, respon-sible for distributing credit among agents, is equipped with learning capability, and the proposed credit assignment solution is based on the critic to learn to assign a proportion of the credit to each agent. Their experimental results show the superiority of their method over several methods of credit assignment used in other domains.

In conclusion, with this issue of the IDA journal, which is Volume 18(3), we are glad to report con-tinuous increase in submission of manuscripts to our journal. Preparation of two special issues of the IDA journal is in progress. In addition, this year X  X  IDA symposium will be held from October 30 th to November 1 st , in Leuven, Belgium (http://www.ida2014.org/). We look forward to receiving your feed-back along with more and more quality articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the field of IDA.

 Dear Colleague: Welcome to volume 18(4) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal.

This issue of the IDA journal consists of eleven articles, all covering various topics related to the theoretical and applied research in the field of Intelligent Data Analysis.
 The first 4 articles of this issue are about clustering and unsupervised learning. In the first article, Novoselova discusses the cluster stability issue a nd propose a stability-based algorithm to estimate the individual clusters of the dendogram. The proposed algorithm is based on a repetitive construction of the hierarchy of clusters followed by the calculation of the original consensus matrix. The experiments reported in this article on two simulated data sets and additional comparative analysis on real data sets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. Vahidipour et al. in the second article of this issue also discuss hierarchical clustering and consider using multiple methods to generate a set of dendograms. The authors compare several weighted combination methods where they use hierarchical clustering re-sults to derive a consensus. Their results show that weighting combination of hierarchical clustering performs better than averaging. Hu et al. in the third article describe a framework for cluster improve-ments which involves user supervision at the feature level. The proposed method ranks all features based on the recent clusters using cluster based feature selection and presents a list of highly ranked features to the user for labeling. Their experimental results on several real data sets demonstrate the feature set obtained using the new interactive framework that can produce clusters that better match the user X  X  ex-pectations compared with unsupervised approach. Ebrahimi and Abdollahi in the fourth article of this group focus on privacy preserving clustering (PPC) and argue that most of the existing techniques are based on heuristic notions. They propose an -differential based algorithm to generate a perturbed data for PPC and use a wavelet transform approach for reduced number of dimensions and less noise in the data. In their experiments reported in this article they compare their approach with other algorithms based on utility and privacy guarantees.

The next three articles are on temporal data and frequent patterns. Dey et al. in the fifth article of this issue discuss the topic of neighborhood discovery and describe four algorithms that are appropriate for knowledge discovery in temporal data. Their approach is based on identifying temporal neighbor-hoods with distinct demarcations that are based on unequal depth discretization of the data. The article contains results on both synthetic and real data sets. The next article by Shaw and Gopalan is about dis-covering meaningful trajectories from dynamic objects. The idea proposed by the authors is to apply the association-based mining concepts in order to find the longest trajectories from the frequent trajectory patterns. The path in this case is derived by applying the modified apriori where frequent pattern tree methods are compared with a standard graph based methods. The approach given in this paper is also applicable to game theory. The seventh article of this issue by Liu is also on mining frequent patterns, and in this case is on uncertain univariate class of data. This is a class of data where attributes in the transactions are associated with a quantitative interval and a probability density function that assigns a probability to each value in the interval. The author proposes th ree algorithms that a re different in terms of data format that the structures used to store the data. The experimental results presented in the paper show that the proposed algorithms excel when applied to different uncertain data sets, such as air quality and weather conditions.

The last four articles of this issue are more along the line of applied research. Graovac introduces an approach for automated categorization of text documents which includes a new dissimilarity measure between profiles. The technique that is based on K nearest neighbors is evaluated on several document collections in different languages. The results presented confirm that although the technique is fairly simple, in many cases it produces better results than other n-gram based methods. Zhao et al. in the next article introduce a new loss function for classification that could be considered as an approximation of the classical 0 X 1 loss function. The proposed loss function is compared with several existing loss functions in classification of noisy data sets. The presented experimental results show that the proposed method works better on noisy data sets, noisy features and outliers. Vateekul et al. in the tenth article of this issue discuss the problem of hierarchical multi-label classification along with performance evaluation in this field. The authors propose a new induction system which is based on support vector machines. In their experiments presented in the article they evaluate their system performance focusing on gene function prediction. And finally in the last article of this issue, Fang et al. discuss the importance of integrative data analysis focusing on the domain of life sciences and propose an integrative gene selection that is based on filter method and association analysis. The authors apply association analysis to analyse microarray data simultaneously with biological knowledge. Their experiments are based on four cancer related data sets and two types of biological knowledge. Their results show that models derived from a combination of biological knowledge and microarray data outperform the ones that are just derived from biological data alone.

In conclusion, with this issue of the IDA journal, which is Volume 18(4), we are glad to report contin-uous increase in submission of manuscripts to our journal. We are also contacted by many researchers in this field who would like to assist us in the evaluation of manuscripts. In addition, this year X  X  IDA sym-posium will be held from October 30th to November 1st, in Leuven, Belgium (http://www.ida2014.org/). We look forward to receiving your feedback along with more and more quality articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the field of IDA.

 Dear Colleague Welcome to volume 18(5) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal.

This issue of the IDA journal consists of eleven articles, all covering various topics related to the theoretical and applied research in the field of Intelligent Data Analysis.

The first five articles of this issue are about data understanding and search for patterns. Zimmerman in the first article of this issue discusses episode mining techniques and propose a process to compare these techniques using data simulation that mimics real world applications. This approach is based on recov-ering patterns that are embedded in noise. The experiments included in this article indicate that temporal constraints are more important in affecting the effectiveness of episode mining than occurrence seman-tics. Aghabozorgi and Wah in the second article of this issue discuss clustering of time series data and propose a new multi-step approach to accurately cluster time series data. From their experimental results that include data from different domains, the authors claim that their multi-step approach generates ac-curate clusters that are based on similarity in shape in very large time series data sets. Balasch-Masoliver et al. in the next article of this issue discuss the topic of multivariate aggregation in high dimensional data and argue that depending on the attributes chosen and their correlation, the amount of information loss and disclosure risk vary. The authors present a genetic algorithm based approach for multivariate microaggregation with its goal being finding optimal or near optimal attribute groupings taking into ac-count both information loss and disclosure risk. The approach is extensively experimented with results included in this article. Visconti et al. in the fourth article of this issue discuss the topic of efficient gene expression profiling through integration of additional information such as functional annotations. The authors propose a new bi-clustering approach that includes gene associations. Their approach sup-ports the extraction of biologically relevant bi-clusters through leveraging additional knowledge. This is demonstrated through experiments performed on several gene expression data reported in this article. The fifth article of this group, by Akdemir and Jannink is about the last step in search for patterns in data analysis. The authors propose some new methods for post-processing a large ensemble of conjunctive rules discovered through supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods. They show through various examples that for high dimensional regression problems the models constructed through post-processing the rules with partial least square regression have significantly better prediction performance than the ones produced by the random forest.

The next three articles focus on a different aspect of learning and classification. Pevec and Kononenko compare and examine two families of non-parametric approaches that are common in construction of prediction intervals for arbitrary regression models in the supervised learning framework. The first of the families introduced in this article is based on the ide a of explaining the total prediction error as a sum of model X  X  error and the second is based on the assumption of similarity of data. Their results on a large set of real and artificial data demonstrate one of these proposed methods always generates valid and superior results comparing to others. Similarly, the seventh article of this issue by Kutsuna and Yamamoto is about a parameter-free approach to one-class classification where they argue that parameter tuning is a difficult process in all classes of learning, especially when one class is the subject of study. The authors propose a one class classifier whose parameters can be tuned automatically. In this classifier, the region of a training data is expressed as a Boolean formula that is constructed by using a binary decision diagram. Their experimental results show that the proposed method works well with both synthetic and real data sets. Romero and de Campos in the last article of this group discuss multilabel classification and argue that due to its complexity, the most common approach is building binary classifiers and combining them afterwards. However, the basic assumption used in this approach which is class independence may not be valid for all problems. Therefore, the authors propose a methodology that is based on a combination procedure with a classifier trained on the co-occurrences of the labels. The results of experimenting the approach is shown in the article using three probabilistic base classifiers.
 The last three articles of this issue are mostly on applied research and novel applications. Allahyar and Sadoghi-Yazdi propose a new linear discriminant analysis (LDA) approach. This approach incrementally computes the solution of LDA with the time complexity that is lower than most incremental algorithms. In their experiments included in the article, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm along with its speed and accuracy are compared to several existing incremental algorithms. In the next application article, Movahedian and Khayyambashi discuss the importance of modeling in recommender systems and pro-pose a new system that is based on generating similarities between user and item profiles. These profiles are then extended by association rules discovered through an association rule mining process. Their pro-posed approach is evaluated using a real data set where their results show better representation of user interests. And finally, the last article of issue by Abreu et al. is about model based collaborative tech-niques. The authors develop a framework capable of automatically calculating the final game statistics through log-files where a feature selection algorithm is used to select the variables that most influence the final game results. The proposed approach that also includes steps such as ranking, clustering and selection of best strategies, is extensively experimented and the results are shown in the paper.
In conclusion, with this issue of the IDA journal, which is Volume 18(5), we are glad to report an excellent submission rate for the manuscripts submitted to our journal. Among the special issues that our colleagues are currently preparing, there is one that is related to the CIARP-2013 (Iberoamerican Congress on Pattern Recognition). We should have more news about the status of this special issue by Sept 2014. We look forward to receiving your feedback along with more and more quality articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the field of IDA.

 Dear Colleague Welcome to volume 18(6) of Intelligent Data Analysis Journal.

This issue of IDA journal, the last of 2014, consists of eleven articles, all covering various topics related to the theoretical and applied research in the field of Intelligent Data Analysis.

The first four articles are on frequent pattern discovery. Muino and Borgelt, in the first article of this issue, discuss synchrony in neuronal spike trains and present a framework for characterizing spike syn-chrony. In addition, they introduce a methodology and algorithms for identification of frequent parallel episodes in sequences of events. Results of their evaluation are presented in the paper. Line et al. ,in the next article of this issue, discuss methods for efficient updating of sequential patterns and present a study that extends a sequential-pattern-tree algorithm that is targeted for efficient handling of sequential patterns. Their experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has good performance for incre-mentally handling newly inserted transactions in large databases. Ryang et al. in the third article of this issue discuss the complexity of rule mining in items database and argue that in real world, items in the database have different nature. This point emphasizes that association rule mining needs to consider multiple minimum supports as a resul t of which one can expect to discover all item rules by reflecting their characteristics. The authors propose an algorithm for mining high utility itemsets with multiple minimum supports and their experimental results show that their algorithm outperforms comparing al-gorithms on both real and synthetic datasets. Abdul-Kadir et al. look at the frequent item sets from the point of view of ou tlier detection in which they propose an approach based on frequent negative itemsets. The idea is based on generating knowledge and discovering interesting patterns from frequent positive and negative itemsets to identify the outliers, which are essentially transactions that are common or rare. Their proposed idea is evaluated using a set of UCI data sets with interesting results for outlier detection. The next three articles are on the topic of data pre-processing and handling imbalanced data. Than and Ho discuss diversity and log-normality of data. Diversity is representative of variations in the attributes while log-normality is the situation where data follows a log-normal distribution. Methods such as La-tent Dirichlet Allocation are investigated for this problem which results in their limitations for modeling these two issues. A vibrational method, called Dirichlet lognormal topic model, is proposed in which model learning and inference are reduced to solving complex optimizational problems. The experiments reported in this article suggest that the predictive power of this proposed approach is consistent with diversity and log-normality. Cao et al in the next article discuss the issue of class imbalance in various forms and propose a method that is a combination of hybrid probabilistic sampling and diverse random subspace. The idea behind the combination of these two is apparently to solve both class imbalance and within class imbalance problems in certain classes of data. Their experimental results demonstrate that their proposed approach performs very well in imbalanced data sets. The last article of this group by Prachuabsupakij and Soonthornphisaj is also about imbalanced data. The authors introduce a new resam-pling technique that is based on clustering with sampling and it is primarily for multiclass imbalanced classification using ensemble techniques. Essentially their proposed approach is based on three steps which consist of: (i) a clustering step to create training sets, (ii) applying two resampling techniques to rebalance the class distribution and (iii) use of ensemble approaches to combine the models. The authors report on a carefully designed experiment to evaluate their proposed method.

The next two articles are on classification and learning. Adeli-Mosabab in the eighth article discuss the issue of multi-label classification in large scale data and propose a simple distributed algorithm for minimizing the nuclear norm of any data matrix in order to recover its low rank representation. Several synthetic and real data sets are used by the authors to evaluate the two elements of their approach which consists of nuclear norm minimization and distributed matrix completion. Taherian and Shiri in the next article of this issue discuss state abstraction and knowledge discovery in reinforcement learning and propose a framework to aggregate the results of state abstraction in multiple tasks of selected domains to be reused in future tasks of the same domain. In their approach, the authors show theoretically how abstraction speeds up learning and then they examine theoretically and algorithmically how to use the knowledge extracted by fuzzy value approximation of a single task in the future. The authors also show empirically that batch learning based on similarity measures can speed up learning in the future tasks of a given setting.

The last two articles of this issue are mostly on applied perspectives. Silva and Zarate in the tenth article of this issue provide a review of several approaches to deal with missing data. The main emphasis of their review is that one has to pay attention to the identification of the absence mechanism in order to choose the most appropriate method for missing values. And finally Thomaidou et al. in the last article of this issue, discuss ideas for an automated online advertising. They propose a methodology, an architecture and a framework for semi-and fully-automated creation, monitoring and optimization of pay-per-click advertising. Their prototype is experimentally evaluated on real world campaigns where the results are presented in the paper.

In conclusion, with this issue of the IDA journal, which is Volume 18(6), we are glad to report an excellent submission rate for the manuscripts submitted to our journal. Among the special issues that our colleagues have been working on and will be published soon, there is one that is related to the CIARP-2013 (Ibero American Congress on Pattern Recognition) and another one on BAFI-2014 (Busi-ness Analytics in Finance and Industry). We look forward to receiving your feedback along with more and more quality articles in both applied and theoretical research related to the field of IDA.
 1. Introduction
Text summarization was one of the early research areas for computer processing of text, driven by the hope that one could automatically mine keywords or create abstracts from scientific articles. Statistical approaches were developed in the late 1950s that showed promise, but the field soon became eclipsed by more trendy areas such as machine translation, or information retrieval.
 But the field has enjoyed a rebirth as can be noted by the number of summarization meetings held recently.
The explosion of online information, either on the web or in large organizational information stores, requires new ways of interacting with text, and summarization is an obvious technique.

Summarization is of interest to the natural language processing community and the information retrieval community, both of which have made significant contributions to this rebirth. Papers in this issue come from both communities. 2. The papers in this issue
The first paper in this issue,  X  X  X utomatic summarizing: the state of the art X  X , by Karen Spa  X  rck Jones, is a personal view of the field of summarization, examining current evaluation practices and in particular looking at the state of the art with respect to factors such as the purpose of the summary, the input material and the expected output. For each of these factors she identifies pertinent papers and points out major gaps in re-search. The final section of her paper discusses various system approaches, both extractive and non-extractive, again identifying pertinent papers and examining the relationships between the structures of these systems and task requirements.

There are then four papers dealing specifically with the evaluation of summarization. The first of them,  X  X  X ask-based evaluation of text summarization using relevance prediction X  X , by Stacy President Hobson, Bon-nie J. Dorr, Christof Monz, and Richard Schwartz, presents several user studies looking at the effects of substi-tuting manual or automatic summaries for full text documents in a relevance judgment type task. The second paper,  X  X  X lder versions of the ROUGEeval summarization evaluation system were easier to fool X  X , by Jonas
Sjo  X  bergh, points out some limitations in the original ROUGE evaluation measure and stresses that several different ROUGE measures should be used in comparing automatically-created summaries with human-created summaries. Continuing the evaluation theme, the third paper,  X  X  X UC in context X  X , by Paul Over,
Hoa Dang, and Donna Harman, provides an overview of the Document Understanding Conference (DUC), examining several overarching themes of these evaluations, such as generic versus focused summary evaluation, single document versus multiple document input, and length and compression issues. The fourth and final paper on evaluation,  X  X  X upervised automatic evaluation for summarization with voted regres-sion model X  X , by Tsutomu Hirao, Manabu Okumura, Norihito Yasuda, and Hideki Isozaki, presents a new automatic method that allows evaluation on a per summary basis rather than only on a per system basis, and shows less error when compared with human subjective scoring.

The next three papers deal with automatic creation of very short, headline length summaries and/or sen-tence compression. The first,  X  X  X bstractive headline generation using WIDL-expressions, by R. Soricut and
D. Marcu, uses a generic natural language generation engine to create headlines from automatically created encodings (WIDLs) of the most important topics in a document. This approach is compared using ROUGE with extractive approaches, such as those presented in the second paper on headline generation. This second paper,  X  X  X ulti-Candidate reduction: sentence compression as a tool for document summarization tasks X  X , by
David M. Zajic, Bonnie J. Dorr, Jimmy Lin, and Richard Schwartz, reports on experiments using three dif-ferent sentence compression schemes for both single and multiple document summarization applications. Re-sults using DUC news data are given, along with some preliminary work on speech and email input. The third paper on compression,  X  X  X iscriminative sentence compression with conditional random fields X  X , by Tadashi
Nomoto, uses a type of machine learning for single sentence compression, such as would be used in news bul-letins, RSS feeds, or text snippets. For training data they utilized RSS feeds, and performed additional work to improve the readability of their results.

Then come papers presenting system descriptions and results from four of the groups that have participated in the DUC evaluations. The first of these papers,  X  X  X CS: a system for querying, clustering and summarizing documents X  X , by Daniel M. Dunlavy, Dianne P. O X  X eary, John M. Conroy, and Judith D. Schlesinger, presents a statistical approach to summarization, utilizing a modular information retrieval system based on latent semantic indexing and also employing clustering and hidden Markov modeling to create the final extractive summary. They test variations in each of the components, measuring the effects in the final results. The second paper in this set,  X  X  X eyond SumBasic: task-focused summarization X  X , by Lucy Vanderwende, Hisami Suzuki,
Chris Brockett, and Ani Nenkova, also makes heavy use of statistical methods in a generic extractive system, but adds other modules for focusing, sentence compression/simplification, and expansion of topic words that employ natural language processing techniques. They show the effects of these modules both on the complete-ness of the summary (various ROUGE metrics), and on the linguistic quality of the summary. The third paper in this group,  X  X  X atisfying information needs with multi-document summaries X  X , by Sanda Harabagiu, Andrew
Hickl, and Finley Lacatusu, relies almost completely on natural language processing methods, starting with a complex question-answering system to generate sets of candidate summaries with respect to the question, and then using entailment to combine these into the final summary. In addition to presenting the system results in
DUC, the paper examines how well the process of question decomposition is working. The fourth and final paper of this set,  X  X  X ocument concept lattice for text understanding and summarization X  X , by Shiren Ye,
Tat-Seng Chua, Min-Yen Kan, and Long Qiu, presents a very different approach to summarization, based on identifying the concepts occurring in a set of documents, grouping those concepts into a hierarchy (or lat-tice), and then using this lattice to select the sentences to extract in order to build the summary. The system used older DUC data for training, with testing done with the DUC 2005 and 2006 data.

The next three papers examine particular natural language processing techniques that are important in summarization. The first paper,  X  X  X wo uses of anaphora resolution in summarization X  X , by Josef Steinberger,
Massimo Poesio, Mijail A. Kabadjov, and Karel Jez  X ek, examines anaphoric resolution for summarization, particularly in context of their LSA-based summarizer, showing the importance of proper use of the resolved entities. They also note a use for anaphor resolution in improving the coherence of the final summaries. The second paper,  X  X  X xploiting aspectual features and connecting words for temporal-relation in multi-document summarization X  X , by Bonnie Dorr and Terry Gaasterland, looks deeply into the extraction of temporal rela-tions between sentences, extending existing frameworks to deal with different event types. This type of time resolution is important, particularly in multi-document summarization, in order to improve both the accuracy and coherence of the final summaries. The final paper of this set,  X  X  X sing lexical chains for keyword extrac-tion X  X  by Gonenc Erkan and Ilyas Cicekli, examines a special type of summarization, that of keyword extrac-tion. Keyword summaries are useful in many applications, such as selection of documents or web sites from a ranked list, and the paper shows that lexical chaining techniques improve the quality of these keywords (using an evaluation comparing the results to author selected keywords).
 The last group of five papers in this special issue presents the use of summaries in various applications. The first of these papers,  X  X  X ser-Model based personalized summaries X  X , by Alberto D X   X  az and Pablo Gerva  X  s, investigates the use of profiles to extract and summarize information from newspapers, with these profiles identifying not only long-term/static interests, but also short-term needs. The paper presents a series of experi-ments, including a direct user evaluation of the system. The next paper,  X  X  X oise reduction through summari-zation for web-page classification X  X , by Dou Shen, Qiang Yang and Zheng Chen, shows the usefulness of manual web-page summaries for later classification of these pages. Experiments with six different automatic summarization techniques show almost comparable results with the manual summaries. The law domain is represented by  X  X  X ummarizing court decisions X  X , a paper by Marie-Francine Moens. This paper surveys the use of summarization in the legal area, especially in retrieval of legal cases and court decisions. The paper also examines important elements and issues with legal documents and points to potential areas for future research. The next paper,  X  X  X he use of domain-specific concepts in biomedical text summarization X  X , by Lawrence H.
Reeve, Hyoil Han and Ari D. Brooks looks at the medical domain, in particular the summarization of clinical trial data. Three different extractive methods are tested to automatically produce single-document abstracts, and these are evaluated using 24 texts against the author X  X  abstract and three other manual abstracts. The final paper of this set, and of the issue,  X  X  X enerating semi-structured gene summaries from biomedical literature X  X , by Xu Ling, Jing Jiang, Xin He, Qiaozhu Mei, Chengxiang Zhai, and Bruce Schatz works with structured summaries, in particular extracting sentences from biomedical literature that address specific semantic aspects of genes. Several different sentence extraction methods, including some standard baseline methods, are tried using the FlyBase gene summary database.
 Enjoy!!
