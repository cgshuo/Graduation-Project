 Patent litigation not only covers legal and technical issues, it is also a key consideration for managers of high-technology (high-tech) companies when making strategic decisions. Paten-t litigation in uences the market value of high-tech compa-nies. However, this raises unique challenges. To this end, in this paper, we develop a novel recommendation framework to solve the problem of litigation risk prediction. We will introduce a speci c type of patent-related litigation, that is, Section 337 investigations, which prohibit all acts of unfair competition, or any unfair trade practices, when exporting products to the United States. To build this recommenda-tion framework, we collect and exploit a large amount of published information related to almost all Section 337 in-vestigation cases. This study has two aims: (1) to predict the litigation risk in a speci c industry category for high-tech companies and (2) to predict the litigation risk from competitors for high-tech companies. These aims can be achieved by mining historical investigation cases and relat-ed patents. Speci cally, we propose two methods to meet the needs of both aims: a proximal slope one predictor and a time-aware predictor. Several factors are considered in the proposed methods, including the litigation risk if a compa-ny wants to enter a new market and the risk that a poten-tial competitor would le a lawsuit against the new entran-t. Comparative experiments using real-world data demon-strate that the proposed methods outperform several base-lines with a signi cant margin.

P atent litigation numbers have increased rapidly in recent years, as shown in Figure 1. This paper focuses on a spe-ci c type of litigation: Section 337 investigations. Section 337 investigations refer to investigations conducted accord-ing to Section 337 of the Tari Act of 1930 and its relat-ed amendments by the United States International Trade Commission (USITC). Section 337 investigations prohibit all acts of unfair competition, or any unfair trade practices, when exporting products to the United States. If convicted under a Section 337 investigation, the exporter's products may be permanently excluded from the US market, which can result in considerable economic losses. Most Section 337 investigation cases concern patents. As with intellectu-al property rights, Section 337 investigations are frequently used for blocking purposes. Both parties in a Section 337 investigation are competitors; hence such investigations can be a means of blocking competitors by preventing their mar-ket expansion. Therefore, predicting the probability of its involvement in a Section 337 investigation is crucial for the development of a high-tech company.

Section 337 investigations consume precious resources, and the outcome can signify success or failure to a company. Hence, it is critical for high-tech companies to understand their legal exposure in their industry category and from their competitors to be successful in such patent litigations. De-spite the increasing number of arguments and lawsuits, there are no reliable unbiased data mining methods on the pat-terns and trends of patent litigation in the United States[8] This paper aims to enable high-tech companies to develop data-driven intellectual property business strategies to suc-ceed in their challenging environments. For example, the Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi is being targeted by a U.S.-based patent troll. The troll company (Blue Spike LL-S) led a lawsuit against Xiaomi in a U.S. district court at the end of 2015. Thus, as Forbes reported, Xiaomi may have a major patent problem if it wants to enter the U.S. market. Xiaomi operates as an investment holding company and uses its subsidiaries for the development and transfer of its technologies and intellectual properties.

This paper has two aims: 1) to predict the litigation risk in a speci c industry category for high-tech companies, and 2) to predict the litigation risk from competitors for the high-tech companies. To achieve these goals and to identify the risky industry categories and competitors for high-tech companies, we must consider several factors. We must con-sider the litigation risk if a company wants to enter a new market, and further consider the risk that a potential com-petitor would le a lawsuit against the new entrant. The risks must be formally estimated. These issues can be an-swered by mining historical investigation cases and relat-ed patents. Speci cally, we develop two matrixes: 1) the company{category matrix predicts the litigation risk in a speci c industry category for a high-tech company and 2) the complainant{respondent matrix predicts the litigation risk from the competitors for a high-tech company. We pro-pose two methods to meet the needs of both aims: a prox-imal slope one predictor and a time-aware predictor. The proposed methods can work on di erent conditions, that is, companies previously engaged in lawsuits and companies never engaged in a lawsuit. Finally, we carry out exten-sive experiments on a real-world data set collected from the USITC. The experimental results clearly validate the e ec-tiveness of the proposed methods. With the results of this wit h one or more patents, and each U.S. patent has at least one class number. In this study, we determine the industry category by the patents that a company holds. However, US patents have 1,088 classi cations in total. Therefore, we reclassify the US patent data according to 56 industry categories with a mapping table.
We analyze the Section 337 investigation cases by regions and the companies involved.

Figure 3 shows the top 10 Section 337 investigation regions from 1982{2014. The gure shows that the allegations re-lating to patent infringements vary across regions over time. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Japan was the most intensive-ly investigated country, accounting for 43.15% of the total number of cases. Mainland China and Chinese Taiwan were also frequently investigated in the period 1982{2004. The Chinese mainland is currently the most frequent respondent in Section 337 investigations. Since 2004, Chinese products and companies have been involved in over 40% of Section 337 investigations, as the export volume of a region to the United States in uences the number of patent litigations. When the trade volume of a country or region increases sub-stantially with rapid economic development, the number of Section 337 investigations increases correspondingly. Japan, Chinese Taiwan, and Mainland China are all in the same situation. Fi gure 3: Top 10 respondent regions in Section 337 investigations.

Figure 4 shows the top 10 Section 337 investigation indus-try categories for 1982{2014. The gure shows that most of the cases are in material equipment domains such as building material processing equipment and assembly and material handling equipment, which are covered by a large number of patents. Electrical communication domains, including im-age and sound equipment and telecommunication, are also responsible for many Section 337 investigations.

Figure 5 shows the top 10 Section 337 investigation com-plainants for 1982{2014. We nd that most of the com-plainants are large high-tech companies that hold core tech-nologies and monopolistic advantages in their related do-mains. Such companies are motivated to retain their domi-nant position and to exclude competitors from the market.
Figure 6 shows the top 10 Section 337 investigation re-spondents for 1982{2014. We nd that Section 337 investi-gations are associated with companies that experience explo-sive growth. The top four respondents are all smartphone companies. The telecommunication sector has undergone is quite large. To reduce the number of calculations and en-hance the precision, we analyze the data by patent category rather than by patent itself. Thus, individual patents are replaced by their corresponding patent classi cations. As Section 337 investigations only protect the patents of United States, thus, we use the United States Patent Classi cation (USPC) system. The USPC system has 1,088 patent class-es, making it dicult to identify the patent classi cation for a company. Thus, we further amalgamate the USPC clas-si cations into industry categories. There are some works on patent classi cation mapping [13], we employ a common standards to map the USPC classi cations into 56 industry categories.

To construct the company{category matrix, we need to rst construct the company{classi cation matrix. The num-ber of times that a company has undergone a Section 337 in-vestigation determines its value in the matrix. After the nor-malization process, the company{classi cation value ranges between zero and ve. Formula 1 is used to normalize the company-classi cation value as follows: where x i indicates the actual number of patents in a patent classi cation related to Section 337 investigation cases that the company is involved in, x  X  i indicates the normalized val-ue, x min and x max indicate the minimum and maximum number of patents related with Section 337 investigation cas-es, respectively. is set to 5 for normalizing the value from 0 to 5.

The company{classi cation matrix is then transferred into the company{category matrix with a patent classi cation{ industry category mapping table. The proposed methods are used to calculate the prediction values in this matrix.
A sample predicted results of the company{category ma-trix is shown in Table 1. Let us consider, for example, the 0.326 rating at the intersection between the row of Compa-ny ID 51 and column of Category 10. This rating indicates that there is a 0.326 probability that Adidas America Inc. (Company ID 51) may be investigated under the bleaching and dyeing industry category (Category 10).

In the same way we develop the complainant{respondent matrix. The total number of Section 337 investigation cases is not large enough, such that the complainant{respondent matrix is quite sparse. Take cases in 2014 as an example, for company pairs, there are only 564 non-zero values of the 2 million values in the matrix. For the full duration data set used in this paper, there are 3,370 non-zero values for company pairs in the matrix.
Here, we convert the legal exposure prediction problem to a recommendation problem. We rst try to recommend the riskiest industry category and the riskiest competitor for a high-tech company. We then formally de ne the problem of legal exposure recommendation with time-awareness.
Definition 1. We have company c , and a set of indus-try categories A = a , each of which contains a set of in-vestigation probabilities p ai . The goal of the legal exposure recommendation is to build an optimal ranked list of industry categories.

Definition 2. We have company c , and a set of com-petitors B = b , each of which contains a set of investigation a lgorithm using a clustering method. In this paper, the k -means algorithm and the Slope One algorithm are combined to predict the litigation risk. The prediction value of the k -nearest neighbor vectors of the target company should be calculated using a sub-matrix of the company{classi cation matrix. This not only decreases the amount of calculations, but also relieves the problems caused by data sparseness. Speci cally, we rst establish patent classi cation vectors of the companies according to the historical patents related to Section 337 investigation cases. The k -means algorithm is employed to cluster the vectors into K clusterings. Then the k -nearest neighbor companies of the target company are screened and are used to construct the sub-matrix of the company{classi cation matrix. The prediction value in the sub-matrix is calculated using the Slope One algorithm. Fi-nally, we transfer the company{classi cation matrix to the company{category matrix. We can predict the litigation risk of the target company based on the company{category matrix.

Suppose the patent classi cation vector of a company can t classi cation and n is the total number of U.S. patent classi cations. The m vectors X are then clustered into K clusterings as C = { c k ; k = 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; K } , where each c k de-notes a vector group of similar companies. Suppose k is the clustering center of c k , the distance between each paten-t classi cation vector of a company and the clustering center can be calculated as: where ki is the value of the i -th patent classi cation of k .
For each company, we can obtain k -nearest neighbor paten-t classi cation vectors with the result of clusterings, and construct a sub-matrix A ij . The Slope One algorithm is employed to predict the values R ij in the sub-matrix. Ba-sically, a Slope One algorithm is used as follows. Suppose x and y indicate the value of two patent classi cations by company u . The two values conform to the linear relation y = x + b , where b is the parameter, and we obtain the esti-mated value ^ b of parameter b . After substituting the known value x , we obtain the estimated rating ^ y by company u . Formula 3 is used to calculate the value dev j;i between the target item Item j and item Item i . Formula 4 is then used to obtain the prediction value P ( u ) j : exible when modeling various temporal real-life situations. We improve the basic matrix factorization model [7] with a time-shifting baseline predictor. We combine the time-changing baseline predictor and the time-shifting baseline predictor to meet the needs of our problem. There are t-wo di erent conditions, which are 1) a company pair that has no historical litigations, and 2) a company pair with historical litigations. The rst condition is settled with the time-changing baseline predictor, and the second is settled with the time-shifting baseline predictor.
As shown in Figures 5 and 6, the number of Section 337 investigation cases is time-dependent. Before we deal with temporal e ects, we would like to establish the foundations of a static baseline predictor. A pure matrix factorization model could serve well in capturing the interaction between the users and items in a recommendation system. However, most of the observed values of litigation cases are due to e ects independent of the interaction associated with either complainants or respondents. For example, typical Section 337 investigation data exhibit large complainant and respon-dent biases. That is, some companies initiate more inves-tigations than other companies, and some companies face more investigations than others. We will encapsulate those e ects, which do not involve complainant-respondent inter-actions, within the baseline predictors [7]. These baseline predictors tend to capture much of the observed values, in particular much of the temporal dynamics within the data. Hence, it is vital to model them accurately, which enables the better identi cation of the part of the values that truly represents complainant{respondent interactions and should be subject to factorization.

Now we discuss how to construct a static baseline predic-tor. Suppose each complainant u is associated with vector p u and each respondent i is associated with vector q i . The overall average number of investigation cases is denoted by . A baseline predictor for an unknown value r ui is denoted by the observed deviations b u and b i of complainant u and respondent i , respectively, from the average as follows: where 1 and 2 are regularization parameters which make the values of b i and b u shrink towards zero. Here 1 = 10, = 25.

The static baseline predictor should then be integrated back into a factor model. The value is predicted by the rule:
To determine the vectors p u and q i , we minimize the reg-ularized squared error: where the constant 3 controls the extent of regularization, as usually determined by cross validation. In this paper, minimization is performed by typical stochastic gradient de-scent. The parameters are updated as follows: where t indicates the year of the last lawsuit.

To determine the involved parameters b i  X  Bin ( t ) , u and uk , we should solve: min where the constant 5 controls the extent of regularization, as usually determined by cross validation. In this paper, minimization is performed by typical stochastic gradient de-scent. The parameters are updated as follows:
The time-changing baseline predictor only considers the bias of the complainant and respondent in the current time period. Practical application shows that litigation should be predicted based on the bias in the prior time period. Thus, the time-shift characteristics of bias are studied in this pa-denotes the time-shift bias of the complainant, b u  X  Shift ( t ) de-notes the time-shift bias of the respondent, and p u  X  Shift ( t ) denotes the time-shift bias of the complainant's suppressed feature vector. We then extend the bias functions denoted in the prior section as follows:
Then the prediction rule is as follows:
We then split the data set into two groups: data of law-suits before time t and data of lawsuits at time t . For the rst data group, we employ a basic matrix algorithm to optimize the parameters b u , b i , q i and p u . For the second data group, min where the constant 6 controls the extent of regularization, as usually determined by cross validation. In this paper, minimization is performed by stochastic gradient descent. The parameters are updated as follows: p
In the experiments, we employ k-fold cross-validation. The data is divided into k roughly equal-sized parts ( k = 5 here). Of the k parts, a single part is retained as the validation da-ta for testing the predictor, and the remaining k  X  1 parts are used as training data. We use 1691 cases in the test set (out of 8,455 total cases in the data set). We then make recommendations for 2,806 companies, with an average of 2.41 observations per company for the entire training set.
We adopt three state-of-the-art baselines to evaluate the performances of our proximal slope one predictor. The rst baseline is a traditional collaborative ltering algorithm, that is, an item-based collaborative ltering algorithm (IBCF). The second baseline is matrix factorization algorithm (MF), which is one of the most popular approaches to collabora-tive ltering. Moreover, we also use a popular slope one algorithm, that is, a bi-polar slope one algorithm, as the third baseline. All results reported below come from the same test set to facilitate comparison.
We set up the evaluation as follows. First, we implement-ed our proximal slope one predictor and other baselines on the test data set. Speci cally, by performing the proximal slope one predictor, we rate the company{category matrix. We then obtain the RMSE value by comparing the results with the original rating. We set the clustering parameters k as 20, and it remained invariant during the experiment.
Figures 8 show the results of each approach. In the gure we can see that our approach consistently outperforms other baselines and the improvement is signi cant. These results clearly validate the e ectiveness of our proximal slope one predictor.
To further evaluate the performances of the di erent ap-proaches, we randomly select 10 cases including 8 companies for case study. The results of the case study are shown in Table 2. Two companies (Company ID 200, 587) fall within two categories. The closer the di erence between the pre-dicted value and the rating, the better the prediction accura-cy of the algorithm. According to the results, the prediction value of Proximal Slope One algorithm is closer to the o-riginal rating than that of the other three approaches. The extreme sparseness of the company-category matrix results that the parameters of MF could not be fully trained and optimized. Our approach is superior to matrix factorization algorithm due to no need of parameter training and optimiz-ing. The IBCF and the bi-polar slope one algorithms use all of the data from the training data set as their prediction Co mpany ID Cla ss Ca tegory Ra ting I BCF M F 7 1 2 58 20 0. 109 0 .277 0 .084 0. 249 0. 109 2 00 4 52 56 0. 217 0 .168 0 .061 0. 249 0. 217 2 00 6 02 53 0. 217 0 .228 0 .085 0. 249 0. 217 3 36 1 1 17 0. 109 0 .113 0 .011 0. 249 0. 109 5 87 2 29 18 0. 109 0 .129 0 .039 0. 249 0. 109 5 87 4 71 17 0. 109 0 .132 0 .027 0. 249 0. 109 8 46 4 48 48 0. 109 0 .191 0 .076 0. 203 0. 117 1 584 5 64 11 0. 326 0 .285 0 .262 0. 217 0. 040 1 874 5 26 9 0. 217 0 .243 0 .048 0. 249 0. 217 2 548 6 24 14 0. 109 0 .046 0 .085 0. 109 0. 099 b aseline predictor. For the setting of the number of itera-tions, if the number is smaller, the tting degree of training is not high enough. However, if the number of iterations is larger, there might be over tting. Thus, based on the results of the test, we set the number of iterations as 40.
As shown in Figure 9, the time-changing predictor per-forms better than the time-shifting predictor in the condi-tions of overall company pairs and company pairs with no historical lawsuits. In fact, it's extremely dicult to predict the legal exposure for a company without historical lawsuit data. It's even harder to predict the data in 2014 than in 2013, since there are much more new companies involved in Section 337 investigations in 2014. The rate of new compa-nies (20) out of all companies (651) in 2013 is 0.0307, while the rate of new companies (49) out of all companies (564) in 2014 is 0.0869. On the other hand, the time-shifting predic-tor performed better in other conditions. This indicates that if a company pair has never been engaged in a lawsuit, and has a lawsuit in the test year, we can predict using the time-changing predictor. If a company pair has been engaged in a lawsuit previously, we can predict using the time-shifting predictor. It should be noted that the proposed approaches do have some limitations. If the company pair has been in-volved in a lawsuit previously, and has no lawsuit in the test year, it is dicult to predict using either of our approaches.
Patent litigation covers both legal and technical issues, and is also a key concern of managers when making strate-gic decisions. Furthermore, patent litigation in uences the market value of a company. Lerner's research[10] shows that patent litigation can decrease the market value of the respon-dent companies by 2%{3.1%. Such lawsuits are usually used to prevent imitation by other companies. The patentee pre-vents the infringement use of technology via litigation. The technology barriers constructed by litigation can transform into market entry barriers. Such barriers guarantee that the patentee retains its dominant position in the market. Lan-jouw and Schankerman[8] argued there is a relationship be-tween the characteristics of patents and the likelihood that they will become involved in infringement lawsuits. Chien[3] shows that whether a patent is going to be litigated depends on the economic value of the patent, the characteristics of the patent owner, and the owner's propensity to litigate. By studying all of the infringement claims for a sample of recent-ly expired patents, Love[12] found considerable di erences in litigation practices between practicing and non-practicing p roposed to build models for a ranked prediction on whether to maintain or abandon a patent.
In this paper, we developed a recommendation framework for patent litigation risk prediction. The proposed frame-work clearly provides risky industry categories and risky competitors for high-tech companies when entering the US market. The design, analysis, and deployment of our recom-mendation framework are introduced in this paper. Specif-ically, we rst acquired related information of Section 337 cases from USITC, and integrated it into a data set. We also presented the results of our statistical analysis, at both a re-gional and company level. Two methods of collaborative l-tering, that is, proximal slope one predictor and time-aware predictor, are proposed in this paper. Finally, we evaluated our methods with extensive experiments on the real-world data set. The experimental results clearly validate the e ec-tiveness of our methods.

Potentially, this study has many future research direc-tions. First, it would be interesting to investigate new rec-ommendation models to improve the accuracy of litigation risk prediction. Second, we plan to build a professional rec-ommendation system to predict litigation risk for high-tech companies.
