 How to quickly and cheaply construct Web ontologies has become a key technology to enable the Semantic Web. Classical ontologies are not sufficient for handling imprecise and uncertain information that is commonly f ound in many application domains. In this paper, we propose an approach for constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy UML models, in which the fuzzy ontology consists of fuzzy ontology stru cture and instances. Firstly, the fuzzy UML model is investigated in detail, and a kind of formal definition of fuzzy UML models is proposed. Then, a kind of fuzzy ontology called fuzzy OWL DL ontology is introduced. Furthermore, we consider the fuzzy UML model and the corresponding fuzzy UML instantiations (i.e., object diagrams) simultaneously, and translate them into the fuzzy ontology structure and the fuzzy ontology instances, respectively. In addition, since a fuzzy OWL DL ontology is equivalent to a fuzzy Description Logic f-SHOIN(D) knowledge base, how the reasoning problems of fuzzy UML models (e.g., consistency, subsumption, equivalence, a nd redundancy) may be reasoned through reasoning mechanism of f-SHOIN(D) is investigated, which can help to construct fuzzy ontologies more exactly.

Fuzzy UML model, Fuzzy ontology, Ontology learning. Aiming to provide a common framewo rk that allows data to be shared and reused across appli cation and enterprise boundaries, the Semantic Web [2] has been pr oposed as the next generation of ontologies, there have been different approaches to characterize or define fuzzy ontologies. Sanchez [25] introduced a fuzzy ontology structure from the asp ects of lexicon and knowledge base. Calegari [5] developed a plug-in for the KAON Project in order to introduce fuzziness in ontology. Lee [11] presented a four-layered fuzzy ontology and a pplied it to news summarization. In more detail, Ortega [19] ma de a comprehensive review on the fuzzy ontologies and some relevant applications of them. of fuzzy ontologies, it is particul arly true in constructing fuzzy ontologies by extracting domain knowledge from the existing fuzzy data models (see Section 2) . To our best knowledge, so far, there are no reports on fuzzy ontology construction from fuzzy UML models. Especially many data sources are modeled in UML, and most of the databases today are modeled in UML [20]. If the translations from fuzzy UML models to fuzzy ontologies are realized, this will facilitate the development of fuzzy ontologies and the realization of semantic interoperations between the existing database applications and the Semantic Web. ontologies from fuzzy UML models, which focuses on deriving fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy UML models so as to capture as much conceptual knowledge as possible. The paper makes the following main contributions: z The fuzzy UML model is investigated in more detail based on z Since the paper aims at constructing fuzzy ontologies from z Furthermore, we consider the fuzzy UML model and the z Finally, since a fuzzy ontology constructed in the paper is introduces the related work. Sec tion III investigates the fuzzy UML model. Section IV introduces the fuzzy ontology. In section V, we realize the translations from fuzzy UML models to fuzzy ontologies at schema and instan ce levels respectively. Reasoning on fuzzy UML models with f-SHOIN(D) are also studied. Section VI shows the general conclusions and further work. Regarding the construction of (fuzzy) ontologies, several categories of approaches or tools are related to our work according to their focuses. The fuzzy UML model is the fuzzy extension of classical UML model [20]. In the following, different levels of fuzziness will be introduced into the UML model and the corresponding graphical representations are given. Objects model real-world entities or abstract concepts. An object is fuzzy because of a lack of information. For example, an object representing a part in preliminary design for certain will also be made of stainless steel , moulded steel , or alloy steel (each of them may be connected with a possibility, say, 0.8, 0.6 and 0.9, respectively). Formally, objects that have at least one attribute whose value is a fuzzy set are fuzzy objects. In a fuzzy UML model, a class is fuzzy because of the following several reasons [12]: properties. A class extensionally defined by these objects may be fuzzy. Then the objects belong to the class with membership degree of [0, 1]. their admissible values. The domains of some attributes may be fuzzy, and thus a fuzzy class is formed. specialization, and the supercla ss produced by some classes (in which there is at least one class who is fuzzy) by means of generalization, are also fuzzy. paper, the fuzzy class is denoted by using a dashed-outline rectangle to differentiate the classical class. From Figure 1, we have: (2) A fuzzy keyword FUZZY is appeared in front of the attribute An association S in a fuzzy UML model represents the relationship between n classes C 1 ,..., C n . Often, an association has association. identified in the association relationship: relationship occurs with a degree of possibility. A generalization is a taxonomic relationship between a more general classifier named superclass and a more specific classifier named subclass . The subclass is produced from the superclass by means of inheriting all attributes and methods of the superclass, overriding some attributes and me thods of the superclass, and defining some new attr ibutes and methods. subclass/superclass relati onship is fuzzy. In other words, a class is a subclass of another class with membership degree of [0, 1] at this moment. The methods for evaluating the membership degree have also been discussed in [12]. class hierarchy . The disjointness and cove ring constraints, which are optional, can be enforced on a class hierarchy. The disjointness means that all the specific classes are mutually disjoint, and covering means that the union of the more specific classes completely covers the more general class. generalization relationship. In this paper, a dashed triangular arrowhead is used to represent a fuzzy generalization relationship. 
Figure 4. A fuzzy generalizatio n in the fuzzy UML model. A dependency is a relationship between the source class and the target class, which denotes that a target class exists dependently on the source class. A fuzzy dependency relationship is a dependency relationship with a degree of possibility. In addition, the dependency between the source class and the target class is only related to the classes themselv es and does not require a set of instances for its meaning [16]. denoted by a dashed line with an arrowhead . It is clear that with respect to FS 1 (only part of representative data), here: John (uniquely identified by object identifier EmpID O 1 ) belonging to the class Young-Employee is 0.8. Similarly for u = 0.75. relationship Use , i.e., the possibility that the object instance John uses the Old-Computer O 2 , is 0.85. This is the second kind of fuzziness in fuzzy association in Section 3.1.3. Since the paper aims at constructing fuzzy ontologies from fuzzy UML models, it is necessary for us to give the formal definition and the semantics of the target ontologies. expressive sublanguages OWL L ite, OWL DL, and OWL Full [2]. OWL DL is the language chosen by the major ontology editors because it supports those users who want the maximum expressiveness without losing co mputational completeness and decidability of reasoning systems. Furthermore, the fuzzy extension of OWL DL (fuzzy OWL DL) has been extensively investigated to represent fuzzy data. In addition, several definitions of fuzzy ontology have been proposed (refer to [19]). firstly. Then, we report the fuzzy ontology definition presented in [28]. The fuzzy OWL DL [5], [23] is the fuzzy extension of OWL DL, which can be approximately viewed as the expressive fuzzy Description Logic f-SHOIN(D) [24]. Table 1 gives the fuzzy OWL DL abstract syntax , Description Logic syntax , and semantics . Based on the characteristics of fuzzy UML models in the previous section, we take into account only a part of constructors of fuzzy OWL DL abstract syntax. interpretation of f-SHOIN(D) (details refer to [24]). The individual domain,  X  FI is a fuzzy interpretation function. In Table denotes fuzzy class description, D denotes fuzzy data range, fuzzy ObjectProperty and DatatypePropert y identifiers are denoted by R and U , respectively, n is a nonnegative integer, #S denotes the cardinality of a set S. This section proposes an appro ach for constructing fuzzy OWL DL ontologies from fuzzy UML models. Firstly , we establish the mappings from fuzzy UML models to fuzzy OWL DL ontologies, including schema mapping (see Definition 3), and instance mapping (see Section 5.2). In addition, since a fuzzy OWL DL ontology constructed in this paper is equivalent to a Description Logic f-SHOIN(D) knowledge base [24], how the reasoning problems of fuzzy UML models may be reasoned through reasoning mechanism of f-SHOIN(D) is investigated, which can help to construct fuzzy ontologies more exactly. The Definition 3 gives the formal approach for translating a fuzzy UML model into a fuzzy OWL DL ontology structure. Starting with the construction of the ato mic identifiers, the approach induces a set of axioms from the fuzzy UML model, which forms the body of target ontology. The ontology can then be evaluated by the domain experts. In order to build fuzzy ontologies of high completeness, now we introduce how to define the mapping of instance level from fuzzy UML instantiations to fuzzy ontology instances. Here, the instances of fuzzy ontology are represented by the fuzzy RDF data models [13], [15], [26], which are generated by the mapping of fuzzy UML instantiations. values of a complete instantiation) reflects the values of fuzzy UML model FS 1 in Figure 6. In order to use the data with respect to the fuzzy UML model in a sema ntic context, a feasible solution is to map the fuzzy UML instantiation to RDF, the data format of the Semantic Web [2]. RDF provides a generic mechanism for expressing machine readable semantics of data [2]. For the purpose of mapping, the fuzzy UML instantiation should be mapped to the graph-based fuzzy RDF data model. In the following, based on [13], [15], [26], we briefly describe the fuzzy RDF data model. consists of nodes and labeled directed arcs linking pairs of nodes (i.e., a set of RDF statements). In order that the RDF can represent the fuzzy data, the RDF syntax must be extended to add to the statement &lt;subject, predicate, object&gt; a value. Such a value can be taken as a real number in the interval [0, 1]. n  X  G } is called an instance of G . configuration of the world, such that we can verify whether or not what is said on a graph G is true within the framework of fuzzy logic. membership degree of the couple, formed by the interpretation of the interpretation of the predicate, is greater or equal than n . where: degree  X  x  X  [0,1] to give an estimation of the belonging of x to V , URIrefs x via Is belonging to Ir  X  Ip, indicates the degree to a type literal x mapped via Is belonging to Ir, belongs to the set Iext ( Is ( y )), where y and z are elements of V . the corresponding fuzzy ontology in stance (i.e., the fuzzy RDF data model) is derived by the following mapping rules: instance) corresponds to the common subject of a collection of statements and the subject has an rdf:type property whose value is the fuzzy class name; Figure 7, we use two kinds of possibility distributions fuzzy disjunctive and fuzzy conjunctive to represent such values, respectively, which was preliminarily presented in [16]. fuzzy UML instantiation in Figure 7 by Definition 8. In Figure 9, the object identifier O 1 , uniquely denotes the Young-Employee John , is taken as the center in RDF statements and it has an rdf:type property. The value of this property is the fuzzy class Young-Employee with a membership degree, say 0.8, indicating to what extent the object represented by the object identifier O 1 belongs to the fuzzy class value of the attribute Age is fuzzy and it is represented by a disjunctive ( disc ) possibility distribution: {0.9/20, 0.7/24}.

A fuzzy OWL DL ontology constructed in the paper is equivalent to a fuzzy Description Logic f-SHOIN( D) knowledge base [24], i.e., a fuzzy UML model can be re-expressed in f-SHOIN(D). In particular, based on our previous trans lation work and the existing Logic f-SHOIN(D) were investigated. All of these will facilitate the development of fuzzy ontologies, and our approach may act as a gap-bridge between existing fuzzy UML applications (e.g., fuzzy UML for database modeling) and the Semantic Web. constructing (fuzzy) ontologies.
