 Recently Web 2.0 applications like social ta gging systems (or folksonomies) are getting more and more popular. One service often provided by these sites are tag recommender systems that help simplifying the process of tagging for the user. Given that users are free to tag, i.e., the same resource can be tagged differently by different people, it is important to personalize the recommended tags for an individual user. But state-of-the-art methods are not always able to suggest personalized tags for a new user or a new resource. Often these situations are handled by using the content of the new resource or just recommending the most popular tags. But these approaches have several draw-backs, first the recommended tags are not personalized and second, using content is not a generic approach, one needs to use diff erent algorithms for each type of resource, e.g., in Last.fm 1 information needs to be extracted from the audio files, in Flickr 2 im-ages need to be analyzed, in YouTube 3 knowledge from videos has to be extracted and for Delicious 4 and BibSonomy 5 the text of bookmarked web pages or publications be-longing to a B IB T E X entry needs to be assessed. Thus, this is a costly solution if one needs different approaches for several types of resources.

We propose a content independent, purely g raph-based approach, which is based on the observation that user profiles usually contain many untagged posts that could be exploited for improving the recommendations, especially when there are only a few tagged examples available. We investigate two scenarios, first where a new user enters the system and second, where among the untagged posts, there are new resources, i.e., resources that were not tagged by any other user in the system. We will address these problems by means of semi-supervised relati onal classification, whereby we can benefit from the structural information of untagged posts.

As presented in [1], we first cast the problem of personalized tag recommendations as a relational classification problem, where we use relational semi-supervised classi-fication to profit from the potentially valuable information carried by other untagged resources. In contrast to our approach submitted to the ECML/PKDD Discovery Chal-lenge 2009 (task 2) that achieved the second place, in this paper we focus on the cold-start problem (that did not occur in the challenge dataset).

In this paper our contributions are as follows: 1. We formally define the cold-start (in terms of new user/resource) problem in social 2. To address this problem we propose and compare different semi-supervised rela-3. Finally, we show empirically that our approaches outperform the current state-of-In [2] the authors compared several personalized tag recommendation algorithms, the best results, were achieved by the FolkRank algorithm [3], an adaptation of PageRank for retrieving information and recommending tags in social tagging systems. More re-cently Rendle et al. [4] introduced RTF (Ranking with Tensor Factorization), a method for learning a tensor factorization model optimized for the best personalized tag ranking. The model also handles missing values by introducing a new interpretation of the data and learns from pairwise ranking constraints through a gradient descent algorithm. The prediction runtime is independent of the number of observations and only depends on the factorization dimensions but the training time is huge. Another new factorization model for tag recommendation PITF (Pairwise Inter action Tensor Factorization) was introduced in [5,6], it tries to find latent interactions between users, items and tags by factorizing the observed tagging data. Similar to [4] the model is learned by optimizing the Bayesian Personal Ranking method with gradient d ecent. Although the methods discussed above provide high quality recommendations, they are not robust against new user/resource sce-narios. Furthermore, RTF and PITF strictly operate over ternary relations, and thereby are not able to exploit the information of untagged posts. For item recommendation a semi-supervised approach for cold-start probl ems has been recently published, the authors of [7] have introduced the tied Boltzmann machine that captures pairwise interactions be-tween items. To our best knowledge for cold-start problems in tag recommendation no graph-based, semi-supervised approach has been introduced so far.

Since tagging data forms relations between users, resources and tags, it is natural to exploit these relations by adapting relational methods to the tag recommendation scenario, in [1] we showed that relational classification methods perform very well on the ECML/PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009 dataset (which did not contain new users or resources). Originally relational methods have been applied to areas where entities are linked in an explicit manner, like hypertext documents and scientific publications. Especially iterative semi-supervised relational methods, which use collective inference and exploit relational autocorrelation of class labels of related entities, received atten-tion. One of the earliest iterative semi-supervised relational approaches was proposed by Chakrabarti et al. [8], where a probabilistic model for classification of web pages was introduced. In [9,10] the authors presented different semi-supervised iterative models and showed that collective i nference increases accuracy.

Here we will focus on the cold-start problem , where we expect that simple iterative semi-supervised relational methods outperform supervised approaches, since they allow the usage of unlabeled data, which is particularly important for cold-start scenarios. In this section we formalize the general problem of tag recommendations in social tag-ging systems, and formalize the new user/resource problem. 3.1 Problem Formulation Social tagging systems data usually comprises a set of users U , a set of resources R ,a set of tags T ,andaset Y of ternary relations between them, i.e., Y  X  U  X  R  X  T .Let be the set of all posts in the data. Let T ( x =( u, r )) := { t  X  T | ( u, r, t )  X  Y } be the set of all tags assigned to a given post x  X  X . We consider train/test splits based on posts, i.e., X train ,X test  X  X are disjunct and covering all of X : For training, the learner has access to the set X train of training posts and their true tags T | X train .Semi-supervised methods also could exploit the set X test of untagged posts, but of course not their associated true tags. The tag recomme ndation task is then to predict, for a given x  X  X for the respective resource. 3.2 New User/Resource An issue that remains unaddressed by the current literature on personalized tag recom-mendations refers to the new user/resource problems. A new user u refers to the user who posted for the first time in the system, i.e., In other words, all posts of a new user are in the test set. A new resource r , on the other hand, refers to a resource that has never been tagged before by any other user: Currently, there are no suitable purely graph-based 6 approaches for providing recom-mendations whenever these situations occur. Unpersonalized content-based approaches are usually used in such scenarios, but sin ce the resource X  format can vary across dif-ferent social tagging systems one woul d need to develop a specific method for each possible kind of resource. In this section we present the types of relations we use and introduce several semi-supervised relational methods for tag recommendation. Here we especially focus on the new user/resource scenario.

We propose to represent folksonomy data as a homogeneous, undirected relational graph over the post set, i.e., G := ( X, E ) in which edges are annotated with a weight w : X  X  X  X  R denoting the strength of the relation. Besides making the input data more compact  X  we have only a binary relation R X  X  X  X between objects of the same type  X  this representation will allow us to cast the problem of personalized tag recommendations as a relational classification problem.

Relational classifiers usually consider, relations between objects instead of only tak-ing into account the conventional attribute-value data of objects. A scientific paper, for example, can be related to another paper that has been written by the same author or be-cause they share common citations. It has been shown that relational classifiers usually perform better than purely attribute-based classifiers [8,11,12].

In our case, we assume that posts are related to each other if they share the same user: R user := { ( x, x )  X  X  X  X | user ( x )= user ( x ) } or the same resource: R res := { ( x, x )  X  X  X  X | res ( x )= res ( x ) } as an alternative we can use both relations to-gether, i.e, posts either share the same user or resource (see Figure 2): R res user := R user  X  R res . For convenience, let user ( x =( u, r )) := u and res ( x =( u, r )) := r denote the user and resource of post x respectively. Iterative relational methods have been shown to work very well because of the following th ree assumptions [13]: first, the first-order Markov assumption, i.e., in the tag recommendation scenario, only the direct neigh-borhood is necessary for accurate tag recommendations, second, the assumption of ho-mophily, i.e., similar posts are more likely to be tagged alike and third, the assumption of simple belief propagation, i.e., tag s can be propageted to untagged posts.
We are especially interested in the situation where related posts are untagged, thus differently from other appro aches (e.g., [2,4]) that use X train and T | X train allowing us to exploit the structural information of untagged posts using semi-supervised iterative relational methods. One simple relational classification method for tag recommendation is the WeightedAverage (WA) which sums up all weights of neighboring posts x  X  N x that share the same tag t  X  T and normalizes this by the sum over all weights in the neighborhood: with N x := { x  X  X | ( x, x )  X  X } being the neighborhood. This algorithm (in the following denoted as WA ) is similar to collaborative filtering, which is based on the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, the difference here is that k, does not need to be deter-mined but is given by the number of neighbors.

But what if some of the neighboring posts are untagged, how should we handle this situation? State-of-the-art methods just ignore untagged posts. Semi-supervised iter-ative methods in contrast do e xploit them and thus, increase classification accuracy. One simple way of considering untagged posts is to transform WA into an iterative al-gorithm, i.e., in the first iteration we classify test posts by only using direct neighbors from the training set, in the second iteration, the still unclassified test posts are classified by extracting tag information from neighbors that have been classified in the previous iteration. The procedure stops when all the test instances are classified. This iterative version of WA is denoted as WAOneShot since all test posts are classified only once, i.e., already classified posts are not re-classified in the following iteration. Note that eq. (1) considers the tags of the neighborhood in a det erministic way i.e ., probab ilities are not taken into account, so that even if the probability of a estimated tag is very low it is considered in the same way as a high probability tag. To overcome this limitation one can extend eq. (1) to PWA ( Probabilistic Weighted Average ): Now, instead of only summing up edge weight s of direct neighbors, we additionally take into account the probability of the tags belongi ng to those neighbors. Combining eq. (2) with the aforementioned iterative algorithm leads to a probabilistic semi-supervised iterative method which makes use of the uncertainty of tag estimations in previous iterations. This algorithm is denoted as PWAOneShot . The algorithms, WA , WAOneShot , PWA and PWAOneShot use only the first two properties of relational methods, namely the first-order assumption and the homophily but not the third property. Thus, for both algorithms test posts are not re-classified even if tags of neighbors have changed, i.e., the information cannot be spread in the graph.

To resolve this problem relaxation labeling [8] can be used, i.e., we make use of the third property of simple belief propagation, here the tag probability of all test posts are re-estimated simultaneously in each iteration, i.e., the infomation spreads in the graph which helps to increase accuracy. PWA combined with relaxation labeling is denoted as PWA* . The algorithm for PWA* is depicted in Figure 1. There we first initialize the untagged posts with the prior probability calculated using the training set, then we com-pute the probability of each tag t given x iteratively using PWA . The procedure stops when the algorithm converges (i.e., the difference of the tag probability between itera-tion i and i +1 is less than a very small ) or a certain number of iterations is reached. Note that eq. (1) and eq. (2) have been intr oduced in [14] and applied to relational datasets. The weight w in eq. (1) and (2) is an important factor in the estimation of tag probabilities, since it describes the strength of the relation between x and x .Weused the weight schemes described in [1]. Since we want to recommend more than one tag we need to cast the tag recommendation problem as a multilabel classification problem, i.e., assign one or more tags to a test post. We accomplish the multilabel problem by sorting the calculated probabilities P ( t | x ) for all x  X  X test and recommend the top n tags with highest probabilities.

In terms of runtime complexity, PWA* is in O ( I  X  ( | T | X  N x )) for prediction and O (1) for training. I.e., the runtime is only depe ndent on the number of iterations, number of tags and the size of the neighborhood. 4.1 Cold-Start Problem Semi-Supervised relational classification is especially usefull for addressing cold-start problems where users have untagged resources in their profiles, since, in contrast to the current state-of-the-art, it is able to exploit the structural information of untagged posts and to propagate this information in the post gra ph. In general our semi-supervised approach is able to extract information from two sources and two relations, from the tagged posts and untagged posts over R res or R user which is very beneficial fo r the coldstart problem.
In figure 2 we illustrate the new user/resource problem. The gray nodes in the given post graph represent the untagged posts, the white nodes belong to the training set. In our example user u 8 is a new user, she has several untagged posts. In order to recom-mend tags for post ( u 8 ,r 7 ) for example, we can make use of both information sources, from the test set (this post is an untagged post of user u 3 ). Second, through R user with her own untagged posts ( u 8 ,r 2 ) and ( u 8 ,r 6 ) . Thus, the system can profit from both, the training set over the resource relation and from the untagged posts belonging to the users own profile. For the new resource problem in contrast we cannot use R res , but only R user . In figure 2 r 6 is a new resource, so if we want to recommend tags for ( u 8 ,r 6 ) one our methods still benefit from them, because th ey are connected to other posts and this information spreads over the graph. Since our graph can be composed by two kinds of relations at the same time, when one relation is missing (e.g., new user or resource), there is always another relation as backup. The only scenario where this does not hold is when all the resources uploaded by a new user are new. The main issues we want to address here is the new users/resources scenario. We con-duct two main experiments to show that our semi-supervised methods are able to cope with these issues. We compare several semi-supervised relational models ( WAOneShot , PWAOneShot , PWA* ) with state-of-the-art methods like WA, FolkRank 7 , PITF (tensor factorization model), and the most popular tags on two real-world datasets. 5.1 Datasets In order to evaluate our approach we use two real-life datasets, BibSonomy and Last.fm 8 . BibSonomy is a social tagging system that allows users to manage and annotate book-marks and publication references simultaneously. Last.fm on the other hand, is a social online radio station where people can upload, share and tag music/artists/albums they like. Since these systems represent different domains and are evtl. used by different people, we assume that our findings can also be carried over to other social tagging systems. We follow the conventional approach of using the dense part of Y by means of a p-core 9 . Similarly to [2,4], we used the 5-core for BibSonomy and the 10-core for Last.fm. Table 1 summarizes the charact eristics of the datasets we used. For conve-R 5.2 Experiment Setting We analyzed two situations, one where only new users, and a second where new users and new resources were present in the data. For the first situation (new user problem), the test set is composed by only new users (we sampled 30% of the users in U to be in the test set, the rest is used for training) but no new resources. For the second scenario, i.e., new user and new resource problem, we sampled for each user a percentage of test resources to be new. We evaluated our methods on data where 1% and 10% of the test posts contain new resources. In reality many users have untagged resources in their profiles but those untagged posts are usually removed from the standard datasets, thus we simulated this situation. We use the standard LeavePostOut [2] protocol, but additionally exploit the untagged posts, i.e., while recommending tags for one post, the other sampled posts are used as untagged posts (their tags are removed).

We used the standard F 1 measure on top-5 tag lists, similar to [5] we estimate the optimal number of tags to be recommended (i.e., we do not always recommend 5 tags). As in [1] we rewarded the best relation by a weight of c 10 . We optimized c as well as the hyperparameters for PITF on a holdout set. Moreover, we restricted the maximum number of iterations for the PWA* algorithm to 75. 5.3 Results and Discussion New User Problem. Figure 3 shows the results achieved with PWA* , WAOneShot , PWAOneShot , FolkRank, PITF, WA and the most popular 11 algorithm for various num-bers of recommendations (1-5) applied to BibSonomy. All users in the test set are new but all resources are known in the system already. This is reflected in the results, the difference among the results is small, PWAOneShot , WAOneShot and WA perform very similar. WA performs well since every test post i s connected to at least one training post, thus recommendation of tags is possible for each test post. But even in this situa-tion where there are more connections between test and training set, PWA* outperforms the other algorithms, i.e., can still profit from label propagation and initialization of test posts. The situation changes for Last.fm (see Figure 4). Here both FolkRank and PITF outperform all other methods. PWA* performs best among the semi-supervised meth-ods, but seems not to profit so much from label propagation and initialization of test posts. PWAOneShot , WAOneShot and WA achieve again very similar results. The rea-son lies in the nature of this dataset, here the user relation contains the more valuable information, the same phenomena was observed in [2]. So, in this case, proposing tags that the user already used in the past instead of tags other users attached to the resource, may provide a better chance to suggest the tags the user finally chose. Since, the most valuable tag information is contained in R user , but all the users in the test set are new and R res yields low quality recommendations, unprom ising labels are propagated, hence leading to poor results. FolkRank and PITF on the other hand, does not suffer from ill propagated labels and moreover, FolkRank can explore other users, resources and tags that are only indirectly connected to the test posts, which in this dataset at least, seems to yield a great benefit.
 New User/Resource. Figure 5 shows the results for the second scenario on the Bib-Sonomy dataset, where both the new user and new resource problem occurs. In general one can see that as the number of new resources increases the results deteriorate, but in both cases (1% and 10% of new resources) the semi-supervised relational methods out-perform the state-of-the-art methods, while PWA* achieves the best result. As expected WA does not perform very well since some test posts are only connected to other test posts, so that in some cases it cannot recommend any tags. The reason why PWA* per-forms particularly good in this dataset, is because here the R res relation already contains usefull tag assignments, and since this relation is the only training information avail-able, it leads to the propagation of promising labels. Folkrank performs similar to WA and WAOneShot but is slightly outperformed by PITF. Again, for Last.fm (see figure 6) things are a little different. For both situations (1% and 10% of the resources are new), PWA* still achieves the best result. In the 1% case PWAOneShot too, achieves better re-sults than the state-of-the-art. PWA* and PWAOneShot perform better because they use probabilities, which is not the case for WAOneShot . WA performs poorly, since, for many test posts no tags can be recommended since many test instances are only connected to test posts. FolkRank and PITF on the other hand, do not maintain the same performance achieved on the new user problem. This happens because the number of connected tag assignments to the test posts decreases proportionally to the number of new resources inside the posts of a new user, thus making it difficult to compute a good set of tags. In this particular situation, the simple most popular method performs surprisingly good, showing that in special cold-start cases, like this, it is a good alternative.
In general the re-estimation and propaga tion of labels in the post graph as well as the initialization of test posts seems to be the main reason for the good results of PWA* (since PWA* performed better than PWAOneShot ). Furthermore, we see that the new user problem is easier to handle than situations where both new users and new resources occur, since the graph is less sparse, and therefore supervised methods work almost as well (or better) as semi-supervised methods. In this paper we have introduced an approach for tag recommendations that is par-ticularly suitable for the cold-start problem. Our model is based on semi-supervised relational classification, that allows to exploit the structural information of untagged posts. We evaluated our approach against state-of-the-art methods in two real world datasets. We showed that semi-supervised relational methods which are based on label propagation are achieving very good results. In some special cases though, where the available training relations are of low qua lity, unpromising labels can be propagated thus deteriorating the results. In future work we want to investigate automatic ways of detecting more informative relations as well as other semi-supervised methods and new kinds of relations between the posts (e.g. content-based) for further improvement of cold-start related issues.
