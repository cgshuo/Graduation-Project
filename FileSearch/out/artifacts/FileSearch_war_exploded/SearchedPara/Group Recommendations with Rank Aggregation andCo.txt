 The majority of recommender systems are designed to make recommendations for individual users. However, in some circumstances the items to be selected are not intended for personal usage but for a group; e.g., a DVD could be watched by a group of friends. In order to generate effective recom-mendations for a group the system must satisfy, as much as possible, the individual preferences of the group X  X  members.
This paper analyzes the effectiveness of group recommen-dations obtained aggregating the individual lists of recom-mendations produced by a collaborative filtering system. We compare the effectiveness of individual and group rec-ommendation lists using normalized discounted cumulative gain. It is observed that the effectiveness of a group rec-ommendation does not necessarily decrease when the group size grows. Moreover, when individual recommendations are not effective a user could obtain better suggestions looking at the group recommendations. Finally, it is shown that the more alike the users in the group are, the more effective the group recommendations are.

Recommender Systems (RSs) are software tools and tech-niques suggesting to a user a well selected set of items match-ing the user X  X  taste and preferences [18, 1, 4]. The sugges-tions relate to various decision-making processes, such as what items to buy, what music to listen to, or what on-line news to read. They are widely used in Web-based e-commerce applications to help online users to choose the most suitable products, e.g. movies, CDs, books, or travels.
The large majority of RSs are designed to make recom-mendations for individual users. Since recommendations are usually personalized, different users receive diverse sugges-tions. However, in some circumstances the items to be se-lected are not intended for personal usage but for a group of users; e.g., a DVD could be watched by a group of friends or in a family. These groups can vary from stable groups to ad hoc groups requiring recommendations only occasionally.
For this reason some recent works have addressed the problem of identifying recommendations  X  X ood for X  a group of users, i.e., trying to satisfy, as much as possible, the in-dividual preferences of all the group X  X  members [8]. Group recommendation approaches are either based on the gener-ation of an integrated group profile or on the integration of recommendations built for each member separately (see sec-tion 2). Group RSs have been designed to work in different domains: web/news pages [17], tourism [15, 13], music [6, 14], TV programs and movies [16, 21].

A major issue in this research area relates to the difficulty of evaluating the effectiveness of group recommendations, i.e., comparing the generated recommendations for a group with the true preferences of the individual members. One general approach for such an evaluation consists of inter-viewing real users. In this approach there are two options: either to acquire the users X  individual evaluations for the group recommendations and then integrate (e.g., averaging) these evaluations into a score that the group  X  X ointly X  as-signs to the recommendations; or to acquire directly a joint evaluation of the group for the recommendations. In the first case one must decide how the individual evaluations are integrated; this is problematic as different methods will produce different results and there is no single best way to perform such an integration. Another difficulty, which is common to both options, as was observed by [12], is related to the fact that the satisfaction of an individual is likely to depend on that of other individuals in the group (emotional contagion). Moreover, on-line evaluations can be performed on a very limited set of test cases and cannot be used to extensively test alternative algorithms.

A second approach consists of performing off-line evalu-ations, where groups are sampled from the users of a tra-
