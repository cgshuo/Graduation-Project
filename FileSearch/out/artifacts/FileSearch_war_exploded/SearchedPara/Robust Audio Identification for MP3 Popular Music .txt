 Audio identification via fingerprint has been an active research field with wide applications for y ears. Many technical papers were published and commercial software systems were also employed. However, most of these previously reported methods work on the raw audio format in spite of the fact that nowadays compressed format audio, especially MP3 music, has grown into the dominant way to store on personal computer s and transmit on the Internet. It would be interesting if a comp ressed unknown audio fragment is able to be directly recognized fro m the database without the fussy and time-consuming decompression-identification-recompression procedure. So far, very few algorithms run directly in the compressed domain for music inform ation retrieval, and most of them take advantage of MDCT coe fficients or derived energy type of features. As a first attempt, we propose in this paper utilizing compressed-domain spectral entropy as the audio feature to implement a novel audio fingerprinting algorithm. The compressed songs stored in a mu sic database and the possibly distorted compressed query ex cerpts are first partially decompressed to obtain the MDCT coefficients as the intermediate result. Then by grouping granules into longer blocks, remapping the MDCT coefficients into 192 new frequency lines to unify the frequency distribution of long and short windows, and defining 9 new subbands whic h cover the main frequency bandwidth of popular songs in accordance with the scale-factor bands of short windows, we calcul ate the spectral entropy of all consecutive blocks and come to the final fingerprint sequence by means of magnitude relationshi p modeling. Experiments show that such fingerprints exhibit strong robustness against various audio signal distortions like reco mpression, noise interference, echo addition, equalization, band-pass filtering, pitch shifting, and slight time-scale modi fication etc. For 5s -long query examples which might be severely degraded , an average top-five retrieval precision rate of more than 90% can be obtained in our test data set composed of 1822 popular songs.

Music identification is the most typical application of audio fingerprinting technique. By co mparing the fingerprint of an unknown music query fragment, usua lly transmitted from mobile phones on the wireless telecom network or from personal computers on the Internet, with those previously calculated and stored in a fingerprint database, matching results and related metadata are returned. The fingerprint must characterize the nature of music content to differentiate from each other, and possess strong robustness against various kinds of audio signal degradations. Also, the query musi c fragment is usually required to be only a few seconds long, na mely fit the demand of fragment retrieval. To date, a number of algorithms such as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] have been published with rather high retrieval precision. Most of them run on the raw wave format, and commercially deployed software systems also appeared [7]. 
However, with the mature of CD quality audio compression techniques at low bit rate and the fast growing of the Internet, compressed audio signals are increasingly ubiquitous and have become the dominant fashion of storing in personal electronic equipments and transmitting on the Internet. It would be interesting and meaningful in practice if audio features are directly extracted from the compressed domain and used for music identification in the database. 
So far, only a few algorithms are designed to perform music information retrieval (MIR) dire ctly in the compressed domain, the compressed-domain energy distribution from the output of the poly-phase filters as features to index songs. For each song in the data set, they use its refrain as the query example to retrieve all similar repeating phase s, obtaining an average 78% recall and 32% precision rate. They claim that, to their knowledge, this is the first compressed-domain MIR algorithm. Lie et al . [9] directly use selected modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) spectral coefficients and derived sub-band energy as well as its variation to represent the tonic characteristi c of a short-term sound and to match between two audio segmen ts. The retrieving probability achieves up to 76% among the top 5 matched. Tsai et al . [10] describe a query-by-example algorithm using 176 MP3 songs of a same singer as the database. They calculate spectrum energy from sub-band coefficients (SBC) to simulate the melody contour and use it to measure similarity between the query example and those database items. By summing up the sub-band coefficients in every 12 frames (about one tone duration) to obtain tone energy lines, the melody contour is represente d by a string sequence with two letters (U, D), where  X  X  X  means the current tone energy is smaller than its preceding one and  X  X  X  means greater. With 40 frames assembled as a query example, the accuracy achieves 74% within top 4 and 90% within top 5. In Tsai's another paper [11], they use scale factors (SCF) and sub-band coefficients in a MP3 bit stream frame as features to characteri ze and index the object. All SCF and SBC values are divided into 26 bins using a tree-structured quantizer, values in the same bin are accumulated to form a histogram as the final indexing patterns. Due to its statistical nature, this approach can tolera te certain length variance between the query example and database items. When length variance is between [0%, 10%), [10%, 15%), [15%, ), the query item can be obtained in top 5, 10, 15 results, respectively. Pye et al . [12] design a new compressed-domain a udio feature referred to as MP3 cepstrum (MP3CEP) based on partial decompression of MPEG layer-3 audio signals to facilitate the management of a typical digital music library. It is approximately six times faster than conventional MFCC coefficient for music retrieval while the average precision is only 59%. Jiao et al . [13] design a robust compressed-domain audio fingerpr inting algorithm, taking the ratio between the sub-band energy and the full-band energy of a segment as intra-segment feature and difference between continuous intra-segment features as inter-segment feature. Experiments show that such fingerprints are robust against transcoding, down sampling, ec ho addition and equalization. However, the authors didn't show any results on the retrieval precision rate. 
The above methods acquired certa in retrieval achievements, whereas they have two critical lim itations. The first is that none of them works in the way of fragment retrieval, which is a basic requirement of audio fingerprintin g systems; the second is that robustness is not considered in the above methods except reference [13] which shows some basic robustness results without taking account of the two most ch allenging distortions i.e. tempo-reserved pitching shifting a nd pitch-reserved time-scale modification (TSM). Moreover, previously used features principally follow the line of MDCT coefficient and its derived spectral energy, then can we develop a new type of compressed-domain feature to achieve high robustness in music identification? It's well known that entropy plays an important role in information theory as a measure of information, choice and uncertainty, it has been widely used in many fields like automatic speech recognition (ASR) [14], uncompressed-domai n robust audio identification [15] and speech/music classifi cation [16]. So far, various compressed-domain audio features including scale factors [17, 18], MP3 window-switching pattern (WSP) [19, 20], basic MDCT coefficients and derived spectral energy, energy variation, duration of energy peaks, amplitude envelope, spectrum centroid, spectrum spread, spectrum flux, ro ll-off, RMS, rhythmic content like beat histogram etc [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] have been used in different applications such as retrieval, segmentation, genre classification, speech/music discrimination, summarization, singer identification, watermarking and beat tracing/tempo induction. However, in spite of the extensive use in various research fields for years, to the authors X  knowledge, we are not aware of the usage of entropy for music identification in the compressed domain. This motivated our initial idea of developing MDCT spectral entropy as a novel audio feature for robust music identification. 
In this paper, we first group 22 MP3 bit stream granules, the basic processing unit in decoding, into a longer window which is called  X  X lock X  for the statistical purpose. Then we remap the 576 MDCT coefficients extracted from a granule of partially decoded MP3 songs into 192 new frequency lines to unify the frequency distribution of long and short wi ndows. After dividing these new MDCT values into 9 new subbands in terms of the scale-factor bands of short windows, we calculate the spectral entropy of every block and acquire the final fingerprint sequence via magnitude relationship modeling. Ex perimental results show that this MDCT spectral entropy based fingerprint achieves high robustness against common audi o signal distortions like recompression, noise contaminati on, echo addition, equalization, band-pass filtering, pitch sh ifting and slight time-scale modification etc. A query exampl e of 5s-long music, even if severely degraded by various time-frequency distortions, is sufficient to retrieve its original recording with an average top-five precision rate of more than 90% in our test data set composed of 1822 popular songs. 
The remaining paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic principles of MPEG Layer-3, bit stream data format, and the concept of compressed-domain spectral entropy. Section 3 details the steps of de riving MDCT entropy based audio fingerprint and the searching st rategy. Experimental results on retrieval precision unde r audio signal distortions are given in section 4. Finally, section 5 co ncludes this paper and points out possible ways for future research. A simplified illustration of MPEG Layer-3 encoder is shown in Figure 1. The input PCM signa l is mapped into 32 equal-bandwidth subbands through a polyphase filterbank, which simulate the critical bands in the human auditory system (HAS). The sub-band outputs are further subdivided by MDCT transform using long or short window to provide better spectral resolution. The long window allows greater frequency resolution for audio signals with stationary charact eristics, while the short window provides better time resolution for transients. Combined with other adjuvant techniques includ ing psychoacoustic model, scale-factor, Huffman coding, quantization etc, the final compressed bit stream is generated [27]. Figure 2 displays the frame format of MP3 bit stream, and each frame has two granules to exploit further redundancies. Figure 1. Simplified freque ncy transformations of MPEG 
In MP3 decoder, the basic unit of input bit stream is a granule of 576 samples, approximately 13 ms at the sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. One granule of compressed data is first unpacked and dequantized into 576 MDCT coeffi cients, then mapped to the polyphase filter coeffi cients in 32 subbands by IMDCT. Finally, these sub-band polyphase filte r coefficients are inverse transformed and synthesized into PCM audio. Therefore, access of transformation coefficients in Layer 3 can be either at the MDCT or the filterbank level, the la tter is obviously more time consuming. 
Entropy is a fundamental concept in information theory to measure the uncertainty associated with a random variable [28]. If a random variable X is discrete with possible values { x n }, the Shannon information entropy of X can be explicitly defined as, where p ( x ) denotes the probability mass function (PMF) of X , b is the base of the logarithm used and typically adopted as 2. With respect to a random signal, it s entropy is a measure of how unpredictable it is. The entropy will be minimum when the signal is constant since it is most predictable and on the contrary maximum if the signal has a uniform distribution so that sample values are most unpredictable. F or example, voiced sounds with clear formants have lower entrop y; oppositely, flatter spectrum corresponding to non-speech or noisy regions has higher entropy [14]. Entropy is therefore expected to be different from those usual features derived from spectr al energies and to capture the nature of audio content with a distinctive capability. 
Follow this line of thought, we propose to calculate the MDCT spectral entropy as follows. Without loss of generality, we only take a set of MDCT coefficients X ={ x 1 , ..., x n } as an illustration, detailed formulation compliant with MP3 bit stream format will be described in the next secti on. In light of formula (1), the biggest problem to compute the en tropy of a spectrum distribution lies in that spectrum itself does not possess the necessary property of a PMF, namely all the spectrum elements don X  X  sum up to 1. In order to convert the original MDCT spectral coefficients into a PMF-like function, we divide ev ery individual MDCT coefficient by the sum of all components, i.e. by sum normalization, to approximate its probability as shown in formula (2). Then formula (1) can be used to compute the MDCT spectral entropy. 
As stated in the introduction, the goal we calculate MDCT spectral entropy is to use it as an audio feature for compressed-domain music identification, then is it steady enough under various audio signal distortion s? We did some experiments to check it. Figure 3 shows the MDCT entropy sequence calculated as above from a 6s clip of compressed song after granule grouping and sub-band division as detailed in the next section. It can be clearly seen that the entropy curve is rather stable under volume modulation, echo addition, band-pass filtering, noise interference and MP3 recompression at 32kbps. For pitch shifting up to  X  10% and 10-band equalization, thou gh relatively bigger entropy variation is introduced compared with the above, the basic profiles are maintained. When the example excerpt is slightly time-scale modified,  X 2% in experiment, the entropy curve only translates a small distance along the granule/time axis with little change to the spectral entropy contour. These observed phenomena confirm our initial motivation, and herein MDCT spectral entropy displays great potential to become a powerful audio fingerprint. Figure 3. MDCT spectral entropy curve under various audio signal degradations. From the first to the second row, the curve of a clip of 6s origin al audio and distorted versions under volume modulation, noise addition, band-pass filtering, lossy recompression, echo addition, pitch shifting, equalization and time-scale modification are drawn for comparison The whole algorithm includes five steps stated as follows. 
Compared with conventional content-based music information retrieval, fragment input and robustness are known to be two crucial constraints on audio finge rprinting schemes to retrieve in a music database. If modeling with audio signal operations, the input fragmented query example can be obtained from the original music via random cropping plus other types of audio processing. Random cropping causes seriou s desynchronization problem between the input fingerprint se quence and its stored original version, posing a serious threat on the retrieval accuracy. In general, there are two effective mechanisms to resist time-domain misalignment: one is invariant feature, the other is implicit synchronization which might be more powerful than the former [29]. However, in the MPEG compressed domain, due to the inherent data nature of compresse d bit stream and the fixed frame structure, it is almost impossible to extract meaningful salient points serving as anchors as in the uncompressed domain [30]. Therefore, designing statistically stable audio features and adopting heavy overlap between adjacent time-domain processing units become the only two ways to counter desynchronization and fulfill the task of fragment retrieval in audio fingerprinting. 
To achieve this end, we first n eed to calculate the audio feature in longer time duration to alleviate its fluctuation over time. In the proposed method, we group 22 gra nules, the basic processing unit in the MP3 compressed bit stream, into a so-called  X  X lock X  as the basic time unit to compute audio fe atures. Next, a hop size of 1 granule between two consecutiv e blocks is adopted, i.e. approximately 95% overlapped. H eavy overlapping is expected to alleviate the problem of time-dom ain misalignment. In the above case, the displacement between the query fragment and those original items will be no more than half the hop size, i.e. 1/2 granule will be the wo rst case. Figure 4 shows an illustration of the mechanism: for an original compressed bit stream, H ( i ) of the ( i + 1 ) th block (the whole block length is unable to be depicted due to space limitation). The hop size is 1 granule (95% overlap), e.g. A + B ( A = B here). By reason of the time-domain desynchronization caused by random cropping etc, the input query example is scarcely possible to be exactly aligned to H ( i ) or H ( i + 1 ). When the query fragment lies on the left of the dashed line, for example QH ( j ), it resembles H ( i ) more; while when it lies when the query fragment happens to lies in the middle, i.e. half of the hop size, it comes to the worst synchronization situation. We hope that a suitably designed audi o fingerprint with statistical characteristics will only be slightly or even not changed under this scope of misalignment. 
MP3 encoded bit stream is divided into many frames, which are the basic processing unit in dec oding. Each frame is further subdivided into two independent gr anules, each with 576 values. If a granule is encoded using a long window, these values represent 576 frequency lines whic h are equally assigned into 32 subbands. That is, each subband includes 18 frequency lines. If a granule is compressed via a shor t window, these values only stand for 192 frequency lines and each line includes 3 values that belong to three consecutive window s respectively, see Figure 5. 
Figure 5. Distribution of MDCT coefficients in long-and 
Granule grouping makes any block a mixture of long-window type of and short-window type of granules, the former are usually in the majority and the latter in the minority. In order to calculate the MDCT spectral entropy, the original frequency distribution of long and short windows must be rearranged to achieve approximately the same frequen cy resolution. For long-window cases, we group every three consecutive MDCT coefficients of one granule into a new value, which is equal to the mean of the absolute value of the original three MDCT coefficients considering that MDCT coefficients may be positive or negative, see formula (3). For short-window cases, we substitute the original three MDCT values belonging to different windows at the same frequency line with the mean of their absolute value, see formula (4). In this way, all MDCT values in a granule are uniformly divided into 192 new frequency lines for both long-and short-window cases, this forms th e basis for further processing. where s ( i , n ) is the original MDCT coefficient in the i n frequency line for the long-window cases; s m ( i , j ) is the original MDCT coefficient in the i th granule, j th frequency line, m window for the short-window cases; sn l ( i , j ) and sn new MDCT value in the i th granule, j th frequency line for the long-and short-window cases, respectively. 
After time-domain granule grouping and the definition of new frequency lines, MDCT coefficien ts between the process of reordering and alias reduction of decoding are extracted for further processing. In MPEG Laye r-3 compressed bit stream, most of the 576 MDCT coefficients in a granule are fed into a set of scale-factor bands, each band covers several coefficients and approximates certain critical band. The number of scale-factor bands depends on the sampling rate and the window type used in encoding. Granules using short window usually correspond to music edges such as transients or percussive instruments that are most crucial to auditory percepti on, therefore we divide the above newly defined 192 frequency lines into 9 subbands which cover the main frequency spectrum of popular music in terms of the scale-factor bands defined for s hort windows, as shown in Table 1. subband 
With the above preparation, we first calculate the sub-band energy of the i th block j th new subband, each block includes 22 granules in this research. Then the PMF like ratio between the j subband energy and the sum of all subbands in the same block is approximately computed as shown in formula (5) and (6), where sn(m, n) denotes the n th new MDCT coefficient in the m granule, MDCTT j and MDCTB j represent the top and bottom index of MDCT coefficients which belong to the j respectively, and N block is used to indicate the maximum granule number of the input query example or original recordings stored in the database. 
Finally, the entropy of the i th block is calculated in terms of formula (7) and the fingerprint se quence is obtained by comparing the magnitude of entropy between two adjacent blocks as shown in formula (8). This method is equivalent to a two-level quantization, maintaining the relative relationship regardless of the detailed magnitude. In this wa y, the final fingerprint sequence of ones and zeros will be not only more robust but also more convenient for fingerprint matching. 
In section 2, we have demonstrated the invariance of this proposed compressed-domain spectral entropy under various time-frequency audio distortions through some experiments. Herein we will derive from a simplified theoretical way that H (i), the MDCT spectral entropy of P (i, j) in a block, has approximately the same stability with the variance of P (i, j). Based on the intuitive experience of human auditory perception, there are always more and stronger notes distributed in the mid-frequency range than in the high and low frequency regions. Therefore, energy of MDCT coefficients sn ( i , j ) and derived P ( i , j ) in each block should reflect this phenomenon and can be approximately modeled with Gaussian distribution. Let the mean and variance of P ( i  X  j ) be  X   X  extending to  X   X  ( P (i, j)=0, ] 8 , 0 [  X  j )  X  we have 
Obviously, for P (i, j) of the i -th block, its entropy and variance are in the same magnitude of order. It is known that variance is a typical statistic reflecting the overall fluctuation of random data, it will keep almost invariant unl ess undergoes str ong distortions. From this point of view, the stability of the entropy based compressed-domain fingerprint is also demonstrated. The emphasis of this paper is taking compressed-domain MDCT spectral entropy as the key feature for audio fingerprint deriving. As demonstrated above and in section 2, such kind of feature is rather stable under common audio signal distortions and slight time-domain misalignment like  X 2% time-scale modifications. By further modeling with the fault tolerant big and small relationship between entropy of successive blocks, the steadiness of derived fingerprints is further reinforced. Therefore, by right of the power of the stable fingerprint, we can adopt a relatively straightforward yet effective measure, i.e. Hamming distance, to perform exhaustive matching between the query example and those stored recordings. An illustration of the matching procedure is shown in Figure 6. To explain more clearly, let { x 1 , x 2 , ... , x n } be the input query fingerprint sequence which belongs to the k -th song, } ,..., , { 2 1 i fingerprint sequence of the i-th song (  X  X  X  ), N song be the number of songs stored in the database, then the minimum bit error rate (BER) of matching within a song is denoted as formula (9). The total number of comparison within the database is  X 1 X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X 
Given a reasonable false positiv e rate (FPR), the threshold T of bit error rate can be derive d from both theoretical and experimental ways to indicate under what condition a match can be viewed as true. Let BER(i  X  ) be the ascending reordered form of BER(i) , namely BER(1  X  ) &lt; BER(2  X  ) &lt; BER(3  X  ) &lt; BER(4 &lt; BER(N song  X  ) in which ) ) ( ( min arg ' 1 T i BER deemed as the song that is most similar to the input query fragment, associated metadata like lyric is often returned to users in real software systems. Remember that k means the number of the original song from which the query is excerpted, the overall retrieval result is summarized in formula (10). 
To test the proposed algorithm, we first set up a music database composed of 1822 distinct MP3 popular songs and a corresponding fingerprint database based on the procedures in section 3. Each song is mono, 30 seconds long, sampled at 44.1 kHz and compressed at 64 kbps, with a fingerprint sequence of 2280 bits long. To achieve a good tradeoff among fingerprint granularity, robustness and efficien cy, we experimentally use 100 pieces of 5s-long audio signals as the query examples, which are composed of excerpts cut from sele cted database songs and their distorted copies. Each query example has a fingerprint of 366 bits. 
Since we use BER as the metric to test fingerprint similarity (discrimination) and robustness, we have to first determine a reasonable threshold T based on the desired false positive rate (FPR) in real applications. It is insignificant to claim the robustness without taking FPR into consideration. For a query fingerprint and an equal-length pa rt of a stored fingerprint, they are judged as similar in an audito ry perceptual sense if the bit error rate is below the threshold T . Theoretical analysis on bit error rate has been studied in the literature, for example [1, 13]. However, this approach relies on the assumption that fingerprint bits are random i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) and error bits can be further modeled by normal distribution. This is unfortunately not the case in reality due to the relevance incurred by large overlap between contiguo us blocks. Therefore, we go through an experimental way to determine the BER threshold. For example, in experiment we exhaustively calculate the bit error rate of all possible pairs between 11 input distorted fingerprint sequence and those different fingerprints stored in database, obtaining 7951408 results as show n in Figure 7. Given a specific bit error rate as the threshold, we can count the number of falsely matched queries and then calculate the false positive rate. Some results are listed in Table 2, where we can see that FPRs corresponding to most thresholds are acceptable in practice, then which threshold is most appropriate? Figure 7. BER distribution of fingerprint pairs threshold 0.3000 1.2576e-007 0.3400 3.5968e-005 0.3100 3.7729e-007 0.3500 1.0350e-004 0.3200 2.7668e-006 0.3600 2.5970e-004 0.3300 1.0187e-005 0.3700 6.8969e-004 
To help this selection, we di d some experiments from another point of view to investigate the relationship between top-1 identification precision and the BER threshold T as shown in Figure 8. It can be seen that the change of T (0.30~0.37) doesn X  X  affect the identification performance under common audio signal distortions, while it shows obvious influence on the identification results under time-scale modificat ions. The precision lines under TSM (the lowest th ree lines) go upwards slowly and monotonously when T increases from 0.30 to 0.33 and hereafter keep horizontal. That is, thresholds bigger than 0.33 doesn X  X  contribute to the identification precision any more. 
Generally speaking, bigger BE R threshold will give better robustness results and meanwhil e make the performance of false positive rate worse. To balance these two aspects, we adopt 0.33 as the BER threshold in this paper. Its corresponding FPR equals 1.0187e-005 that is fairish for practical audio identification applications 
To simulate the real world interfe rence, we apply various audio signal operations on the compressed input query example using audio editing tools Cool edit an d Gold wave. By their processing procedures to MP3 audio, the simulation is actually equivalent to decoding plus random cut plus audio signal processing plus recompression. Given 100 randomly chosen query excerpts and 0.33 as the BER threshold, the top-1, 5 and 10 retrieval performance of this proposed algorithm under various a udio distortions are averaged and shown in Figure 9. It can be seen that this MDCT entropy-based fingerprint shows very good identification precision, even under severe audio signal distor tions like lossy compression of MP3@32kbps-64kbps, volume modulation, obvious echo addition (100ms, 50%), noise interference with the signal noise ratio (SNR) as low as 15dB, equalization with a 10-band equalizer, band-pass filtering from 200 to 6000 Hz, tempo-reserved pitch shifting up to  X 10% and sli ght pitch-reserved time-scale modifications at  X 2%. In the above cases, the averaged top-1 precision results are all over 80% and top-5 over 90%. Overall, the robustness under various audio signal distortions is pretty good. The only blemish is that th e top-1 result under TSM@-3% is not very satisfying with only 42% averaged precision, inferior by comparison with those state-of-the-art uncompressed-domain algorithms such as [4] and [5] which can resist TSM up to  X 15% and -21% -+26% respectively. The weakness of compressed-domain algorithms is essentially caused by the fixed data structure of the MP3 compressed bit stream. In this case, implicit synchronization methods based on salient local regions like in [30] can X  X  be applied. The only way to resist serious time-domain desynchronization is to increase the overlap between contagious blocks and design more steady fi ngerprints, whereas the overlap has an upper limit of 100% (95% has been used in this paper) and discovering more powerful features is neither an easy work. 
Compared with other related compressed-domain algorithms introduced in the introduction [8, 9, 10, 11] whose best top-5 precision rate is 90% [10] under a clean environment (no experimental results under any time-frequency distortions are reported in the above papers), our algorithm obviously outperforms those methods with th e top-5 precision rates bigger than 90% even under severe audi o signal distortions such as MP3@32kbps-64kbps, 10-band equalization, pitch shifting up to  X 10% etc and the challenging time-scale modifications up to  X 2% as shown in Figure 8. With respect to reference [13], to the authors X  knowledge it is the only one published compressed-domain algorithm with some robustness reports including MP3@64Kbps, reverberation, echo, down sampling and equalization. However, it doesn X  X  show any results against the two most challenging audio distorti ons, i.e. tempo-reserved pitch shifting and pitch-reserved time-scale modification, as we do in this paper. What is more important, the crucial parameter in audio identification, i.e. granularity, is not considered in any of the above algorithms. That is, they are not actually working in the way of fragment retrieval, this is an intrinsic deficiency compared with our method. Overall, this proposed method not only outperforms other existing compressed-domain audio retrieval systems, but also comes close to many state-of-the-art uncompressed domain algorithms for example [1, 4, 5, 6] in terms of robustness under common audio si gnal distortions except that results under serious time-scale modi fications are worse due to the inability to use time-domain im plicit synchronization method. 
Figure 9. Retrieval results under various time-frequency 
In this paper, we propose a novel compressed-domain audio fingerprinting algorithm for MP3 popu lar music identification. In virtue of the short-time steady property of MDCT spectral entropy and large overlap, a 5s query excerpt is shown being able to achieve promising results on r obustness and retrieval precision rates under various time-frequency audio signal distortions including the challenging pitch shifting and time-scale modification. For future work, designing more statistically stable compressed-domain features and combining with this MDCT entropy-based feature using information fusion will be our main approaches to improve the retrieval precision and robustness against large time-domain misalignment. Cover song identification performed right on the compressed-domain is our final aim to be accomplished.
