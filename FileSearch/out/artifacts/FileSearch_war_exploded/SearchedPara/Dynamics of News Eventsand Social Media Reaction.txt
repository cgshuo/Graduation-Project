 The analysis of social sentiment expressed on the Web is beco ming increasingly relevant to a variety of applications, and it i simportant to understand the underlying mechanisms which drive the evolution of sentiments in one way or another, in order to be able to pred ict these changes in the future. In this paper, we study the dynam ics of news events and their relation to changes of sentiment expre ssed on relevant topics. We propose a novel framework, which models the behavior of news and social media in response to events as a con-volution between event X  X  importance and media response fun ction, specific to media and event type. This framework is suitable f or detecting time and duration of events, as well as their impac tand dynamics, from time series of publication volume. These dat acan greatly enhance events analysis; for instance, they can hel pdistin-guish important events from unimportant, or predict sentim ent and stock market shifts. As an example of such application, we ex -tracted news events for a variety of topics and then correlat ed this data with the corresponding sentiment time series, revealing the connection between sentiment shifts and event dynamics.
The problem of monitoring the evolution of sentiment has bee n studied in the context of different research areas, from soc ial stud-ies to reputation management [13]. However, there is still a lack of understanding of what causes the crowd X  X  sentiment to change. Some people change their attitude for personal reasons, som edo so influenced by their connections, but most likely people ch ange their opinion when a new evidence comes into their considera tion.
By aggregating sentiments, expressed in multiple texts, an das-sessing the result with statistical measurements, we can ca pture certain changes, or shifts, in global sentiment, which cann ot be attributed to random variation [12]. Understanding the rea sons for these sentiment shifts provides insight about products ,services and policies to companies and institutions. Thus, this prob lem has gained a lot of attention in academia and industry [16, 10, 4, 7].
In this paper, we propose studying the correlation of import ant shifts in sentiment to news events reported by different new ssources. The objective of this paper is to exploit the current work on s enti-ment analysis and contradiction detection, and extend the s tate of the art by understanding news events dynamics and modeling r ela-tionships between sentiment changes and news events .

We observe that most news events are announced as atomic piec es of information and their impact is not readily intelligible from the text alone. To determine the importance and impact of news to peo-ple, it is crucial to consider the publication dynamics of th ewhole crowd, rather than only from news agencies or news media [10] . Analyzing the aggregated publication volume or user intere st on a specific topic over time can help in understanding the event X  sim-portance and dynamics. Earlier detection of such events can be use-ful to publishers, content providers and search engines [9] .How-ever, in certain cases social media can contribute to this vo lume all by themselves (without any external stimuli, such as a news e vent coming from a news agency) and also maintain a trending volum e growth over long time periods. These effects distract the ob served events dynamics and may even make them undetectable.

Our method addresses these problems by representing public a-tion dynamics as the result of the interplay between the original news X  importance and social response. More specifically, ou rmod-eling is based on the idea that news media (or social media) ca n be described by a special  X  X esponse X  function, which determ ines the resulting dynamics of news publication (or user interest) for an event. This opens up the possibility of recovering the origi nal event sequence and its varying importance over the time dimension .
The response function can be seen as a likelihood of a  X  X elaye d X  publication for an event: similar to a phone conversation, where a Figure 1: An example time series, with sentiment shifts (top ) correlated to news volume (mid) and events importance (bott om).
Figure 2: Some of the events identified by our system for  X  X Pad  X . delay in circuits creates the  X  X cho X  effect, news and social media tend to re-publish, cite, and discuss previous articles, extending this activity over time. In this case, the peak intensity of publi cations does not always coincide with the beginning of the event, or i ts peak importance. To tackle these problems and recover the or iginal event importance, we employ deconvolution, which is a popul ar technique for improving audio or image quality [3].

Based on this method, we are able to accurately measure event s importance and response dynamics, opening up the possibility to evaluate their impact on sentiment evolution. The results o btained by our study indicate the existence of different types of response dynamics in Twitter, and reveal their impact on sentiment ch anges.
We would like to make the reader more familiar with our goals by introducing the following use cases.

Example 1: Consider a search interest [9] time series extracted from Google for the topic  X  X Pad X , shown in Figure 2, blue. It f ea-tures a growing number of search queries overlaid with a seri es of overlapping bursts of user interest, making it very hard to d etect news events. The output time series (Figure 2, red), process ed us-ing our method, demonstrates a more vivid event separation a nd dynamics, making them easily detectable. Moreover, the output time series appears without the global trend, which is proce ssed alongside the deconvolution. We note, that achieving the sa me ef-fect is not possible by subtracting a moving average or by usi ng linear regression, since the presence of peaks in time serie sbiases the trend estimation.

Example 2: It is known, that response dynamics is often deter-mined by events, and can be used to classify events by their im pact and expectedness [2, 5]. For example, in the time series show nin Figure 3, we see that the death of Michael Jackson was so impac t-ing to media, that their response lasted for over a year. On th econ-trary, the interest to Harry Potter movies has usually a two-month period of decay. Moreover, we observe that these events have dif-ferent decay patterns (we further discuss this point later i nthepa-per). Our method has been designed to detect and analyze different response dynamics, making suitable for cases like the above . Example 3: Since its early announcement, Samsung X  X   X  X alaxy Tab X  was regarded in social media as a very fine competitor to A p-ple X  X   X  X Pad X , receiving mostly positive sentiments. Howev er, the attitude of people dramatically changed to negative at the m oment when Samsung published the price for the device. By observin g the media reaction to these and other impacting news, it beco mes possible to predict changes in their opinion more rapidly, i .e., as soon as we are able to recognize the establishing trend dynam ics. Figure 3: Dynamics of Google Search volume for different top ics. Extracted event importance is shown as triangles (normaliz ed).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that propos es a principled modeling of news dynamics in various media and ne ws interaction with sentiments. Our main contributions are su mma-rized as follows.
Since our framework relies on deconvolution, it can accommo -date various response functions, suitable for different ca ses. We note that our method does not require describing the news pub lica-tion dynamics using a differential equation. Moreover, it i spossible to automatically learn media response functions from the data.
We summarize the most important notations used in our paper in Table 1 and discuss them in Section 2.1. Following that, we introduce our problems in Section 2.2.
We are given a time series of numeric values, s ( t ) ,whichisde-rived from raw sentiments S ( t ) for a particular topic T and repre-sents some sentiment feature or interestingness measure, e .g., con-tradiction level [15]. These time series are shown in Figure 1(top), where s ( t ) represents the contradiction level of raw sentiments S ( t ) . Along with the sentiment time series, we are given the news fr e-quency time series represented by n ( t ) (Figure 1, middle), and the corresponding correlation function  X  ( s , n ) ,whichtakesbothtime series as input parameters and computes a real-valued corre lation coefficient. We note that  X  ( s , n ) can be a special function adapted for particular measures used to compute s ( t ) and n ( t ) .Forinstance, n ( t ) can be a rather bursty time series, where the notions of mean value and deviations from the mean make no apparent physical sense. Thus, it can be more effective in this case to consider a correlation measure based on derivatives, or on bursts alig nment. Finally, we use the event importance time series e ( t ) to model event dynamics, and response functions rf ( t ) and mrf ( t ) (represented in Figure 1, bottom) to model social and news media behavior. We describe these functions in more detail in Section 3.
We are given a collection of sentiment feature time series s ( t ) and news volume time series n ( t ) for various topics. For a par-ticular topic T ,wewanttodetectthemostimportantsentiment shifts according to s ( t ) ,andidentifythenewsevents,whichhave caused them, so that it will be possible to predict future sen timent changes on that topic upon observing and analyzing relevant news events. This general problem can be decomposed into a set of s ub-problems with the scopes of news-sentiment interaction and news-events interaction respectively.

News and sentiments interaction can be coarsely modeled by c or-relation. However, the problem of finding dependencies betw een sentiments and news is inherently complex, since sentiment shifts may be correlated not only with the news on the same topic, but also with several other (related) topics.

After determining a substantial amount of news events, whic h caused sentiment changes, it may be possible to predict shif ts in sentiment for related topics by extracting features of the r ecognized event and using them as input to a classifier model. Related to pics can be determined by referring to the list of news time series ,which are correlated with the given sentiment time series. The cla ssifier model can be trained on a dataset of confirmed causality cases be-tween news events and sentiment shifts. Alternatively, it c an use automatically extracted correlation pairs. We note that th is prob-lem requires a deeper study with complex causality modeling ,and we defer it to a future study. In this paper, our goal is to expl ore the event dynamics in different media, and establish the con nection between events and sentiment shifts.
There exist approaches that tackle specific aspects of our pr ob-lem in various domains, yet, they cannot be combined to solve the problem that our approach solves. In this section, we provid eade-tailed evaluation of their properties and design principle s, and use it to establish a theoretical and empirical background for our method.
To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no other syst em, or method, capable of automatically detecting impacting ev ents and identifying properties of their dynamics from news publica tion vol-ume. There exist only few news tracking methods which are abl e to recognize different event types, but neither of them provides nu-meric characteristics useful for event modeling and sentim ent pre-diction purposes, such as a correct time framing and importance level of an event. Still, they are not capable of distinguish ing adja-cent events when their publications are highly overlapping .Finally, the existing dynamics models target only individual news pr opaga-tion media (e.g., blogosphere, microblogging, youtube), a nd have not been generalized (or tested) on multiple domains.
Lehmann et al. [5] study collective attention in Twitter and its propagation through user networks. They measure the aggreg ated volume before, during and after the event X  X  peak by subtract ing the baseline level of attention (computed using a sliding wi ndow). Based on the relationship between these three values, they d efine four classes of news events according to their expectedness and impact. Accordingly, events can be: a) expected impacting ,where there is a growth of volume before an event (anticipation) an da decay afterwards (response); b) expected non-impacting ,wherethe event X  X  outcome is of a lesser concern than the event itself; c) un-expected impacting ,featuringaninstantappearanceandalengthy response; d) unexpected non-impacting or transient ,whereneither the event nor its outcome are important to the media;
Alternatively, Crane and Sornette [2] consider events as ha ving internal ( endogenous ), or external ( exogenous )origin,andbeing of either critical ,or sub-critical importance to social media. We observe that exogenous critical and exogenous sub-critical event types in their classification coincide with unexpected impacting and unexpected non-impacting event types from [5]. In addition, the authors also introduce a concept of endogenous events, which is broadly similar to memes in social media.

While these classes capture events semantics on a very good level, a more detailed analysis of news dynamics requires reliable extraction of peak shapes and proper modeling of social medi a. The first requirement is important since publication volume oft en con-tains noise and (evolving) background level, which masks in divid-ual peaks. The second requirement is necessary to distingui sh be-tween the volume generated by endogenous factors (imitatio n) and that generated by exogenous factors (news importance). The refore, we investigate the most recent models of news dynamics and th eir ability to correctly describe and predict news volume.
Memes in social media are the outbursts of publications on so me topic, which can be assigned to the  X  X ndogenous critical X  ty pe of the above classification. Since they have no particular exte rnal driv-ing force or impact on sentiment, we want to distinguish them from  X  X xpected impacting X  events. The topic of news dynamics in s ocial media (and memes in particular) was studied by Leskovec et al .[6], who propose a model of meme and news dynamics based on three assumptions for the interaction of news sources: imitation , recency preference and concurrency .Theimitation(endogenous)hypothe-sis assumes that news sources are more likely to publish on ev ents that have already seen large volume of publications. The rec ency hypothesis marks the tendency to publish more on recent even ts. Finally, the concurrency hypothesis states that news sourc es have a limited capacity and choose only one event at a time to report on. The authors express the imitation and recency preferences t hrough the functions of a combined news volume, f ( x ) ,andtimepassed since the beginning,  X  ( t ) : In the above equation, dx / dt represents the amount of publications at time t ,and x represents the total amount integrated since the beginning. We note that whereas equation (1) is based on the a s-sumptions given in [6], it is different to the equation studied in that paper, where x + dx / dt were mistakenly used as n ( t ) 1
Leskovec et al. demonstrate that in the simulated environme nt consisting of concurrent news sources, both time and volume com-ponents are necessary to generate the oscillating nature of news vol-ume. However, repeating this experiment with the original m eme time series revealed a substantial deviation between predi cted and observed volumes, when the same assumptions (namely, globa l time and volume) were used. First, the global volume (accumu -lated since the beginning of the time series) is not useful to predict any but the very first peak. Second, the global time (either fr om the beginning of the time series or from the first peak) is both arbitrary (which peak is the first? when a time series begins?) and can no t capture subsequent peaks. This said, we assume that the auth ors implied the global nature of their model with respect to para me-ters, while the time and the volume were local for every seede d event. Nevertheless, we believe that equation (1) intuitiv ely cap-tures some of the properties of news dynamics, and is therefo re worth considering.
Asur et al. [1] propose a model for news dynamics, described by stochastic multiplicative process, driven by independent random variables (noise) and a time-decaying variable (recency). Based on this model, they predict a linear initial growth of publicat ions vol-ume, and a log-normal distribution of this volume over different time series. Both hypotheses are supported by an empirical e valua-tion on Twitter [1] and Digg [17] data. However, this model is not useful for prediction purposes, since it relies on a mixture of ran-dom variables (located at subsequent time intervals). Even though it is possible to infer values of these variables for past tim einter-vals, the hypothesis that they are independently distribut ed forbids estimation of subsequent variables.

Acloserlookatthismodelrevealsthatitisformulatedinar e-cursive manner, where the total volume accumulated by a time tick t + dt is expressed through the volume at time t ,i.i.d.randomvari-able  X  ( t ) and time-decaying component  X  ( t ) : To analyze the proposed dynamics, the above equation can be t rans-formed into a more convenient form (remember though, that dx / dt , x and t remain discrete): Now it can be clearly seen that the volume of news published at time t depends on the previously accumulated volume x ,discounted by  X  ( t ) ,andonrandomvariable  X  ( t ) .Althoughthedependency of (3) on random variables forbids its analytical derivation, we ob-serve that it is very similar to (1), and can also be represent ed as the product of exponent and time factors, especially in the case when  X  ( t ) are not i.i.d.

Another important observation in favor of the continuity of  X  ( t ) is that these variables may represent an exogenous factor, t he news importance e ( t ) ,whichpushesvolumeupandcounteractsthede-creasing trend of  X  ( t ) .Comparing(1)and(3)underthisperspec-tive, it becomes evident that they are essentially the speci fic cases of a more general model, multiplying endogenous and exogenous factors. Our model differs from these two by considering a co nvo-lution between endogenous and exogenous factors.
Astudyofsocialsystem X  X dynamicsbyCraneandSornette[2] comes the closest to our work with regard to a modeling based on user response. The authors study dynamics of book sales [8 ] and social content [2], based on a widespread model of hyperb olic (long-memory) user response function rf ( t )  X  1 / t 1 +  X  Taking the ensemble average of a Hawkes Poisson Process driv en by this response function and a spontaneous rate e ( t ) ,theyexpress n ( t ) conditional on itself and on an average branching ratio  X  : Correspondingly, equation (4) takes the form of the convolu tion between event importance e ( t ) and a media response kernel mr f ( t ) , considered as the output of (4) in the case when e ( t )=  X  ( t ) :
Figure 4: Interaction between key components of the system.
Summarizing the above studies, we see that the imitation fac tor does not play as important role in news dynamics as in meme dy-namics. Moreover, [1] and [5] observe that propagation of ne ws through user networks is not epidemic, i.e., it rather depen ds on news importance than on numbers of followers of users who spr ead the news. Therefore, we consider publication likelihood being de-pendent more on recent volume than on past volume, deviating from the purely endogenous model. In addition, we consider t hat news events have continuity and varying importance, which a lso affect the publishing dynamics (exogenous assumption). These as-sumptions require a more complex modeling of news dynamics, but result in more accurate models, which we discuss in the follo wing sections.
Our task requires processing two different kinds of data, i. e., sen-timents and news volume, which come from different sources a nd also at very different rates. In Figure 4, we show the overall ar-chitecture of our system by dividing its major components in to two main layers: News Layer and Sentiment Layer .

In the News layer, we aggregate the volume of the news for a topic into a time series, which will be further analyzed to detect news events. To detect a news event and extract its features w eper-form a deconvolution of news volume time series (or its fragm ent).
The Sentiments layer aggregates sentiments over time for a spe-cific topic, and detects interesting changes, which can be co ntradic-tions, outbursts of sentiments X  volume, or other situation s.
As we already noted, not every kind of publications outburst sis caused by external news. For instance,  X  X ndogenous critica l X  and  X  X xpected impacting X  events may produce a similar response in so-cial media, yet only the latter one is relevant to our study. M ore-over, not every kind of news dynamics has an impact on sentime nt, so we want to distinguish them at a fine level of detail.
Following these observations, we introduce our model for so cial media and news dynamics. We start with the description of bas ic social media responses and our representation of event impo rtance. Then, we introduce a novel method to extract important prope rties of events, which is based on deconvolution, and propose methods to estimate the parameters for this process. We model the observed news dynamics (frequency of publicati ons) as a response of social media to external stimuli. We represe nt the output as a convolution of two functions: the news events impor-tance sequence and the media response function: where mrf ( t ) is the media response function (in general, decaying), and e ( t ) is the actual event sequence, which is unobserved. We depict these functions in Figure 1, bottom.

However, in order to recover the original event sequence, we need to perform a deconvolution of news frequency time serie s, for which we should know the exact shape of mrf ( t ) .Tomodelthe behavior of media, we propose using a family of normalized de cay-ing functions, which have the aggregated volume equal to 1 . 0and which are defined on t &gt; 0usingtheHeavisidestepfunction h ( t ) . For instance, these functions can be linear , hyperbolic or exponen-tial ,asdemonstratedinFigure5andformalizedbelow.
We note, that linear response has the shortest effect and hyp er-bolic response has the longest effect on time series if we con sider comparable values of decay time  X  0 ,whichtakesonarolesimilar to the half-life of radiation decay.

We consider decaying response functions, because news even ts become obsolete and cease being published very soon after th eir appearance. Another possible explanation for this phenome non is the saturation of content providers: the likelihood (the te mporal rate) of news publication in the absence of events activity i sin-versely dependent on the number of news, which have been prev i-ously published. Moreover, the shapes of response function scon-vey additional information regarding impact and expectabi lity of events, and also reveal properties of the media.
 Linear Response (7). In the case of a linear response, the probabil-ity of publishing on an event linearly decreases with time, a nd the media cease publishing after a finite cutoff time  X  0 .Linearresponse is characterized by a constant rate of content generation, a nd results in nearly linear dynamics of news volume for spike event shap es. We are interested in evaluating it since this kind of dynamic swas observed by [1] for event buildups.
 Exponential Response (9). For the exponential response, the rate of decline is proportional to the current probability value at any moment, hence the decay is initially more rapid than the line ar, but becomes less pronounced towards the end, with the probab ility reaching 0 in an infinite time.
 Hyperbolic Response (8). In the case of hyperbolic (power law) response, the probability follows a more pronounced decay c om-pared to exponential (the decay rate is usually quadratic to the cur-rent value). It decreases very rapidly when the time  X  is small, but has a heavy tail afterwards. Here, parameters  X  &gt; 1and  X  trol the sharpness of a response. The hyperbolic response is very interesting since its amplitude can reach infinity in a const ant time (unlike the exponential) and in the case of  X   X  1itsrateofdecline is proportional to the square of its current value.
 Symmetric and Asymmetric Responses. Aside from being im-pacting or non-impacting, events can be anticipated or unexpected. These properties of events manifest themselves through the ob-served response of the media. For instance, unexpected even ts will have no buildup of volume preceding the event (consider earth-quakes), and expected non-impacting events will have abrup tde-cay of volume upon their end (consider football finals). Ther efore,
Figure 5: Media response functions and their frequency doma in. response functions for a particular event can be either asymmetric (Figure 5, top), featuring only buildup or only decay, or symmetric , featuring both sides, not necessarily of the same shape (Fig ure 5, middle). Both types are important to recognize, since they a llow to reason about events semantics.
We model events by using a piecewise linear approximation of event importance e ( t ) .Thismodelintroducesasetofmeaningful parameters, that can succinctly describe event importance ,namely, buildup and decay rates, longitude of an event and its maximum im-portance level. We show the most basic shapes of event importance in Figure 1 (bottom) and describe them below. Accordingly, t here are rectangular (Event 2) and triangular (Events 1 and 3) models, which can also merge to trapezoid-like shapes (Event 3 X ). The Rectangular model of e ( t ) is suitable for long-duration events with roughly constant importance and coverage, like  X  X lymp ics X . This model is represented using a step function with the cons tant height of n 0 and the longitude  X  e : e ( t )= n 0 , 0  X  t  X   X  The Triangular model adds the parameters of buildup a and decay b ,when e ( t ) is of varying importance to mass media during its period. Accordingly, we can represent it using a piecewise l inear function, which originates at time t = 0, and reverses its direction at t = t 0 : e ( t )= at , 0  X  t  X  t 0 ; e ( t )=( a + b ) t We show the shapes of the resulting news functions in Figure 6 . In this example, we used news events of three different longi tudes (  X  e =0 . 25, 0 . 5and1 . 0day)andselectedtheparametersofresponse functions so that n ( t ) would reach the same amplitude after 0 . 5 days for an event with a constant importance (as can be seen in the second event). We observe that a varying time length of event sin this model results in varying sharpness of news frequency pe aks. Correspondingly, short-time events have a shorter period o factu-ation and long-time events eventually result in the saturat ion of news media. In all cases, the period of relaxation of news med ia is mainly characterized by the shape of the corresponding me dia response function.

According to our model, the height of the event on the event se -quence e ( t ) indicates its importance, while the length describes its longitude. Events can be of constant importance, like those shown in Figure 6 (left side), or of varying importance, shown in Fi gure 6 (right side). In both cases, the time longitude as well as the maxi-mum importance can be different for different events even fo rthe same topic. Figure 6: Convolution of rectangular and triangular event m odels. Deconvolution is the opposite process to convolution [3]. W ith this procedure we are able to recreate the original event importance se-quence, as shown in Figure 1, bottom. Moreover, deconvolution helps to detect and separate nearby, but distinct events, wh ich may otherwise be considered as a single event due to their overlap.
However, deconvolution can be expressed in the functional f orm only for a limited number of response functions (e.g. exponential, linear), while our framework is designed to support any kind of finite integrable functions. Therefore, we take an approach to de-convolution, which relies on the frequency domain of the sig nals, as explained below.

The Convolution theorem states, that the Fourier transform ation of a time-domain convolution of two series is equal to the mul tipli-cation of their Fourier transformations in the frequency do main: According to this equation, for every cyclic frequency  X  ,wecan obtain Fourier coefficients e (  X  ) of the original series e ( t ) by di-viding Fourier coefficients of the observed series n ( t ) by the corre-sponding coefficients of the response function mr f ( t ) .Duringthis process, we can also remove global trends from the time serie sby lowering the values of low-frequency components. Finally, we ob-tain a time-domain representation of e ( t ) by performing an inverse Fourier transformation:
In this paper, we use the analytical Fourier representation sof the three example response functions considered in our fram ework, although it is possible to use numerically-computed Fourie rcoeffi-cients of any arbitrary decay function (symmetric or asymmetric).
Our method is also able to distinguish between symmetric and asymmetric mr f ( t ) ,andusetheappropriateonefordeconvolution. For instance, let X  X  consider the differences between the tw omodels for the  X  X olar Eclipse X  event from Twitter, illustrated in F igure 7. In the left part of the figure, we observe that the main event (s hown in red) has a duration of one day, and was also discussed the da y after (when photos were published). The symmetric deconvolution was able to extract these parameters and correctly match (gr een color) the observed volume of publications (blue color). Fo rthe asymmetric deconvolution, shown on the right, if we conside ronly the decay part of mr f ( t ) ,weendupwiththeincorrectestimation of event X  X  time and duration and also less correct predictio nofthe volume (green color, right side). Figure 7: Symmetric (expected) and asymmetric (unexpected ) response functions applied to  X  X olar Eclipse X  event from Twitter.
Deconvolution with small decay parameters is fail-safe and loss-less as long as event shapes are not approximated or event imp or-tance is not becoming negative. However, only a high level of deconvolution helps to recover the original event importan ce, and to represent its dynamics using the desired model. Since hig her than necessary deconvolution may result in smaller events b ecom-ing outcast by a  X  X hade X  from their preceding larger neighbo rs, we need to apply the largest possible, but still adequate level of decon-volution, using the parameter estimation as described belo w.
Aconventionalmethodforestimatingparametersofrespons e functions relies on observing event decay shapes under the a ssump-tion that events are singular in time (i.e., they can be repre sented by Dirac X  X  delta function). Parameter estimation in this ca se can be done by regression parameter fitting, following the peak det ection and extraction of their slopes. First, we normalize the asce nding or descending slopes of time series and then analyze them using either linear, power-law or exponential regression. Next, we take the average of the extracted parameters across the peaks, weighting them by regression error and level of importance.

Nevertheless, regression fitting can only be achieved for a f ew known response functions. In order to learn the parameters o f any response function, we propose to optimize them over the fitne ss of our model for the entire time series (of news volume for a spec ific topic). A direct measure of fitness can be computed by averagi ng fitting errors of piecewise linear regression of event impor tance. However, this measure only improves with more powerful deco n-volution, as more and more events obtain spike shapes, thus d e-feating our purpose. Therefore, we optimize the parameters using residual deconvolution errors, as follows.

First, we perform a deconvolution of n ( t ) using a chosen re-sponse function with an initial set of parameters. Then, we a pprox-imate the resulting time series using a piecewise linear fun ction, obtaining triangular e ( t ) .Followingthat,werepeattheprocessof deconvolution in the opposite way: convolving the approximated series with the same response function. Finally, the output is com-pared to the original time series, and the error of fitting is c alcu-lated. If the error of fitting improves by flipping to asymmetric response function, this type becomes chosen. The whole proc ess repeats until the optimal parameters are identified. It is al so possi-ble to determine the best response function type for every peak and process the corresponding time interval individually. Thi schoice can be based on the best fitness, or on the preferences of the gi ven media and topic. In this paper, we apply deconvolution to the whole time series, to compare different response functions and th estabil-ity of their parameters, leaving per-peak processing for th efuture.
The proposed method is effective for identifying parameter sfor any event models and response functions. It is also efficient thanks to a concave error surface, where for small decay times the er ror is dominated by the event X  X  model approximation, and for lar ge decay times the error is caused by a longer than necessary response. Therefore, we apply gradient descent for estimating parame ters.
In this paper, we are interested in sentiment measures that are sensitive to particular kinds of sentiment changes and that can also be correlated with events. Nevertheless, not many studies p ropose asuitablemeasureforopinionshifts,whichcanbeanalyzed coher-ently with the news time series in order to extract correlati ons. The particular methods which can be adopted to our problem are senti-ment volume [10] and contradiction level [15], discussed below.
We extract texts for a particular topic using the Apache Luce ne index, by querying it for documents that contain a given topi c X  X  keywords. Analyzed texts are first cleaned from markup, such as urls, user names, hashtags, and quotes in the case of tweets. Then, we use the SentiStrength algorithm [11, 10] to extract senti ment polarities of texts. Obtained sentiment labels S are scaled to be in the range [-1;1], and later aggregated as real values.
Thelwall et al. [10] evaluate how twitter sentiment and its v ol-ume are changing before and after news events. By analyzing the peaks in sentiment, they show that the volume of negative sen ti-ment is increasing just before an event, while there is an inc rease of positive sentiment at the event X  X  peak intensity. Their results indicate that external events usually lead to changes in sen timent and, more importantly, increase the contradiction level. O ne more observation made by the same authors is that the changes in sen-timent are particularly small, making it necessary to apply more sophisticated methods for shift detection and properly ali gn these small fluctuations with the underlying news time series.
Sentiment Volume is defined as the amount, or the sum of senti-ments of the same polarity, expressed within a specified time inter-val. It captures bursts of a particular opinion polarity, e. g., positive :
Another suitable measure for sentiment shifts is the sentim ent contradiction level [14, 15], which is based on the first stat istical moments of sentiment values. The intuition behind this meas ure is that when the average sentiment value  X  S is close to zero, while the sentiment variance  X  2 S is high, then the polarization of sentiments is high, indicating contradiction and diversity. Combinin g  X   X 
S in a single formula, the authors propose the following measu re for contradictions: where n is the number of sentiments,  X  &amp; = 0isthenormalizingcon-stant, and W is a weight function that takes into account the sig-nificance of sentiment statistics involved in the calculation [15]. A distinct property of this measure is that it detects both changes of sentiment polarity as well as temporary shifts of sentiments.
We observe that different sentiment and news measures requi re different correlation methods  X  ( s , n ,  X  ) ,whichalsoconsideratime lag between the time series,  X  .Inthecaseofcontinuoustimese-ries, which usually deviate around their average values, we can use the Pearson cross-correlation coefficient, which is defined as the normalized covariance of two time series: Figure 8: Correlated news and sentiment series from Twitter for movie  X  X angover X , where bursts are extracted using deconvo lution.
However, Pearson correlation is intended to determine a linear dependency between variables, which is hardly observable for bursty time series such as unexpected events or sentiment contradi ction. Such time series do not have a definite average level, around w hich the movement is happening. Instead, their values are outbur sting from the minimum level at some points in time. This behavior r e-quires a special correlation technique, which takes as inpu tonlythe bursty points within a specified time interval. Let X  X  assume that sets of bursts for sentiment and news are denoted as S t and N tively. Following this, any kind of binary similarity measu re can be applied, for example cosine similarity  X  C or Jaccard coefficient  X  In the above equations, intersecting bursts are determined accord-ing to some proximity region  X  ,andinadditiontocountingthe number of overlapping bursts, we can apply burst weighting, for example based on their magnitude.

While we can determine bursts of sentiments using simple met h-ods, events require more robust methods, as can be seen in Figure 8, where a group of two (out of three) events in the right part of t he time series are located on the monotonic slope of n ( t ) ,andarenot detectable by thresholds, or by derivative tracking. Remarkably, deconvolution can recover these and other  X  X idden X  events and re-sult in a more accurate correlation. It is also crucial to consider the level of event importance, obtained after the deconvolutio n, rather than the original news volume, as can be seen in Figure 2, wher e iPad 1 and iPad 2 announcements had different importance to p eo-ple (red) but almost the same volume (blue) due to a trend. Thu s, we select n ( t ) peaks by their level of importance, that yields the highest correlation.

We also consider that sentiment changes may be preceded or fo l-lowed by news events with some time lag. In order to align the t wo sequences, we have to determine this time lag, which is diffe rent for different topics and media. Here again, deconvolution h elps identifying correct event timings and, therefore, time lag s. It shifts peaks backwards in time to the extent determined by a respons e function and event dynamics. The optimal time lag  X  can be deter-mined by maximizing the cross-correlation coefficient over arange of positive (reaction) and negative (anticipation) time lags  X  : An unconstrained optimization is inefficient, since it requ ires com-puting correlation for every parameter  X  ,whereasaheuristicopti-mization can produce wrong results, when news time sequence is arepetitiveprocess. Toovercomethis,theabsolutetimela gmust not exceed the first maximum of the news autocorrelation function.
The main goal of our experimental evaluation is to study the properties of the real data and evaluate the proposed and exi sting models and their assumptions. We analyze the news dynamics a nd evaluate our models on several social media datasets with di fferent characteristics. The agenda of our evaluation is the follow ing:
Our Meme dataset [6] consists of the top 100 meme time se-ries 2 and approximately 500 peaks, that represent various events of endogenous nature, which circulated in the blogosphere in t he pe-riod from August 2008 to May 2009. While some of the analyzed memes have a connection to real news events, the largest part of them are just sticky phrases gaining popularity from time to time. The analyzed time series have a granularity of aggregation o f4 hours and varying lengths (typically, one month).

For our Twitter dataset, we selected 30 topics 3 ,whichfeatured the most prominent events for the period of half a year, from J une 2009 till December 2009. The dataset contained approximate ly 7 million tweets in total and over 400 peaks during the events. We extracted time series of volume and sentiments using a 1 day a ggre-gation. Twitter data has very different properties when compared to the output of blogs or news media. First, this platform has a distinct bias towards current events and temporal activity of users. So usually there is no accumulated interest, since any activ ity fades out to zero after a short time. Second, there are different types of dynamics present at the same time: daily activity and trending ac-tivity .Whereasthefirstoneislargelydrivenbyworkschedules in different time zones, the second one demonstrates a more c lear pattern of event interest and is our main subject.

To compare the accuracy of our models for different media, we perform news volume deconvolution using automatically ext racted parameters (as described in Section 4.1.4), and then quanti fy the accuracy of fitting in a way that is comparable across differe nt time series (and across different peak heights). Accordingly, e rrors in fitness are measured as RMSE for every peak, and then normal-ized by its height, so that the results can be averaged and com pared across peaks.
Taking into account our findings in Section 3.2, we used dynam -ics equation (1) to predict the values of every peak by applyi ng it on the volume and time accumulated since the peak X  X  start t ime. Considering the linear form for the imitation factor expressed as f ( x )= a + bx ,and  X  ( t )= t  X   X  (  X  &gt; 1), we have:
In Figure 9 (a) we demonstrate an example prediction of this model in the case when  X  = 3 . 3and bc = 3 . 3. We observe that the first peak X  X  buildup and decay can be matched using these p a-rameters only approximately, while the shapes of all the sub sequent peaks cannot be matched at all. Figure 9:  X  X o way, no how, no McCain!" meme from [6]. Peaks are approximated by meme model [6] using fixed (a) and fitted (b ) parameters, and by deconvolution using fixed parameters (c) .
Fitting equation (1) to individual peaks using least squares re-gression yields much better accuracy for small peaks (Figur e9 (b)), but does not match the sharpest peaks, where buildups a nd decays seem to require different model parameters. In the ab ove experiment, fitting employed four parameters, which were in depen-dent among peaks and had different values for every peak. Two of these parameters are effectively stretching the model to ac commo-date real data: base level ( a )indicatesthevolumeaccumulatedbe-fore the peak, and scale ( b )servesthepurposeoffittingthepeak X  X  height, to counterweight the normalization effect caused b ydivid-ing on volume in equation (1). Normalizing the predicted vol ume over the top 100 time series (the concurrency factor) did not yield any improvement neither for fixed, nor for individually fitte dpeak parameters. This can either indicate that the time series evolve in-dependently of each other, or that the top 100 time series are not sufficient to cover the whole publishing activity.

Overall, we observed an irregularity of meme model X  X  parame-ters for different peaks of the same time series. In contrast ,our deconvolution model uses a single set of parameters for the en-tire time series, which are automatically estimated by perf orming a peak slope regression (using a single or multiple peaks). Figure 9 (c) demonstrates the output of a hyperbolic deconvolution m odel, which fits the time series consistently across all peaks. The output in this case is the time series, constructed by performing an inverse process of convolution over the deconvolution-estimated t ime se-ries of event importance.
First, we compare the observed error distributions between the meme and hyperbolic deconvolution models in Figure 10. A hy-perbolic deconvolution model was chosen as the closest matc hto amememodelregardingthepredictedshapesofpeakslopes(r e-fer to Equation 17). Moreover, our model used triangular e ( t ) shapes, automatically extracted using a deconvolution withparam-eters  X  = 0 . 8daysand  X  = 2 . 0, fixed for all time series. The de-convolution model reached an average RMSE of 0 . 11 with the stan-dard deviation of 0 . 09. The meme model demonstrated an average RMSE of 0 . 22 with standard deviation of 0 . 09. Taking into account the artifacts of data aggregation, noise and deviation of pe ak start-ing times, the error level of 0 . 2canstillbeconsideredasacceptable

We note that choosing smaller decay times results in smaller dif-ferences between event importance (deconvolved volume) an dvol-ume. On the other hand, this introduces more errors to the est i-mation of e ( t ) shapes (performed by piecewise linear regression) and therefore results in larger errors for the output approx imation. Choosing larger decay times, can also induce approximation errors due to the omission of smaller peaks from e ( t ) .Nevertheless,the output of our model is stable with respect to parameter varia tion (as demonstrated by our experiment in Figure 10, where fixed para m-eters still yield a good approximation quality). Thus, it is possible to perform deconvolution using the estimated parameters ac hieving nearly the same performance as when using the optimal parameters.
The performance of deconvolution models on meme dataset is depicted in Figure 11. We observe that the linear and hyperbo lic deconvolution models reached the best accuracies with aver age er-rors of 0 . 03 and 0 . 05 respectively, and standard deviations of 0 . 06 (thus, the difference in performance is not significant). Ho wever, while the linear model had an average parameter  X  of 0.5 (very small), the average parameters  X  and  X  of the hyperbolic model were 0.36 and 2.8 respectively. A more careful evaluation of the estimated parameters reveals that the hyperbolic model has almost the same parameter  X  of 0 . 36  X  0 . 03 across all topics in the dataset, but quite different  X  of 2 . 8  X  0 . 96. A similar pattern is observed for the triangular model, where a single decay parameter  X  has val-ues in the range 0 . 5  X  0 . 3. The exponential model demonstrated an average RMSE of 0 . 11 with standard deviation of 0 . 09, almost the same to our previous experiment with fixed parameters, but in this case the estimated parameter  X  was (on average) equal to 0 . 65, thus trying to approximate a usually much steeper hyperbolic res ponse. From these observations we conclude that meme data is more li kely to have a hyperbolic response pattern. But while the dominan ce of linear and hyperbolic response functions is clearly visibl e, their pa-rameters are significantly different from peak to peak. We analyzed 30 time series from Twitter using 1 d aggregations. The results of our evaluation, presented in Figure 12, demon strate agoodperformanceforthelinearmodel,thoughtheaveragep a-rameter  X  was 2 . 5withadeviationof0 . 9, indicating that a rather high fraction of peaks had small  X  .Sinceinourdatasetweusually have a small number of samples per peak (8-10), it is not possible to fully verify the hypothesis of the linear model. The obtaine dresults only prove that most events have a fast rise and drop of import ance around their peaks. The two other models (hyperbolic and exp o-
Figure 12: Deconvolution models accuracy for Twitter datas et. nential) have more powerful estimated decay parameters tha nthe linear model but also larger errors (  X  = 2 . 4  X  0 . 5,  X  and  X  e = 1 . 5  X  0 . 7). Finally, we observe that both models encoun-tered large variations of the error, probably indicating th eexistence of different kinds of response dynamics for topics or different re-sponse parameters for various events during the same time se ries.
In this section we evaluate correlation between sentiment s hifts and events, where events are extracted with the help of decon vo-lution, and sentiment shifts are determined using the measu res of positive and negative sentiment volumes s + ( t ) and s -ment contradiction level C ( t ) .

To evaluate the correlations, we picked 22 out of 30 selected topics in our Twitter dataset, which contained a sufficient n umber of events, and were suitable for computing bursts correlation. The results of our evaluation are summarized in Table 2, where fo reach time series and sentiment measure we present the values of Co sine similarity  X  C and time lag  X  of the best correlation. Additionally, we report the best-fit response dynamics "Type", and the aver age number of overlapping bursts "Num". We do not report Jackard coefficient  X  J ,sinceforhighly-overlappingsetsitshowsthesame behavior as  X  C .

We observe that negative sentiments demonstrate the highes tover-all correlation, followed by contradictions and positive sentiments. Taking a closer look at the data, we see that positive sentime nts are usually preceding the expected events (correlated with a negative lag), whereas negative sentiments are observed after or during these events (positive lag). For instance, such behavior is obser ved in our table for events surrounding the movie sequels  X  X angover X ,  X  X ce Age X  and  X  X arry Potter X , which had positive expectations be fore (during) the event, and negative sentiment afterwards. Ant icipated events like  X  X CROSS X ,  X  X uper Bowl X  or  X  X eica X  also have posi tive expectations, but in this time connected to events. Another group of anticipated events, like  X  X ERN LHC X ,  X  X eer Summit X ,  X  X qu ila Summit X  and  X  X ransformers X  features negative expectation sand positive outcomes. Interestingly, heavily promoted event slikenew camera announcement for  X  X eica X  on 09.09.2009, or availabi lity of  X  X oogle Wave X , have initially positive sentiments, but then re-ceive a mixture of controversial opinions during their peak ing inter-vals. In addition, some of unexpected events, like  X  X ran Ele ction X ,  X  X raq X ,  X  X bama X ,  X  X mail Blackout X  seen a bump of negative se nti-ments after their appearance, while Michael Jackson death fl ipped initially controversial (negative and positive) sentiments to positive.
Overall, we observe that the particular types of sentiment c hanges are connected to the particular behavior of events, and the same is true for their news dynamics. While different topics and media can be better described with different response functions, unusual events can still occur in the course of time, affecting senti ments in their own way. Therefore, it makes sense to organize the depe n-dency modeling component to operate at the level of events, rather than topics. This component still needs to monitor correlations for each topic, but this time filtering the events according to their type and particular characteristics, before trying to detect th erelevant sentiment shifts in their proximity. Table 2: Correlation between sentiment shifts and events in Twitter.
Our evaluation of news dynamics and their impact on sentimen ts is the first systematic work in this direction, which employs athor-ough and principled modeling of news distribution in variou smedia and studies news interaction with sentiments. We develop a n ovel model of news event dynamics, which allows to capture meanin g-ful and important characteristics of news events. Our model can ac-commodate various response functions, suitable for different cases, which should not necessarily be expressed as a differential equa-tion, but can be learned from the data. The results obtained b y applying our methods to different real datasets confirm thei rro-bustness and universality. Nevertheless, they also reveal that we need to address several more major challenges.

First, we observe that while different media have preferenc es for particular response dynamics, these are often determined b yevent types and topics. Thus, we need to extend our method of news volume deconvolution so that it will automatically determi ne the best model for every particular event and process the corresponding time interval individually. The choice of the suitable deco nvolution model can be based on the (learned) preferences of the given m edia and topic, but should also take model fitness into account. Ab ove all, this involves a refinement of the events importance mode land development of a robust and precise deconvolution optimiza tion strategy.

We also observe the existence of different parameters of res ponse dynamics for various events even during the same topic time s eries. Each of these events has a different importance, and also a di fferent impact on sentiments, suggesting that it is possible to predict sen-timent changes. In order to do that, we need to take into accou nt the type of response dynamics ( mrf )inadditiontotheevent X  X im-portance level, creating a more elaborate causality model. Still, predicting the types of these possible changes requires bui lding a database of event and sentiment shift profiles, and construc ting a classifier model based on these features. We aim at creating s uch a dataset as our next step towards the final solution.

Finally, we speculate that sentiment shifts may be caused by events on related topics, in addition to events on the same to pic. This leads to the necessity for a more advanced correlation a nd causality modeling, in order to predict sentiment shifts ac ross re-lated topics. [1] S. Asur, B. A. Huberman, G. Szab X , and C.
