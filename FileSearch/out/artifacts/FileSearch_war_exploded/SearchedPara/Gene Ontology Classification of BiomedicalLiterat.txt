 The rapid development of online resources of the biomedical community provides huge amount of valuable research data, such as the sequencing data and the biological literatures published. The dat a raises issues on managing this massive amount of information. How to fully utilize the information to have a more complete picture of the current understanding of the biomedical world becomes a pressing issue.
 viding three controlled vocabularies for describing molecular function, biological process, and cellular component of gene products. The Gene Ontology is used for collaborating databases of the gene products, which can be annotated to these three ontologies. Databases, such as MGI Genome databases 1 are mem-ber organizations of the GO Project. They provide annotation association with information, such as, gene sequence, protein structures, and also association of biomedical publications with the gene products and evidence statement on how the linkage is made. and analyze the literatures, discover encoded information conveyed with other resources, in order to provide the annotation. This has become a challenging task because of the evolving size of the gene products and amount of literatures available. As a result, there is the pressing need for techniques to facilitate the determination of appropriate function or annotation with gene products. pursued, such as Critical Assessment of Information Extraction Systems in Biol-ogy (BioCreAtIvE) and Text retrieval Conference (TREC) Genomics Track. One task of the BioCreAtIvE Workshop focuses on the automatic functional annota-tion of proteins using the Gene Ontology (GO) classes, which is to assign the GO term X  X  codes inside the gene ontology hierarchies. The low precision in perfor-mance illustrates that actual GO term annotation is considerably more difficult. Most participated groups [11,4] adopted text categorization methods, such as support vector machines and other supervised machine learning methods. task exploring the annotation of gene function according to Gene Ontology [6]. It involved the identification of documents having experimental evidence warrant-ing annotation with GO codes, and the identification of the GO hierarchies (Bi-ological process, Cellular component, Mol ecular function) that the article have the functions within, given the article and gene names. Most groups adopted a classification approach. Indiana University [12] achieved a top F-score 0.561, using variants of k-nearest neighbor model with weighted aggregated scores, MeSH terms, and gene names recognition. University of Wisconsin [13] achieved F-score 0.514 using a two-tier statistical machine learning system of  X  X one X -level and document-level predictions with Naive Bayes classifier and maximum entropy model respectively. Others used information retrieval approach [5] and statistical heuristic models [2,9].
 association of GO terms with function and protein annotation [8]. Raychaud-huri, et al. studied the use of different classification methods, maximum entropy, naive Bayes, and nearest neighbor classifications, with GO codes from biological process [10], and achieved 72% accuracy using maximum entropy.
 document classification approach, which encapsulates the idea of context orga-nization characteristics in articles. A feature engineering approach using con-text association pervaded in documents is employed. We exploit the proximity relationship of the features and the corresponding genes. The features having stronger proximity relationship with the corresponded genes will be regarded as having a higher significance. By assessing the underlying affinity of the features and the genes in the articles, a more effectiv e way for capturing the characteristic of the problem is established. Our approach outperforms the submission runs of TREC Genomics 2004 annotation hierarchy subtask. Among all the submissions, the F-score of the best run and mean F-score of all 36 submissions were 56.11% and 38.24% respectively, while our approach achieved an F-score of 60.24%. When an author writes, he or she would normally have an organization in mind to present their information [3] and context information, such as statistical infor-mation, is beneficial for text processing [7 ]. In particular, context organization is usually pervaded in biomedical literatures for expressing concepts and re-lations [14]. Both explicit and implicit organizations may exist. Explicit ones are section organizations of the texts, such as abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion. These section organizations have explicit indicators or boundaries inside the texts. Implicit organizations refer to structure(s) with-out explicitly specified boundaries. They are the hidden structures, which may or may not correspond to section boundaries. Therefore, they cannot be easily identified, and advanced methods are required to automatically discovering those hidden organizations. As an example, an author may express an idea or a concept within a certain context window and in which with some keynotes are closely adjoined together. We believe that by adopting feature engineering approach, this kind of organizations will have stimulating effect towards modeling. Gene Name Annotation. In function annotation, the key concept is the gene and all other features are associated to it in different extents. Hence, the first step is to identify the gene X  X  appearances inside the article, which we refer as the target gene. A tag, target name is used to substitute each matched target gene name. In addition to identifying the target gene for context association analysis, gene name annotation has the advantage of normalizing the mentions of a gene. This can reduce the burden of classification by refraining it from taking on redundant gene names, and focusing on capturing the concept of function annotation to the target gene.
 dictionary-based and rule-based approaches. For the dictionary-based approach, we construct synonym lists of genes from the MGI database of mouse, human, and rat, as synonyms from other species may also indicate the existence of the function relation. To capture the variations in the full name and abbreviation name of genes, we construct a set of rules to expand the synonym list to tackle the orthographical and morphological variations.
 Feature Extraction. The context association can provide clues for locating the correct gene and hierarchy association among all possible gene-hierarchy corre-lations. We employ the proximity relationship between the context words and the target gene for measuring the context association, since features appearing more distant to the target gene tend to be less closely related with it. computation of weight for feature extraction. Let f k i be the k-th feature, f k , at position i ,and g j is the target gene of document j . The association weight, pos ( f k i ,g j ), depends on the absolute distance between a term and the target gene of the document. The formula is shown in Equation 1. Equation 2 finds the absolute value of the closest distance between feature f k i and g j where position ( x ) represents the position of a feature in a document. win s ize is the number of terms appeared before and after the target gene. M and N represent the upper bound and the lower bound for the association weight, pos ( f k i ,g j ). The value of this association weight lies inside the range of ( M  X  N ). The implication of Equation 1 is that a feature being closer to the target gene indicates that it has a stronger association to the target gene, and therefore has a higher association weight. One constraint is that the features should be within a context window around the target gene; otherwise, no association weight will be added. document, d j , is calculated by Equation 3, where tf ( f k ) is the term frequency of feature f k in the document; sec ( f k i ) is the score of explicit organization of the document. This score can be a pre-assigned value for different position or section of the document, such as the introduction, method, etc. The section weight contributes to the importance on the association weight.
 df ( f k ) is the document frequency of feature, f k ,and D is the total number of document in the training dataset. Since both the feature weight and inverse document frequency can vary quite a large range of values depending the terms. The logarithm transformation is used for both the feature weight and the inverse document frequency for stabilizing the variance in them. Classifier Learning. After retrieving the context associations of the features and target gene, the representation tran sformation of each document-gene pair can be used for classifier learning and classification. To capture the similarity of context association across all the training articles, the supervised learning approach, k-nearest neighbor classifier is adopted. kNN is able to look for the highest similarity of context association a cross the training data. A 4-fold cross validation is used for tuning the parameters such as the number of features, the number of neighbors (k), and the threshold used for classifying a document, to obtain the best set of parameters for classification. The set of parameters that achieves the highest averaged performance over all the folds will be selected. The classifier will then be retrained using the whole training data set. The TREC Genomics 2004 annotation task dataset is used for the evaluation of our approach. The dataset contains 1,418 and 877 document-gene pairs for training and testing respectively which indicates the associated gene of each doc-ument assigned by MGI. An updated version of the data is also released with a total of 58 articles removed. However, the original dataset is used for compar-ative study of our approach with the TREC Genomics 2004 submission runs. Three kNN models correspond to the three GO hierarchies are developed using 4-fold cross validation. An overall evaluation of the 3 hierarchies is calculated using the evaluation program provided by TREC Genomics 2004.
 parameters namely, the window size, the upper bound, M and the lower bound, N, to evaluate their effects on the classification. An experiment using only bag of words as features and the classic TF-IDF feature weighting is carried out as the baseline for our evaluation. The results are shown in Table 1. With target gene annotated, there is an increase of 6.6% on F-score, which shows that the classifi-cation is largely benefited by the identification of target gene. It is also observed that as the value of M increases, the performance increases from 50.7% to 59.14% in F-score. This shows that our approach performs better as we put more empha-sis on features having stronger context association with the target gene. All our runs outperform significantly the median of the official runs in TREC Genomics 2004 subtask and the F-scores of our approach exceed the best official run. association of target genes and GO related terms. Hybrid approach can be em-ployed to pinpoint the characteristics of the GO hierarchies. For example, GO terms and definition feature list can be adopted to the CC hierarchy together with the context association weight. The F-score achieved using the hybrid ap-proach is 60.24%, which shows that the GO terms and the terms in their defin-ition are informative.
