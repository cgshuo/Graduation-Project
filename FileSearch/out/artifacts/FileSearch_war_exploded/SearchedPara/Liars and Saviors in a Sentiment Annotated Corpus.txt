 Most of the existing approaches to opinion mining propose algorithms that are independent of the text genre, the topic and the target involved. However, practice shows that the opinion mining challenges are substantially different depending on these fac-tors, whose interaction has not been exhaustively studied so far. 
This study focuses on identifying the most rele-vant challenges in mining opinions targeting media personalities, namely politicians, in comments posted by users to online news articles. We are interested in answering open research questions related to the expression of opinions about human entities in UGC. 
It has been suggested that the target identifica-tion is probably the easiest step in mining opinions on products using product reviews (Liu, 2010). But, is this also true for human targets namely for media personalities like politicians? How are these entities mentioned in UGC? What are the most productive forms of mention? Is it a standard name, a nickname, a pronoun, a definite descrip-tion? Additionally, it was demonstrated that irony may influence the correct detection of positive opinions about human entities (Carvalho et al., 2009); however, we do not know the prevalence of this phenomenon in UGC. Is it possible to establish any type of correlation between the use of irony and negative opinions? Finally, approaches to opi-nion mining have implicitly assumed that the prob-lem at stake is a balanced classification problem, based on the general assumption that positive and negative opinions are relatively well distributed in texts. But, should we expect to find a balanced number of negative and positive opinions in com-ments targeting human entities, or should we be prepared for dealing with very unbalanced data? 
To answer these questions, we analyzed a col-lection of comments posted by the readers of an online newspaper to a series of 10 news articles, each covering a televised face-to-face debate be-tween the Portuguese leaders of five political par-ties. Having in mind the previously outlined questions, we designed an original rich annotation scheme to label opinionated sentences targeting human entities in this corpus, named SentiCorpus-PT . Inspection of the corpus annotations supports the annotation scheme proposed and helps to iden-tify directions for future work in this research area. MPQA is an example of a manually annotated sentiment corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2005). It contains about 10,000 sentences collected from world press articles, whose private states were manually annotated. The annotation was per-formed at word and phrase level, and the sentiment expressions identified in the corpus were asso-ciated to the source of the private-state, the target involved and other sentiment properties, like inten-sity and type of attitude. MPQA is an important resource for sentiment analysis in English, but it does not reflect the semantics of specific text ge-nres or domains. 
Pang et al. (2002) propose a methodology for automatically constructing a domain-specific cor-pus, to be used in the automatic classification of movie reviews. The authors selected a collection of movie reviews where user ratings were explicitly expressed (e.g.  X 4 stars X ), and automatically con-verted them into positive, negative or neutral polar-ities. This approach simplifies the creation of a sentiment corpus, but it requires that each opinio-nated text is associated to a numeric rating, which does not exist for most of opinionated texts availa-ble on the web. In addition, the corpus annotation is performed at document-level, which is inade-quate when dealing with more complex types of text, such as news and comments to news, where a multiplicity of sentiments for a variety of topics and corresponding targets are potentially involved (Riloff and Wiebe., 2003; Sarmento et al., 2009). 
Alternative approaches to automatic and manual construction of sentiment corpora have been pro-posed. For example, Kim and Hovy (2007) col-lected web users X  messages posted on an election prediction website (www.electionprediction.org) to automatically build a gold standard corpus. The authors focus on capturing lexical patterns that users frequently apply when expressing their pre-dictive opinions about coming elections. Sarmento et al. (2009) design a set of manually crafted rules, supported by a large sentiment lexicon, to speed up the compilation and classification of opinionated sentences about political entities in comments to news. This method achieved relatively high preci-sion in collecting negative opinions; however, it was less successful in collecting positive opinions. For creating SentiCorpus-PT we compiled a collec-tion of comments posted by the readers of the Por-tuguese newspaper P X blico to a series of 10 news articles covering the TV debates on the 2009 elec-tion of the Portuguese Parliament. These took place between the 2 nd and the 12 th of September, 2009, and involved the candidates from the largest Portuguese parties. The whole collection is com-posed by 2,795 posts (approx. 8,000 sentences), which are linked to the respective news articles. This collection is interesting for several reasons. The opinion targets are mostly confined to a pre-dictable set of human entities, i.e. the political actors involved in each debate. Additionally, the format adopted in the debates indirectly encour-aged users to focus their comments on two specific candidates at a time, persuading them to confront their standings. This is particularly interesting for studying both direct and indirect comparisons be-tween two or more competing human targets (Ga-napathibhotla and Liu, 2008). 
Our annotation scheme stands on the following assumptions: (i) the sentence is the unit of analysis, whose interpretation may require the analysis of the entire comment; (ii) each sentence may convey different opinions; (iii) each opinion may have different targets; (iv) the targets, which can be omitted in text, correspond to human entities; (v) the entity mentions are classifiable into syntactic-semantic categories; (vi) the opinionated sentences may be characterized according to their polarity and intensity; (vii) each opinionated sentence may have a literal or ironic interpretation. Opinion Target: An opinionated sentence may concern different opinion targets. Typically, targets correspond to the politicians participating in the televised debates or, alternatively, to other relevant media personalities that should also be identified (e.g. The Minister of Finance is done! ). There are also cases wherein the opinion is targeting another commentator ( e.g. Mr. Francisco de Amarante, did you watch the same debate I did?!?!? ), and others where expressed opinions do not identify their target (e.g. The debate did not interest me at all! ). All such cases are classified accordingly. 
The annotation also differentiates how human entities are mentioned. We consider the following syntactic-semantic sub-categories: (i) proper name , including acronyms (e.g. Jos X  S X crates, MFL ), which can be preceded by a title or position name (e.g. Prime-minister Jos X  S X crates; Eng. S X crates ); (ii) position name (e.g. social-democratic leader ); (iii) organization (e.g. PS party, government ); (iv) nickname (e.g. Pin X crates ); (v) pronoun (e.g. him ); (vi) definite description , i.e. a noun phrase that can be interpreted at sentence or comment level, after co-reference resolution ( e.g. the guys at the Minis-try of Education ); (vii) omitted , when the reference to the entity is omitted in text, a situation that is frequent in null subject languages, like European Portuguese (e.g. [He] massacred... ). Opinion Polarity and Intensity: An opinion po-larity value, ranging from  X -2 X  (the strongest nega-tive value) to  X 2 X  (the strongest positive value), is assigned to each of the previously identified tar-gets. Neutral opinions are classified with  X 0 X , and the cases that are ambiguous or difficult to interp-ret are marked with  X ? X . 
Because of its subjectivity, the full range of the intensity scale ( X -2 X  vs.  X -1 X ;  X 1 X  vs.  X 2 X ) is re-served for the cases where two or more targets are, directly or indirectly, compared at sentence or comment levels (e.g. Both performed badly, but S X crates was clearly worse ). The remaining nega-tive and positive opinions should be classified as  X -1 X  and  X 1 X , respectively. 
Sentences not clearly conveying sentiment or opinion (usually sentences used for contextualizing or quoting something/someone) are classified as  X non-opinionated sentences X . Opinion Literality: Finally, opinions are characte-rized according to their literality. An opinion can be considered literal, or ironic whenever it conveys a meaning different from the one that derives from the literal interpretation of the text (e.g. This prime-minister is wonderful! Undoubtedly, all the Portuguese need is more taxes! ). The SentiCorpus-PT was partially annotated by an expert, following the guidelines previously de-scribed. Concretely, 3,537 sentences, from 736 comments (27% of the collection), were manually labeled with sentiment information. Such com-ments were randomly selected from the entire col-lection, taking into consideration that each debate should be proportionally represented in the senti-ment annotated corpus. 
To measure the reliability of the sentiment anno-tations, we conducted an inter-annotator agreement trial, with two annotators. This was performed based on the analysis of 207 sentences, randomly selected from the collection. The agreement study was confined to the target identification, polarity assignment and opinion literality, using Krippen-dorff's Alpha standard metric (Krippendorff, 2004). The highest observed agreement concerns the target identification (  X  =0.905), followed by the polarity assignment (  X  =0.874), and finally the iro-ny labeling (  X  =0.844). According to Krippen-dorff X  X  interpretation, all these values (&gt; 0.8) confirm the reliability of the annotations. 
The results presented in the following sections are based on statistics taken from the 3,537 anno-tated sentences. 4.1 Polarity distribution Negative opinions represent 60% of the analyzed sentences. In our collection, only 15% of the sen-tences have a positive interpretation, and 13% a neutral interpretation. The remaining 12% are non-opinionated sentences (10%) and sentences whose polarity is vague or ambiguous (2%). If one con-siders only the elementary polar values, it can be observed that the number of negative sentences is about three times higher than the number of posi-tive sentences (68% vs. 17%). 
The graphic in Fig. 1 shows the polarity distri-bution per political debate. With the exception of the debate between Jer X nimo de Sousa (C5) and Paulo Portas (C3) , in which the number of positive and negative sentences is relatively balanced, all the remaining debates generated comments with much more negative than positive sentences.

Also interesting is the information contained in the distributions of positive opinions. that there is a large correlation ( The Pearson corr lation coefficient is r = 0.917 ) between the of comments and the number of votes of each ca didate (Table 1). and negative sentences is relatively balanced, all the remaining debates generated comments with much more negative than positive sentences.

Anonymity might also be a big factor here. 
From an opinion mining point of view, we can conjecture that the number of positive opinions is a better predictor of the sentiment about a specific target than negative opinions. We believe that the validation of this hypothesis requires a thorough study, based on a larger amount of data spanning more electoral debates. 
Based on the data analyzed in this work, we es-timate that 11% of the opinions expressed in com-ments would be incorrectly recognized as positive opinions if irony was not taken into account. Irony seems to affect essentially sentences that would otherwise be considered positive. This reinforces the idea that the real challenge in performing opi-nion mining in certain realistic scenarios, such as in user comments, is correctly identifying the least frequent, yet more informative, positive opinions that may exist. 
Also, our study provides important clues about the mentioning of human targets in UCG. Most of the work on opinion mining has been focused on identifying explicit mentions to targets, ignoring that opinion targets are often expressed by other means, including pronouns and definite descrip-tions, metonymic expressions and nicknames. The correct identification of opinions about human targets is a challenging task, requiring up-to-date knowledge of the world and society, robustness to  X  X oise X  introduced by metaphorical mentions, neo-logisms, abbreviations and nicknames, and the capability of performing co-reference resolution. 
SentiCorpus-PT will be made available on our website (http://xldb.fc.ul.pt/), and we believe that it will be an important resource for the community interested in mining opinions targeting politicians from user-generated content, to predict future elec-tion outcomes. In addition, the information pro-vided in this resource will give new insights to the development of opinion mining techniques sensi-tive to the specific challenges of mining opinions on human entities in UGC.
