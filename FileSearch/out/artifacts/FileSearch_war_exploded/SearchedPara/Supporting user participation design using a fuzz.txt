 1. Introduction
In many Asian countries, standardized housing units with few opportunities for adaptation, which offer very few choices for a variety of customers with specific needs and preferences, are the typical circumstance ( Cheng and Lee, 2005 ). According to Juan et al. (2006) , it is common that a house buyer wants to remodel the housing unit even if it is just newly built ( Ozaki, 2003; Cheng and Lee, 2005 ). To solve this problem, searching for ways to reengineer the process and product to better conform to the demands of customers is necessary ( Juan et al., 2006 ). Up to date, several researches suggest that customizable products that fulfill customers X  current specific needs and preferences can be the best answer for the current direction in the housing market ( Ozaki, 2003; Barlow et al., 2003; Dikmen et al., 2005; Juan et al., 2006 ). Hippel (2005) also emphasized the crucial role of users in innovation in different industries and types of products ( Heiskanen and Lovio, 2010 ). It is generally acknowledged that user participation in the design process increases the likelihood of a successful outcome ( Carroll and Rosson, 2007 ). User participa-tion is a process through which design professionals can commu-nicate their design ideas to the client. It involves users in key design decisions, thus helping them anticipate and address needs in their building design ( Tweed and Woolley, 1992 ). For this reason, customer involvements or solutions associated with product conceptualization can be regarded as a pervasion on product innovation and are likely to result in more user satisfac-tion ( Yan et al., 2009; Terry and Standing, 2004 ). Granath (2002) has developed a participatory process in which user participation can result in an acceptable design solution and users can gain knowledge that will enable them to take an active part in the redesign of a building and in the design management.

However, there are still unresolved issues with a formal participation process.

Users are often poorly prepared for participation during the process of change and they may have problems conceptualiz-ing their wishes, articulating them to themselves and even more so, communicating them to others ( Granath, 2002; Cheng and Lee, 2005 ).
 Designing has become an increasingly complicated process.
One of the main problems for effective participation is the complexity of the design process and the difficulty for the lay person to understand jargon, methods, and processes that are familiar to design professionals ( Tweed and Woolley, 1992; users X  vague needs and preferences, providing proper knowledge and intuitive interfaces to users, by using notions derived from Lee and Lai (1996) on design rationale (DR). Accordingly, we propose to develop an example that could be applied to design rationale in a real design participation process. An intelligent interior design system was developed, a knowledge-based model with a 3D direct manipulation interface, based on a fuzzy AHP computation. DR is important for a number of reasons, princi-pally, because it includes both the reasons underlying design decisions as well as justifications. DR can assist in understanding design and, more particularly, in explaining why certain design alternatives are rejected. Concurrent with DR is the commonly accepted notion that, in any design process, the information space may be vast and users need to navigate it. Apart from navigation being essential, it is desirable that it should also be intuitive and interactive. To search and visualize the information space, knowl-edge tree are extremely effective. Direct manipulation can further help inexperienced designers; by interacting with design ele-ments intuitively and iteratively, it may help in easily under-standing design decisions.
 the thinking-aloud method was employed via a questionnaire to determine what a normal person X  X  design needs could be, as well as the kinds of design preferences available. Second, the relation-ship between design needs and a vocabulary of used designs was established. This was important in interpreting how to apply the fuzzy AHP algorithm. Third, domain expert knowledge was collected for specifying inference rules, and to build the knowl-edge base. Fourth, an interface was developed, which used both direct manipulation and a knowledge tree to guide users to integrate into DR and to operate the system efficiently. in a design process, and conclude with a description of the potential benefit of the paper. There are a number of factors to be considered in the actual client participation process; for house design these include elevation, material strength, even funding, etc. Such factors are beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, we concentrate on client participation, especially customization at the floor plan level in the conceptual design. More narrowly in this paper, we focus on kitchen layout. 2. Related work 2.1. Reasoning with design rationale maintaining, documenting, evaluating, annotating, and learning design. With DR, another designer can examine the original design intent as well as determine what alternatives have been considered and why they were rejected ( Burge and Brown, 2000 ).
DR can be seen as a form of  X  X  X orporate memory X  X , providing a valuable insight into a design that might otherwise be lost ( Pen  X  a-
Mora and Vadhavkar, 1997 ). Design rationale provides invaluable support for the design process by way of providing possible and pre-designed alternatives, reasons behind design decisions, justifications, trade-off evaluations, and argumentation. A DR system is a tool for capturing and creating information for dependency management, collaboration, reuse, maintenance, learning, and documentation ( Lee, 1997 ).

Early works highlighting the approaches of design rationale in software design have been found in Kunz and Rittel X  X  (1970) Issue-Based Information Systems (IBIS), McCall X  X  (1987) Procedural
Hierarchy of Issue-Based information System (PHIBIS), Maclean et al. X  X  (1996) Questions, Options, and Criteria (QOC), and Lee and
Lai X  X  (1996) Design Rationale Language (DRL). More recently, the ways of documenting and maintaining rationale for architectural decisions have resulted in some efforts to capture and use design rationale such as the IEEE standard 1471 X 2000 ( IEEE, 2000 )and the View and Beyond (V&amp;B) approach ( Clements et al., 2002 ). Bass et al. (2003) and Bosch (2004) have also focused on the need for documenting design rationale to maintain and evolve architec-tural artifacts, but they did not provide a new model for design rationale. Moreover, there is lack of proper supporting applications on how to document and reason with design rationale in making architectural design decisions ( Tang et al., 2006 ).

After investigation of design rationale models, we adopt two design rationale methods, which are DRL ( Lee and Lai, 1996 ) and
QOC ( Maclean et al., 1996 ). We employ DRL that supports argument space (body of reasons); issue space (decisions and their relationship); alternative space (multiple alternatives and their relationship); evaluation space (evaluation states that are made explicit and interrelated); and criteria space (criteria and their relations).

DRL provided the framework in which one could give context to three different meanings of DR ( Lee, 1997; Lee and Lai, 1996 ). These are shown in Fig. 1 .

For QOC, we make an adoption from Dutoit and Paech (2002) to provide a knowledge evaluation mechanism, which includes the following elements: questions (design issues); options (explored alternatives); and criteria (desirable qualities).

This decision is based on investigations into methods of implementing design rationale in software engineering. We specify a dynamic hierarchy structure, which is essentially a knowledge tree. The hierarchy is automatically created during the design process. The hierarchy gathers a number of alternative situations to form the alternative space. Each node in this space corresponds to nodes in the evaluation space, which is created using a standard decision tree and supported by knowledge. Every knowledge rule is fired or rejected by the criteria space. Knowl-edge acquisition is through interviewing experts. Later, the knowl-edge is confirmed by the evaluation mechanism. A detailed description of the dynamic tree is presented and demonstrated in Sections 2.3 and 5. 2.2. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP)
Conventional AHP, first introduced by T.L. Saaty in the 1970s, has been designed to help design makers to decide situations characterized by multiple criteria and a predetermined set of decision alternatives. Managerial judgments, articulated as pair-wise comparisons of the relative importance of one criterion over another in meeting a specific goal, are the main inputs to facilitate the AHP procedure ( Cakir and Canbolat, 2008 ).

Because the pairwise comparison procedure includes imma-nent uncertainty of the decision maker X  X  judgments, a logical way to define the comparison ratios as fuzzy numbers is concerned to overcome the limitation.

Fuzzy logic has been applied to numerous problems and applications owing to its ability to provide a framework through which non-deterministic problems could be addressed, since its introduction by Zadeh (1965) . In crisp set, the membership func-tion is either 0 or 1. However, crisp sets cannot explain numerous natural phenomena, whereas the membership function of a fuzzy set can provide a clearer explanation ( Lin and Peng, 1994 ). In other words, the fuzzy framework can be used for decision-making in the presence of uncertainty, because of its ability to express imprecise expert knowledge and rules. The soft-computing techniques for solving scientific problems have produced results that could not have been resolved with traditional methods ( Saridakis and Dentsoras, 2006 ). The fuzzy set theoretic approaches yielded a measure of support for the alternative decisions that provide the analyst with greater insight ( Laha, 2007 ). To represent linguistic assessment terms, in particular, fuzzy linguistic variables are used to express in natural or artificial language. In this paper, we employ fuzzy linguistic variables to assist the decision maker in describing his/her subjective judgment about the relative importance of one criterion versus another.

Van Laarhoven and Pedrycz (1983) , who studied with trian-gular membership functions and compared underlying fuzzy ratios, introduced a fuzzy version of the AHP. Many fuzzy AHP methods are proposed by various authors ( Deng, 1999; Leung and Cao, 2000; Lee et al., 2001; Kwong and Bai, 2002; Mikhailov, 2003; Tung, 2005; Benyoucef and Canbolat, 2007; Cakir and Canbolat, 2008 ). In this paper, the widely adopted triangular fuzzy number technique ( Tung, 2005 ) is used to represent a pairwise comparison of user requirements. Tung (2005) provides a fuzzy query algorithm module, which is divided into two parts: user fuzzy match ( Fig. 2 ) and fuzzy query for product. The user fuzzy match process has five steps:
Input required parameter . A selection question that is designed for the users to input what they care most about the product.
Fuzzy value of user type in database . Different users have different requirement features. Data are established in the database after collection and analysis.

User difference ratio . There is a formula for computing the difference ratio for the  X  X  X nput required parameter X  X  and  X  X  X uzzy value of user type X  X .

Suitability ratio . This calculates the suitability degree between the  X  X  X nput required parameter X  X  and  X  X  X uzzy value of user type X  X .
Most similar user type and weight . The most similar type is that with the highest suitability ratio, this type represents the user.
Then, the AHP was used for analyzing the weight of the feature.

For the fuzzy query for product process, the parameters are identical to those above for the user fuzzy match except the output, which, in our paper, is most the suitable product that is the product with the highest suitable ratio. The product best fits the user from among all products. 2.3. Direct manipulation with intuition
Navigation is a cognitive process in which landmarks are incorporated as general orientation points. Design navigation systems should be able to display designs at arbitrary levels of detail and should enable users to identify their own abstraction settings ( Chien and Flemming, 1996 ). In a generative design system knowledge-based module and knowledge tree can provide for a navigational scheme that allows designers easy access to desired information. It is desirable for users to interact easily and simply with a computer system, more importantly, to have control through direct manipulation. Schneiderman (1997) explains the following central tenets of user control: visibility of object and actions; rapid, reversible, incremental actions; and replacement of any complex command language like syntax with direct, visual manipulation of the object of interest.
With these three principles, it is possible to design a knowl-edge-based system in the residential intelligent CAD system with the following benefits ( Xiao and Hao, 1999 ): novices can learn basic functionality quickly, usually through a demonstration by a more experienced user; experts can work rapidly to carry out a wide range of tasks, even defining new functions and features; knowledgeable intermittent users can retain operational concepts; error messages are rarely needed; users can immediately see if their actions are furthering their goals, and if the actions are counterproductive, they can simply reverse the direction of their activity; users experience less anxiety because the system is compre-hensible and because actions can be reversed so easily; and users gain confidence and mastery because they are the initiators of action, they feel in control, and the system responses are predictable.

As the goal of this research is for novice users to design easily and intuitively, we consider a whole GUI using just mouse actions for all design works. There are three modules for the interfaces:
Knowledge-based module interface . The knowledge-based module serves to help the user find relevant knowledge. In this context, the user selects a region in the operation area and the module automatically displays information according to region type and the current situation. The module also lists the design items list inatreeview( Fig. 6 ). The tree represents a hierarchical view of information. A node can be expanded to reveal sub-nodes. The tree view helps users to navigate the information space. The user can select a node to find relevant information or also obtain positive or negative reasons for the item. The user can refer all the information in making a design choice by this way. 3. Users X  design behavior during user participation 3.1. Analysis of the design behavior of ordinary people
Understanding the processes followed by a person while design-ing can help with any of their design problems. Thirty ordinary people were randomly selected as samples. People, who had no interior design experience, who had a layout design problem and a desire to participate in the design process, were targeted. The thinking-aloud method was used to record the process. Design problems were formulated, like those below, in Fig. 7 .
When people design there is, typically, a problem step, a productive-mechanisms step, and a solution step ( Li, 2001 ). The problem step includes search, find, and define questions. The productive-mechanisms step seeks a feasible answer and prob-able options. The solution step tries to find a solution for the given problem. The results of the thinking-aloud method are summar-ized as follows. 40% of the sample population responded that they neither had clear considerations about design nor definite design targets.
Accordingly, they could not control design items clearly, and some space units were missed or, for instance, people forgot to design a restroom or living room. 53% declared that they needed to be supported with knowl-edge. That is, they had no confidence in the layout of their design; they were unsure whether it lacked functionality or quality. 70% had problems dealing with scale in the layout. Particularly they could not calculate the size of a space unit very well.
Some space units could not be placed. Other space units were either too big or too small.

In order to improve ordinary people X  X  design skills, a new solution process was provided, as shown in Fig. 8 . In the problem step, this process supplied design recommendations and an assistance function. It also provided suggestions to help make decisions. For the productive-mechanisms step, a new, adjustable process was specified, which took into consideration the intui-tional operation and provided knowledge or information. This process can guide people towards an improved design solution. 3.2. Process of fuzzy AHP design suggestion aid module
This paper supported a fuzzy AHP design suggestion aid module to guide people in their design. Our objective is to find a design template and recommendation that would suit a person X  X  preference. Fig. 9 shows the operation of the process.
The reason for using the fuzzy linguistic variable set men-tioned in Section 2.2 is that people often use adjectives to describe design requirements. For example, a person might say,  X  X  X  want the space a little wider X  X ;  X  X  X  like very bright light X  X . However, one cannot use traditional algorithms to understand how  X  X  X ide X  X  is  X  X  X  little X  X  or how  X  X  X right X  X  is  X  X  X ery. X  X  On the other hand, fuzzy linguistic reasoning is good at dealing with these kinds of uncertain and imprecise situations.

When a person invokes the design suggestion aid module, it queries for input data, relating queries about the person X  X  emo-tional feelings about interior design. In Table 1 , we provide a summary of the fuzzy linguistic variable set with the correspond-ing fuzzy values. 3.2.1. Cluster analysis for peoples X  preferences
According to the fuzzy values, the module needed to find the cluster most similar to the person X  X  preference type. Different people have different preferences. To provide design support for these different preferences, cluster an alysis was applied to analyze person type. People were asked about their preferences and there was a total of 126 valid responses received. As the scope of this research centers on the design of kitchens and dining rooms, four distinct variables were selected to distinguish person types from Lin (1998) :
Open kitchen . An open kitchen feels roomy and is ventilated. It also connects easily to another space unit.

Dining ambience and environment . There are strong relation-ships between person type and dining ambience. For example, for a family type of person, the kitchen has to have a genial environment; a  X  X  X ouble Income No Kids X  X  type of person prefers an elegant kitchen environment.

Cooking frequency . People who cook generally care about the function and requirements of a kitchen; those who do not, lean towards simple, comfortable, and cheerful environments.
Acceptable budget for decoration . The style of living can be subject to a person X  X  budget.
 After the cluster analysis, the results show five clusters.
Samples for each cluster had special properties, which influenced distinct variables in the cluster. The analysis is given from Tables 2 X 5 .

Open kitchen : Clusters 3 and 4 like open space, while Cluster 5 does not (see Table 2 ).

Dining ambience and environment : Cluster 1 does not care too much about the environment. In contrast, Cluster 3 is interested in a dining environment (see Table 3 ).

Cooking frequency : Cluster 1 likes to cook; Clusters 2 and 5 have no such desire (see Table 4 ).

Acceptable budget for decoration : Cluster 1 accepts a lower budget. On the other hand, Cluster 4 prefers higher quality and higher value decoration (see Table 5 ).

Then, each cluster was named according to the special property of that cluster, in line with the reference book ( Lin, 1998 ). The results are given below: 3.2.2. Weighting preferences by cluster each were analyzed to determine the ratios for each preference variable in the cluster. The AHP was used and included the ability to deal with several evaluative conditions under uncertain situations.
The process employs a questionnaire with seven levels, which respond to the degree of evaluation. The possible evaluation degrees were  X  X  X xtremely Important, X  X   X  X  X ore Important, X  X   X  X  X oderately Impor-tant, X  X   X  X  X qually Important, X  X   X  X  X od erately Unimportant, X  X   X  X  X nimpor-tant, X  X  and  X  X  X xtremely Unimportant. X  X  Each subject judges the relative importance of the variables. From Lin (1998) , seven requirement variables were selected.
These were  X  X  X pen space, X  X   X  X  X omfortable, X  X   X  X  X entilation, X  X   X  X  X mbient light, X  X   X  X  X mbience, X  X   X  X  X ooking Frequency, X  X  and  X  X  X quipment and function. X  X  Expert Choice, a software tool, was used to analyze the data and to establish a Pairwise Comparison Matrix for each cluster. For example, the matrix for Cluster 1 is shown in Table 7 .
Furthermore, the geometric mean for each row ( Fig. 10 ) was calculated and a weighted distribution of the requirement vari-ables was obtained by standardizing each cluster (that is, each row value divided by the column sum). The weights provide the preference degree of the requirement variables for each cluster ( Fig. 11 ).
 The weighted distribution of the requirement variables for
Cluster 1 is shown in Fig. 12 . Analysis of the other clusters is similar. The weighted distributions of the requirement variables for the other cluster are given in Table 8 . 3.2.3. Converting to the fuzzy values and distinguishing peoples X  clusters
The weighted raw cluster data in Table 8 were converted to fuzzy values. The values are given in Table 9 .

The result in Table 9 was compared to the person X  X  fuzzy value, which is asked from the answers to the questions and converted as listed in Table 1 . An example of the fuzzy values for the people X  X  responses is shown in Table 10 .
 There is a difference ratio ( P i ) between clusters and people. Each person X  X  requirement variable minus the relative variable for each cluster leaves a difference. After squaring and taking the square root, the module calculates the difference ratio between people and clusters: P  X 
Table 11 shows that the smallest difference is with people of a specialized-kitchen type. In this case, the cluster represents a person of a specialized-kitchen type. 3.2.4. Fuzzy value conversion of interior design templates
In order to suggest a suitable interior design, ten templates were selected from Lin (1998) . Each design template was ana-lyzed according to the requirement variables defined in Section 3.2.2. The S -function converted a feature value of the design template to a fuzzy value. The S -function has a membership function, where, as the value of the variable gets larger, the more satisfied the person becomes. The S -function was applied to all the requirement variables. The shape of the S -function is shown in
Fig. 13 (Lin and Peng, 1994). a is the minimum value among all the templates in the same variable; b is the (minimum value+maximum value)/2 among all templates in same variable; g is the maximum value among all templates in same variable.
 The formula is given below:
S  X  x ; a , b , g  X  X 
These parameters are listed in Table 12 . For instance, if the equipment and function of design template four is 5, and we apply the S -function to it, we get a value between 3  X  a  X  r 5  X  x  X  o 5 : 5  X  b  X  . Its formula is 2  X  5 3 = 8 3  X  for the equipment and function of design template four is 0.32.
Other feature values of a design template are inferred in the same way. The fuzzy values for the design templates are given in
Table 13 . 3.2.5. Interrelationship between preferences and design templates
The preceding section described how to find the cluster corresponding to a person type and converted it to a fuzzy value, respectively. In this section, the most suitable design template to match a person is described. People clusters and weights for each cluster are given in Table 14 .

Formula (4.3) was used to calculate the difference ratio between a feature value of the design template and a person X  X  preferences. Weights are considered for each different cluster. This method was used to find a suitable design template for people: e  X 
The difference ratios between the design templates and a person are shown in Table 15 .

A suitability ratio was employed to calculate whether a design template fits a person. Suitability ratio is deduced from the difference ratio. For this, the Z -function is used. Its characteristic is that as the values get smaller, the more satisfied the person becomes. Formula (4.4) calculates the suitability ratio. The result is shown in Table 16 .
 Suitability ratio (ci)  X  Z -function (ei)
Z  X  x ; a , b , g  X  X  a  X  0, b  X  ( a + g )/2  X  0.3631, g  X  max (ei)  X  0.7262
From the values of the top three strongest suitability ratios, the suggestion-aid module will provide the top three design templates for each person. The person will thus have more options to choose. 4. Knowledge-based module scheme The knowledge-based module has three steps:
Knowledge acquisition , where knowledge should be validated, structured, and relevant. Validation specifies which kind of question can be solved. Structuring confirms how the knowl-edge is arranged and stored. Relevance refers to relationships between the different knowledge groups.

Knowledge inference and representation , here, knowledge should be expressed in a specific form. It should be inferable and applied in a logical manner.

Integrated knowledge base to DR module should pass evaluation, verification, and test using QOC and DRL. It should be con-firmed that there is enough knowledge to achieve the system goal. If not, the developer would need to acquire more knowl-edge to fix the module. 4.1. Knowledge acquisition
In the initial stage, the reading content was used to acquire knowledge. Relevant sources ( Tsui, 1992 ) were scanned and data were arranged. Knowledge included three parts: spatial relation-ship, equipment plan, and issues of relationship in the area. A part of knowledge for a kitchen was structured, as shown in Fig. 14 . 4.2. Knowledge inference
The knowledge acquired is structured to suit the design process. The knowledge-based module lists the basic design items that are to be designed. Moreover, knowledge is integrated into each design item and supports the item whenever the item is designed. This approach uses rule-based knowledge inference. That is, if X  X hen rules are used for deduction. When a person selects a specific area to design, the inference engine deduces relevant knowledge according to the scope of the selected area (see Fig. 15 ). When a person selects, say,  X  X  X itchen X  X , the knowl-edge-based module judges whether the kitchen is adjacent to one of the (other) allocated rooms. If the answer is  X  X  X es X  X , the module goes to the next step; if not, the module infers relevant knowl-edge about the allocation. The module then recommends much more suitable designs. The user can then decide what they want and how they want to allocate the layout. 4.3. Integrated knowledge base to DR module
This system provides a mechanism for the knowledge base integrated to our DR module. This helps users to understand considerations behind decisions, and why the relevant knowledge suits the user. The method is referred to as Questions, Options, and Criteria (QOC). It begins with questions to find probable solutions. It considers options towards positive and negative directions. After determining the more suitable solutions, it recommends options to the user.

The QOC method was applied in this study. First an assump-tion was formed that decisions had been made to create a kitchen layout and change the equipment in it. From this starting point, several questions were posed to discover more details about the decision. In this example, a change of equipment was examined as part of the customization, noting that the placement of equip-ment relates to a problem of function and use. The study aimed to discover what kind of decision was better. The question was posed:  X  X  X hat kind of worktop suits this kitchen? X  X  It involved an interesting design decision, and was different from the option of placing the same equipment in another room.
 shape, L shape, U shape, and Island shape. Fig. 16 shows the QOC notation for the design space. The notation uses nodes and links to show the relationship between Questions, Options, and Criteria. The role of the Question is to delineate local contexts within the design space. The alternative options represented to consider how the design could have been different. T he process of choosing an option needs a range of reasons to support the considerations. Criteria represent the required properties of the artifact. It is important to articulate the Criteria clearly, b ecause it relates to how the options are evaluated. Fig. 16 shows options with relevant criteria; these criteria are important factors affecting decisions like  X  X  X fficient work area X  X  or  X  X  X ost used area. X  X  If an alt ernative option is supported, there should be positive links between the option and the criteria. If an alternative option negates those Criteria, there should be negative links between the option and the c riteria. The net positive and negative criteria for an option can thus be calculated, allowing an evaluation of the relative quality of each option. However, user preference still needs to be calculated as this is an important element in decision-making. People often care about different criteria. QOC provides the rough approach to represent the choices people make.
The QOC structure is mapping with the DRL mechanism to get design issues. The options are overlapping with the alternatives in
DRL terms. In any design process, designers have a series of tasks, each of which leads to issues to be c onsidered. Issue space is the term used to represent all issues that are raised during the design process, providing a global and hierarchical view of how individual issues are related. Decisions often influence one another. For exam-ple, a decision can be a sub-decision of a parent decision. In customizing a house, the two main issues for the designer are the changes to layout and to equipment, that is,  X  X  X ow can I arrange the layout? X  X  and  X  X  X ow can I change the equipment? X  X  Each issue has alternative responses, and users have to compare and choose from among them. Alternative space is a term used to describe all the alternatives. This space makes explicit certain alternatives, including relationships, structure, and supporting reasons. Every alternative should have one or more arguments to describe the reasons for its current evaluation and to answer queries such as,  X  X  X hat are the Alternative designs, and what are their pros and cons? X  X 
In this case, in arranging a layout, one can  X  X  X tart X  X  from  X  X  K (kitchen) X  X  or  X  X  L (living room) X  X  as the alternatives. Starting from  X  X  K  X  X , there is a significant pro, which is the  X  X  X reedom to setup a room as a kitchen X  X  and a con,  X  X  X he size of another room imposes limitations. X  X  If the user chooses to start from  X  X  K  X  X , the pros and cons influence subsequent decisions on the design of the other rooms. The next decision will be to arrange  X  X  K 4 D (dining room) X  X  or  X  X  K 4 L  X  X , and a similar process continues.

Once explicit alternatives are identified, there is a need to articulate the evaluation status of these alternatives. Evaluation status could be an ordinal, such as  X  X  X ery good, X  X   X  X  X ood, X  X   X  X  X ormal, X  X   X  X  X oor, X  X  and  X  X  X ery poor. X  X  Evaluation space is the term used to describe the evaluation status. The evaluation space is made explicit, as follows: the user evaluates an alternative, and the system merges the individual evaluations into an overall evalua-tion ( Fig. 17 ). It is also important to consider criteria when the system makes an overall evaluation. Criteria are used for evalua-tion and it is important to explicitly represent their relationships. Criteria can support or deny arguments for evaluation; that is, evaluations are not only made by the user but are also based on criteria. Criteria have relationships such as specialization, gener-alization, or mutual exclusiveness. In this example,  X  X  K  X  X  is the starting point and is an alternative, and its evaluation is  X  X  X ood X  X ; its criteria are:  X  X  X etting for enough space X  X  and  X  X  X omfortable for housework X  X , which support the evaluation. 5. Prototype implementation 5.1. System architecture
An interior design system was implemented to help people without interior design background or education. The system architecture is made up of two steps: first, the user-operation step and second, the knowledge-inference step. Fig. 18 shows the system architecture diagram.

In the user-operation step, the user can answer the questions from the system. People can also get relevant information from the design item area, which shows basic design steps. The system goes into a knowledge-inference step once the user has responded to relevant questions from the system. The system suggests design templates from the database that best fits the user. The user can design using a 2D X 3D graphical user interface. Designs are produced using a mouse. Designs can be used or modified from a selection of the design templates. Also, the system automatically gives relevant knowledge according to the design situation. Users can get more knowledge from the knowledge area in the interface. 5.2. Operational scenario tion in, interior design. He wants to buy a house in Taipei, but would like to design it to suit his needs. He is given the system developed in this study for this task.

Fig. 19 shows a screen capture. Tommy has no design experi-ence, and he has no initial ideas for the layout of his house. The design item list, located at the bottom right of the interface, provides a series of basic design steps. The knowledge area, at the top right of the interface, shows the kinds of things Tommy would need to decide.

First, Tommy can choose the 2D operational environment from 2 ratio buttons ( Fig. 20 ) to create the layout for the house ( Fig. 21 ). He can choose components in the furniture area at the bottom of the interface. Tommy picks a wall and selects the 2D operation area. After arranging all the components, he can easily finish a layout ( Fig. 22 ).

After finishing the layout setting, Tommy can switch to the 3D interface. The system shows the layout in 3D. The bottom left of the interface has the furniture list. If a node of the furniture tree is selected, the right side area shows a picture of the furniture and its name. Tommy can click and place the furniture in the 3D operation area ( Fig. 23 ).

Tommy does not like what he has designed. He tries to find a template to use by using the Wizard. The system pops up a dialog box to ask what kind of area he wants to design. Tommy selects the kitchen wizard. The wizard asks relevant questions. Tommy can choose the degree of his preferences. From these responses, the system infers Tommy X  X  cluster type, displaying suitable templates using fuzzy value inference. With the displayed cluster and template information, Tommy selects the design template he likes ( Fig. 24 ). The system places the template in the operation area. Tommy can continue to design from the template ( Fig. 25 ).
Tommy wants to observe whether the selected template is satisfied or not. Unfortunately, the given template still needs to be customized. When the current items require to be modified, he feels he needs more reference points or knowledge to consider. The system automatically shows relevant knowledge, in the knowledge area, whenever a user selects the relevant region in the operation area ( Fig. 26 ). The module also lists the design items list in a tree view. From the supporting knowledge and reasoning,
Tommy can finally combine all the information in making a design choice.
 5.3. User test and system evaluation of our GUI
After having finished our implementation, we let users operate the system. The same people who were asked about their preferences and made a house design by hand at that time were asked to make a house design again using our system at this time.
Since the user test is one-to-one in-depth interview, there were a total of 30 valid responses received.
 Results for the evaluation of the GUI are shown in Table 17 . Over 70% of the users had a positive feeling for our GUI. Especially, they felt this interface is quite efficient for the design.
On the other hand, they felt that the interface is still not very easy to use, comparatively. In future work, we need to find problems and solutions in detail to get more empirical data from different kinds of GUI modules. 6. Discussions and conclusion
This paper is the first attempt for housing customization domain to integrate the knowledge base to DR model and to implement the problems and solutions for user participation in the decision-making process of interior design in practice. The issues raised in this paper are as follows:
Integrated fuzzy AHP implementa tionofadesignsuggestionaid module to a knowledge-based module . We apply the fuzzy linguistic variable set to capture users X  requirements represented by vague adjectives and to recommend interior design templates according to their preferences. Thi s is an assumption that people often use uncertain adjectives to describe their design require-ments. The questionnaire and thinking-aloud observations yielded supportive results, suc h as  X  X  X eople lack knowledge of how to design X  X  and  X  X  X eople X  X  short concentration period. X  X  Our user test shows that it is solvable by our fuzzy AHP implementa-tion and integrated it to knowledge-based module.

Merging two design rationale models, QOC and DRL . In this paper, we combine two design rationale models, QOC and DRL, to get the complement of one model and the other. We also refer to Dutoit and Paech (2002) to adopt their advanced concepts. However, ideally, a standardized DR model to apply in the real practice is necessary. The IEEE 1471 X 2000 standard is still under testing for architectural description to compare the entity and relationship representations of specific tools ( Tang et al., 2010 ).

Knowledge module to help with design customization . There were a number of salient factors to be considered in interior design. Ordinary people do not have the ability to think like experts. Moreover, non-expert design may lack practicality.
For this reason, this paper suggests that expert domain knowl-edge of interior design is integrated into the system. The knowledge module supports for an explanation and reasoning behind design decisions that respond to the users X  current situations and provides the chance to customize from the template suggested by the system.

From mass customization to mass personalization . After two decades of its commencement, mass customization is now showing undoubted signs of moving into the mass personali-zation area ( Kumar, 2007 ). Tseng et al. (2010) defines perso-nalization as  X  X  X o achieve satisfying each customer as an individual. X  X  According to our operational scenario, user can get the benefit out of mass customization, represented by the
Wizard. The user, however, still has a chance to make it personalized by designing from the chosen template.

In addition to the four points, an intuitive interface for novices is used to provide a GUI 2D/3D interfac e for an interior design system. Even though it is shown to our user test that the GUI and intuitive-operation methods help the users to design easily without special education or training, it is still another substantial issue related to the HCI domain, which can be further improved in many respects. In a future version, the system would implement the same conceptual ideas but change the GUI to get more intuitive user interactions.
In this paper, we focus on client participation in effective design, especially in personalization at the floor level of kitchen conceptual layout design. Even though, this paper has much more focused on mass customization, it can be expandable to fall into the mass personalization zone. We also claim that this system can be applied to all interior design space in a similar fashion. References
