 A social matching system can be seen as a recommender system that recommends people to other people instead of recommending products to people. Recommending people is more complicated and sensitive compared with recommending products (Tobias, 2007). The reason behind this is the special nature of the relationship be-tween the users in social matching systems like online dating networks. Analysis of an underlying online dating network shows that it is not always true when two users share the same attributes (such as values that describe themselves including age, personality, and smoking habit), then they can be recommended to each other. As a result, the standard recommendation techniques may not be appropriate to match people in online dating networks. Another issue is the increasing numbers of social network members along with their information, which builds up the computational complexity. In Facebook, for example, there are more than 500 million active users, with 50% of the active users logging on in any given day (www.facebook.com, 2010). Another example is RSVP which consider ed as the largest dating network in Australia, with more than 2 million members and an average of 1,000 new members every day (http://www.rsvp.com.au/, 2010). 
In such social networks, a lot of personal information about users is required. This information can be divided into explicit and implicit information. The explicit informa-tion is collected by asking the user to answer a series of questions which represent his/her characteristics and preferences. Many social networks also record user X  X  behav-iour on the network (such as sending messages, watching profiles). A user X  X  online activities are referred to as his/her implicit information. Three learning approaches are widely used in social matching systems: ru les-based approach, content-based approach and collaborative approach (Brusilovsky, Kobsa, &amp; Nejdl, 2007). 
Even though social matching systems are increasingly used and attract more atten-tion from both academic and industrial researchers, many aspects still need to be explored and developed. A major issue is the accuracy of matching users in social net-works. A two-way matching process is needed to deal with the compatibility between users whom have been recommended. The majority of existing social matching systems consider the similarity between user x and user y and produce the recommen-dation without checking that user y is also compatible with user x . Terveen and McDo-nald (2005) have also raised some general questions, namely: what is the information that should be used to achieve high quality matching? How does the system make a good match? Is it possible to evaluate the matching process and then use the evaluation outcome as a feedback? The authors argue that data mining techniques can be used to improve recommendation in social networks (Terveen &amp; McDonald, 2005). 
Clustering is one of the data mining techniques that can be used to improve the matching process in social networks (Eirinaki &amp; Vazirgiannis, 2003). It reduces the data size and cuts down the complexity that the matching process has. Moreover, a clustering technique assists the recommendation process in social networks by over-coming some existing problems such as cold start and sparsity. For example, cold start problem occurs when a new user joins a social networks and the system has not gather enough information about the user to be matched. Assigning this user to an existing cluster which already has been matched with the appropriate opposite gender cluster allows him\her to receive recommendation instantly. For these reasons, clustering is used in this paper to group together users who have similar characteristics. 
This paper proposes a social matching system that considers both explicit data (in-formation that users provide about themselves) and implicit data (user activities on the social networks) to improve the matching process in social networks. It utilizes the dating type of social matching system in which opposite gender users are recom-mended to each other. Explicit data are used to cluster male and female users into homogonous groups. Then the male clusters are matched with the female clusters us-ing implicit data and users are recommended to each other. The proposed system is evaluated on a dataset obtained from an online dating website. Empirical analysis demonstrated that the proposed system improves the accuracy of the recommenda-tions from 13.9% to 50.32%, reduces the matching complexity by 93.95% and over-comes cold-start problem. The matching process in a majority of social networks is based on explicit data that users provide to describe themselves (Boyd &amp; Ellison, 2008). However, the proposed system proved that using implicit data that represents the users X  activities in the matching process increases the recommendation accuracy by 36.42%. A. Preliminaries There are many types of social networks according to their purpose of use. An online dating system is a type of social network that aims to introduce people to their poten-tial partners. Online dating systems usually keep two different types of data about their users; implicit data and explicit data. The implicit data are collected by recording the users X  activities while they are interacting with the system. These data include usually obtained through an online questionnaire; the users are asked to answer a number of questions which represent their personality traits and interests. The explicit data can be divided into two subsets, data about the user and data about the preferred partner. where o i is an attribute that specifically describes the user (such as age, height, educa-allowed to have one value for each o i attribute; however, they may have a null, single or multiple values for each p i attribute. 
A user u i also performs some activities on the network such as viewing another may be interested in contacting u 2 . Other activities usually include communicating with short pre-defined messages ( kiss ) 1 and long free-text messages ( email ) 2 . Sending a kiss k t that contains a pre-defined message to u 2 . Users can select one of a variety of k that represents the users X  feelings. u 2 can reply to the kiss sent by u 1 by using one of several pre-defined messages k r which vary between a positive and a negative reply. k r may be null indicating the target user has not responded to the sender X  X  request. Furthermore, u 1 is allowed to send emails E ( u 1 , u 2 ) to another user u 2 . 
In this paper, both the user profiles and user activities are employed to improve the recommendations in the proposed system. User profiles are used to cluster similar users in groups according to their profiles X  similarities. Clustering users into groups overcomes two major problems in the matching process, which are cold start problem and the data sparsity, and results in increasing the matching accuracy and efficiency, as the findings show. Once users are clustered, data obtained from the users X  activities (implicit data) are used to match the users X  clusters with each other. The clustering and matching phases are discussed in the following in more detail. B. Clustering users in social networks In order to cluster users in social networks the data need to be pre-processed. The pre-processing includes data integration and tr ansformation. Once the data have been integrated and transformed, they are then divided into two groups: male users denoted the data to be clustered in the next phase. The male and female users are clustered separately in order to match the male clusters with the female clusters using the clus-ters centroid, and then recommend users to each other. The male users are clustered based on their preferred partners X  attributes { p 1 , p 2 ,... p g }. This is done to ensure high accuracy matching. Using both their own and preferred attributes in clustering the For example, while two users are similar in their own attributes, they may be very different in what they are l ooking for in their partners. C. Matching clusters and recommendation After clustering male and female users, two processes are performed: matching clusters and recommending clusters X  members to each other. Let C m be the clustering solution a be the centroid vector of cluster C f1 represented as { a f11 , a f12 ,... a f1g }. 
This process of matching all clusters is based on the communications between clus-ters X  members utilizing the implicit data. As mentioned previously, social networks contain some implicit data that can be used to improve the recommendation. Users between a male user X  X  cluster and the rest of female users X  clusters are assessed to de-termine the pair of clusters that has more interactions between them; these are then recommended to each other. A kiss is defined as a successful kiss when it received a positive reply k r which means that the opposite party is also interested in this relation-ship. The communication score  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  can be presented as follows. When the matching process is completed, the recommendation phase takes place. In this phase, recommendations are presented to the users in ranking order of users X  compatibility scores. The compatibility scores are calculated between the members of the pair of matched (or compatible) cluste rs according to members X  profile and prefe-rence similarity. The user profile vector of the male user u m C mc is compared with the preference vector of all female users u f C fd . The compatibility score  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  can be presented as follows. Figure 1 explains the proposed matching algorithm The proposed system has been tested on a dataset obtained from a real online dating website that contains more than two million users. A subset of data were used show-ing all the active users in a period of three months, as the data analysis shows that an average user is active for three months and at least initiates one communication chan-nel. Therefore, the proposed system targets the users who are active within three months. A. Evaluation Measures Success rate and recall are used to evalua te the accuracy of the proposed social matching recommendation system. They evaluate the accuracy of recommending us-ers in recommendation systems. The success rate was used to measure the probability of recommendation being successful as indicated by the (positive) kiss returned by the recommended partner. Recall was also used to measure the probability of recom-mending the right partners. Both are mathematically presented below. B. Experiment Design Experiments were conducted on a machine with 3GB of RAM and a 3.00GHz Intel Cor2Due processor. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the accuracy of recom-mendation in social network using the proposed method. The results are compared by the baseline results when the proposed method is not used. The baseline success rate that users achieve in their communications without using the proposed system is 13.9%. The proposed method uses the implicit information to match the clusters. The proposed method is also compared with a variation when the clusters are matched with the explicit information only. The profile and preference similarity are used to compare the clusters X  centroids for both male and female clustering solutions and matching was done based on their explicit profile information rather than implicit information. In this case, the matching score  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  is used as follows. C. Results and Discussion The first phase of the experiment was clustering male and female users individually into 100 clusters. We selected 100 clusters as this is the most appropriate value where the majority of clusters are homogeneous and have a similar average number of mem-bers per group. However, we had several clusters that contain higher number of users which indicates that there are some popular attributes that many users share. Oracle Data Miner (ODM) was used to cluster both male and female users. K-means clustering algorithm was used to cluster both datasets by using the Euclidean distance function. K-means was chosen because of its simplicity and speed which allows it summarized in Table 1. 
The second phase of the experiment was matching male clusters with the female clusters and then recommending users to each other. In this phase, clusters were matched using successful communication. In this stage, we calculated the success rate when we matched the clusters based on the communication as well as when we matched them based on their similarity. The success rate increased from 0.31 when clusters were matched based on similarity to 0.78 when clusters were matched based on communication. This demonstrate that matching clusters based on the com-munications is more efficient as the success rate is more than double when compared to matching clusters based on their similarity. The main reason for the low success rate (when considering the similarity) is the sparsity that social network data have. As a result, the proposed system utilizes the communications to match clusters with each other.

Once the male clusters are matched with the female clusters, the recommendation task takes place. The top n female recommendation will be presented to each member of the male clusters. The ranking is based on the similarity between male and female users, as explained in Section 2. As shown in Table 2, the proposed system achieves a high success rate compared to the baseline system, especially with the top 1 to top 10 recommendations. In terms of recall, our sy stem gained the best recall when recom-mending all users with a percentage of 7.18%. The recall then decreases to reach 2.45% with the top 1 recommendation. 
With the improvement in success rate, the proposed system also reduces the com-putational complexity of matching users in social networks. The baseline system has to compare every male user with all the female users. However, the proposed system limits the comparisons to be with an assigned cluster. For the dataset used in this ex-periment, instead of conducting 1443519630 comparing processes, we were able to reduce the number to be 92466720 which reduces the proposed system computational complexity by 93.95%. Many social matching systems are based on recommender system techniques. The dif-ference is that the social matching systems recommend people to each other rather than recommend items to people. Recommending people to each other is much more com-plicated and challenging. Therefore, current social matching systems suffer from two issues, the computational complexity and the matching accuracy. 
In this paper, a new hybrid social matching system was presented that uses implicit and explicit data to improve the recommendation process. The clustering technique was also used to reduce the computational complexity in the proposed system. Experimental results showed that the proposed system provides satisfactory and high-quality recommendations with reasonable computational complexity. 
Matching users in social networks based on their implicit data is a promising re-search area with many aspects that need to be explored. Furthermore, data mining techniques including clustering and associatio n rules can be employed to develop ways to match users in social networks.
