 1. Introduction
The term active of active magnetic bearing implies that bearing forces are actively controlled by means of electromagnets, a well-designed closed control loop and other components such as position sensors and power amplifiers ( Schweitzer and Maslen, 2009 ). Therefore, the rotor of the AMB can be suspended to the predefined positions by the controlled electromagnetic forces without mechanical contact and friction between the magnetic bearing and the rotor ( Schweitzer and Maslen, 2009 ; Chiba et al., 2005 ). Based on the noncontact and frictionless characteristics, the magnetic suspension of AMB offers many practical and promising advantages over conventional bearings such as longer life, lower rotating frictional losses, higher rotational speed, and elimination of the lubrication ( Peijnenburg et al., 2006 ; Knospe, 2007 ; Hijikata et al., 2009 ). Hence, AMBs have been successfully and widely implemented in various high performance applica-tions including the rotating devices such as turbine engines ( Knoth and Barber, 1998 ), flywheel energy and storage devices ( Pichot et al., 2001 ), bearingless motor ( Miyamoto et al., 2009 ), vacuum pump ( Noh et al., 2005 ), and conveyor ( Ohji et al., 2004 ), and non-rotating devices such as motion control stage ( Kim et al., lower values and the control current is superimposed on only one side of the pair of coils. Though the energy consumption can be improved efficiently, this operating mode is only suitable for low bearing stiffness and low vibration applications due to poor slew rate and controllability of the force. If there is no bias current used and only the control currents are supplied to the coils, it is categorized as Class-C drive mode. Though the rotor heating is the least, high nonlinearity of the electromagnetic force dynamic degrades the control characteristic greatly.

Designing an active control scheme for an AMB is still a challenging topic particularly in a multi-axes AMB system due to its highly nonlinear and open-loop unstable control character-istics. Therefore, a sophisticated controller which is capable of regulating and stabilizing the rotor within the narrow air gap is imperative to deal with the different operating demands and environments. In Bi et al. (2005 ), an automatic learning control scheme based on time-domain iterative learning control and gain-scheduled control was proposed to eliminate unbalance effects which adversely affect the operation of four RAMBs. Moreover, the variable learning cycles and learning gains were employed in the learning process to achieve better control performance against rotating speed fluctuations. An adaptive backstepping controller was designed in Sivrioglu (2007 )to compute control currents of a vertical-type AMB accepting unknown system parameters and no bias currents. The limits of control effectiveness for the AMB was tested subjected to the external acceleration disturbances. Furthermore, three controllers including linear state feedback controller (LC), feedback lineariza-tion with a LC (FLLC), and feedback linearization with an integral sliding mode controller (ISMC) were designed and implemented for a three-pole AMB without a motor in Chen et al. (2005 ). It was found that the ISMC yields the best transient-and steady-state performances compared with the LC and FLLC. On the other hand, ISMC was also implemented for the system with a motor. The results indicated that the three-pole AMB is indeed feasible. In addition, a linear parameter-varying (LPV) control method was evaluated experimentally on an AMB system in Lu et al. (2008 ). In this design, the system uncertainties were identified using radial basis function network, and an uncertainty weighting function was approximated for LPV control synthesis. Experimentations verified the robustness of the LPV controllers for a wide range of rotating speed.

The development of proportional X  X ntegral X  X erivative (PID) control has been around for 90 years and is still popular for industries and academies nowadays ( Crowe, 2005 ). Though com-plicated control algorithms such as adaptive control or optimize control have been researched and proposed in recent years, PID control continues to be widely employed in various practical applications. The reasons for the continued popularity and long-evity of PID control can be summarized as follows ( Yamamoto et al., 2009 ): (1) the control structure is relatively simple; (2) the physical meaning of each control gain is clear; and (3) the operators X  know-how can be easily utilized in designing control-ler. According to the above reasons, the attractiveness of PID control is acknowledged. However, the conventional PID control-lers are difficult to obtain satisfactory control performances for highly nonlinear and time-varying systems due to its linear structures with fixed control gains. Therefore, various attempts have been made to enhance the PID controllers such as the self-tuning PID ( Tan et al., 2002 ), PID with wavelet decomposition ( Parvez and Gao, 2005 ), and nonlinear PID ( Parra-Vega et al., 2003 ). Moreover, an open-loop adaptive control (OLAC) method was developed in Burrows et al. (2009 ) which integrates an external control force into a PID controller to compensate the effects of out-of-balance and synchrono us disturbances for any general rotor X  X earing system without ma thematical model. Furthermore, one TAMB are fixed on the platform to suspend and regulate the rotor in the radial and axial DOF, respectively. The positions of the rotor in five-axes are defined as the displacements deviated from the nominal air gaps. Therefore, two pairs of the perpendicular eddy-current position sensors are installed closely to respective
RAMBs to measure the respective radial positions in X  X  Y axes which are denoted as x 1 and y 1 of the left RAMB and x 2 and y 2 of the right RAMB. Moreover, one eddy-current position sensor is installed closely to TAMB to measure the axial position in Z -axis which is denoted as z . After the rotor positions in five-axes are all measured and sent to the control core through the position signals line, the required electromagnet currents are generated from the drive system and circulate the coils through the power line. Therefore, the rotor can be regulated and stabilized in the centers of the apertures of two RAMBs and the thrust disk can be centered in the middle of the air gap of the TAMB, respectively.
The rotor shown in Fig. 1 is with 500 mm long, 16.6 mm diameter, and 2.565 kg weight steel shaft. One 0.5 kg stainless steel mass disk is mounted on the rotor which position can be adjusted to modify the rotational characteristics. Moreover, one 0.38 kg stainless steel load disk can be added in the left end of the rotor as the additional load in a specific operating condition for experimentation. The nominal air gaps in X  X  Y axes of two RAMBs dynamic ( Sahinkaya and Hartavi, 2007 ). On the other hand, the power amplifiers transfer the voltage signals into drive currents to generate electromagnetic forces. To simplify the description, only the left RAMB is analyzed in this section; both the right RAMB and TAMB can be extended easily using the same concepts. Observing Fig. 2 , two pairs of the electromagnetic coils are installed perpendicularly on the U-shaped stators and used to produce the perpendicular attractive electromagnetic forces in response to DC currents. Moreover, all the coils installed in RAMBs are with the same turns and can be considered symme-trical and uncoupled.

The dotted line or solid line of the rotor shown in Fig. 2 means that the rotor is centered in the aperture or deviated from the center in X  X  Y axes, respectively. The nominal air gaps of the RAMBs in X  X  Y axes are denoted by variable x b and y b . Moreover, the deviations from the nominal air gaps of the left RAMB are denoted For example, if the right air gap is measured as x b x 1 and the left air gap is measured as x b  X  x 1 , the rotor position in X -axis can be known as x 1 mm according to the defined X -axis direction. The bias voltage v b is supplied for both pairs of electromagnets to produce the same basic attractive forces in X  X  Y axes. Furthermore, the control voltages for X -axis and Y -axis are v x 1 and v y 1 which are obtained by the respective PIDNN controllers. In addition, the total respectively. Additionally, the total nonlinear attractive electromag-netic forces for X -axis and Y -axis can be modeled as follows ( Schweitzer et al., 1994 ): F F where F x 1 and F y 1 are the total attractive electromagnetic forces in X -axis and Y -axis; f 1 f 4 denote the four radial forces produced by the right, upper, left, and lower electromagnets, respectively; k is the electromagnet constant and can be defined as follows ( Schweitzer et al., 1994 ): k  X  m 0 AN where m 0 is the permeability of air in free space; A is the effective air gap cross-section; N is the number of turns in coils. Observing (1) and (2) , it can be known that the electromagnetic force is proportional to the square of the total currents and inverse to the square of the air gaps. According to the dynamic adjustments of the in the center positions of all five axes without any mechanical contact and friction. 2.3. System modeling By Newton X  X  second law, the dynamic model of the five-DOF AMB system can be obtained according to its structure as follows: m  X  x 1  X  F x 1  X  h x 1 m  X  x 2  X  F x 2  X  h x 2 m  X  y 1  X  F y 1 mg  X  h y 1 m  X  y 2  X  F y 2 mg  X  h y 2 m  X  z  X  F z  X  h z 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : where g is the gravity constant; x 1 and y 1 are the rotor positions of the left RAMB system in X  X  Y axes; x 2 and y 2 are the rotor positions of the right RAMB system in X  X  Y axes; z is the rotor derivative in f -axis. N represents the N th iteration. Moreover, e f d f and _ e f _ f d _ f in which f d and f are the reference and actual rotor positions of f -axis. Furthermore, f d and _ f d are both zero to achieve the purpose of regulating and stabilizing the rotor in the center positions within the air gaps. 3.1.2. Layer 2 (hidden layer)
The inputs of the hidden layer are the performance measures u  X  N  X  which can be represented as: u  X  N  X  X  input layer and hidden layer and can be considered as the different effective gains of the regulating error and its derivative for the performance measures u j ( N ). Moreover, the outputs of the hidden layer o j ( N ) through the respective proportional, integral, and derivative paths can be calculated as follows: o  X  N  X  X  f P  X  u 1  X  N  X  X  X  o  X  N  X  X  f I  X  u 2  X  N  X  X  o 2 N 1  X  X  X  X  where f P , f I , and f D are the proportional, integral, and derivative functions, respectively. One can observe that the structure of the proposed PIDNN is quite compact in which only a few neurons are required in the hidden layer. 3.1.3. Layer 3 (output layer)
In the output layer, the self-connection of the output node is added to achieve better learning efficiency and control performance. 3.2.2. Layer 2
By using the chain rule, the connective weight w 1 ij is updated by the amount: D w 1 ij N  X  X  X  Z W 1 @ E  X  N  X  where the factor Z W 1 is the learning rate for w 1 ij . The connective weight w 1 ij is updated according to the following equation: w ij N  X  1  X  X  X  w 1 ij  X  N  X  X  D w 1 ij  X  N  X  X  15  X 
The exact calculation of the sensitivity of the system @ f ( N )/ @ y f ( N ) is difficult to be determined due to the unknown dynamics of the AMB system. To overcome this problem, a delta adaptation law is adopted as follows ( Lin et al., 2010 ): d ffi f d f  X  X  _ f d _ f  X  X  e f  X  _ e f  X  16  X  3.3. Convergence analysis of proposed PIDNN
Selection of the values for the learning rate parameters has a significant effect on the network performance. In order to train the PIDNN effectively, the varied learning rates, which guarantee the convergence of the regulating error based on the analysis of a discrete-type Lyapunov function ( Chen and Teng, 1995 ), are derived in this section. Consider the energy function E shown in (10) as a discrete-type Lyapunov function, the change in the Lyapunov function can be obtained by D E  X  N  X  X  EN  X  1  X  X  E  X  N  X  X  17  X 
The linearized model of the error equation can be represented by EN  X  1  X  X  X  EN  X  X  X  D EN  X  X  where D E , D w 1 ij , and D w 2 j represent the energy function change, (18) can be represented using (12) and (14) as follows: EN  X  1  X  X  X  EN  X  X  Z W 1 subsystem according to z -axis. Therefore, five PIDNNs are used to construct the decentralized PIDNN controller for controlling five subsystems separately and simultaneously. The bias voltages for radial and axial subsystems are v b and v 0 , respectively. Moreover, the respective control voltages for five subsystems are obtained using respective PIDNNs to achieve the regulating and stabilizing purposes. The advantage of the proposed decentralized PIDNN controller is simplified controller design without using exact system dynamic model.

Due to the improved structure design, the proposed PIDNN possesses fast on-line learning and good dynamic approximation abilities. Therefore, the uncertainties in respective subsystems can be overcome effectively. As a result, the stability of the five-
DOF AMB system can be considered as the independent stabilities of the five subsystems. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the
PIDNN is proved using a discrete-type Lyapunov function to determine the variable learning rates. According to the proposed control scheme and convergence analysis, the position X  X  regulat-ing error of each subsystem can vanish to zero and thereafter the stability of whole system can be guaranteed. 3.5. Advantages of decentralized PIDNN controller
In general, the multi-axes AMB system is controlled by the decentralized PID controller due to its simple structure and easy implementation. However, it is very difficult to achieve high control performance because the decentralized PID controller with fixed control gains can not confront the uncertainties effectively. For this reason, the decentralized PIDNN controller is proposed in this study in which only a few neurons are necessary to obtain the similar PID control features with improved robust-ness. Owning to the adaptive characteristics via on-line learning algorithm and the concise network structure of PIDNN, the proposed decentralized PIDNN controller is very suitable for the five-DOF AMB system in practical applications. 4. Experimental results 4.1. Operating conditions planning
In this study, the control objective is to regulate and stabilize the rotor of the fully suspended five-DOF AMB system in the regulating errors. Moreover, the maximum oscillations in the position responses can be measured by the peak to peak values of the regulating errors. 4.3. Experimentation
The experimental setup for the five-DOF AMB control system including the five-DOF AMB system, five eddy-current position sensors, drive system with DDM and power amplifiers, personal computer (PC) is shown in Fig. 5 . The PC, which is the control core, includes one multi-channels analog-to-digital (AD) card with 16 bits resolution and one multi-channels digital-to-analog (DA) card with 14 bits resolution, respectively. Moreover, the eddy-current position sensors are with low-pass filter for signal noises reduction. The proposed five-DOF AMB control system using decentralized PIDNN controller is realized in the PC using the  X  X  X isual BASIC X  X  language. The methodology proposed for the implementation is composed of main program and control sub-routine. In the main program, parameters and input/output ( I / O ) initialization are set. The control subroutine with 4 kHz sampling rate is used for the eddy-current position sensors interface and the execution of the control algorithm. The control subroutine current position sensors via the AD card. Then, the five control proposed decentralized PIDNN controller and then sent to the drive system via DA card. In the drive system, the DDM extends v  X  v z , and v 0 v z . After that, the ten total currents for five pairs of AMBs are generated from the power amplifiers and circulate the electromagnet coils to produce the total attractive electro-magnetic forces in respective axes.

The bias voltage for RAMBs v b and the bias voltage for TAMB v 0 are set as 1.8 V and 2.2 V, respectively. Moreover, the scaling of the input voltage and the output current of the power amplifier is 0.5 A/V. Furthermore, the control gains of the PID controllers are chosen as follows: K K K where all the gains are chosen by trial and error to achieve the best transient and steady-state control performances in the experimentation considering the requirements of the system stability. On the other hand, the value of parameter e is set as 0.01. In addition, the initial connective weights of the PIDNN controllers are chosen randomly. Then, the connective weights are trained by on-line learning algorithm to be capable of regulating the rotor in the center positions without rotation. After accurate and stable regulating performance is obtained, all these connective weights are saved for the initial formation. After that, the decentralized PIDNN controller with on-line learning algo-rithm uses these pre-trained connective weights as the initial values to evaluate the control performances at three operating conditions.

The experimental results of the fully suspended five-DOF AMB control systems using decentralized PID controller at Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3 during the 0.5 s period are shown in Figs. 6 X 8 , respectively. The rotor orbits of the left and right RAMBs in X  X  Y axes and the rotor position of the TAMB in Z -axis are given. From the experimental results shown in Figs. 6 X 8 ,thefive-DOFAMB control systems are virtually suspended by the decentralized PID controller at Cases 1 X 3. However, there exist steady state errors whose amplitudes are increased with the rotor speed. Moreover, stability and deform the rotor easily if the rotating speed or uncertainties are increased. Furthermore, comparing the left and right orbits at Case 1 shown in Fig. 6 (a) and (b) with the left and right orbits at Case 2 shown in Fig. 7 (a) and (b), the regulating at Case 1 as shown in Fig. 6 . This result indicates that the decentralized PID controller with fixed PID gains is difficult to control the highly nonlinear and unstable five-DOF AMB system with robustness when the uncertainties are serious.
 Remark 2. Many defective factors of the five-DOF AMB system may contribute to non-circular orbits such as manufacturing and assembly errors, elasticity of the rotor shaft, and mass unbalance in the rotor as shown in Figs. 6 X 8 ( Chen et al., 2005 ). Moreover, the uncertainties including external disturbances and inherent nonli-nearities such as coupling effects among five-axes and gyroscopic y directions especially in the high rotational speed ( Schweitzer and Maslen, 2009 ; Chiba et al., 2005 ). For this situation, the different control gains are required to regulate and stabilize the rotor in the center positions within the air gaps considering both the defective factors and the uncertainties. Furthermore, to compensate the gravity of the rotor, the larger control gains are always required for the y -direction suspension as shown in (28).

In order to improve the degraded control performance of the decentralized PID controller, the decentralized PIDNN controller is implemented to control the five-DOF AMB system. The experi-mental results of the fully suspended five-DOF AMB control system using decentralized PIDNN controller at Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3 during the 0.5 s period are shown in Figs. 9 X 11 , respectively. The maximum run outs in X  X  Y axes considering both RAMBs are 0.16 mm, 0.19 mm, and 0.22 mm at Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, respectively. Comparing with the maximum run outs using decentralized PID controller, all the values are improved effectively. On the other hand, the regulating performances of the TAMB in Z -axis using decentralized PIDNN controller are also more stable in comparison with the ones using decentralized PID controller. Moreover, the control performances at Cases 1 X 3 as shown in Figs. 9 X 11 are very similar which indicates that the proposed decentralized PIDNN controller is capable of dealing with the uncertainties including the additional load disk and the increased rotating speed. Therefore, the robustness of the fully suspended five-DOF AMB control system using decentralized PIDNN controller under the occurrence of uncertainties for all test conditions can be clearly observed.

Though both decentralized PID and PIDNN controllers can regulate the rotor around the bearing centerline at three operating conditions, the small steady-state errors are unavoidable whose frequencies are the same as the rotor speed and the amplitudes are increased with the rotor speed ( Sivrioglu, 2007 ; Chen et al., 2005 ; Lu et al., 2008 ). The reasons include the defective mechanistic factors such as manufacturing and assembly errors, elasticity of the rotor shaft, and mass unbalance in the rotor ( Chen et al., 2005 ), perpetual system uncertainties such as external disturbance, cou-pling effects among five-axes and gyroscopic effects of the rotation ( Schweitzer and Maslen, 2009 ; Chiba et al., 2005 ), and the limita-tion of digital implementation such as the finite control frequency, sampling error and inaccuracy between required control force and practical electromagnetic force. Therefore, the small steady-state errors are always existent in the practical experimentation.
To further investigative the improved control performance of the five-DOF AMB control system using decentralized PIDNN controller, the performance measures of the RMS values and peak shown in Tables 1 X 3 , respectively. According to the performance measures, all the RMS values and peak to peak values of five-DOF AMB control system using decentralized PID controller are reduced by the decentralized PIDNN controller. Therefore, the proposed decentralized PIDNN controller possesses good control ability to confront the uncertainties. system using decentralized PIDNN controller to regulate and stabilize the rotor in the center positions of all five axes. First, the structure and operating principles of the five-DOF AMB system was introduced. Then, the adopted DDM was analyzed using left RAMB as an example. Moreover, a decentralized PIDNN controller is proposed to control the five-DOF AMB system with-out exact dynamic model. Furthermore, the connective weights of the PIDNN are trained on-line by BP methodology and the convergence analysis of the regulating error is provided using Acknowledgments
