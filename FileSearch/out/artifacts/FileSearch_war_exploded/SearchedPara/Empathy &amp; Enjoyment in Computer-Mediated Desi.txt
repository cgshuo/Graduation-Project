 While there have been vast theoretical and pragmatic advances in the field of CSCW, significant que stions still remain about what makes for a successful distance collaboration, particularly in the field of design. Through an experi mental design, this research examines the role that empathy and related psychological constructs may play in the experiences of designers working at a distance. Findings show that in fact empathy does matter, and may affect both the enjoyment of the experience and the efficiency with which the designe rs work. This study shows a link between empathy and empathic c onstructs, and the outcomes of computer mediated distance design collaborations. H.1.2 [ Information Systems ]: User-Machine Systems -software psychology, human information processing, human factors. Design, Human Factors. The specific type of collaborative work on which this research will focus is Web design, including development. Most Web design for smaller businesses or organizations utilizes several people, each with a different specialty, working together to create a singular experience for an end user. In these collaborations, there must be clear, detailed, and precise communication around the graphical, structural, and technical elements of the design. If unresolved miscommunications occur, the site may be difficult to use, have gaps in information or process, or simply not work at all. The design team or any subset of the team must be able to brainstorm creative ideas, hash out conflicting approaches to a design, and speak to each other on both a high level concerning overall site usability and appeal, and on a low level concerning details like how a checkout process might flow. This requires a kind of collaborative work that must go beyond simple task division. Because of the need for this nuanced and complex type of collaboration in order to successfully complete this type of work, it becomes apparent why this type of work when done at a distance may require an optimi zed mode of CMC. Optimizing CMC for these teams may include understanding how important it is for team members to be able to feel along with, or empathize with, one another during the periods of intense collaboration. Research has shown that empathy can be transmitted and felt via CMC in distance therapist/patie nt relationships (e.g. [1]). Additionally, it may be tentatively extrapolated that empathy is transferred in CMC-based online dating scenarios and in friendships formed and maintained online (e.g. [2]). Hence it is reasonable to believe that CMC technology would not necessarily  X  X lock X  the transfer and feeling of empathy between members of a design team working at a dist ance, should empathy exist in those relationships naturally. Given this, the present research asks whether design teams where member s have higher levels of trait empathy enjoy a more positive experience working together, and if their task efficiency differs from teams where members have lower levels of trait empathy. It also investigates the output of Empathy is quite slippery to de fine. Often it is conflated with sympathy, and may be hard to distinguish from other concepts including liking, pity, guilt, etc. [3]. It exists on two levels, cognitive and affective. Cognitive empathy refers to the thinking, consciously aware manifestations of the phenomenon (e.g. I see that you are upset, I can understand cognitively that you are upset, and I too feel upset because of your situation and your emotions) while affective addresses the more visceral, unconscious manifestations (e.g. I see you bei ng upset and just the sight of it gives me an immediate pang of distress) [4]. Because of the breadth of the theoretical and ope rational definitions of empathy, this paper will use a basic but us eful definition, defining empathy as the understanding and feeling of what another person is feeling and thinking [5]. This definition includes the ideas of both cognitive and affective empathy, both of which may be of use in creating more productive, enjoyable work teams. Two empathy scales were used in this research. The first is the 28-item Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), which utilizes a multidimensional approach to empathy, bridging the debate between empathy as a cognitive phenomenon and empathy as an affective phenomenon [7]. The s econd scale used is the 40-item Basic Empathy Scale, or BES [8]. This scale, like the IRI, takes a multidimensional approach to empathy and defines it as having both cognitive and affective components. The study engaged 48 underg raduate web design-savvy participants divided into 24 team s of two individuals. These pairs of participants were tasked with creating a small web site for a nearby chapter of Habitat for Humanity, anonymously working together only via CMC. Pairs were determined by first matching individuals whose schedules would allow them to work together, then matching them by empathy sc ore and assigning them to three groups  X  high empathy, low empath y, and mixed empathy (where one team member was high and one was low). Over the course of ten hours, the pairs  X  X et X  online using code names to preserve anonymity, completed a crossword puzzle task both before and after the collaboration, designed, developed, and posted their sites, and completed a follow-up crossword task and questionnaire. Adding a $100 prize ($50 per teammate) to the top three projects, as judged by the c lient, encouraged participants to put in effort toward creating a quality product. Each participant was assigned a unique anonymizing identifier incorporated into a Gmail account. Gmail was used for its capacity for instant messaging, emailing, a nd document sharing. The teams completed the empathy scales in advance of their experimental session, and upon thei r first  X  X eeting X  with their partner completed a divided crossw ord task. An equivalent task was given again at the end of th eir collaboration. After the teams completed their projects and turned in all materials, they were asked to complete a follow-up questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered securely via the web and included several scales and measures. The first, a sligh tly modified version of the Job Satisfaction Survey (Bellingham, 2004), asked questions regarding their enjoyment of the task, their enjoyment of working with their partner, and their desire to ever work at a distance again. It also asked several ques tions about the procedure itself, including whether they may have accidentally revealed their identities to each other, and if any technical problems occurred that hampered their ability to collaborate. Also at this time, the BES and IRI were given again. Finally, the participants were given the homophily scale to gain insight into how much alike they believe their partner to be to themselves. This is important given the literature showing that empathy is highly correlated with affinity or perceived affinity. The experimental study exposed useful correlations between various aspects of participant tr aits and experience with working on a design project via CMC. It seems that indeed it may be the case that elements of empath y, homophily, and self-monitoring may influence the level to which an individual enjoys the interpersonal of a collabora tive CMC design project. These differences and influences are important for researchers in this field to be aware, as they are pi eces in the complex puzzle of what makes a successful CMC collaboration. While teams X  productivity and efficiency may be the most obvious concern, the extent to which they are enjoying their work is also an important considerati on. Few people would want to stay in a situation where they dislike their teammates, projects, and work environment. In light of that, enjoyment measures used provide useful findings both in conjunction with and independent of those findings related to tasks. Higher reported partner enjoyment correlated positively with performance on crossword two and with the improvement (delta) between crosswords one and two. This could mean that a good performance on crossword two would cause an individual to report liking her partner more, a nd that a notable improvement between the first and the second crossword tasks would also make an individual report liking her part ner more. This underscores the importance of creating and maintaining positive work relationships in a CMC context, as it may well affect designers X  ability to complete tasks. This same correlation could also mean that enjoying one X  X  partner more leads to greater improvement on a repeated measures task, and greater overall success on a task once one has gotten to know (and like) one X  X  partner. While this latter explanation can not be ruled out, it would seem likely that good performance on a task woul d boost one X  X  overall mood and cause him to report more positively on all three enjoyment aspects measured  X  partner, project, and overall enjoyment. Here, only partner enjoyment was positively correlated with task success. Because of this, the first explanation stating that the correlation is likely a sign that partner enjoyment can positively affect task performance seems more feasible. For partners with higher IRI sc ore variance between them, their performance on crossword two was significantly poorer than partners whose IRI scores were more similar to one another. Because there was no such effect on the first of the tasks, given at the beginning of the experiments be fore the pairs had started work on their projects, and because there was no direct effect for straight high or low empathy, it may be the case that the similarity in empathy allowed the pairs to develop a more effective working relationship throughout the course of the week-long project. Overall, it does seem that empath y and its related constructs can have various effects on the out comes of a computer-mediated design collaboration. These e ffects may be based on overall empathy, the variance between pa rtners in a collaboration, or constructs relating to empathy. Regardless, the role of empathy in computer mediated design collaborations is noteworthy and warrants consideration and further investigation.
