 The goal of the 3rd BooksOnline Workshop is to bring to-gether researchers and industry practitioners in information retrieval, digital libraries, e-books, human computer interac-tion, publishing industry, and online book services to foster progress on addressing challenges and exploring opportuni-ties around large collections of digital books and complemen-tary media. Towards this goal, the workshop programme consists of contributions both from academia and industry, including two keynote talks: James Crawford from Google Books and John Mark Ockerbloom from the University of Pennsylvania.

The BooksOnline workshop series is motivated by the dra-matic increase in the availability of digital book content through the digitization of physical books and electronic publishing. Such collections present a great value to hu-manity and are also attractive to commercial organizations. However, in contrast to the great momentum in creating on-line book repositories, there is a lack of research initiatives that are focused on innovation opportunities and challenges created by these large collections. To address this need, the workshop series aims to foster a professional network by bringing together researchers and industry practitioners and to build support for joint initiatives in research, design, and technology.
 BooksOnline X 10 follows on from two previous workshops: BooksOnline X 08 [4] held at CIKM 2008, and BooksOnline X 09 [5] held at ECDL 2009. Through these workshops, the Book-sOnline community has been gaining strength and momen-tum in the past two years. At BooksOnline X 08, a research agenda was defined covering three fundamental areas: 1) En-riched digital collections, 2) Usage scenarios and user expe-rience, and 3) Content representation and discover services. BooksOnline X 09 focused on more concrete actions around joint project ideas in the areas of 1) Design and interaction book collections and for the evaluation of the applications and services that make use of such collections, and 2) Oppor-tunities relating to social or collaborative reading and anno-tation of books and issues relating to the design of suitable eReaders. We summarise these below.
Snelgrove and Baecker [14] propose a collaborative reading environment for digital books, specifically designed for the partially sighted. The system allows users to record the audio of a book being read aloud, which is synchronized with the text. The partially sighted individual can then revisit the text using a tablet-based touchscreen interface.
Ribi`ere, Picault and Squedin [12] describe a set of con-cepts and features, such as heat maps and social annota-tions summaries, to make e-books more social in order to sustain students in a learning activity, and leverage collec-tive intelligence from social interactions to make students X  learning experience more efficient. They propose to implic-itly connect people through the sharing of a given e-book in a spontaneous social network.

Pearson and Buchanan [10] present a real-time collabo-rative annotation system for reading groups that uses a set of iPads. Since collaboration in their scenario occurs over multiple copies of the same document, viewed on individual iPads, they also introduce a new tool that allows group mem-bers to  X  X oint out X  information within a document to other members without physically gesturing with their hands.
In [11], Pearson, Buchanan and Thimbleby argue for the need to take a scientific standpoint adopting basic HCI prin-ciples to think about eReader design, providing a wider range of insights than what has become the conventional mode of HCI based on empirical experiments. They de-tail guidelines for good eReader design and illustrate these with examples of shortcomings of some of the more popular eReader devices on the market today.

Bonacho [1] provides a close examination of the skills and abilities needed to interact with e-books on Biblioteca de Livros Digitais (BLD) with the aim to answer deep reaching questions regarding the nature of the reading and compre-hension processes on BLD and their implications for today X  X  literacies.
In [13], Siemens and Meloni report on the first year work of the INKE research group, a large international, interdis-ciplinary research team studying reading and texts, both digital and printed, as part of a seven-year project. They discuss the methodological and infrastructural groundwork they laid, including a textual features knowledge-base, user experience studies, a model of chaining in professional read-ing practices, and building test corpora in English and French.
Caidi and Lam [2] describe the On-Demand Book Service (ODBS), a collaboration between First Nations communities in Northern Ontario and the University of Toronto. The aim of the ODBS is to bridge the gap between physical and digital libraries. Using the ODBS as a case study, they share their experiences relating them to three themes: sensitivity to social context, designing across cultural boundaries, and the integration of content and service.

Landoni [7] discusses the importance of evaluation for the
