 Structural information retrieval is mostly based on hierar-chy. However, in real life information is not purely hier-archical and structural elements may overlap each other. The most common example is a document with two distinct structural views, where the logical view is section/ sub-section/ paragraph and the physical view is page/ line . Each single structural view of this document is a hierarchy and the components are either disjoint or nested inside each other. The overlapping issue arises when one structural el-ement cannot be neatly nested into others. For instance, when a paragraph starts in one page and terminates in the next page. Similar situations can appear in videos and other multimedia contents, where temporal or spatial constituents of a media file may overlap each other.

Querying over overlapping structures is one of the chal-lenges of large scale search engines. For instance, FSIS (FAST Search for Internet Sites) [1] is a Microsoft search platform, which encounters overlaps while analysing con-tent of textual data. FSIS uses a pipeline process to extract structure and semantic information of documents. The pipe-line contains several components, where each component writes annotations to the input data. These annotations consist of structural elements and some of them may over-lap each other. Handling overlapping structures in search engines will add a novel capability of searching, where users can ask queries such as  X  X ind all the words that overlap two lines X  or  X  X ind the music played during Intro scene of Avatar movie X . There are also other use cases, where the user of the search engine is not a person, but is a specific program with complex, non-traditional information retrieval needs.
This research attempts to index overlapping structures and provide efficient query processing for large-scale search engines. The current research on overlapping structures re-volves around encoding and modelling data, while indexing and query processing methods need investigations. More-over, due to intrinsic complexity of overlaps, XML indexing and query processing techniques cannot be used for overlap-
