 Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a widely stud-ied task in natural language processing: given a word and its context, assign the correct sense of the word based on a pre-defined sense inventory (Kilgarrif, 1998). WSD is useful for a range of NLP tasks, including information retrieval, information extrac-tion, machine translation, content analysis, and lex-icography (see Navigli (2009) for an overview). Figure 1: Visual sense ambiguity: three of the senses of the verb play .
 Standard WSD disambiguates words based on their textual context ; however, in a multimodal setting (e.g., newspaper articles with photographs), visual context is also available and can be used for disam-biguation. Based on this observation, we introduce a new task, visual sense disambiguation (VSD) for verbs: given an image and a verb, assign the correct sense of the verb, i.e., the one depicted in the image. While VSD approaches for nouns exist, VSD for verbs is a novel, more challenging task, and related in interesting ways to action recognition in computer vision. As an example consider the verb play , which can have the senses participate in sport , play on an instrument , and be engaged in playful activity , de-pending on its visual context, see Figure 1.
We expect visual sense disambiguation to be use-ful for multimodal tasks such as image retrieval. As an example consider the output of Google Image Search for the query sit : it recognizes that the verb has multiple senses and tries to cluster relevant im-ages. However, the result does not capture the pol-ysemy of the verb well, and would clearly benefit from VSD (see Figure 2).

Visual sense disambiguation has previously been attempted for nouns (e.g., apple can mean fruit or computer ), which is a substantially easier task that can be solved with the help of an object detector Figure 2: Google Image Search trying to disam-biguate sit . All clusters pertain to the sit down sense, other senses ( baby sit , convene ) are not included. (Barnard et al., 2003; Loeff et al., 2006; Saenko and Darrell, 2008; Chen et al., 2015). VSD for nouns is helped by resources such as ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), a large image database containing 1.4 million images for 21,841 noun synsets and organized ac-cording to the WordNet hierarchy. However, we are not aware of any previous work on VSD for verbs, and no ImageNet for verbs exists. Not only image retrieval would benefit from VSD for verbs, but also other multimodal tasks that have recently received a lot of interest, such as automatic image descrip-tion and visual question answering (Karpathy and Li, 2015; Fang et al., 2015; Antol et al., 2015).
In this work, we explore the new task of visual sense disambiguation for verbs: given an image and a verb, assign the correct sense of the verb, i.e., the one that describes the action depicted in the image. We present VerSe, a new dataset that augments exist-ing multimodal datasets (COCO and TUHOI) with sense labels. VerSe contains 3518 images, each an-notated with one of 90 verbs, and the OntoNotes sense realized in the image. We propose an algo-rithm based on the Lesk WSD algorithm in order to perform unsupervised visual sense disambiguation on our dataset. We focus in particular on how to best represent word senses for visual disambiguation, and explore the use of textual, visual, and multi-modal embeddings. Textual embeddings for a given image can be constructed over object labels or image descriptions, which are available as gold-standard in the COCO and TUHOI datasets, or can be computed automatically using object detectors and image de-scription models.

Our results show that textual embeddings per-form best when gold-standard textual annotations are available, while multimodal embeddings per-form best when automatically generated object la-bels are used. Interestingly, we find that automati-cally generated image descriptions result in inferior performance.
 Table 1: Comparison of VerSe with existing action recognition datasets. Acts (actions) are verb-object pairs; Sen indicates whether sense ambiguity is ex-plicitly handled; Des indicates whether image de-scriptions are included. There is an extensive literature on word sense disam-biguation for nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Most of these approaches rely on lexical databases or sense inventories such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) or OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006). Unsuper-vised WSD approaches often rely on distributional representations, computed over the target word and its context (Lin, 1997; McCarthy et al., 2004; Brody and Lapata, 2008). Most supervised approaches use sense annotated corpora to extract linguistic features of the target word (context words, POS tags, col-location features), which are then fed into a classi-fier to disambiguate test data (Zhong and Ng, 2010). Recently, features based on sense-specific seman-tic vectors learned using large corpora and a sense inventory such as WordNet have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results for supervised WSD (Rothe and Schutze, 2015; Jauhar et al., 2015).
As mentioned in the introduction, all existing work on visual sense disambiguation has used nouns, starting with Barnard et al. (2003). Sense dis-crimination for web images was introduced by Lo-eff et al. (2006), who used spectral clustering over multimodal features from the images and web text. Saenko and Darrell (2008) used sense definitions in a dictionary to learn a latent LDA space overs senses, which they then used to construct sense-specific classifiers by exploiting the text surrounding an image. 2.1 Related Datasets Most of the datasets relevant for verb sense disam-biguation were created by the computer vision com-munity for the task of human action recognition (see Table 1 for an overview). These datasets are anno-tated with a limited number of actions, where an action is conceptualized as verb-object pair: ride horse , ride bicycle , play tennis , play guitar , etc. Verb sense ambiguity is ignored in almost all action recognition datasets, which misses important gener-alizations: for instance, the actions ride horse and ride bicycle represent the same sense of ride and thus share visual, textual, and conceptual features, while this is not the case for play tennis and play guitar . This is the issue we address by creating a dataset with explicit sense labels.
 VerSe is built on top of two existing datasets, TUHOI and COCO. The Trento Universal Human-Object Interaction (TUHOI) dataset contains 10,805 images covering 2974 actions. Action (human-object interaction) categories were annotated using crowdsourcing: each image was labeled by multiple annotators with a description in the form of a verb or a verb-object pair. The main drawback of TUHOI is that 1576 out of 2974 action categories occur only once, limiting its usefulness for VSD. The Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset is very popular in the language/vision community, as it con-sists of over 120k images with extensive annotation, including labels for 91 object categories and five de-scriptions per image. COCO contains no explicit ac-tion annotation, but verbs and verb phrases can be extracted from the descriptions. (But note that not all the COCO images depict actions.) The recently created Humans Interacting with Common Objects (HICO) dataset is conceptually similar to VerSe. It consists of 47774 images anno-tated with 111 verbs and 600 human-object interac-tion categories. Unlike other existing datasets, HICO uses sense-based distinctions: actions are denoted by sense-object pairs, rather than by verb-object pairs. HICO doesn X  X  aim for complete coverage, but re-stricts itself to the top three WordNet senses of a verb. The dataset would be suitable for performing visual sense disambiguation, but has so far not been used in this way. We want to build an unsupervised visual sense dis-ambiguation system, i.e., a system that takes an im-age and a verb and returns the correct sense of the verb. As discussed in Section 2.1, most exist-Figure 3: Example item for depictability and sense annotation: synset definitions and examples (in blue) for the verb touch . ing datasets are not suitable for this task, as they do not include word sense annotation. We therefore de-velop our own dataset with gold-standard sense an-notation. The Verb Sense (VerSe) dataset is based on COCO and TUHOI and covers 90 verbs and around 3500 images. VerSe serves two main purposes: (1) to show the feasibility of annotating images with verb senses (rather than verbs or actions); (2) to function as test bed for evaluating automatic visual sense dis-ambiguation methods.
 Verb Selection Action recognition datasets often use a limited number of verbs (see Table 1). We ad-dressed this issue by using images that come with descriptions, which in the case of action images typ-ically contain verbs. The COCO dataset includes im-ages in the form of sentences, the TUHOI dataset is annotated with verbs or prepositional verb phrases for a given object (e.g., sit on chair), which we use in lieu of descriptions. We extracted all verbs from all the descriptions in the two datasets and then selected those verbs that have more than one sense in the OntoNotes dictionary, which resulted in 148 verbs in total (94 from COCO and 133 from TUHOI).
 Depictability Annotation A verb can have mul-tiple senses, but not all of them may be depictable, e.g., senses describing cognitive and perception pro-cesses. Consider two senses of touch : make physical contact is depictable, whereas affect emotionally de-scribes a cognitive process and is not depictable. We therefore need to annotate the synsets of a verb as depictable or non-depictable. Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers were presented with the def-initions of all the synsets of a verb, along with ex-Table 2: Overview of VerSe dataset divided into motion and non-motion verbs; Depct: depictable senses; ITA: inter-annotator agreement. amples, as given by OntoNotes. An example for this annotation is shown in Figure 3. We used OntoNotes instead of WordNet, as WordNet senses are very fine-grained and potentially make depictability and sense annotation (see below) harder. Granularity is-sues with WordNet for text-based WSD are well documented (Navigli, 2009).

OntoNotes lists a total of 921 senses for our 148 target verbs. For each synset, three AMT workers selected all depictable senses. The majority label was used as the gold standard for subsequent ex-periments. This resulted in a 504 depictable senses. Inter-annotator agreement (ITA) as measured by Fleiss X  Kappa was 0 . 645.
 Sense Annotation We then annotated a subset of the images in COCO and TUHOI with verb senses. For every image we assigned the verb that occurs most frequently in the descriptions for that image (for TUHOI, the descriptions are verb-object pairs, see above). However, many verbs are represented by only a few images, while a few verbs are rep-resented by a large number of images. The datasets therefore show a Zipfian distribution of linguistic units, which is expected and has been observed pre-viously for COCO (Ronchi and Perona, 2015). For sense annotation, we selected only verbs for which either COCO or TUHOI contained five or more im-ages, resulting in a set of 90 verbs (out of the to-tal 148). All images for these verbs were included, giving us a dataset of 3518 images: 2340 images for 82 verbs from COCO and 1188 images for 61 verbs from TUHOI (some verbs occur in both datasets).
These image-verb pairs formed the basis for sense annotation. AMT workers were presented with the image and all the depictable OntoNotes senses of the associated verb. The workers had to chose the sense of the verb that was instantiated in the image (or  X  X one of the above X , in the case of irrelevant im-ages). Annotators were given sense definitions and examples, as for the depictability annotation (see Figure 3). For every image-verb pair, five annotators performed the sense annotation task. A total of 157 annotators participated, reaching an inter-annotator agreement of 0 . 659 (Fleiss X  Kappa). Out of 3528 im-ages, we discarded 18 images annotated with  X  X one of the above X , resulting in a set of 3510 images cov-ering 90 verbs and 163 senses. We present statis-tics of our dataset in Table 2; we group the verbs into motion verbs and non-motion verb using Levin (1993) classes. For our disambiguation task, we assume we have a set of images I , and a set of polysemous verbs V and each image i  X  I is paired with a verb v  X  V . For example, Figure 1 shows different images paired with the verb play . Every verb v  X  V , has a set of senses S ( v ) , described in a dictionary D . Now given an image i paired with a verb v , our task is to pre-dict the correct sense  X  s  X  S ( v ) , i.e., the sense that is depicted by the associated image. Formulated as a scoring task, disambiguation consists of finding the maximum over a suitable scoring function  X  : For example, in Figure 1, the correct sense for the first image is participate in sport , for the second one it is play on an instrument , etc.

The Lesk (1986) algorithm is a well known knowledge-based approach to WSD which relies on the calculation of the word overlap between the sense definition and the context in which a word oc-curs. It is therefore an unsupervised approach, i.e., it does not require sense-annotated training data, but instead exploits resources such as dictionaries or on-tologies to infer the sense of a word in context. Lesk uses the following scoring function to disambiguate the sense of a verb v : Here, context ( v ) the set of words that occur close the target word v and definition ( s , D ) is the set of words in the definition of sense s in the dictionary D . Lesk X  X  approach is very sensitive to the exact word-ing of definitions and results are known to change dramatically for different sets of definitions (Nav-igli, 2009). Also, sense definitions are often very Figure 4: Schematic overview of the visual sense disambiguation model. short and do not provide sufficient vocabulary or context.

We propose a new variant of the Lesk algorithm to disambiguate the verb sense that is depicted in an image. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of textual, visual and multimodal representations in conjunction with Lesk. An overview of our method-ology is given in Figure 4. For a given image i la-beled with verb v (here play ), we create a represen-tation (the vector i ), which can be text-based (using the object labels and descriptions for i ), visual, or multimodal. Similarly, we create text-based, visual, and multimodal representations (the vector s ) for ev-ery sense s of a verb. Based on the representations i and s (detailed below), we can then score senses as: 1 Note that this approach is unsupervised: it requires no sense annotated training data; we will use the sense annotations in our VerSe dataset only for eval-uation. 4.1 Sense Representations For each candidate verb sense, we create a text-based sense representation s t and a visual sense rep-resentation s c .
 Text-based Sense Representation We create a vector s t for every sense s  X  S ( v ) of a verb v from its definition and the example usages provided in Figure 5: Extracting visual sense representation for the verb play . the OntoNotes dictionary D . We apply word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), a widely used model of word embeddings, to obtain a vector for every content word in the definition and examples of the sense. We then take the average of these vectors to com-pute an overall representation of the verb sense. For our experiments we used the pre-trained 300 dimen-sional vectors available with the word2vec package (trained on part of Google News dataset, about 100 billion words).
 Visual Sense Representation Sense dictionaries typically provide sense definitions and example sen-tences, but no visual examples or images. For nouns, this is remedied by ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), which provides a large number of example images for a subset of the senses in the WordNet noun hier-archy. However, no comparable resource is available for verbs (see Section 2.1).

In order to obtain visual sense representation s c , we therefore collected sense-specific images for the verbs in our dataset. For each verb sense s , three trained annotators were presented with the definition and examples from OntoNotes, and had to formulate a query Q ( s ) that would retrieve images depicting the verb sense when submitted to a search engine. For every query q we retrieved images I ( q ) using Bing image search (for examples, see Figure 5). We used the top 50 images returned by Bing for every query.

Once we have images for every sense, we can turn these images into feature representations us-ing a convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifi-cally, we used the VGG 16-layer architecture (VG-GNet) trained on 1.2M images of the 1000 class ILSVRC 2012 object classification dataset, a subset of ImageNet (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014). This CNN model has a top-5 classification error of 7.4% on ILSVRC 2012. We use the publicly available ref-erence model implemented using CAFFE (Jia et al., 2014) to extract the output of the fc7 layer, i.e., a 4096 dimensional vector c i , for every image i . We perform mean pooling over all the images extracted using all the queries of a sense to generate a single visual sense representation s c (shown in Equation 4): where n is the total number of images retrieved per sense s . 4.2 Image Representations We first explore the possibility of representing the image indirectly, viz., through text associated with it in the form of object labels or image descriptions (as shown in Figure 4). We experiment with two differ-ent forms of textual annotation: GOLD annotation, where object labels and descriptions are provided by human annotators, and predicted (PRED) anno-tation, where state-of-the-art object recognition and image description generation systems are applied to the image.
 Object Labels (O) GOLD object annotations are provided with the two datasets we use. Each im-age sampled from COCO is annotated with one or more of 91 object categories. Each image from TUHOI is annotated with one more of 189 object categories. PRED object annotations were generated using the same VGG-16-layer CNN object recogni-tion model that was used to compute visual sense representations. Only object labels with object de-tection threshold of t &gt; 0 . 2 were used. Descriptions (C) To obtain GOLD image descrip-tions, we used the used human-generated descrip-tions that come with COCO. For TUHOI images, we generated descriptions of the form subject-verb-object, where the subject is always person , and the verb-object pairs are the action labels that come with TUHOI. To obtain PRED descriptions, we generated three descriptions for every image using the state-of-the-art image description system of Vinyals et al.
We can now create a textual representation i t of the image i . Again, we used word2vec to obtain word embeddings, but applied these to the object la-bels and to the words in the image descriptions. An overall representation of the image is then computed by averaging these vectors over all labels, all content words in the description, or both.

Creating a visual representation i c of an image i is straightforward: we extract the fc7 layer of the VGG-16 network when applied to the image and use the resulting vector as our image representation (same setup as in Section 4.1).

Apart from experimenting with separate textual and visual representations of images, it also makes sense to combine the two modalities into a multi-modal representation. The simplest approach is a concatenation model which appends textual and vi-sual features. More complex multimodal vectors can be created using methods such as Canonical Corre-lation Analysis (CCA) and Deep Canonical Corre-lation Analysis (DCCA) (Hardoon et al., 2004; An-drew et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015). CCA allows us to find a latent space in which the linear projections of text and image vectors are maximally correlated (Gong et al., 2014; Hodosh et al., 2015). DCCA can be seen as non-linear version of CCA and has been successfully applied to image description task (Yan and Mikolajczyk, 2015), outperforming previous ap-proaches, including kernel-based CCA.

We use both CCA and DCCA to map the vectors joint latent space of n dimensions. We represent the projected vectors of textual and visual features for image i as i t 0 and i c 0 and combine them to obtain multimodal representation i m as follows: We experimented with a number of parameter set-tings for  X  t and  X  c for textual and visual models re-spectively. We use the same model to combine the multimodal representation for sense s as follows: as described in Equation 3 to perform sense disam-biguation. 5.1 Unsupervised Setup To train the CCA and DCCA models, we use the text representations learned from image descriptions of COCO and Flickr30k dataset as one view and the VGG-16 features from the respective images as the second view. We divide the data into train, test and development samples (using a 80/10/10 split). We observed that the correlation scores for DCCA model were better than for the CCA model. We use the trained models to generate the projected rep-resentations of text and visual features for the im-ages in VerSe. Once the textual and visual features are projected, we then merge them to get the multi-modal representation. We experimented with differ-ent ways of combining visual and textual features projected using CCA or DCCA: (1) weighted in-terpolation of textual and visual features (see Equa-tions 5 and 6), and (2) concatenating the vectors of textual and visual features.

To evaluate our proposed method, we compare against the first sense heuristic, which defaults to the sense listed first in the dictionary (where senses are typically ordered by frequency). This is a strong baseline which is known to outperform more com-plex models in traditional text-based WSD. In VerSe we observe skewness in the distribution of the senses and the first sense heuristic is as strong as over text. Also the most frequent sense heuristic, which as-signs the most frequently annotated sense for a given verb in VerSe, shows very strong performance. It is supervised (as it requires sense annotated data to ob-tain the frequencies), so it should be regarded as an upper limit on the performance of the unsupervised methods we propose (also, in text-based WSD, the most frequent sense heuristic is considered an upper limit, Navigli (2009)). 5.1.1 Results
In Table 3, we summarize the results of the gold-standard (GOLD) and predicted (PRED) settings for motion and non-motion verbs across represen-tations. In the GOLD setting we find that for both types of verbs, textual representations based on im-age descriptions (C) outperform visual representa-tions (CNN features). The text-based results com-pare favorably to the original Lesk (as described in Equation 2), which performs at 30.7 for motion verbs and 36.2 for non-motion verbs in the GOLD setting. This improvement is clearly due to the use visual features alone performed better than gold-standard object labels alone in the case of motion verbs.

We also observed that adding visual features to textual features improves performance in some cases: multimodal features perform better than tex-tual features alone both for object labels (CNN+O) and for image descriptions (CNN+C). However, adding CNN features to textual features based on object labels and descriptions together (CNN+O+C) resulted in a small decrease in performance. Further-more, we note that CCA models outperform simple vector concatenation in case of GOLD setting for motion verbs, and overall DCCA performed consid-erably worse than concatenation. Note that for CCA and DCCA we report the best performing scores achieved using weighted interpolation of textual and visual features with weights  X  t = 0 . 5 and  X  c = 0 . 5.
When comparing to our baseline and upper limit, we find that the all the GOLD models which use descriptions-based representations (except DCCA) outperform to the first sense heuristic for motion-verbs (accuracy 70.8), whereas they performed be-low the first sense heuristic in case of non-motion verbs (accuracy 80.6). As expected, both motion and non-motion verbs performed significantly below the most frequent sense heuristic (accuracy 86.2 and 90.7 respectively), which we argued provides an up-per limit for unsupervised approaches.

We now turn the PRED configuration, i.e., to re-sults obtained using object labels and image descrip-tions predicted by state-of-the-art automatic sys-tems. This is arguably the more realistic scenario, as it only requires images as input, rather than as-suming human-generated object labels and image descriptions (though object detection and image de-scription systems are required instead). In the PRED setting, we find that textual features based on ob-

Combining textual and visual features via concatenation improves perfor-mance for both motion and non-motion verbs. The overall best performance of 72.6 for predicted fea-tures is obtained by combining CNN features and embeddings based on object labels and outperforms first sense heuristic in case of motion verbs (accu-racy 70.8). In the PRED setting for both classes of verbs the simpler concatenation model performed better than the more complex CCA and DCCA mod-els. Note that for CCA and DCCA we report the best performing scores achieved using weighted interpo-lation of textual and visual features with weights  X  = 0 . 3 and  X  c = 0 . 7. Overall, our findings are con-sistent with the intuition that motion verbs are easier to disambiguate than non-motion verbs, as they are Non-Motion verbs (19), FS: 71.3, MFS: 80.0 Features GOLD PRED O 79.1 48.6 78.2 46.0 C 79.1 53.9 77.3 61.7 O+C 79.1 66.0 77.3 55.6 CNN 80.0 55.6 80.0 55.6 CNN+O 80.0 56.5 80.0 52.1 CNN+C 80.0 56.5 80.3 60.0 CNN+O+C 80.0 59.1 80.0 55.6 Table 5: Accuracy scores for non-motion verbs for both supervised and unsupervised approaches using different types of sense and image representation features. more depictable and more likely to involve objects. Note that this is also reflected in the higher inter-annotator agreement for motion verbs (see Table 2). 5.2 Supervised Experiments and Results Along with the unsupervised experiments we inves-tigated the performance of textual and visual repre-sentations of images in a simplest supervised setting. We trained logistic regression classifiers for sense prediction by dividing the images in VerSe dataset into train and test splits. To train the classifiers we selected all the verbs which has atleast 20 images an-notated and has at least two senses in VerSe. This re-sulted in 19 motion verbs and 19 non-motion verbs. Similar to our unsupervised experiments we explore multimodal features by using both textual and visual features for classification (similar to concatenation in unsupervised experiments). Table 6: Images that were assigned an incorrect sense in the PRED setting.

In Table 4 we report accuracy scores for 19 mo-tion verbs using a supervised logistic regression classifier and for comparison we also report the scores of our proposed unsupervised algorithm for both GOLD and PRED setting. Similarly in Table 5 we report the accuracy scores for 19 non-motion verbs. We observe that all supervised classifiers for both motion and non-motion verbs performing bet-ter than first sense baseline. Similar to our findings using an unsupervised approach we find that in most cases multimodal features obtained using concate-nating textual and visual features has outperformed textual or visual features alone especially in the PRED setting which is arguably the more realistic scenario. We observe that the features from PRED image descriptions showed better results for non-motion verbs for both supervised and unsupervised approaches whereas PRED object features showed better results for motion verbs. We also observe that supervised classifiers outperform most frequent sense for motion verbs and for non-motion verbs our scores match with most frequent sense heuristic. 5.3 Error Analysis In order to understand the cases where the proposed unsupervised algorithm failed, we analyzed the im-ages that were disambiguated incorrectly. For the PRED setting, we observed that using predicted im-age descriptions yielded lower scores compared to predicted object labels. The main reason for this is that the image description system often generates ir-relevant descriptions or descriptions not related to the action depicted, whereas the object labels pre-dicted by the CNN model tend to be relevant. This highlights that current image description systems still have clear limitations, despite the high evalu-ation scores reported in the literature (Vinyals et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2015). Examples are shown in Table 6: in all cases human generated descriptions and object labels that are relevant for disambigua-tion, which explains the higher scores in the GOLD setting. We have introduced the new task of visual verb sense disambiguation: given an image and a verb, identify the verb sense depicted in the image. We developed the new VerSe dataset for this task, based on the existing COCO and TUHOI datasets. We proposed an unsupervised visual sense disambiguation model based on the Lesk algorithm and demonstrated that both textual and visual information associated with an image can contribute to sense disambiguation. In an in-depth analysis of various image representa-tions we showed that object labels and visual fea-tures extracted using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks result in good disambiguation per-formance, while automatically generated image de-scriptions are less useful.
