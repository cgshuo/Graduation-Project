 Explanations are important for users to make decisions on whether to take recommendations. However, algorithm gen-erated explanations can be overly simplistic and unconvinc-ing. We believe that humans can overcome these limita-tions. Inspired by how people explain word-of-mouth rec-ommendations, we designed a process, combining crowd-sourcing and computation, that generates personalized nat-ural language explanations. We modeled key topical as-pects of movies, asked crowdworkers to write explanations based on quotes from online movie reviews, and personal-ized the explanations presented to users based on their rat-ing history. We evaluated the explanations by surveying 220 MovieLens users, nding that compared to personalized tag-based explanations, natural language explanations: 1) con-tain a more appropriate amount of information, 2) earn more trust from users, and 3) make users more satis ed. This paper contributes to the research literature by describing a scalable process for generating high quality and personalized natural language explanations, improving on state-of-the-art content-based explanations, and showing the feasibility and advantages of approaches that combine human wisdom with algorithmic processes.
 Crowdsourcing; Recommendation Explanations; Natural Lan-guage Processing; Clustering; Word2Vec
Because recommendation explanations are crucial for good user experiences with recommender systems, they have re-ceived persistent research interest [11,20,22]. Past research has shown several positive effects of recommendation ex-planations, including increasing user trust in recommender systems [18] and helping users make good decisions on rec-ommendations [20].
 Recommendation explanations on popular websites, how-Fi gure 1: Example natural language explanations for the movie \Gravity". Depending on our model of a user's interest, our system selects one of the three explanations for the user. ever, are mostly generated by algorithms, hence are syntac-tic and formulaic. For example, \Customers who bought this item also bought ..." on Amazon and \Based on your watching history." on YouTube.

In comparison, people can provide effective explanations for everyday recommendations. For example, when librari-ans recommend books, they may summarize and highlight a book's content and help people gure out whether it is a good t for them.

Though human effort is generally expensive, crowdsourc-ing enables computational processes to integrate human in-puts at scale and on demand, extending the capability of cur-rent computational systems. For example, Cheng et al. [7] leverage crowd wisdom to train a machine learning system that can detect whether people in a video are lying.
Pure crowdsourcing approaches to generating natural lan-guage recommendation explanations will not succeed be-cause most crowdworkers are not domain experts. For ex-ample, we cannot expect a crowdworker who has not seen \Gravity" to write an effective explanation for a movie fan who likes intense movies. Therefore, to generate natural lan-guage explanations at scale, we combine several techniques. First, we build on existing algorithmic processes that gen-erate personalized content-based explanations [22]. Second, we combine this content model with user review text, which is popular across many recommendation systems, including IMDb and Yelp. To convert these two inputs into a set of coherent explanations that can be selected for display on a per-user basis, we rely on a combination of several crowd-sourcing and algorithmic steps.
In this paper, we present a system that leverages this mixed computation { computation that combines crowdsourced data into an algorithmic processes { to generate personalized natural language recommendations at scale. See Figure 1 for three example explanations generated by our process for the movie \Gravity"; in application, we would select the one explanation for display that best matches with the current user's interests. Our system can be adapted to any recom-mendation application where user reviews and topic labels (e.g., categories, genres, or tags) for items are available.
We deployed the system in MovieLens and conducted a controlled experiment to evaluate the resulting explanations. Using established rubrics from past research [20], we com-pared the natural language explanations with tag-based ex-planations generated by a state-of-the-art algorithm [22]. This paper makes the following contributions:
Explanation interfaces in recommender systems commu-nicate why a user might like (or dislike) a particular item. In this section we describe several key dimensions, the research and industrial work that has explored these dimensions, and where our experimental system ts.

When designing recommendation explanations, there are several \styles" [21] of explanations to choose from: case-based, collaborative-based [11], content-based [22], conver-sational [19], demographic-based, and knowledge-based [24]. For example, Amazon's \Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought ..." is collaborative-based, while Pandora's \Based on what you've told us so far, we're playing this track because it features ..." is content-based.
Apart from styles of explanations, explanations can be presented in different ways, e.g., using natural language, template-based language, or a graphical representation [3, 11]. As template-based language can be generated by algo-rithms, it is most common on popular websites. Tintarev et al. [20] also experimented with lling a template with movie meta data. As for graphical explanations, Herlocker et al. [11], for example, experimented with histograms of rat-ings as explanations, nding them to be persuasive. Natural language explanations, however, can not be easily generated by an algorithm, and have received little research attention.
Recommendation explanations can be personalized or non-personalized, depending on whether or not different users see different explanations for the same item. Personalization has been shown to have positive and negative effects [20], depending on the design. Herlocker et al. [11] found that non-personalized histograms of ratings are more persuasive than personalized histograms of ratings from users' neigh-bors in preference space. Vig et al. [22] also observed a similar effect with tag-based explanations: personalization resulted in a better user experience in one of their designs, but had a negative effect on the other one.

Inspired by word-of-mouth recommendation explanations, we are interested in designing personalized natural language explanations about the content of recommended items. Our intuition is that by showing what users might like about recommended items (in a personalized fashion), we can con-vince them to explore or even consume unfamiliar items [12, 15]. Our goal is to help users to decide whether or not to take a recommendation. Therefore, the text should be reasonably short to avoid overwhelming users as they casually browse recommendations. We hypothesize that users have better experience with natural language, compared with template-based language.

In generating natural language explanations with human effort, we can either recruit professionals like librarians or paid crowdworkers. While professionals may generate higher quality content { though prior work has shown counter-examples [10] { crowdsourcing has the advantages of being scalable, on-demand, and relatively inexpensive.
To reduce the difficulty of writing explanations, we can show crowdworkers relevant text from user reviews, by sim-ple text search or more advanced data mining methods [1,8, 14]. Finding crowdworkers who are familiar with items and capable of writing explanations is challenging. Showing rel-evant information from user reviews can address this issue: crowdworkers who have not watched a movie can still synthe-size and edit already-written sentences. Current data min-ing methods focus on extracting keywords and key phrases from text. For example, Liu et al. [14] introduced an al-gorithm that extracts salient phrases from review data, e.g., \ice cream parlor" from Yelp's review data. These keywords offer limited help for crowdworkers. Therefore, we use sim-ple text search to nd sentences that may be relevant for explanations.

In this paper, we describe a mixed computation approach { combining crowd wisdom with algorithms. Recent research on crowdsourcing shows that such mixed computation cre-ates exciting new applications, such as Soylent, a crowd-powered word editor [2]. More closely related, Organisciak et al. [17] proposed a crowdsourcing system to take on a collaborative ltering task -predicting user ratings. Chang et al. [6] showed that paid crowdworkers can make movie recommendations that are better perceived by users than algorithmic recommendations, and that paid crowdworkers can also produce decent quality explanations for their rec-ommendations.
In this section, we give an overview of the system, showing how we composite three processes to generate personalized natural language explanations.

The system takes topic labels and reviews for items as input, and generates natural language explanations, which are presented to users in a personalized fashion based on their past activities, e.g., ratings, clicks, or purchases. Both topic labels and reviews are easily accessible in contempo-rary recommender systems. Topic labels for items can be either tags provided by users or topic entities (e.g., Google's knowledge graph entities) generated through a computa-tional process [4, 25]. User reviews are a popular feature in e-commerce sites such as Amazon and the Apple App Store, and in specialized sites such as IMDB for movies and Yelp for restaurants.

The system consists of three processes, as shown in Fig-ure 2 and described in more detail in Section 5: 1. Select key topical dimensions from item topic labels. algorithm, while the last one only uses algorithm. 2. Generate natural language explanations for the key top-3. Model users' preferences and present explanations in
We deploy our explanation system in MovieLens, a movie recommendation website with over 3000 monthly active users. Users rate and tag movies and receive recommendations. MovieLens currently does not provide explanations for its recommendations, but this is currently the second most re-quested feature by its users 1 .

We recruit crowdworkers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (\Mturk" for short) for the human computational tasks re-quired in our system. To ensure quality results, we only re-cruited US crowdworkers who have nished more than 2000 HITs (or micro tasks) and maintain higher than 98% ap-proval rate.
We now describe three mixed computational steps that generate explanations of the following form: \From your MovieLens pro le it seems that you prefer movies tagged as [Topical Dimension] , [Natural Language Explanation] ". These steps, in particular, generate two natural language components: \ [Topical Dimension] ", a personalized topic la-bel, and\ [Natural Language Explanation] ", a crowd-synthesized explanation based on review text. For each step, we describe separately the generalizable mixed computation and the ex-perimental implementation details. h ttps://movielens.uservoice.com/suggestions/5585074 Fi gure 3: An example of crowd-re ned tag clusters for the movie \Goodfellas". The algorithm gener-ates four tag clusters. The crowdworkers curated the tags: a strikethrough indicates bad cluster t, a crossout indicates inappropriateness for explana-tions, and red/bold indicates selection as the repre-sentative tag for the cluster.
We aim to nd semantically diverse topical dimensions of an item from associated topic labels to ll the \ [Topical Di-mension] " part of the explanation. Our intuition is that to personalize an explanation for a user, we should highlight an aspect of the recommended item for which the user previ-ously has expressed a preference. For example, some movie fans be drawn to the movie Gravity because of its space travel aspects, while others will be drawn to it for its high quality 3D effects. Therefore, we want to show different ex-planations (shown in Figure 1) to these two groups of users.
Using a clustering algorithm is one way to select diverse topical labels that represent a larger set of topic labels. Clus-tering, based on semantic similarities, groups similar topic labels together. For example, a clustering algorithm may group \3D", \visual" and \CG" together because they are semantically similar.
 We leverage crowd wisdom to re ne topic label clusters. Clustering, as an unsupervised learning method, is sensitive to parameter choices and notoriously difficult to evaluate. In addition, we need to nd one tag to ll in \ [Topical Di-mension] ", a highly subjective task. Human wisdom has been shown to be effective in improving clustering results [5]. Therefore, we decide to ask crowdworkers to re ne algorith-mically generated clusters and pick labels for the clusters. is used in the reduce phase.
In our experimental system, we clustered most relevant tags to movies. We selected top 20 most relevant tags for each movie, using an automatic tagging system for movies -tag genome [23]. Alternatively, we could simply take top 20 most frequently applied tags for systems without tag genome. With manual inspection, we nd that the 20 most relevant tags describe most key attributes of movies.
Then, we clustered, for each movie, the most relevant tags based on semantic similarities computed from movie reviews. To compute semantic similarities between tags, we rst trained Word2Vec, a neural network embedding model [16], on a random sample of IMDB reviews (total size of 300MB); and then computed cosine similarities between latent vectors of tags from the embedding model. In train-ing the word2vec model, we choose the dimension of 1000 for the embedding model, after inspecting outputs from the model with varying dimensions (ranging from 50 to 1500). With semantic similarities between tags, we constructed a similarity graph of the top 20 tags for each movie and ran an affinity propagation clustering algorithm [9] on the graph. After tuning the affinity propagation parameters, we gener-ated between 4 to 6 tag clusters, which seemed appropriate with manual inspection, for each movie.

Lastly, we recruited crowdworkers from Mturk to re ne algorithm generated tag clusters and label clusters. For each movie, we aggregated judgments, using majority vot-ing, from three independent workers, each paid with $0.15. We instructed crowdworkers to 1) remove tags that did not belong with other tags in a cluster, 2) remove tags that were inappropriate (or offensive) to appear in the explana-tion template \From your MovieLens pro le it seems that you prefer movies tagged as " , and 3) pick tags as labels for clusters. The example in Figure 3 shows the result of this step on the movie \GoodFellas".
Having obtained key topical dimensions for each movie in the previous process, we again use mixed computation to generate the \ [Natural Language Explanation] " for each of the topical dimensions. As discussed in Section 2, our expla-nations should be short, descriptive about a certain topical dimension and well written. Given these constraints, only a human can write these explanations. However, writing ex-planations for a movie can be a challenging task for crowd-workers, who may have not watched the movies. Though an algorithm struggles to write explanations, it can extract rel-evant information about a topic dimension of a movie from user reviews, assisting crowdworkers in writing. In addition to algorithm support, we use a two stage MapReduce [13] work ow to ensure the quality of crowd synthesized explanations. Showing algorithm-extracted text from user reviews simpli es the task of writing explanations; however, there is not a good computational method for mea-suring the quality of these explanations. Therefore, we had multiple independent crowdworkers synthesize explanations from selected review text in the Map phase, and then had another group of workers vote on the best explanation.
To assist crowdworkers, we located and presented quotes describing a topical dimension of a movie. First, we found highly voted positive IMDB reviews for each movie. Then, fo r each topical dimension of the movie, we searched 2 the indexed review text for sentences containing any tag in the corresponding tag clusters. Finally, we selected top 6 quotes, considering work load for crowd workers, as ranked by the number of votes and ratings on the reviews. For example, here are quotes for the aspect \ drama , masterpiece, story-telling, dialogue" about the movie \Goodfellas":
In the mapper phase, we recruited three workers to syn-thesize explanations for each movie, paying $0.75 to each worker. As shown in the interface in Figure 4a, we had the following instructions for crowdworkers: 1) pick one quote that best describes a topical dimension (represented as tags) of a movie from 6 quotes shown; 2) rewrite the selected quote into an explanation that follows the template \From your MovieLens pro le it seems that you prefer movies tagged as [Automatically Filled in Topical Dimension] , " , limited to 50 words.

In the reducer phase, we recruited three workers to vote on the best explanations from the mapper phase, paying $0.40 to each worker. As shown in the interface in Figure 4b, we asked crowdworkers to vote on the best explanation for a topical dimension (represented as tags) of a given movie. For example, the resulting explanation for the aspect of\ drama , masterpiece, storytelling, dialogue" about \Goodfellas" is:
Now that we have natural language explanations for mul-tiple topical dimensions of a movie, we present users with explanations that best match with their own topic-based preferences. First, we model a user's preferences on topic labels from her activities in the recommender system, e.g., ratings and clicks. Second, we choose a natural language explanation based on the user's favorite topical dimension (represented as a topic label) for a given movie.

In MovieLens, we modeled users' preferences for tags based on their movie ratings, as shown in the equation below. More formally, the tag preference of user u on tag t , de-noted as pref u;t , was computed from the set of movies M that user u has rated. where m denote a movie in M u , rating u;m denotes the user's rating on movie m and rel m;t denotes relevance score of tag t to movie m given by algorithmic tagging system -tag genome [23]. Note that we have a user average Bayesian Prior avg u , which is user's average preference on tags. With the choice of K = 20, pref u;t is skewed towards the prior when user has few ratings, because few ratings can not ac-curately represent users' preferences on tags.

When recommending a movie to a user, we picked a topi-cal dimension, each represented with a tag, that has highest value of pref u;t and presented the matching natural lan-guage explanation.
We evaluated our natural language explanations, com-pared with a baseline of personalized tag explanation, using a within-subjects user experiment in MovieLens. We pick the tag explanation designed by Vig et al. [22], because it, similar to Pandora's explanations, represents state-of-the-art content-based explanations.

We invited MovieLens users to participate in an online survey via email invitations. From January 29, 2016, we sent emails to 4000 recent active users who have more than 15 total ratings and have logged in after November 1, 2015. 220 users nished our survey (we required users to submit at least one pair of responses for inclusion) and gave 711 responses (we allowed users to continue submitting more responses after their rst).
 We implemented Vig et al.'s tag explanations [22] in Movie-Lens as follows. For a movie recommended to a user, we ranked highly relevant tags { with a relevance score higher than 4 on a 1-5 scale { based on the user's preferences, and then picked the top 5 tags in the ranking to ll in the tem-plate \ We recommend the movie because you like the follow-ing features: [tag1, ..., tag5] " as an explanation.
In the survey, participants evaluated both natural lan-guage explanations and the baseline tag explanations for randomly selected movies from a set of 100 movies with high average ratings and not rated by each participant. This set of 100 movies all had an average rating of at least 3.8 on a 5 star scale; 50 were drawn from the top-500 and 50 were drawn from the 500 to 1000 most frequently rated movies. We generated natural language explanations for the 100 movies with a cost of $3.90 per movie using the previously described system. For each participant, we randomly picked an unrated movie from the set of 100 and showed it together with a baseline or experimental explanation. We asked the participant to nish at least one pair of evaluations { one baseline, one experimental { and gave them the option to evaluate more pairs.
We evaluated explanations according to established rubrics from past research [21]. We selected the four rubrics that are most appropriate for our natural language explanations as de ned below.

We designed a three-stage survey to measure these four qualities of recommendation explanations, asking questions when participants 1) have only seen the title, year, genre and poster of a movie, 2) have also seen the explanation, and 3) have also watched a trailer for the movie (a pre-view/advertisement for the movie, typically 2-3 minutes long). In each stage, we asked participants to respond to several statements on 5-point Likert scale, from \Strongly Disagree" to \Strongly Agree". In Table 1, we summarize the ques-tions from all three stages. Note that we asked participants to respond to two statements repeatedly in all three stages to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of explanations. More speci cally, we measured effectiveness as the change of a participant's response to \I am interested in watching this movie"before and after watching the movie trailer. The change should be small for effective explanations, which help users to accurately gauge their interest in recommendations before consumption [21]. As asking participants to watch a full movie is unrealistic in this experimental context, we ap-proximate this action with watching a trailer. Similarly, we measured efficiency with time spent reading explanations and changes in participants' responses to \I know enough about this movie to decide whether to watch it." before and after seeing explanations.
In this section, we describe ndings on how personalized natural language explanations compare with personalized-tag-explanation baseline in the four rubrics.

We treat raw responses to survey questions as ordinal data and use non-parametric statistical models for analysis. For effectiveness and efficiency where we measure the difference between two responses, we rst map 5-point Likert responses to values 1-5, calculate the difference in values (ranging from Figure 5: Survey responses to questions regarding efficiency . Natural language explanations -labeled with\crowd"-contained a more appropriate amount of information (a) and helped subjects more with decision-making (b). -4 to 4) and treat the result as ordinal data. Using the Cumulative Link Mixed Models 3 , we model the xed ef-fect of the explanation type (baseline vs. experimental) on ordinal responses, with user and movie as random effects. We include the two random effects to capture the variances of responses across users and variances caused by different movies shown in the survey.
As compared with our baseline explanations, participants perceive the natural language explanations to have more in-formation and a more appropriate amount of information; on the other hand, they take longer to read. Participants in 45% of cases agreed with the statement \The explanation contains right amount of information." for natural language explanation, compared to only 19% for tag explanations (CLMM, N = 711, p 0), as shown in Figure 5a. More speci cally, natural language explanations contain more in-formation than tag explanations, as evident by changes of responses on \I know enough about this movie to decide whether to watch it.". We observe greater changes towards positive direction when showing natural language explana-

This is as expected, because natural language explanations are longer and more descriptive than tag explanations. As a result, we observe the increased time participants spent reading natural language explanations as compared with tag explanations: there is a 0.38 difference of log transformed seconds spent on reading.
We observe that natural language explanations are no dif-ferent than tag explanations in terms of effectiveness, which is measured as the changes of responses on \I am inter-ested in watching this movie." when seeing explanations and having watched trailers. As shown in Figure 6, a par-ticipant's interest level, in fact, is slightly more likely to decrease for natural language explanations than for tag ex-planations (28% vs. 26%). This can be attributed to the fact that natural language explanations are more persuasive, hence participants may became overly excited after reading the explanations. Note that in both conditions, 1/3 of the users reported the same interest level after watching trailers; given that trailers are usually rich with information that as-sists in decision-making, this result is encouraging regarding the overall effectiveness of both types of explanations.
We nd that participants trusted personalized natural lan-guage explanations more than the baseline tag explanations as shown in Figure 7. For the statement \I trust the expla-nation.", participants were signi cantly (CLMM, N = 711 , p &lt; 0 : 05) more likely to agree when seeing natural lan-guage explanations than seeing tag explanations (66% vs. 57% agree). We nd more agreement on the statement \The explanation re ects my preferences about this movie." for natural language explanations, but this effect is small and not statistically signi cant.
Participants rated natural language explanations more highly on all three satisfaction questions, shown in Figure 8 (CLMM, N = 711, p &lt; 0 : 001 for all three): 68% of responses agreed that natural language explanations are \useful" compared to 51% for tag explanations. Though natural language expla-nations are longer and contain more information, 76% of the responses agreed that they are \easy to understand" com-pared to 61% of the responses for tag explanations. Overall, 68% of responses wished to include natural language expla-nations in MovieLens compared to 51% for tag explanations. 22 0 participants have options to evaluate more than 1 pair Fi gure 7: Survey responses to questions regarding trust . Participants trusted natural language expla-nations more than tag explanations. Fi gure 8: Survey responses to questions regarding satisfaction . Across the three questions, partici-pants gave more positive responses for natural lan-guage explanations as compared with tag explana-tions.
The user experiment shows that natural language expla-nations generated from our process are better received by users compared to the personalized-tag-explanation base-line, which represents state-of-the-art content-based expla-nation. Compared with the baseline, users perceived that natural language explanations are more trustworthy , con-tain a more appropriate amount of information and offer a better user experience . To our surprise, though, natu-ral language explanations are comparable in effectiveness for helping users make decisions on whether to take rec-ommendations. Considering that users only spend a small amount of effort reading explanations, both content-based explanations are fairly effective in helping users make good decisions. However, apart from the content of items, many other factors may affect users' decision on whether to take recommendations, such as their trust in the system, social in uence and past experience [12]. This is perhaps the rea-son why users perceive that natural language explanations contain richer information but are not signi cantly more ef-fective in decision-making support.

Though natural language explanations written by humans are superior to automatically generated explanations, hu-man labor is expensive and difficult to scale up. Our system addresses this challenge through a mixed computation model that combines intelligent algorithms with crowdsourced in-puts. Crowdsourcing allows our system to quickly recruit large number of workers as needed. Our algorithmic pro-cesses model the content of items and extract quotes from existing user reviews, two steps that effectively reduce the h uman effort required per movie. In our experiment we gen-erated natural language explanation for 100 movies at the cost of $3.90 per movie in a short amount of time. For orga-nizations that can afford this per-item cost, we believe our approach could be scaled to a much larger item space.
Our explanation process underscores the potential of mixed computation approaches that combine algorithms with crowd wisdom. Recent research in machine learning, especially deep neural networks, has advanced the limit of computers in image/voice recognition tasks and natural language con-versations { advances that are made possible with human-generated training data. For tasks that remain too chal-lenging for a purely algorithm solution (e.g., writing recom-mendation explanations) crowdsourcing may be a scalable solution. In the long run, crowd-generated data can be fed into machine learning processes to enable the automation of human work, pushing the limit of algorithms. This paper makes the following contributions:
