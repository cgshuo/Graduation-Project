 Traditional information retrieval models assume that users express their information needs via text queries ( i.e. , their  X  X alk X ). In this poster, we consider Web browsing behavior outside of intera c-tions with retrieval systems ( i.e. , users X   X  X alk X ) as an alternative source of signal describing users X  in formation needs, and compare it to the query -expressed information needs on a large dataset. Our findings demonstrate that information needs expressed in different behavior modalities are largely non -overlapping, and that past b e-havior in each modality is the most accurate predictor of future behavior in that modality. Results also show that browsing data provides a stronger source of signal than search queries due to its greater volume, which explains previous work that has found i m-plicit behavioral data t o be a valuable source of information for user modeling and personalization.
 Modeling user interests is a central problem for personalization and information filtering applicat ions that attempt to meet distinct needs of individual users, which include recommender systems, and personalized search and advertising. Such applications typ i-cally rely on processing past user behavior to obtain a refined r e-presentation of user interests suitable for predicting future beh a-vior. Most often, past user behavior is assumed to be of the same modality (type) as future behavior, e.g. , consumption data and ratings of domain -specific items such as movies for recommen d-ers [7], or past search -relate d behavior for personalized search [3]. It is well understood in the Information Retrieval (IR) community that interaction with search systems does not completely capture all aspects of users X  underlying information needs [5]. Relevance feedback (RF) [4] has been proposed as a methodology for i m-proving retrieval performance by capturing users X  implicit or e x-plicit relevance judgments through interactions that follow a query. Although RF is typically applied within the local context of a single search sessi on, persistent user profiles gathered from i m-plicit data have shown promise in a number of information access environments [2]. Behavior other t han interactions with retrieval systems has been previously employed for improving personalized search [6], i n-cluding desktop and Web browsing data. Prior study of the rel a-tive value of different behavior modalities was limited to evalua t-ing their utility for personalizing search. In this work, we consi d-er the general problem of predicting users X  future interests based on multiple modalities. We specifically focus on users X  querying behavior and their browsing behavior, and evaluate their relative informat iveness for predicting users X  future information needs. User interest profiles can be constructed based on a history of their querying, browsing, or a combination of the two. This poster presents a study of the relative predictiveness of user profiles crea ted using these two modes of information need expression, with the aim of determining whether querying, browsing, or their combination produce more accurate user profiles. We evaluate the performance of profiles derived from these sources based on how well they predict future behavior of a large sample of Web users. A key issue in comparing the information content across multiple behavior sources is establishing a single representation of info r-mation need that is equally capable of capturing signal from each source. In this work, we employ a representation based on adve r-tising keywords , which are short phrases ( X  X eywords X ) bid on by a large number of advertisers on Microsoft AdCenter, a large ad ve r-tising platform. The resulting representation is very rich: it is based on several million keywords, and yields either an exact or a subsequence match for the majority of queries submitted to major search engines. This representation is arguably more se mantically meaningful than simple token -based vocabularies and more nat u-ralistic than automatically or manually constructed query categ o-rization hierarchies. Unlike query behavior, browsing behavior must be mapped to a key word -based representation indirectly. To do this, we use search engine click logs. When a user issues a query to a search engine, and then clicks on a result, they are implicitly associating their query with that page. Through logs of search queries and su bsequent result clicks, individual pages and domains (websites) can be represented by sets of keywords. Such a representation has been previously considered in an IR context from a formal graph -theoretic perspective [1]. In this work, we build keyword -base d user profiles from browsing behavior by including the top -frequency keywords for each domain the user visited ( i.e. , the most frequent searches leading to the domain). Since the core task for any user modeling system is predicting f u-ture behavior, we evaluate the informativeness of different sources of behavioral signal based on their predictive value. In other words, we aggregate the past behavior in the two modalities considered (search queries and browsing behavio r) over a given time period, and evaluate the predictiveness of the resulting a g-gregated user profile with respect to behavior occurring in a su b-sequent period. We use standard IR measures, precision and r e-call, to evaluate the profiles. Precision is the fraction of all pr e-dicted keywords that are observed in the future data, and recall is the fraction of all future keywords predicted by the past -based profiles. We report values micro -averaged by user.
 We conduct our study on a dataset that includes Web q uerying and browsing behavior of over 1.2 million consenting users in November 2007 obtained via a browser toolbar plugin. A co m-plete behavior log of every user is split into  X  X ast X  and  X  X uture X  halves on November 15. Separate profiles are then created for both past and future by mapping the querying and browsing beh a-vior to advertising keywords as described in Section 2. On ave r-age, each query -based user profile contains 21.2 keywords, while each browsing -based profile contains 137.4 keywords (based on 15 days of behavioral data). First, we compare the average precision and recall for profiles based on the two different modalities (queries and browsing) as well as their combination for the task of predicting future behavior either i n the same or different modality. Table 1 below presents these results. Given the large sample sizes, all observed differen c-es in the means were statistically significant ( p  X  0 .0 00 1 with two -tailed t -tests based on 10 -fold subsamples ) . Note that the rela tiv e-ly low precision and recall values are explained by the fact that the metrics only account for exact matches: for example, if a ke y-word canon was predicted for a user, and the query [ best canon digital slr ] was observed in future behavior which maps to ke y-words canon , slr , canon slr, digital slr , and canon digital slr , a recall of 0.25 would be recorded. If the example was reversed temporally, precision would suffer correspondingly.
 Table 1 . Prediction precision/recall for diffe rent modalities. The results in Table 1 demonstrate that information intents e x-pressed in users X  querying and browsing behavior are largely i n-dependent: the highest precision is obtained for any modality based on previous behavior in the same modality, while predi c-tions based on a different moda lity are significantly less accurate. At the same time, results show that the signal contained in brow s-ing behavior is more salient across modalities than that contained in querying behavior: recall of future querying behavior is higher when based on past browsing than on past querying. Combining the two behavior modalities leads to modest recall improvements over using either modality in isolation; recall for predicting either querying or browsing behavior based on their combination is slightly higher than that based on either behavior in isolation. This demonstrates that the information intents expressed through those different behaviors are primarily orthogonal.
 Our results raise the question of whether browsing behavior may appear more salient only beca use it is more plentiful, and hence leads to the creation of larger profiles. We conducted further e x-periments where every user profile constructed based on past data was constrained to a fixed number of keywords, with keywords selected via ranking based o n combining frequency and recency of keyword occurrences. Figure 1 illustrates recall obtained from these experiments.
 These results demonstrate that a larger volume of brow sing data is required for predicting future querying behavior more effectively than prediction based on querying behavior alone (as evidenced by the B  X  X  curve being dominated by the Q X  X  curve up to 120 keywords; the curves eventually cross due to smaller v olumes of querying data). At the same time, access to both behavior modal i-ties provides sustained improvements for all profile sizes, again demonstrating that information needs expressed in different mo d-alities are largely independent for all amounts of a vailable data. Finally, we note that the B+Q  X  X  curve is dominated by the Q  X  X  curve for smaller profiles because of the simplistic profile construction procedure we used. Machine learning methods would allow combining the two data sources for more accura te profiles than those obtained from each source alone. We have described a large -scale study that demonstrates that b e-havior modalities differ significantly in their ability to predict u s-ers X  future information needs. Furthermore, the study re veals that information intents expressed through different modalities are largely orthogonal. In particular, users X  querying behavior (their  X  X alk X ) is a more limited source of predictive signal than their browsing behavior (their  X  X alk X ). These findings h ave profound implications for user modeling and personalization applications, encouraging focus on approaches that can leverage users X  brow s-ing behavior as a source of information.
