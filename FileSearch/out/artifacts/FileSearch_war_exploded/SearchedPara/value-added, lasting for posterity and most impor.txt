 value-added, lasting for posterity and most importantly, acts as a supporting resource that facilitates avoiding serious disasters/mistakes in future Project Management. For content, context and strategies in systems par-adigm, all that is mentioned above, this book is not the source of information. Instead, for a book that high-lights importance of documentation in PM, one has to look elsewhere (Rakos et al., 2004).

The book, under review, has many recent citations, with an almost 99% bias toward British/European sources. But conspicuously absent are the following titles: (a) Project Management for Library and Informa-tion Service Professionals (Aslib Know How Guides) by Kirsten Black, Sylvia P. Webb (Editor), Europa Pub-lications (1996); (b) Guide to Information in Engineering Project Management: An Information and Library
Service Guide, Professional Engineering Publishing (1996); (c) Disaster management in British libraries: Pro-ject report with guidelines for library managers (Library and information research report) by Graham Mat-thews (British Library, 1996); and (d) The Hospital Information Project: A research project undertaken by
Kingston upon Hull City Libraries on behalf of Hull (A) Group Hospital Management ... ice from the College of Librarianship, Wales, by Graham L. Matthews (Hull (A) Group Hospital Management Committee; Kings-ton upon Hull City Libraries 1973).

Nevertheless, it is an excellent book that incorporates a number of examples and case studies. It religiously outlines the steps involved in PM, from planning to execution. The frame of reference, conceptual approach and strategy are valuable for LIS profession. It is a handy and easy to read textbook. Project Management is reader friendly too, because it comes from the pen of an experienced scholar, instructor as well practitioner. Prof. Barbara X  X  work is highly valuable for the programs offered in UK and elsewhere on PM.

Several university libraries during the early 1990s, in efforts to reduce costs, increase efficiency and produc-tivity, boost job satisfaction, empower and develop staff, and ultimately improve services, began a process of work reorganization. Noting the success of the team concept in the business world, some libraries adopted the selective use of teams in one or two work units while others moved towards a totally team based organization.
Working in teams is currently a widespread management technique and varying types of work teams in today X  X  libraries include multi-functional teams, project teams and cross functional teams. Another type of work team is the self-directed team. Also known as self-managed work teams, self-maintaining teams, self-leading teams, and self-regulating work teams, self-directed teams in the main, consist of a group of functionally flexible employees who are responsible for directing and controlling their own work; instead of a formal leader, a nominated team leader co-ordinates the team X  X  activities and acts as a central point of com-munication. However, in practice the sense of the term  X  X  X elf-directed team X  X  can vary broadly between organizations.

Teams in Library Technical Services co-edited by Bazirjian and Mugridge, two university librarians, is a compilation of 12 essays dealing with self-directed teams and their functions in academic library technical services. The book which comprises 12 chapters is organized into four parts, each of which deals with a work team related issue. The title of the book suggests a specific audience (e.g. library managers/librarians in technical services), but according to the editors, the book is suitable reading for any manager or librarian who has an interest in the application of team theory and the assessment of team organizational structures.
With contributions from various university librarians and library administrators, the main topics of the book involve: team theory, team structure effectiveness, re-evaluation of the team structure and special purpose teams. The range of team related issues covered include relationships between professional and support staff; performance evaluation, rewards and recognition, hiring, workload and workflow.

Part One introduces the topic of team management. Comprising three chapters, Part One focuses on the theory and history of teams in organizational culture. Chapter one draws a clear connection between organi-zational culture and team implementation and suggests ways on how to successfully integrate both elements within one X  X  culture. The next chapter looks at team management structures by analyzing and comparing the team concept as implemented in the technical services units of five university libraries. It concludes by tracing the evolution of the team management approach at one of the five university libraries. The last chapter in this section is based on an updated library case study from the University of Arizona. It explores the shifts in work responsibilities brought about by team based approaches and the subsequent changes to the team structure and in the duties of library support staff.

Part Two addresses the effectiveness of the team structure. This is the longest section of the book with four chapters devoted to the topic. The opening chapter presents a case study on program review. It gives an account of the steps taken by the University of Maryland Libraries X  technical services department to effect the change over from a traditional hierarchical structure to a flatter team based structure. The study concludes with an overview of lessons learned during the process. The following chapter identifies the key factors asso-ciated in the continuing success and durability of a decade long semiautonomous technical services work team at MIT libraries. Based on the planning experiences of the University of Arizona X  X  Library technical and archival services team, the next chapter treats with strategic planning and organizational structure in a team environment. The concluding chapter in Part Two is devoted to another case study from the Appalachian X  X 
State University Libraries technical services unit. The study which revisits the concept of team training ten years after the establishment of a team environment, submits various lessons that were learnt and useful in-sights from staff.

Part Three which focuses on the re-assessment of the team structure, comprises three chapters. The first chapter assesses why two of the three self-directed teams in Penn State X  X  Libraries Serials Division did not achieve a high level of success. A similar theme is continued throughout the next two chapters. Here, it is dis-cussed why two university libraries who after nearly a decade of team implementation, decided to revert to a more traditional or hierarchical structure in their technical services units.

Part Four, the final section in the book, examines specific types of teams. The first of the two chapters, describes the implementation of a short-term improvement team at Penn State University Libraries that was formed to resolve certain identified problems concerning the processing of media/tech materials. The last chap-ter considers matrix management issues. It analyzes the benefits and drawbacks of matrix teams in the academic library setting and also provides four examples of the matrix structure at work at four university libraries.
This compilation of research based writings from more than 12 librarians and library administrators pro-vides valuable insights into and on the use of teams in academic library technical services. The end result is a balanced view on the use of teams through the differing perspectives and experiences. Two important points are underscored: firstly, it takes substantial time and effort to refine the team concept for it to work well and secondly, there must be ongoing evaluation of teams and their structures.
 The general strength of the book is increased through the use of abstracts, case studies and research.
However, the book has one apparent weakness: it lacks an index. Even though one is able to find relevant information through the well organized sections and chapters, the lack of an index prevents the fullest use of this informative collection of essays.

Although, the case studies and research in this book derive from the experiences of large academic libraries, the given perspectives highlight the efforts being made to find solutions and deal with complicated challenges in library technical services X  departments through the use of teams. Teams in Library Technical Services provides helpful advice for library administrators and managers who are either considering the move towards teams or a review of their teams X  effectiveness. The information on teams, team philosophy and team imple-mentation also make the book a handy resource for all types of libraries.

Researchers in different fields (psychology, human resource management) are now investigating genera-tional diversity in the workplace. As many have observed, this is the first time in recent history, that four dis-tinct generations  X  Veterans (1922 X 1945); Boomers (1946 X 1964); Gen X (1965 X 1978); and Gen Y (1979 X 2000) also called Millennials or Net Gen are active in the workforce. Those investigating generational differences seek to better understand how generational diversity affects work dynamics. Different generations may share traditional work values, but different generations have very different lifestyles and attitudes and expectations towards their careers, managers and co-workers.

The Nextgen Librarian X  X  Survival Guide by Rachel Singer Gordon addresses some generational issues affect-ing a particular group  X  nextgens  X  in a particular work environment  X  the library workplace. The author is herself a successful nextgen librarian. Her list of achievements include  X  X  The Accidental Library Manager; The Librarian X  X  Guide to Writing for Publication; and The Accidental Systems Librarian; she is also the creator of
LISjobs.com as well as the founding editor of, and frequent contributor to Info Career Trends, an electronic newsletter.

Gordon sets out to provide a practical guide for new and prospective librarians on how to survive the early years of their career. Although the survival guide is broadly aimed at all new library graduates, it specifically targets the perceived needs of those next generation librarians in their 20s and 30s. According to the author, this demographic group is more likely to share age-related attitudes and experiences that are not essentially common to all new librarians some for whom librarianship is a second or third profession.

The survival guide comprises 10 chapters (and two appendices). It is written in an easy to read style with advice offered in a clear and direct manner. The first chapter deals briefly with several issues and opportunities that for the author place next generation librarians in a unique situation. The chapter continues into a discus-sion on the definition of next generation librarianship. Here, the author acknowledges the risk of making
