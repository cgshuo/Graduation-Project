 In this paper, we propose a method for helping users ex-plore information via Web searches by using a question and answer (Q&amp;A) corpus archived in a community Q&amp;A site. When users do not have clear information needs and have little knowledge about the task domain, it is difficult for them to create queries that adequately reflect their infor-mation needs. We focused on t erms like  X  X amous temples, X   X  X istorical townscapes, X  and  X  X elicious sweets, X  which we call adjective facets , and developed a method of extracting these facets from question and answer archives at a community Q&amp;A site. We evaluated the effectiveness of our adjective facets by comparing them with several baselines.

Recent advancements in Web search engines have enabled users to quickly obtain the information they require by is-suing a single appropriate query. For example, when users want to know tomorrow X  X  weather in Kyoto, they issue the query X  X yoto weather X  to a search engine and visit the highest-ranked search results to obtain the information they require.
With some search tasks, however, users need to generate multiple queries from different aspects and perform searches iteratively. For example, if users who have never been to Kyoto want to make travel plans to visit there, they need to gather information about various aspects of Kyoto. Users Then, their friends might answer,  X  X  recommend visiting the Golden Pavilion and Nijo Castle. X  If we can adapt such human-human interactions to Web searches, those search-ing the Web can interactively explore information according to their interests and find more information than they can with conventional search systems.

In this work, we focus on community question and answer (Q&amp;A) sites, where people post questions and answers to support users X  exploratory We b searches. The Q&amp;A corpora that are archived in Q&amp;A sites are caches of human-human dialogues. The key idea of our research is to use Q&amp;A cor-pora to enhance Web searches, especially exploratory Web searches (Figure 1). If we can extract questioners X  inter-ests (like  X  X amous temples X ), such knowledge can easily be applied to Web searches.
 We focused on terms like famous temples or delicious Japanese-sweets ,whichwecallthe adjective facets of a given query, and developed a method of extracting adjective facets from questions in a Q&amp;A corpus. The method first takes into consideration relationships between questions that con-tain the adjective facets and answers that contain entities (like  X  X olden Pavilion X ) and then constructs a facet-entity bipartite graph, which represents the question-answer co-occurrence of adjective facets and entities. The method then applies the HITS algorithm to the bipartite graph to rank possible adjective facets. We evaluated the effectiveness of our adjective facets by comparing them with several base-lines. The popularity of community Q&amp;A sites such as Yahoo! Answers and Baidu Zhidao, where people directly use nat-ural language to post questions and answers, has recently been rapidly increasing. We will first describe and define the adjective facets used in our work. We will then present the core algorithms used in our method.
From our preliminary experiment, we found that people on a Q&amp;A site are more likely to use  X  X djectives X  than those on the Web. We focused on adjectives and extracted user X  X  adjective-based interests from a Q&amp;A corpus and used them to support exploratory Web sea rches. However, suggesting adjectives on their own, such as  X  X amous X  or  X  X heap, X  to Web searchers are not so useful since their meaning are quite am-biguous. In contrast, adjective-noun combinations like  X  X a-mous temples X  or  X  X heap hotels X  are both more meaningful and more interesting for users. Thus, we define an adjective facet as a nominal phrase that matches the lexical syntactic is to extract good adjective facets that attract users X  inter-ests from a Q&amp;A corpus in order to supporting exploratory Web searches, like Figure 1. Our adjective facets have two characteristics in terms of supporting Web searches.
One is unexpectedness of terms. One important aspect of suggesting terms is to help users think up new approaches to searches. If all the terms that are suggested to users are easily generated for them, this does not effectively help them to explore information from various aspects. It is common for people to issue only nouns as queries when using Web search engines. Therefore, adjective facets, simply because they contain adjectives, are difficult for users to generate as queries and, thus, unexpected to users.
 We first construct a facet-entity bipartite graph G =( F  X  E, E ), where F and E denote the node set and E represents the edge set between facets F and entities E .Ifadjective facet f i  X  F and entity e j  X  E co-occur in the same question-answer pair, there is an edge between f i and e j .
After constructing the graph, we calculate a weight for each edge ( f i ,e i )  X  X  .Let c ( f i ,e j ) be a weight of edge ( f ,e j ). We define c ( f i ,e j ) as the number of question-answer pairs in C that contain f i in their question part and e j in theiranswerpart.

Let w fe ij be the transition probability from adjective facet f larly, the transition probability w ef ji from entity e j to adjec-
To apply the HITS algorithm to the facet-entity bipartite graph G , we used the Co-HITS [3] framework proposed by Deng et al. Co-HITS is a general algorithm to stochastically calculate the importance of the nodes in a bipartite graph, and it contains HITS as a special case.

Let the score of adjective facet f i be x i and the score of entity e j be y j . x i and y j can be calculated by iterating the following two formulae:
We can obtain important adjective facets on the basis of score x i by solving Equation (1).
Calculating Equation (1) enables us to obtain important adjective facets. However, if we simply apply Equation (1) to the bipartite graph, some irrelevant adjective facets (like  X  X ood advice X ) also obtain high scores. These irrelevant ad-jective facets frequently appear in questions but are not re-lated to query q . Therefore, we incorporate the bipartite graph G with the association between query q and adjective facets F to remove irrelevant adjective facets.

By using the Co-HITS algorithm, we can consider the ini-tial importance of each node in the bipartite graph. If x 0 i is an initial importance of adjective facet f i , Equation (1) can be modified to where  X  f  X  [0 , 1] are the parameter that balances the initial scores x 0 i .If  X  f is set to 1, this equation is equal to Equation (1).

To calculate the association between adjective facet f i and query q ,wecalculatethetermco-occurrencewithinaQ&amp;A corpus. We used expected pointwise mutual information [1]. For given query q and adjective facet f i ,expectedpointwise mutual information epmi( q ,f i ) is defined as Table 2: Average scores (AVG) and MAP@ k for the four methods (highest values in bold).
 We asked six volunteers to participate in the experiment. We divided the 60 queries into two groups and each partic-ipant evaluated 30 queries (10 categories  X  3queries.) The order of the queries showed to each volunteers were balanced. The experiment proceeded as follows.
Table 2 shows the results for average score (AVG) and mean average precision at cutoff k =5 , 10 and 15 (MAP@ k ) of the four methods. Terms that scored 4 and 5 were deemed relevant and terms that scored 1, 2, and 3 were deemed irrel-evant to measure mean average precision. From the results in Table 2, we can see that our proposed method QA h + q outperformed WEB and QA hits in terms of all measures. We also found that the average scores of QS and QA h + q were the almost same. simply considering the relationships between adjective facets and co-occurring entities. This re-sults indicate that adjective facets extracted from Q&amp;A cor-pus can attract users X  interests and that a Q&amp;A corpus can be a valuable resource to support exploratory Web searches.
We further analyzed the experimental results in terms of the categories used in the experiment. Table 3 shows the average scores of the four methods for each category. We can see that the effectiveness of our method depended on the category. For example, QA h + q got over 3.00 average score in the  X  X ports X ,  X  X ravel X , and  X  X ome &amp; Food X  cate-gories. On the other hand, it got much lower average score in the  X  X cience &amp; Academic X  and  X  X olitics &amp; News X  categories. From this result, we can estimate that the importance of adjectives depend on the types of knowledge that users are required. When users are searching for information related to a topic that requires highly technical or specialized knowl-edge of them, objective opinions or technical terms might be more important to inform their information needs of a Web search engine than adjectives. With such topics, like poli-tics or science, adjective facets might not preferred by users since those topics require advanced knowledge of users. On the other hand, in the topics related to the  X  X ports X  and  X  X ravel X ,  X  X ome &amp; Food X  categories, subjective opinions or viewpoints might be important to find information, thus, adjective facets were prefe rred by the participants. Table 4 shows example adjective facets that our method QA h + q suggested to the participants. Since these terms
