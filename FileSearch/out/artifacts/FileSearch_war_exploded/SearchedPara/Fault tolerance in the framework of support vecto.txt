In this section, the SVM for regression ( Vapnik, 1995 )is introduced. Suppose we have a training data set f X  x e -SV regression: f  X  x  X  X  / w , x S  X  b with w A X , b A R  X  9  X  product is defined as / u , v S :  X  P N i  X  1  X  u i  X  v i [ u ] function can be seen as a convex optimization problem: minimize 1 2 J w J 2  X  C subject to function shown in L  X  1 2 J w J 2  X  C It follows from the saddle point condition that the partial have to vanish for optimality: @ L @ b  X  @ L @ w  X  w @ L @ x dual problem maximize subject to function is obtained as Eq.

Nonlinear case
Nonlinear function matching problems can be transformed to linear matching problems in a higher dimension space through obtained in the transformed space using methods described in the transformed space.

This allows to rewrite support vector algorithm as follows: maximize subject to

The more common way in which an SVM is trained is by time a sample is added to the training set a new SVM must be trained.

The optimization problem in Eq. (20) must hold the Karush X  satisfy the KKT conditions at each step. 4. Fault tolerance strategy

This strategy has two main drawbacks. The first is that the model cannot be accurate enough. The first problem can be avoided by training the on-line model from the moment the the nominal model to the on-line trained one.

 The training set of the on-line trained SVM is described by taken from the plant: E  X  k  X  X f x  X  k  X  , x  X  k 1  X  , ... , x  X  k N  X g where x  X  k  X  X f e 1  X  k  X  , ... , e n  X  k  X g X  26  X  One disadvantage of training in the proposed way is that the according to the operation point.
