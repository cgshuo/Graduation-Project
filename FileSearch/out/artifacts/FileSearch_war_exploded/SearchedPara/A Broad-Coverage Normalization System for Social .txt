 The amount of user generated content has increased drastically in the past few years, driven by the pros-perous development of the social media websites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. As of June 2011, Twitter has attracted over 300 million users and produces more than 2 billion tweets per week (Twitter, 2011). In a broader sense, Twitter mes-sages, SMS messages, Facebook updates, chat logs, Emails, etc. can all be considered as  X  X ocial text X , which is significantly different from the traditional news text due to the informal writing style and the conversational nature. The social text serves as a very valuable information source for many NLP ap-plications, such as the information extraction (Ritter et al., 2011), retrieval (Subramaniam et al., 2009), summarization (Liu et al., 2011a), sentiment analy-sis (Celikyilmaz et al., 2010), etc. Yet existing sys-tems often perform poorly in this domain due the to extensive use of the nonstandard tokens, emoti-cons, incomplete and ungrammatical sentences, etc. It is reported that the Stanford named entity recog-nizer (NER) experienced a performance drop from 90.8% to 45.8% on tweets (Liu et al., 2011c); the part-of-speech (POS) tagger and dependency parser degraded 12.2% and 20.65% respectively on tweets (Foster et al., 2011). It is therefore of great impor-tance to normalize the social text before applying the standard NLP techniques. Text normalization is also crucial for building robust text-to-speech (TTS) sys-tems, which need to determine the pronunciations for nonstandard words in the social text.

The goal of this work is to automatically con-vert the noisy nonstandard tokens observed in the social text into standard English words. We aim for a robust text normalization system with  X  X road coverage X , i.e., for any user-created nonstandard to-ken, the system should be able to restore the correct word within its top n candidates ( n = 1 , 3 , 10 ... ). This is a very challenging task due to two facts: first, there exists huge amount and a wide variety of nonstandard tokens. (Liu et al., 2011b) found more than 4 million distinct out-of-vocabulary to-kens in the Edinburgh Twitter corpus (Petrovic et al., 2010); second, the nonstandard tokens consist of a mixture of both unintentional misspellings and intentionally-created tokens for various reasons 1 , in-cluding the needs for speed, ease of typing (Crystal, 2009), sentiment expressing (e.g.,  X  X oooool X  (Brody and Diakopoulos, 2011)), intimacy and social pur-pose (Thurlow, 2003), etc., making it even harder to decipher the social messages. Table 1 shows some example nonstandard tokens.

Existing spell checkers and normalization sys-tems rely heavily on lexical/phonetic similarity to select the correct candidate words. This may not work well since a good portion of the correct words lie outside the specified similarity threshold (e.g., (tomorrow,  X  X mrw X ) 2 ), yet the number of candidates increases dramatically as the system strives to in-crease the coverage by enlarging the threshold. (Han and Baldwin, 2011) reported an average of 127 can-didates per nonstandard token with the correct-word coverage of 84%. The low coverage score also en-forces an undesirable performance ceiling for the candidate reranking approaches. Different from pre-vious work, we tackle the text normalization prob-lem from a cognitive-sensitive perspective and in-vestigate the human rationales for normalizing the nonstandard tokens. We argue that there exists a set of letter transformation patterns that humans use to decipher the nonstandard tokens. Moreover, the  X  X i-sual priming X  effect may play an important role in human comprehension of the noisy tokens.  X  X rim-ing X  represents an implicit memory effect. For ex-ample, if a person reads a list of words including the word table , and is later asked to complete a word starting with tab-, it is very likely that he answers table since the person is primed .

In this paper, we propose a broad-coverage nor-malization system by integrating three human per-spectives, including the enhanced letter transforma-tion, visual priming, and the string and phonetic similarity. For an arbitrary nonstandard token, the three subnormalizers each suggest their most con-fident candidates from a different perspective. The candidates can then be heuristically combined or reranked using a message-level decoding process. We evaluate the system on both word-and message-level using four SMS and Twitter data sets. Results show that our system can achieve over 90% word-coverage with limited number of candidates and the broad word-coverage can be successfully translated into message-level performance gain. In addition, our system requires no human annotations, therefore can be easily adapted to different domains. Text normalization, in its traditional sense, is the first step of a speech synthesis system, where the numbers, dates, acronyms, etc. found in the real-world text were converted into standard dictionary words, so that the system can pronounce them cor-rectly. Spell checking plays an important role in this process. (Church and Gale, 1991; Mays et al., 1991; Brill and Moore, 2000) proposed to use the noisy channel framework to generate a list of corrections for any misspelled word, ranked by the correspond-ing posterior probabilities. (Sproat et al., 2001) en-hanced this framework by calculating the likelihood probability as the chance of a noisy token and its as-sociated tag being generated by a specific word.
With the rapid growth of SMS and social me-dia content, text normalization system has drawn in-creasing attention in the recent decade, where the focus is on converting the noisy nonstandard tokens in the informal text into standard dictionary words. (Choudhury et al., 2007) modeled each standard En-glish word as a hidden Markov model (HMM) and calculated the probability of observing the noisy-token under each of the HMM models; (Cook and Stevenson, 2009) calculated the sum of the probabil-ities of a noisy token being generated by a specific word and a word formation process; (Beaufort et al., 2010) employed the weighted finite-state machines (FSMs) and rewriting rules for normalizing French SMS; (Pennell and Liu, 2010) focused on tweets cre-ated by handsets and developed a CRF tagger for deletion-based abbreviation. The text normalization problem was also tackled under the machine transla-tion (MT) or speech recognition (ASR) framework. (Aw et al., 2006) adapted a phrase-based MT model for normalizing SMS and achieved satisfying per-formance. (Kobus et al., 2008) showed that using a statistical MT system in combination with an anal-ogy of the ASR system improved performance in French SMS normalization. (Pennell and Liu, 2011) proposed a two-phase character-level MT system for expanding the abbreviations into standard text. Recent work also focuses on normalizing the Twitter messages, which is generally considered a more challenging task. (Han and Baldwin, 2011) de-veloped classifiers for detecting the ill-formed words and generated corrections based on the morpho-phonemic similarity. (Liu et al., 2011b) proposed to normalize the nonstandard tokens without explic-itly categorizing them. (Xue et al., 2011) adopted the noisy-channel framework and incorporated or-thographic, phonetic, contextual, and acronym ex-pansion factors in calculating the likelihood proba-bilities. (Gouws et al., 2011) revealed that different populations exhibit different shortening styles.
Most of the above systems limit their processing scope to certain categories (e.g., deletion-based ab-breviations, misspellings) or require large-scale hu-man annotated corpus for training, which greatly hinders the scalability of the system. In this paper, we propose a novel cognitively-driven text normal-ization system that robustly tackle both the unin-tentional misspellings and the intentionally-created noisy tokens. We propose a global context-based approach to purify the automatically collected train-ing data and learn the letter transformation pat-terns without human supervision. We also propose a cognitively-grounded  X  X isual priming X  approach that leverages the  X  X riming X  effect to suggest the candidate words. By integrating different perspec-tives, our system can successfully mimic the hu-man rationales and yield broad word-coverage on both SMS and Twitter messages. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate these human perspectives in the text normalization system. In this section, we describe our broad-coverage nor-malization system, which consists of four key com-ponents. For a standard/nonstandard token, three subnormalizers each suggest their most confident candidates from a different perspective 3 :  X  X nhanced Letter Transformation X  automatically learns a set of letter transformation patterns and is most effec-tive in normalizing the intentionally created non-standard tokens through letter insertion, repetition, deletion, and substitution (Section 3.1);  X  X isual Priming X  proposes candidates based on the visual cues and a primed perspective (Section 3.2);  X  X pell Checker X  corrects the misspellings (Section 3.3). The fourth component,  X  X andidate Combination X  introduces various strategies to combine the candi-dates with or without the local context (Section 3.4). Note that it is crucial to integrate different human perspectives so that the system is flexible in pro-cessing both unintentional misspellings and various intentionally-created noisy tokens. 3.1 Enhanced Letter Transformation Given a noisy token t i seen in the text, the letter transformation subnormalizer produces a list of cor-rection candidates s i under the noisy channel model:  X  s = arg max s where we assume each nonstandard token t i is de-pendent on only one English word s i , that is, we are not considering acronyms (e.g.,  X  X bl X  for  X  X e back later X ) in this study. p ( s i ) can be calculated as the unigram count from a background corpus. We formulate the process of generating a nonstandard token t i from the dictionary word s i using a letter transformation model, and use the model confidence as the probability p ( t i | s i ) . Figure 1 shows several example (word, token) pairs.

To form a nonstandard token, each letter in the dictionary word can be labeled with: (a) one of the 0-9 digits; (b) one of the 26 characters including it-self; (c) the null character  X - X ; (d) a letter combi-nation 4 . This transformation process from dictio-nary words to nonstandard tokens will be learned by a character-level sequence labeling system us-ing the automatically collected (word, token) pairs. Next, we create a large lookup table by applying the character-level labeling system to the standard dic-tionary words and generate multiple variations for each word using the n-best labeling output, the la-beling confidence is used as p ( t i | s i ) . During testing, we search this lookup table to find the best candidate words for the nonstandard tokens. For tokens with letter repetition, we first generate a set of variants by varying the repetitive letters (e.g. C i = {  X  X leas X ,  X  X leeas X ,  X  X leaas X ,  X  X leeaas X ,  X  X leeeaas X  } for t i = {  X  X leeeaas X  } ), then select the maximum posterior probability among all the variants:
Different from the work in (Liu et al., 2011b), we enhanced the letter transformation process with two novel aspects: first, we devise a set of phoneme-, syllable-, morpheme-and word-boundary based fea-tures that effectively characterize the formation pro-cess of the nonstandard tokens; second, we propose a global context-aware approach to purify the auto-matically collected training (word, token) pairs, re-sulting system yielded similar performance but with only one ninth of the original data. We name this subnormalizer  X  X nhanced Letter Transformation X . 3.1.1 Context-Aware Training Pair Selection
Manual annotation of the noisy nonstandard to-kens takes a lot of time and effort. (Liu et al., 2011b) proposed to use Google search engine to automati-cally collect large amount of training pairs. Yet the resulting (work, token) pairs are often noisy, con-taining pairs such as (events,  X  X nts X ), (downtown,  X  X ownto X ), etc. The ideal training data should con-sist of the most frequent nonstandard tokens paired with the corresponding corrections, so that the sys-tem can learn from the most representative letter transformation patterns.

Motivated by research on word sense disambigua-tion (WSD) (Mihalcea, 2007), we hypothesize the nonstandard token and the standard word share a lot of common terms in their global context. For exam-ple,  X  X uv X  and  X  X ove X  share  X  X  X ,  X  X ou X ,  X  X  X ,  X  X t X , etc. among their top context words. Based on this find-ing, we propose to filter out the low-quality train-ing pairs by evaluating the global contextual simi-larity between the word and token. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore this global contextual similarity for the text normalization task.
Given a noisy (word, token) pair, we construct two context vectors v i and v j by collecting the most frequent terms appearing before or after the work/token. We consider two terms on each side of the word/token as context and restrict the vector length to the top 100 terms. The frequency informa-tion were calculated using a large background cor-pus; stopwords were not excluded from the context vector. The contextual similarity of the (word, to-ken) pair is defined as the cosine similarity between the context vectors v i and v j : where w i,k is the weight of term t k within the con-text of term t i . The term weights are defined using a normalized TF-IDF method: where TF i,k is the count of term t k appearing within the context of term t i ; TF i is the total count of t i in of t k appearing in the context of t i ; log( N DF notes the inverse document frequency of t k , calcu-lated as the logarithm of total tweets ( N ) divided by the number of tweets containing t k .

To select the most representative (word, token) pairs for training, we rank the automatically col-lected 46,288 pairs by the token frequency, filter out pairs whose contextual similarity lower than a threshold  X  (set empirically at 0.0003), and retain only the top portion (5,000 pairs) for experiments. 3.1.2 Character-level Sequence Labeling
For a dictionary word s i , we use the conditional random fields (CRF) model to perform character-level labeling to generate its variant t i . In the train-ing stage, we align the collected (word, token) pairs at the character level (Liu et al., 2011b), then con-struct a feature vector for each letter of the dictio-nary word, using its mapped character as the ref-erence label. This aligned data set is used to train a CRF model (Lafferty et al., 2001; Kudo, 2005) with L-BFGS optimization. We use the charac-ter/phoneme n-gram and binary vowel features as in (Liu et al., 2011b), but develop a set of boundary features to effectively characterize the letter trans-formation process.

We notice that in creating the nonstandard tokens, humans tend to drop certain letter units from the word or replace them with other letters. For exam-ple, in abbreviating  X  X dvertisements X  to  X  X ds X , hu-mans may first break the word into smaller units  X  X d-ver-tise-ment-s X , then drop the middle parts. This also conforms with the word construction the-ory where a word is composed of smaller units and construction rules. Based on this assumption, we decompose the dictionary words on the phoneme-, syllable-, morpheme-, and word-level 5 and use the  X  X ILOU X  tagging scheme (Ratinov and Roth, 2009) to represent the unit boundary, where  X  X ILOU X  stands for B(egin), I(nside), L(ast), O(utside), and U(nit-length) of the corresponding unit 6 . Example  X  X ILOU X  boundary tags were shown in Table 2.
On top of the boundary tags, we develop a set of conjunction features to accurately pinpoint the cur-rent character position. We consider conjunction features formed by concatenating character position in syllable and current syllable position in the word (e.g., conjunction feature  X  X  B X  for the letter  X  X  X  in Table 2). A similar set of features are also devel-oped on morpheme level. We consider conjunction of character/vowel feature and their boundary tags on the syllable/morpheme/word level; conjunction of phoneme and phoneme boundary tags, and ab-solute position of current character within the corre-sponding syllable/morpheme/word.
 We use the aforementioned features to train the CRF model, then apply the model on dictionary words s i to generate multiple variations t i for each word. When a nonstandard token is seen during test-ing, we apply the noisy channel to generate a list of best candidate words:  X  s = arg max s 3.2 Visual Priming Approach A second key component of the broad-coverage nor-malization system is a novel  X  X isual Priming X  sub-normalizer. It is built on a cognitively-driven  X  X rim-ing X  effect, which has not been explored by other studies yet was shown to be effective across all our data sets.  X  X riming X  7 is an implicit memory effect caused by spreading neural networks (Tulving and Stark, 1982). As an example, in the word-stem comple-tion task, participants are given a list of study words, and then asked to complete word  X  X tems X  consisting of first 3 letters. A priming effect is observed when participants complete stems with words on the study list more often than with the novel words. The study list activates parts of the human brain right before the stem completion task, later when a word stem is seen, less additional activation is needed for one to choose a word from the study list.

We argue that the  X  X riming X  effect may play an important role in human comprehension of the noisy tokens. A person familiarized with the  X  X ocial talk X  is highly primed with the most commonly used words; later when a nonstandard token shows only minor visual cues or visual stimulus, it can still be quickly recognized by the person. In this process, the first letter or first few letters of the word serve as a very important visual stimulus. Based on this assumption, we introduce the  X  X riming X  subnormal-izer based only on the word frequency and the minor visual stimulus. Concretely, this approach proposes candidate words based on the following equation: Where TF ( s i ) is the term frequency of s i as in the background social text corpus; log( TF ( s i )) primes the system with the most common words in the so-cial text; LCS (  X  ) means the longest common char-acter subsequence; len (  X  ) denotes the length of the vides the minor visual stimulus from t i . Note that the first character has been shown to be a crucial vi-sual cue for the brain to understand jumbled words (Davis, ), we therefore consider as candidates only those words s i that start with the same character as t . In the case that the nonstandard token t i starts with a digit (e.g.,  X 2moro X ), we use the mostly likely corresponding letter to search the candidates (those starting with letter  X  X  X ). This setting also effectively reduces the candidate search space.

The  X  X isual priming X  subnormalizer promotes the candidate words that are frequently used in the so-cial talk and also bear visual similarity with the given noisy token. It slightly deviates from the tradi-tional  X  X riming X  notion in that the frequency infor-mation were acquired from the global corpus rather than from the prior context. This approach also in-herently follows the noisy channel framework, with p ( t i | s i ) represents the visual stimulus and p ( s i ing the logarithm of frequency. The candidate words are ranked by  X  s = arg max s We show that the  X  X riming X  subnormalizer is robust across data sets abide its simplistic representation. 3.3 Spell Checker The third subnormalizer is the spell checker, which combines the string and phonetic similarity algo-rithms and is most effective in normalizing the mis-spellings. We use the Jazzy spell checker (Idzelis, 2005) that integrates the DoubleMetaphone phonetic matching algorithm and the Levenshtein distance us-ing the near-miss strategy, which enables the in-terchange of two adjacent letters, and the replac-ing/deleting/adding of letters. 3.4 Candidate Combination Each of the three subnormalizers is a stand-alone system and can suggest corrections for the nonstan-dard tokens. Yet we show that each subnormal-izer mimics a different perspective that humans use to decode the nonstandard tokens, as a result, our broad-coverage normalization system is built by in-tegrating candidates from the three subnormalizers using various strategies.

For a noisy token seen in the informal text, the most convenient way of system combination is to harvest up to n candidates from each of the sub-normalizers, and use the pool of candidates (up to 3 n ) as the system output. This sets an upper bound for other candidate combination strategies, and we name this approach  X  Oracle  X .

A second combination strategy is to give higher priority to candidates from high-precision subsys-tems. Both  X  X etter Transformation X  and  X  X pell Checker X  have been shown to have high precision in suggesting corrections (Liu et al., 2011b), while  X  X i-sual Priming X  may not yield high precision due to its definition. We therefore take the top-3 candidates from each of the  X  X etter Tran. X  and  X  X pell Checker X  subsystems, but put candidates from  X  X etter Tran. X  ahead of  X  X pell Checker X  if the confidence of the best candidate is greater than a threshold  X  and vice versa. The list of candidates is then compensated us-ing the  X  X isual Priming X  output until the total num-ber reaches n . We name this approach  X  Word-level  X  combination since no message-level context infor-mation is involved.

Based on the  X  X ord-level X  combination output, we can further rerank all the candidates using a message-level Viterbi decoding process (Pennell and Liu, 2011) where the local context information is used to select the best candidate. This approach is named  X  Message-level  X  combination. 4.1 Experimental Setup We use four SMS and Twitter data sets to evaluate the system effectiveness. Statistics of these data sets are summarized in Table 3. Data set (1) to (3) are used for word-level evaluation; data set (4) for both word-and message-level evaluation. In Table 3, we also present the number of distinct nonstandard to-kens found in each data set, and notice that only a small portion of the nonstandard tokens correspond to multiple standard words. We calculate the dic-tionary coverage of the manually annotated words since this sets an upper bound for any normaliza-tion system. We use the Edinburgh Twitter corpus (Petrovic et al., 2010) as the background corpus for frequency calculation, and a dictionary containing 82,324 words. 8 The nonstandard tokens may consist of both numbers/characters and apostrophe.
The goal of word-level normalization is to convert the list of distinct nonstandard tokens into standard words. For each nonstandard token, the system is considered correct if any of the corresponding stan-dard words is among the n-best output from the sys-tem. We adopt this word-level n-best accuracy to make our results comparable to other state-of-the-art systems. On message-level, we evaluate the 1-best system output using precision, recall, and f-score, calculated respective to the nonstandard tokens. 4.2 Word-level Results The word-level results are presented in Table 4, 5, and 6, evaluated on data set (1), (2), (3) respectively. We present the n-best accuracy ( n = 1 , 3 , 10 , 20 ) of the system as well as the  X  X racle X  results generated by pooling the top-20 candidates from each of the three subnormalizers. The best prior results on the data sets are also included in the tables.

We notice that the broad-coverage system outper-forms all other systems on the reported data sets. It achieves about 90% word-level accuracy on data set (1) and (2) with the top-10 candidates (an aver-age 10% performance gain compared to (Liu et al., 2011b)). This is of crucial importance to a normal-ization system, since the high accuracy and limited number of candidates will enable more sophisticated reranking or supervised learning techniques to se-lect the best candidate. We also observe the  X  X ra-cle X  system has averagely only 5% gap to the dic-tionary coverage. A detailed analysis shows that the human annotators perform many semantic/grammar corrections as well as inconsistent annotations, e.g., (sleepy,  X  X zz X ), (disliked,  X  X nliked X ). These are out of the capabilities of the current text normalization system and partly explains the remaining 5% gap.
Regarding the subnormalizer performance, the spell checker yields only 50% to 60% accuracy on all data sets, indicating that the vast amount of the intentionally created nonstandard tokens can hardly be tackled by a system relies solely on the lexi-cal/phonetic similarity. The  X  X isual Priming X  sub-normalizer performs surprisingly well and shows ro-bust performance across all data sets. A minor side-effect is that the candidates were restricted to have the same first letter with the noisy token, this sets the upper bound of the approach to 89.77%, 92.45%, and 93.51%, respectively on data set (1), (2), and (3). Compared to other subnormalizers, the  X  X nhanced Letter Tran. X  is effective at normalizing intention-ally created tokens and has better precision regard-ing its top candidate ( n = 1 ). We demonstrate the context-aware training pair selection results in Fig-ure 2, by plotting the learning curve using different amounts of training data, ranging from 1,000 (word, token) pairs to the total 46,288 pairs. We notice that the system can effectively learn the letter transfor-mation patterns from a small number of high quality training pairs. The final system was trained using the top 5,000 pairs and the lookup table was created by generating 50 variations for each dictionary word. 4.3 Message-level Results The goal of message-level normalization is to re-place each occurrence of the nonstandard token with the candidate word that best fits the local context. We use the word-level  X  X road-Cov. System X  for candidate suggestion and the Viterbi algorithm for message-level decoding. The system is evaluated on data set (4) and results shown in Table 7. Following research in (Han and Baldwin, 2011), we focus on the the normalization task and assume perfect non-standard token detection.

The  X  X ord-level w/o Context X  results are gen-erated by replacing each nonstandard token using the 1-best word-level candidate. Although the re-placement process is static, it results in 70.97% f-score due to the high performance of the word-level system. We explore two language models (LM) for the Viterbi decoding process. First, a bigram LM is trained using the Edinburgh Twitter corpus (53,794,549 English tweets) with the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) and Kneser-Ney smoothing; second, we retrieve the bigram probabilities from the Mi-crosoft Web N-gram API (Wang et al., 2010) since this represents a more comprehensive web-based corpus. During decoding, we use the  X  X isualPrim X  score as the emission probability, since this score best fits the log scale and applies to all candidates. For the Twitter LM, we apply a scaling factor of 0.5 to the  X  X isualPrim X  score to make it compara-ble in scale to the LM probabilities. We use the 3-best word-level candidates for Viterbi decoding. In addition, we add the commonly used corrections for 16 single-characters, e.g., for  X  X  X ,  X  X  X , we add  X  X re X ,  X  X ee X  to the candidate list if they are not already pre-sented. A default  X  X isualPrim X  score (  X  = 25 ) is used for these candidates. As seen from Table 7, both Web LM and Twitter LM achieve better perfor-mance than the best prior results, with Twitter LM outperforms the Web LM, yielding a f-score of 81%. This shows that a vanilla Viterbi decoding process is able to outperform the fine-tuned supervised system given competitive word-level candidates. In future, we will investigate other comprehensive message-level candidate reranking process. In this paper, we propose a broad-coverage normal-ization system for the social media language with-out using the human annotations. It integrates three key components: the enhanced letter transformation, visual priming, and string/phonetic similarity. The system was evaluated on both word-and message-level using four SMS and Twitter data sets. We show that our system achieves over 90% word-coverage across all data sets and the broad word-coverage can be successfully translated into message-level perfor-mance gain. We observe that the social media is an emotion-rich language, therefore future normaliza-tion system will need to address various sentiment-related expressions, such as emoticons ( X :d X ,  X  X -8 X ), interjections ( X  X wahaha X ,  X  X rrrr X ), acronyms ( X  X ol X ,  X  X mao X ), etc., whether and how these expres-sions should be normalized is an unaddressed issue and worths future investigation.
