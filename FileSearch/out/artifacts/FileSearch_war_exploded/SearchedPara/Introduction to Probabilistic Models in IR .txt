 Most of today's state-of-the-art retrieval models, including BM25 and language modeling, are grounded in probabilistic principles. Having a working understanding of these principles can help researchers understand existing retr ieval models better and also provide industrial practitioners with an understanding of how such models can be applied to real world problems. This half-day tutorial will cover the fundamentals of two dominant probabilistic frameworks for Information Retrieval: the classical probabilistic model and the language modeling approach. The elements of the classical framework will include the probability ranking principle, the binary i ndependence model, the 2-Poisson model, and the widely used BM25 model. Within language modeling framework, we will di scuss various distributional assumptions and smoothing technique s. Special attention will be devoted to the event spaces and independence assumptions underlying each approach. The tutorial will outline several techniques for modeling term dependence and addressing vocabulary mismatch. We will also survey applications of probabilistic models in the domains of cross-language and multimedia retrieval. The tutorial will conclude by suggesting a set of open problems in probabilistic models of IR. Attendees should have a basic familiarity with probability and statistics. A brief refresher of basic concepts, including random variables, event spaces, conditional probabilities, and independence will be given at the beginning of the tutorial. In addition to slides, some hands on exercises and examples will be used throughout the tutorial.

He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Am herst in 2004, and worked as a language technology consultant fo r the Credit Suisse Group prior to his appointment at Edinburgh. Victor presented tutorials on language modeling and probabilistic approaches to IR at SIGIR 2003 and SIGIR 2009. He has publishe d research papers in and has reviewed for the SIGIR, CIKM, NAACL/HLT, KDD and NIPS conferences. Victor's research interests include formal models for searching text in multiple languages, annotating and retrieving images, and detecting and tracking novel events in the news.
