 araki@media.eng.hokudai.ac.jp Nowadays, there are numerous Web sites containing personal opinions, e.g. customer reviews of prod-ucts, forums, discussion groups, and blogs. Here, we use the term Weblog for these sites. How to ex-tract and analyze these opinions automatically, i.e.  X  X pinion Mining X , has seen increasing attention in recent years.

This paper presents a simple opinion mining sys-tem (OMS-J) for analyzing Japanese Weblog re-views automatically. The novelty of OMS-J is two-fold: First, it provides a GUI using intuitive visual mining graphs aimed at inexperienced users who want to check opinions on the Weblog before pur-chasing something. These graphs can help the user to make a quick decision on which product is suit-able. Secondly, this system combines a supervised and an unsupervised approach to perform opinion mining. In related work (Chaovalit, 2005; Tur-ney, 2002), both supervised and unsupervised ap-proaches have been shown to have their pros and cons. Based on the merits of these approaches and the characteristics of Japanese (Kobayashi, 2003), we proposed an opinion mining method using a Naive Bayes Classifier (supervised approach) and an improved SO-PMI method (unsupervised approach) to perform different parts of the classification task (Wang, 2006).

OMS-J implements Weblog opinion mining by the steps shown in Figure 1. In the next section, we describe the proposed system in detail. 2.1 Information Search The first step is information search. We used the one product category or one specific product in the Japanese weblog on the Internet. The search key-word is the product category name or the product name. The URL range of the search is restricted by the URL type (e.g. blog, bbs, review). 2.2 Weblog Content Extraction The Content Extraction step first analyzes the We-blog content using a dependency structure analyzer characteristics of Japanese reviews and the results of related work (Kobayashi, 2003; Taku, 2002), we designed the following templates to extract opinion phrases: 2.3 Opinion Mining Opinion mining methods can usually be divided into two types: supervised and unsupervised approaches. Supervised approaches are likely to provide more accurate classification results but need a training cor-pus. Unsupervised approaches on the other hand re-quire no training data but tend to produce weaker results.

We propose a combined opinion mining method by performing feature classification and P/N classi-fication (Wang, 2006). The purpose of these classifi-cations is to know what the opinion expresses about a certain product X  X  features. Feature means a prod-uct X  X  attribute, i.e. price, design, function or battery feature. Based on our previous study, it is easy to create a feature corpus. Therefore feature classifica-tion is performed by a supervised approach, a Naive Bayes Classifier. P/N classification classifies repu-tation expressions into positive or negative meaning using an unsupervised approach, SO-PMI. The SO-PMI approach measures the similarity of pairs of words or phrases based on the mutual information theory, in our case the closeness of an opinion and words for  X  X ood X  or  X  X ad X .

No human effort is required when mining a new product or category. Only inputting the name of the product or category is needed. It does however re-quire quite a lot of processing time, since the SO-PMI approach using a search engine is very time consuming. Adding new features requires manual work, since a small hand labeled training corpus is used. Similar categories of products, for instance cameras and mp3 players, use the same features though, so this is not done very often. 2.4 Mining Graphs GUI Finally, OMS-J provides a GUI with mining graphs showing the opinion mining data in the database, as shown in Figure 2. These graphs show the distribu-tion of positive and negative opinions of each feature type such as  X  X esign X , and for each product. The distribution of positive opinions among the different product choices are shown in a pie chart, as is the same for negative opinions. This GUI can also show graphs for a single product X  X  mining results, show-ing the positive/negative opinion distribution of each feature.
 During the demonstration, we will show that OMS-J is an intuitive opinion mining system that can help people to make a quick decision on purchasing some product. OMS-J X  X  trial version has been developed and tested with three kinds of products: Electronic Dictionaries, MP3 Players and Notebook PCs. The experiment results were positive. We will show how the system works when a user wants to buy a good MP3 player or wants to get a feel for the general opinions on a specific Notebook PC etc.
