 The study of how a person gathers information and makes decisions has a long and varied literature. In the previous research, collective intelligence [13, 19, 23, 27], intel-ligent agent [7, 10, 12, 21, 22], transfer learning [6, 25, 26] and evidence-based reason-ing [4, 8, 14] and other methods are proposed to investigate an agent X  X  learning theory. But due to the new challenges raised in dynamic uncertain environment [11, 17, 18], prior work on this topic is either inefficient or inaccurate. Now consider the following problem.

In our application context, there are 3,187 taxi drivers, and among them there are 25.2% new drivers (less than one year driving experience), 47.1% normal drivers (one to two years driving experience) and 27.7% experienced drivers (greater than two years driving experience). When a driver comes to road to pick up passengers, there are two actions (action set) to choose: waiting at the current location or cruising to other lo-cations. The knowledge of the taxi driver can be described as the histogram of the waiting time before picking up a passenger, the number of picking-ups, and the rev-enue (income) at the given time and location. Given a situation that the drivers come to an unknown road, in a survey of 1,000 taxi drivers, we study how the drivers fol-low their own experienced knowledge and the socialized knowledge (the knowledge obtained from other drivers) to accordingly m ake actions. We find that different drivers have very different learning preferences. The new drivers prefer to follow the socialized knowledge, but the experienced drivers prefe r to follow their experienced knowledge. The standard deviation is larger in new drivers than the experienced drivers. Hence, different drivers would take various knowledge sources.

In our dataset, we also have the communication records to indicate the socialization of taxi drivers. When a new driver was assigned to different group compositions, we studied the income changes (one week). We take 70% as the threshold to define a group composition, e.g., New means more than 70% of the drivers in the group are new drivers. We also tested other thresholds larger than 50%, and the results are very similar. It is very interesting that even the new driver has less social closeness to the Experienced group than the New group, but not only individual income but also total income in the Experienced group have the greater increases than the New group. Hence the more so-cializations may not give the more accurate knowledge and better income. For example, the experienced drivers could give the new d river more accurate knowledge than other drivers.

In a word, the problem is that how the drivers socialize with each other to construct the accurate knowledge in an uncerta in environment, which we define as Socialized Information Learning . To tackle the problem, we have two steps to be accomplished, 1) how to retrieve an accurate knowledge se t for an individual driver in an uncertain environment; 2) how to utilize a social network to learn the information. In this paper, we first propose an Individual Information Model to describe taxi drivers X  information collection, considering the features of the r equired places and the similarity between the required places and the experienced places . Second, we introduce the social network structure with a probability weighting func tion into the model to describe the non-linear socialized information learning, called Socialized Information Model .
 To summarize the contributions of our work, first, we are the first to discover the Socialized Information Learning problem in taxi drivers, and we define it as a new uncertain information learning problem; second, we propose a framework including a series of novel models to solve the socialized information learning problem (not only model taxi drivers X  behaviors by themselv es, but also their social behaviors via the group information) and investigate it in the dynamic field; third, we employ large scale real life datasets to test our models, and the empirical results show that our models outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and scalability.
The paper is structured as follows.In Sec tion 2, we formally define the socialized information learning problem. We propose a series of models to solve the new socialized information learning problem in Section 3, and the empirical experiment results are illustrated and analyzed in Section 4. The related work to our study is surveyed in Section 5. Finally, we conclude our work and give directions to the future work. 2.1 Definitions Definition 1. (Agent) Agent is defined as an entity that is capable of perceiving knowl-edge and accordingly do action.
 In our work, an agent is a taxi driver.
 Definition 2. (Agent group) Agent group is defined as a set of agents that are capable of perceiving knowledge from each other and accordingly do action.
 In our work, an agent group is a predefined group of taxi drivers by a taxi company. We define the knowledge of a taxi driver as experienced knowledge and socialized knowledge as below.
 Definition 3. (Experienced knowledge) The experienced knowledge (EK) is defined as a set of information collected from the agent X  X  own experience, that is, historical records.
 In our work, the experienced knowledge is a set of the CDFs of waiting-time, picking-up and revenue distributions at given locations and times, from a given taxis historical GPS logs and business records. For the road without a given taxi driver X  X  experienced knowledge is called an unknown road.
 Definition 4. (Socialized knowledge) The socialized knowledge (SK) is defined as a set of information collected from other agents X  information in the same group, that is, other agents X  historical records.
 In our work, the socialized knowledge is a set of CDFs of waiting-time, picking-up and income distributions at given locations and times, from a given taxis group members GPS logs and business records at the same given locations and times.
 Definition 5. (Action) Action of an agent is defined as a selection of a mutual exclusion set.
 Action of a taxi driver is defined as cruising or waiting for a passenger. At a given location and time, a taxi driver can select an action (make a decision) of cruising to other locations until picking up a passenger or waiting for a time period at the given location until picking up a passenger.
 Definition 6. (Socialization) Socialization of an agent is defined as a communication between two agents.
 Socialization of a taxi driver is a call between two taxi drivers in the same group. Each location (longitude and latitude) and  X  s is the calling end location.
 Definition 7. (Socialization closeness) Socialization closeness between two agent is defined as a function of communications between the two agents.
 The socialization closeness between two taxi drivers is defined as: Definition 8. (Socialization closeness of taxi drivers) Given two taxi driver i and j in s within the time interval t ,  X  t i,j is where w t f is the weight of an attribute f in the time interval t . The socialization close-taxi drivers in a given group.
 In our study, we take the mean of three attributes ( m =2), the number of calls and the call duration as socialization closeness values. Our solution can be extended to other cases where m&gt; 2 and other functions. The default time interval is set as a minute, which is set by the communication service company. In this work, we equally take the weights in 8, which is predefined by users.

For the input communication data, we can construct a social network, G =( V , E ), where V is a set of nodes (taxi drivers), and E is a set of edges (socialization with socialization closeness as the weight on the edge).
 Definition 9. (Decision knowledge) The decision knowledge (DK) is defined as the information taken by an agent to make an action.
 For a taxi driver, the decision knowledge is based on a set of CDFs of waiting-time, picking-up and income distributions at given locations and times to make a certain action. 2.2 Socialized Information Learning The formal definition of Socialized Information Learning (SIL) is as below.
Given: a set of agents Q , a set of experienced knowledge E , a set of socialized knowledge S , and a social network G with socialization closeness  X  .
 Goal: a set of decision knowledge D .

Specifically, given a taxi driver with expe rienced knowledge and socialized knowl-edge, under a social network, to make a good action to pick up a passenger in an un-known road, what is decision knowledge to support the given taxi driver X  X  action?
In our work, the decision knowledge utilized by a taxi driver to decide the next move is calculated by a decision function as below.
 Definition 10. (Decision function of a Taxi Driver) P [ v t (  X  ) | n t (  X  )  X  ]  X   X  ,where passengers, and  X  are thresholds.
 The above function means if given a probability of a certain number of passenger is greater than a given threshold ( ), the conditional probability of revenue is greater than  X  , the driver is going to wait for passengers at the given location, otherwise, cruise to other locations. 3.1 Individual Information Model The basic idea of Individual Information Model is as follows. First, based on the util-ities of the road and buildings, we label each grid and cluster the grids into different clusters. Second, given a location, we evaluate the similarity between the given location and the taxi X  X  experienced locations. Third, we weight the similar experienced knowl-edge and the socialized knowledge at the given location and time, and finally get the decision knowledge. To make the following expression clear, we take the revenue as a knowledge example to illustrate the model.
 Definition 11. Given a physical location  X  = (x,y) and the report set  X  , the revenue location  X  in  X  , i.e., Since the time is discrete,  X  contains a finite number of reports and thus the revenue spectrum is finite as well.
 Definition 12. The location revenue v ( t )  X  (  X  ) is defined as the average of the revenue spectrum in location  X  at t , In the real data, the revue spectrum is very sparse and lossy, hence we employ a moving average technique to reconstruct a sufficient spectrum as below.
 Definition 13. The experienced revenue knowledge H ( t ) (  X  ) of a given location  X  = ( x,y ) is defined as an exponential moving average of the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the instant revenue over the revenue spectrum, i.e., capture the dynamism of  X  .

The parameter  X   X  is a smoothing factor of exponential moving average in H .Itis used to capture the degree of dynamism of the location dynamics. In general, a smaller  X  indicates a higher dynamism and vice versa. The parameter  X   X  is the interval between two moving averages. It reflects the periodic property of the location dynamics.
Different locations will pr esent distinctive dynamic beh aviors, resulting in various settings. In order to systematically study the speed distribution, we apply Fourier Trans-formation (FT). FT can transform the function from time domain to frequency domain, revealing inherent periodic property of original function as well as the amplitude of the corresponding frequency. Specifically, given the revenue distribution function over time v ( t ) (  X  ) at a location  X  , its FT can be calculated by, where t is the variable. To calculate the H ( t ) (  X  ) , we maintain the location history information for six months. As the computation is carried out at a data center in a centralized manner, the computa-tional and storage cost is acceptable.
 Definition 14. The similarity between the given location and the taxi X  X  experienced locations is defined by the linear correlation coefficient.
 Given the similar experienced revenue knowledge H ( t ) (  X  ) and the socialized revenue knowledge H ( t ) (  X  ) from other drivers, we have the decision revenue knowledge as below. where  X  is a parameter capturing the weight of a t axi driver following the own expe-rienced revenue knowledge, which is determined by users (taxi drivers). In our work, we learned this parameter from the real life d ata, which is elaborated in Section 4. The method to retrieve the socialized revenue knowledge H ( t ) (  X  ) is proposed in the next section. 3.2 Socialized Information Model Given a taxi driver, there exists knowledge limitation (hard to possess the knowledge of the whole city), hence the taxi driver may consult other taxi drivers via a social network G . In this subsection, we propose a Socialized Information Model to learn knowledge from other drivers in a social network.
 Definition 15. ( Socialization probability ) The pr obability p i,j of a given taxi driver i socializing with a taxi driver j is the percentage of socialization closeness between the two drivers over the total socialization closeness among other drivers being socialized by the driver in a given time period.
 Hence the socialized knowledge for a given taxi driver can be described by a probability-based weighting function over a set of knowledge. Under the expected utility theory, a taxi driver weights probabilities of learning information linearly. However, the evidence suggests that the taxi drivers weight pr obabilities i n a non-linear manner. An example is given as following.
 where m is a parameter in generalized mean, det ermining the appropriate mean (in our work, we select as 2). p i,k H ( t ) k (  X  ) in Eq. 6 means the socialized knowledge of driver i from driver j , under the proba bility of driver i being able to access the experienced knowledge of driver k .

Unfortunately, this method does not work well under the following two cases: 1) overweight small probab ilities and underweight large ones (S1); 2) do not choose stochastically dominated options when such dominance is obvious (S2). Hence we uti-lize a probability weighting function to c onduct a non-linear weighting of socialized knowledge.

The particular probability weighting function is where 0 . 5 &lt; X   X  1 , w ( p ) is a weighted probability and p is p i,j in Eq. 6.
After weighting p i,j , we utilize Eq. 6 to compute the socialized knowledge. 4.1 Experiment Setup Datasets Description: We collected one year taxi operatio n data records, including taxi tracking records, taximeter records and comm unication records, in a large city in China. The scale of the whole dataset is almost 1 T erabytes. Taxi tracking records provide taxis X  group information and traces, includi ng location and time information; taxime-ter records provide taxis X  revenue, waiting time and picking-up with location-time logs; communication records provide taxis X  social information, e.g., social closeness. We em-ploy six months data as training data and the other six months data as test data. We also collected one month traffic surveillance video data in the city. The traffic data can pro-vide us the traffic flow, traffic lights, taxis X  picking-up and dropping-off information, which we employ as the ground truth of taxis X  behaviors in the city.
 Experiment Environment: A server with four Intel Core Quad CPUs (Q9550 2.83 GHz) and 32 GB main memory.
 Baseline Methods: We compare our method with two baseline methods: one is the classic method in collective intelligence, called CMM [13], which is popular and gen-erate many latest approaches; the other is t he representative method in agent modeling in intelligent agent and social system, called ABM [21]. The parameter settings of the above two methods in our work follow their parameters in their papers [13, 21]. Evaluation Metrics: In our experiments, we employ time cost, scalability to evaluate efficiency, and precision, recall, and F1 to evaluate effectiveness. 4.2 Parameter Learning Given a taxi driver, we learn the parameters  X  in Eq. 5 from the driver X  X  historical behaviors as follows. When the driver comes to an unknown road, if the driver makes no call to other drivers to consult the given road X  X  information, we assume the driver follow the own experienced knowledge; else if the driver makes calls to other drivers who have the experienced knowledge of the given road , and the given driver accordingly makes an action, we assume the driver follow the socialized knowledge. Based on the records in the historical data, we can have the percentage of a given driver X  X  follow behavior. In our study, we take the percentage of following the own experienced knowledge as  X  . For different drivers,  X  is different and updating along the new records coming to the dataset. The parameter updating is intuitive which is not elaborated in the paper. In the following experiments, we utilize the percentage number as the parameter. 4.3 Effectiveness Evaluation We evaluate effectiveness by precision , recall ,and F1 . Precision is the fraction of re-trieved results that are relevant to the sear ch, that is, the number of waiting/ cruising actions resulting from our model over the number of all waiting/ cruising actions made by taxis resulting from our model. Recall is the fraction of retrieved results that are rele-vant to the query that are successfully retrieved, that is, the number of waiting/ cruising actions resulting from our model over the number of all waiting cruising actions made by taxis.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we design two categories of experi-ments.
 Category 1: effectiveness in different driver categories. The results of our method are listed in Table 1. DC is the driver category, N is the number of drivers in the category, Pis Precision ,Ris recall ,andFis F1 . The results of ABM are listed in Table 2. In our experiment, CMM returns much worse results than ABM.
 Category 2: effectiveness in different drivers, groups and time series. We conducted precision , recall ,and F1 tests in different drivers, groups and time series. Due to page limitation, we only show the precision results. In Figure 1 (a) and (b), we test the accu-racy in one month data. The results show th at our method returns much more accurate results than the baseline methods, not only in different drivers scenario, but also in different groups. In a conclusion, our met hod X  X  accuracy is much better than baseline methods, and the accuracy also shows great scalability. 4.4 Efficiency Evaluation We conducted efficiency tests in different drivers, groups and time series. The efficiency is measured by the time cost in a knowledge learning process. In Figure 2 (a) and (b), we test the efficiency in one month data. The results show that our method costs much less time than the baseline methods, not only in different drivers scenario, but also in different groups. In a conclusion, our method X  X  efficiency is much more better than baseline methods, and the efficiency also shows great scalability. In [9], they proposed an approach to the problem of driving an autonomous vehicle in normal traffic. In [1], they discussed the spatial dispersion problem. But the work in this category either does not consider the s ocial structure to retrieve the accurate information, or does not consider the dynamics in the learning process. In organized learning theory, this category work assumes that the sum of individual knowledge does not equate to organizational knowledge [2, 3, 5, 15, 16, 24]. In [4], they studied the distinction between individual knowledge and organizational knowledge, and prove the assumption. In [21], Ronald et al. demonstrated the design and implementation of an agent-based model of social activity generation. Szuba et al. [23] attempted to for-mally analyze the problem of individual existence of a being versus its existence in a social structure through the evaluation of co llective intelligence efficiency. Heylighen et al. [13] argued that the obstacles created by individual cognitive limits and the dif-ficulty of coordination could be overcome by using a collective mental map (CMM). Deng et al. [7] explored the use of active learning techniques to design more efficient trials. Rettinger et al. [20] studied the learning of trust and distrust in social interaction among autonomous, mentally-opaque agents. Wang et al. [25] presented an algorithm for finding the structural similarity between two domains, to enable transfer learning at a structured knowledge level. Cao et al. [6] proposed an adaptive transfer learning algo-rithm to adapt the transfer learning schemes by automatically estimating the similarity between a source and a target task. Zhu et al. [27] turned the co-training algorithm into a human collaboration policy. Unfortunately current work can not work well in our so-cialized information learning because of the challenges from dynamic updating along the time and large scale socializations. In this paper, we model the social information learning among taxi drivers and employ large scale real life data and empirical experiments to confirm our models in terms of much better effectiveness, efficiency and scalability than the state-of-the-art. Our models could be relevant to other domains, e.g., studying animal behavior, or where people go to sell things. We leave taxi driver decision model as the future work. How to model taxi driver X  X  decision based on their collected information is a very interesting but challenging topic. Our current work can make such future work on the accurate and updated information.
