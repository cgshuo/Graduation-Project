 Information retrieval applications and research have a lon g tradition as first a u tomatic search systems were introd u ced back in the 1950  X  s. The idea of a u tomatically retriev-in g information from a di g ital collection can be tr aced back to Vannevar B u sh 1945  X  s mostly fo u nded on the works of Gerard Salton and Sparck Jones [2-5]. 
Ori g inally, the scope of information retrieval applications was restricted to arc-hives, libraries and other doc u ment collections. However, nowadays, with the explo-sion of information access provided by the World Wide Web, information retrieval has become a daily-life commodity for a h ug e proportion of the world  X  s pop u lation. 
Main c u rrent information retrieval systems, s u ch as those provided by Goo g le (www. g oo g le.com), Yahoo (www.yahoo.com), and Microsoft (www.bin g .com), g en-erate a one-dimensional ranked list of res u lts. The retrieved doc u ments are or g anized contain millions of doc u ments, are presented in a set of pa g es, each of which contains a more reasonable n u mber of doc u ments that g enerally ran g es from ten to a h u ndred. lows the u ser to navi g ate to the correspondin g doc u ment or website) and a snippet (a short se g ment of text aimin g at providin g a description of the doc u ment content). first of these problems, and probably the most important one, is the fact that explorin g doc u ments, in practice, the u ser is able to explore only the first ten or twenty res u lts. As a conseq u ence, c u rrent search en g ines are desi g ned to achieve very hi g h precision (first ranked doc u ments are act u ally relevant to the q u ery) while recall is, most of the res u lts). 
Some systems are already tacklin g with this major deficiency of traditional web-(http://search.carrot2.or g ), which, in addition to the conventional ranked list of doc u -so u rce. As example of these en g ines, we can mention Hakia (http://www.hakia.com) and SenseBot (http://www.sensebot.net). Finally, a more recent effort that m u st be mentioned is the case of Qwiki (http://www.qwiki.com), where main efforts are bein g invested in the compilation of retrieved information into a sin g le coherent m u ltimedia informative experience. somehow related to the first one, is the low level of interactivity offered to the u ser for explorin g the collection of retrieved doc u ments. In o u r opinion, this problem is main-ly d u e to two factors: a lack of immediate feedback at the vis u alization interface and a poor vis u alization scheme. Re g ardin g the lack of immediate feedback, with the excep-tion of the  X  X emix X  option offered by Yippy and the  X  X ore like this X  modality offered applications req u ires the u ser to modify the ori g inal q u ery and cond u ct a new search. 
Re g ardin g the vis u alization scheme, a recent advance in this area, which has been implemented by the major web-search en g ines, incl u des the possibility of previewin g snippet. A similar strate g y is implemented by Lycos (http://search.lycos.com) in a presentation of cl u sters as sectors of a rin g (as offered by Carrot), the u se of tabs for showin g and hidin g cate g ories of doc u ments (as offered by Hakia) and the u se of ta g -clo u ds for presentin g relevant terminolo g y and concepts (as offered by SenseBot and by SpaceTime 3D (http://search.spacetime.com) and Redz (http://redz.com), is the u se of a slideshow of doc u ment ima g es that the u ser can scan over in a simple manner. Section 2, a brief review of previo u s work related to doc u ment search res u lt vis u aliza-tion in 2D and 3D is presented. Then, in section 3, the proposed comparative eval u a-tion and the two methods to be compared are described. In section 4, the experimental concl u sions of o u r work are presented. The specific problem of vis u alizin g doc u ment collections and lar g e datasets is act u al-ly of lar g er scope than web-search applications. In this sense, we will also review here proposed technolo g y. low dimensional maps from hi g h dimensional data [6]. The idea of this techniq u e is to g enerate an optimal low dimensional embeddin g ( g enerally 2 or 3 dimensions) from a embeddin g and the distances (or similarities) in the ori g inal space. The main p u rpose 
More recent approaches to the same problem of comp u tin g low dimensional em-g enerally referred to as Semantic Mappin g [12]. 
Notice that for vis u alization p u rposes, the dimensionality red u ction has to be con-d u cted to dimensions as low as 2 or 3. The res u ltin g maps can be presented as either an interconnected or u nconnected g raph of elements, where elements can be doc u -ments, concepts or cate g ories (cl u sters of doc u ments). Several works have addressed retrieval applications s u ch as M u sicplasma (www.m u sicplasma.com), Eye P lorer (http://eye P lorer.com) and Search-C u be (www.search-c u be.com). VIBE system (Vis u al Information Browsin g Environment) [16], and the S P IRE sys-case, two specific vis u alization methods: Galaxies and Themescapes, are described. 
In the case of the VIBE system, search res u lts are commonly presented in a two-dimensional space, altho ug h some versions of VIBE interfaces allow for three-g enerated representation space, some points of interest ( P OIs) are displayed alon g with the doc u ments. Typically, the P OIs are defined by the q u ery terms the u ser has introd u ced for cond u ctin g the search. Each doc u ments is then located over the g eome-trical simplex defined by the different combinations of P OIs dependin g on the specif-ic q u ery terms contained in it. Altho ug h doc u ment retrieval is act u ally performed on a binary base, doc u ment placement over the representation space is cond u cted by u sin g plementation [16], the specific location of doc u ments within the map is comp u ted by u se of different physical metaphors for doc u ment location, as for example the Web-VIBE system [19], which implements a  X  X a g netic force X  mechanism. At the vis u ali-and/or movin g aro u nd the different P OIs. 
In the case of the S P IRE system, it constit u tes a method for vis u alization and anal-ysis of text u al information, which was developed u nder the MVAB (M u ltidimension-al Vis u alization and Advanced Browsin g ) project [20]. As already mentioned, two oriented vis u alization method, is based on a metaphor of g alaxies. Accordin g to this, a two-dimensional scatter plot of  X  X oc u points X  or  X  X tarfield X  is u sed to represent doc u -ments and cl u sters, as well as their correspondin g interrelations. Each  X  X oc u points X  in the res u ltin g map can be interactively explored by the u ser. 
The second method in S P IRE is a topic-oriented vis u alization method that is based on a landscape metaphor. In this case, relevant information is depicted in a three-dimensional abstract landscape of informa tion called  X  X hemescapes X , which aims at means of hills and valleys. The main objective of this kind of vis u alization is to pro-vide a g lobal perspective of the most relevant topics and themes contained into a g iv-en data collection by revealin g the interconnections amon g topics thro ug h vis u al spa-tial relationships within the constr u cted three-dimensional landscapes of information. selected for o u r comparative analysis between 2D and 3D vis u al exploration of doc-u ment search res u lts, as well as the main objective of the proposed eval u ation. 3.1 2D Document Search and Visualization Platform For 2D doc u ment search and exploration, the p u blicly available search interface Search P oint (www.searchpoint.com) was selected. This interface is ill u strated in Fi g . 1. can be presented in the pa g e, a pa g ination system allows for movin g forward into the tail of the ranked list. 
The novel feat u re of Search P oint is that it also presents a thematic map (see ri g ht hand side of Fi g . 1), in which different keywords are arran g ed on a two-dimensional c u rrent rankin g has been performed. When the u ser moves the red dot over the differ-in the left hand side of the interface is u pdated accordin g ly. 3.2 3D Document Search and Visualization Platform interface, Doc u ment P lanet, was u sed. This interface is ill u strated in Fi g 2. 
In the Doc u ment P lanet vis u alization interface, a two dimensional rankin g of doc-u ser can vis u alize the doc u ment  X  s related information (title, snippet and web link) by placin g the c u rsor over the correspondin g dot in the sphere (see Fi g . 2). However, different from Search P oint, in this case the thematic map is embedded into the s u rface of the sphere in which the different keywords are spatially arran g ed over the s u rface where the doc u ments are located. This allows to sim u ltaneo u sly vis u aliz-in g doc u ments and  X  X hematic re g ions X  over the same s u rface. The u ser can  X  X xplore X  different operations s u ch as rotation, zoom in and zoom o u t. 
As an additional feat u re of Doc u ment P lanet, the thematic keywords are defined at appear that correspond to more  X  X e g ional X  cate g ory labels. Then, if the u ser contin u es zoomin g in, doc u ment titles will be displayed at each doc u ment location at the hi g hest resol u tion level. 
At any moment d u rin g the navi g ation process, the u ser is able to display at the bot-doc u ment by j u st placin g the c u rsor over it. 3.3 Proposed Evaluation As the main objective of the proposed eval u ation is to compare the u sef u lness of both performance is needed from both search en g ines in order to gu arantee a fair compara-tive eval u ation. ments was displayed by both platforms for each q u ery search res u lt. This allowed the the proposed comparative eval u ation:  X 
What method is most rob u st in terms of the s u ccess rate on doc u ment search?  X  What method is faster in terms of avera g e search time on doc u ment search? 
Different u sers were req u ested to complete some specific information search tasks Search P oint and Doc u ment P lanet, were u sed for completin g the tasks. comparative eval u ation of 2D and 3D vis u al exploration of doc u ment search o u tp u ts. 4.1 Experimental Setup To g enerate the eval u ation datasets, three different and g eneric q u eries were defined: eval u ation independent of the search res u lts, the same set of doc u ments were u sed for both interfaces. As we act u ally can control what is displayed by Doc u ment P lanet, b u t cannot control what is displayed by Search P oint, the implemented proced u re was as follows: trieve a list of doc u ments. 2. The res u ltin g list of doc u ments (titles, snippets and web links) were saved for each q u ery. 3. The saved doc u ment information was u sed to g enerate the correspondin g maps and 
P lanet platform. 4. The same search res u lts from Search P oint were displayed by the Doc u ment P lanet interface for each of the three defined q u eries. explore exactly the same set of doc u ments by u sin g both of the interfaces. In order to req u ested to cond u ct the experiments in the reversed order. 
The tasks were defined as simple q u estions that had to be answered by explorin g web link was eno ug h to answer each of the posted q u estions. defined for each doc u ment s u ch that the answer was evident from the available infor-presented in Table 1. 
For each task, each u ser was g iven a time limit of 60 seconds. If the participant was not able to accomplish the task, it was co u nted as a fail u re. On the other hand, if the data:  X  s u ccess rate = n u mber of completed tasks / total n u mber of tasks * 100%  X  of completed tasks was also cond u cted by means of a brief s u rvey. After completin g all the proposed 15 tasks, each participant was asked abo u t his/her preference between Search P lanet and also provided). P references were eval u ated re g ardin g the followin g iss u es:  X 
Which interface is easier to u se?  X 
Which interface is more int u itive to u se?  X 
Which interface allows findin g the req u ested information faster?  X 
Which interface provides a better idea of the contents of the collection?  X 
Which interface or g anizes the information in a better way?  X 
Which interface is more interactive and dynamic?  X  Which interface wo u ld yo u definitively prefer to u se? search en g ines and comp u ter interfaces. The pop u lation was composed of 3 research-ers, 4 st u dents and 1 en g ineer. Re g ardin g g ender, the pop u lation was composed by 2 female participants and 6 male participants. 4.2 Experimental Results the 15 considered tasks and both search and vis u alization platforms. 
Composers 
As seen from Table 2, in the overall eval u ation, Search P oint demonstrated to be a faster search mechanism (as the avera g e time for the accomplished task is 24.80 62.50%, compared to 45.83% in the case of Search P oint). inferred from them, respectively. Notice from the table and the fi gu re how, altho ug h net paradi g m is preferred over the Search P oint one. It is interestin g to notice the in-Doc u ment P lanet re g ardin g search speed) and the q u antitative one, in which avera g e times for accomplished tasks are lower for Search P oint! search and vis u alization interface happened to achieve a hi g her s u ccess rate than 2D of avera g e search time. 
Amon g the several facts that can explain this, we can mention the followin g two as the most important ones:  X  u sers are m u ch more familiar with 2-D interfaces than with 3-D interfaces, and  X  ima g e renderin g in the c u rrent implementation of o u r 3D search and vis u alization interface is still la gg y and slow. 
One point of attention sho u ld be raised re g ardin g the detected inconsistency be-eval u ation, which revealed the participants perception abo u t the 3D search and vis u a-lization method allowin g for faster search than the 2D one. 
One possible explanation of this inconsistency can be the fact that tasks were de-searches over the 2D one than over the 3D, so u nconscio u sly they mi g ht be associat-in g s u ccess rates to lower avera g e search times. 
One of the most important res u lts of this eval u ation are the potential improvements the response of the g raphic renderin g d u rin g navi g ation, amon g others. Acknowledgements.
