 1. Introduction lot of researchers. With including robotic arms and mobile plat-form, the structure of the mobile manipulator robot is subject to kinematic and dynamic constraints, which make it a highly coupled dynamic nonlinear system. Many control strategies for the mobile robot manipulator system have been successfully developed in various literatures and applied in practical applica-tions. Based on the assumption of known dynamics, some researchers have constructed controllers by applying the feedback techniques ( Yamamoto and Yun, 1996; Khatib, 1999; Watanabe et al., 2000; Tan et al., 2003 ). Inoue et al. (2001) proposed a disturbance observer to estimate the external forces that had adverse impacts on the mobile manipulator robot system. Tsai et al. (2006) have applied the backstepping technique and the manipulator robot control system to compensate the dynamic interactions (non-holonomic constrain) and guarantee the path tracking. The knowledge of the mobile manipulator robot system requirement of the known dynamics are not easy to apply in real control applications. This problem can be solved with the adaptive control techniques ( Dong, 2002; Li et al., 2007a, 2008, 2010b, an adaptive control scheme based on a suitable reduced dynamic model for the mobile manipulator robot to guarantee performance of the tracking position and the non-holonomic constraint force.
However, the disturbances and friction problems were not con-and Kang (2010a) have proposed and developed several adaptive robust control strategies for the mobile manipulator robot system that guaranteed not only the performance of the tracking errors and holonomic/non-holonomic constraint force but also the uncertain parameters and disturbances elimination.
 neural networks (NNs) are also the useful methods to deal with the unknown/uncertain dynamics problem of the mobile manip-good approximation capabilities ( Omidvar and Elliott, 1997; Jang 1996a, 1996b; Kim and Lewis, 1999; Lin and Goldenberg, 2001; Lin and Goldenberg (2001) proposed an adaptive NNs controller to identify online the dynamics of the mobile manipulator robot and eliminate disturbances. But the parameters of the Gaussian func-force/motion controller for the mobile manipulator robot in the presence of an unknown dynamic model and an uncertain con-straint. In ( Xu et al., 2009 ), a robust neural network based on sliding mode controller, which has used the NNs to identify the unstructured system dynamics directly, is proposed. This control-ler is capable of disturbance rejection in the presence of unknown disturbances bound, but the assumption of the bounded para-meters, the fi xed parameter and approximation errors of the NNs still need to be improved.

Fuzzy NNs (FNNs) are the combination of the NNs and fuzzy that contains both the interpretability of the fuzzy logics and Therefore, the NNs have a good support for the fuzzy system in tuning the fuzzy rules and membership functions ( Jang, 1993; 2005; Wai and Chen, 2006; Chen, 2008; Li and Chen, 2008 ;). For the mobile robot manipulator control, Mbede et al. (2005) devel-oped a modular fuzzy navigation method in changing dynamic unstructured environments. In this method, the integration of a robust controller and a modi fi ed Elman NNs is to deal with uncertainties. However, the bounded-parameters (disturbances, Taylor parameters) are assumed to be known. The aforementioned applications presented the FNNs-structures that were only capable feed-forward network structure. The disadvantage of the feed-forward network structure is presented in the requiring of a large number of neurons to capture dynamical responses in the time-domain, and its approximating-ability is sensitive to the training data. To overcome this drawback, the recurrent FNNs (RFNNs) ( Lin and Wai, 2003; Hsu and Cheng, 2008; Wai and Liu, 2009; Chen, 2010; Park and Han, 2011 ) have been proposed to associate the dynamic structures in the form of the feedback links employed as internal memories. Therefore, the RFNNs have a dynamic mapping and they present a good control performance under uncertainties variation. In ( Lin and Wai, 2003 ), the authors proposed a robust RFNNs control system to improve the tracking position performance and the RFNNs-controller was used to mimic an ideal feedback linearization control law. This proposed scheme relaxed the requirement for the bound of the lumped uncertainty should be more considered. Hsu and Cheng (2008) presented a dynamic RFNNs scheme with a structure-learning strategy that enabled to determine the nodes dynamically and achieve the optimal network structure. In ( Hsu and Cheng, 2008 ), the RFNNs also mimicked an ideal controller and a compensation-controller was designed to compensate the difference between the NNs scheme were derived by the Lyapunov theorem, so the stability was guaranteed but the constraint bound of some parameters in the controller required to be known. Park and Han (2011) devel-oped a model-free RFNNs control system to approximate the ideal backstepping control law. In addition, in this method, a simple dead-zone estimator and a friction compensator were applied to estimate the unknown dead-zone width and friction-parameters. Although the algorithms of the estimator and the compensator were derived by using the Lyapunov theorem but the online-learning algorithm of the RFNNs-parameters was determined by Gradient descent method, so the learning rate-factors were not easy to obtain. In general, the controllers-based NNs have the advantages in the control applications but they still contain some obstacles need to be improved, such as the learning speed, the approximation errors and poor convergence problems.

Recently, wavelets NNs (WNNs) have also attracted a lot of attention from researchers. The WNNs combine the learning capability of NNs and the decomposition capability of the wavelet function ( Zhang and Benveniste, 1992; Delyon et al., 1995; Zhang able to overcome drawbacks of the FNNs/NNs, especially in the highly nonlinear dynamic systems. The WNNs can converge faster; achieve smaller approximation errors and size of networks than the NNs ( Zhang and Benveniste, 1992; Zhang, 1997 ). Several controllers-based WNNs have been proposed in literatures ( Wai and Chang, 2003; Yoo et al., 2006a, 2006b; Lin et al., 2006; Hu, 2009 ). In these control applications, the WNNs have been applied to approximate the unknown dynamics of the controlled systems. The adaptive robust techniques were often combined with the WNNs to improve learning laws of WNNs parameters that were determined by the Lyapunov stability theorem ( Wai and Chang, 2003; Yoo et al., 2006a; Lin et al., 2006 ). The main advantage of these adaptive learning laws is that the stability of the control systems is guaranteed. Some researchers presented the learning laws of the WNNs with the gradient descent algorithm, but we should pay attention to the adaptive learning rate and momentum parameters to ensure the stability of control systems, 2009 ).

In accordance with the advantages in many previous control applications, the WNNs and the RFNNs shall be considered in our work. In recent years, Fuzzy WNNs (FWNNs) have been presented in some application areas ( Ho et al., 2001; Abiyev and Kaynak, 2008; Yilmaz and Oysal, 2010; Lu, 2011; Hsu, 2011; Davanipoor et al., 2012; Bodyanskiy and Vynokurova, 2013 ). The FWNNs, the combination of fuzzy concept and the WNNs, can bring the low level learning and good computational capability of the WNNs into fuzzy system and also high humanlike IF-THEN rule thinking and reasoning of fuzzy system into the WNNs. Based on the theory of multiresolution of wavelet transforms and the fuzzy concept, Ho et al. (2001) proposed a FWNNs structure for approximating arbitrary nonlinear functions. By tuning the shape of the member-ship functions, the approximating process of the FWNNs could be improved without increasing the number of wavelet bases. Some researchers ( Abiyev and Kaynak, 2008; Yilmaz and Oysal, 2010; Lu, 2011; Davanipoor et al., 2012; Bodyanskiy and Vynokurova, gradient method to update/adjust the parameters of the networks (translations, dilations of fuzzy wavelet functions and weights of networks). The results of these methods have good performance and achieve higher precision than FNNs or WNNs methods. Hsu (2011) proposed an adaptive FWNNs controller with the adaptive update laws based on Lyapunov theory. In this method, the training of the FWNNs converged in a smaller number of iterations and the performance of FWNNs achieved better approximation-accuracy in comparison with the NNs. Therefore, in our proposed method, we decide to apply the adaptive FWNNs to deal with the high dynamics and constraints of the mobile manipulator robot system.
In this study, an adaptive position/force tracking control scheme for the mobile manipulator robot using the RFWNNs is proposed. In the RFWNNs structure, a recurrent unit is added into the FWNNs to guarantee the RFWNNs can overcome the static problem of the FWNNs. Our proposed controllers are designed without requiring the knowledge of the robotic control system. The approximation capability of the RFWNNs is applied in the main controller to deal with the unknown highly coupled dynamics of the robot controlled system. The purpose of this approach is to improve the adaptive ability and the tracking performance of the mobile manipulator robot control system under the time-varying uncertainty conditions. An adaptive robust compensator (RC) is also proposed to compensate uncertainties including inevitable approximation errors, unknown disturbances the controlled system. In addition, an adaptive robust constraint force control is also considered to cope with the non-holonomic constraint problem. The adaptive online learning of the RFWNNs parameters, RC and the adaptive robust constraint force controller are derived based on the Lyapunov stability theorem such that the stability of the controlled system is guaranteed. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the dynamics of the mobile manipulator robot and the RFWNNs structure. In
Section 3 , the adaptive control algorithm is presented. The comparative simulation and experimental results for the cleaning mobile manipulator robot are included in Section 4 . Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5 . 2. Preliminaries 2.1. System description manipulators mounted on a mobile platform; they can be expressed as the following Lagrange form ( Li et al., 2008 ):

And according to Eq. (9) , the dynamics of the mobile manipulator robot in Eq. (1) can be rewritten as the following form: M  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  q  X  X  M  X   X   X  _  X   X   X   X   X  X  C  X   X  ; _  X  where u  X  B ( q )  X  .

Recurrent fuzzy wavelet neural networks
The proposed RFWNNs' structure is the combination of the recurrent unit and the FWNNs. Here, the FWNNs structure consists of Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) ( Takagi and Sugeno, 1985 ) fuzzy system and the WNNs. The TSK-FWNNs model is constructed on sub-WNNs space. In this TSK-FWNNs structure, each sub-WNNs tion). Thus, the sub-WNNs at different resolution levels can capture different behaviors of the approximated function. In fact, the contribution of the sub-WNNs space to the output of FWNNs is determined by the fuzzy set. Therefore, based on the appropriate rules in our study, each output of the proposed FWNNs in the RFWNNs structure is constructed to contain a wavelet basic function with multiresolution capability. With the main feature stated above, the proposed FWNNs can improve the accuracy of the approximation process in terms of dilation and translation parameters of the wavelet functions without increasing the number of wavelet bases ( Ho et al., 2001 ), or it can achieve the same approximation accuracy with a smaller size in comparison with the FNNs/NNs ( Delyon et al., 1995; Jin and Liu, 2008 ). In addition, the appearance of the feedback loop with time-delay at the FWNNs fuzzi fi cation layer will make RFWNNs become a dynamic structure that has enough ability to deal with highly dynamics of the mobile manipulator robot. Fig. 2 shows the structure of the proposed RFWNNs, which is explained as follows:
Layer 1(input layer) : Each node in this layer, which corre-sponds to one input signal.

Layer 2(fuzzi fi cation) : In this layer, the fuzzy membership function  X  A j  X  feedback unit with the real time delay part is added into this layer. Therefore, the input of this layer will be represented as x  X  t  X  X  x i  X  t  X  X   X  ri  X  A j where the membership function  X  A j delay value of  X  A j
Layer 3(fuzzy rules layer) : Each neuron in this layer is represented as a rule and it performs precondition matching of a rule. Moreover, we use AND operator to calculate the outputs of this layer:  X   X   X  w the rule layer, which is assumed to be unity. In this paper, the fuzzy wavelet basic function is constructed as  X   X  x r  X  X   X  j  X  where  X  ji  X  x i  X  X  1 d 2 ji  X  x i c ji  X  2 , x r  X  [ x r 1 let basic function, so its multi-dimensional function can be expressed as  X   X  x r  X  X   X  Hat wavelet function ( Abiyev and Kaynak, 2008; Yilmaz and Oysal, 2010; Hsu, 2011; Davanipoor et al., 2012 ).

Layer 4(fuzzy output layer) : Each node in this layer expresses the output linguistic variable, which computes the overall output as the summation of all input signals y  X   X  where w lj is the weight between the rule layer and the output The output can be denoted as the following vector form: y  X  x ; d ; c ;  X  ; W  X  X  W T  X   X  x r ; d ; c ;  X   X  X  20  X  where x  X  [ x 1 , ... , x n ] T A R n 1 , y  X  X  y 1 ; y 2 ; ... ; d vector, c  X  [ c 11 , ... , c n 1 , c 12 , ... , c n 2 , ... lation parameter vector,  X   X  [  X  11 , ... ,  X  n 1 ,  X  12 , R np 1 is the recurrent weight parameter vector,  X  ( x r , d , c , [
 X  1 ( x r ),  X  2 ( x r ), ... ,  X  p ( x r )] T A R p 1 , W
The structure of the FWNNs in the proposed RFWNNs is different from some methods ( Ho et al., 2001; Abiyev and Kaynak, 2008; Yilmaz and Oysal, 2010; Lu, 2011; Hsu, 2011; part of the fuzzy rules; the proposed FWNNs' rules contain a part the outputs of the FWNNs. Here, the simple fi ring strength of the rules is built to increase the computational speed of the FWNNs. In addition, by adding the recurrent units into the RFWNNs' structure, the approximating capability of the RFWNNs becomes more fl exible, robust in the presence of the time varying condi-tions and the high uncertainty dynamics.
 In this paper, we have no knowledge of the robotic system. Therefore, the proposed RFWNNs is applied to deal with the unknown/uncertain dynamics of the mobile robot manipulator control system. The RFWNNs are applied in the main controller to approximate the dynamics of the controlled system. Based on the there exists an ideal RFWNNs structure with its optimal parameter such that ( Lewis et al., 1996a ): y o  X  x  X  t  X  X  X  W n T  X  n  X  x r  X  t  X  ; d n ; c n ;  X  n  X  X

Hence, besides the advantages for universal approximation, a few drawbacks still exist. The multiresolution RFWNNs may create a huge network size that the selection of wavelength becomes rules alone may fail to control a system under some conditions. to be adjusted adaptively. Therefore, an approach for adaptation algorithm for the dilation, translation parameters, and weights of the RFWNNs will be developed in the following section. 3. Adaptive control algorithm dent.

In this paper, the desired continuous, it has bounded and uniformly continuous derivatives up to the second orders.  X  nd is also bounded and uniformly continuous. The structure of the proposed controllers is described in Fig. 3 .

Therefore we shall consider the control input u in the following form: u  X  u  X  A T u n  X  24  X  for the torque and the non-holonomic constrained force. Eqs. (12) and (13) as follows:
M q  X  q  X  C q _ q  X  G q  X   X  qd  X  Z T  X  u  X   X  25  X   X  n  X   X   X  X  M _  X   X   X  C  X   X   X  _ q  X  G  X   X  d u  X   X  u n  X   X  Z where Z  X   X   X  X  Z T  X  Z  X   X  1 Z T  X  .

(27) and (28) to be zero then close-loop control system  X  M error ( Lewis et al., 1996a ) but also the tracking performance of Hence, the ideal control laws for the position/force tracking control can be designed as Z u n  X   X  y  X   X  qd  X  K r r  X  29  X  u  X   X  Z  X  T  X  M q  X  q  X   X  nd K  X  e  X   X  30  X  However, we cannot implement these ideal feedback controllers owing to various kinds of uncertainties and because of not having any knowledge of the robotic system. Therefore, we need adaptive/ robust controllers that can identify online the unknown para-meters of the robot control system. With this analysis, we propose an adaptive controller based on the RFWNNs with adaptive/robust algorithms to approximate the unknown parameters of the robot control system. In addition, with the existence of inevitable approximation errors and disturbances of the mobile manipulator system, we shall also propose a robust compensation term to compensate the existing problems. And with the constraint force control problem, an adaptive controller will be proposed. 3.1. Position tracking controller design
The ideal control law (29) depends on the unknown dynamics of the mobile robot manipulator model (1). The part y will be approximated by the proposed RFWNNs. The part  X  qd is the uncertain disturbances that may contain unstructured parts of the robot model. In addition, the approximation of the RFWNNs always generates inevitable approximation errors. Therefore, a robust term is proposed in order to estimate and compensate the  X  qd and the approximation errors. An actual torque control law is proposed as follows: Z u  X   X  ^ y  X  ^ u dr  X  K r r  X  31  X  ^ u dr is the robust term that is used to eliminate the uncertainties such as the approximation errors, unknown disturbances, unstruc-tured parts of the robot model. The part ^ y is the approximation function of function y and it can be represented as ^ y  X  ^ W T  X   X  x  X  t  X  ; ^ d ; ^ c ; ^  X   X  X  32  X  where x  X  X  q T ; _ q T ; q T d ; _ q T d ;  X  q T d T , ^ y values of y , W n , d n , c n ,  X  n , respectively.

By applying the position control law (31) to the dynamics of the mobile manipulator system (25) , the closed-loop control system can be expressed as follows: M _ r  X  ~ y  X  K r  X  C q  X  r  X   X  qd ^ u dr  X  33  X  where the approximation error ~ y is de fi ned as: ~ y  X  y ^ y  X  W n T  X  n  X  x ; d n ; c n ;  X  n  X  ^ W T  X   X  x For ease, notation (34) can be rewritten as ~ y  X  W n T ~  X   X  ~ W T ^  X   X   X   X  35  X  where  X  n  X   X  x ; d n ; c n ;  X  n  X  ; ^  X   X   X  x ; ^ d ; ^
We can realize that the closed-loop dynamics (33) from ~ y to r is an important feature of our closed-loop control system, which may guarantee the boundedness of the system control signals. In general, a hybrid-NNs controller cannot be guaranteed to be passive if we do not give an appropriate updating law for the parameters of the networks. Hence, the proposed controller must ensure good tracking, the stability of the controlled system with the weights, dilations, and the translations of the RFWNNs are adjusted online. To achieve this, the linearization technique is applied to transform the nonlinear output of the RFWNNs into a partially linear form ( Lewis et al., 1996a ) so that the Lyapunov theorem extension can be applied. Thus, we will take the expan-sion of ~  X  in a Taylor series to obtain the following form: ~  X   X  I T  X  d n ^ d  X  X  K T  X  c n ^ c  X  X  H T  X   X  n ^  X   X  X   X   X  d where  X  is the vector of higher-order terms in Taylor series expansion, assume that I , K , H are bounded by positive constant, ~  X   X  X  ~  X  1 ; ~  X  2 ; ... ; ~  X  p T , I  X  X  X   X   X  1 =  X  d  X  ;  X   X  X   X   X  1 =  X  c  X  ;  X   X   X  2 =  X  c  X  ; ... ;  X   X   X  p =  X  c  X   X   X   X  p =  X   X   X j  X   X  ^  X  and [(  X   X  j /  X  d )], [(  X   X  j /  X   X  X   X   X  j =  X  d  X  X  0 ; ... ; 0 |fflfflffl{zfflfflffl}  X  X   X   X  j =  X  c  X  X  0 ; ... ; 0 |fflfflffl{zfflfflffl}  X  X   X   X  j =  X   X   X  X  0 ; ... ; 0 |fflfflffl{zfflfflffl} respectively.

According to the above analysis and the designing of the proposed controller, the requirement for bounded uncertainties in our controlled robot system is relaxed.

This adv antageous feature can be used to conclude some internal boundedn ess properties of the controlled tiveness and robustness of the proposed method can be veri the following numerical simulat ion and experimental results. 4. Simulation and experimental results 4.1. Simulation results
To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we shall consider the mobile 2-DOF manipulator robot model as shown in Fig. 4 . The model of the mobile 2-DOF robot is described by the Lagrange Eq. (1) , and its dynamics are given as:  X   X  X   X  n ;  X  h T ;  X  n  X  X  X C ; Y C ;  X  T ;  X  h  X  X   X  1 ;  X  2 M C  X  C B  X  1 r G  X  000 T ; G h  X  00 : 5 gm 2 l 2 sin  X   X  2  X  where m m m c c n 13  X  X  m 1  X  m 2  X  d _  X  cos  X   X   X  ; c n 22  X  m 0  X  m 1  X  m c This mobile 2-DOF manipulators robot is subjected to non-holonomic constraints that is given as _
X C sin  X   X   X  X  _ Y C cos  X   X   X  X  0 _
X C cos  X   X   X  X  _ Y C cos  X   X   X  R _  X  r _  X  L  X  0 _ X C cos  X   X   X  X  _ Y C cos  X   X   X  X  R _  X  r _  X  R  X  0 So, the non-holonomic constraint matrix is described as A  X  X  sin  X   X   X  ; cos  X   X   X  ; 0 Vector o is de fi ned as o  X  [  X  L ,  X  R ] T and its derivation  X  (  X  n ) is determined as Z  X   X  n  X  X  And the detailed parameters of the 2-DOF mobile robot manip-ulators are given as: m 0  X  98(Kg), m 1  X  8(Kg), m 2  X  6(Kg), l l 2  X  1.2(m), r  X  0.18(m), R  X  0.25(m), I 1  X  1.2(Kg m 2 ), I I b  X  2(Kg m 2 ), I p  X  I b , d  X  0.35(m), g  X  9.8(m/s 2 ). effectiveness of the proposed scheme, the proportional-integral-and the FWNNs controller are examined in the meanwhile. The PIDC law can be expressed as:  X   X  K pc e  X  t  X  X  K ic gain matrices, respectively and they are designed by a compromise between the superiority of control performance and the magni-The detailed parameters of the proposed controllers are given as:  X   X  diag (10, 10, 20, 20), K r  X  diag (300, 300, 300, 300), K  X  diag (50), K d  X  K c  X  K  X   X  diag (20), b r  X  0.01,  X   X  0.001, K K of the proposed RFWNNs can be characterized by n  X  20, p  X  5, n  X  4 neurons at the input layer, the rule layer and the output layer, respectively. The controller-based FWNNs structure is con-sidered similar to the proposed controller structure (have no adding recurrent unit), so the detailed parameter of the FWNNs controller can be given as:  X  c  X  diag (100, 50, 20), K sc 150), s c  X  0.001, K ws  X  diag (50), K ds  X  K cs  X  diag (20), b  X   X  0.001, K  X  c  X  diag (0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001), n  X  20 p  X  10, n  X  4 neurons. We note that, all the gains of the controllers are chosen to achieve the best transient control performance in both the simulation and experimentation by considering the require-ment of stability and the possible operating conditions.
For recording respective control performance, the mean square error (MSE) of the position tracking response is de fi ned as: Based on this de fi nition, the normalized MSE (NMSE) value of is used to examine the control performance. The desired joint positions and non-holonomic force control of the 2-DOF mobile manipulators are de fi ned as: q d  X  4 t ; 4 : 5 t sin  X  2  X  t = 5  X  X  rad  X  ;  X  nd  X  10  X  N  X  .

To investigate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme, two simulation cases are considered: Case 1.  X  d  X  X  0 : 1 sin  X  2 t  X  ; 0 : 2 cos  X  2 t  X  ; 0 : cos  X  2 t  X  ; with no tip load.
 Case 2.  X  d  X  30  X  sin  X  20 t  X  ; cos  X  20 t  X  ; sin  X  20 t  X  term is also considered in the simulation: F  X  X  10 _ q 1  X  0 : 2 sign  X  _ q 1  X  ; 10 _ q 2  X  0 : 5 sign  X  time sample of the simulation process is 1 (ms).
 2001 ), FWNNs and the proposed scheme are depicted in Figs. 5 comparison NMSE values of each method are also presented in
Table 1 .In cases 1 and 2 , good tracking position can be obtained with the RFWNNs FWNNs, PIDC, and NNs. But the tracking errors of the proposed RFWNNs and FWNNs strategies converge faster than that of the NNs and PIDC methods. In addition, based on the
NMSE measures in Table 1 , the proposed RFWNNs strategy has position tracking improvements better than that of the FWNNs,
PIDC, and NNs schemes. Fig. 5 (i)-(m) (for case 1 ) and Fig. 6 (i) (for case 2 ) represent the torque control inputs of the RFWNNs,
FWNNs, FNNs, and the PIDC. In case 1 , the performances of control torque inputs of all the methods are good. In case 2 , while the proposed RFWNNs, the FWNNs and the FNNs strategy can show good torque input performance at the parameter variation condi-the PIDC torque input performance has occurred chattering phenomena. In the PIDC simulation, K pc , K ic , K dc are chosen according to Ziegler  X  Nichols tuning rules that based on the step response of the mobile manipulator control system. But the mobile manipulator robot is the complex model, so the selection for the in these fi gures are the best performance in terms of handling the heuristic process, but the chattering phenomena still exist when the frequency of the external disturbances increase or the load of manipulators is changed suddenly. In the NNs ( Lin and
Goldenberg, 2001 ) simulation, some control parameters, such as the constraint bounds of the tracking errors, the number nodes of the NNs, and the number of the fuzzy rules, are not easy to determine to achieve better performances.
 methods are presented in Figs. 5 (g) and 6 (g). The performance of the constraint force control depends on the performance of tracking position control. The designing for the constraint force in the NNs controller ( Lin and Goldenberg, 2001 ) is the same as the RFWNNs. But the designing for the constraint force in the PIDC scheme is different, one more PIDC for the constraint force is considered. In case 1 , the performance of the constraint force of the RFWNNs, FWNNs and the NNs is good, but the simulation proposed and FWNNs methods can show good constraint force performance at the parameter variation conditions, then the simulation results of the NNs and PIDC methods are not good, the undesired response appears when the time increases. The robust characteristic of the proposed RFWNNs and FWNNs con-trollers can be set with regard to the parameter variation and external disturbances.
 estimated parameters of the RFWNNs and FWNNs methods (for the outputs and estimation parameters (wavelet function) are good and they have proved the correctness of the proposed method including the boundedness of the control system para-meters. In case 2 , we can observe the approximation capability of the proposed method (the estimated and output parameters), as shown in Fig. 8 (c)  X  (f) is better than the FWNNs method under variation conditions. Based on the comparison simulations, the proposed RFWNNs controller is more suitable to be implemented to control the mobile manipulator robot under the occurrence of parameter variation, external disturbances. 4.2. Experimental results
In this part, we fi rst introduce the new style of the mobile type mobile manipulator robot shown in Fig. 9 . This is an autonomous robot with an on/of fl ine ability to work. It is researched and tested to deal with the cleaning condenser problems. The condenser is the vital equipment in various indus-trial areas, such as thermal power plants, nuclear power plants and other industrial plants. The condenser group is made by tens cold sources that can reduce the turbine exhaust temperature and exhaust turbine thermo-dynamic cycle steam pressure, to improve the cycle thermal ef fi ciency. Over operation-time, under the in fl uence of work environment, the condensers shall be affected even causes rusty of the condenser-pipes. Therefore, the style of the cleaning mobile robot manipulators is very necessary. The basic description of this practical mobile manipulator robot control system is also shown in Fig. 9 . Two links and the wheels are driven by four servo motors. The servo motors are controlled by the PCI control card though the power circuits (servo drive card). The PCI card is the universal card and it has full program-mable control and data acquisition ability. And the position sensors for the 4-positions of the mobile manipulator robot system are encoders. Signals from these encoders will pass to the C language to program on the PCI card through the CPU computer. The time sample for the real-time process is 1 (ms).
Some experimental results are provided here to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Two testing cases are implemented to verify the robustness of the controlled system. The fi rst case is considered with no-variation condition. The second case is considered with varying conditions at 8 s, i.e., adding more loads on the link 2 and mobile base. In addition, we also add more external disturbances, i.e., by increasing the friction forces between the joint connections (with the second case). The desired positions and the parameters of the controlled system are similar to the simulation part.

By analyzing the experimental process of the PIDC system, we performance is degenerated apparently. When the PIDC para-meters are selected properly, this phenomenon can be improved. But the control efforts become larger, so the stability of the controlled system can be not guaranteed. The PIDC is the useful method for industrial applications with its simple control struc-ture, ease of design. However, successful applications of these industrial models usually require manual parameters re-tuning PIDC parameters are chosen by our prior knowledge of the robot control system, so the performance of the tracking position and the control efforts is acceptable, and the stability of the mobile robot manipulator robot control system is still guaranteed. The experimental process of the NNs ( Lin and Goldenberg, 2001 ), FWNNs and the proposed control systems are implemented more favorable than PIDC system. But the determination for the RBF and initialized parameters of the NNs control system still need to pay more attention if we want to obtain better results.
 NNs ( Lin and Goldenberg, 2001 ), FWNNs, and the RFWNNs strategies, respectively. In the second case, Fig. 11 (a) and (b), tracking errors for the PIDC, NNs ( Lin and Goldenberg, 2001 ), FWNNs and the RFWNNs strategies, respectively. By comparing, be obtained with the RFWNNs, FWNNs, PIDC, and NNs methods, but the tracking errors of the proposed RFWNNs strategy converge faster than that of the FWNNs, NNs, and the PIDC methods. This improvement is also described by the comparison of the NMSE results in Table 2 . The results in Table 2 depend on the measure-ment devices and the programming method, so these results are not as good as the results in Table 1 . The robust term and estimating parameters of the wavelet function of the proposed method and FWNNs in the fi rst and second cases are depicted in Figs. 12 and 13 . Based on these results, the boundedness of the RFWNNs parameters is guaranteed. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed control system under the occurrence of the parameter variation can be clearly observed by comparing the performance of the tracking errors and control voltages presented in Figs. 9 and 10 . From both simulation and experimental results, we can realize that the control performance and robustness of the proposed controller-based RFWNNs under varying conditions are better than that of the FWNN, NNs, and PIDC strategies. 5. Conclusions
In this paper, the proposed RFWNNs control system has successfully implemented an adaptive position tracking control system and an adaptive force constraint control strategy for the non-holonomic mobile robot manipulators in the simulation and real-time practical operations. The RFWNNs have been applied in the main controller to approximate the dynamics of the robotic control system. Based on the advantages of the RFWNNs, the proposed control system has guaranteed the requirement for the high accuracy of the position tracking errors and non-holonomic constraint force-control under the varying conditions. In the RFWNNs control system, the information of the constrained/ assumption conditions, unknown dynamics, and uncertainties of the robotic system control are not required. In addition, all the adaptive online learning laws in the RFWNNs control system are stability of the closed-loop control system can be guaranteed whether or not the appearance of uncertainties. According to the comparison results of the simulation and experimental process, besides the stability and robustness features, the performance of the controlled system is vastly improved. The proposed RFWNNs mobile manipulator control system.
