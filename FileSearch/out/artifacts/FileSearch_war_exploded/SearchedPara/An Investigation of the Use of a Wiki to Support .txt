 This paper describes the use of a wiki to foster jo int learning among a group of non-profit, community-based organi zations involved with improving public health in London. Th e goal of the wiki was to encourage the growth of a community of practice X  clear patterns of mutual engagement, joint enterpri se and an emergent and shared repertoire of action X  X mong these organizations. Participants reported that they fail ed to contribute to the wiki largely for economic reasons, issues of identity, and a lack of group norms. A critical factor in its fail ure, however, was the lack of its integration into existing work prac tices and project governance.

Wikis; knowledge exchange; digital communities; com munities of practice; evaluation There has been increased interest in the UK in netw ork-based modes of organizing and learning in the public serv ices in general and in health care and public health in particular. A purported benefit of network-generated knowledge formation, f rom a policy perspective, is that it makes explicit tacit knowle dge that has been generated and tested in real, working settings, and that such knowledge has the potential to inform best practice among practitioners. Moreover, knowledge generation in n etworked settings is likely to be sustained because network sharing potentially supports communities of practice.

This paper describes the use of a wiki to foster jo int learning among a group of non-profit, community-based organi zations that promote community improvements in sexual health, me ntal health and end-of-life care for vulnerable populations in London. The goal of the wiki was to create intra-organizational histories of joint learning that would result in the collective identification of best practice. After the projects were established, the Health Fou ndation of London established a wiki and encouraged, but did n ot require, participants to use it to pose questions and to sha re experiences gained through practice in the field. Little was d one to integrate the project processes, and participants failed to u se the wiki at all. After six months, the wiki was abandoned. The goal of this paper is to identify socially-derived and constructed bar riers and exchange mechanisms to knowledge sharing across org anizational boundaries in electronic environments. This work was supported by a major health care foun dation in the UK, which we shall refer to as The Health Foundatio n. The Health Foundation makes grants and works collaborat ively with independent health agencies across London to critic ally examine what services they are delivering, the ways in whic h these services are being delivered, the capacities and competences needed to develop and deliver services, and the outcomes of d elivery. It encourages its grantees to engage in reflective pra ctice, to apply what they learn in order to understand the effects of their work practice, and to share experience and lessons learn ed through their field work with others. To this end, The Health Fo undation encourages grantees to collect and evaluate data an d to construct theory that can be used by the Foundation and the g rantees themselves to build a body of knowledge of what wor ks, for whom, and under what circumstances or contexts. [21 ] There were twelve projects funded for three years c oncerned with improving the sexual health, mental health or end o f life care of Londoners, particularly those in vulnerable populat ions, such as the poor, the aged, the homeless, members of new im migrant communities or any combination of these. The proje cts investigate practical methods of improving services and evaluating the effects of those improvements. The field work itself takes place in complex environments; project s often have to coordinate a range of existing social and health se rvices X  X uch as existing hospitals, physicians, housing agencies, w elfare agencies, and community-based organizations (such as small bu sinesses and local churches). Moreover, there are often cultura l dimensions, particularly in immigrant populations, that require delicate negotiation. The funded agency, then, is faced wit h the complex task of gaining entry, building trust with clients, building working relationships between clients and hardened bureaucr atic social services, and coming to understand the effects of t heir work practice. That is, they are both attempting to ef fect systemic change, as well as understanding and evaluating the effects of their work. [19] Because of the complexity of the work, and the skil ls needed to carry it through, The Health Foundation believed th at the social generation of knowledge through a process of networ ked knowledge exchange was a promising approach to crea ting shared understanding, peer-led changes in work practice, a nd the identification of best or promising practices based on shared experience. This belief was influenced not only by the recent interest in networked knowledge in policy circles, but also by more fundamental studies in shared cognition and le arning. [13] The Foundation wanted to capture and share tacit kn owledge derived through work practice, not formal knowledge in the form of reports that are commonly written by funded agen cies to their sponsoring organizations. Such reports often tally -up cases served by the agency; nothing is mentioned about th e process of work, and how that process can be changed to better serve the needs of clients. [10] Instead, the Foundation is p articularly interested in understanding practice, as Brown and Duguid argue, close  X  X o the point at which working life is lived, [and] work done X  [6] because such knowledge affords an underst anding of what works, for whom, and under what conditions. Put another way, if we were studying the scientific community, we would be interested in looking at laboratory work and the ta cit or  X  X rivate X  knowledge that grows as a result of bench processes . Such knowledge sheds light on the practice of science th at is hidden in formal research papers that report results. [16] [1 7] Such private knowledge is both situated and has a community-base d set of meanings that influence an individual X  X  relationshi p and identity with the group. [9] An important factor that influences sharing behavio r is the perceived competence of a contributor to group lear ning. That is, to be accepted into the group is to be seen by the group to be competent in what you do [15], and to be seen as capable of participating with others in a web of relationships . [8] Therefore, knowledge and its exchange cannot be separated from the emergent social relations that it influences, where individuals are mutually constraining and susceptible. [14] [20] [5 ] Knowledge sharing behavior thus is strongly connected with id entity that itself is shaped by social relations. [5] In a networked environment, however, identity is, a t best, only partially under the control of the participant. Te xts contributed to a wiki by participants can be constructed and decon structed by community members in ways that are beyond control o f participants, and can be used by others to generate multiple identities or as a means of exercising power and co ntrol [15] [7] that have the potential not only to keep a member f rom participating fully in the group, but can also have , in some situations, real, tangible and lasting economic con sequences for the participant or the group represented by the par ticipant. This is especially true when participants cannot predict th e behaviour of group members, or when there are perceived asymmetr ical power relationships among participants in the network. For example, on the one hand having your own data a nd fresh insights is often seen as a status marker; on the o ther, there is a stigma attached to those in that community that con sume, rather than produce, new knowledge or techniques. [5] Stu dies in science have demonstrated, for example, that bench knowledge that is not fully verified is often not shared with others if the data can be misinterpreted because such a misinterpretat ion may have a damaging effect of the creator X  X  reputation. From an economic standpoint, being in possession of new techniques o r knowledge gives one an edge over a competitor which is not ea sily simply given away. This competitive edge is well known in commercial setting, but studies in the sociology of science id entify the intrinsic value that lab techniques and know-how ha ve in scientific research labs, especially those in compe tition with each other. [17] [18] [12] [11] Non-profits, too, are in competition with each othe r for funding, and potentially are not likely either to share info rmation that may adversely affect their own identities or reputation s, or which will give a difficult-to-gain insight to a competing org anization. [10] Non-profits, as we have seen, often work in environ ments that are complex and where task uncertainty is high. Some r esearch has suggested that the higher the task uncertainty, the higher the value placed on the resulting knowledge by researchers an d practitioners. [5] The higher the value of knowled ge, the less likely it will be shared without some equitable for m of reciprocity. [3] The author attended and kept field notes of thirty-two meetings between the Foundation and each of its funded partn ers over an consecutive eight-month period in 2006 and 2007 tha t discussed progress, barriers, and what was learned from the o ngoing work. The meetings surfaced a set of common problems acro ss the projects (such as establishing trust, coordinating and maintaining the commitment of multiple social service agencies) . While the Foundation saw commonalities across the projects, e ach research site was isolated and unaware of the practices and problems faced by the others. The Foundation therefore establishe d a wiki, after the projects were started, so that participants cou ld share experience in real time that might inform practice across the sites. Entries to the wiki by the Foundation, the only par ticipant willing to use it, were collected by the author. At the end of the six month wiki trial, the partici pants were brought together at the Foundation for a day-long w orkshop to discuss what they considered to be the barriers to knowledge exchange in the wiki. Participants reported in bot h plenary sessions and in small workshops composed of six to eight members. Forty representatives from all funded pro jects participated in the workshop. Notes from the works hop as well as the thirty-two meetings were transcribed and groupe d into themes based on content. The participants suggest that economic consideratio ns play a dominant role in hindering knowledge exchange, and the need for learning how to exchange knowledge in electronic settings. The responses from this group also suggest that issues of identity are intertwined with the economics of knowledge exchang e. The results suggest that the wiki made manifest existin g work habits that hinder knowledge sharing. The economics of sharing knowledge fell into two ca tegories: The costs of sharing knowledge; and, The impacts or pay offs of sharing knowledge. With respect to costs, most par ticipants argued that it takes time to compose a wiki entry a nd to read the entries of others. Field workers in particular iden tified time as the most precious resource that they control. If they were going to compose a wiki entry, they want a tangible benefit from it X  X nd many asserted that they could not see the tangible results. A common refrain was,  X  X riting something takes a lot of time, and I can X  X  see the benefit of this for me. X  Indeed, man y did not want to use a wiki (or a blog) to find an answer to a quest ion because, as one put it,  X  X ou X  X e confronted by threads that you trip over and which may, or may not, answer your question. I don  X  X  have the time for that. X  Some considered that cost of the time they spend wr iting an entry, and the payoff, both economic and for the formation and reinforcement of identity. The payoff did not rela te to the exchange of knowledge or the acquisition of new ski lls and insight, but to increased personal and organization al reputation among the professional medical and health communiti es. For example, a representative comment from a medical pr actitioner was,  X  X f I spend time writing, I have to consider m y audience and the impact. My audience is doctors. If I write, I need to write for doctors because that X  X  what gets me my kudos. X  Mor eover, there was a concern that taking the time to write should push forward the importance of the work with policy makers. A r epresentative comment from a manager in this regard was,  X  X  X  X  con cerned with advocacy, so anything I write has to put advocacy o n the map. I have to be careful about what I say and how I say i t, or we won X  X  be taken seriously. X  This respondent did not see t he value in gaining experiential knowledge or insights from oth er practitioners, nor in sharing with peers X  X nstead, th e payoff was in gaining the approval of  X  X eople who matter, X  not ably funders and policy makers. Finally, respondents carefully considered the impli cations that sharing knowledge would have on future funding. At issue were (a) what you shared and (b) how much you shared. F or many, this was a lose-lose wager. For example, if you exchang ed knowledge of the practices that did not have the intended eff ect so that others could avoid making the same mistake, there was a pa lpable fear that you would be perceived as incompetent by both your peer group as well as potential future funders; if you s hared too little, then the peer group would perceive you as simply co nsuming knowledge or hoarding what you know. Knowing just what to share when the power relationships among participan ts was asymmetrical (keep in mind that the Foundation was to contribute to the wiki) was seen to be fraught with uncertaint y of its effects. A representative comment was,  X  X f we don X  X  get fund ed again, we may think  X  X t must have been something we said or h aven X  X  said. X  Sharing knowledge does not come naturally; it is a learned behavior. [22] There was marked concern among parti cipants with knowing when to share and what to share. Participa nts did not know if their work would be relevant and useful to the group at large, and they feared that they may waste the time of the other participants. This view was held apart from a conc ern with identity X  X he issue was not a fear of appearing incom petent to the group, but a general unfamiliarity with knowing if the information they held would be relevant to the group. For exam ple, a representative question was,  X  X ow do we know what t o say that X  X  important? X  There was widespread support for the n otion that group norms on notification and the identification of  X  X mportant findings X  needed to be developed before they were i ntroduced to the wiki. The evidence from the participants suggests that th e major barrier in exchanging knowledge across organizations in thi s group under study was the perceived economic impact on the one hand, and the lack of norms and accepted group behaviour on t he other. There was a general consensus that the resource cos t to contribute to the wiki was not offset by any real, tangible be nefit; that the resources can be used to better effect is they were directed at those who could control future funding and resources; and , finally, that contributions may be used in the future against fun ding decisions. We saw that issues of identity, particularly around the areas of the group perception of competence, were also an import ant factor the militated against the exchange of experiential and tacit knowledge. Finally, the respondents indicated that they had little guidance on what the group believed was  X  X mportant X  and  X  X elevant X  information to share. But these factors in themselves did not cause the w iki to fail. Instead, the wiki was established by the Foundation after the projects had begun, and it existed alongside of, an d not integrated with, existing work practices, habits, and cognitiv e orientations. Each project is conducted by an agency that has lon g experience in the fields of sexual health, mental health and a dvocacy. They have well-established internal norms, values, and h abits of working. All of them are supported by foundations and government grants and contracts, and they have esta blished skills and procedures for obtaining funding for present an d future projects. The Foundation requested that these orga nizations share internal knowledge externally, something that these organizations had never done before. There was nothing in their habitual work practices that supported knowledge sharing, and not hing in knowledge sharing that was perceived to enhance the ir practice. This perception was reinforced because the Foundati on, which funded the groups, initiated and participated in th e wiki, and the Foundation did not provide tools and guidance that would not only support participation, but also engender trust . There was also a perceived asymmetrical relationship between the Foundation and the organizations it funded. Its in itial wiki postings asked the participants to  X  X ake sense X  of their work, which the participants interpreted as a form of mon itoring. Because participation was voluntary, they decided t o ignore the wiki rather than take a risk by contributing raw wo rk in progress that a funding agency could judge. One could argue that the simple establishment of a wiki could not, in itself, overcome pre-existing structures that hi nder knowledge exchange. Indeed, building on Bourdieu X  X  concept o f habitus, Carlile argues that knowledge is localized, embedde d and invested in local practice, and this makes sharing knowledge across organizational boundaries especially difficult. [7] This case surfaces some design considerations that focus on the social organization and management of a group in an electronic environment that is intended to exchange knowledge. What is needed is a social scaffold and the generation of e xplicit group norms and trust to encourage knowledge exchange tha t include the support of social interaction around emergent d iscoveries. [5] This would best be done by integrating the wiki int o day-to-day work practice of the joint projects rather than as a perceived add-on to existing work at the local level. Moreover, as a funder that exerts power over the participants, the Foundation could not expect that participants would exchange knowledge X  X n cluding mistakes and paths not taken that are so critical t o experiential learning X  X n the wiki in an unconstrained way. This case illustrates that without embedding the wi ki into daily work and project governance, the Foundation unwitti ngly designed a process that made manifest behavioral ba rriers to sharing knowledge across organizational boundaries.
