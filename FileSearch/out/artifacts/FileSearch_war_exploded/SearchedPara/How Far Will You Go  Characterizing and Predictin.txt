 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval---search process Information scent, need for cognition, search stopping behavior Predicting when online searchers terminate search for information tasks without obvious end-points is a challenging task. Previous research concludes that people stop based on intuitions of enough [4], yet few studies have systematically examined online search stopping behavior. For open-ended s earch tasks, searchers often have to reformulate their queries in order to obtain a sufficient amount of information, which m eans that before searchers quit searching for a task entirely (stopping at the task level), they also stop result evaluation for different queries during the search (stopping at the query level). When searchers stop evaluating results at the query level and the task level can potentially be explained by the theory of information scent [3]. Previous work shows that searchers decide which links to follow based on different information scents, such as anchor text and snippet. When making a decision about whether to reformulate, the first search engine results page (SERP) can be viewed as the information scent of all returned results; searchers may predict th e potential value of the set of search results based on the char acteristics of the initial SERP. Card et al. [2] found that the in formation scent of the homepage of a site is positively correlated with how long a searcher stayed on the site. By the same analogy, the information scent level of the first SERP can possibly predic t how long a searcher will stay on a set of search results. When more relevant search results are present, it is likely to give the impression that more relevant results can be found beyond the first SERP; searchers are therefore more likely to continue searching. Furthermore, Card et al. [2] has also found that as searchers navigated a series of Webpages within a Website, when the information scent declined, searchers tended to leave the Website. This result also seems to suggest that the information scent distribution matters . Specifically, when the information scent pattern is persistent instead of discontinued on the first SERP, searchers may be more inclined to continue exploring the current search result set. Similarly, when making a decision about when to stop searching for a task, the first SERP one encounters may indicate how difficult it will be to retrieve useful information, which might subsequently influence how persis tent searchers are with a task. Variations in when a person deci des to stop searching might also be caused by individual differe nces. While some people avoid expending cognitive effort when searching, others have a greater desire to be thorough. Such an individual difference in tendency to engage in effortful cognitive activities can be explained by a personality trait: Need for Cognition [1]. Research has shown that NFC has a positive relationship with the amount of cognitive effort put to a task. In the context of online searching which is often a cognitive demanding activity, NFC can potentially be useful for explaining why certain searchers stop early than others. Two mixed-factorial laboratory experiments are proposed to examine (1) whether there is an effect of information scent level, manipulated by placing different numbers of relevant search results on the first SERP (one, th ree, five, and seven documents), and (2) whether there is an effect of information scent pattern, manipulated by changing the ranking of four relevant search results (Four levels: persistent, disrupted, bursting, and delayed), on search stopping behavior at both the query and the task level. In both studies, whether the pers onality trait, NFC (Two levels: High vs. Low), has an effect on search stopping behavior, and whether it moderates the effect of information scent level and pattern on search stopping behavior will also be investigated. The findings of the studies are expected to help with the generation of models of search stopping behavior and informing system designs that encourage more thorough search result evaluation and prevent premature search stopping.
