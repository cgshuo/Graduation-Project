Domesticating Information: Managing Documents Inside the Organization, Carol E.B. Choksy. Scarecrow Press (2006). 250 pp., $40.00, ISBN: 0-8108-5190-3
Carol E.B. Choksy X  X  book, Domesticating Information , is built around a central theme:  X  X  X hat humanity has done with information is to learn to catch it and use it, just as we learned to catch horses, dogs, and wild grain and use them. Information evolved with our understanding of it, just as horses, dogs, and grain have evolved. Just as we domesticated animals and plants, we domesticated information X  X  (p. xiii). Choksy uses the metaphor of  X  X  X omesticating information X  X  to reassert a unique professional role for the records manager.
The book begins by tracing the history of records management from ancient times to the present. Choksy links records management with general developments in the field of business management, particularly  X  X  X cientific management X  X  at the beginning of the twentieth century. By the end of the century, however, records management was no longer perceived as cutting edge. Rather, records management became associated primar-ily with the storage of inactive records at the end of the information lifecycle  X  a far cry from herding wild information central to business activity.

Chapter two discusses the  X  X  X ontext of records X  X . It is common to talk about a record as being composed of more than just  X  X  X ontent X  X :  X  X  X ontext X  X  (and sometimes  X  X  X tructure X  X ) are added to the contemporary definition of record. In Choksy X  X  words, the role of context is  X  X  X o ensure  X  X holeness X  despite the disruptions of technology X  X  (p. 47). This is a far-reaching chapter that moves from the meaning of a  X  X  X ign X  X , through the challenges of maintaining context in the digital environment, to the limitations of document management software products. Choksy is particularly critical of the latter, decrying the whole idea of  X  X  X eclaring X  X  certain documents to be  X  X  X ecords X  X . In Choksy X  X  view, this false distinction has caused many organizations to have major problems with litigation discovery requests.

Chapter three continues the discussion of the definition of a record. Choksy takes issue with much of the recent research about digital records by archivists. In particular, she believes that archival research about  X  X  X eliability and authenticity X  X  relates to artifacts removed from their business environments for preservation and research. In her view, this research has little usefulness for the records manager who must focus on stan-dards for authenticity and admissibility established by the legal sector and the creating organizations themselves. Choksy X  X  analysis is thought provoking, even for those like myself who believe that she has thrown out the baby with the bath water in the area of authenticity.

After dismissing much of the recent archival literature, in chapter four Choksy presents her view of the relationship between documents and records. This is an excellent chapter, especially for professionals who are struggling with managing digital documents and records. Choksy identifies four types of records: single records (discrete, individual units created from single electronic files); simplex records (individual units created from databases); dynamic, compound records (represented as single units created from several electronic files or databases); and static, compound records (single units created from several single electronic files and databases, but ever-growing until closure).

In chapter five, Choksy turns to the life cycle of records and its relationship to business processes. In Chok-sy X  X  words,  X  X  X he concept of the records life cycle is one of the most important within records management, as it is the perspective that yields the greatest benefit to the organization. It is the perspective of management X  X  (pp. 113 X 114). She defines seven phases of the life cycle: (1) information management planning; (2) creation, receipt, and capture; (3) organization; (4) use and dissemination; (5) maintenance, protection, and preservation; (6) retirement; and (7) disposition. This chapter provides many useful ideas but does so with a jarring shift in tone.
Previous chapters combined theory with practice, offering insights from a variety of disciplines including lin-guistics and philosophy. Chapter five suddenly becomes very practical, much more in keeping with previous re-cords management books. The reader is left with the impression of two separate books with very different styles.
Chapter six continues the practical approach by discussing how we add value to records by organizing them. There is a particularly strong section on classification principles and practices. Classification has become increasingly important as records managers interact with document management and content management systems.

The book ends with a short chapter on  X  X  X ew requirements for records managers X  X . Choksy discusses knowl-edge of: information technology, litigation and discovery issues, security and privacy, business processes, managing change, and communicating with individuals at all levels within the organization. The most basic requirement, however, is that records managers return to a position of professional leadership. In Choksy X  X  words:  X  X  X e must now lead ourselves into managing records. We must stop following the archivists and librar-ians. Why we have followed the utterances of a few archivists as if they were our gurus and worshipped at the altar of library science is unclear. They do not manage business information; they manage cultural informa-tion X  X  (p. 202). It is the records manager who must domesticate the free-range information within the organization.

In conclusion, Carol E.B. Choksy has written an insightful and provocative book. Readers (and reviewers) may disagree with some of what she wrote, but we all will leave with a new appreciation for the complex role of the records manager in the decades ahead.

Myatt, G.J. (2007). Making sense of data: a practical guide to exploratory data analysis and data mining (pp. 280). Wiley
Making Sense of Data by Glenn Myatt is quick over of data analysis technique (i.e., I finished the book on the flight from Dulles to O X  X ara). The book takes an interesting approach to understanding data. From the title, I thought the paradigm was going to be an information science viewpoint to data (e.g., the inductive model of data, information, knowledge, and insight). Instead, the book took a statistical approach to making sense of data. However, the author wrapped these standard statistical approaches in a project manage frame-work: thereby achieving the same data, information, knowledge, and insight end. This approach combined with the project management statistical framework was interesting, where one could see the relationship, although the connections between the two paradigms were not thoroughly made throughout the book.

Chapter 1 provides an overview of the book, specifically a four-step process of any exploratory analysis/ data mining project, with the four steps being: (1) problem definition, (2) data preparation, (3) implementation of the analysis, and (4) deployment of the results. The author correctly points out that there will be some over-lap among the four steps. The problem definition is given short rift, only a paragraph. This was the same for data preparation. Implementation of the analysis (i.e., decision making) is presented as one of three categories: (1) summarizing the data, (2) finding hidden relationships, and (3) making predictions. Again there is a great deal of interplay among the three. The author does a great job of illustrating this in Fig. 1.2 (page 4), where the overlap of the three categories and several common methods of statistical analysis and data mining are pre-sented in a Venn diagram. A brief mention of the deployment of the results ends the chapter.

Chapter 2 focuses on problem definition, with coverage of defining the objectives and deliverables. There is also a brief and out of place mention of project roles and project plans. Either is presented in any practical detail. This chapter, as with most of the chapters, ends with a case study and suggestions for further reading, which are actually quite good.

Chapter 3 deals with data preparation, which are an often over looked aspect of data analysis, but which is critical to the confidence with which future decision or implications from findings can be made. This chapter is presented from a database point of view, although there are certainly non-database data that one could ad-dress. For me, the most interesting aspect of this chapter was the data transformation methods.
