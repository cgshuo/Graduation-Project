 We present the information extraction system Text2SemRel . The system (semi-) automatically constructs knowledge bases from tex-tual data consisting of facts about entities using semantic relations. An integral part of the system is a graph-based interactive visu-alization and search layer. The second contribution in this paper is the presentation of a case study on the (semi-)automatic con-struction of a knowledge base consisting of gene-disease associa-tions. The resulting knowledge base, the L iterature-derived H uman G ene-D isease N etwork (LHGDN), is now an integral part of the Linked Life Data initiative and represents currently the largest pub-licly available gene-disease repository. The LHGDN is compared against several curated state of the art databases. A unique feature of the LHGDN is that the semantics of the associations constitute a wide variety of biomolecular conditions.
 H.4 [ Information Systems Applications ]: Miscellaneous Management, Design, Experimentation
As of December 2009, there are 5414 1 journals indexed in the world X  X  largest biomedical database PubMed. From the year 2000 to 2008 the number of articles stored in PubMed almost doubled. With each new published article, a cohort of new facts is introduced to the public. This immense growth of literature in the biomedical domain calls for automatic methods to extract these myriads of po-tential new findings and make this information available for search and analysis. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/num_titles.html
A particularly important piece of biomedical knowledge con-cerns genes and their association with diseases. Our knowledge about the possible genetic causes of complex diseases is still lim-ited and for many diseases there are still no proper cures. Through-out this paper, we refer to disease genes as genes that are either involved in the causation of a disease or are associated with a dis-ease [8]. One problem is that individual researchers are only fa-miliar with a small portion of the available published knowledge and don X  X  overview the literature as a whole. This phenomenon is also known as the problem of knowledge pockets [7]. As a con-crete example, several gene-disease association repositories do ex-ist on the web and they all have a special focus and thus are highly focused and non-redundant. However, many diseases are caused by the effect of several genes and thus a unified view on human gene-disease associations will help to improve the understanding of complex diseases tremendously. A particular problem is that the various databases use different controlled vocabularies, which are tailored to their specific purposes. As a consequence, data integra-tion issues are another major challenge.

Information Extraction (IE) techniques can help to alleviate the situation. Given that all or at least most of the knowledge is some-where available in textual form and can thus, in principle be ex-tracted, IE approaches have a compelling property: they can alle-viate the data integration problem by using consistent controlled vocabularies in advance and search subsequently through all avail-able unstructured data sources.
In this paper we present Text2SemRel , which (semi-)automatically constructs knowledge bases of entities and relations extracted from textual data. Extracted facts can be converted into a canonical form provided that controlled vocabularies of entities are available. From a semantic web perspective, the system populates an ontology of interest. Text2SemRel extends the relation extraction (RE) system published in [6] with an interactive visualization and search layer (see Figure 1). The system supports interactive exploration with simple keyword search over the structured knowledge base. Thus, we combine information extraction, graph-based visualization and simple keyword search into one single framework.

The second main contribution is the presentation of a case study on applying Text2SemRel to a large biomedical textual repository to extract semantic gene-disease associations.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 intro-duces the proposed system. The LHGDN is described in more de-Figure 1: Text2SemRel framework. The system consists of four main layers: the pre-processing layer, the learning layer, the extraction layer and the data-storage &amp; representation layer. The dotted lines indicate optional steps. tail in Section 3. Before concluding in Section 5, we briefly high-light related work in Section 4.

As can be seen from Figure 1, Text2SemRel consists of four main layers. The first three layers are based on the relation extraction framework presented in [6]. www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~bundschu
Once a knowledge base consisting of triples has been constructed with Text2SemRel , the question arises of how it can be accessed. Besides common filtering functions over the knowledge base such as filtering for specific entities and relations, Text2SemRel comes with an easy to use, graph-based visualization framework. The sys-tem supports interactive exploration with simple keyword search over the Entity-Relationship (ER) graph. Thus, we use a combi-nation of paradigms originating from two different communities to access knowledge bases derived from text: (i) graph-based visu-alization and (ii) keyword search over structured data. The inno-vative combination of the just mentioned paradigms for informa-tion access in Text2SemRel makes extracted knowledge bases easily searchable.

The underlying data structure of Text2SemRel is an ER graph, consisting of entities such as genes, drugs, diseases etc . and of rela-tions concerning the entities. Thus, visualizing the knowledge base as a graph is intuitive and enables the user to get a fast overview. E. g. , as a benefit of the graph-based visualization it can be eas-ily seen which entities are the most connected ones (the hubs) in the ER-graph. Moreover, it can easily be seen which parts of the knowledge base are disconnected. All these things make the graph-based visualization a helpful feature for knowledge discovery. This second component for simplifying information access in Text2SemRel is motivated by the attempt to make relational database management systems (RDBMS) as easily searchable as keyword-based search engines (see e. g. [1]). A common criticism of for-mal query languages is that it is hard and uncomfortable for end-users to pose queries. Furthermore, despite the recent advances in the IE domain, it will not always be possible to convert all rele-vant information into a structured form. One reason for this is that the assessment of relevance regarding information is highly sub-jective and varies from end-user to end-user. Therefore, methods are needed that are able to extract the most important facts (semi-) automatically, but at the same time are able to further narrow down the desired context. Text2SemRel makes use of the plain text col-lections from which the facts are extracted and annotates the facts with words originating from these sources. Put in other words, a fact is treated as a bag-of-words vector consisting of all words oc-curring from the various source documents from which the fact was extracted. In this way, we can additionally filter facts according to Boolean keyword queries and thus provide additional powerful fil-tering capabilities, without the need to extract further entities and relations. Thus, the keyword-search component over the structured ER-graph will help to satisfy the manifold end-user needs.
The starting point of the visualization is the complete knowledge base. A user has the following options to search for specific facts: The information access layer in our system employs Cytoscape which is a network visualization tool well established in the biomed-ical community. Furthermore, the Boolean keyword query lan-guage is implemented with the ESP, that uses the Lucene retrieval library 3 for indexing. Note that a complex retrieval example is de-scribed in the longer technical report 2 .
Text2SemRel was trained on an in-house generated training cor-pus (see [6] for more information). In contrast to the gene-disease associations provided by the curated state of the art databases, gene-disease associations in the LHGDN are classified into several biomolec-ular conditions. These conditions are describing a wide variety of molecular events, ranging from genetic to transcriptional and phos-phorylation events. In particular, we defined the following condi-tions that can hold between genes and diseases: altered expression, genetic variation, regulatory modification, any relation and nega-tive associations . It was shown in former experiments that the sys-tem is able to extract the just described gene-disease associations with a F-measure of 78% (NER+SRE) (see [6]). http://www.cytoscape.org/features2.php http://www.lucene.apache.org/ Figure 3: Number of genes, diseases and edges in the databases under consideration.  X  X dges simplified X  represent unique gene-disease associations, while  X  X dges multiple X  denotes that an association is counted every time it is mentioned in a database.

Text2SemRel was applied to the whole Entrez Gene X  X  4 GeneRIF (Gene Reference Into Function) database. The GeneRIF database represents a rapidly growing knowledge repository and consists of high-quality phrases created or reviewed by Medical Subject Head-ing (MeSH) indexers. Hereby, the phrases refer to a particular gene in the Entrez Gene database and describe its function in a concise phrase. The LHGDN was created based on a GeneRIF version from March 31st, 2009, consisting of 414241 phrases. These phrases were further restricted to the organism Homo Sapiens, which re-sulted in a total of 178004 phrases. In the GeneRIF database the genes are already given in advance and thus the relation extraction problem converts to (i) identifying disease mentions and (ii) de-ciding which relation holds between the given key entity (here a gene) and the other entities in the sentence. Due to the particular structure of the GeneRIF database, the gene normalization is trivial, which otherwise is in itself a serious research problem (see e. g. the BioCreAtIvE 5 evaluations). The identified disease mentions were normalized with a simple sliding-window heuristic to Bio2RDF URI X  X .

Figure 3 compares the size of the LHGDN with several other state of the art databases 7 8 9 10 . CURATED represents a current in-tegration effort of several manually curated databases [4]. It can be easily seen, that a tremendous amount of knowledge about gene-disease associations is currently locked in the literature. Besides this, the LHGDN was compared to the curated databases with re-spect to biological properties of the genes, in particular pathway and GO (Gene Ontology) homogeneity. Furthermore, we investi-gated carefully the distribution of gene, disease and fact mentions in the LHGDN. It turns out that all three empirical quantities in the current version of the LHGDN follow a power-law distribu-tion. This gives interesting insights in the underlying processes of how facts centered around gene-disease associations are published. Please refer to the technical report for a detailed description of the results 2 . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene http://www.biocreative.sourceforge.net http://www.bio2rdf.org http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim http://www.uniprot.org/ http://www.pharmgkb.org/ http://ctd.mdibl.org/ [9] provides a recent survey over the broad field of IE and aligns existing work with several dimensions. Text2SemRel treats the task of Semantic Relation Extraction as sequence labeling task. Most similar to our approach in the algorithmic sense is the TextRunner system [3]. However, TextRunner aims at Open Information Ex-traction, a very ambitious, relation-independent extraction paradigm. Thus, the system may not yield high precision at reasonable recall when compared to traditional RE frameworks [3]. Another system using CRF-based technology for extracting relations is the Kylin system for generating Wikipedia infoboxes [10].
With Text2SemRel we introduced a framework that is able to ex-tract facts from textual resources and thus contributes to reduce the gap between text and knowledge. Text2SemRel allows expressive search and interactive exploration over the extracted knowledge base and thus facilitates knowledge discovery. As a result from applying Text2SemRel to a large biomedical text collection, we pre-sented the LHGDN, which currently is the largest gene-disease as-sociation repository publicly available. The LHGDN is an integral part of the Linked Life Data 11 initiative, which confirms the high quality of facts extracted with our presented system. Last but not least, we investigated how entity and fact mentions are distributed in the LHGDN. A careful statistical analysis of the current snapshot of the LHGDN reveals that the number of entity and fact mentions follows a power law distribution. [1] Agrawal et al.
