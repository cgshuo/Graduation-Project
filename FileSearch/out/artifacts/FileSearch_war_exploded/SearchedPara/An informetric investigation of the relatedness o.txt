 1. Introduction
The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that 40 million people are currently living with HIV/AIDS and that 92.5% of them are adults while the rest are children below the age of 15 years ( UNAIDS, 2003 ). The report further shows that during the year 2003, approximately 5 mil-lion people were infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Within the same period, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) claimed 3 million lives.

Although it has elicited controversial observations concerning its cause, AIDS is generally believed to be the final stage of HIV infection. At its initial stage, HIV dramatically reduces the CD4+ T-cells, which are  X  X  X entral elements in the control of both humoral and cell mediated immune defenses X  X  ( Brookmeyer &amp; Gail, 1994, p. 8 ). The third and last stage of the battle between HIV and the body  X  s immune system, called clinical
AIDS stage, begins with the decline of the total CD4+ T-cell count to approximately 200 per cubic milli-meter of blood ( World Bank, 1997 ).

This stage takes a few years after which the virus weakens the immune system to the point where the first  X  X  X pportunistic infections X  X  (OIs) manifest themselves. A further decline of these cells causes the body to easily succumb to the OIs and other illnesses, a situation that leads to death. Medical researchers have observed that HIV itself does not kill but, instead, it is the OIs that kill ( Me  X  decins Sans Frontie ` res, 2003 ). Williams (1991, p. 34) , for instance, observes that  X  X  X here is very rarely an African who dies from
AIDS or HIV diseases without a minimum of two opportunistic infections, established either on clinical grounds or confirmed at autopsy X  X .

OIs are illnesses that make one sick due to the damaged or weakened immune system of the body caused by the HIV infection ( Sowadsky, 1999; UNAIDS, 1998 ). They are caused by microbes such as viruses or bacteria that, under normal circumstances, do not make healthy people sick ( National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), 2003; West Penn Allegheny Health System for Patients and Public
Health, 2003 ). Their association and/or relatedness to HIV/AIDS has been medically documented. In fact, it has been observed that some of these diseases are more common in persons with HIV/AIDS while others are less common ( Cheesbrough, 2000; Me  X  decins Sans Frontie ` res, 2003; New Mexico AIDS Education &amp; Training Center, 2003 ).

Whether this kind of association is reflected in the published literature on HIV/AIDS is the subject of this study. Secondly, this study examines the applicability of co-word analysis to evaluate the strength of asso-ciation between OIs and HIV/AIDS. In other words, the study aims at assessing whether co-word analysis can be utilized to supplement other medical research methods, such as clinical surveys, in determining the relatedness of OIs and HIV/AIDS, on the one hand, and a disease and its associated pathogens, on the other. 2. An overview of co-word analysis
The origin and development of the concept of co-word analysis has been attributed to the increasing growth of information, which poses problems to scientists and policy makers. In the words of He (1999) ,  X  X  X t is hard for scientists to detect the subject areas and the linkages among these areas in their research fields, and policy makers have difficulties in mapping the dynamics of science to do research planning X  X . Secondly, the mapping of relationships among concepts, ideas, and problems in science called for the development of better quantitative analytic techniques, which currently include co-citation analysis, co-nomination analysis, co-classification, and co-word analysis ( He, 1999; Kostoff, 2001 ).
Co-word analysis, sometimes referred to as co-occurrence analysis, has emerged as an essential biblio-metric analytic tool in the assessment of the strength of association between two or more terms. It simply refers to the process of analysing the  X  X  X o-occurrence of two or more words in one document or in different documents X  X  ( Diodato, 1994, 54 ). Krsul (2002) defines it as  X  X  X  content analysis technique that is effective in mapping the strength of association between keywords in textual data X  X . The technique focuses on analysis of term(s) within the text or keywords.

The origin of the co-word analysis method can be traced way back to the 1980  X  s when French sociolo-gists, from the school  X  X  X cole des Mines X  X , set out to examine the  X  X  X ole of words and networks of words in literal texts describing evolving systems X  X  ( Shyama &amp; de Looze, 2001 ). In due course, they developed a methodology that was close to co-citation analysis, a method that was developed by the Institute for Sci-entific Information (ISI) and made possible through the creation of the Science Citation Index (SCI) by
Eugene Garfield in 1964 in the USA. Shyama and de Looze (2001) observe that co-word analysis, as devel-oped in France, was different from co-citation analysis in that it was applied to the words themselves in the literal text and not only to authors . Co-word analysis has since been developed by different authors to incor-porate several approaches. It involves the preparation of an Inclusion Index, Proximity Index and the cal-culation of the Equivalence Coefficient ( He, 1999 ). The application and importance of the method in mapping the content of research has been boosted with the development of co-word analysis tools such as Bibexcel and the analytic tool developed by Krsul, which is available at: http://www.acis.ufl.edu/ ~ivan/coword/ (Last accessed on Dec., 3rd 2003).

Several studies, with varying aims and objectives, have been conducted in a variety of disciplines using co-word analysis. The method has been used to identify knowledge communities in various sectors in public policy development ( Neil, 2002 ) and to find out the most frequent topics in Library and Information Sci-ence (LIS) research ( Uzun, 2002 ). It has also been used to trace intellectual structures of Information
Retrieval (IR) ( Ding, Chowdhury, &amp; Foo, 2001 ) and as a means of increasing search variety for end users in the domain of IR ( Ding &amp; Chowdhury, 2000 ). He (2000) utilised the analytic technique to map the dynamics in artificial intelligence and concluded that it is possible to identify hot topics in a particular scientific field and map dynamics in the topics using co-word analysis. Similarly, Courtial and Law (1989) conducted a co-word study of artificial intelligence to determine the effectiveness of content analysis in the process of mapping research literature in software engineering. Whittaker (1989) applied co-word analysis on words in titles and keywords to explore the adequacy of the method in mapping literature on acidification research.

However, one of the very important developments that led to the current study can be found in a study conducted by Takahata, Asano, Kouchi, and Takagi (2003) . These authors set out to test and further de-velop a hypothesis that could link a given disease to its genes by using published literature. In their study entitled  X  X  X isease-Associated Genes Extraction from Literature Database X  X  the authors used the MEDLINE database to extract biomedical terms that they in turn used to determine the co-occurrence relations. Their preliminary findings suggest that  X  X  X utomated creation of a hypothesis, which shows the disease-gene rela-tions in a step-wise manner, could be feasible through analysis of published articles X  X  (2003:704). 3. Methods and materials The diseases were purposefully selected from two sources, namely:
A list of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  X  s( CDC, 2002 ) AIDS-defining diseases in per-sons with documented HIV infection found in the Internet.
 Cheesbrough (2000, 257) .

The selection of the OIs was done to strike a balance between the most common and less common infec-tions. For purposes of this study, only those OIs that apply to both males and females were included in the sample of diseases. Documents related to these diseases were retrieved, downloaded and stored in electronic spreadsheets prepared with Microsoft Excel, version 2002.
 3.1. Database
The source of the bibliographic data was the MEDLINE database. MEDLINE is an electronic database created by the National Library of Medicine and offers a wide range of information on such subjects as medicine, nursing, dentistry, veterinary medicine, the health care system, and pre-clinical sciences from over 4600 medical journals. MEDLINE uses the Medical Subject Headings to index documents. It includes cita-tions from Index Medicus, International Nursing Index, Index to Dental Literature, PREMEDLINE,
AIDSLINE, BIOETHICSLINE, and HealthSTAR. 3.2. Procedure
The preliminary exercise involved the preparation of a list of search terms. The online MeSH thesaurus that is linked to the EBSCO electronic publishing company  X  s website was used to generate the list of the technical search terms. Table 1 provides a list of diseases with the corresponding positive MeSH terms/ phrases used to search for relevant documents.

Basically, an online advanced Boolean search was conducted using the MeSH search terms in three stages: A general search was done for the documents related to HIV/AIDS. As the earliest document on HIV/
AIDS was published in 1982, this year was chosen to be the starting point in subsequent searches involv-ing the other OIs.
 A general search was done for the documents related to each of the OIs.

The third set of data was collected through searching for documents related to the OIs within the AIDS subset of the MEDLINE database. In this way, all documents on OIs as they relate to HIV/AIDS were retrieved for analysis.

The search was limited to the  X  X  X ord in subject heading X  X  field, simply referred to as MW. We preferred the use of the MW search strategy to other similar techniques because it allows users to search using the indexed word, both as major and minor heading words, within the subject headings. Comparatively, the  X  X  X xact sub-ject heading (MH) mode employs the use of a phrase to search the exact MeSH subject heading within both the major and minor headings, while the  X  X  X ord in major subject heading X  X  (MJ) uses a  X  X  major  X  X  indexed word to search for words in the MESH subject headings. On its part,  X  X  X xact major subject heading X  X  (MM) em-ploys the indexed phrase to search for the exact MeSH heading as only a major concept of the article. Having extracted and recorded the data on the electronic spreadsheets, we analyzed the data using MS
Excel 2002 software. Two co-occurrence matrices were constructed. The first matrix consisted of the fre-quency of co-occurrence of HIV/AIDS with each of the 17 OIs covered in this study. The purpose was to determine the relatedness of OIs to HIV/AIDS. The second matrix aimed at assessing the relatedness of one opportunistic disease to the other.

In order to determine how closely linked an OI is to HIV/AIDS, the infection  X  s strength of association was calculated. An OI whose strength of association was closer to 1 was said to be more closely associated with HIV/AIDS, while an OI whose strength of association was closer to 0 (zero) was said to be rarely asso-ciated with the epidemic. The underlying principle is stipulated in Krsul (2002) who observes that  X  X  X ey-words that often appear together will have strengths closer to 1, and keywords that appear together infrequently will have strengths closer to 0 X  X .

The co-word analysis algorithm was used to calculate the strength S of association between the descrip-tors (i.e. the diseases and HIV/AIDS). The formula was applied to the two co-occurrence matrices to pro-duce two proximity indexes, which were used to calculate the association values. The strength S of association values, which were rounded up to six decimal places, were measured using the following for-mula, as set out in Krsul (2002) and He (1999) .
 where C ij is the number of documents in which the keyword pair ( M documents in which keyword M i appears C j is the number of documents in which keyword M
Data analysis and presentation was done using tables and graphs, which were collected and interpreted accordingly. Whereas data were tabulated to depict the overall distribution of publications by year of pub-lication, the graphical representation of the same data gave a pictorial trend of research on, and the asso-ciation between HIV/AIDS and each OI, on the one hand, and among the OIs, on the other. 4. Results This section presents the findings in five sub-headings, namely: HIV/AIDS and OIs research: year distribution of the records, 1982 X 2003.
 HIV/AIDS and Opportunistic Infections: Co-occurrence relations.
 HIV/AIDS and OIs: Strengths of Association.
 Opportunistic Infections: Co-occurrence relations.

Opportunistic Infections: strengths of association. 4.1. HIV/AIDS and OIs research: year distribution of the records, 1982 X 2003
Table 2 presents the number of documents indexed in the MEDLINE under HIV/AIDS and various opportunistic infections from 1982 to 2003. The period of study has been divided into six three-year periods for easy tabulation. The only exception is in the 2000 X 2003 time period, which comprises four years. This table serves two main purposes. Firstly, it is meant to assist in comparing research on HIV/AIDS and each
OI through assessing the yearly distribution of relevant records as indexed in the database. Secondly, it is meant to provide the number of publications in which the diseases were independently analysed (i.e. C
C ) for the subsequent analysis of the strength of association. That is, it is meant to obtain the frequency of occurrences of keywords M i and M j .

As Table 2 shows, HIV/AIDS leads the pack with 148,220 records. The second in the ranking is Salmo-nella , which has 24,495 records. These publications are roughly six times less those of HIV/AIDS. Staph-ylococcus aureus followed very closely with 19,721 publications followed by Cytomegalovirus and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis with 16,767 and 10,501 records, respectively. The rest of the diseases, except for two, yielded less than 10,000 but more than 1000 records. These include Streptococcus pneumoniae (9790), Candida albicans (8250), Toxoplasma (7785), Herpes simplex (7199), Haemophilus influenzae (6733), and Pneumocystis carinii (6190). Others are Shigella species (4207), Varicella zoster (2693), Myco-bacterium avium-intracellulare (2497), Cryptococcus neoformans (2122), and Cryptosporidium parvum (1217). Histoplasma capsulatum and Isospora produced 741 and 266 documents, respectively.

Throughout the entire period, HIV/AIDS maintained its lead in the number of records except for the per-iod 1982 X 1984. The trend of publishing for each of the OIs and HIV/AIDS is shown in Fig. 1 , which is a graphical representation of Table 2 . The Figure shows that publications on each of the OIs remained well below 5000 throughout the study period. The rate of growth of HIV/AIDS literature was higher in the early stages of the pandemic, i.e. 1982 X 1991, as shown by the sharp increases of the number of publications. There-after, the rate of increase slows down to an extent of being almost constant in between 1991 X 1993 and 1997 X  1999 year-periods. The 2000 X 2003 year-period shows an improvement from the previous 4 two-year periods. 4.2. HIV/AIDS and opportunistic infections: Co-occurrence relations
The frequency distribution of co-occurrence of HIV/AIDS and each of the OIs is shown in Table 3 . The findings reveal that Cytomegalovirus co-occurred with HIV/AIDS in 3871 records followed by Pneumocystis carinii (3665), Toxoplasma (1471), and Mycobacterium avium -intracellulare (1266). The frequency of co-occurrence of the other OIs with HIV/AIDS was less than 1000. In the descending order, Mycobacterium tuberculosis ranked number five with 867 co-occurrences followed by Herpes simplex (591), Candida albi-cans (417), Cryptococcus neoformans (398), Salmonella (326), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (254). Others are Staphylococcus aureus (217), Varicella zoster (198), Cryptosporidium parvum (138), Histoplasma capsu-latum (103), Haemophilus influenzae (74), Isospora (72) and Shigella (43).
 Fig. 2 shows the trend of co-occurrence of HIV/AIDS and the individual OIs between 1982 and 2003.
There is an upward trend in the number of times each of the OIs co-occurs with HIV/AIDS up till early 1990s. Pneumocystis carinii reaches the peak in 1991 X 1993 and beyond that the co-occurrence frequency starts a downward movement while Cytomegalovirus  X  frequency of co-occurrence is highest in 1994 X 1996. Whereas Toxoplasma reaches its highest point at 383 in 1994 X 1996, the rest of the opportunistic diseases  X  frequency of co-occurrence continues to grow up till 1997 X 1999. Thereafter, the number of records in which these OIs co-appear with HIV/AIDS drops drastically. 4.3. HIV/AIDS and the opportunistic infections: Strengths of association
The strength of association is expressed as a ratio of the number of documents in which the terms M
M j appear together to the occurrence frequency of term M i
M . The ranking in Table 4 shows that Pneumocystis carinii leads with the strength of association of
S = 0.014641 followed by Cytomegalovirus ( S = 0.00603), Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare ( S = 0.004331), Toxoplasma ( S = 0.001876), and Cryptococcus neoformans ( S = 0.000504). Mycobacterium tuberculosis had a strength of association of S = 0.000483 while Herpes simplex ranked seventh with
S = 0.000328. Others in the descending order include Candida albicans ( S = 0.000143), Isospora ( S = 0.000132), Cryptosporidium parvum ( S = 0.000114), Varicella zoster ( S = 0.000099), Histoplasma cap-sulatum ( S = 0.000097), Streptococcus pneumoniae ( S = 0.000045), and Salmonella ( S = 0.00003). At the bottom of the table are Staphylococcus aureus ( S = 0.000017), Haemophilus influenzae ( S = 0.000006), and the Shigella , which was ranked last with the strength of association of ( S = 0.000003).
The last column in Table 4 provides the ratios for the entire period of 1982 X 2003 and not the sum of the various individual strengths of association in that period. Thus, it can be noticed that, although Pneumo-cystis carinii and Cytomegalovirus had strong associations to HIV/AIDS in 1982 X 2003 (i.e. S = 0.014641 and S = 0.00603, respectively), their strengths of association was highest in 1982 X 1984. This is well illus-trated in Fig. 3 , which at the same time provides a vivid picture of the declining associations of OIs to
HIV/AIDS. Other opportunistic diseases were less associated to HIV/AIDS during the early 1980s than they were in the late 1990s. Four of these, namely Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare , Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Cryptosporidium parvum , and Haemophilus influenzae had no association in the early 1990s.
Generally the Figure shows a decline in the strengths of association for all OIs. 4.4. Opportunistic infections: Co-occurrence relations
Table 5 presents the frequencies of co-occurrences among the opportunistic infections. The table shows that Candida albicans had the highest co-occurrence rate with Staphylococcus aureus (476) and Cryptococ-cus neoformans (183) while the frequencies of its co-appearance with each of the remaining opportunistic infections were less than 100. Cryptosporidium parvum had the least number of appearances with each of the other diseases. Cytomegalovirus appeared 578 times with Herpes simplex while it co-occurred in 470 records with Pneumocystis carinii , 406 with Toxoplasma , 283 with Varicella zoster and 132 times with
Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare . Haemophilus influenzae co-appeared with Streptococcus pneumoniae in 1343. Herpes simplex recorded 162 and 103 appearances with Varicella zoster and Toxoplasma , respectively.
Out of its 10,501 publications in the MEDLINE database, Mycobacterium tuberculosis co-occurred in 278 publications with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and less than 100 times with each of the remaining
OIs. There were several cases of zero frequencies of term co-occurrence. 4.5. Opportunistic infections: Strengths of association
The strengths of association values, shown in Table 6 , show that the strongest link was witnessed between Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae with a score of S = 0.027363. Equally significant scores were witnessed between Candida albicans and two other OIs, namely, Cryptococcus neo-formans ( S = 0.001913) and Staphylococcus aureus ( S = 0.001393). Other fairly high strengths of association were between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare ( S = 0.002947), Pneumo-cystis carinii and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare ( S = 0.001455), Herpes simplex and Varicella Zoster ( S = 0.001353), and Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae ( S = 0.001093). Cytomegalovirus re-corded strong links with four OIs, i.e. Herpes simplex ( S = 0.002767), Pneumocystis carinii ( S = 0.002128), and Toxoplasmosis ( S = 0.001263) and Varicella Zoster ( S = 0.001774). It can be noticed that a disease gen-erates the strength of association equalling to one (1) when the S is calculated against the same disease. 5. Discussions
An estimated 148,220 records on HIV/AIDS were analysed between 1982 and 2003. Comparatively, the 1991 X 1999 period yielded more publications than 1982 X 1990. Whereas the period of 1982 X 1990 yielded 33,462 records, 1991 X 1999 had 82,599 publications, which is more than double. Similar findings have been documented in previous studies. For example, Pratt (1992) analysed a cumulative total of 29,077 AIDS re-cords between 1981 and 1990, although this figure did not represent the total number of AIDS-related items in the MEDLINE database ( FitzSimons, 1993; Pratt, 1993 ). On his part, Elford (cited in FitzSimons, 1993 ) estimated some 33,000 publications on HIV/AIDS in the same database between 1981 and 1990. Previous studies have indicated that the growth of AIDS literature has been exponential in nature and that this growth rate matched the number of AIDS cases ( Macias-Chapula, Rodea-Castro, &amp; Narvaez-Berthelemot, 1998 ). This pattern was, however, not identified in this study.

Whereas research on individual OIs has shown an upward trend when we consider the growth of related literature, Table 2 shows that it still remains far below that of AIDS. This can be attributed to the heavy funding geared towards AIDS research, most probably because of the disease  X  s devastating effect on the social, economic and political development. Secondly, its cure is still far from being discovered, a situation that may have called for continued financial disbursements. This has culminated in the establishment by
UNAIDS of the Global Fund to fight the disease. The Global Fund is geared towards financing the fight against not only AIDS, but also tuberculosis and malaria ( UNAIDS, 2004 ). This may also explain the con-siderable number of publications on Mycobacterium tuberculosis .

Summers and Kates (2004) estimate that the US government has invested approximately $150 billion for both domestic and international HIV/AIDS programs since 1982. Funding categories for which this amount of money has been invested are care (health and support services), cash and housing assistance, research, prevention and global or international programs. The authors estimate that 16% of the federal funding for the fiscal year 2004 has been allocated to the research activities. The Global Fund  X  s disburse-ments to different world geographic regions and by grant agreements for year 2004 is projected to be a total of $280,267,086 ( UNAIDS, 2004 ). In contrast, except for an estimated $320,000 awarded to Digene Cor-poration to develop a new generation of tests for the diagnosis of Herpes simplex virus (HSV) ( Digene Cor-poration, 2001 ), there were no immediate data on the funding statistics on other OIs.

Concerning the co-occurrence of HIV/AIDS and OIs, Tables 3 and 4 and Figs. 2 and 3 show that there was high co-occurrence rate and strength of association between the two in the early years of the HIV/
AIDS epidemic, i.e. between 1980 and 1985. Fig. 2 reveals that the co-occurrence trend reversed and there-after the co-occurrence rate in Table 4 , and strengths of association, shown in Fig. 3 , continued to decline up to year 2003. Fig. 3 reveals that Pneumocystis carinii  X  s and Cytomegalovirus  X  associations with HIV/ AIDS have declined with time from S = 0.014641 and S = 0.00603 in 1982 X 1984 to S = 0.000622 and S = 0.000471 during the 2000 X 2003 period, respectively. This accounts for 2253% decrease in the case of
Pneumocystis carinii and 1180% for Cytomegalovirus. Also affected is the Mycobacterium avium complex disease.
 This kind of scenario has been attributed to the use of anti-HIV drugs ( New Mexico AIDS Education &amp; Training Center, 2003 ). In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, OIs caused a lot of sickness and deaths.
However, once people started taking combination antiviral therapy, a lot fewer people got OIs. Cohen (2000a) , too, notes that through effective treatments for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) and HIV, the PCP rates declined drastically in the late 1990s in developed countries. Even in the poorest countries,  X  X  X ccess to anti-HIV drugs and formula has been made cheaper and easier through the largesse of donors, discounts from industry, new trade laws and the tenacity of individual clinicians X  X  ( Cohen, 2000b ).
Generally, remarkable progress has been made in improving the quality and duration of life for HIV-infected persons in the industrialized world since AIDS was first reported. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2002) reports that improved quality and duration of life during the first AIDS decade  X  X  X ccurred because of improved recognition of opportunistic disease processes, improved therapy for acute and chronic complications, and introduction of chemoprophylaxis against key opportunistic pathogens X  X .

During the last decade there was extraordinary progress in the development of highly active antiretro-viral therapies (HAART), which have greatly reduced the incidence of OIs and extended life substantially ( CDC, 2002 ). Not only has the incidence of OIs reduced in HIV/AIDS immune-compromised persons, there has been a reduction also in morbidity and mortality associated with the diseases ( Palella et al., 1998 ). Palella et al. (1998) observe that  X  X  X he incidence of any of the three major opportunistic infections (i.e. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , Mycobacterium avium complex disease , and cytomegalovirus retinitis ) had declined from 21.9 per 100 person-years in 1994 to 3.7 per 100 person-years by mid-1997 X  X . With this kind of trend, we should expect the presence of OIs in persons infected with HIV to decrease further con-sidering that many nations are advocating for the free provision of anti-HIV drugs.

Table 2 shows that there were no descriptors for Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and Cryptospori-dium parvum on the first two and three periods of years, respectively. The co-occurrence matrices in Tables 3 and 4 show similar findings on Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare , Cryptosporidium parvum , Mycobac-terium tuberculosis , and Haemophilus influenzae . This may be due to the fact that NLM did not create such MeSH terms until 1988 and 1991, approximately. A similar situation happened with the creation of the
HIV/AIDS descriptor around 1982. The first HIV/AIDS publication, according to this study, was pub-lished in 1982 yet HIV/AIDS was clinically diagnosed in the period October 1980 X  X ay 1981 ( Begley, Check, Wingert, &amp; Conway, 2001; Konforti, 2001 ; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
NIAID, 2003 ). A possible explanation underlying such time lapse between the discovery of the disease and the publication of literature on the respective diseases are well illustrated in Chan, Jin, Rousseau,
Vaughan, and Yu (2003) . In their study of Newspaper coverage of SARS , the authors argue that  X  X  X t is just human that the meaning of new phenomena is not immediately clear, and that it takes a whole process of understanding before the full significance of the new phenomena becomes clear X  X . This may apply to data-base indexers, too. Seemingly, it takes some time before a disease  X  s descriptor is formulated.
The rankings of OIs in relation to HIV/AIDS in Table 3 and Fig. 2 shows that Pneumocystis carinii , Cyto-megalovirus , Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare , Toxoplasma , Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Herpes sim-plex appeared more commonly in HIV/AIDS records. These infections exhibited strong associations as shown in Table 4 and Fig. 3 . Ranking number one in Table 4 is Pneumocystis carinii , showing that the infec-tion is the most common in persons with HIV/AIDS. According to Brookmeyer and Gail (1994, p. 10) , Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is common in all risk groups and accounts for about half of all
AIDS-defining conditions. The UNAIDS (1998, 4) , too, reports that PCP is the  X  X  X ost frequent HIV-asso-ciated opportunistic infection in industrialized countries X  X . The second most common infection, according to the findings of this study, is Cytomegalovirus followed by Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare , Toxoplasma ,
Cryptococcus neoformans , Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Herpes simplex , and Candidiasis in that order. Just like in the case of Pneumocystis carinii , almost everyone with HIV tests positive for Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) ( New Mexico AIDS Education &amp; Training Center, 2003 ). Infections that are rarely linked to HIV/AIDS include Shigella , Haemophilus influenzae , Staphylococcus aureus , and Salmonella .
 It can also be seen that the order of ranking of the infections in Table 3 is different from that in Table 4 .
For instance, whereas Cytomegalovirus leads the pack followed by Pneumocystis carinii in Table 3 , the order reverses in Table 4 . Toxoplasma and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare have also changed positions.
Cryptococcus neoformans has jumped from position 8 in Table 3 to position 5 in Table 4 . Mycobacterium tuberculosis has moved down one step to position 6 in Table 4 just as Herpes simplex and Candida albicans .
It can be seen that except for the Shigella viruses, which maintained the same position, all the other infec-tions were affected. This can well be explained by Krsul  X  s (2002) observation that  X  X  X wo keywords that appear infrequently in the database but always appear together will have larger strength values than keywords that appear many times in the database almost always together X  X .

The co-occurrence of terms among the OIs themselves shows that the highest frequency of co-occurrence was witnessed between Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae (i.e. 1343). Their strength of association value was also the highest ( S = 0.027363). Their high frequency of co-occurrence and associa-tion value can be attributed to the fact that they are both common causative agents of respiratory tract infections ( Jones &amp; Karlowsky, 2002 ). Significant frequencies of co-occurrences were also witnessed between Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus (476) and between Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans (183). Cytomegalovirus was the most common, having co-appeared with Herpes simplex (578),
Pneumocystis carinii (470), Toxoplasma (406), Varicella zoster (283), and 132 times with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare . Some of these co-occurrences among the OIs were due to two or more of the diseases being analyzed in one HIV-based publication. Arguably, therefore, the fact that two or more infectious diseases can be found in an HIV immune compromised patient, may not be proof enough that they are medically related or associated. It is, however, advisable that a medical analysis be conducted to determine the relatedness of one OI to the other. Apart from these OIs being either bacterial or micro-bacterial, or fungal, or protozoal, and or viral infections, we were unable to conclusively establish their inter-relation-ships in this study. 6. Conclusion and recommendations
The purpose of this work was to measure the strength of association between HIV/AIDS and various purposefully selected opportunistic diseases using a uniform search strategy. It follows therefore that the collected data may not be wholly representative of the research activities that have been conducted on these diseases. Further studies are recommended to analyse AIDS literature, in other sources such as the mass media, which is not indexed in the MEDLINE database.

It is noteworthy observing that there are significant differences in the occurrence of OIs in AIDS patients in different regions. For example, whereas Pneumocystis carinii , Mycobacterium avium intracellulare and
Histoplasma capsulatum are relatively the most common infective agents in Europe and/or North America ( Williams, 1991 ), Tuberculosis kills more HIV-infected people in Africa than any other AIDS-related dis-ease while it remains rare in AIDS patients in the United States and Europe ( Cohen, 2000a ). It is therefore necessary to measure the strengths of association of HIV/AIDS and OIs in individual geographic regions. By so doing, appropriate strategies may be developed for AIDS patients.
 This notwithstanding and in conclusion, we found that the most common OIs in persons with HIV/ AIDS exhibited strong relations of association with the disease. These infections are: Candidiasis , a fungal infection of the mouth, throat, or vagina which occurs even with fairly high T-cells;
Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a viral infection that causes eye disease that can lead to blindness and occurs mostly when the T-cell count is under 50;
Herpes simplex viruses , which causes oral herpes (cold sores) or genital herpes and whose outbreaks can be much more frequent and more severe in HIV infected persons. They can occur at any T-cell count;
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC or MAI), a bacterial infection that can cause recurring fevers, gen-eral sick feelings, problems with digestion, and serious weight loss and occurs when the T-cell count is under 75;
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a fungal infection that can cause a fatal pneumonia and occurs when T-cell count is under 200; Toxoplasmosis (Toxo), a protozoal infection of the brain and occurs when T-cell count is under 100;
Tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infection that attacks the lungs, and can cause meningitis and occurs at any T-cell count.
Wormell  X  s (1998) observation that trends and developments in society, science and business can be traced through the informetric analyses of databases forms a strong argument for the use of informetrics tech-niques in LIS research. In her words,
Results of the current study, we believe, have implications for the indexers of information materials, too, especially in cross-referencing. Supposing that the highest S value between the highest-ranking OI (i.e.
Pneumocystis carinii  X  X CP) and HIV/AIDS was 0.999654, it would have meant that wherever HIV/AIDS was a topic of discussion, there was an equal chance that PCP was also discussed alongside it. Put in other words, wherever PCP is diagnosed in patients, there are high chances that the said patient would be suffer-ing from HIV/AIDS. Hence, the indexer would be advised to make see and/or see-also cross-references to HIV/AIDS materials when indexing PCP materials and vise versa.

Finally, we strongly concur with previous researchers that an informetric analysis of database literature, using a co-word analysis method, to determine a disease  X  s relatedness to pathogens associated with it, is feasible.
