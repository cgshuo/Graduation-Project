 In many college classrooms, studen ts are passive spectators and the transmittal model of teaching is prevalent in most classes. In contrast, Vygotsky X  X  social-constr uctivist view emphasizes the importance of making students become active learners. Many active learning techniques have been developed, primarily focused on making students active participants in various kinds of in class activities like discussion, writing a nd talking. However, there is evidence that the typical university classroom setting presents some obstacles for realizing maximum effectiveness of class wide discussion. These obstacles include the effects of production blocking, the hierarchical power st ructures within the classroom and the lack of sense of community. Having realized the great potential of Web 2.0 social software in meeting these challenges, the objective in the proposed research is to build an active learning environment by bring backchannel discussion up front using CMC tools. A design base d research method will be used to explore effects of using this tool in classes. H5.3 [Group and Organization Interfaces] : Collaborative computing. General Terms : Design, Experimenta tion, Human Factors. In many college classrooms, students are passive spectators. The professor arrives, gives a lecture and students learn individually, listening and taking notes. This model of teaching in classes in called the transmittal model in which students learn by passively receiving knowledge from the t eacher. However, according to social-constructivist theories of learning, knowledge can not be simply pulled from text books or be poured from teachers X  heads to students X  heads. Instead knowledge is constructed by engaging individual learners to actively bring their prior knowledge to make sense of the new information whic h will further be constructed as knowledge embedded their minds. In these theory views, the knowledge construction process is influenced by its surrounding community (the social context). In contrast to the transmittal model in which students are passive information recipients, the social constructivist model emphasizes the importance of placing students at the center of the learning process  X  that is by becoming active learners. Currently, active learning has been recommended as one of the seven principles for good practices in undergraduate education[1]. Class discussion (including disc ussion, debate, questioning and explaining, etc.) is often noted as a common and effective strategy for promoting active learning [1], however, in traditional classrooms it is common to find that (a) the few vocal students consume most of the scarce in-class discussion time and it makes students who are non-vocal but want to say something not able to participate in class discussion(b) the teacher acts as a  X  X age on the stage, X  controlling everything going on in the class and thus some students are forced to speak in classes; (c) some students may have negative feelings when they are caught by surprise; (d) some students suppress their question until the end of the class. Generally, these pheromones could be attributed to the following three facts in classes: Production Blocking: students meet face to face and communicate through verbal communication. Th ey are encouraged to speak up freely. However, at any given time only one individual can talk and other people are  X  X locked X  because they have to wait for their turns to talk. Production blocking is considered to be one of the major reasons for the productivity loss in group meetings and discussions [2]. Hierarchical Power Structure: In traditional classrooms, the power relationship between teacher and student is straightforward. In traditional classroom settings, par ticularly in university courses, the teacher is regarded as a  X  X age on the stage X , someone who has ultimate right to control class info rmation and activities, presumably for the sake of the students. The power relationship between teacher and student is one-directional and highly imbalanced. Only the teacher can control the class and students have no or minimal influence on the organization and development of the course [6]. Lack of Sense of Community: students in most classes report a low level of sense of community. Currently, mid-size (40-50) to increases, students become faces instead of people. In classes of this size  X  X eelings of disconnectedne ss are common among students X  [7]. Prior research on learning theories, social psychology and computer-mediated communication (CMC) has invested considerable effort in solving the above mentioned problems. One focus of recent work is the opportunity provided by computer-mediated communication (CMC). Researches have shown considerable potential for the use of CMC to improve group discussions, thus the goal of the cu rrent research is to tackle the challenges for in-class active learning by integrating CMC technologies into the classroom context. Currently, classrooms have evolved to employ a large number of educational technologies. With the advent of Web 2.0, the emergence of various social software (blog, microblog, wiki and many social networking services) have brought educators a nd students even more channels for communication and interaction. In prior work we have demonstrat ed that teachers can organize an event and use some technology tool to increase students X  participation. For example, in [4, 5], the instructor organized a video viewing session, and used a public video commenting system with which students can post their comments on the videos as they were watching the videos and display the comments on the pubic display below the video in real time. It was found that students used this tool to make comments, raise questions, provide feedback to the teachers and interact with each other and students X  in class participation rate and students X  sense of community are increased. However, an event like video comment takes place over a limited period of time. A more challenging question is how to sustain students X  engagement and partic ipation in the many different activities and topics that aris e during an 18-week course. The current proposed research is the study of a public commenting service-ClassCommons in classes, whose goal is to bring students X  backchannel discussions up front, inv ite more students to participate in class discussions and interact more with each other, eventually achieving the goal of enhanced sense of community. Students can post their questions/comments during the class. In the mean time, the message will be displayed on the public display in the front the classroom, viewable to all the people. Teacher can either choose to reply by posting a comment or by addressing it verbally to the whole class. Other students can also reply and make more comments as they wish. Students can decide whether to post anonymously or not. As a more concrete example of use, consider this ClassCommons design scenario: Jane finds that she does not quite understand a concept just discussed in class, bu t she is too shy to raise her hand. Instead she uses ClassCommons to post a question. The teacher then addresses the question orally; me anwhile other students contribute to the discussion by posting their own thoughts on the public display. They can easily initiate in-class interactions and they can appropriate the use of the system as they wish. We are particularly interested in investigating the following research questions: RQ1: What factors influence students and teachers X  adoption of public commenting in classrooms? RQ2: Can public commenting help to increase student participation in course-related issues and topics? If so, then how? RQ3: Can public commenting help to flatten the power differentials among teacher and students, and among students with differing characteristics? If so, then how? RQ4: Can public commenting facilitate the building of a classroom learning community? If so, then how? I am going to adopt a Design-Based Research (DBR) approach to answer the aforementioned research questions. DBR is sometimes described as  X  understanding the world by trying to change it. In my case, I am going to develop and deploy the ClassCommons system in undergraduate classes. An iterative development process will be adopted based on students X  and teachers X  feedback to improve the system. In the meanwhile, I will use surveys, content analysis on the messages posted, in terviews as well as in class ethnography to uncover how the teachers and students are using this aforementioned research questions. In spring 2009, the first iteration of the Classcommons system was used in an undergraduate course at Penn State University. Our exploratory study shows that ClassCommons gradually became a tool for students to help them with class discussion and organization; at the same time the playful comments posted by students added on-going  X  X un X  to the class which might also help to keep students engaged in class activities[3]. I have also learned several less ons from this first deployment experience, including the fact that social media is too easy to be used as a playful tool for students, and thus teacher X  X  participation is very important in guiding students using the system in a right way and also the necessity that pedagogical adjustments are needed to better integrate this kind of tool into classrooms because of the fact that with the use of this system students get more control over the flow of class and teachers could be easily be interrupted during the class. These are the challenges and questions to be explored in the next step. [1] Boyle, J.T. Using classroom communication systems to [2] Diehl, M. and Stroebe, W.
