 Abstract In this paper, we describe tools and resources for the study of African languages developed at the Collaborative Research Centre 632  X  X  X nformation Structure X  X . These include deeply annotated data collections of 25 sub-Saharan languages that are described together with their annotation scheme, as well as the corpus tool ANNIS, which provides unified access to a broad variety of annotations created with a range of different tools. With the application of ANNIS to several African data collections, we illustrate its suitability for the purpose of language documentation, distributed access, and the creation of data archives.
 Keywords African language resources Pragmatics Corpus search infrastructure 1 Information structure The Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 632  X  X  X nformation structure: the linguistic means for structuring utterances, sentences and texts X  X  brings together scientists from different fields of linguistics and neighbouring disciplines from the University of Potsdam and Humboldt University of Berlin. One specific aspect of the research carried out at the CRC is the use and advancement of corpus technologies for complex linguistic annotations, such as the annotation of information structure (IS). We define IS as the structuring of linguistic information in order to optimize information transfer within discourse: information needs to be prepared ( X  X  X ack-aged X  X ) in different ways depending on the goals a speaker pursues within discourse; see e.g. Chafe ( 1976 ), Krifka ( 2008 ).

Fundamental concepts of IS include the concepts  X  X opic X ,  X  X ocus X ,  X  X ackground X  and  X  X nformation status X . Broadly speaking, the topic is the entity a specific sentence is construed about , focus represents the new or newsworthy information a sentence conveys, background is the part of the sentence that is familiar to the hearer, and information status refers to different degrees of familiarity of an entity; see Krifka ( 2008 ) for a recent overview of relevant notions of IS.

Languages differ with respect to the means of realization of IS categories, where cross-linguistic variation is often triggered by language-specific properties (e.g., tone languages vs. intonation languages). This motivates a typological comparison of the realization of IS categories in less-studied non-European languages as compared to European intonation languages, on which most existing theories are manifestations in different sub-Saharan languages, as well as the differentiation between different types of focus, i.e., term focus (focus on arguments/adjuncts), predicate focus (focus on verb/verb phrase/TAM 1 /truth value), and sentence focus (focus on the whole utterance).

We provide a description of corpora of 25 sub-Saharan languages created for this purpose, together with a description of ANNIS (ANNotation of Information Structure, Dipper and Go  X  tze 2005 ; Chiarcos et al. 2008 ; Zeldes et al. 2009 ), the technical infrastructure developed to support linguists in their work with these data collections. ANNIS is specifically designed to support corpora with rich and deep annotation, as IS manifests itself on practically all levels of linguistic description. It provides user-friendly means of querying and visualizing different kinds of linguistic annotations, including flat, layer-based annotations as used for linguistic glosses, but also hierarchical annotations as used for syntax annotation.

This article is structured as follows: Sect. 2 gives an overview of the investigative goals of the research groups at the CRC. Section 3 describes the language data that has been created or adapted for the study of these research interests, and Sect. 4 gives details on the preparation of this data towards a uniform, sustainable, and searchable language resource. Section 5 presents search and visualization options in ANNIS as compared to other tools. A summary of the article is given in Sect. 6 . 2 Research activities at the CRC Within the Collaborative Research Centre 632, there are several projects eliciting data in large amounts and great diversity. This data, originating from various languages from (a) different language families, (b) different modalities (written and spoken language) and (c) specific research questions, motivates the specifications of the linguistic database ANNIS. 2.1 Linguistic database The project  X  X  X inguistic database for information structure: Annotation and Retrieval X  X , henceforth database project , coordinates annotation activities within the CRC 632, provides service to projects in the creation and maintenance of data collections, and conducts theoretical research on multi-level annotations. Its primary goals, however, are the development and investigation of techniques to process, integrate, and exploit deeply annotated corpora with multiple kinds of annotations. One concrete outcome of these efforts is the linguistic database ANNIS. See Sect. 5 for the specific facilities of ANNIS, its application to several corpora of African languages and its use as a general-purpose tool for the publication, visualization, and querying of linguistic data. 2.2 Gur and Kwa languages Gur and Kwa languages, two genetically related West African language groups, are the focus of project B1  X  X  X nteraction of information structure and grammar in Gur and Kwa languages X  X , henceforth Gur-Kwa project . In the first research stage, the precise means of expression of the IS category focus were explored as well as their functions in the Gur and Kwa languages. For this purpose, a number of data collections for several languages were created (Sect. 3.1 ). Findings obtained with this data led to different subquestions which are of special interest from a cross-syntactically marked focus constructions with features of narrative sentences (Schwarz and Fiedler 2007 ), (2) the study of verb-centered focus (i.e., focus on verb/TAM/truth value), for which there are special means of realization in Gur and Kwa (Schwarz 2010 ), and (3) the identification of systematic focus-topic overlap, i.e., coincidence of focus and topic in sentence-initial nominal constituents (Fiedler et al. 2010 ). The project X  X  findings on IS are evaluated typologically for 19 selected languages. The questions raised by the project serve the superordinate goal of expanding our knowledge of linguistically relevant information structural categories in the less-studied Gur and Kwa languages as well as the interaction between IS, grammar, and language type. 2.3 Chadic languages Project B2  X  X  X nformation Structure in the Chadic Languages X  X , henceforth Chadic project , investigates focus phenomena in Chadic languages. The Chadic languages are a branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family mainly spoken in northern Nigeria, Niger, and Chad. As languages with complex tonal systems, the Chadic languages represent an interesting subject for research into focus because here, the intonational or tonal marking, which is commonly used for marking focus in European languages, is in potential conflict with lexical tone; therefore, Chadic languages resort to alternative means for marking focus.

The languages investigated in the Chadic project include the western Chadic languages Hausa, Tangale, and Guruntum and the central Chadic languages Bura, South Marghi, and Tera. The main research goals of the Chadic project are a deeper understanding of the following asymmetries: (1) subject focus is obligatorily marked, but marking of object focus is optional (Hartmann and Zimmermann 2007 ); (2) in Tangale and Hausa there are sentences that are ambiguous between an object-focus interpretation and a predicate-focus interpretation, but in intonation languages like English and German, object focus and predicate focus are always marked differently from each other (Hartmann and Zimmermann 2007 ); (3) in Hausa, Bole, and Guruntum there is only a tendency to distinguish different types of focus (new-information focus vs. contrastive focus), but in languages like Hungarian and Finnish, this differentiation is obligatory (Hartmann and Zimmermann 2009 ). 2.4 Focus from a cross-linguistic perspective The project A5  X  X  X ocus realization, focus interpretation, and focus use from a crosslinguistic perspective X  X , henceforth focus project , investigates the correspon-dence between the realization, interpretation and use of focus, with an emphasis on the expression and interpretation of focus in African and south-east Asian languages. It is structured into three fields of research: (1) the relation between differences in realization and differences in semantic meaning or pragmatic function, (2) realization, interpretation, and use of predicate focus, and (3) association with focus. (1) The relation between differences in realization and differences in the use and (2) The investigation of the realization, interpretation and use of predicate focus (3) Association with focus refers to the fact that the interpretation of focus-3 Collections of African language data at the CRC 3.1 Gur and Kwa corpora The Gur and Kwa corpora currently comprise data from 19 languages. Due to the scarceness of information available on IS in the Gur and Kwa languages, data had to be elicited, most of which was done during field research, mainly in West Africa, and some in Germany with the help of native speakers of the respective languages. The typologically diverse languages in which we elicited data ourselves are: Baatonum, Buli, Byali, Dagbani, Ditammari, Gurene, Konkomba, Konni, Nateni, Waama, Yom (Gur languages), and Aja, Akan, Efutu, Ewe, Fon, Foodo, Lelemi, Anii (Kwa languages). The elicitation of the data was mainly based on the questionnaire on information structure developed by our research group (QUIS, see Sect. 4.1 ). This ensured that comparable data for the typological comparison could be obtained. Moreover, language-specific additional tasks and questionnaires tailored to a more detailed analysis or language-specific traits were developed.
As the coding of IS varies across different types of texts, different genres were included in the corpus, such as (semi-)spontaneous speech, translations, as well as mono-and dialogues. Most of the languages do not have a long tradition of literacy, so the corpus data mainly represent oral communication. In all, the carefully collected heterogeneous data provides a corpus that gives a comprehensive picture of IS and, in particular, the focus systems in these languages. 3.2 Hausar Baka corpus In the Chadic project, data from six Chadic languages has been considered. One of the larger data sets annotated in the Chadic project is drawn from Hausar Baka (Randell et al. 1998 ), a collection of videotaped Hausa dialogues recording natural interaction in various cultural milieus, involving over fifty individuals of different age and gender. The annotated data set consists of approximately 1,500 sentences. The corpus was annotated according to the guidelines for Linguistic Information Structure Annotation (LISA, see Sect. 4.2 ), and can be accessed over ANNIS (see Sect. 5 ). The Chadic languages show various forms of syntactic displacement, and in order to account for this an additional annotation level was added: constituents are marked as EX -SITU  X   X  X   X   X  X  if they occur displaced from their canonical, unmarked position. An evaluation of the focus type and the displacement status reveals tendencies in the morphosyntactic realization of different focus types, see Sect. 5.2 . 3.3 Hausa Internet corpus Besides the data collections which are currently available at the CRC and in ANNIS, further resources are continuously being created. As part of this effort, a corpus of written Hausa has been created through an internal CRC cooperation.
The corpora previously mentioned mostly comprise elicited sentences from little-documented languages with rather small language communities. Hausa, by contrast, is spoken by more than 24 million native speakers, with large amounts of Hausa material available on the Internet (some of it parallel to material in other, better-studied languages). This makes Hausa a promising language for the creation of resources that enable a quantitative study of information structure.

The Hausa Internet corpus is designed to cover different kinds of written language, including news articles from international radio stations (e.g., http://www.dw-world.de ), religious texts, literary prose, and also material similar to spontaneous spoken language (e.g., in chat logs). Parallel sections of the corpus comprise excerpts from the novel Ruwan Bagaja by Abubakar Imam, Bible and Quran sections, and the Declaration of Human Rights. As will be described in Sect. 4.3 , these parallel sections open up possibilities for semi-automatic morphosyntactic annotation, providing a unique source for the study of information structure in Hausa. Section 5.2 gives an example for bootstrapping ex-situ constituents in ANNIS only on the basis of morphosyntactic annotation. 4 Data elicitation and annotation 4.1 Elicitation with QUIS The questionnaire on information structure (Skopeteas et al. 2006 ) provides a tool for the collection of natural linguistic data, both spoken and written, as well as for the elaboration of grammars of IS in genetically diverse languages. Focus information, for instance, is typically elicited by embedding an utterance in a question context. To avoid the influence of a mediator (working) language, the main body of QUIS is built on the basis of pictures and short movies representing a nearly culture-and language-neutral context. Besides highly controlled experimental settings, less controlled settings serve the purpose of eliciting longer, cohesive, natural texts for studying categories such as focus and topic in a near-natural environment. An example from Konni (Gur) is shown in Fig. 1 as represented in the ANNIS database. 4.2 Transcription and manual annotation At the CRC, the annotation scheme LISA has been developed with special respect to applicability across typologically different languages (Dipper et al. 2007 ). It comprises guidelines for the annotation of phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and IS. The data mentioned above is, in the case of speech, transcribed according to IPA conventions, or otherwise written according to orthographic conventions; all data is annotated with glosses and IS, with a translation of each sentence into English or French, including (optionally) additional notes, references to QUIS experiments, and references to audio files and metadata. 4.3 (Semi-)automatic annotation For the automation of annotation, we pursue two strategies: (1) the training of classifiers on annotated data, and (2) the projection of annotations on texts in a source language to parallel texts in a target language.

Machine learning ANNIS allows one to export query matches and all their annotated features to the table format ARFF which serves as input to the data mining tool WEKA (Witten and Frank 2005 ), where instances can be clustered, or used to train classifiers for any annotation level.
 Projection Based on (paragraph-, sentence-or verse-) aligned sections in the Hausa internet corpus, we plan to project linguistic annotations from English texts to Hausa, first part of speech annotations and, later, possibly nominal chunks. See also De Pauw et al. (this volume) for a more thorough discussion of alignment experiments and for a documentation of the projection of part of speech-annotation from the source language English to the target language Swahili, which partly makes use of the same linguistic resources (e.g. Bible, Quran). On the projected annotation, we will train a tagger/chunker to annotate the remaining, non-parallel sections of the Hausa Internet corpus. Existing manual annotations (e.g., of the Hausar Baka corpus) will then serve as a gold standard for evaluation purposes.
Concerning projection techniques, we expect to face a number of problems: (1) the question of how to assign part of speech tags to categories existing only in the target language [e.g., the person-aspect complex in Hausa that binds together information about both the verb (aspect) and its (pronominal subject) argument, Newman ( 2000 )]; (2) issues of orthography: the official orthography of Hausa ( Boko ) is systematically underspecified with respect to linguistically relevant distinctions (cf. Crysmann ( 2009 )). Neither vowel length nor different qualities of certain consonants ( r ) are represented, and also, there is no marking of tones (see Example (1), with fully specified word forms in brackets). Distinguishing such homographs, however, is essential to the appropriate interpretation and linguistic analysis of utterances. We expect that in these cases, statistical techniques using context features may help to predict correct vocalization and tonal patterns. Example 1 ciki 1. [c X   X  k X  ` i, noun] stomach, 2. [c X   X  k X   X  , prep.] inside dace 1. [da ` ace  X  e, noun] coincidence, 2. [da  X  ace ` e, verb] be appropriate
See also Moran (this volume) for a more general discussion of the problem of underspecified mapping relations between scriptemes in a transcription system (i.e. the symbols used for representing a sound in the database) and their actual representation in IPA, and for a concrete proposal for resolving such ambiguities in mapping relations by means of an interoperable format. 5 ANNIS: the linguistic database of information structure annotation 5.1 Conception and architecture ANNIS is a web-based corpus interface built to query and visualize multilevel corpora. It allows the user to formulate queries on arbitrary, possibly nested annotation levels, which may be conflictingly overlapping or discontinuous. The types of annotations handled by ANNIS include, among others, flat, layer-based annotations (e.g., for glossing), hierarchical trees (e.g., syntax) and acyclic graphs (e.g. for coreference annotation). The system is available open source for download under the Apache 2.0 license at: http://www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/d1/annis/ .
Source data As an architecture designed to facilitate diverse and integrative research on IS, ANNIS can import formats from a broad variety of tools from NLP and manual annotation using the metamodel-based SaltNPepper converter frame-work (Zipser and Romary 2010 )). Supported formats include EXMARaLDA (Schmidt 2004 ), TigerXML produced e.g. by annotate (Brants and Plaehn 2000 )or Synpathy ( http://www.lat-mpi.eu/tools/synpathy/ ), MMAX2 (Mu  X  ller and Strube 2006 ), RSTTool (O X  X onnell 2000 ), PALinkA (Orasan 2003 ), Toolbox (Busemann and Busemann 2008 ), etc. These tools allow researchers to annotate data for syntax, semantics, morphology, prosody, phonetics, referentiality, lexis, and much more, as their research questions require. All annotated data can be mapped to and merged in the general interchange format PAULA (Dipper 2005 ; Dipper and Go  X  tze 2005 ), a highly expressive standoff XML format that specifically allows further annotation levels to be added at a later time without disrupting the structure of existing annotations. This allows the support of corpora with annotations generated by multiple tools in ANNIS.

Search The ANNIS server uses a relational database 2 that offers many advantages, including full Unicode support and regular expression searches. Extensive search functionalities are supported, based on nodes (individual word forms or annotations), and relations between these nodes, such as all forms of overlapping, contained or adjacent annotation spans, dominance axes (children, ancestors etc., as well as common parent, left-or right-most child and more), etc. Interface In the user interface, queries can be formulated using the ANNIS Query Language (AQL), which is based on the definition of nodes to be searched for and the relationships between these nodes (see below for some examples). A graphical query builder is also included in the web interface to make access as easy as possible (for a demo and some freely accessible corpora see the tutorial at: http://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/Annis/ ).

Visualization The web interface, realized as a window-based AJAX application written in Java, provides visualization facilities for search results. Available visualizations include token-based annotations, layered grid annotations, tree-like annotations (directed acyclic graphs), and a discourse view of entire texts for, among other things, coreference annotation. Multimodal data is represented using an embedded media player.

Special features Metadata can be used as a search criterion (in the form of feature-value pairs, e.g. speaker gender: female), and is accessible via an info button in the visualization. By allowing queries on multiple, conflicting annotations simultaneously, the system supports the study of interdependencies between a potentially limitless variety of annotation levels. At the same time, ANNIS allows us to integrate and to search through heterogeneous resources by means of a unified interface, a powerful query language, and an intuitive graphical query editor. It is therefore especially well-suited for the purpose of language documentation. In particular, ANNIS can serve as a tool for the publication of data collections via the Internet. A fine-grained user management allows granting privileged users access to specific data collections, as well as the option of either making a corpus available to the public, or sealing (but preserving) a resource until, for example, legal issues (such as copyright issues) are settled. This also makes it possible to publish linguistic data collections without exposing them to downloading. Moreover, ANNIS supports deep links to corpora and corpus queries. This means that queries and query results referred to in, for example, a scientific paper, can be reproduced and quoted by means of permanent links for as long as the server is operated and the respective corpus version is persistent. 5.2 Using ANNIS: an example query As an illustration for the application of ANNIS to the data collections presented above, consider a research question previously discussed in the study of object focus in Hausa.
 In Hausa, object focus can be realized in two ways: either ex-situ or in-situ (cf. Sect. 3.2 ). It was found that these realizations do not differ in their semantic type (Green and Jaggar 2003 , Hartmann and Zimmermann 2007b ); instead, the marked form signals that the focused constituent (or the whole speech act) is unexpected for the hearer (Zimmermann 2008 ). These assumptions are consistent with findings for other African languages (Fiedler 2009 ). In order to verify such claims on corpora with morphosyntactic and syntactic annotation for the example of Hausa, a corpus query can be designed on the basis of the Hausar Baka corpus. This corpus comprises not only annotations for grammatical functions and IS categories, but also an annotation of ex-situ elements. So, in (2), we look for ex-situ constituents (variable #1 ) in declarative sentences in the Hausar Baka corpus, i.e., sentences that are not translated as questions (variable #2 ) such that #2 includes #1  X  #2 i #1  X  . Example 2 EX -SITU  X   X  X   X   X  X  &amp; TRANSLATION  X  =:  X  ^? = &amp;#2 i #1
Considering the first 25 matches for this query on Hausar Baka, 16 examples appear to be relevant (excluding interrogative pronouns and elliptical utterances). All of these are directly preceded by a period (sentence-initial) or a comma (preceded by ee  X  X es X , interjections or exclamations), with one exception, where the preceding element is a sentence initial negation marker. Seven examples are morphologically marked by focus particles ( nee , cee ), focus-sensitive adverbs ( kawa  X  i  X  X nly X ) or quantifiers ( koomee  X  X very X ). In nine cases, a personal pronoun follows the ex-situ constituent, followed by the verb. Together, these constraints describe all examples retrieved, and as a generalization, we can now postulate a number of patterns that only make use of morphosyntactic and syntactic annotation (token tok; morphological segmentation MORPH; part of speech CLASS; nominal chunks CHUNK) 3 with two examples given below: Example 3 tok  X  =  X  ;: !? = &amp; CHUNK  X   X  X  NC  X  X  &amp; MORPH  X  =  X  cn ee = &amp;#1 : #2 &amp;#2 : #3 Example 4 tok  X  =  X  ;: !? = &amp; CHUNK  X   X  X  NC  X  X  &amp; CLASS  X  = PRON : = &amp; CLASS  X   X  X  V  X  X  &amp;#1 : #2 &amp; #2 : #3 &amp; #3 : #4
In (3), we search for a nominal chunk following a punctuation sign and preceding a focus particle ( cee or nee ); in (4), we search for a nominal chunk preceding a sequence of a pronoun/aspect marker and verb. One example matching template (4) from the Hausar Baka corpus is given in Fig. 2 . AQL can be used in this way to help understand the grammatical realization of certain phenomena, and the context in which they occur. However, patterns like (4) above are easier to interpret if presented graphically. Therefore, ANNIS includes a graphical query builder that allows users to create AQL queries in a more intuitive way, cf. Fig. 3 . These patterns are not exhaustive and they overgenerate. They can, however, be directly evaluated against the manual ex-situ annotation in the Hausar Baka corpus and further refined. The manual annotation of ex-situ constituents in the Hausar Baka corpus provides patterns for the semi-automatic detection of ex-situ constituents in a morphosyntactically annotated corpus of Hausa: the patterns generate a set of candidate examples from which a human annotator can then choose real ex-situ constituents. Indeed, for a better understanding of ex-situ object focus, a study with a larger database comprising more natural language expressions would be of a great advantage, and this pattern-based approach represents a way to create such a database. Finally, it would also help in finding instances of predicate focus. When a V(P) constituent is focused in Hausa, it is nominalized and fronted like a focused nominal constituent (Hartmann and Zimmermann 2007a , b ).
 5.3 Related corpus tools Some annotation tools come with search facilities, e.g., Toolbox (Busemann and Busemann 2008 ), a system for annotating, managing, and analyzing language data, mainly geared to lexicographic use, and ELAN (Hellwig et al. 2008 ), an annotation tool for audio and video data. Both Toolbox and ELAN (as well as the other annotation tools used within the CRC) are problem-specific annotation tools: Toolbox provides an intuitive annotation environment and search facilities for flat, word-oriented annotations; ELAN, on the other hand, for annotations that stand in a temporal relation to each other. Neither of them, however, is capable of sufficiently representing data from all other tools. Annotation of different structures and on multiple levels is crucial for the investigation of information structural phenomena. In order to fill this gap, ANNIS was designed. It is not intended to provide annotation functionality, but to visualize and query multi-layer annotations. In particular, ANNIS allows for the integration of annotations originating from different tools (e.g., syntax trees created with Synpathy or annotate, coreference annotation created with MMAX2, and flat, time-aligned annotations created with ELAN) that nevertheless refer to the same primary data .

In this respect, ANNIS, together with the data format PAULA, as well as the libraries created to work with both, is best compared to general annotation frameworks such as ATLAS, NITE, and LAF. Taking the NITE XML Toolkit (NXT) as a representative example for this kind of framework, it provides an abstract data model, XML-based formats for data storage and metadata, a query language, and a library with JAVA routines for data storage and manipulation, querying and visualization. Additionally, a set of command line tools and simple interfaces for corpus querying and browsing are provided, which illustrates how the libraries can be used to create one X  X  own, project-specific corpus interfaces and tools. Similar to ANNIS, NXT supports time-aligned, hierarchical and pointer-based annotation, conflicting hierarchies and the embedding of multi-modal primary data. The data storage format is based on the bundling of multiple XML files similar to the standoff concept employed in LAF and PAULA. One fundamental difference between NXT and ANNIS, however, is to be seen in the primary clientele it targets: The NITE XML Toolkit is aimed at the developer and allows to build more specialized displays, interfaces, and analyses as required by their respective end users when working with highly structured data annotated on multiple levels. As compared to work with a particular set of corpora. Therefore, an important and notable aspect of the ANNIS implementation is the integration with a database and the convenient means for visualization and querying. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we described the Africanist projects of the CRC 632 Information Structure at the University of Potsdam and Humboldt University of Berlin in Germany, together with their data collections from currently 25 sub-Saharan languages. We have also presented the linguistic database ANNIS, which can be used to publish, access, query and visualize these data collections. As one specific example of our work, we have described the design and ongoing construction of a corpus of written Hausa, the Hausa internet corpus, discussed the relevant NLP techniques for (semi-)automatic morphosyntactic annotation, and the application of the ANNIS Query Language to filter out ex-situ constituents and their contexts, which are relevant with regard to our goal, a better understanding of focus and information structure in Hausa and other African languages.
