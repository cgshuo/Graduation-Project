 Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented growth in the amount of digital information avail-able on the Internet. Flickr, one of the best known photo sharing websites, hosts more than three bil-lion images, with approximately 2.5 million im-ages being uploaded every day. 1 Many on-line news sites like CNN, Yahoo!, and BBC publish images with their stories and even provide photo feeds related to current events. Browsing and find-ing pictures in large-scale and heterogeneous col-lections is an important problem that has attracted much interest within information retrieval.

Many of the search engines deployed on the web retrieve images without analyzing their con-tent, simply by matching user queries against col-located textual information. Examples include meta-data (e.g., the image X  X  file name and for-mat), user-annotated tags, captions, and gener-ally text surrounding the image. As this limits the applicability of search engines (images that do not coincide with textual data cannot be re-trieved), a great deal of work has focused on the development of methods that generate description words for a picture automatically . The literature is littered with various attempts to learn the as-sociations between image features and words us-ing supervised classification (Vailaya et al., 2001; Smeulders et al., 2000), instantiations of the noisy-channel model (Duygulu et al., 2002), latent vari-able models (Blei and Jordan, 2003; Barnard et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2009), and models inspired by information retrieval (Lavrenko et al., 2003; Feng et al., 2004).

In this paper we go one step further and gen-erate captions for images rather than individual keywords. Although image indexing techniques based on keywords are popular and the method of choice for image retrieval engines, there are good reasons for using more linguistically meaningful descriptions. A list of keywords is often ambigu-ous. An image annotated with the words blue , sky , car could depict a blue car or a blue sky, whereas the caption  X  car running under the blue sky  X  would make the relations between the words explicit. Automatic caption generation could im-prove image retrieval by supporting longer and more targeted queries. It could also assist journal-ists in creating descriptions for the images associ-ated with their articles. Beyond image retrieval, it could increase the accessibility of the web for vi-sually impaired (blind and partially sighted) users who cannot access the content of many sites in the same ways as sighted users can (Ferres et al., 2006).

We explore the feasibility of automatic caption generation in the news domain, and create descrip-tions for images associated with on-line articles. Obtaining training data in this setting does not re-quire expensive manual annotation as many ar-ticles are published together with captioned im-ages. Inspired by recent work in summarization, we propose extractive and abstractive caption gen-eration models. The backbone for both approaches is a probabilistic image annotation model that sug-gests keywords for an image. We can then simply identify (and rank) the sentences in the documents that share these keywords or create a new caption that is potentially more concise but also informa-tive and fluent. Our abstractive model operates over image description keywords and document phrases. Their combination gives rise to many caption realizations which we select probabilisti-cally by taking into account dependency and word order constraints. Experimental results show that the model X  X  output compares favorably to hand-written captions and is often superior to extractive methods. Although image understanding is a popular topic within computer vision, relatively little work has focused on the interplay between visual and lin-guistic information. A handful of approaches gen-erate image descriptions automatically following a two-stage architecture. The picture is first ana-lyzed using image processing techniques into an abstract representation, which is then rendered into a natural language description with a text gen-eration engine. A common theme across differ-ent models is domain specificity, the use of hand-labeled data, and reliance on background ontolog-ical information.

For example, H  X  ede et al. (2004) generate de-scriptions for images of objects shot in uniform background. Their system relies on a manually created database of objects indexed by an image signature (e.g., color and texture) and two key-words (the object X  X  name and category). Images are first segmented into objects, their signature is retrieved from the database, and a description is generated using templates. Kojima et al. (2002, 2008) create descriptions for human activities in office scenes. They extract features of human mo-tion and interleave them with a concept hierarchy of actions to create a case frame from which a nat-ural language sentence is generated. Yao et al. (2009) present a general framework for generating text descriptions of image and video content based on image parsing. Specifically, images are hierar-chically decomposed into their constituent visual patterns which are subsequently converted into a semantic representation using WordNet. The im-age parser is trained on a corpus, manually an-notated with graphs representing image structure. A multi-sentence description is generated using a document planner and a surface realizer.

Within natural language processing most previ-ous efforts have focused on generating captions to accompany complex graphical presentations (Mit-tal et al., 1998; Corio and Lapalme, 1999; Fas-ciano and Lapalme, 2000; Feiner and McKeown, 1990) or on using the captions accompanying in-formation graphics to infer their intended mes-sage, e.g., the author X  X  goal to convey ostensible increase or decrease of a quantity of interest (Elzer et al., 2005). Little emphasis is placed on image processing; it is assumed that the data used to cre-ate the graphics are available, and the goal is to enable users understand the information expressed in them.

The task of generating captions for news im-ages is novel to our knowledge. Instead of relying on manual annotation or background ontological information we exploit a multimodal database of news articles, images, and their captions. The lat-ter is admittedly noisy, yet can be easily obtained from on-line sources, and contains rich informa-tion about the entities and events depicted in the images and their relations. Similar to previous work, we also follow a two-stage approach. Us-ing an image annotation model, we first describe the picture with keywords which are subsequently realized into a human readable sentence. The caption generation task bears some resemblance to headline generation (Dorr et al., 2003; Banko et al., 2000; Jin and Hauptmann, 2002) where the aim is to create a very short summary for a doc-ument. Importantly, we aim to create a caption that not only summarizes the document but is also a faithful to the image X  X  content (i.e., the caption should also mention some of the objects or indi-viduals depicted in the image). We therefore ex-plore extractive and abstractive models that rely on visual information to drive the generation pro-cess. Our approach thus differs from most work in summarization which is solely text-based. We formulate image caption generation as fol-lows. Given an image I , and a related knowl-edge database  X  , create a natural language descrip-tion C which captures the main content of the im-age under  X  . Specifically, in the news story sce-nario, we will generate a caption C for an image I and its accompanying document D . The training data thus consists of document-image-caption tu-ples like the ones shown in Table 1. During test-ing, we are given a document and an associated image for which we must generate a caption.
 Our experiments used the dataset created by Feng and Lapata (2008). 2 It contains 3,361 articles downloaded from the BBC News website 3 each of which is associated with a captioned news image. The latter is usually 203 pixels wide and 152 pix-els high. The average caption length is 9.5 words, the average sentence length is 20.5 words, and the average document length 421.5 words. The caption vocabulary is 6,180 words and the docu-ment vocabulary is 26,795. The vocabulary shared between captions and documents is 5,921 words. The captions tend to use half as many words as the document sentences, and more than 50% of the time contain words that are not attested in the doc-ument (even though they may be attested in the collection).

Generating image captions is a challenging task even for humans, let alone computers. Journalists are given explicit instructions on how to write cap-tions 4 and laypersons do not always agree on what a picture depicts (von Ahn and Dabbish, 2004). Along with the title, the lead, and section head-ings, captions are the most commonly read words in an article. A good caption must be succinct and informative, clearly identify the subject of the pic-ture, establish the picture X  X  relevance to the arti-cle, provide context for the picture, and ultimately draw the reader into the article. It is also worth noting that journalists often write their own cap-tions rather than simply extract sentences from the document. In doing so they rely on general world knowledge but also expertise in current affairs that goes beyond what is described in the article or shown in the picture. As mentioned earlier, our approach relies on an image annotation model to provide description keywords for the picture. Our experiments made use of the probabilistic model presented in Feng and Lapata (2010). The latter is well-suited to our task as it has been developed with noisy, multi-modal data sets in mind. The model is based on the assumption that images and their surrounding text are generated by mixtures of latent topics which are inferred from a concatenated representation of words and visual features.

Specifically, images are preprocessed so that they are represented by word-like units. Lo-cal image descriptors are computed using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algo-rithm (Lowe, 1999). The general idea behind the algorithm is to first sample an image with the difference-of-Gaussians point detector at different scales and locations. Importantly, this detector is, to some extent, invariant to translation, scale, ro-tation and illumination changes. Each detected re-gion is represented with a SIFT descriptor which is a histogram of edge directions at different lo-cations. Subsequently SIFT descriptors are quan-tized into a discrete set of visual terms via a clus-tering algorithm such as K -means.

The model thus works with a bag-of-words rep-resentation and treats each article-image-caption tuple as a single document d Mix consisting of tex-tual and visual words. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA, Blei et al. 2003) is used to infer the latent topics assumed to have generated d Mix . The ba-sic idea underlying LDA, and topic models in gen-eral, is that each document is composed of a prob-ability distribution over topics, where each topic represents a probability distribution over words. The document-topic and topic-word distributions are learned automatically from the data and pro-vide information about the semantic themes cov-ered in each document and the words associated with each semantic theme. The image annotation model takes the topic distributions into account when finding the most likely keywords for an im-age and its associated document.

More formally, given an image-caption-document tuple ( I , C , D ) the model finds the subset of keywords W I ( W I  X  W ) which appro-priately describe I . Assuming that keywords are conditionally independent, and I , D are represented jointly by d Mix , the model estimates: W  X  I  X  arg max W t denotes a set of description keywords (the sub-script t is used to discriminate from the visual words which are not part of the model X  X  output), K the number of topics, P ( w t | z k ) the multimodal word distributions over topics, and P ( z k | d Mix ) the estimated posterior of the topic proportions over documents. Given an unseen image-document pair and trained multimodal word distributions over topics, it is possible to infer the posterior of topic proportions over the new data by maximizing the likelihood. The model delivers a ranked list of textual words w t , the n -best of which are used as annotations for image I .

It is important to note that the caption gener-ation models we propose are not especially tied to the above annotation model. Any probabilis-tic model with broadly similar properties could serve our purpose. Examples include PLSA-based approaches to image annotation (e.g., Monay and Gatica-Perez 2007) and correspondence LDA (Blei and Jordan, 2003). Much work in summarization to date focuses on sentence extraction where a summary is created simply by identifying and subsequently concate-nating the most important sentences in a docu-ment. Without a great deal of linguistic analysis, it is possible to create summaries for a wide range of documents, independently of style, text type, and subject matter. For our caption generation task, we need only extract a single sentence. And our guid-ing hypothesis is that this sentence must be max-imally similar to the description keywords gener-ated by the annotation model. We discuss below different ways of operationalizing similarity. Word Overlap Perhaps the simplest way of measuring the similarity between image keywords and document sentences is word overlap: where W I is the set of keywords and S d a sentence in the document. The caption is then the sentence that has the highest overlap with the keywords. Cosine Similarity Word overlap is admittedly a naive measure of similarity, based on lexical identity. We can overcome this by representing keywords and sentences in vector space (Salton and McGill, 1983). The latter is a word-sentence co-occurrence matrix where each row represents a word, each column a sentence, and each en-try the frequency with which the word appeared within the sentence. More precisely matrix cells are weighted by their tf-idf values. The similarity of the vectors representing the keywords document sentence suring the cosine of their angle: Probabilistic Similarity Recall that the back-bone of our image annotation model is a topic model with images and documents represented as a probability distribution over latent topics. Un-der this framework, the similarity between an im-age and a sentence can be broadly measured by the extent to which they share the same topic distribu-tions (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007). For example, we may use the KL divergence to measure the dif-ference between the distributions p and q : where p and q are shorthand for the image topic distribution P d bution P S the document sentence, we also take its neighbor-ing sentences into account to avoid estimating in-accurate topic proportions on short sentences.
The KL divergence is asymmetric and in many applications, it is preferable to apply a symmet-ric measure such as the Jensen Shannon (JS) di-vergence. The latter measures the  X  X istance X  be-tween p and q through ( p + q ) 2 , the average of p and q : JS ( p , q ) = Although extractive methods yield grammatical captions and require relatively little linguistic analysis, there are a few caveats to consider. Firstly, there is often no single sentence in the doc-ument that uniquely describes the image X  X  content. In most cases the keywords are found in the doc-ument but interspersed across multiple sentences. Secondly, the selected sentences make for long captions (sometimes longer than the average doc-ument sentence), are not concise and overall not as catchy as human-written captions. For these reasons we turn to abstractive caption generation and present models based on single words but also phrases.
 Word-based Model Our first abstractive model builds on and extends a well-known probabilistic model of headline generation (Banko et al., 2000). The task is related to caption generation, the aim is to create a short, title-like headline for a given doc-ument, without however taking visual information into account. Like captions, headlines have to be catchy to attract the reader X  X  attention.

Banko et al. (2000) propose a bag-of-words model for headline generation. It consists of con-tent selection and surface realization components. Content selection is modeled as the probability of a word appearing in the headline given the same word appearing in the corresponding document and is independent from other words in the head-line. The likelihood of different surface realiza-tions is estimated using a bigram model. They also take the distribution of the length of the headlines into account in an attempt to bias the model to-wards generating concise output:
P ( w 1 , w 2 ,..., w n ) = where w i is a word that may appear in head-line H , D the document being summarized, and P ( len ( H ) = n ) a headline length distribution model.

The above model can be easily adapted to the caption generation task. Content selection is now the probability of a word appearing in the cap-tion given the image and its associated document which we obtain from the output of our image an-notation model (see Section 4). In addition we re-place the bigram surface realizer with a trigram: where C is the caption, I the image, D the accom-panying document, and P ( w i  X  C | I , D ) the image annotation probability.

Despite its simplicity, the caption generation model in (7) has a major drawback. The content selection component will naturally tend to ignore function words, as they are not descriptive of the image X  X  content. This will seriously impact the grammaticality of the generated captions, as there will be no appropriate function words to glue the content words together. One way to remedy this is to revert to a content selection model that ig-nores the image and simply estimates the prob-ability of a word appearing in the caption given the same word appearing in the document. At the same time we modify our surface realization com-ponent so that it takes note of the image annotation probabilities. Specifically, we use an adaptive lan-guage model (Kneser et al., 1997) that modifies an n -gram model with local unigram probabilities:
P ( w 1 , w 2 ,..., w n ) = where P ( w i  X  C | w i  X  D ) is the probability of w i ap-pearing in the caption given that it appears in guage model adapted with probabilities from our image annotation model: where P back ( w | h ) is the probability of w given the history h of preceding words (i.e., the orig-inal trigram model), P ada p ( w ) the probability of w according to the image annotation model, P back ( w ) the probability of w according to the orig-inal model, and  X  a scaling parameter.
 Phrase-based Model The model outlined in equation (8) will generate captions with function words. However, there is no guarantee that these will be compatible with their surrounding context or that the caption will be globally coherent be-yond the trigram horizon. To avoid these prob-lems, we turn our attention to phrases which are naturally associated with function words and can potentially capture long-range dependencies.
Specifically, we obtain phrases from the out-put of a dependency parser. A phrase is sim-ply a head and its dependents with the exception of verbs, where we record only the head (other-wise, an entire sentence could be a phrase). For example, from the first sentence in Table 1 (first row, left document) we would extract the phrases: thousands of Tongans , attended , the funeral , King Taufa X  X hau Tupou IV , last week , at the age , died , and so on. We only consider dependencies whose heads are nouns, verbs, and prepositions, as these constitute 80% of all dependencies attested in our caption data. We define a bag-of-phrases model for caption generation by modifying the content selection and caption length components in equa-tion (8) as follows:
P (  X  1 ,  X  2 ,...,  X  m )  X  Here, P (  X  j  X  C |  X  j  X  D ) models the probability of phrase  X  j appearing in the caption given that it also appears in the document and is estimated as: P (  X  j  X  C |  X  j  X  D ) =  X  where w j is a word in the phrase  X  j .

One problem with the models discussed thus far is that words or phrases are independent of each other. It is up to the trigram model to en-force coarse ordering constraints. These may be sufficient when considering isolated words, but phrases are longer and their combinations are sub-ject to structural constraints that are not captured by sequence models. We therefore attempt to take phrase attachment constraints into account by es-timating the probability of phrase  X  j attaching to the right of phrase  X  i as:
P (  X  j |  X  i )=  X  where p ( w j | w i ) is the probability of a phrase con-taining word w j appearing to the right of a phrase containing word w i , f ( w i , w j ) indicates the num-ber of times w i and w j are adjacent, f ( w i ,  X  ) is the number of times w i appears on the left of any phrase, and f (  X  , w i ) the number of times it ap-pears on the right. 5
After integrating the attachment probabilities into equation (12), the caption generation model becomes: P (  X  1 ,  X  2 ,...,  X  m )  X  On the one hand, the model in equation (15) takes long distance dependency constraints into ac-count, and has some notion of syntactic structure through the use of attachment probabilities. On the other hand, it has a primitive notion of caption length estimated by P ( len ( C ) =  X  m j = 1 len (  X  j )) and will therefore generate captions of the same (phrase) length. Ideally, we would like the model to vary the length of its output depending on the chosen context. However, we leave this to future work.
 Search To generate a caption it is neces-sary to find the sequence of words that maxi-mizes P ( w 1 , w 2 ,..., w n ) for the word-based model (equation (8)) and P (  X  1 ,  X  2 ,...,  X  m ) for the phrase-based model (equation (15)). We rewrite both probabilities as the weighted sum of their log form components and use beam search to find a near-optimal sequence. Note that we can make search more efficient by reducing the size of the document D . Using one of the models from Sec-tion 5, we may rank its sentences in terms of their relevance to the image keywords and con-sider only the n -best ones. Alternatively, we could consider the single most relevant sentence together with its surrounding context under the assumption that neighboring sentences are about the same or similar topics. In this section we discuss our experimental design for assessing the performance of the caption gen-eration models presented above. We give details on our training procedure, parameter estimation, and present the baseline methods used for com-parison with our models.
 Data All our experiments were conducted on the corpus created by Feng and Lapata (2008), following their original partition of the data (2,881 image-caption-document tuples for train-ing, 240 tuples for development and 240 for test-ing). Documents and captions were parsed with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) in order to obtain dependencies for the phrase-based abstractive model.
 Model Parameters For the image annotation model we extracted 150 (on average) SIFT fea-tures which were quantized into 750 visual terms. The underlying topic model was trained with 1,000 topics using only content words (i.e., nouns, verbs, and adjectives) that appeared no less than five times in the corpus. For all models discussed here (extractive and abstractive) we report results with the 15 best annotation key-words. For the abstractive models, we used a trigram model trained with the SRI toolkit on a newswire corpus consisting of BBC and Yahoo! news documents (6.9 M words). The attachment probabilities (see equation (14)) were estimated from the same corpus. We tuned the caption length parameter on the development set using a range of [ 5 , 14 ] tokens for the word-based model and [ 2 , 5 ] phrases for the phrase-based model. Fol-lowing Banko et al. (2000), we approximated the length distribution with a Gaussian. The scaling parameter  X  for the adaptive language model was also tuned on the development set using a range of [0.5,0.9]. We report results with  X  set to 0.5. For the abstractive models the beam size was set to 500 (with at least 50 states for the word-based model). For the phrase-based model, we also ex-perimented with reducing the search scope, ei-ther by considering only the n most similar sen-tences to the keywords (range [ 2 , 10 ] ), or simply the single most similar sentence and its neighbors (range [ 2 , 5 ] ). The former method delivered better results with 10 sentences (and the KL divergence similarity function).
 Evaluation We evaluated the performance of our models automatically, and also by eliciting hu-man judgments. Our automatic evaluation was based on Translation Edit Rate (TER, Snover et al. 2006), a measure commonly used to evaluate the quality of machine translation output. TER is de-fined as the minimum number of edits a human would have to perform to change the system out-put so that it exactly matches a reference transla-tion. In our case, the original captions written by the BBC journalists were used as reference: where E is the hypothetical system output, E r the reference caption, and N r the reference length. The number of possible edits include insertions (Ins), deletions (Del), substitutions (Sub) and shifts (Shft). TER is similar to word error rate, the only difference being that it allows shifts. A shift moves a contiguous sequence to a different location within the the same system output and is counted as a single edit. The perfect TER score is 0, however note that it can be higher than 1 due to insertions. The minimum translation edit align-Table 2: TER results for extractive, abstractive models, and lead sentence baseline;  X  : sig. dif-ferent from lead sentence;  X  : sig. different from KL and JS divergence. ment is usually found through beam search. We used TER to compare the output of our extractive and abstractive models and also for parameter tun-ing (see the discussion above).

In our human evaluation study participants were presented with a document, an associated image, and its caption, and asked to rate the latter on two dimensions: grammaticality (is the sentence flu-ent or word salad?) and relevance (does it de-scribe succinctly the content of the image and doc-ument?). We used a 1 X 7 rating scale, participants were encouraged to give high ratings to captions that were grammatical and appropriate descrip-tions of the image given the accompanying docu-ment. We randomly selected 12 document-image pairs from the test set and generated captions for them using the best extractive system, and two ab-stractive systems (word-based and phrase-based). We also included the original human-authored caption as an upper bound. We collected ratings from 23 unpaid volunteers, all self reported native English speakers. The study was conducted over the Internet. Table 2 reports our results on the test set us-ing TER. We compare four extractive models based on word overlap, cosine similarity, and two probabilistic similarity measures, namely KL and JS divergence and two abstractive models based on words (see equation (8)) and phrases (see equa-tion (15)). We also include a simple baseline that selects the first document sentence as a caption and show the average caption length (AvgLen) for each model. We examined whether performance differences among models are statistically signifi-cant, using the Wilcoxon test.
 KL Divergence 6.42  X   X  4.10  X   X  Abstract Words 2.08  X  3.20  X  Abstract Phrases 4.80  X  4.96  X  Gold Standard 6.39  X   X  5.55  X  Table 3: Mean ratings on caption output elicited by humans;  X  : sig. different from word-based abstractive system;  X : sig. different from phrase-based abstractive system.
 As can be seen the probabilistic models (KL and JS divergence) outperform word overlap and co-sine similarity (all differences are statistically sig-nificant, p &lt; 0 . 01). 6 They make use of the same topic model as the image annotation model, and are thus able to select sentences that cover com-mon content. They are also significantly better than the lead sentence which is a competitive base-line. It is well known that news articles are written so that the lead contains the most important infor-mation in a story. 7 This is an encouraging result as it highlights the importance of the visual infor-mation for the caption generation task. In general, word overlap is the worst performing model which is not unexpected as it does not take any lexical variation into account. Cosine is slightly better but not significantly different from the lead sen-tence. The abstractive models obtain the best TER scores overall, however they generate shorter cap-tions in comparison to the other models (closer to the length of the gold standard) and as a result TER treats them favorably, simply because the number of edits is less. For this reason we turn to the re-sults of our judgment elicitation study which as-sesses in more detail the quality of the generated captions.

Recall that participants judge the system out-put on two dimensions, grammaticality and rele-vance. Table 3 reports mean ratings for the out-put of the extractive system (based on the KL di-vergence), the two abstractive systems, and the human-authored gold standard caption. We per-formed an Analysis of Variance (A NOVA ) to ex-amine the effect of system type on the generation task. Post-hot Tukey tests were carried out on the mean of the ratings shown in Table 3 (for gram-maticality and relevance). Table 4: Captions written by humans (G) and gen-erated by extractive (KL), word-based abstractive (A W ), and phrase-based extractive (A P systems).
The word-based system yields the least gram-matical output. It is significantly worse than the phrase-based abstractive system (  X  &lt; 0 . 01), the extractive system (  X  &lt; 0 . 01), and the gold stan-dard (  X  &lt; 0 . 01). Unsurprisingly, the phrase-based system is significantly less grammatical than the gold standard and the extractive system, whereas the latter is perceived as equally grammatical as the gold standard (the difference in the means is not significant). With regard to relevance, the word-based system is significantly worse than the phrase-based system, the extractive system, and the gold-standard. Interestingly, the phrase-based system performs on the same level with the hu-man gold standard (the difference in the means is not significant) and significantly better than the ex-tractive system. Overall, the captions generated by the phrase-based system, capture the same content as the human-authored captions, even though they tend to be less grammatical. Examples of system output for the image-document pairs shown in Ta-ble 1 are given in Table 4 (the first row corresponds to the left picture (top row) in Table 1, the second row to the right picture, and so on). We have presented extractive and abstractive mod-els that generate image captions for news articles. A key aspect of our approach is to allow both the visual and textual modalities to influence the generation task. This is achieved through an im-age annotation model that characterizes pictures in terms of description keywords that are subse-quently used to guide the caption generation pro-cess. Our results show that the visual information plays an important role in content selection. Sim-ply extracting a sentence from the document often yields an inferior caption. Our experiments also show that a probabilistic abstractive model defined over phrases yields promising results. It generates captions that are more grammatical than a closely related word-based system and manages to capture the gist of the image (and document) as well as the captions written by journalists.

Future extensions are many and varied. Rather than adopting a two-stage approach, where the im-age processing and caption generation are carried out sequentially, a more general model should in-tegrate the two steps in a unified framework. In-deed, an avenue for future work would be to de-fine a phrase-based model for both image annota-tion and caption generation. We also believe that our approach would benefit from more detailed linguistic and non-linguistic information. For in-stance, we could experiment with features related to document structure such as titles, headings, and sections of articles and also exploit syntactic infor-mation more directly. The latter is currently used in the phrase-based model by taking attachment probabilities into account. We could, however, im-prove grammaticality more globally by generating a well-formed tree (or dependency graph).
