 Most knowledge repositories fo cus on the role of knowledge-creators. In this paper, by contrast, we examined the work of Lurkers in an enterprise file-s haring service, and we compared their lurking behaviors to the lurking behaviors of users who uploaded files (Uploaders), and users who contributed metadata about files (Contributors). For comparability, we restricted our analyses to the consuming behaviors that are common to the three roles (Uploaders, Contributors, and Lurkers). Independent principal components analysis show ed highly similar seven-factor solutions of lurking activities ac ross all three roles, although the relative emphases of those factor s varied across roles. Uploaders tended to view and download more groups of files, showed less emphasis on searching for files, and tended to work directly with the file-sharing application, unmedi ated by external applications. Contributors showed the opposite pattern: more emphasis on searching and responding to reco mmendations from other users, often via a form of remote access. Lurkers X  lurking behaviors were less intense, and showed little difference in emphases among the lurker factors. We use these results, and the published research literature, to motivate a research agenda for lurkers in social media. H5.3. Group &amp; Organizati onal Interfaces: CSCW. Human factors Collective intelligence, Lurker, Non-public participant, Social software, Social me dia, File-sharing Most analyses of knowledge repositories focus on the role of knowledge-creators. Users who do not contribute knowledge are usually termed "Lurkers," and are sometimes called "free-loaders" because they take information from the shared resource, but do not contribute anything in return [6, 8] . There are several reasons now to question this perspective [2]. 
In most social software applications, lurkers are the modal class of users [13, 18, 21]). By de finition, lurkers consume the information in the application. Of course, the more active, public users also consume the shared in formation. Thus, the consuming behaviors of lurkers are also part of the larger repertoire of users who also create the information that is consumed by everyone. In this sense, we are all lurkers, at least some of the time, in most of the social systems that we use. Studies, designs, and evaluations that benefit lurkers will also benefit the consuming behaviors of other classes of users. In the business research literature, recent reports by Li and Bernoff [13], McDermott [14], and Porter [23] have highlighted the commercial importance of user s who do not create primary content. When lurking behavior is measured properly, it can be a resource for indirect contributions . A log of which resources are consumed can provide evidence of the usefulness and perceived value of each resource. A summary of search terms can give an idea of what people are interested in. This kind of information can help knowledge-creators to serve the needs of their readers, and can help an organization to anticipate future needs. Within CHI and CSCW, the work of Preece and colleagues [19, 20, 24], and of Tahakashi et al. [32], has shown the motivations and subtle contributions of lurk ers, or "non-public participants" [19]. For example, some lurkers decline to contribute for altruistic reasons, preferring not to clutter an already-filled shared information space. Lurkers may also feel that they lack the standing or authority to make contributions [2, 11, 19, 26, 31]. In a partially-convergent resear ch programme, Takahashi et al. explored how  X  X ctive lurkers X  first find information from the shared resource, and then carry the information outside of the shared resource and application, to share it with other, indirect users [32]. In these ways, lurkers add to the effectiveness and the  X  X each X  of the knowledge-creators and of the shared repository as-Jonathan Feinberg is now at Google. a-whole, through increasing the number of people who are influenced by the information in the shared resource. However, Lurkers have received relatively little quantitative study (for exceptions, see [2, 27, 29, 31]. Lurkers have remained largely  X  X ilent X  [28] and  X  X nvisible X  [31], because data collection in most production systems focuses on th e activities of information-creators. It is possible to  X  X nstrument X  a system so that it records details of both creation (e.g., upload, modify, etc.) and consumption (e.g., view, download, search). We report on findings from that kind of instrumentation. This paper builds on previous research through a quantitative comparison of the usage patterns of lurkers and other user roles, in an enterprise file-sharing service called Cattail [16, 17]. We use these results to motivate a research agenda focused on lurkers and lurking behaviors in social software. Our agenda proposes a new direction, in distinction to prev ious proposals [2, 19, 20, 24, 27, 32]. Rather than assuming that lurkers will eventually become more public participants (e.g., [13, 25, 29, 30, 31]), we focus on lurkers as lurkers in organizations (e.g., [2, 11, 27, 28]. We consider their needs as a distinct group of users, some of whom may become experts in their role as lurkers. In the remainder of this paper, we introduce the Cattail File-Sharing Service, focusing on the features that are relevant to the analyses in this paper. We th en develop research questions, and answer them through a principa l components analysis and an analysis of variance. We close w ith a proposed research agenda to continue the study of lurkers. We examined the activities of lurkers in a research prototype enterprise file-sharing system. Unlike most production services, this prototype had been instru mented to capture not only the conventional production events (upload, comment, tag, etc.) but also consumption events (download, view, search). The Cattail file-sharing system is a centralized service that allows users within an enterprise to share files, to create metadata about those files, to search for files, and to download files (Figure 1) [16, 17]. More specifically, user s may engage in the following types of activities:  X  Upload a file  X  Contribute metadata on a file:  X  Make use of a file or metada ta about the fi le (consume) employee privacy. A file in Cattail may be classified as public or private. A public file may be viewed or downloaded by any user. A private file may only be viewed or downloaded by users who have access to that file. Access is automatic for th e person who Uploads a file. For private files, access can be granted to other users through the action of Sharing the file to named users (the user operation of sharing performs two system opera tions: [a] it adds the shared-to user to the permissions list for the file, and [b] it notifies the shared-to user that s/he has access to the file, optionally with an informal message from the sharer). A view onto the sharing data for a file is shown in Figure 2. Any user with access to a file may share that file to any other user. An earlier report [17] provided an overall analysis of the pattern of activities in Cattail, including the following four activity patterns:  X  Uploading one or more files, and publicizing them to other  X  Annotating a file and monitoring it for actions by other users  X  Finding files that had been uploaded by others, and telling  X  Refinding one's own files Previous work has also examined the use of collections of files in Cattail [16], highlighting the work of creators of those collections, described as "information curators." Those two reports tended to focus on the activities of file creation and discussion (see also [12, 27, 28, 33, 34] for other studies of file-sharing systems). As with ma ny studies of social media, we paid little attention to the less vi sible activities of consuming --i.e., activities that do not contribute files to the shared repository, and that do not create visible meta data about those files. By contrast, in this report, we ta ke a closer look at consuming behaviors of all users in Cattail. Following the research and commercia l insights of [12, 13, 14, 23, 27, 28, 33, 34], we compared the consuming activities of three categories of users of Cattail (Table 1):  X  Lurkers never deliberately add information to the database,  X  Contributors do not upload files, but they do create Download 9 9 9 Share 9 9 Collect 9 9 Annotate 9 9 Tag 9 9 Upload 9  X  Uploaders create files in the service through upload Our dataset consisted of user actions in the Cattail enterprise file-sharing service during the period 26 November 2008 through 5 June 2009 (n=133708 users). There were 17982 (13.5%) Uploaders, 19103 (14.3%) Contributors, and 96623 (72.2%) Lurkers. These categorizations proceed from the broadest to the narrowest sets of behaviors. Thus , most of the 13.5% of Uploaders also produced metadata and also consumed files and metadata. Most of the 14.3% of Contributors also consumed, but none of the people in the Contributors category performed any Uploads. Finally, the 72.2% of Lurkers engaged only in consuming behaviors  X  i.e., Lurkers performed no Uploading or Contributing. In this paper, we wanted to co mpare Uploaders, Contributors, and Lurkers on a core set of behaviors that are common to people in all three categories. We therefore excluded from our analysis the unique behaviors of Uploading and Contributing, because Lurkers (of course) perform none of those behaviors. We restricted our analysis to consuming behaviors only, because people in all three categories were likely to consume from time to time. Our question thus becomes: Do users in different categories engage in different consuming behaviors ? This narrowing of focus led to a set of 18 consuming activities in our study (see Table 2). Using a principal components analysis, we asked: 
Research Question 1: What are the patterns of consuming behaviors? It seems likely that Uploaders e ngage in consuming behaviors in support of their uploading activities (e.g., determining which files are available, and then uploading new files to augment the set of shared information with new content). It also seems likely that Contributors engage in consuming behaviors in support of their contributing (e.g., finding file s to collect, share/recommend, annotate on, and/or tag). Th erefore, using the principal components analysis and an anal ysis of variance on the factors scores from that principal compone nts analysis, we examined the following hypotheses: 
Hypothesis 1: It seems likely that there will be different overall levels of consuming behaviors across the three different user roles of Uploaders vs. Contributors vs. Lurkers. 
Hypothesis 2: It seems likely that there will be different patterns of behaviors (distinct configurations of consuming actions, as compared with one another) across the three different user roles. A Note on Statistical Independence. One anonymous reviewer asked if the three role-based groups (Uploaders, Contributors, Lurkers) were really independent. Formally, the answer is  X  X es, X  because each user appeared in only one of the three groups. The anonymous reviewer suggested th at the occurrence of similar behaviors among all three groups rendered them non-independent. Our answer is that this is exactly our analytic strategy: To compare the patterns and extents of those common behaviors as distinguished by the role that each user chose to adopt. We restricted our analysis to co nsider only consuming behaviors. That way we could make direct comparisons among the user roles in the activities that all three roles engaged in. Using an ANOVA, we found that Uploaders were most active in their consuming behaviors, followe d by Contributors, and finally Lurkers (p&lt;.001 for 17 of the 18 variables). 2 supported. Hypothesis 2 predicted that the consuming behaviors of Uploaders might differ in their patterns fr om the consuming behaviors of Contributors, and that both might differ again from the consuming behaviors of Lurkers. To test th is hypothesis, we began a detailed investigation into Research Question 1 , i.e., the question of what patterns of consuming behavior occur in file-sharing. We conducted three separate princi pal components analyses on the consuming behaviors within three subsets of the data. One principal components analysis used consumption data from the 17982 Uploaders. A second princi pal components analysis used consumption data from the 19103 Contributors. A third principal components analysis used co nsumption data from the 96623 Lurkers. These analyses examined the 18 lurking-behavior variables in Table 2. For the 18 consuming behaviors, factors, the F (2,133705) as follows: Download, F=1043; Download-remote, F=32; ViewFile, F=5730; ViewFile-r emote-feed, F=88; ViewFile-remote-blog, F=1005; ViewFile-S hare-Email, F=3293; ViewFile-Version-Email, F=1861; ViewHo me-Date, F=4930; ViewHome-Type, F=386; ViewInbox, F= 5552; ViewOutbox, F=7072; ViewDyadSharedToMe, F=2263; ViewDyadSharedFromMe, F=2622; ViewOneCollection, F=6049; ViewAllCollections, F=6317; ViewPerson, F=10888; Vi ewPublic, F=79; Search, F=1175. All F tests were significant at p&lt;.001 or better. With the exception of Download-remote, all pairwise comparisons were significant at p&lt;.025 or be tter by Tukey HSD test. The goal of the principal components analysis is to provide a statistical description of whic h consuming behaviors are highly inter-correlated. Each resulting factor represents behaviors that tend to co-occur. Each of these factors, then, may be considered as an underlying driver, motivati on, or strategy of the observed consuming behaviors. In brief, all three principal com ponents analyses led to the same set of seven factors (using the criterion of eigenvalue &gt; 1.0). The seven factors were as follows:  X  Factor 1: Search + View summary metadata about a  X  Factor 2: Browse lists of Collections of Files + View  X  Factor 3: View files shared/recommended by  X  Factor 4: View files shared/recommended as a  X  Factor 5: Respond to emails that shared/recom- X  Factor 6: View information about another user and  X  Factor 7: View files via a remote access (i.e., By definition, a Lurker cannot create a recommendation. It could be argued that direct response to an email is outside the scope of a social file-sharing system, because it is substantially the same operation as file -transmission via email. We include this behavior in our analys is because (a) it is social (one user recom-mends or assigns a file to another), and (b) it is an act of consum-ing material that was initiated by another user. Note that the conclusions of the paper do not rest on this replacement-of-email behavior, but are based on the enti re set of consuming behaviors. Figure 3 presents a diagrammatic summary of the loadings of the consuming factors in the three analyses. We observed differences across the three user roles among the common patterns of consuming from the principal components analysis. These differences appear to reflect the fundamentally social nature of the use of this social file-sharing system:  X  In comparison to Lurkers, Uploaders had a slightly greater  X  Contributors tended to rely more on the actions of other  X  Lurkers appeared to engage more in social search , --i.e., The principal components analyses suggested differences in factor patterns across the three user roles. We used an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to clar ify these di fferences. Because the principal components analysis outcomes were so similar among the three groups of users (Figure 3), we pooled the data from all user roles into a single, omnibus principal components analysis, resulting in the same core factor structure that we described above (see the la rger, rectangles in Figure 3). We calculated a factor score for each user on each of the seven factor scores. We then compared the three user roles using a mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA on the three user roles and the seven factor scores. All effects were significant. Uploaders had highest scores on each of the seven factors, followed by Contributors, and finally Lurkers (F (2,133705) =14543.015, p&lt;.001, all pair-w ise differences significant at p&lt;.001 by Tukey HSD). Fact ors differed from one another (F (6,802230) =136.582, p&lt;.001, all pair-wise differences significant at p&lt;.002). More importantly, there was a significant Roles x Factors interaction (F (12,802230) =466.007, p&lt;.001, pair-wise differ-ences shown by standard error bars in Figure 4). Lurkers showed little differentiation among their factor sc ores. By contrast, Uploaders showed relatively high use of Factors 2 and 4 (use of Collect-ions and browsing Groups of files ), and relatively low use of Factors 1 and 7 ( Search+view+download and View-via-remote-access ). Contributors showed a very different pattern from Uploaders, with relatively low use of Factors 2 and 4, and relatively high use of Factors 1 and 7 and also Factor 5 (respond to Email recommendations ). It appears that Uploaders make their decisions to add new files based on groups of files (e.g., Collections), whereas Contributo rs make their decisions about sharing, collecting, commenting, tagging, etc., more socially, --i.e., in response to the recommenda tions of others. These patterns suggest that Uploaders may be less aware of an audience for their actions, as contrasted with Contributors. Overall, these results are in agreement with the qualitative finding that some users act as  X  X urators X  of Collections of file s, preparing those Collections for use by colleagues [16]; see also the  X  X pload and Publicize X  factor in [17], in which curators promote their own uploaded content to other users. By contrast, Contributors appear to be more reactive to the work somewhat reactive role, because s/he needs to find files in order to Contribute metadata to them (i.e., through the operations of Share, Collect, Annotate, and Tag). However, there is evidence that some people who act in the  X  X urator X  role of [16] are working primarily with files that were Uploaded by other users, as shown by the  X  X iscover and Tell X  factor in [17]. More generally, Li and Bernoff described actions of ra ting and commenting as distinct roles among users who do upload their own content [13]. Therefore, we might have expect ed Contributors to take more independent actions, w ith greater emphasis on searching, rather than on receiving recommendations from others. We will need to conduct further research to understand whether Contributors should be considered a single role, or whether there are distinct sub-patterns that distinguish di fferent forms of Contributing. The principal components anal ysis provided a quantitative description of the work of a larg e sample of consumption behavior across three user roles. We showed seven distinct factors that underlie the 18 observable consuming behaviors. Research Question 1 asked what patterns of consuming behavior occur among the users of the file-sharing service. The convergent principal components analyses s howed seven strong patterns of usage, including a core path of actions leading to a download operation, plus four distinct stra tegies for viewing files and the social data that describe those files, and two factors related to remote notification and remote access. Hypothesis 1 predicted that there would be different overall levels of activity across the three different user roles. We showed that this prediction was supported through ANOVAs on 17 of 18 consuming behaviors and all seve n factors, and again in the analysis of variance based on factor scores (Figure 4). Hypothesis 2 predicted that there would be different patterns of activity across the three different user roles, independently of the overall levels of activity that we had predicted in Hypothesis 1. The principal components analys is (Figure 3) and the ANOVA based on factor scores (Figure 4) showed strong contrasts in the ways in which the three user roles used various features of the file-sharing service. In contrast with Lurkers, Uploaders used more groups of files, and Contributors used more social recommendations based on individual files. We only examined one system, with one core type of shared the same patterns obtain in other social media, such as social-networking, and social-tagging, a nd in the sharing of other types of media. In addition, we will be interested to see if similar patterns occur in other organizational settings. Users in different roles engage in the same overall structure of consuming behaviors, as show n in the principal components analysis (Figure 3). However, each role is associated with a distinct pattern of relative em phasis among those factors (Figure 4). These observations suggest several design decisions. As we noted at the beginning of this paper, most social media systems are not instrumented to provide consumption data for analysis (i.e ., data about viewing information or about consuming information, for example downloa ding). Without such data, the work of lurkers will remain largely invisible, and the consumption behaviors in other roles will also be under-studied. We hope that the results in this paper will encour age others to collect such data (see also [21]). Part of our current work involves tools to make this kind of data-recording easier. We have described evidence of se veral distinct consuming strateg-ies. Uploaders tend to examine collections and groups of files, while Contributors tend to focus mo re on individual files. These results suggest different feature sets to support these different strategies. As suggested earlier [ 16], people who create collections of files may need better tools to describe and promote their collections. If there are different usage patter ns and strategies among the three user roles, should there be different user interfaces for users in each role? We recommend against this design choice, because of the overlap in behaviors across the user roles. Among the Upload-ers, 78% also Shared, 40% also Collected, 13% also Annotated, and 23% also Tagged. Thus, large percentages of Uploaders also engaged in the behaviors of Cont ributing. Similarly, among the Uploaders and Contributors, more than 94% viewed files in one way or another, more than 60% viewed files via a  X  X ome X  view, more than 22% viewed a list of files recommended to them, and more than 21% used the Collections-oriented views. Thus, large percentages of Uploaders and Contributors engaged in the behaviors that were also exhibited by Lurkers. The three user roles should theref ore be seen as subsets of one another, in which Uploaders make use of nearly all of the features of Cattail, Contributors make use of many of the features used by Uploaders, with greater emphasis on the social features, and Lurkers make use of a number of the features used by both Uploaders and Contributors. Providing separate user interfaces for each role would require Uploaders to shift among three systems, and would require Contributors to shift among two systems. The use of separate systems might discourage people from changing roles, which could ultimately reduce the number of Lurkers who decided to participate more fully in the role of Contributor or Uploader (see  X  X doption models, X  below). We use these results as a starting point for sketching a research agenda concerning the role of lu rkers in file-sharing and other social applications. First, we note that, while users in all roles engaged in some amount of consuming behavior, fully 72% of Cattail users did nothing other than consume (i.e., th e Lurkers). This pattern is not unusual in social media (e.g., [ 13, 18, 21]). Thus, Lurkers in Cattail and in many other social applications are the modal users. However, most design decisions are motivated by the needs of the more active,  X  X ublic X  user role s (Uploaders and Contributors), even though they constitute a minority of the user population. The results in this paper show that there is structure and (by inference) purpose in consumption behavior inherent in each of the different user roles, including Lurkers. A design decision that is responsive to the needs of lurkers has the potential to benefit 100% of the users, because all users consume at least some of the time. By contrast, for Cattail, a design decision that is responsive to the needs of Uploaders or Contributors will provide direct be nefits to at best 27% of the users of Cattail (although the Lu rkers may of course derive secondary benefit from anything that improves the use of Uploaders and Contributors). Thus , studies of the activities and needs of Lurkers have the potential to achieve the numerically greatest impact. In consequen ce, we propose to extend earlier work [2, 24, 25, 32] into a new research agenda on lurkers. As our principal components an alyses showed, the consuming activity of Lurkers is not a monolithic set of behaviors. Different people engage in up to seven di stinct patterns (factors) of consuming, and more than 96% of the users engaged in two or more of the seven patterns of consuming shown in the principal components analysis. Lurking can be a major component of a user X  X  work in an organization. One example is a customer-care agent, who digests information provided by researcher s and technologists in order to provide quality customer service (e .g., [32]). A second example is a corporate reference librarian, who becomes familiar with diverse literatures in order to assist clients in searches. A third example is a senior sponsor of online grou ps, who may quietly observe the activity of each team, harvesting insights for knowledge management  X  a form of  X  X xecutive lurking. X  5 We propose that Lurker-ethnographi es be conducted, not only for file-sharing, but for other systems that allow users to consume the shared resources. Studies on the motivations for lurking [2, 21, 24] provide a good starting point. New ethnographies should go further, to include organizational roles as well as motivations. We thank Elizabeth Daly for a discussion leading to this insight. Takahashi et al [32] reported that lurkers often share information outside of the system through which they obtained it. How do Lurkers choose which resources to share with others, external to the shared resource database? Do they approach the service with that purpose, or do they discover resources during the course of other activities, and then recognize the potential usefulness of those resources to other people w ho are not users of the original service and resource? What are their strategies in selecting resources? What are their strategies in sharing resources? Much research that considers Lurkers makes the assumption that they will --or should --become public participants. The socio-technographic ladder of the Gr oundswell project suggests a pro-gresssion that looks like a devel opmental or maturational model, going from inactive to lurking to contributing metadata to creat-ing core content [13] . Similar trajectories have been suggested in the  X  X eaders to leaders X  approach of Preece and Shneiderman [25], and in the  X  X e-lurking X  analyses of Rafaeli et al. [29, 31]. Others have suggested that the Lave and Wenger model of legitimate peripheral participation [11] c ould be used to explain the incremental development of a Lurker into a Contributor, and eventually into an Uploader [2 , 3, 21, 23, 29, 30, 31]. Does every Lurker share the goal of becoming an Uploader? Or are there separate and distinct developmental/maturational paths for Uploaders, for Contributors, and for Lurkers (i.e., as suggested in [2])? If there is evidence for a continuing separation among the three user roles, what organiza tional factors would account for such separate user roles? What tools would enhance performance and/or development for each of these models? How will the silent find a voice (e.g., [1, 15])? How will Lurkers X  needs become known in organizations? One solution is to survey the Lurkers (e.g., [19, 20, 32]). A second possibility is to help the Lurkers to self-organize as a community of people with common needs. Communities of practice often support a developmental path in which a member begins with small, simple actions as a newcomer, and gradually deepens her or his practice (and service to the community) by taking on more challenging tasks [4, 11]. What would the developmental path look like for a creators' (Uploaders X ) community? A Contributors' community? A Lurkers' community? How do a "master Uploader" and a "master Lurker" differ from one another? How would these communities of practice interact with one another? One of the commercial uses of information about lurkers takes the form of "attention data" [5, 9, 10]  X  i.e., relating a particular set of needs or interests to a particular market segment of users. What are the analogous opportunities within educational institutions, or within commercial enterprises, governments, and non-profits? Organizations often want to know how information and influence flow through their departments. Consuming is a key measure of both flow and value [2, 26], if we assume (per rational choice theory [22]) that employees make good decisions about what information to view or consume. Organizations can then construct  X  X usiness hypotheses X  that information should flow from Uploaders in one department, and be used by Lurkers in another department, and then organizations can test those hypotheses by examining patterns of Uploading and Lurking in the relevant departments. Organi zations may also wa nt to communicate certain information to selected groups of employees, based on the information that those em ployees are consuming. We believe that this paper makes four contributions: First, we have provided direct quantitative comparisons among three user roles in a large enterp rise social file-sharing system, namely Uploaders, Contributors, and Lurkers. These analyses support and inform earlier work to understand user roles in social software [13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 23, 25]. Second, we have made a detailed analysis of consuming behaviors that are common to those three ro les, showing seven factors that are relatively consistent across different user roles. These patterns can be tested for generality in other forms of social software. Third, we have used those seven factors to contrast the consuming behaviors within the three user roles in file-sharing. We have shown differences in those patterns of behavior, and we have proposed differences in strategies that could account for those different patterns. These results contribute to the on-going discussion of Lurkers X  goals and st rategies, and of the subtle ways in which Lurkers serve their organizations [2, 19, 20, 24, 25, 32], as well as more general discussions of how people use the data of others to create new forms of valu e [5, 11, 14, 28]. We have also translated those patterns into recommendations for design. Finally, we have used our results as a point of departure for a Lurker research agenda, continui ng the discussion begun in earlier proposals (e.g., [2, 24, 25]). A better understanding of how Lurkers serve the needs of collea gues and organizations will be important in meeting the needs of individuals and organizations [13, 14, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 32]. Preece and colleagues [19, 20, 24, 25] and Takahashi et al. [32] have shown the motivations and be nefits of Lurking. Li and Bernoff [13], McDermott [14], and Porter [23] have highlighted the commercial importance of Lurk ers. Now that we know that Uploaders, Contributors, and Lurkers engage in similar core patterns of consuming behaviors, we can see Lurking as a set of positions along the same behavioral axes as Uploading and Contributing. Research focused on Lurkers and Lurking can help to clarify the activities of all users, because similar patterns of consuming behaviors appear in all us er roles. We are all Lurkers. 1.
