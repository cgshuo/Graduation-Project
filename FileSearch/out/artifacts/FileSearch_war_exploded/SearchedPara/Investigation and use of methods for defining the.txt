 The translation from one language to another is considered that it was introduced as a o pment of this study has occurred. Nowadays, a number of machine translation tools malizing the natural languages. lation. In the work published by him in 1984  X  A framework of a mechanical translation between Japanese and English by analogy principle  X , he showed the tran s-Only after dividing them, he translated the sentence. As a result, he was able to create a whole sentence from the short fragments. By taking the samples and matching them by similarity degree he managed to find a new approach on language translation. T his method was called Example based Machine Translation [2]. the natural languages as a separate science. For instance, there are a number of avai l-tions given by an user, to match this question with questions in a database by finding formation filter technolog y and etc. steps of matching the knowledge fragments(requested fragments) with a prepared The process of comparing could be divided to the following methods of comparison:  X  Syntactic method;  X  Parametrical method;  X  Semantical method ; structure of two data are used to describe the fragment are compared. The example of take balanc e first of all the predicate X  X  names are compared, after that the arguments pairs are compared with each other. fragment for its partly balance(not full). During this process, usually it is necessary to study a structure of the known fragment. the idea of d istance between terms based on their likeness by the meaning or semantic ven X  X  been developed yet which compares by universal and mathematic method s. described not in symbols but by digits and signals used in neuron conditions. 1963 when Gerard Salten founded the Vector Space Model ( VSM) [ 3 ]. This method is input text) vector where input is represented as the s ame kind of vector as the texts. searches the samples from database which suits more than others, after that this set of matches are send to the second module for defining the similarity degree. In the sim i-larity calculation module, both modules are used at the same time to define the sim i-larity based on combined vectors calculated from the similarity. set the samples from database corresponding to the input and finding the sample most similar to the input . The quick search module is designed to solve these problems. base should be included in a table, then each sample formed from the word has to be words formed from the samples. This formation is shown on Figure 1 below The quick search process can be described as following: special number given for each word.
 Step 2.Analyzing the input sentence and produce the table of linked words. By using input sentence.

 separately, all id in this example are in ascending order set. The calculation of similarity degree for a main word include the following steps: Morphological degree of similarity (Word Overlap Measures) is used to calculate the words contained there is performed using the following formula: sentence x and the sample sentence y ; anumber of words in the sentence y(including all the punctuation marks).  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  (When he will arrive from the village)? corresponds to the A, whether B. based on this context. words has to be calculated as well. dering is set for each eleme nt. For instance, N is a directly ordered numbers and they of this string.

 C sentences is defined as following: tence y the following formula is used: TF_IDF is a statistical measure used to assess the importance of words in the context analysys and information search purposes. For instance, when the request comes it is the extend of suitability. This idea was introduced by Karen Spark Jones. It contains two parts: 1. Term Frequency  X  the ratio of the total number of terms(words) in a document to the number of input words. Thus, by the document we define the importance of a word : where  X  a total number of a terms in a document, and is a total number of all words containing in the document. 2. Inverse Document Frequency  X  inverse frequency of word occurance in a doc u-
IDF value for one separate term. where  X  the number of documents in the corpus It is not so important to calculate the base of the logarithm in the formula, because by increasing the base leads to increasing the weight of terms.
 Thus, TF -IDF is a measure that comes from multiplying two separate measures : During using the TF_IDF method in some cases take a high frequency for one document, and l o wer frequency in another documents .
