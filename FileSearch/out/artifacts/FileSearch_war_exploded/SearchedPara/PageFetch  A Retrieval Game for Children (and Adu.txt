Children often struggle with information retrieval tasks as searching for information often requires a developed vocab-ulary and strong categorisation skills; neither of which are particularly developed in children under the age of 12 [1]. In a study conducted by Druin etal [2], it was found that in an experimental setting many children are often uninter-ested in searching for information online or are only inter-ested in searching for information that is relevant to their personal interests. Consequently, children who were unmo-tivated were the least successful in completing information retrieval tasks in their study. It was suggested that a more e  X  ective means of engaging child participants in search stud-ies must be developed in order to gain further insights into the searching behaviours of children. To this end we have developed a game called PageFetch which aims to engage children (aged 8 to 80) in completing search tasks through a fun and interactive search-like interface.
 PageFetch is quite similar to other Human Computation Games developed in IR, i.e. PageHunt [3] and Fu-Finder [4], which have been used to improve search engines and study querying behavior, respectively. In these games, players are presented with a web page, and they need to enter in a query that retrieves the page. Players have three minutes to try and find as many of the pages as possible. However, Page-Fetch is novel, in a number of respects: (1) PageHunt and Fu-Finder used a similar set of pages (a mixture of hard and easy to find pages given Bing X  X  search engine at the time), in PageFetch pages from six di  X  erent categories were used (car-toons, music, sports, politics, actors and news) to provide a range of genres for children and adults 1 . (2) Thus, players are given a choice of category from which pages are presented (rather than random categories/pages). The choice of cate-gories provides more focused game play and lets players pick a genre that is of interest. (3) Unlike PageHunt, PageFetch assigns points according to how high the results page is re-turned (i.e. the higher the rank the more points), and unlike Fu-Finder, PageFetch uses only one search engine (Bing), as opposed to three. Finally, (4) PageFetch was designed to encourage players to focus on entering successful queries for each page, which is achieved by providing a X  X o pass X  bonus. If a player can find each page presented, regardless of how
