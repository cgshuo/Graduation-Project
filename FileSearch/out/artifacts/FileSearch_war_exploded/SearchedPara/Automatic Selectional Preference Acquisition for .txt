 Automatic acquisition of semantic information from corpora is a challenge for research on low-resourced languages, especially when semanti-cally annotated corpora are not available. Latin is definitely a high-resourced language for what con-cerns the number of available texts and traditional lexical resources such as dictionaries. Neverthe-less, it is a low-resourced language from a compu-tational point of view (McGillivray et al., 2009).
As far as NLP tools for Latin are concerned, parsing experiments with machine learning tech-niques are ongoing (Bamman and Crane, 2008; Passarotti and Ruffolo, forthcoming), although more work is still needed in this direction, espe-cially given the small size of the training data. As a matter of fact, only three syntactically an-notated Latin corpora are available (and still in progress): the Latin Dependency Treebank (LDT, 53,000 tokens) for classical Latin (Bamman and Crane, 2006), the Index Thomisticus Treebank (IT-TB, 54,000 tokens) for Thomas Aquinas X  X  works (Passarotti, 2007), and the PROIEL treebank (ap-proximately 100,000 tokens) for the Bible (Haug and J X ndal, 2008). In addition, a Latin version of WordNet  X  Latin WordNet (LWN; Minozzi, (2009)  X  is being compiled, consisting of around 10,000 lemmas inserted in the multilingual struc-ture of MultiWordNet (Bentivogli et al., 2004). The number and the size of these resources are small when compared with the corpora and the lexicons for modern languages, e. g. English.
Concerning semantic processing, no seman-tically annotated Latin corpus is available yet; building such a corpus manually would take con-siderable time and energy. Hence, research in computational semantics for Latin would benefit from exploiting the existing resources and tools through automatic lexical acquisition methods.
In this paper we deal with automatic acquisition of verbal selectional preferences (SPs) for Latin, i. e. the semantic preferences of verbs on their ar-guments: e. g. we expect the object position of the verb edo  X  X at X  to be mostly filled by nouns from the food domain. For this task, we propose a method inspired by Alishahi (2008) and outlined in an ear-lier version on the IT-TB in McGillivray (2009). SPs are defined as probability distributions over semantic features extracted as sets of LWN nodes. The input data are two subcategorization lexicons automatically extracted from the LDT and the IT-TB (McGillivray and Passarotti, 2009).

Our main contribution is to create a new tool for semantic processing of Latin by adapting compu-tational techniques developed for extant languages to the special case of Latin. A successful adapta-tion is contingent on overcoming corpus size dif-ferences. The way our model combines the syntac-tic information contained in the treebanks with the lexical semantic knowledge from LWN allows us to overcome some of the difficulties related to the small size of the input corpora. This is the main difference from corpora for modern languages, to-gether with the absence of semantic annotation. Moreover, we face the problem of evaluating our system X  X  ability to generalize over unseen cases by using text occurrences, as access to human linguis-tic judgements is denied for Latin.

In the rest of the paper we will briefly summa-rize previous work on SP acquisition and motivate our approach (section 2); we will then describe our system (section 3), report on first results and evalu-ation (section 4), and finally conclude by suggest-ing future directions of research (section 5). The state-of-the-art systems for automatic acqui-sition of verbal SPs collect argument headwords from a corpus (for example, apple , meat , salad as objects of eat ) and then generalize the observed behaviour over unseen cases, either in the form of words (how likely is it to find sausage in the object position of eat ?) or word classes (how likely is it
WN-based approaches translate the generaliza-tion problem into estimating preference probabil-ities over a noun hierarchy and solve it by means of different statistical tools that use the input data as a training set: cf. inter al. Resnik (1993), Li and Abe (1998), Clark and Weir (1999). Agirre and Martinez (2001) acquire SPs for verb classes instead of single verb lemmas by using a semanti-cally annotated corpus and WN.

Distributional methods aim at automatically in-ducing semantic classes from distributional data in corpora by means of various similarity measures and unsupervised clustering algorithms: cf. e. g. Rooth et al. (1999) and Erk (2007). Bamman and Crane (2008) is the only distributional approach dealing with Latin. They use an automatically parsed corpus of 3.5 million words, then calculate SPs with the log-likelihood test, and obtain an as-sociation score for each (verb, noun) pair.

The main difference between these previous systems and our case is the size of the input cor-pus. In fact, our dataset consists of subcatego-rization frames extracted from two relatively small treebanks, amounting to a little over 100,000 word tokens overall. This results in a large number of low-frequency (verb, noun) associations, which may not reflect the actual distributions of Latin verbs. This state improves if we group the obser-vations into clusters. Such a method, proposed by Alishahi (2008), proved effective in our case.
The originality of this approach is an incre-mental clustering algorithm for verb occurrences called frames which are identified by specific syn-tactic and semantic features, such as the number of verbal arguments, the syntactic pattern, and the semantic properties of each argument, i. e. the WN hypernyms of the argument X  X  fillers. Based on a probabilistic measure of similarity between the frames X  features, the clustering produces larger sets called constructions . The constructions for a verb contribute to the next step, which acquires the verb X  X  SPs as semantic profiles , i. e. probabil-ity distributions over the semantic properties. The model exploits the structure of WN so that predic-tions over unseen cases are possible. The input data are two corpus-driven subcate-gorization lexicons which record the subcatego-rization frames of each verbal token occurring in the corpora: these frames contain morpho-syntactic information on the verb X  X  arguments, as well as their lexical fillers. For example,  X  X o + A (in)Obj[acc] { exsilium }  X  represents an active occurrence of the verb eo  X  X o X  with a prepositional phrase introduced by the preposition in  X  X o, into X  and composed by an accusative noun phrase filled by the lemma exsilium  X  X xile X , as in the sentence 1 (1) eat We illustrate how we adapted Alishahi X  X  defini-tions of frame features and formulae to our case. Alishahi uses a semantically annotated English corpus, so she defines the verb X  X  semantic prim-itives, the arguments X  participant roles and their semantic categories; since we do not have such an-notation, we used the WN semantic information.
The syntactic feature of a frame ( f t 1 ) is the set of syntactic slots of its verb X  X  subcategoriza-tion pattern, extracted from the lexicons. In the above example,  X  X  (in)Obj[acc] X . In addition, the first type of semantic features of a frame ( f t 2 collects the semantic properties of the verb X  X  ar-guments as the set of LWN synonyms and hy-pernyms of their fillers. In the previous exam-ple this is { exsilium  X  X xile X , proscriptio  X  X roscrip-tion X , rejection , actio , actus  X  X ct X  } . 2 The second type of semantic features of a frame ( f t 3 ) col-lects the semantic properties of the verb in the form of the verb X  X  synsets. In the above example, these are all synsets of eo  X  X o X , among which  X  { eo , gradior , grassor , ingredior , procedo , prodeo , vado }  X  ( X  { progress , come on , come along , ad-vance , get on , get along , shape up }  X  in the En-glish WN). 3.1 Clustering of frames The constructions are incrementally built as new frames are included in them; a new frame F is as-signed to a construction K if F probabilistically shares some features with the frames in K so that
K = arg max where k ranges over the set of all constructions, including the baseline k 0 = { F } . The prior probability P ( k ) is calculated from the number of frames contained in k divided by the total number of frames. Assuming that the frame features are independent, the posterior probability P ( F | k ) is the product of three probabilities, each one corre-sponding to the probability that a feature displays in k the same value it displays in F : P i ( f t i ( F ) | k ) for i = 1 , 2 , 3 :
We estimated the probability of a match be-tween the value of f t 1 in k and the value of f t 1 in F as the sum of the syntactic scores between F and each frame h contained in k , divided the number n k of frames in k : where the syntactic score synt score ( h, F ) = tic slots shared by h and F over the number of slots in F . P ( f t 1 ( F ) | k ) is 1 when all the frames in k contain all the syntactic slots of F .

For each argument position a , we estimated the probability P ( f t 2 ( F ) | k ) as the sum of the seman-tic scores between F and each h in k : where the semantic score sem score ( h, F ) = tic properties S ( h ) of h (i. e. the LWN hyper-nyms of the fillers in h ) and the semantic prop-erties S ( F ) of F (for argument a ), over | S ( F ) | . where the synset score syns score ( h, F ) = overlap between the synsets for the verb in h and the synsets for the verb in F over the number of synsets for the verb in F . 3
We introduced the syntactic and synset scores in order to account for a frequent phenomenon in our data: the partial matches between the values of the features in F and in k . 3.2 Selectional preferences The clustering algorithm defines the set of con-structions in which the generalization step over unseen cases is performed. SPs are defined as semantic profiles, that is, probability distributions over the semantic properties, i. e. LWN nodes. For example, we get the probability of the node actio  X  X ct X  in the position  X  X  (in)Obj[acc] X  for eo  X  X o X .
If s is a semantic property and a an argument position for a verb v , the semantic profile P a ( s | v ) is the sum of P a ( s, k | v ) over all constructions k containing v or a WN-synonym of v , i. e. a verb contained in one or more synsets for v . P a ( s, k | v )
To estimate P a ( s | k, v ) we consider each frame h in k and account for: a) the similarity between v and the verb in h ; b) the similarity between s and the fillers of h . This is achieved by calculating a similarity score between h , v , a and s , defined as: where V ( h ) in (1) contains the verbs of h , N f il ( h, a ) counts the a -fillers in h , f ranges in the set of a -fillers in h , S ( f ) contains the semantic properties for f and | s  X  S ( f ) | is 1 when s appears in S ( f ) and 0 otherwise.

P a ( s | k, v ) is thus obtained by normalizing the sum of these similarity scores over all frames in k , divided by the total number of frames in k con-taining v or its synonyms.

The similarity scores weight the contributions of the synonyms of v , whose fillers play a role in the generalization step. This is our innovation with respect to Alishahi (2008) X  X  system. It was intro-duced because of the sparseness of our data, where Table 1: Constructions ( k ) for the frames ( h ) con-taining the verb introduco  X  X ring in X . many verbs are hapaxes, which makes the gener-alization from their fillers difficult. The clustering algorithm was run on 15509 frames and it generated 7105 constructions. Table 1 dis-plays the 5 constructions assigned to the 9 frames where the verb introduco  X  X ring in, introduce X  oc-curs. Note the semantic similarity between addo  X  X dd to, bring to X , immitto  X  X end against, insert X , induco  X  X ring forward, introduce X  and introduco , and the similarity between the syntactic patterns and the argument fillers within the same construc-tion. For example, finis  X  X nd, borders X  and ef-fectus  X  X esult X  share the semantic properties AT - X  X onscience X , EVENTUM  X  X vent X , among others.
The vast majority of constructions contain less than 4 frames. This contrasts with the more gen-eral constructions found by Alishahi (2008) and can be explained by several factors. First, the cov-erage of LWN is quite low with respect to the fillers in our dataset. In fact, 782 fillers out of 2408 could not be assigned to any LWN synset; for these lemmas the semantic scores with all the other nouns are 0, causing probabilities lower than the baseline; this results in assigning the frame to the singleton construction consisting of the frame itself. The same happens for fillers consisting of verbal lemmas, participles, pronouns and named entities, which amount to a third of the total num-ber. Furthermore, the data are not tagged by sense and the system deals with noun ambiguity by list-ing together all synsets of a word n (and their hy-pernyms) to form the semantic properties for n : consequently, each sense contributes to the seman-tic description of n in relation to the number of hypernyms it carries, rather than to its observed Table 2: Top 20 semantic properties in the seman-tic profile for ascendo  X  X scend X  + A (de)Obj[abl]. frequency. Finally, a common problem in SP ac-quisition systems is the noise in the data, including tagging and metaphorical usages. This problem is even greater in our case, where the small size of the data underestimates the variance and there-fore overestimates the contribution of noisy obser-vations. Metaphorical and abstract usages are es-pecially frequent in the data from the IT-TB, due to the philosophical domain of the texts.

As to the SP acquisition, we ran the system on all constructions generated by the clustering. We excluded the pronouns occurring as argument fillers, and manually tagged the named entities. For each verb lemma and slot we obtained a proba-bility distribution over the 6608 LWN noun nodes.
Table 2 displays the 20 semantic properties with the highest SP probabilities as ablative argu-ments of ascendo  X  X scend X  introduced by de  X  X own from X ,  X  X ut of X . This semantic profile was cre-ated from the following fillers for the verbs con-tained in the constructions for ascendo and its synonyms: abyssus  X  X byss X , fumus  X  X moke X , lacus  X  X ake X , machina  X  X achine X , manus  X  X and X , negoti-atio  X  X usiness X , mare  X  X ea X , os  X  X outh X , templum  X  X emple X , terra  X  X and X . These nouns are well repre-sented by the semantic properties related to water and physical places. Note also the high rank of general properties like actio  X  X ct X , which are asso-ciated to a large number of fillers and thus gener-ally get a high probability.

Regarding evaluation, we are interested in test-ing two properties of our model: calibration and discrimination. Calibration is related to the model X  X  ability to distinguish between high and low probabilities. We verify that our model is adequately calibrated, since its SP distribution is always very skewed (cf. figure 1). Therefore, the model is able to assign a high probability to a small set of nouns (preferred nouns) and a low probability to a large set of nouns (the rest), thus performing better than the baseline model, defined as the model that assigns the uniform distribution over all nouns (4724 LWN leaf nodes). Moreover, our model X  X  entropy is always lower than the base-line: 12.2 vs. the 6.9-11.3 range; by the maximum entropy principle, this confirms that the system uses some information for estimating the proba-bilities: LWN structure, co-occurrence frequency, syntactic patterns. However, we have no guaran-tee that the model uses this information sensibly. For this, we test the system X  X  discrimination po-tential, i. e. its ability to correctly estimate the SP probability of each single LWN node. Table 3: 15 nouns with the highest probabilities as accusative objects of dico  X  X ay X .
 Figure 1: Decreasing SP probabilities of the LWN leaf nodes for the objects of dico  X  X ay X .

Table 3 displays the 15 nouns with the highest probabilities as direct objects for dico  X  X ay X . From table 3  X  and the rest of the distribution, repre-sented in figure 1  X  we see that the model assigns a high probability to most seen fillers for dico in the corpus: anima  X  X oul X , corpus  X  X ody X , locus  X  X lace X , pars  X  X art X , etc.

For what concerns evaluating the SP probabil-ity assigned to nouns unseen in the training set, Alishahi (2008) follows the approach suggested by Resnik (1993), using human plausibility judge-ments on verb-noun pairs. Given the absence of native speakers of Latin, we used random occur-rences in corpora, considered as positive examples of plausible argument fillers; on the other hand, we cannot extract non-plausible fillers from a corpus unless we use a frequency-based criterion. How-ever, we can measure how well our system predicts the probability of these unseen events.

As a preliminary evaluation experiment, we randomly selected from our corpora a list of 19 high-frequency verbs (freq. &gt; 51) and 7 medium-frequency verbs (11 &lt; freq. &lt; 50), for each of which we chose an interesting argument slot. Then we randomly extracted one filler for each such pair from two collections of Latin texts ( Perseus Dig-ital Library and Corpus Thomisticum ), provided that it was not in the training set. The semantic score in equation 1 on page 3 is then calculated between the set of semantic properties of n and that for f , to obtain the probability of finding the random filler n as an argument for a verb v .
For each of the 26 (verb, slot) pairs, we looked at three measures of central tendency: mean, me-dian and the value of the third quantile, which were compared with the probability assigned by the model to the random filler. If this probabil-ity was higher than the measure, the outcome was considered a success. The successes were 22 for the mean, 25 for the median and 19 for the third found the success rate to be statistically significant at the 5% level. For example, table 3 and figure 1 show that the filler for dico +A Obj[acc] in the evaluation set  X  sententia  X  X udgement X   X  is ranked 13th within the verb X  X  semantic profile. We proposed a method for automatically acquiring probabilistic SP for Latin verbs from a small cor-pus using the WN hierarchy; we suggested some new strategies for tackling the data sparseness in the crucial generalization step over unseen cases. Our work also contributes to the state of the art in semantic processing of Latin by integrating syn-tactic information from annotated corpora with the lexical resource LWN. This demonstrates the use-fulness of the method for small corpora and the relevance of computational approaches for histor-ical linguistics.

In order to measure the impact of the frame clusters for the SP acquisition, we plan to run the system for SP acquisition without performing the clustering step, thus defining all constructions as singleton sets containing one frame each. Finally, an extensive evaluation will require a more com-prehensive set, composed of a higher number of unseen argument fillers; from the frequencies of these nouns, it will be possible to directly compare plausible arguments (high frequency) and implau-sible ones (low frequency). For this, a larger auto-matically parsed corpus will be necessary. We wish to thank Afra Alishahi, Stefano Minozzi and three anonymous reviewers.
