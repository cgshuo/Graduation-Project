 The Web can be represented by a directed graph where nodes stand for Web pages, and edges stand for hyperlinks among pages. There are about five more billions of nodes and edges on the today X  X  Web graph. Furthermore, the Web graph appears to grow exponentially as time goes by. Since the authors of the Web pages are with different background, culture, interest and education, they create, annotate and exploit the Web pages and hyperlinks in a variative way, which leads the Web graph structure to be a complex network. Research on structure of the Web graph could exploit the inherent useful information for link analysis and Web search.
 ent properties compared with the global Web graph from the structure to the evolution of the Web. The research on China Web graph will be useful for un-derstanding the evolution process of China Web graph, predicting the scale of the Web, improving the performance of Chinese Web page search engine, and processing Chinese Web information.
 nature, and then analyze the similarity and difference between the global Web graph and China Web graph. We verify power law distributions in China Web graph from several aspects. With our SCC algorithm, we outline the macro structure of the China Web both on Web graph level and site graph level. We also study the evolution of the China Web graph from the evolving of Web pages, link structure and the popularity of the pages.
 previous study work on the global Web graph and some regional Web graph. In Section 3, we describe our research result from a static snapshot of China Web graph. In Section 4, we present the studies on the evolution on China Web graph from several aspects. Finally we conclude in Section 5. In the area of Web graph analysis, [2] estimated the diameter of the Web. [8] [5] reported in-degree and out-degree distributions of the global Web graph fol-lowing the power law distributions, and they also analyzed the structure of the global Web graph. [3] focused the study on the Web site level of the global Web, measured the weighted degree sequences of the global site graph. [4] focused the study on the African Web, showing that the African Web graph appears different properties from the global Web graph. The maximal strongly connected compo-nent of the African Web graph is much bigger than the global Web graph and it points to lots of small strongly connected components. The work [7] is similar to ours, however, they just inferred the structure of the China Web graph by the structure properties of the global Web graph, making the result inadequate. lution of the Web from a search engine perspective. [6] study the popularity evolution of Web pages. In this section we first show the results on China Web graph measurements. Then we do experiments to validate the power law distribution phenomenon in China Web from several aspects. Finally we analyze the macro structure of the China Web graph and the China site graph. 3.1 Datasets In the experiment, we use the China Web graph dataset crawled by Peking University Sky Net search engine in May, 2003. The size of the raw data is nearly 300G, which contains hyperlinks from the source page to the destination page. Before the experiments, we preprocess the raw data to create the China Web graph and China site graph. After preprocessing, the invalid URLs are removed, each URL is assigned a unique ID. Finally the China Web graph is created, which contains 140 million pages and 4.3 billion links. Furthermore, we construct site graph as follows: each Web page belongs to a site, then the site connectivity also be represented as a directed graph, where sites are represented as nodes, edges are represented as connections between the sites. Also the directed graph is a weighted graph where the weight of the edges is the number of hyperlinks among sites. We create such a China site graph with 479 kilo nodes and 18 million edges. 3.2 Domain Distribution The domain number distribution presents differently from the global Web, from Table 1 we can notice .com accounts for most of the domain number and the .gov and .mil accounts for little. The statistic data indicates the development of World-Wide Web in China is not in balance, the World-Wide Web is used mostly for commerce in China and e-government needs to be further developed. 3.3 Power Law Distributions Previous work observed that various properties of the Web graph follow a power law distribution, which is defined on positive integers, with the probability of the value i being in proportion to 1 /i  X  for some constant  X &gt; 0. Degree Distributions. [11] shows that the fraction of Web pages with in-degree i is roughly proportional to 1 /i 2 . [1] reports an exponent of 2.1 for the in-degree distribution and they also show that the fraction of Web pages with out-degree i is roughly proportional to 1 /i 2 . 45 . In a recent paper [5] reported an in-degree exponent of 2.1 and an out-degree exponent of 2.72. The study on African Web [4] gives further evidence to the power law distribution, the in-degree of African Web pages with a exponent of 1.92. A previous research on China Web [7] also shows an in-degree distribution with an exponent 1.86. i is (roughly) proportional to 1 /i 1 . 62 and the fraction of sites of the site graph with weighted out-degree i is (roughly) proportional to 1 /i 1 . 67 . law distribution in China Web. Our experiments are carried both on China Web graph and China site graph.
 distribution of the China Web graph. Derived from the slope of the line providing the best fit to the data in the figures, in-degree and out-degree distribution with the exponent  X  =2 . 05 and  X  =2 . 62 respectively. Fig 3 and 4 show the weighted in-degree and weighted out-degree distribution of the China site graph with the exponent  X  =1 . 4 and  X  =1 . 5.
 property of the Web despite its dynamic characteristics.
 Page Number Distributions in Web Sites. We count the Web pages in every Web site and surprisingly observe that the number of Web pages in Web sites also follows power law distribution with the exponent  X  =1 . 74. This is another evidence that the Power Law distribution is a common phenomenon in Web graph. Fig 5 shows the distribution. PageRank Value Distribution. The PageRank algorithm is carried out on the China Web graph. As PageRank value is continuous, we discretized the PageRank value by equal-width binning with the bin size 0.005. We found that the pagerank values also follow a power law distribution. Fig 6 shows the distri-bution.
 Connected Components. A strongly-connected component is a set of pages such that for all pairs of pages ( u, v ) in the set, there exists a directed path from u to v . Previous studies note that the number of components, either weak or strong, of a given size also follow a power law distribution [9].
 exhibits a power law distribution with exponent  X  roughly 2.3. Fig 7 shows the distribution. 3.4 Connectivity of the China Web The graph structure of the China Web presents some differences from that of the global Web graph.
 to as a bow-tie [9]. This research is based on the crawl of Web pages in May 1999, which contains over 200 million pages and 1.5 billion links. The core of the figure, SCC, represents the largest strongly connected component of the graph. SCC contains 56 million pages. The left side of the bow-tie, named IN, represents the pages from which at least a path exists to some nodes in SCC. The right side of the bow-tie, named OUT, represents the pages which can be reached from some nodes in SCC. Both IN and OUT contain around 44 million pages respectively. IN can be viewed as the set of new pages that link to their interesting pages but not yet been discovered by SCC, while OUT can be viewed as some well known pages whose links point only internally. The TENDRILS contains pages that are reachable from IN, or that can reach OUT, without passages through SCC. The Web has not yet discovered these pages, and these pages do not link to better-known regions. TENDRILS include a surprisingly significant part of the pages, around 44 million.
 global Web. Fig 8 depicts the structure of China Web Graph. The China Web graph contains 140 million pages and 4.3 billion links. The SCC contains 112 million pages, the IN contains 16.5 million pages, the OUT contains 9 million pages, the TENDRILS and the disconnected components contain around 1 mil-lion pages respectively. The graph shows that around 80% Web pages are in the maximum SCC and if pages u and v are randomly chosen, the probability that there exists a path from u to v is around 4/5 according to this structure. The site graph totally contains 479 kilo Web sites, as we can notice in the figure that the number of sites in SCC accounts for about 2/3 of all the Web sites, indicating that most of the Web sites in China are connected to each other. The small fraction number of sites in IN implies that most of the Web sites in China are known by people and linked to by Web pages in other Web sites. In this section we show our experiment results in China Web evolution. 4.1 Data Collection In order to study the evolution of China Web graph, we have collected the tem-poral data from China Web, obtained a Web graph data sample periodically. Due to the limitation of the band width and storage, it is impossible for us to download the whole China Web graph each time, so we attempt to get a repre-sentative subgraph of the China Web graph as the dataset of our study. In our experiments, we select 150 Chinese Web sites, and crawl the Web pages from their home pages once a week, from May 2004 until June 2004, for a total 6 weeks. subgraph of the China Web graph to be selected should meet the following four characteristics: (1)covering a multitude of topics; (2)following domain distribu-tions; (3)with higher PageRank value; (4)can be accessed by existing network resource. 4.2 Weekly Birth Rate of Pages We first examine how many new Web pages are created every week. New Web page refers to the one which has not been downloaded before. We use the URL of a page as its identity, so if new URL emerged, we consider that a new page is created. The fraction of the new Web page represents the  X  X eekly birth rate X  of Web pages.
 the graph gives the average of all the values, representing the  X  X verage weekly birth rate X  of the pages. From the graph we can observe that the average weekly birth rate is about 9.8%, which is a little higher than the value 8%, the average weekly birth rate of global Web graph [10]. That is, 9.8% of pages downloaded in a weekly crawl had not been downloaded in any previous crawl. 4.3 Birth and Replacement of Pages In this experiment, we study how many new pages are created and how many disappear over time.
 week and the vertical axis shows the number of pages that we crawled during the given week. The bars are normalized such that the number of pages in the first is one. The dark bars represent the number of first week pages that were still available in the given week. The light bars represent the number of pages that exist in the given week but did not exist in the first week. For example, the number of pages in the second week in the 96% of the first week, and 82% of them already exist in the first week. The fluctuations in weekly crawl sizes are primarily due to the temporarily unavailable of the Web sites and the unreliable of the network connection. The normalized version of Fig 11 is shown in Fig 12. 4.4 Link Structure Evolution Link structure is useful information in measuring the importance of Web pages. Link analysis algorithms such as PageRank and HITS play an important role in the performance of search engine. In order to keep up with the changing importance of Web pages, it is important for search engines to capture the Web link structure accurately. In this experiment, we study how many links remain unchanged and how many new links are created.
 and the vertical axis represents the number of links in the given week. We nor-malize the vertical axis so that the number of links in the first week is 1. The height of every bar shows the total number of links in each snapshot relative to the first week. The dark-bottom portion represents the number of first-week links that still remain in the given week. The grey portion shows the number of new links in those pages that exist both in the first week and the given week. The white portion shows the number of links in those new pages that exist in the given week but not exist in the first week. Fig 14 shows a normalized figure where the total number of links in every snapshot is one. From the figure, we can notice that the link structure of the Web is more dynamic than the pages. On average there are 24.7% new links created every week. This result is a lit-tle greater than that of link structure evolution of global Web graph [10]. The dynamic of the link structure is an important characteristic of the Web graph, which implies that search engine may need to recalculate the link-based ranking value frequently. 4.5 Page Popularity Evolution In this experiment, we study the evolution of the page popularity. We will use two methods to estimate the popularity of a page: one is the number of all incoming links of the page, i.e., In-Links; the other is the PageRank value of the page. We compare the two Web graphs at week one and week six.
 relationship between the absolute increase of In-Links and the popularity of the first week. We sort the pages by their popularity and then divide them into ten groups of the same size. The horizontal axis represents the ten groups ordered by their popularity, with the right side corresponding to the most popular groups. The vertical axis represents the sum of absolute increase of In-Links in all pages in the group. The height of the bars represents the sum of absolute increase of all pages in the given group. For example, the height of the bar marked 80 repre-sents the sum of absolute increase of the pages ranking from 70% to 80%. We can notice from the figure that it is only the popular pages that become more popu-lar over time. In Fig 16 we show more details of the top 10% group. We further divide the top group into 5 subgroups and plot their popularity increase. We can see that the most popular pages obtain more new incoming links than others. relationship between the absolute increase of PageRank and the popularity in Fig 17. From the figure, we can see that the pages in the 70%-100% group increase their popularity, while the pages in the 20%-50% group actually decrease their popularity. The detailed view for the top 20% group is shown in Fig 18. in [6] also appears in China Web. In this paper, we have thoroughly studied the China Web both on its static and dynamic characteristics. The result shows that the China Web graph have many differences from global Web graph from the structure to the evolution of the Web. Additionally, we also analyze the nature of China site graph. As a future work, we plan to study the random model of China Web graph and to understand how the Web is created by the editors.
