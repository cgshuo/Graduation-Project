 Wikipedia has become an extremely po pular website, with over 284 language versions in 2012. Nevertheless, information of many articles is lacking because users can create and edit the informatio n freely. Furthermore, Wikipedia has different levels of value of its information depending on the language version of the site because different users create and edit articles of the respective lan-guage versions. We specifically examine the multilinguality of Wikipedia and propose a method that complements information of articles that lacks infor-mation based on comparing different language articles that have the similar contents[3].

In our proposed method, a user first browses an article in Wikipedia of the user X  X  language. Then the system extracts complementary information from user-specified articles that have been composed in other languages. As described in our research, we designate the lacking information as  X  X omplementary infor-mation X , an article that a user is browsing and which lacks information as a  X  X rowsing article X , its Wikipedia as a  X  X rowsing Wikipedia X , and its language as a  X  X rowsing language X . We also designate a different language article as a  X  X omparison article X , its Wikipedia as a  X  X omparison Wikipedia X , and its lan-guage as a  X  X omparison language X .

When we compare a browsing article wit h a comparison article, the infor-mation granularity is shown to differ. The browsing article is only one page, but the comparison article might have multiple pages because these articles are written by intercultural authors. Our p roposed method has been used to extract lacking information from all content in target articles in comparison Wikipedia. However, much un-complementary information is unrelated to a user X  X  browsing article in the results.

In this paper, we propose improvement of the method, which is to extract complementary information from different language articles in Wikipedia. The improvement points are the following.  X  Classifying complemen tary target articles.  X  Improving the comparison area based on a classified complementary target.  X  Experimenting to ascertain the use fulness of our proposed method. The process used for our proposed system is (1)A user who browses the Wikipedia article clicks the complement button on the web page, and inputs the compari-son language. (2)The system extracts comparison articles from the comparison Wikipedia using a link graph of Wikipedia. (3)It classifies the comparison articles and extracts a comparison area from each comparison article. (4)It compares the browsing article with the comparison articles extracted in step (3), and extracts complementary information. (5)It browses the browsing article and the comple-ment information.

In our prototype system, we use the English version of Wikipedia as the browsing Wikipedia, and the Japanese version of Wikipedia as the compari-son Wikipedia. Nevertheless, our system is language-independent. When we use other versions of Wikipedia, we can develop a version for any language. In ad-dition, our target users are people who browse Wikipedia articles. Our proposed approach uses link structure analysis techniques. Many studies use the Wikipedia link structure. Milne,[4] and Strub et al.[7] extract measures of semantic relatedness of terms using the Wikipedia link structure. Some studies have been conducted to examine complementary information. Ching et al. [1] propose a framework to assist Wikipedia editors to enrich Wikipedia articles. They extract complementary information by comparing mul-tilingual Wikipedia. However, they are not interested in differences of informa-tion granularity between the languages. In contrast, we consider the coverage of comparison articles and create a Wikipedia article to extract complementary information from comparison articles. Eklou et al.[2] proposed a method of in-formation complementation of Wikipedia by the web. They extract complemen-tary information from web pages using LDA. Their goal is similar to ours, but the target complement information is different. Ma et al.[6] proposed integrat-ing cross-media news contents such as TV programs and Web pages to provide users with complementary information. They extrac t complementary informa-tion from web pages using their proposed t opic structure. Th eir research issue, which is complement information, is similar to our issue. However, the target of the content is different. 3.1 Extraction of Comparison Articles from Comparison Wikipedia We extract comparison articles based on the Wikipedia link graph and our pro-posed relevance degree.
 Link Structure Analysis We create a link graph for a comparison Wikipedia based on the user X  X  browsing title. First, the system extracts an article having the same title as the user X  X  input from the comparison Wikipedia. We designate the article as  X  X he basic article X . We regard the basic article as the root node of the link graph. Next, we regard the interactive linked articles which are the subjects of link-out and link-in connections with the basic article as important and relevant articles to the basic article. The system extracts all interactive linked articles from the comparison Wikipedia. It includes the ar ticles as nodes and thereby creates the link graph.
 Calculating Relevance Degree The article of an interactive link does not always have a high relation to a basic node. We calculate the relevance degree between a root node (basic article) and other nodes (interactive linked articles) in the link graph. An important anchor text appears many times in a basic article, and appears also in the summary area in Wikipedia. We use that structural fea ture and calculate the relevance degree between the root node and other node in the link graph as described below. 1. The system divides the basic article according to the section which is the 2. From the link graph, the system extracts a title from a interactive linked 3. The system counts the anchor text of the target title in the summary area 4. It also counts of the anchor text in each segment of the basic article. The 5. It calculates the relevance degree be tween each segment and the interactive The system calculates from 2. to 5. for all interactive linked articles in the link graph. When relevance degree R i is less than the threshold  X  value, we delete the article from the link graph. When the system extracts complementary in-formation from the comparison articles, nodes that consist of a root node and other nodes become comparison articles. 3.2 Comparison Area in Comparison Articles Then some comparison articles have info rmation that is unrelated to the title of browsing article. For example, we extract  X  X y Neighbor Totoro X , which is famous Japanese animated movie as a basic article, then we extract  X  X ayama Hill X  as a comparison article. (Sayama Hill is the setting of the movie. The hill actually exists in Japan.) However, the Sayama Hill article invariably mentions the geographic information and the animals that live on the hill. The information about My Neighbor Totoro is only a small amount of the information included in the Sayama Hill article. In this case, our past proposed method extracted infor-mation such the geographically information and the animals in Sayama Hill as complementary information for My Neighbor Totoro. However this information is not related to My Neighbor Totoro. I n this paper, we propose a new method that incorporates consideration of the comparison area of comparison articles. In our new method, we first cluster three k inds of articles. Next we extract com-parison areas from articles of each kind and extract complementary information from them. 3.2.1 Clustering of Articles We divide the comparison articles into three types.  X  Basic article  X  Inclusive relation article  X  Partial match article 3.2.2 Comparison Area We extract complementary information from the comparison area, which is based on articles of three types described above.
 Basic Article A comparison area of the basic article is all contents of a page (article) because a basic article has the same title as the browsing article. It is strongly related to the browsing article. (Fig. 1(a)).
 Inclusive Relation Article An inclusive relation article is a subset of a basic article. We regard a comparison area of the inclusive relation article as all contents of a article. That is, the comparison area is the same as its basic article. (Fig. 1(a)).
 Partial Match Article We specifically examine the position of the anchor text which links to the basic article, in a partial match article. We extract a comparison area as follows:  X  An anchor text in a title area of section or sub-section.  X  Anchor text only in the context area of a partial match article.
 3.3 Extracting Complementary Information from Comparison After the system extracts comparison arti cles, it calculates a nd extracts comple-mentary information by comparing the browsing article with each comparison article. Almost all Wikipedia articles are divisible into segments based on the table of contents, which means that the segments are divided semantically. When comparing the similarity of multilingual Wikipedia, we specifically examine the segments of the table of contents of Wikipedia specifically. Particularly, we com-pare each article based on each segment.
 1. We extract nouns from respective articles. 2. We translate comparison articles to browsing language using dictionaries. At 3. We extract complementary information from each type of comparison article. We assessed the availability of extracting complementary information based on comparing our proposed method which is a calculated comparison area with a baseline which is not a calculated comparison area. In both of our experiments, we set an appropriate weight  X  =3.0 and threshold  X  =0.2 of the relevance degree described in equation (1) in section 3, and threshold  X  =0.2 of cosine similar-ity in equation (2) in our earlier experiment[3]. Table 1 presents results of the experiment. The precision is 0 . 26 higher than the baseline, which means that our proposed method is useful for extracting complementary information. An example of a good result is the browsing article is written for the plot and cast of My Neighbor Totoro. One comparison article is written about Sayama Hill, the geographic information related to Sayama Hill differs, but it is unrelated to the movie. This time, in our proposed method, the information is not a com-parison area. We do not extract the information as complementary information. However, the exemplary bad results are those for Manzai, which is a type of Japanese comedy. We can not extract the information written about the associ-ation of Manzai, Roukyoku Manzai which is a kind of manzai, and so on because the anchor text in each case is in an itemization area. Our proposed method processes an itemization area is a segme nt. Few contents are included in seg-ments. Therefore, we can not extract suc hinformation.Thisisleftasaproblem for future study. As described in this paper, we proposed a method for extracting complementary information from Wikipedia by comparing multilingual Wikipedia. Specifically, we improve our proposed method to examine the comparison area based on a classified complementary ta rget. This paper presented three important technical points, (1)Classifying complementary ta rget articles, (2)Im proving the compar-ison area based on a classified complem entary target, and (3)Experiment to measure the usefulness of our new proposed method.

Future work is that we should consider word sense disambiguation, because many instances of word sense disambiguation exist, but we have ignored such cases in the analyses presented in this paper.
