 This paper explores users X  browsi ng intents to predict the category of a user X  X  next access during we b surfing, and applies the results to objectionable content filtering. A user X  X  ac cess trail represented as a sequence of URLs reveals the contextual information of web browsing behaviors. We extract behavioral features of each clicked URL, i.e. , hostname, bag-of-words, gTLD, IP, and port, to develop a linear chain CRF m odel for context-aware category prediction. Large-scale experiments show that our method achieves a promising accuracy of 0.9396 for objectionable access identification without requesting their corresponding page content. Error analysis indicates that our proposed model results in a low false positive rate of 0.0571. In r eal-life filtering simulations, our proposed model accomplishes m acro-averaging blocking rate 0.9271, while maintaining a favorably low macro-averaging over-blocking rate 0.0575 for collabor atively filtering objectionable content with time change on the dynamic web. H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Information filtering. Collaborative filtering; click-th rough mining; Internet censorship With the proliferation of the Internet, the Web has become the largest accessible repository of in formation. Users usually issue queries to search engines and click search results to meet their various information needs. Query log analysis has found that the top three categories in terms of popularity in information access are pornography, entertainment, and music [1]. Innocuous searchers, especially children w ithout adult supervision, however, expect not to have sexually exp licit content included in their search results. Google X  X  SafeSearch filter provides searchers with the ability to configure the browser settings to prevent objectionable content from appearing in search results. Nevertheless, objectionable co ntent usually slips through the cracks, so keeping the filters as up-to-date as possible is a challenging issue on the rapidly changing web. Objectionable web content, such as pornography, gambling, violence, and drugs, may tend to cause objection, disapproval, or protest during users X  web surfing. Traditionally, intelligent content analysis has regarded the objectionable content identification problem as categorization with statically crawled datasets. Neural networks have been employed to classify pornographic web pages [10]. URL-ba sed features were extracted for pornographic web page categorization [12]. An inverse chi-square based method has been applied to mine content features for generating pornographic blacklists [9]. The bag of visual words has been adopted for adult image classification and filtering [2]. Motion information was associated with image features in detecting pornographic video content [5]. WebGuard is a filtering engine that combines textual, structural, and visual content-based features for cyberporn filtering [4]. The strength of intelligent content analysis lies in its superior accuracy, but comparatively more training time and human intervention are needed for the claimed performance. Recently, behavioral mining approaches by query logs have been proposed to exploit users X  search behaviors for objectionable web content filtering. Collective intelligence embedded in query logs has been explored for cyberporn filtering in a search-intent-based method [7, 8]. Query-URL click pairs have also been exploited for clustering similar pornographi c images [11]. Finally, pornographic blacklists have been generated collaboratively via searches-and-clicks for blocki ng pornographic web pages [6]. Users X  browsing behaviors on the web result in users X  click-through trails, which are defined as access sequences during web surfing for reflecting users X  browsi ng intents. A user X  X  access is further represented as its corr esponding category. For example, the well-known Internet service www.facebook.com is rated in the category  X  X ocial Networking X . Th e category of the clicked URL www.ebay.com/fashion is  X  X uction X  . A user X  X  click-through trail represented as a sequence of cate gories denotes an access context of a specific user. Take the following scenario as an example. Assume Michael inputs the re quested URL www.google.com to a browser directly for navigating to the specific web site. He issues the query  X  X ajor League Baseball X  and clicks the search result mlb.mlb.com/index.jsp. After br owsing the player information web pages inside the MLB website, e.g. , mlb.mlb.com/mlb/ players/?tcid=nav_mlb_player s and mlb.mlb.com/mlb/ transactions/?tcid=mm_mlb_player s, he decides to buy some products related to his favorit e players at Yahoo! Shopping, shopping.yahoo.com. In this ac cess context, the category sequence is  X  X earch Engines, X   X  X ports, X   X  X ports, X   X  X ports, X  and  X  X hopping X . In our study, we attempt to explore users X  browsing behaviors embedded in the click-through data to determine the category of a user X  X  next acce ss without analyzing web page content. The problem statement in this study is formulated as follows. Let u u 2 ... u ( n -1) u n be a user X  X  access sequence during web surfing, main research question is how to quickly determine the category of the  X  X nknown X  click-through at the user X  X  access time to keep up with the rapidly changing web. That is, given the context u u 2 ... u (n-1) , we focus on exploiting collective intelligence through a database with milli ons of categorized URLs for efficiently filtering disallowed users X  accesses. Clicked URLs, especially those pointing to ne wborn pages, are rated in the  X  X nknown X  category if they are not categorized in the database at the access time. In the backend, this proprietary engine adopts a batch strategy to analyze the corresponding content signatures for classifying these  X  X nknown X  URLs into pre-defined categories. After manually checking the candidate categories proposed by the content-based solution, these newly categorized URLs are used to expand the original databa se via scheduled updates. User click-through trails were divided into two distinct data sets shown as follows. (1) Training set: All of the trails in the training set are composed of definite categories. That is, all of the clicked URLs in the trails are rated into one of 83 definite categories. A total of 1,302,290 trails from December 1 st -15 th were selected for training, which consist of 42,73 9,198 users X  accesses during web surfing. (2) Test set: Each trail in the test set is denoted as a  X  X nknown X  category c i (1  X  i  X  n ) at the rating time t i , but becomes a definite category after manually checking at some later time t j ( t &lt; t j ). We use the rating category at time t j as the ground truth for performance evaluation. In total, 24,140 trails from December 16 th -31 th were selected, which c ontain 53,011 unknown accesses that are considered as test instances. In the first set of experiments, we considered the objectionable categories as positive targets. If the predicted result belonged to  X  X lcohol/Tobacco, X   X  X llegal Affairs, X   X  X rugs, X   X  X ambling, X   X  X arijuana, X   X  X ornography, X   X  X iolence/Racism, X  and  X  X bjectionable X . The following two approaches ba sed on click-through data were compared to demonstrate their performance. (1) Multi-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM): this model is a context-less method, which only focuses on the proposed features extracted from the target URLs themselves. (2) Behavioral CRF: this model is the proposed approach for context-aware category detection. concerned. We also measure th e performance when different numbers of previous access contex ts are involved. This number is denoted as K and is set from 1 to 5 in the experiments. Table 1 shows the experimental results. The performance difference between the two models was statistically significant ( p &lt;0.01), no matter which metric was adopted. The Behavioral CRF models performed better than the Multi-Class SVM model based on all the evaluation metrics, no matter how many previous accesses were considered. This reveals that the contextual information plays an important role for category prediction of users X  next accesses without the help of page content. In addition, the results imply that longer contex t may lead to better category prediction. Longer context can be explored if more computational resources are allowed. The Behavioral CRF model (K=5), which achieved a promising recall of 0. 9260, relatively high precision of 0.7981, and F1 score of 0.8573, performed the best for identifying objectionable content of a user X  X  ne xt access. This confirms that exploiting only collective intelligence embedded in users X  browsing behaviors without requesti ng the page content is feasible for objectionable access identification. Table 2 shows the confusion matrix of using the proposed Behavioral CRF model (K=5) for objectionable content objectionable web pages than the original TMUFE solution on the average. This reveals that our Behavioral CRF model is cost-effective for blocking those un known objectionabl e accesses at users X  access time. In addition, our approach achieved a favorably low macro-averaging over-blocking rate 0.0575 (SD=0.0156) with the passage of time, which reflecting that our approach is a reliable solution by exploring users X  browsing behaviors only for real-time filtering. Different from the related studies that only focus on the major domain  X  X ornography X  for objectionable content filtering, we tackle more objectionable domains, such as  X  X ambling, X   X  X rugs, X  and  X  X eapons, X  to prot ect children from inappropriate content during web surfing. Our work is much closer to real-world situations for naturally revealing the diversified characteristic of the Internet. It is difficult to know the actua l category distribution of users X  accesses on the dynamic web. Objectionable web content changes rapidly, in particular, due to th e adversarial characteristic of avoiding being filtered. Our click-through data, containing a huge number of worldwide users X  re al access sequences during web surfing, can approximately reflect the dynamic web. Objectionable content can exist in different languages. Traditional content-based solutions suffer from the multilingual issue. Multilingual lexicons in various objectionable domains have to be created and introduced to deal w ith this problem. Coverage of multilingual lexicons and disambiguation of term usages in the web page content become a new problem. Our users X  intent based browsing behavior analysis gets rid of the multilingual limitations, so it is more suitable fo r heterogeneous content. Intelligent content analysis is ofte n utilized in offline processing to semi-automatically cate gorize large volumes of unknown URLs. In contrast, our proposed model is a lightweight process that only explores collective intelligence embedded in browsing behaviors for collaboratively filte ring objectionable materials in online processing. In practice, our cost-effective approach is complementary to the existing content-based analysis for blocking objectionable web content as quickly as possible during children X  X  web surfing. This paper proposes the browsing behaviors based models for collaboratively objectionable content filtering. The major contribution of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of predicting categories for filter ing objectionable content without the need to crawl the page content for machine learning. More user-behavior-based discriminative features will be investigated in the future to further improve real-time filtering performance for keeping with the changing variability of objectionable web sites.
