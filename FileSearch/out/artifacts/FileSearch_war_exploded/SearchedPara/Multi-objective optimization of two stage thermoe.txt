 1. Introduction
The application of thermoelectric coolers (TECs) has grown appreciably because of the need for a steady, low-temperature, environment friendly operating environment for various applica-tions such as aerospace, military, medicine, biology and other electronic devices. However, the cooling capacity and coefficient of performance (COP) of TECs are low compared with traditional devices like vapor compression system, vapor absorption system, etc. Therefore, performance improvement of the TECs is an important issue in their applications ( Cheng and Lin, 2005 ; Pan et al., 2007 ).

With the help of one stage TEC, maximum 70 K temperature difference is produced when its hot end is maintained at room temperature. So, when a large temperature difference is required, two stage TECs should be employed ( Rowe, 1996 ). Usually two-stage TECs are commercially arranged in cascade; the cold stage is attached to the heat source and the hot stage pumps total heat to the environment. Moreover the two stage TECs are arranged in two different design configurations as shown in Fig. 1 . In such two stage TECs, the determination of the number of thermoelectric (TE) modules in hot stage and cold stage as well as the supply current to the hot stage and the cold stage are important for improving the COP and cooling capacity of TECs. Moreover, the consideration of temperature dependent material properties and existence of thermal and electric contact resistance between the contact surfaces of TECs make the determination of these para-meters complex ( Xuan et al., 2002a ; Cheng and Shih, 2006 ).
Traditional methods of optimization do not fare well over a broad spectrum of problem domains as they tend to obtain a local optimal solution. Considering the drawbacks of traditional opti-mization techniques, attempts can be made to optimize the TECs problem using nature inspired optimization algorithms like genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), arti-ficial bee colony (ABC), harmony search (HS), etc. Among all, most commonly used evolutionary optimization technique is the genetic algorithm. However, the effective working of GA requires determination of optimum controlling parameters such as cross-over rate and mutation rate. Similarly, PSO requires determina-tion of inertia weight, social and cognitive parameters. ABC requires determination of employed bees, onlooker bees, scout bees and limit. HS requires harmony memory consideration rate, pitch adjusting rate, and number of improvisations. In above mentioned algorithms, a change in the controlling parameters changes the effectiveness of the algorithm.

Recently, Rao et al. (2011) proposed a teaching X  X earning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm based on the natural phenomenon of teaching and learning. TLBO is an algorithm-specific para-meter-less algorithm. The implementation of TLBO does not require the determination of any controlling parameters which makes the algorithm robust and powerful. In this work, some modifications to the standard TLBO algorithm are introduced and the performance of the modified TLBO algorithm is investigated for multi-objective optimization of a two stage TEC.

Several other researchers ( Lai et al., 2004 ; Chen two stage TECs for optimization of COP or for optimum allocation of TE module.

So far, only GA is used for the optimization of TECs. Moreover, only single objective optimization of TECs was carried out by previous researchers. Considering this fact, the main objectives of this work are: (i) multi-objective optimization of the influential parameters of a two stage TEC using the basic TLBO and modified
TLBO algorithms and (ii) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified TLBO algorithm for multi-objective optimization of the
TEC. So far, TLBO algorithm has not been tried or experimented for the multi-objective optimization of TECs. In this paper, ability of the algorithm is demonstrated using an example. The optimi-zation results obtained by using TLBO and the modified TLBO algorithms are compared with those obtained by using GA for the same example considered by previous researchers.
 3. Teaching X  X earning-based optimization (TLBO)
TLBO is a teaching X  X earning process inspired algorithm pro-posed recently by Rao et al. (2011) based on the effect of influence of a teacher on the output of learners in a class. The algorithm mimics the teaching X  X earning ability of teacher and learners in a class room. Teacher and learners are the two vital components of the algorithm. In this optimization algorithm, a group of learners is considered as population and different design variables are considered as different subjects offered to the learners and the tion problem. In the entire population, the best solution is considered as the teacher. The working of TLBO is divided into two parts,  X  X eacher phase X  and  X  X earner phase X . Working of both the phases is explained below. 3.1. Teacher phase
It is the first part of the algorithm where learners learn through the teacher. During this phase a teacher tries to increase the mean result of the class room from any value M 1 to his or her move the mean of the class room M 1 to any other value M 2 is better than M 1 depending on his or her capability. Consider M be the mean and T i be the teacher at any iteration i . Now T to improve existing mean M j towards him or her so the new mean will be designated as M new and the difference between the existing mean and new mean is given by Difference_Mean i  X  r i  X  M new T F M j  X  X  1  X  where T F is the teaching factor which decides the value of mean to be changed, and r i is the random number in the range [0, 1]. Value randomly with equal probability as T  X  round  X  1  X  rand  X  0 , 1  X f 2 1 g X  2  X 
Based on this Difference_Mean, the existing solution is updated according to the following expression: X 3.2. Learner phase
It is the second part of the algorithm where learners increase their knowledge by interaction among themselves. A learner interacts randomly with other learners for enhancing his or her knowledge. A learner learns new things if the other learner has more knowledge than him or her. Mathematically the learning phenomenon of this phase is expressed below.

At any iteration i , considering two different learners X where i a j X X
Accept X new if it gives better function value. 4. Modified TLBO algorithm
In the basic TLBO algorithm, result of the learners is improved either by a single teacher or by interacting with other learners. considered in the basic TLBO algorithm. Moreover, the teaching extreme circumstances where learner learns either everything or nothing from the teacher. In this system, teacher has to give more effort to improve the result of learners. During the course of optimization, this situation results in slower convergence rate of optimization problem. So considering this fact, to speed up the search process and to improve the convergence rate, some mod-ifications have been introduced in the basic TLBO algorithm. 4.1. Number of teachers
One of the modifications in the TLBO algorithm is introducing more than one teacher for learners. In the basic version of TLBO there is only one teacher who teaches the learners and tries to class contains more number of below-average students, then the teacher has to put more effort to improve their results and even with this effort there might not be any apparent improvement in the results. In the optimization algorithm this fact results in more number of function evaluations to reach at the optimum solution and yields poor convergence rate. In order to overcome this issue, the basic TLBO algorithm is modified by introducing more than one and individual teacher is assigned to individual group of learners. group and if the level (i.e. results) of the group reaches up to the teacher. Thus the learners learn as per their ability from different teachers instead from one teacher which increases the possibility of improvement in the results of learners. During the course of optimization this situation incr eases the exploration and exploita-tion capacity of the algorithm. Mathematically, this modification is explained in the implementation steps of the algorithm. 4.2. Adaptive teaching factor Another modification is rela ted to the teaching factor ( T basic TLBO algorithm. Teaching factor decides the value of mean objective function during the optim ization). In the basic TLBO, the nothing from the teacher or learn all the things from the teacher respectively. Thus during the cou rse of optimization the objective learning phenomenon the learners may learn in any proportion from end state for learners but varies in-between also. Considering this algorithm. In the optimization algorithm the lower value of T the fine search in small steps but causes slow convergence. A larger value of T F speeds up the search but it reduces the exploration capability. The modified teaching factor is defined as T  X 
M _new D , i D  X  1 , 2 , ... , D n i  X  1 , 2 , ... N G  X  6  X  where, D n is the number of design variables and NG is the number of varies automatically during the search. Automatic tuning of T improves the performance of the algorithm. 4.3. Self-motivated learning
In the basic TLBO algorithm, the results of the students are improved either by learning from the teacher or by interacting with the other students. However, it is also possible that students are self-motivated and improve their knowledge by self-learning.
Thus the self-learning aspect to improvise the knowledge is considered in the modified TLBO algorithm which again increases the exploration and exploitation capacity of the basic TLBO algorithm. Mathematical formulation of this modification is given in the implementation steps of the algorithm.
 summarized below
Step 8 : for each group, update the learners X  knowledge with the help of teacher X  X  knowledge according to
Step 9 : for each group, update the learners X  knowledge by utilizing the knowledge of some other learner of the same group as per Eqs. (4) and (5).

Step 10 : learners of each group tries to improvise their knowl-edge by self-learning according to Step 11 : combine all the groups.

Step 12 : repeat the procedure from step 3 to 11 till the termination criterion is met.

This algorithm has been applied for the multi-objective optimiza-tion of a two stage TEC. The next section describes the thermal modeling of two stage TECs. 5. Thermal modeling of two stage TECs
Based on the work of Cheng and Shih (2006) , thermal model of the two stage TECs is formulated as described below.

The cascade two stage TECs are stacked one on the top of the other (as shown in Fig. 1 ). Here in this arrangement the top stage is the cold stage and the bottom stage is the hot stage. In Fig. 1 ,

As the material properties are considered to be dependent on the average temperature of the cold side and hot side of each stage, their values are calculated by the following correlation ( Cheng and Shih, 2006 ): i , p  X  a i , n  X  X  22 , 224  X  9300 : 6 T i , ave 0 : 9905 T k i , p  X  k i , n  X  X  62 , 605 277 : 7 T i , ave  X  0 : 4131 T
The total thermal resistance (RS t ) existing between the inter-face of the TECs is given by RS where, RS sprd and RS cont are the spreading resistance and contact resistance between the interface of the two TECs respectively.
Based on the work of Lee et al. (1995) and Cheng and Shih (2006) , the spreading resistances between the interface of the two TECs are calculated from the following equation: RS hot stage. The detailed explanation related to the equilibrium calculated by the following equation: where, factor 2 a represents the linear relationship between the cross-sectional area of the substrate and the TE modules ( Cheng and Shih, 2006 ).

The next section describes the objective function formulation based on this thermal model of two stage TECs. 6. Multi-objective optimization and formulation of objective functions
Multi-objective optimization has been defined as finding a vector of decision variables while optimizing (i.e. minimizing or maximizing) several objectives simultaneously, with a given set of constraints. In the present work, two such objectives namely maximizing the cooling capacity and maximizing the COP of the two stage TECs are considered simultaneously for multi-objective optimization.

The first objective is to maximize the cooling capacity of a two stage TEC as given by Eq. (29)
Z  X  Maximize Q c , c  X  X  X  , X  X  X  x 1 , x 2 , ... x D n , x i  X  1 , 2 , ... D n  X  29  X 
Subject to the set of constraints ( m ) g  X  X  X  r 0 , j  X  1 , 2 ... m  X  30  X  The second objective is to maximize the COP of a two stage TEC as given by Eq. (31)
Z  X  MaximizeCOP  X  Y  X  , Y  X  X  y 1 , y 2 , ... y D n , y i , min i  X  1 , 2 , ... D n  X  31  X 
Subject to a set of constraints ( m ) g  X  Y  X  r 0 , j  X  1 , 2 ... m  X  32  X 
The above mentioned single objective functions are put together for multi-objective optimization. The normalized multi-objective function ( Z ) is formulated considering different weight factors to both the objectives and is given by the following equation: Maximize Z  X  w 1  X  Z 1 = Z 1 , max  X  X  X  1 w 1  X  X  Z 2 = Z 2 , max where, w 1 is weight factor for the first objective function. Z and Z 2, max are the maximum values of the objective functions Z and Z 2 respectively when these objectives are considered inde-pendently. The last two terms in Eq. (33) takes into account the constraints violation. R 1 is the penalty parameter having a large value (1000 in the present work). The value of weight factor w can be decided by the designer and it is between 0 and 1. Any value of w 1 between 0 and 1 gives the relative importance to the individual objective function and the algorithm finds the design variables as per this relative importance. Based on the obtained design variables, Z 1 and Z 2 are obtained which represent one value of w 1 a set of optimum solutions, called Pareto solutions is obtained, each of which is a trade-off between the considered objective functions. In the present work we considered the value of w 1 from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.05.
 ness of the modified TLBO algorithm for the optimization of two stage TECs. 7. Application example of two stage TEC by analyzing an example of two stage TECs which was earlier analyzed by Cheng and Shih (2006) using GA. A Two stage TEC used to produce temperature of 210 K at the cold stage when its hot stage is maintained at a temperature of 300 K is needed to be optimized for maximum cooling capacity and maximum COP. The total number of TE modules of the two stages is 50 and the ratio of cross sectional area to the length of TE modules is 0.0018 m.
Thermal resistance is present at the interface of TEC. Alumina having thermal conductivity 30 W/m K is acting as a substrate to take into account the spreading resistance. The thickness of the substrate is 1 mm. To take into account the contact resistance between the two stages, the joint resistance is varied between 0.02 to 2 cm 2 K/W. The property values of TE material are considered to be temperature dependent. Moreover, the two stage TECs, electrically separated and electrically connected in series as shown in Fig. 1 are considered for the optimization. and upper limits of the design variables are considered in the present work of TECs optimization 4 r I h r 11  X  34  X  4 r I c r 11  X  35  X  2 r r r 7 : 33  X  36  X  are performed with different population sizes and number of of 15 with number of generations 30 is set for both the algorithms. With this strategy one hundred independent runs of the algorithms are performed for each objective function and average results of one hundred independent runs is reported in the present work. 7.1. Single objective consideration
To understand the working of modified TLBO algorithm, step-wise procedure for the implementation of modified TLBO algo-rithm for one generation is given in the appendix . For demonstra-tion of the procedure, maximization of cooling capacity of electrically separated TEC is considered as an objective function.
Table 1 shows the optimized parameters of the considered example obtained by using the TLBO and the modified TLBO approach for maximum cooling capacity as well as maximum COP when the considered two stage TEC is electrically separated and its comparison with the optimized parameters obtained by Cheng and Shih (2006) using the GA approach. When the joint resistance is 0.02 cm 2 K/W, present approach using the TLBO and the modified TLBO results in such combination of input current and
TE module which increases the cooling capacity by 3.84% as compared to the GA approach suggested by Cheng and Shih (2006) . Also as the joint resistance increases from 0.02 to 0.2 and then 2 cm 2 K/W, the increment in cooling capacity is 5.32% and 7.18% respectively as compared to the GA approach.
Similarly, for the maximum COP consideration, the present approaches yields 1.1%, 4.29% and 7.21% higher COP as compared to the GA approach when the joint resistance is 0.02, 0.2 and 2cm 2 K/W respectively.

Table 2 shows the comparison of the optimized parameters for a two stage TEC electrically connected in series. In this case also, the increment in cooling capacity is corresponding to 2.45%, 8.1% and 7.2% when the joint resistance is 0.02, 0.2 and 2 cm 2 respectively as compared to the GA approach considered by
Cheng and Shih (2006) . Similarly, for the maximum COP con-sideration the present approaches result in 0.5%, 7.5% and 5.41% higher COP as compared to the GA approach when the joint resistance is 0.02, 0.2 and 2 cm 2 K/W respectively. Moreover, in order to identify the effectiveness of the presented algorithm, Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithms are also applied to the considered problem and comparative results are shown in Tables 1 and 2 for TEC electrically separated as well as connected in series respectively. Figs. 2 and 3 show the convergence of the TLBO, modified TLBO, ABC and PSO algorithms for single objective optimization when the considered TEC is electrically separated and electrically in series respectively. For the fair comparison among all the algorithms, PSO and ABC are also applied with the population size of 15 and number algorithm performs better in terms of convergence. 7.2. Multi-objective consideration
The results of single objective optimization for maximum cooling capacity and maximum COP reveal that higher cooling capacity accompanies the lower COP and vice versa which reflects the necessity of multi-objective optimization for two stage TECs.
Eq. (33) represents the normalized objective function for multi-objective optimization. Fig. 4 shows the Pareto optimal curve obtained by using the modified TLBO algorithm for multi-objec-tive optimization when the considered two stage TECs are values of joint resistance the maximum cooling capacity observed at design point E where the COP is minimum. On the other hand, the maximum COP occurs at design point A where the cooling capacity has minimum value. Specifications of five sample design points A X  X  in Pareto optimal fronts for different values of joint and Table 3 that by properly modulating the input current of hot stage and cold stage as well as TE module of each stage, the cooling capacity and COP of the two stage TEC increases with the increase in joint resistance.
 the modified TLBO algorithm for the two stage TECs electrically connected in series. Looking at the Pareto front obtained for different values of joint resistance it is found that the maximum cooling capacity exists at design point E where the COP is lowest.
On the other hand, the maximum COP occurs at design point A where the cooling capacity has minimum value. Table 4 shows the specifications of sample design points A X  X  in Pareto optimal fronts for different values of the joint resistance.

The effect of number of teachers on the fitness value and convergence rate of the multi-objective function is shown gra-phically in Figs. 6 and 7 when the TEC is electrically separated as well as in series respectively. Design point D of the Pareto optimal curves is considered for demonstrating the effect of teachers. It is observed from Figs. 6 and 7 that as the number of teachers increases, the algorithm performs better in terms of the conver-gence rate. However, after sufficient number of teachers, any increment in the number of teachers does not improve the performance of the algorithm.

In order to identify the effect of input current and TE modules of each stage on the cooling capacity and COP, design point D of the Pareto optimal curves is considered. Fig. 8 shows the effect of I the cooling capacity and COP when the considered two stage TEC is increase in I h the cooling capacity and COP of TEC increases and reaches a maximum value. With further increase in I h , the cooling capacity and COP decrease. Also it is observed that as the joint resistance is increased from 0.02 to 2 cm 2 K/W, the value of I which the cooling capacity and COP become maximum is reduced. and COP increases with the increase in joint resistance.
Fig. 9 shows the effect of I c on the cooling capacity and COP when the considered two stage TEC is electrically separated. It is observed from Figs. 9 and 10 that when joint resistance is 0.02 cm 2 K/W the sensitivity of I c for cooling capacity and COP is more comparable to I h . But as the joint resistance is increased the sensitivity of I h is increased while sensitivity of I
Fig. 10 shows the effect of ratio of TE modules between the hot stage and the cold stage ( r ) when the considered two stage TEC is resistance increases from 0.2 to 2 cm2 K/W the optimum value of r at which cooling capacity and COP become maximum is reduced. This behavior reflects that the more number of TE modules is required for cold stage as the joint resistance is increased. The effect of I h , I c and r on the cooling capacity and
COP of the electrically series connected TEC is also very similar to the electrically separated TEC.

To evaluate the performance of modified TLBO algorithm, Sign and Wilcoxon statistical tests are applied to the considered algorithms. The details of these tests are available in the work of Derrac et al. (2011) . Multi-objective function of electrically 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9 are considered for both the tests. All the algorithms are run 50 times with population size of 15 and number of generations of 30.

In the ranking, R  X  indicates the sum of ranks for the problem in which the first algorithm outperformed the second and R indicates the sum of ranks for the opposite. After obtaining R  X  and R  X  , their associated p -values have been com-puted. A p -value provides information about whether a statistical result is: smaller the p -value, greater the difference between the considered algorithms. Table 5(b) summarizes the results of Wilcoxon X  X  test. It is observed from the results that the modified

In the present work, basic TLBO algorithm is modified by introducing the concept of number of teachers, adaptive teaching factor and self-motivated learning. The presented modifications speed up the convergence rate of the basic TLBO algorithm. The modified TLBO algorithm is applied successfully to the multi-objective optimization of a two stage TEC considering two conflicting objectives: cooling capacity and COP. Two different configurations of TECs, electrically separated and electrically connected in series are investigated for the optimization. More-over, the contact and spreading resistance of TEC are also considered. The ability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by using an example and the performance of the modified TLBO algorithm is compared with the performance of basic TLBO and GA. Improvements in the results are observed using the basic TLBO and modified TLBO algorithms as compared to the GA approach showing the improvement potential of the proposed algorithm for such thermodynamic optimization. The proposed algorithm can be easily customized to suit the optimization of other types of thermal systems involving large number of vari-ables and objectives. These features boost up the applicability of the proposed algorithm for the thermal systems optimization. Appendix. implementation of modified TLBO for optimization

Stop if maximum generation number is achieved; otherwise repeat from step 3.

It is observed from the above results that the average ( f ( X ) and the best value of the objective function increase as algorithm proceeds from the teacher phase to learner phase and learner phase to self-motivated learning phase in the same generation. In the same way the objective function value is also increased with the number of generations.
