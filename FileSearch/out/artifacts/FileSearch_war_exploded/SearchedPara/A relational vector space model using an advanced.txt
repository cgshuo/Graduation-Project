The importance of an IO o in an image I has been defined as: is applied in order to align both lower and upper bounds ( Lee, 1997 ).
The criteria S , P , and H are modeled in the following way: face according to the following formula: where n o p is the number of pixels in o , n I p is the number of pixels in I , and log that is [0,1]. 2. The position criterion P is integrated into our model through a non-uniform probability density function: the image, (c) a conic distribution, and (d) a bell-shaped (Gaussian-like) distribution. o of the image according to this criterion. distribution of IOs in an image, in order to represent the  X  X  disorder  X  X  in the image: p  X  o ; I  X 2 X  1 n I apply a normalization factor.
