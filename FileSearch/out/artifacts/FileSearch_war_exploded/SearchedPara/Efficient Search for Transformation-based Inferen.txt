 In many NLP settings it is necessary to identify that a certain semantic inference relation holds be-tween two pieces of text. For example, in para-phrase recognition it is necessary to identify that the meanings of two text fragments are roughly equiva-lent. In passage retrieval for question answering, it is needed to detect text passages from which a sat-isfying answer can be inferred. A generic formula-tion for the inference relation between two texts is given by the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) paradigm (Dagan et al., 2005), which is adapted here for our investigation. In this setting, a system is given two text fragments, termed  X  X ext X  ( T ) and  X  X y-pothesis X  ( H ), and has to recognize whether the hy-pothesis is entailed by (inferred from) the text.
An appealing approach to such textual inferences is to explicitly transform T into H , using a sequence of transformations (Bar-Haim et al., 2007; Harmel-ing, 2009; Mehdad, 2009; Wang and Manning, 2010; Heilman and Smith, 2010; Stern and Dagan, 2011). Examples of such possible transformations are lexical substitutions (e.g.  X  X etter X   X   X  X essage X ) and predicate-template substitutions (e.g.  X  X  [verb-active] Y X   X   X  X  [verb-passive] by X X ), which are based on available knowledge resources. Another example is coreference substitutions, such as replac-ing  X  X e X  with  X  X he employee X  if a coreference re-solver has detected that these two expressions core-fer. Table 1 exemplifies this approach for a particu-lar T -H pair. The rationale behind this approach is that each transformation step should preserve infer-ence validity, such that each text generated along this process is indeed inferred from the preceding one.
An inherent aspect in transformation-based infer-ence is modeling the certainty that each inference step is valid. This is usually achieved by a cost-based or probabilistic model, which quantifies con-fidence in the validity of each individual transfor-mation and consequently of the complete chain of inference.

Given a set of possible transformations, there may be many transformation sequences that would trans-form T to H . This creates a very large search space, where systems have to find the  X  X est X  transformation sequence  X  the one of lowest cost, or of highest prob-ability. To the best of our knowledge, this search challenge has not been investigated yet in a substan-tial manner: each of the above-cited works described the search method they used, but none of them tried alternative methods while evaluating search perfor-mance. Furthermore, while experimenting with our own open-source inference system, B IU T EE 1 , we observed that search efficiency is a major issue, of-ten yielding practically unsatisfactory run-times.
This paper investigates the search problem in transformation-based textual inference, naturally falling within the framework of heuristic AI (Ar-tificial Intelligence) search. To facilitate such in-vestigation, we formulate a generic search scheme which incorporates many search variants as special cases and enable a meaningful comparison between the algorithms. Under this framework, we identify special characteristics of the textual inference search space, that lead to the development of two novel al-gorithmic components: a special lookahead method for node expansion, named local lookahead , and a gradient-based evaluation function. Together, they yield a new search algorithm, which achieved sub-stantially superior search performance in our evalu-ations.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of transformation-based inference systems, AI search algorithms, and search methods realized in prior in-ference systems. Section 3 formulates the generic search scheme that we have investigated, which cov-ers a broad range of known algorithms, and presents our own algorithmic contributions. These new algo-rithmic contributions were implemented in our sys-tem, B IU T EE . In Section 4 we evaluate them empir-ically, and show that they improve search efficiency as well as solution X  X  quality. Search performance is evaluated on two recent RTE benchmarks, in terms of runtime, ability to find lower-cost transformation chains and impact on overall inference. Applying sequences of transformations to recognize textual inference was suggested by several works. Such a sequence may be referred to as a proof , in the sense that it is used to  X  X rove X  the hypothesis from the text. Although various works along this line differ from each other in several respects, many of them share the common challenge of finding an optimal proof. The following paragraphs review the major research approaches in this direction. We fo-cus on methods that perform transformations over parse trees, and highlight the search challenge with which they are faced. 2.1 Transformation-based textual inference Several researchers suggested using various types of transformations in order to derive H from T . Some suggested a set of predefined transforma-tions, for example, insertion , deletion and substitu-tion of parse-tree nodes, by which any tree can be transformed to any other tree. These transforma-tions were used by the open-source system EDITS (Mehdad, 2009), and by (Wang and Manning, 2010). Since the above mentioned transformations are lim-ited in capturing certain interesting and prevalent semantic phenomena, an extended set of tree edit operations (e.g., relabel-edge, move-sibling, etc.) was proposed by Heilman and Smith (2010). Simi-larly, Harmeling (2009) suggested a heuristic set of 28 transformations, which include various types of node-substitutions as well as restructuring of the en-tire parse-tree.

In contrast to such predefined sets of transfor-mations, knowledge oriented approaches were sug-gested by Bar-Haim et al. (2007) and de Salvo Braz et al. (2005). Their transformations are defined by knowledge resources that contain a large amount of entailment rules , or rewrite rules , which are pairs of parse-tree fragments that entail one another. Typical examples for knowledge resources of such rules are DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001), and TEASE (Szpek-tor et al., 2004), as well as syntactic transforma-tions constructed manually. In addition, they used knowledge-based lexical substitutions.

However, when only knowledge-based transfor-mations are allowed, transforming the text into the hypothesis is impossible in many cases. This limi-tation is dealt by our open-source integrated frame-work, B IU T EE (Stern and Dagan, 2011), which incorporates knowledge-based transformations (en-tailment rules) with a set of predefined tree-edits. Motivated by the richer structure and search space provided by B IU T EE , we adopted it for our empiri-cal investigations.

The semantic validity of transformation-based in-ference is usually modeled by defining a cost or a probability estimation for each transformation. Costs may be defined manually (Kouylekov and Magnini, 2005), but are usually learned automati-cally (Harmeling, 2009; Mehdad, 2009; Wang and Manning, 2010; Heilman and Smith, 2010; Stern and Dagan, 2011). A global cost (or probability esti-mation) for a complete sequence of transformations is typically defined as the sum of the costs of the involved transformations.

Finding the lowest cost proof, as needed for de-termining inference validity, is the focus of our re-search. Textual inference systems limited to the standard tree-edit operations (insertion, deletion, substitution) can use an exact algorithm that finds the optimal solution in polynomial time under cer-tain constraints (Bille, 2005). Nevertheless, for the extended set of transformations it is unlikely that ef-ficient exact algorithms for finding lowest-cost se-quences are available (Heilman and Smith, 2010).
In this harder case, the problem can be viewed as an AI search problem. Each state in the search space is a parse-tree, where the initial state is the text parse-tree, the goal state is the hypothesis parse-tree, and we search for the shortest (in terms of costs) path of transformations from the initial state to the goal state. Next we briefly review major concepts from the field of AI search and summarize some rel-evant proposed solutions. 2.2 Search Algorithms Search algorithms find a path from an initial state to a goal state by expanding and generating states in a search space. The term generating a state refers to creating a data structure that represents it, while expanding a state means generating all its immedi-ate derivations. In our domain, each state is a parse tree, which is expanded by performing all applicable transformations.
 Best-first search is a common search framework. It maintains an open list (denoted hereafter as OPEN) containing all the generated states that have not been expanded yet. States in OPEN are prior-itized by an evaluation function , f ( s ) . A best-first search algorithm iteratively removes the best state (according to f ( s ) ) from OPEN, and inserts new states being generated by expanding this best state. The evaluation function is usually a linear combina-tion of the shortest path found from the start state to state s , denoted by g ( s ) , and a heuristic function, de-noted by h ( s ) , which estimates the cost of reaching a goal state from s .

Many search algorithms can be viewed as spe-cial cases or variations of best-first search. The well-known A* (Hart et al., 1968). algorithm is a best-first search that uses an evaluation function f ( s ) = g ( s ) + h ( s ) . Weighted A* (Pohl, 1970) uses an evaluation function f ( s ) = w  X  g ( s ) + h ( s ) , where w is a parameter, while pure heuristic search uses f ( s ) = h ( s ) . K -BFS (Felner et al., 2003) ex-pands k states in each iteration. Beam search (Furcy and Koenig, 2005; Zhou and Hansen, 2005) limits the number of states stored in OPEN, while Greedy search limits OPEN to contain only the single best state generated in the current iteration.

The search algorithm has crucial impact on the quality of proof found by a textual inference system, as well as on its efficiency. Next, we describe search strategies used in prior works for textual inference. 2.3 Search in prior inference models In spite of being a fundamental problem, prior so-lutions to the search challenge in textual inference were mostly ad-hoc. Furthermore, there was no in-vestigation of alternative search methods, and no evaluation of search efficiency and quality was re-ported. For example, in (Harmeling, 2009) the order by which the transformations are performed is pre-determined, and in addition many possible deriva-tions are discarded, to prevent exponential explo-sion. Handling the search problem in (Heilman and Smith, 2010) was by a variant of greedy search, driven by a similarity measure between the current parse-tree and the hypothesis, while ignoring the cost already paid. In addition, several constraints on the search space were implemented. In the earlier version of B IU T EE (Stern and Dagan, 2011) 2 , a ver-sion of beam search was incorporated, named here-after B IU T EE -orig. This algorithm uses the evalua-tion function f ( s ) = g ( s ) + w i  X  h ( s ) , where in each iteration ( i ) the value of w is increased, to ensure successful termination of the search. Nevertheless, its efficiency and quality were not investigated.
In this paper we consider several prominent search algorithms and evaluate their quality. The evaluation concentrates on two measures: the run-time required to find a proof, and proof quality (mea-sured by its cost). In addition to evaluating standard search algorithms we propose two novel compo-nents specifically designed for proof-based textual-inference and evaluate their contribution. In this section we formalize our search problem and specify a unifying search scheme by which we test several search algorithms in a systematic manner. Then we propose two novel algorithmic components specifically designed for our problem. We conclude by presenting our new search algorithm which com-bines these two ideas. 3.1 Inference and search space formalization Let t be a parse tree, and let o be a transforma-tion. Applying o on t , yielding t 0 , is denoted by t ` o t 0 . If the underlying meaning of t 0 can in-deed be inferred from the underlying meaning of t , then we refer to the application of o as valid . Let O = ( o 1 ,o 2 ,...o n ) be a sequence of transforma-tions, such that t 0 ` o 1 t 1 ` o 2 t 2 ... ` o n t n . We write t 0 ` O t n , and say that t n can be proven from t by applying the sequence O . The proof might be valid, if all the transformations involved are valid, or invalid otherwise.

An inference system specifies a cost , C ( o ) , for each transformation o . In most systems the costs are automatically learned. The interpretation of a high cost is that it is unlikely that applying o will be valid. The cost of a sequence O = ( o 1 ,o 2 ,...o n ) is defined as P n i =1 C ( o ) (or ,in some systems, Q i =1 C ( o ) ). Denoting by t T and t H the text parse tree and the hypothesis parse tree, a proof system has to find a sequence O with minimal cost such that t
T ` O t H . This forms a search problem of finding the lowest-cost proof among all possible proofs.
The search space is defined as follows. A state s is a parse-tree. The start state is t T and the goal state is t H . In some systems any state s in which t H is embedded is considered as goal as well.

Given a state s , let { o (1) ,o (2) ...o ( m ) } be m transformations that can be applied on it. Expand-ing s means generating m new states, s ( j ) , j = 1 ...m , such that s ` o ( j ) s ( j ) . The number m is called branching factor . Our empirical observations on B IU T EE showed that its branching factor ranges from 2-3 for some states to about 30 for other states. 3.2 Search Scheme Our empirical investigation compares a range prominent search algorithms, described in Section 2. To facilitate such investigation, we formulate them in the following unifying scheme (Algorithm 1). Algorithm 1 Unified Search Scheme
Initially, the open list, OPEN contains the initial state. Then, the best k expand states from OPEN are chosen, according to the evaluation function f ( s ) (line 3), and expanded using the expansion func-tion expand ( s ) . In classical search algorithms, expand ( s ) means generating a set of states by ap-plying all the possible state transition operators to s . Next, we remove from OPEN the states which were expanded, and add the newly generated states. Fi-nally, we keep in OPEN only the best k maintain states, according to the evaluation function f ( s ) (line 6). This process repeats until the goal state is found in BEST (line 7). Table 2 specifies how known search algorithms, described in Section 2, fit into the uni-fied search scheme.

Since runtime efficiency is crucial in our domain, we focused on improving one of the simple but fast algorithms, namely, greedy search. To improve the quality of the proof found by greedy search, we in-troduce new algorithmic components for the expan-sion and evaluation functions, as described in the next two subsections, while maintaining efficiency 3.3 Evaluation function In most domains, the heuristic function h ( s ) esti-mates the cost of the minimal-cost path from a cur-rent state, s , to a goal state. Having such a function, the value g ( s ) + h ( s ) estimates the expected total cost of a search path containing s . In our domain, it is yet unclear how to calculate such a heuristic func-tion. Given a state s , systems typically estimate the difference (the gap) between s and the hypothesis t
H (the goal state). In B IU T EE this is quantified by the number of parse-tree nodes and edges of t H that do not exist in s . However, this does not give an estimation for the expected cost of the path (the se-quence of transformations) from s to the goal state. This is because the number of nodes and edges that can be changed by a single transformation can vary from a single node to several nodes (e.g., by a lexi-cal syntactic entailment rule). Moreover, even if two transformations change the same number of nodes and edges, their costs might be significantly differ-ent. Consequently, the measurement of the cost ac-cumulated so far ( g ( s ) ) and the remaining gap to t H ( h ( s ) ) are unrelated. We note that a more sophisti-cated heuristic function was suggested by Heilman and Smith (2010), based on tree-kernels. Neverthe-less, this heuristic function, serving as h ( s ) , is still unrelated to the transformation costs ( g ( s ) ).
We therefore propose a novel gradient-style func-tion to overcome this difficulty. Our function is designed for a greedy search in which OPEN al-ways contains a single state, s . Let s j be a state generated from s , the cost of deriving s j from s is  X  g ( s j )  X  g ( s j )  X  g ( s ) . Similarly, the reduc-tion in the value of the heuristic function is de-fined  X  h ( s j )  X  h ( s )  X  h ( s j ) . Now, we define f  X  ( s j )  X  sures how costly it is to derive s j relative to the obtained decrease in the remaining gap to the goal state. For the edge case in which h ( s )  X  h ( s j )  X  0 , we define f  X  ( s j ) =  X  . Empirically, we show in our experiments that the function f  X  ( s ) performs better than the traditional functions f ( s ) = g ( s ) + h ( s ) and f w ( s ) = g ( s ) + w  X  h ( s ) in our domain. 3.4 Node expansion method When examining the proofs produced by the above mentioned algorithms, we observed that in many cases a human could construct proofs that exhibit some internal structure, but were not revealed by the algorithms. Observe, for example, the proof in Ta-ble 1. It can be seen that transformations 2,3 and 4 strongly depend on each other. Applying trans-formation 3 requires first applying transformation 2, and similarly 4 could not be applied unless 2 and 3 are first applied. Moreover, there is no gain in apply-ing transformations 2 and 3, unless transformation 4 is applied as well. On the other hand, transformation 1 does not depend on any other transformation. It may be performed at any point along the proof, and moreover, changing all other transformations would not affect it.

Carefully examining many examples, we general-ized this phenomenon as follows. Often, a sequence of transformations can be decomposed into a set of coherent subsequences of transformations, where in each subsequence the transformations strongly de-pend on each other, while different subsequences are independent. This phenomenon can be utilized in the following way: instead of searching for a com-plete sequence of transformations that transform t T into t H , we can iteratively search for independent co-herent subsequences of transformations, such that a combination of these subsequences will transform t
T into t H . This is somewhat similar to the tech-nique of applying macro operators, which is used in automated planning (Botea et al., 2005) and puzzle solving (Korf, 1985).

One technique for finding such subsequences is to perform, for each state being expanded, a brute-force depth-limited search, also known as looka-head (Russell and Norvig, 2010; Bulitko and Lus-trek, 2006; Korf, 1990; Stern et al., 2010). How-ever, performing such lookahead might be slow if the branching factor is large. Fortunately, in our domain, coherent subsequences have the following characteristic which can be leveraged: typically, a transformation depends on a previous one only if it is performed over some nodes which were af-fected by the previous transformation. Accordingly, our proposed algorithm searches for coherent subse-quences, in which each subsequent transformation must be applied to nodes that were affected by the previous transformation.

Formally, let o be a transformation that has been applied on a tree t , yielding t 0 .  X  affected ( o,t 0 ) denotes the subset of nodes in t 0 which were affected (modi-fied or created) by the application of o .

Next, for a transformation o , applied on a parse tree t , we define  X  required ( t,o ) as the subset of t  X  X  nodes required for applying o (i.e., in the absence of these nodes, o could not be applied).

Finally, let t be a parse-tree and  X  be a subset of its nodes. enabled ops( t, X  ) is a function that re-turns the set of the transformations that can be ap-plied on t , which require at least one of the nodes in  X  . Formally, enabled ops( t, X  )  X  { o  X  O :  X   X   X  required ( t,o ) 6 =  X  X  , where O is the set of trans-formations that can be applied on t . In our algo-rithm,  X  is the set of nodes that were affected by the preceding transformation of the constructed subse-quence.

The recursive procedure described in Algorithm 2 generates all coherent subsequences of lengths up to d . It should be initially invoked with t -the current state (parse tree) being expanded,  X  -the set of all its nodes, d -the maximal required length, and  X  as an empty initial sequence. We use O  X  o as concatenation of an operation o to a subsequence O .
 Algorithm 2 local-lookahead ( t ,  X  , d , O )
The loop in lines 5 -8 iterates over transforma-tions that can be applied on the input tree, t , requir-ing the same nodes that were affected by the pre-vious transformation of the subsequence being con-structed. Note that in the first call enabled ops( t, X  ) contain all operations that can be applied on t , with no restriction. Applying an operation o results in a new subsequence O  X  o . This subsequence will be part of the set of subsequences found by the proce-dure. In addition, it will be used in the next recur-sive call as the prefix of additional (longer) subse-quences. 3.5 Local-lookahead gradient search We are now ready to define our new algorithm L ( LLGS ) . In LLGS, like in greedy search, k maintain = k expand = 1 . expand ( s ) is defined to return all states generated by subsequences found by the local-lookahead procedure, while the evalua-tion function is defined as f = f  X  (see last row of Table 2). In this section we first evaluate the search perfor-mance in terms of efficiency (run time), the quality of the found proofs (as measured by proof cost), and overall inference performance achieved through var-ious search algorithms. Finally we analyze the con-tribution of our two novel components. 4.1 Evaluation settings We performed our experiments on the last two published RTE datasets: RTE-5 (2009) and RTE-6 (2010). The RTE-5 dataset is composed of a training and test corpora, each containing 600 text-hypothesis pairs, where in half of them the text en-tails the hypothesis and in the other half it does not. In RTE-6, each of the training and test cor-pora consists of 10 topics, where each topic con-tains 10 documents. Each corpus contains a set of hypotheses (211 in the training dataset, and 243 in the test dataset), along with a set of candidate en-tailing sentences for each hypothesis. The system has to find for each hypothesis which candidate sen-tences entail it. To improve speed and results, we used the filtering mechanism suggested by (Mirkin et al., 2009), which filters the candidate sentences by the Lucene IR engine 3 . Thus, only top 20 candi-dates per hypothesis were tested
Evaluation of each of the algorithms was performed by running B IU T EE while replacing B
IU T EE -orig with this algorithm. We employed a comprehensive set of knowledge resources (avail-able in B IU T EE  X  X  web site): WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), Directional similarity (Kotlerman et al., 2010), DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and generic syn-tactic rules. In addition, we used coreference substi-tutions, detected by ArkRef 4 .

We evaluated several known algorithms, de-scribed in Table 2 above, as well as B IU T EE -orig. The latter is a strong baseline, which outperforms known search algorithms in generating low cost proofs. We compared all the above mentioned al-gorithms to our novel one, LLGS.

We used the training dataset for parameter tun-ing, which controls the trade-off between speed and quality. For weighted A*, as well as for greedy search, we used w = 6 . 0 , since, for a few instances, lower values of w resulted in prohibitive runtime. For beam search we used k = 150 , since higher val-ues of k did not improve the proof cost on the train-ing dataset. The value of d in LLGS was set to 3 . d = 4 yielded the same proof costs, but was about 3 times slower.

Since lower values of w could be used by weighted A* for most instances, we also ran ex-periments where we varied the value of w accord-ing to the dovetailing method suggested in (Valen-zano et al., 2010) (denoted dovetailing WA* ) as fol-lows. When weighted A* has found a solution, we reran it with a new value of w , set to half of the previous value. The idea is to guide the search for lower cost solutions. This process was halted when the total number of states generated by all weighted A* instances exceeded a predefined constant (set to 10 , 000 ). 4.2 Search performance This experiment evaluates the search algorithms in both efficiency (run-time) and proof quality. Effi-ciency is measured by the average CPU (Intel Xeon 2.5 GHz) run-time (in seconds) for finding a com-plete proof for a text-hypothesis instance, and by the average number of generated states along the search. Proof quality is measured by its cost.

The comparison of costs requires that all experi-ments are performed on the same model which was learned during training. Thus, in the training phase we used the original search of B IU T EE , and then ran the test phase with each algorithm separately. The results, presented in Table 3, show that our novel algorithm, LLGS, outperforms all other algorithms in finding lower cost proofs. The second best is B
IU T EE -orig which is much slower by a factor of 3 (on RTE-5) to 8 (on RTE-6) 5 . While inherently fast algorithms, particularly greedy and pure heuris-tic, achieve faster running times, they achieve lower proof quality, as well as lower overall inference per-formance (see next subsection). 4.3 Overall inference performance In this experiment we test whether, and how much, finding better proofs, by a better search algorithm, improves overall success rate of the RTE system. Table 4 summarizes the results (accuracy in RTE-5 and F1 in RTE-6). We see that in RTE-5 LLGS out-performs all other algorithms, and B IU T EE -orig is the second best. This result is statistically significant with p &lt; 0 . 02 according to McNemar test. In RTE-6 we see that although LLGS tends to finds lower cost proofs, as shown in Table 3, B IU T EE obtains slightly lower results when utilizing this algorithm. 4.4 Component evaluation In this experiment we examine separately our two novel components. We examined f  X  by running LLGS with alternative evaluation functions. The re-sults, displayed in Table 5, show that using f  X  yields better proofs and also improves run time.
Our local-lookahead (Subsection 3.4) was exam-ined by running LLGS with alternative node expan-sion methods. One alternative to local-lookahead is standard expansion by generating all immediate derivations. Another alternative is to use the stan-dard lookahead, in which a brute-force depth-limited search is performed in each iteration, termed here  X  X xhaustive lookahead X . The results, presented in Table 6, show that by avoiding any type of looka-head one can achieve fast runtime, while compro-mising proof quality. On the other hand, both ex-haustive and local lookahead yield better proofs and accuracy, while local lookahead is more than 4 times faster than exhaustive lookahead. In this paper we investigated the efficiency and proof quality obtained by various search algorithms. Con-sequently, we observed special phenomena of the search space in textual inference and proposed two novel components yielding a new search algorithm, targeted for our domain. We have shown empirically that (1) this algorithm improves run time by factors of 3-8 relative to B IU T EE -orig, and by similar fac-tors relative to standard AI-search algorithms that achieve similar proof quality; and (2) outperforms all other algorithms in finding low cost proofs.
In future work we plan to investigate other search paradigms, e.g., Monte-Carlo style approaches (Kocsis and Szepesv  X  ari, 2006), which do not fall under the AI search scheme covered in this paper. In addition, while our novel components were moti-vated by the search space of textual inference, we foresee their potential utility in other application areas for search, such as automated planning and scheduling.
