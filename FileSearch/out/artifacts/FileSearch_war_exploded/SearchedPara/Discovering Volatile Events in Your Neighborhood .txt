 sonal computers, there has been growth in location-based services (LBSs) [16], such mendation. Such LBSs mainly deal with static POI (point of interest) data and usually do not pay attention to occasional or volatile events, such as performances of singers events, and even if one does, it could be after the event. 
The features of volatile events include the following: one or more words about an words correlate with a specific place name. For example:  X 
I enjoyed XX at the new YY restaurant near the ZZ station.  X  XX event at YY was very exciting! detects the increase in the number of documents following the occurrence of an event [7], is often applied to news documents or blog entries. However, the number of web-tion of topics. 
With regard to the second feature, one of the issues concerns determining the type of location name that would be useful. In urban areas in Japan, many places are near few specific locations, can be used as well as the topicality of each event. using a query including station names. 
Although there have been studies on clustering and topic detection for webpages or plied to Japanese EPG (electronic program guide) data in the previous report, is used. introduced in this paper. ing our local-area topic extraction meth od. Section 4 shows related works. We define the problem of local event detection as a variation of the hot topic extrac-tion task. In this section, the extraction method is introduced. 2.1 Overview Figure 1 shows the process flow of the proposed topic extraction method. 
First, blog entries are collected in advan ce. Entries are collected hourly in the RSS module removes entries including NG terms usually used for advertising or offensive to public order and morals. 
Second, document vectors are generated from the collected entries using morpho-technique [6]. detecting events within the same period. The subtopic words for each subtopic cluster formed to remove entries irrelevant to th e topic, which are sometimes extracted when the topic word used is too general. 
Finally, the topicality score is calculated for each topic. The topicality score is de-to the long-term (3 days in this paper) average frequency of the same topic. If the Z this process. 
Using the above method, the hot topics for each area are extracted. Figure 2 shows examples of extracted topics. This style is compact and applicable for a small display on a mobile terminal. 2.2 Topic Extraction tween two documents  X  and  X  as follows: follows: expressions of time, quantities, monetary values, and percentages. NER systems have been created that use linguistic grammar-based techniques as well as statistical mod-neric named entity classes covering person names, place names, organization names, numbers, and so on, originally developed for a question answering system [14]. 
Topics are extracted with the agglomerativ e clustering process by folding two clus-clusters are added as follows: 2.3 Topic Word Extraction follows: as the topic word. 2.4 Subtopic Extraction and  X  is as follows:  X  is weight for topic word decreases and the ot her words X  weight increases. Thus, subtopic threshold  X   X  , and then subtopic words are extracted by the same process described in Section 2.3. 2.5 Topicality and Locality Calculation pears more frequently in the nearest three days than in the nearest seven days. There-significantly larger than the number of long-term occurrences. determine the topicality by testing the null hypothesis  X  X he short-term occurrence also follows the rectangular distribution in the same way as the long-term occurrence X  with Z test. 
If the probability of occurrence of a document follows rectangular distribution, we can assume that the distribution of the number of documents that occurred in the latest  X   X  X , X  X  X   X   X 1 X   X   X  . Thus, the value of Z with the number of observed documents in the latest  X  days  X   X  is calculated with higher the topic is ranked. In this paper, we used one day for the short term and three days for the long term. 
For finding a local event, locality is also important. When a hot topic appears only in a place, it will be a local event, while a hot topic which appears in many places is not a local event but a pervasive event. In fact, events that share the same topic word are removed in this process. 
Finally, topics sorted by topicality score are shown as Figure 2. We investigated to what degree extracted topics are appropriate as local events. 3.1 Topic Extraction Test Collection from Local Blogs extracted to investigate the types of events that could be extracted. 
Figure 3 shows the distribution of the number of blog entries. From this data it was found that there were 95 stations with 100 or more blog entries per day on average, a number of entries is sufficient for detecting transitory events in large urban areas. tion set and the non-vague location set. 
The vague location is a location whose name is used not only for the local area but word may be used not only for the station name or the city itself but also for the last name of a person. Station and its vicinity. vague location set from locations with 10,000 or more blog entries in the first half of December 2008 (Table 1). 3.2 Extraction Accuracy We investigated the extent to which extract ed topics are recognized as local events. 
Two subjects rated to what degree each t opic seems to be a local event according location-date pair, at most five events are rated. 
Each subject determined relevance ratings based on whether or not he found both  X  what kind of event or who are involved, and  X  where (specific location) the event occurs or occurred. events X  column means the number of extracted events, the  X  X elevance X  column means user X  column means the percentage of relevant topics (at least one subject rated 2). 
From Table 2, we found there is a large difference in relevance score between non-vague locations (70.5%) and vague locations (60.2%). It is because of the ambiguity of place names from vague locations, as we mentioned in Section 3.1. We also found extracted as a topic word or a subtopic word because these terms are written in vari-ous representations and it makes C-value of these terms smaller. events. In Table 3, the  X  X indability of events X  column means the percentage for which 
Table 3 shows that at least one subject found one or more events for 77.0% of sets user can find some events by 77% for each location. because of the difference of document well-formedness between EPG documents and blog RSS documents. 
Figure 4(a) shows the relevance for non-vague locations and Figure 4(b) shows the relevance for vague locations. From Figure 4, most non-vague locations achieved 0.6 or more relevance, while only 4 vague locations achieved 0.6 or more relevance. 3.3 Feature of Extracted Events spots:  X  events held near a station (e.g., performances, such as a music group),  X 
Hokkaido souvenir festival (temporary souvenir shops),  X 
Ome marathon (sports event),  X 
Tokyo Auto Salon 2009 (a motor show), and  X  Kenya Hara design event (an artist-related event in an art museum). incidents broadcast on news websites were also extracted. 
However, problems related to place names were also revealed. One problem is the ambiguity of some place names from vague locations as mentioned in the above sec-results in unrelated topics becoming connected. In addition, some real estate informa-tion was also found. This information, though it may sometimes be useful, is not used for extracting events. Our future research efforts will focus on solving these problems and improving the extraction results. frequently over a period of time [3], and this technology is based on term-weighting theories, topicality calculation theories, and sentence modeling theories [5]. other methods such as TF*PDF [3] that focus on some feature of topic extraction have widely used [10]. Another approach is to use the Aging Theory that models a topic X  X  life cycle of birth, growth, decay, and d eath [4]. For sentence modeling theories, vec-tor space models are widely used and achieved the best results [11]. were successfully used [10]. 
Though we used common techniques for hot topic extraction, two new features are shown in this paper: one is the focus on local events using blog documents instead of extracting news topic from well-formed documents, and the other is the use of a two-approach focuses on how the hotness of a given topic changes spatiotemporally from weblog data collected with a topic term such as  X  X urricane Katrina X  with a probabilis-tic approach, where our approach is based on a clustering approach. 
Moreover, the focus of this paper is not only on extracting local events but also on presenting the topic in a set of terms for mobile use. 
There are also previous works on information presentation for mobile terminals with a small display, e.g., text summarization [13] and search result summarization [17]. We paper will be another successful presentation style for mobile terminals. queries including place names. An empirical investigation was also conducted into the tracted topics. From these investigations, we confirmed that the proposed method was common web search engines or the burst detection method. information systems.
