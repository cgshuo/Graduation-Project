 2. Background
Examining formal ontologies such as DOLCE-Lite, 9 SUMO-OWL, other notions, possibly with the participation of specialists in such concepts. ontology that requires either non-monotonic [19] or imprecise reasoning [20]. theories and examples ( Sections 2.4 and 2.5). 2.1. Ontological distinctions assumed in DOLCE. This will make Section 2.2 more comprehensible. papers are physical endurants.

On top of the above, non-physical endurants have another distinction adapted from [21]: 2.1.1. Information object and description system concrete entities).

Example 3. OWL, Prolog, 16 Spanish, among others are description systems. 2.2. Basic concepts semantic order (the most foundational concepts are listed first) as follows:  X   X   X  language is a description system.  X 
Ontology :  X  An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation .A that the ontology should be machine readable, which excludes natural language. consensual knowledge, that is, it is not private to some individual, but accepted by a group. can continue to exist although no one uses it. As a consequence, the meaning of match with the definition of  X  ontology  X  as a discipline.  X  law, enterprise, and automobile ( [24], page 33).  X

X   X   X  should be part of the ontology requirements specification document (ORSD). 2.3. Formal concept analysis definitions useful for our work.

De fi elements are called attributes, and I is a binary relation between G and M (that is, I g  X  G has the attribute m  X  M ([27], page 179).

X p G and Y p M as follows [26]:  X 
X d  X  { m  X  M |( g , m )  X  I  X  g  X  X }. For example, {morphine, pentazocine}  X 
Y d  X  { g  X  G |( g , m )  X  I  X  m  X  Y }. For instance, {interacts with ethyl alcohol, opiate}
De fi nition 2. A formal concept of a FC K =( G , M , I ) is defined as a pair ( A , B ) with A called the extent and the intent of the formal concept ( A , B ), respectively. 4.

De fi nition 3. We say that concept ( A 1 , B 1 ) is a subconcept of ( A because the set of objects of C 1 is a subset of the set of objects of C of C subconcept of C 2 , then they are related by a line, and C
De fi nition 4. A many-valued FC is a tuple K =( G , M ,( W m ) whose elements are called attributes; W m is the set of possible values for the attribute m with the constraint ( g , m , w 1 )  X  ( g , m , w 2 )  X  w m  X  M ([27], page 184).
  X 
G= {option 1, ... , option 4};  X 
M = {feature 1, ... , feature 3};  X   X   X 
De fi nition 5. A conceptual scale for a subset B p M of attributes is a (one-valued) FC S Therefore, S B =( G B , M B , I B ), where G B = {high, low} is the set of objects; M greater or equal to low.
 Consequently, S B =( G B , M B , I B ), where G B = {yes, poorly} is the set of objects, M I is the relation shown in Table 3.b.

De fi nition 6. Let S be the set of conceptual scales for the many-valued FC K =( G , M ,( W K =( G , M S , I S ), where  X 
M S ={( m , w )| m  X  M , w  X  W m }; and  X  ( g ,( m,w ))  X  I S if and only if there exists v  X  W m , a scale S
Example 10. If K is the FC of Example 7, then  X   X 
M S = {feature 1 &gt; low, feature 1 &gt; high, ... , feature 3 &gt; yes}.  X  I
S is the relation shown in Table 4 .  X  (option 1, feature 1 &gt;low)  X  I S because (option 1, feature 1, high) feature 2 is more important. 2.4. Meronymy, mereology and mereologies part theory 18 of parts and associated concepts [9,3]. We can say Most authors agree on the following core of axioms and definitions [16]. Axiom 1 (re fl exivity). Every object of the universe of the discourse is a part of itself. Axiom 3 (transitivity). If x is part of y , and y is part of z , then x is part of z . of  X  A number of additional mereological predicates can be introduced by their definition:
De fi nition 7. A proper part is a part that is not the individual itself.
De fi
De fi common part.

De fi common whole.

De fi nition 11. The disjoint relation is the logical negation of overlaps . 2.5. Time modeling ontologies. These notions are based on [12]  X  ways of defining the concept of time point, see [35].  X 
Hayes [58] also studies different ways of defining the concept of time interval.  X  another fact.

Example 13. Drug 2 was registered later than drug 1.  X  Open and closed intervals . Interval endpoints may or may not be inside the interval.
Example 14. The interval [1985, 1986) is closed on the left and open on the right.  X  Proper intervals . An interval with different endpoints is called a proper interval [39].
Example 15. [1985, 1986] is a proper interval, but [1985, 1985] is not  X  Temporal granularities refer to the detail level used to represent temporal entities. Example 16. The duration of an event in days can be converted into minutes. an interval between two different calendar days into working days [40].  X 
Total ordering . Total ordering means that, for every pair of time points t systems.

Example 17. The time point t 1 at which process P 1 is started on machine M machine M 2 may not be linked by either relation t 1 b t 2 shared resources. 3.

This heuristic has the purpose of ensuring the right meaning of part_of and proper_part_of . Example 27. The CQ on Pharmacia Iberia X  in Example 26 works thanks to the reflexivity of part_of . antisymmetry of the part_of relation.
