 The PIKM workshop gives Ph.D. students an opportunity to present their dissertation proposals at a global stage. Simi-larly to the CIKM, the PIKM workshop covers a wide range of topics in the areas of databases, information retrieval and knowledge management. Interdisciplinary work across these tracks is particularly encouraged.

The PIKM is the Ph.D. workshop of the CIKM confer-ence. One of the goal of the workshop is to give doctoral students an opportunity to present their work in an early stage to a global audience. This allows the students to de-scribe their ideas into a scientific article, to practice scientific presentation, and to receive feedback from reviewers, fellow students, and the general CIKM audience. We believe that the research community, too, benefits from such a workshop: Ph.D. theses are the grassroots of research. They point out new research avenues and indicate current promising topics. Keynote Speaker. Professor Pierre Senellart from T  X  el  X e-com ParisTech, France, is the keynote speaker at PIKM 2013. The title of his talk is Disseminate your Research: Style Does Matter .
 Best Paper Award. The best paper at the PIKM work-shop, as determined by the reviews of the program com-mittee members, always receives a best paper award. This year X  X  award will go to Avirup Sil for the paper Exploring Re-ranking Approaches for Joint Named-Entity Recognition and Linking [10]. The paper outlines interesting techniques for performing jointly the named entity recognition and en-tity linking tasks commonly used in information extraction. Best Reviewer Award. For his very thorough reviews, this year the best reviewer award goes to Sebastian Riedel, University College London, UK.
 Review Article. We plan to write a review article that summarizes the proceedings of the PIKM 2013. Such articles have been published before, in SIGIR Forum [14], SIGKDD Explorations [12], and SIGMOD Record [5, 2] for previous PIKM workshops.
