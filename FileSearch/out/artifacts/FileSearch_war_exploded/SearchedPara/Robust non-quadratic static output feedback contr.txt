Let us consider the class of uncertain and disturbed TS fuzzy systems described by: appropriate dimensions and f s i t  X  X  uncertain matrices bounded such that f s i t  X  X  T f s i t  X  X  r I . where L 1 A R m q and W 5 i A R q q are real gain matrices to be synthesized. unmeasured variables will be illustrated through the example of a crane system provided in Section 6.3. where A h  X  A h  X  D A h t  X  X  , B h  X  B h  X  D B h t  X  X  , C h  X  C h  X  D C h t  X  X  and D h  X  D h  X  D D h t  X  X  yt  X  X  . how this problem of crossing terms in the closed-loop dynamics may be overcame. rewritten as: and considering the extended state vector ~ xt  X  X   X  x T t  X  X  y T t  X  X  u T t  X  X  descriptor: with and 4.

Proof. The stability of the closed-loop system (10) is guaranteed, under the constraint (29) , if: which is obviously satisfied if: Following the same way as for the proof of Theorem 1 , (36) is satisfied if (32) holds as well as: note that using the Schur complement and Lemma 2 , (30) and 31 ) yield.
