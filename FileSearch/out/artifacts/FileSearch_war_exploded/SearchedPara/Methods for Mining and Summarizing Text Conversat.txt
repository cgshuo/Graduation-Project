 I.2 [ Computing Methodologies ]: Artificial Intelligence; I.7 [ Computing Methodologies ]: Document and Text Processing Text Mining, Text Summarizati on, Text Conversations, Topic Modeling, Opinion Mining, Email, (Micro)Blog, Discussion Forums, Social Media,. More and more today, people ar e engaging in conversations via email, blogs, discussion forums, text messaging and other social media. A person may want to ar chive these conversations and later retrieve information about wh at was discussed, or analyze a conversations? What opinions ar e people expressing? Have any decisions been made? Have ac tion items been assigned? This tutorial will present vari ous natural language processing (NLP) techniques that can help answer these questions, thus creating numerous new and valuable applications that can support people in more effectively partic ipating in these conversation. The tutorial is based on a book that we have recently published, Methods for Mining and Summarizi ng Text Conversations [1]. This tutorial should be suitable for researchers who have a background in Computer Science, Information Science or Linguistics, but only minimal exposure to Natural Language Processing. We assume the audience to be at least somewhat familiar with basic probability and basic machine learning. If most of the audience will lack such a background, we will be ready to provide a quick and gentle introduction to the key ideas and techniques. Our tutorial will be based on a book we have recently published: [1] G. Carenini and G. Murray and R. Ng, Methods for Mining and Summarizing Text Conversations , Morgan Claypool, 2011  X  The book is freely available onlin e at subscribing institutions (which include most universities and research labs). This is a new tutorial, so we do not already have presentation material for it. However, we have presented rela ted material in several invited talks and university lectures. For instance, Dr. Murray was the invited speaker at the summarization workshop at ACL 2011. Dr. Carenini has recently presented work on mining conversations at the AT&amp;T Labs and at IBM Research. People attending this tutorial will learn about a set of computational methods to extract information from conversational data, and to provide natural language summaries of the data. (30 mins) The tutorial will start with an overview of basic concepts by examining a simple written conversation. We will clarify fundamental differences; for instance, between topic segmentation and topic labelling and between extractive and abstractive summaries. After this, students will learn about metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of summarization and various extraction tasks. They will also become familiar with some of the benchmark corpora used in the literature. (1 hour) In the second part of the tutorial student will learn about extraction and mining methods for performing subjectivity and sentiment detection, topic segm entation and modeling, and the extraction of conversational structure. Our focus will be on clarifying how methods develope d for generic text can be extended to work on conversational data, such as meeting transcripts (which exemplify synchronous conversations) and emails (which exem plify asynchronous conversations). Very recent approaches to deal with blogs, discussion forums and microblogs (e.g.,Twitter) will be also discussed by interactively exploring several examples. (1 hour) In the third part of the tutorial, students will learn about natural language summarization of conversational data. We will initially provide a critical overview of several extractive and abstractive summarizers developed for emails, m eetings, blogs and forums. Then, we will describe our own recent attempts for building multi-modal summarizers. discussion on the future of the research on mining and summarizing conversations with a special focus on how this research can be informed by and be beneficial to research and applications in information retrieval. With the phenomenal growth in the amount of text conversations stored in computer memory comes the need for supporting effective search. Generally speaking, the ability to mine and summarize text can benefit any Web search. The more information that can be extracted from text, the more search can be based on the extracted information, rather than on simple matching with the words in the query. For instance, the reader may be very interested in browsing through all the sentences expressing negative opinions, sentences that represent action items, or sentences that describe decisions made. Moreover, if any document can be effectively summarized, the improved by presenting a summary as the snippet for each returned documents. Arguably, thes e advantages would also apply to a search engine for text conversations that relies on the possible to extract topics a nd opinions from conversations, a conversational search engine c ould support queries like:  X  X hat messages in the company blogs express opinions on the new budget? X . And the output of such search query could be a list of relevant messages summarized in the context of both the query and the conversation. Dr. Giuseppe Carenini is an associate professor in computer science at the University of British Columbia, UBC (BC, Canada), with broad interdisci plinary interests. His work on combining natural language processing and information visualization to support decision making has been published in over 70 peer-reviewed papers. Dr. Carenini was the area chair for  X  X entiment Analysis, Opinion Mining, and Text Classification X  of ACL 2009 and he is currently the area chair for  X  X ummarization and Generation X  of NAACL 2012. He has recently co-edited an ACM-TIST Special Issue on  X  X ntelligent Visual Interfaces for Text Analysis X . In July 2011, he has published a co-authored book on  X  X ethods for Mining and Summarizing Text Conversations X . In his work, Dr . Carenini has also extensively collaborated with industrial pa rtners, including Microsoft and IBM. Dr. Gabriel Murray has just recently joined as an assistant professor the dept. of CS of the University of the Fraser Valley, UFV, (BC, Canada). His bac kground is in natural language processing as well as theoretical linguistics. Dr. Murray has an established research record in the area of automatic summarization, with particular attention to summarization of noisy genres such as speech and web data, and comparison of abstractive and extractive techniques. He did his graduate studies at the University of Edinburgh under Dr. Steve Renals, was a member of the EU-funded AMI project on studying multimodal interaction. Before joining UFV, Dr. Murray was a researcher at UBC with the NSERC Business Intelligence Network on intelligent data management and decision making. While at UBC, he also gained substantial teaching experience. In July 2011, Dr. Murray has published a co-authored book on  X  X ethods for Mining and Summarizing Text Conversations X .
