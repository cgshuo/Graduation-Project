 How can we extract social meaning from speech, de-ciding if a speaker is particularly engaged in the con-versation, is uncomfortable or awkward, or is partic-ularly friendly and flirtatious? Understanding these meanings and how they are signaled in language is an important sociolinguistic task in itself. Extracting them automatically from dialogue speech and text is crucial for developing socially aware computing systems for tasks such as detection of interactional problems or matching conversational style, and will play an important role in creating more natural dia-logue agents (Pentland, 2005; Nass and Brave, 2005; Brave et al., 2005).

Cues for social meaning permeate speech at every level of linguistic structure. Acoustic cues such as low and high F0 or energy and spectral tilt are impor-tant in detecting emotions such as annoyance , anger , sadness , or boredom (Ang et al., 2002; Lee and Narayanan, 2002; Liscombe et al., 2003), speaker characteristics such as charisma (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2005), or personality features like extro-version (Mairesse et al., 2007; Mairesse and Walker, 2008). Lexical cues to social meaning abound. Speakers with links to depression or speakers who are under stress use more first person singular pro-nouns (Rude et al., 2004; Pennebaker and Lay, 2002; Cohn et al., 2004), positive emotion words are cues to agreeableness (Mairesse et al., 2007), and neg-ative emotion words are useful cues to deceptive speech (Newman et al., 2003). The number of words in a sentence can be a useful feature for extroverted personality (Mairesse et al., 2007). Finally, dia-log features such as the presence of disfluencies can inform listeners about speakers X  problems in ut-terance planning or about confidence (Brennan and Williams, 1995; Brennan and Schober, 2001).

Our goal is to see whether cues of this sort are useful in detecting particular elements of conversa-tional style and social intention; whether a speaker in a speed-dating conversation is judged by the in-terlocutor as friendly , awkward , or flirtatious . Our experiments make use of a new corpus we have collected, the SpeedDate Corpus. The corpus is based on three speed-dating sessions run at an elite private American university in 2005 and inspired by prior speed-dating research (Madan et al., 2005; Pentland, 2005). The graduate student participants volunteered to be in the study and were promised emails of persons with whom they reported mutual liking. Each date was conducted in an open setting where there was substantial background noise. All participants wore audio recorders on a shoulder sash, thus resulting in two audio recordings of the approx-imately 1100 4-minute dates. In addition to the au-dio, we collected pre-test surveys, event scorecards, and post-test surveys. This is the largest sample we know of where audio data and detailed survey infor-mation were combined in a natural experiment.
The rich survey information included date per-ceptions and follow-up interest, as well as gen-eral attitudes, preferences, and demographic infor-mation. Participants were also asked about the conversational style and intention of the interlocu-tor. Each speaker was asked to report how of-ten their date X  X  speech reflected different conversa-tional styles (awkward, friendly, flirtatious, funny, assertive) on a scale of 1-10 (1=never, 10=con-stantly):  X  X ow often did the other person behave in the following ways on this  X  X ate X ? X . We chose three of these five to focus on in this paper.

We acquired acoustic information by taking the acoustic wave file from each recorder and manually segmenting it into a sequence of wavefiles, each cor-responding to one 4-minute date. Since both speak-ers wore microphones, most dates had two record-ings, one from the male recorder and one from the female recorder. Because of mechanical, opera-tor, and experimenter errors, some recordings were lost, and thus some dates had only one recording. Transcribers at a professional transcription service used the two recordings to create a transcript for each date, and time-stamped the start and end time of each speaker turn. Transcribers were instructed to mark various disfluencies as well as some non-verbal elements of the conversation such as laughter.
Because of noise, participants who accidentally turned off their mikes, and some segmentation and transcription errors, a number of dates were not pos-sible to analyze. 19 dates were lost completely, and for an additional 130 we lost one of the two audio tracks and had to use the remaining track to extract features for both interlocutors. The current study fo-cuses on the 991 remaining clean dates for which we had usable audio, transcripts, and survey infor-mation. Our goal is to detect three of the style variables, in particular awkward, friendly, or flirtatious speakers, via a machine learning classifier. Recall that each speaker in a date (each conversation side) was la-beled by his or her interlocutor with a rating from 1-10 for awkward, friendly, or flirtatious behavior. For the experiments, the 1-10 Likert scale ratings were first mean-centered within each respondent so that the average was 0. Then the top ten percent of the respondent-centered meaned Likert ratings were marked as positive for the trait, and the bottom ten percent were marked as negative for a trait. Thus each respondent labels the other speaker as either positive, negative, or NA for each of the three traits.
We run our binary classification experiments to predict this output variable.

For each speaker side of each 4-minute conversa-tion, we extracted features from the wavefiles and the transcript, as described in the next section. We then trained six separate binary classifiers (for each gender for the 3 tasks), as described in Section 5. In selecting features we drew on previous research on the use of relatively simple surface features that cue social meaning, described in the next sections.
Each date was represented by the two 4-minute wavefiles, one from the recorder worn by each speaker, and a single transcription. Because of the very high level of noise, the speaker wearing the recorder was much clearer on his/her own recording, and so we extracted the acoustic features for each speaker from their own microphone (except for the 130 dates for which we only had one audio file). All lexical and discourse features were extracted from the transcripts.

All features describe the speaker of the conversa-tion side being labeled for style. The features for a conversation side thus indicate whether a speaker who talks a lot, laughs, is more disfluent, has higher F0, etc., is more or less likely to be considered flir-tatious, friendly, or awkward by the interlocutor. We also computed the same features for the alter inter-locutor. Alter features thus indicate the conversa-tional behavior of the speaker talking with an inter-locutor they considered to be flirtatious, friendly, or awkward. 4.1 Prosodic Features F0 and RMS amplitude features were extracted us-ing Praat scripts (Boersma and Weenink, 2005). Since the start and end of each turn were time-marked by hand, each feature was easily extracted over a turn, and then averages and standard devia-tions were taken over the turns in an entire conversa-tion side. Thus the feature F0 MIN for a conversation side was computed by taking the F0 min of each turn in that conversation side (not counting zero values of F0), and then averaging these values over all turns in the side. F0 MIN SD is the standard deviation across turns of this same measure.

Note that we coded four measures of f0 varia-tion, not knowing in advance which one was likely to be the most useful: F 0 MEAN SD is the deviation across turns from the global F0 mean for the con-versation side, measuring how variable the speakers mean f0 is across turns. F 0 SD is the standard devia-tion within a turn for the f0 mean, and then averaged over turns, hence measures how variable the speak-ers f0 is within a turn. F 0 SD SD measures how much the within-turn f0 variance varies from turn to turn, and hence is another measure of cross-turn f0 vari-ation. PITCH RANGE SD measures how much the speakers pitch range varies from turn to turn, and hence is another measure of cross-turn f0 variation. 4.2 Lexical Features Lexical features have been widely explored in the psychological and computational literature. For these features we drew mainly on the LIWC lexicons of Pennebaker et al. (2007), the standard for social psychological analysis of lexical features. From the large variety of lexical categories in LIWC we se-lected ten that the previous work of Mairesse et al. (2007) had found to be very significant in detect-ing personality-related features. The 10 LIWC fea-tures we used were Anger, Assent, Ingest, Insight, Negemotion, Sexual, Swear, I, We, and You . We also added two new lexical features,  X  X ast tense auxil-iary X , a heuristic for automatically detecting narra-tive or story-telling behavior, and Metadate , for dis-cussion about the speed-date itself. The features are summarized in Table 2. 4.3 Dialogue Act and Adjacency Pair Features A number of discourse features were extracted, drawing from the conversation analysis, disfluency and dialog act literature (Sacks et al., 1974; Juraf-sky et al., 1998; Jurafsky, 2001). While discourse features are clearly important for extracting social meaning, previous work on social meaning has met with less success in use of such features (with the exception of the  X  X ritical segments X  work of (Enos et al., 2007)), presumably because discourse fea-tures are expensive to hand-label and hard to auto-matically extract. We chose a suggestive discourse features that we felt might still be automatically ex-tracted.

Four particular dialog acts were chosen as shown in Table 3. Backchannels (or continuers) and ap-preciations (a continuer expressing positive affect) were coded by hand-built regular expressions. The regular expressions were based on analysis of the backchannels and appreciations in the hand-labeled Switchboard corpus of dialog acts (Jurafsky et al., 1997). Questions were coded simply by the pres-ence of question marks.

Finally, repair questions (also called NTRIs; next turn repair indicators) are turns in which a speaker signals lack of hearing or understanding (Schegloff et al., 1977). To detect these, we used a simple heuristic: the presence of  X  X xcuse me X  or  X  X ait X , as in the following example:
A collaborative completion is a turn where a speaker completes the utterance begun by the alter (Lerner, 1991; Lerner, 1996). Our heuristic for iden-tifying collaborative completions was to select sen-tences for which the first word of the speaker was extremely predictable from the last two words of the previous speaker. We trained a word trigram model 1 and used it to compute the probability p of the first word of a speaker X  X  turn given the last two words of the interlocutor X  X  turn. We arbitrarily chose the threshold .01, labeling all turns for which p &gt; . 01 as collaborative completions and used the total number of collaborative completions in a conversation side as our variable. This simple heuristic was errorful, but did tend to find completions beginning with and or or (1 below) and wh-questions followed by an NP or PP phrase that is grammatically coherent with the end of the question (2 and 3):
We also marked aspects of the preference struc-ture of language. A dispreferred action is one in which a speaker avoids the face-threat to the inter-locutor that would be caused by, e.g., refusing a request or not answering a question, by using spe-cific strategies such as the use of well , hesitations, or restarts (Schegloff et al., 1977; Pomerantz, 1984).
Finally, we included the number of instances of laughter for the side, as well as the total number of turns a speaker took. 4.4 Disfluency Features A second group of discourse features relating to re-pair, disfluency, and speaker overlap are summarized QUESTIONS number of questions in side LAUGH number of instances of laughter in side TURNS total number of turns in side in Table 4. Filled pauses ( um , uh ) were coded by
UH / UM total number of filled pauses ( uh or
RESTART total number of disfluent restarts in
OVERLAP number of turns in side which the two regular expressions (the transcribers had been in-structed to transcribe all filled pauses). Restarts are a type of repair in which speakers begin a phrase, break off, and then restart the syntactic phrase. The following example shows a restart; the speaker starts a sentence Uh, I and then restarts, There X  X  a group... :
Overlaps are cases in which both speakers were talking at the same time, and were marked by the transcribers in the transcripts: Before performing the classification task, we prepro-cessed the data in two ways. First, we standardized all the variables to have zero mean and unit variance. We did this to avoid imposing a prior on any of the features based on their numerical values. 2 Second, we removed features correlated greater than .7. One goal of removing correlated features was to remove as much colinearity as possible from the regression so that the regression weights could be ranked for their importance in the classification. In addition, we hoped to improve classification because a large number of features require more training examples (Ng, 2004). For example for male flirt we removed f0 range (highly correlated with f0 max ), f0 min sd (highly correlated with f0 min ), and Swear (highly correlated with Anger ).

For each classification task due to the small amounts of data we performed k -fold cross vali-dation to learn and evaluate our models. We used a variant of k -fold cross validation with five folds where three folds are used for training, one fold is used for validation, and one fold is used as a test set. This test fold is not used in any training step. This yields a datasplit of 60% for training, 20% for val-idation, and 20% for testing, or 120 training exam-ples, 40 validation examples, and 40 test examples. To ensure that we were not learning something spe-cific to our data split, we randomized our data order-ing and repeated the k -fold cross validation variant 25 times.

We used regularized logistic regression for clas-sification. Recall that in logistic regression we train a vector of feature weights  X   X  R n so as to make the following classification of some output variable y for an input observation x : 3
In regularized logistic regression we find the weights  X  which maximize the following optimiza-tion problem:
R (  X  ) is a regularization term used to penalize large weights. We chose R (  X  ) , the regularization function, to be the L 1 norm of  X  . That is, R (  X  ) = ||  X  || 1 = In our case, given the training set S train , test set S test , and validation set S val , we trained the weights  X  as follows: where for a given sparsity parameter  X   X   X  = argmax We chose L 1 -regularization because the number of training examples to learn well grows logarithmi-cally with the number of input variables (Ng, 2004), and to achieve a sparse activation of our features to find only the most salient explanatory variables. This choice of regularization was made to avoid the problems that often plague supervised learning in situations with large number of features but only a small number of examples. The search space over the sparsity parameter  X  is bounded around an ex-pected sparsity to prevent overfitting.

Finally, to evaluate our model on the learned  X  and  X   X  we used the features X of the test set S test to compute the predicted outputs Y using the logistic regression model. Accuracy is simply computed as the percent of correct predictions.

To avoid any data ordering bias, we calculated a  X   X  for each randomized run. The output of the runs was a vector of weights for each feature. We kept any feature if the median of its weight vector was nonzero. 4 A sample boxplot for the highest weighted ego features for predicting male flirt can be found in Figure 1. Results for the 6 binary classifiers are presented in Table 5.
 Speaker 63% 51% 67% 60% 72% 68% +other 64% 64% 71% 60% 73% 75%
The first row shows results using features ex-tracted from the speaker being labeled. Here, all conversational styles are easiest to detect in men.
The second row of table 5 shows the accuracy when using features from both speakers. Not sur-prisingly, adding information about the interlocutor tends to improve classification, and especially for women, suggesting that male speaking has greater sway over perceptions of conversational style. We discuss below the role of these features.

We first considered the features that helped clas-sification when considering only the ego (i.e., the re-sults in the first row of Table 5). Table 6 shows fea-ture weights for the features (features were normed so weights are comparable), and is summarized in the following paragraphs:  X  Men who are labeled as friendly use you , col-laborative completions, laugh, overlap, but don X  X  backchannel or use appreciations. Their utterances are shorter (in seconds and words) and they are qui-eter and their (minimum) pitch is lower and some-what less variable.  X  Women labeled as friendly have more collab-orative completions, repair questions, laughter, and appreciations. They use more words overall, and use I more often. They are more disfluent (both restarts and uh ) but less likely to swear. Prosodically their f0 is higher, and there seems to be some pattern involv-ing quiet speech; more variation in intensity mini-mum than intensity max.  X  Men who are labeled as flirting ask more ques-tions, including repair questions, and use you . They don X  X  use backchannels or appreciations, or overlap as much. They laugh more, and use more sexual and negative emotional words. Prosodically they speak faster, with higher and more variable pitch, but qui-eter (lower intensity max).  X  The strongest features for women who are la-beled as flirting are prosodic; they speak faster and louder with higher and more variable pitch. They also use more words in general, swear more, don X  X  ask questions or use Assent, use more I, laugh more, and are somewhat more disfluent (restarts).  X  Men who are labeled as awkward are more dis-fluent, with increased restarts and filled pauses ( uh and um ). They are also not  X  X ollaborative X  conversa-tionalists; they don X  X  use appreciations, repair ques-tions, collaborative completions, past-tense, or you , take fewer turns overall, and don X  X  overlap. Prosod-ically the awkward labels are hard to characterize; there is both an increase in pitch variation (f0 sd sd) and a decrease (f0 mean sd). They don X  X  seem to get quite as loud (intensity max).

The previous analysis showed what features of the ego help in classification. We next asked about fea-tures of the alter, based on the results using both ego and alter features in the second row of Table 5. Here we are asking about the linguistic behaviors of a speaker who describes the interlocutor as flirting, friendly, or awkward.

While we don X  X  show these values in a table, we offer here an overview of their tendencies. For example for women who labeled their male in-terlocutors as friendly, the women got much qui-eter, used  X  X ell X  much more, laughed, asked more repair questions, used collaborative completions, and backchanneled more. When a man labeled a woman as friendly, he used an expanded intensity range (quieter intensity min, louder intensity max). laughed more, used more sexual terms, used less negative emotional terms, and overlapped more.
When women labeled their male interlocutor as flirting, the women used many more repair ques-tions, laughed more, and got quieter (lower intensity min). By contrast, when a man said his female inter-locutor was flirting, he used more Insight and Anger words, and raised his pitch.

When women labeled their male interlocutor as awkward, the women asked a lot of questions, used well , were disfluent (restarts), had a diminished pitch range, and didn X  X  use I . In listening to some of these conversations, it was clear that the conver-sation lagged repeatedly, and the women used ques-tions at these points to restart the conversations. The results presented here should be regarded with some caution. The sample is not a random sample of English speakers or American adults, and speed dat-ing is not a natural context for expressing every con-versational style. Therefore, a wider array of studies across populations and genres would be required be-fore a more general theory of conversational styles is established.

On the other hand, the presented results may under-reflect the relations being captured. The qual-ity of recordings and coarse granularity (1 second) of the time-stamps likely cloud the relations, and as the data is cleaned and improved, we expect the as-sociations to only grow stronger.

Caveats aside, we believe the evidence indicates that the perception of several types of conversational style have relatively clear signals across genders, but with some additional gender contextualization.
Both genders convey flirtation by laughing more, speaking faster, and using higher and more variable pitch. Both genders convey friendliness by laughing more, and using collaborative completions.

However, we do find gender differences; men asl more questions when (labeled as) flirting, women ask fewer. Men labeled as flirting are softer, but women labeled as flirting are louder. Women flirt-ing swear more, while men are more likely to use sexual vocabulary. Gender differences exist as well for the other variables. Men labeled as friendly use you while women labeled as friendly use I . Friendly women are very disfluent; friendly men are not.
While the features for friendly and flirtatious speech overlap, there are clear differences. Men speaker faster and with higher f0 (min) in flirtatious speech, but not faster and with lower f0 (min) in friendly speech. For men, flirtatious speech involves more questions and repair questions, while friendly speech does not. For women, friendly speech is more disfluent than flirtatious speech, and has more collaborative style (completions, repair questions, appreciations).

We also seem to see a model of collaborative con-versational style (probably related to the collabo-rative floor of Edelsky (1981) and Coates (1996)), cued by the use of more collaborative completions, repair questions and other questions, you , and laugh-ter. These collaborative techniques were used by both women and men who were labeled as friendly, and occurred less with men labeled as awkward. Women themselves displayed more of this collab-orative conversational style when they labeled the men as friendly. For women only, collaborative style included appreciations; while for men only, collabo-rative style included overlaps.

In addition to these implications for social sci-ence, our work has implications for the extraction of meaning in general. A key focus of our work was on ways to extract useful dialog act and disfluency fea-tures (repair questions, backchannels, appreciations, restarts, dispreferreds) with very shallow methods. These features were indeed extractable and proved to be useful features in classification.

We are currently extending these results to predict date outcomes including  X  X iking X , extending work such as Madan and Pentland (2006).
