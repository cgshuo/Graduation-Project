 Zhi-Hua Zhou  X  Hang Li  X  Qiang Yang This special issue consists of five selected papers from the 11th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD 2007) held in Nanjing, China in May 2007.
The PAKDD conference is a leading international conference in the areas of data mining and knowledge discovery. It provides an international forum for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all data mining-related areas, including machine learning, databases, sta-tistics, data warehousing, knowledge acquisition, automatic scientific discovery, data visu-alization, causal induction, knowledge-based systems, etc.
 PAKDD 2007 received 730 research paper submissions from 29 countries and regions in Asia, Australasia, Europe, North America, South America and Africa, of which 34 (4.6%) papers were accepted as regular papers and 92 (12.6%) papers as short papers. The five papers presented in this special issue are selected from among the best papers accepted in PAKDD 2007 in terms of their technical contributions and paper presentation. Authors of the papers have been invited to extend and improve their conference versions significantly based on the feedbacks from the conference, and comments and suggestions from additional reviewers. The paper  X  X  Hybrid Multi-Group Privacy Preserving Approach for Building Decision Trees X  by Zhouxuan Teng and Wenliang Du studies the problem of building privacy preserv-ing decision trees. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach which takes advantageous of the strength of both the randomization approach and the secure multi-party computation approach. This paper also proposes a multi-group scheme which enables the user to control the balance between accuracy and privacy.

The paper  X  X mbedding New Data Points for Manifold Learning via Coordinate Propaga-tion X  by Shiming Xiang, Feiping Nie, Yangqiu Song, Changshui Zhang and Chunxia Zhang proposes a method to map new test data points into the manifold learned from a training data set. The authors formulate the task of propagating known coordinates to the new data points as a quadratic programming problem and develop an iterative algorithm for coordinate propagation, which is validated on applications to camera direction and face pose estimation.
The paper  X  X irect Estimation of Class Membership Probabilities for Multiclass Classifica-tion Using Multiple Scores X  by Kazuko Takahashi, Hiroya Takamura and Manabu Okumura proposes a general direct approach for estimating class membership probability in multiclass classification, which uses multiple scores not only for a predicted class but also for other proper classes. Based on this approach, the paper develops a non-parametric method and a parametric method, and demonstrates their effectiveness in experiments.
 The paper  X  X bject Discovery in High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images: A Semantic Perspective X  by Dihua Guo, Hui Xiong, Vijayalakshmi Atluri and Nabil R. Adam proposes a semantic-aware two-stage image segmentation approach to preserve the semantics of real objects during segmentation process, and exploits a hyperclique pattern discovery method to find complex objects that consist of co-existing individual objects. The paper also considers the identified co-existing objects as new features for the learning model to achieve a better performance.
 The paper  X  X ultiresolution-based BiLinear Recurrent Neural Network X  by Dong-Chul Park proposes an extension to BiLinear Recurrent Neural Networks (BLRNN) for model-ing and predicting time series, which uses multiresolution-based learning algorithm to train BLRNN to improve the robustness. Applications to network traffic prediction and electric load forecasting show that the proposed MBLRNN outperforms BLRNN and multi-layer perceptron in predictive accuracy.

Before closing this editorial, we want to thank all authors for submitting their extended papers to this special issue, and all reviewers for providing invaluable comments and sugges-tions for improving the papers. We also want to express our gratitude to the KAIS Editors-in-Chief, Nick Cercone and Xindong Wu, and the editorial assistant, Edward Sarmiento, for their help which makes this issue possible.
