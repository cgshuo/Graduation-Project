 Relation Extraction (RE) is the process of gen-erating structured relation knowledge from un-structured natural language texts. Traditional su-pervised methods (Zhou et al., 2005; Bach and Badaskar, 2007) on small hand-labeled corpora, cision and recall. However, as producing hand-labeled corpora is laborius and expensive, the su-pervised approach can not satisfy the increasing Figure 1: Training corpus generated by the basic alignment assumption of distantly supervised re-lation extraction. The relation instances are the triples related to President Barack Obama in the Freebase, and the relation mentions are some sen-tences describing him in the Wikipedia. demand of building large-scale knowledge reposi-tories with the explosion of Web texts. To address the lacking training data issue, we consider the dis-tant (Mintz et al., 2009) or weak (Hoffmann et al., 2011) supervision paradigm attractive, and we im-prove the effectiveness of the paradigm in this pa-per.

The intuition of the paradigm is that one can take advantage of several knowledge bases, heuristic alignment assumptions. An example accounting for the basic but practical assumption is illustrated in Figure 1, in which we know that the two entities ( &lt; Barack Obama, U.S. &gt; ) are not only involved in the rela-( President-of(Barack Obama, U.S.) and Born-in(Barack Obama, U.S.) ), appearing in free texts ( Barack Obama is the 44th and current President of the U.S. and Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S. , etc.). We extract diverse textual features from all those relation mentions and combine them into a rich feature vector labeled by the relation names ( President-of and Born-in ) to produce a weak training corpus for relation classification.
This paradigm is promising to generate large-scale training corpora automatically. However, it comes up against three technical challeges:  X  Sparse features . As we cannot tell what  X  Noisy features . Not all relation mentions  X  Incomplete labels . Similar to noisy fea-In essence, distantly supervised relation extrac-tion is an incomplete multi-label classification task with sparse and noisy features.

In this paper, we formulate the relation-extraction task from a novel perspective of using matrix completion with low rank criterion. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply this technique on relation extraction with distant super-vision. More specifically, as shown in Figure 2, we model the task with a sparse matrix whose rows present items (entity pairs) and columns contain noisy textual features and incomplete relation la-bels. In such a way, relation classification is trans-formed into a problem of completing the unknown labels for testing items in the sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels, based on the assumption that the item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrix is of low rank. The rationale of this assumption is that noisy features and incomplete labels are semantically correlated. The low-rank factoriza-tion of the sparse feature-label matrix delivers the low-dimensional representation of de-correlation for features and labels. We contribute two optimization models, DRM-parsity to recover the underlying low-rank matrix and to complete the unknown testing labels simul-taneously. Moreover, the logistic cost function is integrated in our models to reduce the influence of noisy features and incomplete labels, due to that it is suitable for binary variables. We also modify the fixed point continuation (FPC) algorithm (Ma et al., 2011) to find the global optimum.

Experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our noise-tolerant approaches outperform the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of feature sparsity, and our approaches consistently achieve better performance than compared meth-ods under different sparsity degrees. The idea of distant supervision was firstly pro-posed in the field of bioinformatics (Craven and Kumlien, 1999). Snow et al. (2004) used Word-Net as the knowledge base to discover more h-pyernym/hyponym relations between entities from news articles. However, either bioinformatic database or WordNet is maintained by a few ex-perts, thus hardly kept up-to-date.

As we are stepping into the big data era, the explosion of unstructured Web texts simulates us to build more powerful models that can automat-ically extract relation instances from large-scale online natural language corpora without hand-labeled annotation. Mintz et al. (2009) adopt-ed Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008; Bollacker et al., 2007), a large-scale crowdsourcing knowl-edge base online which contains billions of rela-tion instances and thousands of relation names, to distantly supervise Wikipedia corpus. The basic alignment assumption of this work is that if a pair of entities participate in a relation, all sentences that mention these entities are labeled by that rela-tion name. Then we can extract a variety of textu-al features and learn a multi-class logistic regres-sion classifier. Inspired by multi-instance learn-ing (Maron and Lozano-P  X  erez, 1998), Riedel et al. (2010) relaxed the strong assumption and replaced all sentences with at least one sentence . Hoff-mann et al. (2011) pointed out that many entity pairs have more than one relation. They extend-ed the multi-instance learning framework (Riedel et al., 2010) to the multi-label circumstance. Sur-deanu et al. (2012) proposed a novel approach to multi-instance multi-label learning for relation ex-traction, which jointly modeled all the sentences in texts and all labels in knowledge bases for a giv-en entity pair. Other literatures (Takamatsu et al., 2012; Min et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013) addressed more specific issues, like how to construct the negative class in learning or how to adopt more information, such as name en-tity tags, to improve the performance.

Our work is more relevant to Riedel et al. X  X  (2013) which considered the task as a matrix fac-torization problem. Their approach is composed of several models, such as PCA (Collins et al., 2001) and collaborative filtering (Koren, 2008). However, they did not concern about the data noise brought by the basic assumption of distant super-vision. We apply a new technique in the field of ap-plied mathematics, i.e., low-rank matrix comple-tion with convex optimization. The breakthrough work on this topic was made by Cand ` es and Recht (2009) who proved that most low-rank matrices can be perfectly recovered from an incomplete set of entries. This promising theory has been successfully applied on many active research ar-eas, such as computer vision (Cabral et al., 2011), recommender system (Rennie and Srebro, 2005) and system controlling (Fazel et al., 2001). Our models for relation extraction are based on the theoretic framework proposed by Goldberg et al. (2010), which formulated the multi-label trans-ductive learning as a matrix completion problem. The new framework for classification enhances the robustness to data noise by penalizing differen-t cost functions for features and labels. 3.1 Formulation Suppose that we have built a training corpus for relation classification with n items (entity pairs), d -dimensional textual features, and t labels (rela-tions), based on the basic alignment assumption proposed by Mintz et al. (2009). Let X train  X  and the label matrix for training, respectively. The linear classifier we adopt aims to explicitly learn the loss function l , arg min where 1 is the all-one column vector. Then we can predict the label matrix Y test  X  R m  X  t of m testing items with respect to the feature matrix X test  X  This linear classification problem can be trans-formed into completing the unobservable entries in Y test by means of the observable entries in X The model can be written as, where we use  X  X to represent the index set of ob-servable feature entries in X train and X test , and  X 
Y to denote the index set of observable label en-
Formula (2) is usually impractical for real prob-lems as the entries in the matrix Z are corrupted by noise. We thus define where Z  X  as the underlying low-rank matrix and E is the error matrix The rank function in Formula (2) is a non-convex function that is difficult to be optimized. The sur-rogate of the function can be the convex nucle-ar norm || Z ||  X  = 2009), where  X  k is the k -th largest singular val-ue of Z . To tolerate the noise entries in the error matrix E , we minimize the cost functions C x and C y for features and labels respectively, rather than using the hard constraints in Formula (2).
 can be represented as [ X  X  , W X  X  ] instead of [ X  X  ,Y  X  ] , by explicitly modeling the bias vector b . Therefore, this convex optimization model is called DRMC-b , arg min where  X  and  X  are the positive trade-off weights. More specifically, we minimize the nuclear norm || Z ||  X  via employing the regularization terms, i.e., the cost functions C x and C y for features and la-bels.
 If we implicitly model the bias vector b , [ 1 ,X  X  , W 0 X  X  ] instead of [ X  X  ,Y  X  ] , in which W takes the role of [ b T ; W ] in DRMC-b. Then we derive another optimization model called DRMC-1 , arg min where Z (: , 1) denotes the first column of Z .
For our relation classification task, both features and labels are binary. We assume that the actual entry u belonging to the underlying matrix Z  X  is randomly generated via a sigmoid function (Jor-dan, 1995): Pr ( u | v ) = 1 / (1 + e  X  uv ) , given the observed binary entry v from the observed sparse matrix Z . Then, we can apply the log-likelihood cost function to measure the conditional probabil-ity and derive the logistic cost function for C x and C
After completing the entries in Y test , we adop-t the sigmoid function to calculate the conditional probability of relation r j , given entity pair p i per-taining to y ij in Y test , Finally, we can achieve Top-N predicted relation instances via ranking the values of Pr ( r j | p i ) . The matrix rank minimization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, Cand  X  es and Recht (2009) sug-gested to use a convex relaxation, the nuclear nor-m minimization instead. Then, Ma et al. (2011) proposed the fixed point continuation (FPC) algo-rithm which is fast and robust. Moreover, Gold-frab and Ma (2011) proved the convergence of the FPC algorithm for solving the nuclear norm mini-mization problem. We thus adopt and modify the algorithm aiming to find the optima for our noise-tolerant models, i.e., Formulae (3) and (4). 4.1 Fixed point continuation for DRMC-b Algorithm 1 describes the modified FPC algorithm for solving DRMC-b, which contains two steps for each iteration,
Gradient step: In this step, we infer the ma-trix gradient g ( Z ) and bias vector gradient g ( b ) as follows, g ( z ij ) = and We use the gradient descents A = Z  X   X  z g ( Z ) and b = b  X   X  b g ( b ) to gradually find the global minima of the cost function terms in Formula (3), where  X  z and  X  b are step sizes.

Shrinkage step: The goal of this step is to min-imize the nuclear norm || Z ||  X  in Formula (3). We perform the singular value decomposition (SVD) (Golub and Kahan, 1965) for A at first, and then cut down each singular value. During the iteration, any negative value in  X   X   X  z  X  is assigned by zero, so that the rank of reconstructed matrix Z will be reduced, where Z = U max (  X   X   X  z  X , 0) V T .
To accelerate the convergence, we use a con-tinuation method to improve the speed.  X  is ini-tialized by a large value  X  1 , thus resulting in the fast reduction of the rank at first. Then the conver-gence slows down as  X  decreases while obeying  X  k +1 = max (  X  k  X   X  , X  F ) .  X  F is the final value of  X  , and  X   X  is the decay parameter.

For the stopping criteria in inner iterations, we define the relative error to measure the residual of matrix Z between two successive iterations, Algorithm 1 FPC algorithm for solving DRMC-b Input: Initial matrix Z 0 , bias b 0 ; Parameters  X , X  ; Step sizes  X  z , X  b .

Set Z = Z 0 , b = b 0 . foreach  X  =  X  1 &gt;  X  2 &gt; ... &gt;  X  F do end foreach Output: Completed Matrix Z , bias b . where  X  is the convergence threshold. 4.2 Fixed point continuation for DRMC-1 Algorithm 2 is similar to Algorithm 1 except for two differences. First, there is no bias vector b . Second, a projection step is added to enforce the first column of matrix Z to be 1 . In addition, The matrix gradient g ( Z ) for DRMC-1 is g ( z ij ) = Algorithm 2 FPC algorithm for solving DRMC-1 Input: Initial matrix Z 0 ; Parameters  X , X  ; Step sizes  X  z .

Set Z = Z 0 . foreach  X  =  X  1 &gt;  X  2 &gt; ... &gt;  X  F do end foreach Output: Completed Matrix Z . % with more than one label sets. In order to conduct reliable experiments, we adjust and estimate the parameters for our approaches, DRMC-b and DRMC-1, and compare them with other four kinds of landmark methods (Mintz et al., 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012; Riedel et al., 2013) on two public datasets. 5.1 Dataset The two widely used datasets that we adopt are both automatically generated by aligning Freebase NYT X 10, was developed by Riedel et al. (2010), and also used by Hoffmann et al. (2011) and Sur-deanu et al. (2012). Three kinds of features, name-ly, lexical, syntactic and named entity tag fea-tures, were extracted from relation mentions. The Riedel et al. (2013), in which they only regarded the lexicalized dependency path between two enti-ties as features. Table 1 shows that the two datasets differ in some main attributes. More specifically, NYT X 10 contains much higher dimensional fea-tures than NYT X 13, whereas fewer training and testing items. 5.2 Parameter setting In this part, we address the issue of setting param-eters: the trade-off weights  X  and  X  , the step sizes  X  z and  X  b , and the decay parameter  X   X  .

We set  X  = 1 to make the contribution of the cost function terms for feature and label matrices equal in Formulae (3) and (4).  X  is assigned by a series of values obeying  X  k +1 = max (  X  k  X   X  , X  F ) . We follow the suggestion in (Goldberg et al., 2010) that  X  starts at  X  1  X   X  , and  X  1 is the largest singular value of the matrix Z . We set  X   X  = 0 . 01 . The final value of  X  , namely  X  F , is equal to 0 . 01 . Ma et al. (2011) revealed that as long as the non-negative step sizes satisfy  X  z &lt; min ( 4 |  X  Y | tee to converge to a global optimum. Therefore, we set  X  z =  X  b = 0 . 5 to satisfy the above con-straints on both two datasets. 5.3 Rank estimation Even though the FPC algorithm converges in iter-ative fashion, the value of  X  varying with different datasets is difficult to be decided. In practice, we record the rank of matrix Z at each round of iter-ation until it converges at a rather small threshold mal low-rank representation of the matrix Z con-veys the truly effective information about underly-ing semantic correlation between the features and the corresponding labels.

We use the five-fold cross validation on the val-idation set and evaluate the performance on each fold with different ranks. At each round of itera-tion, we gain a recovered matrix and average the tion instances to measure the performance. Figure 3 illustrates the curves of average F1 scores. After recording the rank associated with the highest F1 score on each fold, we compute the mean and the standard deviation to estimate the range of optimal rank for testing. Table 2 lists the range of optimal ranks for DRMC-b and DRMC-1 on NYT X 10 and NYT X 13.
On both two datasets, we observe an identical phenomenon that the performance gradually in-creases as the rank of the matrix declines before reaching the optimum. However, it sharply de-creases if we continue reducing the optimal rank. An intuitive explanation is that the high-rank ma-trix contains much noise and the model tends to be overfitting, whereas the matrix of excessively low rank is more likely to lose principal information and the model tends to be underfitting. 5.4 Method Comparison Firstly, we conduct experiments to compare our approaches with Mintz-09 (Mintz et al., 2009), MultiR-11 (Hoffmann et al., 2011), MIML-12 and MIML-at-least-one-12 (Surdeanu et al., 2012) on NYT X 10 dataset. Surdeanu et al. (2012) released mental results on those previous methods. More-over, their programs can control the feature spar-sity degree through a threshold  X  which filters the features that appears less than  X  times. They set  X  = 5 in the original code by default. Therefore, we follow their settings and adopt the same way to filter the features. In this way, we guarantee the fair comparison for all methods. Figure 4 (a) shows that our approaches achieve the significant improvement on performance.

We also perform the experiments to compare (Riedel et al., 2013) and its sub-methods (N-13, F-13 and NF-13) on NYT X 13 dataset. Figure 4 (b) illustrates that our approaches still outperform the state-of-the-art methods. In practical application-s, we also concern about the precision on Top-N predicted relation instances. Therefore, We com-pare the precision of Top-100s, Top-200s and Top-500s for DRMC-1, DRMC-b and the state-of-the-Table 3: Precision of NFE-13, DRMC-b and DRMC-1 on Top-100, Top-200 and Top-500 pre-dicted relation instances. art method NFE-13 (Riedel et al., 2013). Table 3 shows that DRMC-b and DRMC-1 achieve 24.0% and 26.6% precision increments on average, re-spectively. We have mentioned that the basic alignment as-sumption of distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009) tends to generate noisy (noisy features and incomplete labels) and sparse (sparse features) da-ta. In this section, we discuss how our approaches tackle these natural flaws.

Due to the noisy features and incomplete label-s, the underlying low-rank data matrix with tru-ly effective information tends to be corrupted and the rank of observed data matrix can be extremely high. Figure 5 demonstrates that the ranks of da-ta matrices are approximately 2,000 for the initial optimization of DRMC-b and DRMC-1. Howev-er, those high ranks result in poor performance. As the ranks decline before approaching the op-timum, the performance gradually improves, im-plying that our approaches filter the noise in data and keep the principal information for classifica-tion via recovering the underlying low-rank data matrix.

Furthermore, we discuss the influence of the feature sparsity for our approaches and the state-ranks, respectively. of-the-art methods. We relax the feature filtering threshold (  X  = 4 , 3 , 2 ) in Surdeanu et al. X  X  (2012) open source program to generate more sparse fea-tures from NYT X 10 dataset. Figure 6 shows that our approaches consistently outperform the base-line and the state-of-the-art methods with diverse feature sparsity degrees. Table 2 also lists the range of optimal rank for DRMC-b and DRMC-1 with different  X  . We observe that for each ap-proach, the optimal range is relatively stable. In other words, for each approach, the amount of tru-ly effective information about underlying seman-tic correlation keeps constant for the same dataset, which, to some extent, explains the reason why our approaches are robust to sparse features. In this paper, we contributed two noise-tolerant for distantly supervised relation extraction task from a novel perspective. Our models are based on matrix completion with low-rank criterion. Exper-iments demonstrated that the low-rank represen-tation of the feature-label matrix can exploit the underlying semantic correlated information for re-lation classification and is effective to overcome the difficulties incurred by sparse and noisy fea-tures and incomplete labels, so that we achieved significant improvements on performance.

Our proposed models also leave open question-s for distantly supervised relation extraction task. First, they can not process new coming testing items efficiently, as we have to reconstruct the data matrix containing not only the testing items but al-so all the training items for relation classification, and compute in iterative fashion again. Second, the volume of the datasets we adopt are relatively small. For the future work, we plan to improve our models so that they will be capable of incremental learning on large-scale datasets (Chang, 2011).
