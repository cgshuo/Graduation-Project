 in a massive multidimensional graph. This graph essentially unifies both the searcher and the information resources that played a fundamentally different role in traditional IR, and offers major new ways to access relevant information. In ser-vices that rely on personalized information like social net-works, the graph plays an even more important role, in other words: you are the query .

Graph search affects both query formulation as well as result exploration and discovery. On the one hand, it al-lows for incrementally expressing complex information needs that triangulate information about multiple entities or entity types, relations between those entities, with various filters on geo-temporal constraints or the sources of information used (or ignored), and taking into account the rich profile and context information of the searcher (and his/her peers, and peers of peers, etc). On the other hand, it allows for more powerful ways to explore the results from various as-pects and viewpoints, by slicing and dicing the information using the graph structure, and using the same structure for explaining why results are retrieved or recommended, and by whom.

This new graph based information seeking approach in-troduces great opportunities, but also great challenges, both technical ranging from data quality and data integration to user interface design, as well as ethical challenges in terms of privacy; transparency, bias and control; and avoiding the so-called filter bubbles. Graph search is already available today in many flavors with different levels of interactivity. Social network-based services like Facebook and LinkedIn provide flexibility to search their personal network form many di-verse angles. Web search engines like Google and Bing rely more on using graphs to show related content as a mecha-nism to include other possible contexts for a given query. Clearly, it is not limited to web, and can be applied to other highly structured data. Just to give an example, the hansards or parliamentary proceedings are fully public data with a clear graph structure linking every speech to the re-spective speaker, their role in parliament and their political party. Graph search allows to explore politics from the view-point of individual members of parliament or government.
At a high level, graph search seems limited to familiar entity types (e.g., Facebook entities) and templates. How far can this scale? Will this work on truly open domains? There is a huge potential to use the graph to go beyond rec-ommendations for new friends and contacts or semantically related content. Unlocking the potential of richer knowledge sources for new search strategies requires us to think outside Privacy Access to personal data is fraught ethical and pri-
The workshop brought together researchers from a range of areas in information access, who worked together on search-ing information from your personal point of view over a highly structured and curated information space. One of the main lines of discussion was the considerable industrial activity around social graphs. The most famous example is Facebook Graph Search, a feature that allows users to per-form more sophisticated searches on their social network [1]. Bing has been integrating Facebook into their web search re-sults for the last couple of years. Similarly, Google has been annotating search results with Google+ profiles. And all the rest of the search industry is moving in the same direction.
There are also crucial links with work on searching struc-tured data, and work on the appropriate query languages, in particular as part of semantic search. These branches of research in particular focus on complex querying of struc-tured text or data, whereas the graph search addresses also, and perhaps primarily, the process of constructing series of complex queries interactively. This is directly related to ex-ploratory search and sense making. The graph structure provides natural facets for exploring the data, from a lo-cal point of view, allowing for a more dynamic structure than traditional faceted search using rigid, global, hierarchi-cal structure. This challenges our understanding of search user interfaces design and evaluation, with search results moving from the found links, to the HIT page as snippets, and now to query suggestion as previews of possible query extensions.

Graph Search has fundamental consequences for informa-tion access and offers tremendous opportunities for building new systems and tools that allow users to explore informa-tion from many different angles, shifting control back to the user. This is a radical departure from current systems where the machine learning dominate the interaction: the entire in-formation space is determined by the user, and the user is in the driver X  X  seat when expressing her needs and exploring the space of options interactive.
