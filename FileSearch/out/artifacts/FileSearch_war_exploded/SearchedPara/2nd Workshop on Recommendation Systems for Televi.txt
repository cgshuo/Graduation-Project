 The choice of what to watch becomes more overwhelming though because the entertainment options are scattered across various channels, such as on-demand video, digital recorders (on premise but also on their computers, phones, and tablet devices. Recommendation systems provide TV users with suggestions about both online video-on-dema nd and broadcast content and help them to search and browse intelligently for content that is relevant to them. While many open questions in video-on-demand recommendations have already been solved, recommendation systems for broadcast content (e.g., linear channels and catch-up TV) still experience a number of unique challenges due to the peculiarity of such domain. For example, the content available on linear channels is constantly changing and often only available once which leads to severe cold start problems and we often consume TV in groups of varying compositions (household vs individual) which makes building taste profiles and modeling consumer behavior very challenging. Finally, recommendation systems ha ve to address a number of very different consumption patterns, such as actively browsing through a list of personalized Video on Demand choices that match our current mood, compared to enjoying a  X  X ean back experience X  where a recommendation systems playlists a stream of TV shows from our favorite channels for us. The unique challenges and wi de-ranging applications of recommender systems in this domain motivated us to organize this workshop to bring together researchers from industry and academy in order to identify and share the key challenges, approaches and solutions of the field. The objective of this workshop is to encourage discussions among the researchers in the field, disseminate the latest approaches and encourage future collaborati on among the participants. We workshop activities and hopefully this will accelerate progress towards creating better recomme ndation systems for television and online video in the future. We thank the program committee for their help with reviewing the submissions: Bal X zs Hidasi, GravityR&amp;D Justin Basilico, Netflix Craig Carmichael, Rovi Emanuele Coviello, Keevio Paolo Cremonesi, Politecnico di Milano Joaquin Delgado, OnCue TV (Verizon) Diana Hu, OnCue TV (Verizon) Brendan Kitts, Adap.tv (AOL) Gert Lanckriet, UC San Diego Royi Ronen, Microsoft Barry Smyth, Insight Centre for Data Analytics Esti Widder, Viaccess-Orca D X vid Zibriczky, ImpressTV Jiayu Zhou, Samsung Research The workshop will consist of se veral key note and presentation sessions with contributions from both academic and industrial researchers. We will also have an industrial demo session to and online video recommendations.
