 1. Introduction
The secure operation of power system has become an important and critical issue in today X  X  large, complex, and load-increasing systems. Security constraints such as thermal limits of transmission lines and bus voltage limits must be satisfied under all system operation conditions. Commonly, Power systems are planned and operated based on the N 1 security criterion, which implies that the system should remain secure under all important first contingencies. One solution to cope with this problem is to design the system to meet the N 1 security criterion which is somewhat conservative and costly. An alternative solution to improve the security of power system is the flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices which is a concept proposed by Hingorani (1988) .

FACTS devices can reduce the flows of heavily loaded lines, maintain the bus voltages at desired levels, and improve the stability of the power network. Consequently, they can improve the power system security under contingency situations. Unified power flow controller (UPFC) is a versatile FACTS X  X  device which can independently or simultaneously control the active power, the reactive power, and the bus voltage to which it is connected (Gyugyi, 1992 ). However, to achieve such functionality of UPFC, it is highly important to determine the optimal location of this device in the power system with the appropriate parameter setting. Since
UPFC can be installed in different locations, its effectiveness will be different. Therefore, we will face the problem of where we should install UPFC. For this reason, some performance indices must be satisfied. The following are some factors that can be considered in the selection of the optimal installation and parameter setting of
UPFC: The stability margin improvement, the power transmission capacity increasing, and the power blackout prevention, etc.
Therefore, conventional power flow algorithm ( Puerle-Esquivel and Acha, 1997 ) should incorporate with UPFC and the optimiza-tion should consider one, two, or all of the above-mentioned factors. However, in this paper, we only consider blackout prevention, in other words, enhancing the security of power system under single line contingencies through installing UPFC in an optimal location with optimal parameter setting.
 for the optimal power flow incorporating with UPFC device as well as for the optimal placement of UPFC. Some of them are:
A sensitivity-based approach which has been developed for finding suitable placement of UPFC ( Singh and Erlich, 2005 ), an evolutionary-programming-based load flow algorithm for sys-tems containing unified power flow controllers ( Wang et al., 2003), a genetic algorithm which proposed for solving the optimal location problem of UPFC ( Arabkhaburi et al., 2006 ), and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) for optimal location of FACTS devices (Saravanan, 2005 ).

Also a lot of work has been done in the contingency analysis research area. Operation scheme of FACTS devices to enhance the power system steady-state security level considering a line contingency analysis is suggested in Song et al. (2004) . A method for contingency selection and security enhancement of power systems by optimal placement of FACTS devices using GA is presented in Sudersan et al. (2004) .

Recently, a relatively new, easy to implement, reasonably fast, and robust evolutionary algorithms (EAs) technique, known as differential evolution (DE) has been developed (Storn and Price, 1995 ; Price et al., 2005 ). DE has shown great promise in several applications including the field of power system ( Gamperle et al., 2002 ; Babu and Jehan, 2003 ; Ursem and Vadstrup, 2003 ; Onwubolu, 2004 ; Wong and Dong, 2005 ).
To the best of the author X  X  knowledge, the applications of the DE technique for optimal allocation of FACTS devices in general and UPFC in particular are not existed in the open literature.

In this paper, one of the newest EAs techniques, namely DE, is applied to find out the optimal location and parameter setting of
UPFC device for enhancing system security under single line contingencies through eliminating or minimizing the overloaded lines and the bus voltage limit violations. 2. Problem formulation 2.1. UPFC power flow model
Fig. 1 shows the equivalent circuit of a UPFC power flow model, this circuit consists of two coordinated synchronous voltage sources represent the UPFC adequately for the purpose of fundamental steady-state analysis ( Enrique et al., 2004 ), the UPFC voltage sources are:
E  X  V vR  X  cos d vR  X  j sin d vR  X  X  1  X 
E  X  V cR  X  cos d cR  X  j sin d cR  X  X  2  X  where V vR is the shunt voltage source magnitude; d vR is the shunt voltage source angle; V cR is the series voltage source magnitude; and d cR is the series voltage source angle.

The active power demanded by the series converter is drawn by the shunt converter from the AC network and supplied to bus m through the DC link. The output voltage of the series voltage source (series converter) is added to the nodal voltage, let say at bus k , to boost the nodal voltage at bus m . The voltage magnitude of the output voltage V cR provides voltage regulation, and the phase angle d cR determines the mode of power flow control. In addition to providing a supporting role in the active power exchange that takes place between the series converter and the AC system, the shunt converter may also generate or absorb reactive power in order to provide independent voltage magnitude regulation at its point of connection with the AC system.

Based on the equivalent circuit and on (1) and (2) the active and reactive power equations are: At bus k : P  X  V 2 k G kk  X  V k V m  X  G km cos  X  y k y m  X  X  B km sin  X  y Q At bus m : P  X  V 2 m G mm  X  V m V k  X  G mk cos  X  y m y k  X  X  B mk sin  X  y Q m  X  V 2 m B mm  X  V m V k  X  G mk sin  X  y m y k  X  B mk cos  X  y Series converter: P Q Shunt converter: P Q where P k and P m are the active powers at bus k and bus m . Q Q m are the reactive powers at bus k and bus m . V k and V m voltage magnitudes at bus k and bus m . y k and y m are the power angles at bus k and bus m . P cR and Q cR are the active and reactive power of UPFC series converter. P vR and Q vR are the active and reactive power of UPFC shunt converter. G kk and G mm are the conductance at bus k and bus m . G mk and G km are the conductance of the line between bus k and bus m . B kk and B mm are the susceptance at bus k and bus m . B mk and B km are the susceptance of the line between bus k and bus m . G vR and B vR are the conductance and the susceptance of the shunt voltage source of
The UPFC power flow equations, in linearized form, are combined with those of the AC network. 2.2. Contingency analysis procedure
A contingency is considered to be the outage of a generator, transformer or transmission line. The system may become unstable and enters an insecure state when a contingency event is occurred. Contingency analysis is one of the most important functions performed in power systems to establish appropriate preventive and/or corrective actions for each contingency. In this paper, we focus our attention only on the single line outage contingencies. For each line outage contingency in the system, we determine the all overloaded lines and the buses which have voltage limit violations, and then we rank the lines in the system according to the severity of the contingency. In other words, according to the number of the thermal and voltage limits violations the severities of contingencies are ranked, when the line outage contingency occurs. After determining the most critical contingency scenarios, DE technique is applied to find out the optimal location and parameter setting of UPFC. Installing
UPFC in the optimized location with the optimized parameter setting will eliminate or minimize the overloaded lines and the bus voltage limit violations under these critical contingencies according to the objective function described in next subsection. 2.3. Objective function
The main objective of this work is to determine the optimal parameter setting and location of the UPFC in the network for enhancing the system security level. This enhancement can be achieved through eliminating or minimizing overloaded lines and bus voltage limit violations under the most severe single line contingencies. Therefore, we considered the following technical objective function ( Radu and Besanger, 2005 ):
F  X  where S l and S l max represent the current apparent power in line l and the apparent power rate of line l , respectively; V m the voltage magnitude at bus m ; V mref represents the nominal voltage at bus m ; w l and w m represent two weights and are determined in order to have the same index value for 10% voltage difference and for 100% branch loading; q and r represent two coefficients used to penalize more or less overloads and voltage variations, respectively (for the presented study, they are considered to be equal to 2 ( Radu and Besanger, 2005 )); and ntl and nb represent the number of lines and the number of buses in the system.

The optimization is subject to: (a) Equality constraints: (b) Inequality constraints: 3. Differential evolution-based optimal location and parameter setting of UPFC 3.1. Overview of DE
Price (1995). Similar to other EAs techniques, DE is a heuristic, population-based optimization method that uses a population of points to search for a global minimum of a function over continuous search space. Basically, DE generates new vectors of parameters by adding the weighted difference between two population vectors to a third one. If the resulting individual provides a smaller objective function value than a predetermined population individual, in the next generation the new individual replaces the one with which it is compared; otherwise, the old individual is retained. There are several variants of DE ( Price, 1999; Onwubolu, 2004 ). The general notation of DE variants can be expressed as follows:
DE = x = y = z  X  22  X  where x denotes the mutated vector, y is the number of difference vectors and z is the crossover scheme. 3.2. DE-based optimal location and parameter setting of UPFC optimization variables: (a) The location of UPFC in the network is considered as the first (b) The series voltage source magnitude ( V cR ) of the UPFC is (c) The series voltage source phase angle ( d cR ) of the UPFC is (d) The shunt voltage source magnitude ( V vR )of the UPFC is considered as the fourth variable to be optimized, and the working range for this variable is [0.9, 1.1]. (e) The shunt voltage source phase angle ( d vR ) of the UPFC is considered as the fifth variable to be optimized, and the working range for this variable is [0, 2 p ].

These variables are optimized to enhance the security of power system under single line contingencies through eliminating or minimizing the line overloads and the bus voltage limit violations.
The step by step implementation of DE algorithm can be described as follows:
Step I: Initialize power flow data, and DE-related parameter such as the size of population ( NP ), the maximum number of iteration or generation ( G max ), the number of variables to be optimized ( D ), CR , and F .

Step II: Randomly generate the initial population of NP individuals in the feasible space by:
X
Considering the variables that should be optimized (i.e., the location and the parameter setting of UPFC) by satisfying the following conditions: The candidate locations are in the range [1, ntl ], ntl is the number of lines in the system (except the lines where the transformers are existed, we assumed that no UPFC will be installed in such lines).

Step III: Evaluate the fitness for each individual in the population according to the objective function in (11).
Step IV: Create a new population by: (1) Mutation: Randomly choose three different vectors from the (2) Crossover: for each X i ; G to get new vector u i,G .use: (3) Selection: for each X i ; G and corresponding u i,G to select vectors
Step V: Stop the process and print the best individual (optimal location and optimal parameter setting of UPFC) if the stopping criterion is satisfied, else go back to Step IV.
 4. Simulation results and discussion 4.1. Simulation tools and power systems
Matlab programming codes for DE, GA, PSO, and modified power flow algorithm to include UPFC are developed and incorporated together for the simulation purposes in this research. To investigate the validation and performance of the applied techniques, DE, GA, and PSO have been tested on the following two test systems: An IEEE 14-bus system and an IEEE 30-bus system. The data of the above-mentioned systems are taken from Freris and Sasson (1968) and Wu et al. (1998) , respectively. Simulations are performed on Pentium IV, 2.66 GHz, and 512 MB of RAM computer.
 4.2. Simulation results
DE, GA, and PSO techniques are implemented to find the optimal values of the above-mentioned variables. The adopted initial parameter values of DE, GA, and PSO are presented in
Table 1 . These values are adopted according to the values reported in the open literature, for DE ( Gamperle et al., 2002 ; Babu and Jehan, 2003 ; Wong and Dong, 2005 ), for GA ( Grefenstette, 1986 ;
DeJong and Spears, 1990 ; Goldberg and Deb, 1991 ; Goldberg et al., 1995), and for PSO ( Eberhart et al., 2001 ; Eberhart and Shi, 2002 ; Liu and He, 2005 ).

Since these techniques are probabilistic and stochastic search techniques, there are no standard values for their parameter and the adopted values were found to give the best performance in most cases as it is stated in the literature.

The evaluation of the applied DE, GA, and PSO techniques is performed with 100 trials for each technique, because these techniques are stochastic techniques and their simulation results should be evaluated statistically. The results obtained are presented as follows: 4.2.1. IEEE 14-bus test system
This system consists of five generators, 14 buses, 20 transmis-sion lines, and 11 loads. Contingency analysis and ranking process is performed on this system, there are 20 possible single line contingencies. For each single line outage contingency: Firstly, we determine the number of overloaded lines (NOLL) and the number of voltage limit violation buses (NVVB). Loading of the lines up to their thermal limits, 100% loading, is considered to be the threshold or the criterion for determining the overloaded lines, and the range [0.9 X 1.1] p.u. for bus voltage limits is considered to be the threshold or the criterion for determining the buses which have voltage limit violations. Secondly, we rank the tripped lines according to the severity of the contingency, in other words, according to the performance index PI=(NOLL+NVVB) as shown in Table 2 . PI is zero for the remaining lines.
 on this system, we can see that there are 15 lines which are the severest contingency scenarios in this system as shown in Table 2 .
In the case of one of these lines is tripped, the most overloaded lines and bus voltage limit violations will be encountered. There-fore, to investigate the effectiveness of optimal installation of UPFC on the system under such cases, DE, GA, and PSO techniques are applied to find out the optimal location and parameter setting of
UPFC which eliminate or minimize the overloaded lines and bus voltage limit violations under such scenarios.
 voltage limit violations before and after using UPFC in the optimized locations obtained by applying DE, GA, and PSO techniques after 100 trials for each technique are shown in Table 3 .

From Table 3 , we can find that the impact of 10 single line contingency scenarios on this system can be completely elimi-nated by using UPFC in the optimized locations with the optimized parameter setting obtained by the applied techniques.
For the rest 5 single line contingency scenarios, although with the help of using UPFC in the optimized locations with the optimized parameter setting did not result in eliminating all of the overloaded lines in these cases, most of overloaded lines are eliminated and the power flow distributions in the rest are significantly reduced. Also, all bus voltage limit violations are eliminated; these results are achieved by DE, GA, and PSO.
Table 4 shows the optimal locations and optimal parameter setting of UPFC obtained by applying DE, GA, and PSO techniques (after 100 trials).

When line 1 is outage, which is the severest contingency scenario in this system, the largest number of overloaded lines and bus voltage limit violations is encounter. Fig. 2 shows the power flow distribution in the IEEE 14-bus system obtained by DE, GA, and PSO (after 100 trials for each technique). Before using UPFC in this system, there are 5 overloaded lines, and after using
UPFC in the optimized location obtained by DE, GA, and PSO, two of them are eliminated and the power flow distributions in the rest of the overloaded lines are significantly reduced. We only choose this case as a sample of the results we have obtained, because this is the severest contingency scenario and also because of the limited space of this paper.
 Fig. 3 shows voltage distribution for IEEE 14-bus system with UPFC installed in the optimized location with the optimized parameter setting obtained by DE, GA, and PSO techniques (after 100 trials) when line 1 is outage. Before using UPFC in this system, there are 7 buses that have voltage limit violations, and after using UPFC all of them are eliminated.

Fig.4 shows the convergence characteristics of the objective function by DE, GA, and PSO techniques (after 100 trials) when line 1 is outage.

Table 5 shows the worst, the average, and the best values of the objective function in this system using UPFC in the optimized location obtained by DE, GA, and PSO after 100 trails for different initial parameter values of these techniques. 4.2.2. IEEE 30-bus test system
This system consists of six generators, 30 buses, 41 transmis-sion lines, and 21 loads. Contingency analysis and ranking process is also performed on this system as mentioned in IEEE 14-bus system. There are 41 possible single line contingencies in this system. However, taking into account that there are three lines (9 X 11, 12 X 13, 25 X 26) connected to isolated buses (buses connected to only one line), in this paper only 38 single line contingencies are considered. The severest single line contingency scenarios are determined and the tripped lines are ranked according to the performance index, PI=(NOLL+NVVB) as shown in Table 6 . PI is zero for the remaining lines.

From Table 6 , we can see that there are 23 lines which are the severest contingency scenarios in this system. In the case of one of these lines is tripped, the most overloaded lines and bus voltage limit violations will be encountered. With the presence of UPFC in the system, DE, GA, and PSO techniques are applied to find out its optimal location and parameter setting which eliminate or minimize the overloaded lines and bus voltage limit violations under such scenarios.

Table 7 shows the overloaded lines with their overloading percentage and bus voltage limit violations before and after using UPFC in the optimized locations obtained by applying DE, GA, and PSO techniques after 100 trials for each technique.

From Table 7 , we can observe that the impact of 18 single line contingency scenarios on this system can be completely elimi-nated by using UPFC in the optimized locations with the optimized parameter setting obtained by the applied techniques. For the rest 5 single line contingency scenarios, although with the help of using UPFC in the optimized locations with the optimized parameter setting did not result in eliminating of all overloaded lines in these cases, most of overloaded lines are eliminated and the power flow distributions in the rest are significantly reduced. Also, all bus voltage limit violations are eliminated; these results are achieved by DE, GA, and PSO.

The optimal locations and optimal parameter setting of UPFC obtained by applying DE, GA, and PSO techniques (after 100 trials) are shown in Table 8 .
 Power flow distribution in the IEEE 30-bus system obtained by DE, GA, and PSO (after 100 trials for each technique) is shown in Fig. 5 when line 1 is outage which is the severest contingency scenario in this system. Before using UPFC in this system, there are 9 overloaded lines, and after using UPFC in the optimized location obtained by DE, 6 of them are eliminated and the power flow distributions in the rest overloaded lines are significantly reduced. While after using UPFC in the optimized location obtained by GA and PSO, 5 of the overloaded lines are eliminated and the power flow distributions in the rest overloaded line are significantly reduced. We only choose this case as a sample of the results we have obtained, because this is the severest contingency scenario and also because of the limited space of this paper.
 Fig. 6 shows voltage distribution for IEEE 30-bus system with UPFC installed in the optimized location with the optimized parameter setting obtained by DE, GA, and PSO techniques (after 100 trials) when line 1 is outage. Before using UPFC in this system, there are 10 buses that have voltage limit violations, and after using UPFC all of them are eliminated.

Fig. 7 shows the convergence characteristics of the objective function by DE, GA, and PSO techniques (after 100 trials) when line 1 is outage.

Table 9 shows the worst, the average, and the best values of the objective function in this system using UPFC in the optimized location obtained by DE, GA, and PSO after 100 trails for different initial parameter values of these techniques. The results indicate that: For PSO technique, the best value for c 1 and c 2 is 1.5. For DE technique, the best value for F is 0.5 and for CR is 0.5.
For GA technique, the best value of the crossover probability is 0.6 and for mutation probability is 0.04.
 processes the optimization faster than GA for the reasons that GA processes the optimization by selection, crossover and mutation operations while PSO does not involve such operations. 4.3. Comparisons between the performance of DE, GA and PSO techniques

One of the newest computational intelligence techniques, namely: DE has been successfully applied to the problem under consideration. Max-imization of power system security is considered as the optimization criterion. The performance of DE is compared with that of GA and PSO.

IEEE 14-bus system and an IEEE 30-bus system. The obtained results show that DE technique has superior features including high-quality solution, stable convergence characteristic, and good computation efficiency.
