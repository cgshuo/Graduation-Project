 David E. Losada  X  Juan M. Fern  X  andez-Luna 1. Introduction This special issue contains the extended versions of six among the best papers presented at the 27th European Conference on Information Retrieval Research (ECIR 2005). This conference was initially established by the Information Retrieval Specialist Group of the British Computer Society (BCS-IRSG) under the name  X  X nnual Colloquium on Information Retrieval Research. X  The colloquium was held in the United Kingdom each year until 1998, when the event was organised in Grenoble, France. Since then the conference venue has alternated between the United Kingdom and Continental Europe, reflecting the growing European orientation of ECIR. For the same reason, in 2001 the event was renamed  X  X uropean Conference on Information Retrieval Research. X  In recent years, ECIR has continued to grow and has become the major European forum for the discussion of research in the field of Information Retrieval. Since 2002, the proceedings of this conference are being published by Springer Verlag in their Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

ECIR 2005, celebrated in Santiago de Compostela (Spain) on 21 X 23 March 2005, was jointly organized by the University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain) and the University of Granada (Spain), under the auspices of the Information Retrieval Specialist Group of the British Computer Society. The conference was co-chaired by David E. Losada (University of Santiago de Compostela) and Juan M. Fern  X  andez-Luna (University of Granada) and the conference venue was the Technical School of Engineering of the University of Santiago de Compostela. In terms of submissions, ECIR 2005 was a record-breaking success, since 124 full papers were submitted in response to the call for papers. This is the highest number of submissions received in the ECIR series. Paper submissions were received from across
Europe and further afield including North America, South America, Asia and Australia, which is a clear indication of the growing popularity and reputation of the conference. Out of the 124 submitted papers, 34 (27%) were accepted for presentation in the conference. Again, this was the record-low acceptance rate, which ensured a high qualitative standard. The papers presented at the conference covered a wide range of topics including both theoretical and experimental work in several IR tasks (summarization, classification, fusion, retrieval, etc.) and in different media (text, images, video, hypertext, structured text, etc.). Papers proposed research efforts either in centralized or distributed environments and dealing with efficiency or effectiveness issues.
 This special issue brings together the extended versions of six among the best papers of ECIR 2005. We invited the authors of the papers considered the best by the ECIR 2005
Programme Committee to submit research papers with significant amplification and exten-sion of the original ECIR work. Each paper was reviewed by at least two reviewers, which assessed the overall quality of the work and the degree to which this was indeed an extended version of the original ECIR 2005 paper. Six papers were finally selected to be included in this special issue. The six papers range on a variety of topics, as explained in the next section. 2. Papers in this issue The paper  X  X oun Phrases in Interactive Query Expansion and Document Ranking, X  by Olga
Vechtomova (University of Waterloo, Canada) presents several techniques for selecting noun phrases for interactive query expansion. To this aim, the work uses pseudo-relevance feed-back and novel phrase-based document ranking methods. Phrases are selected for query expansion combining syntactic and statistical techniques. A number of experiments to study the effectiveness of noun phrases in document ranking are reported. The results demonstrate that the overall improvements from using phrases are moderate but some improvements in average precision are obtained at top ranks.
 Raija Lehtokangas, Heikki Keskustalo and Kalervo J  X  arvelin (University of Tampere, Finland) present the paper  X  X ighly Relevant Documents Lost in CLIR: Experiments with
Dictionary Translation and Pseudo-Relevance Feedback X  in which dictionary-based cross-language information retrieval using graded relevance assessments is investigated in a best match retrieval environment. Evaluation results are reported involving monolingual baseline queries and translated queries. Pseudo-relevance feedback was used to expand the original queries and the experiments pay special attention to the effect on performance when different relevance grades are adopted.
 The paper  X  X an constrained relevance feedback and display strategies help users retrieve items on mobile devices? X  by Vishwa Vinay, Ingemar J. Cox (University College London,
UK), Natasa Milic-Frayling and Ken Wood (Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK) inves-tigates relevance feedback on mobile devices. The small screens and limited user actions typically performed in these devices motivated the authors to design novel methods that construct a user decision tree representing all possible outcomes of the user interaction with the system. By examining the tree they compute an upper limit on relevance feedback perfor-mance. Three standard feedback algorithms are evaluated in conjunction with two strategies for presenting retrieval results. A user study comparing the performance of the feedback methods with real users was also conducted.
 The paper  X  X ser study on ontology as a query construction tool, X  by Sari Suomela and Jaana Kek  X  al  X  ainen (University of Tampere, Finland) examines the use of an ontology as a search tool. Different users were asked to create queries using a concept-based information retrieval interface and a regular information retrieval interface. The effectiveness of these searches was analyzed as well as the number of search concepts, keywords and their overlap. The difficulty of locating the desired concepts in the ontology and the expansion features of the concept-based interface were also the object of study.

The paper  X  X ontent-based federated search of text-based digital libraries in Peer-to-Peer networks, X  by Jie Lu and Jamie Callan (Carnegie Mellon University, USA) addresses the problem of enhancing peer-to-peer networks with support for content-based searches. The paper investigates the problems of resource representation, resource selection and result merging for federated search of text-based digital libraries in hierarchical peer-to-peer net-works. They adapt existing approaches to content-based federated search and develop novel methods for resource representation, resource selection and result merging according to the unique characteristics of these networks. The experimentation performed reveals that the approach proposed offer a good combination of accuracy and efficiency.

The paper  X  X SP and Cluster-based Solutions to the Reassignment of Document Identi-fiers, X  by Roi Blanco and Alvaro Barreiro (University of A Coru  X  na, Spain) investigates how to reduce inverted files size by reassigning document identifiers. The paper views this prob-lem as a traveling salesman problem (TSP) and reduces the input data dimensionality using a support vector machine transformation. Some efficient solutions based on clustering are also presented. Moreover, the TSP and clustering strategies are combined for reordering the document identifiers. Experimental runs and analysis of the resulting compression ratios are reported showing the potential of these compression techniques. 3.
