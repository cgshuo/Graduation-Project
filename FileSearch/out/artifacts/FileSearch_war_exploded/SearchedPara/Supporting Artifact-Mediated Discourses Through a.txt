 This paper focuses on tight communities and specifically on the distributed, mediated discourses that their members ar-ticulate around documents and inscribed material artifacts. The paper presents a prototype-based design experience to-ward the definition of a collaborative annotation tool that is endowed with discourse oriented functionalities whose main characteristics have emerged from case studies we undertook in the healthcare and agricultural domains. In latter domain an initial prototype was proposed and progressively tuned to help users propose modifications to an institutional doc-ument through the expression of comments gathered around and about a common artifact, and then build a representa-tive summary of the opinions emerging within the commu-nity as a result of this distributed discussion. In light of the reported case study, we discuss a new perspective on this class of annotating applications and the related functional-ities that could realize a new simplified model of discourse and foster its adoption in distributed settings and commu-nities of practice.
 H.5.3 [ Group and Organization ]: Computer-supported cooperative work Design, Human Factors Annotation Systems
One of the main contributions of CSCW to the HCI field has been to have recognized and comprehensively studied the central role of artifacts-in-use in human collaboration. A number of studies (e.g., [1, 26, 3, 24]) have shed light on the multiple ways artifacts mediate interaction and support cooperation in terms of both activity articulation, awareness promotion and knowledge sharing in specific settings. When such a mediation occurs throug h paper based artifacts, it is common to observe that actors exploit various kinds of an-notations to enrich their documents with additional, often informal and highly situated information (e.g. [11, 30, 14]) that can serve all of the purposes mentioned above, as well as be easily related to the irreducible need for users to appro-priate the available means for ad-hoc and even unanticipated purposes [2, 29, 4].

Nowadays powerful and relatively cheap devices are avail-able that are endowed with multimedia, touch-sensitive in-terfaces; this could facilitate the digitization of coordinative artifacts that closely mimic the affordances and flexibility that traditional artifacts exhibit when they are used in coop-erative settings. Then it is natural to think of a digital and sound counterpart of paper based annotations that could exploit the increasing versatility and flexibility that char-acterize some commercial apps for handheld devices (e.g., iAnnotate PDF, GoodNotes for iPad, DioMemo and Han-drite for Android Tablets).

When cooperation occurs in a distributed setting, the initial, almost stigmergic, coordinative purposes of annota-tions [10] are increasingly complemented by their use as a support of indirect discourse by the actors that access shared artifacts and annotate them [13]. In other words, the coordi-native, reflective and communicative roles of annotations in artifacts-in-use become increasingly intertwined and there-fore call for a unified and coherent support.

When technology is called to support discourse an imme-diate question arises: to which degree should the technology impose a sort of model or structure to situated communica-tion? This issue is as old (and controversial) as the Coordi-nator [31], g-IBIS [12] and all the technologies these inspired to some extent and of which it would be difficult (if not plethoric) to give an exhaustive account here. We believe that answering this question cannot happen in a vacuum or by adopting any pondered reflection over the nature of discourse in general terms and from contrasting standpoints (e.g. Searle and Habermas) [27].

Rather, our point is that addressing how to support dis-course, and therefore the continuous emergence and recon-ciliation of multiple interpretations of shared contents, has to be situated in the context of the setting where specific discourses take place and unfold. In this light, we can dis-tinguish between situations where cooperating actors gather in loose communities: in this case, the links between com-munity members are weak, since members can come to inter-act for the first time or because their previous interactions did not build a recognizable common background [19]; and situations where actors constitute a tight community, whose members are mutually acquainted with each other since they either share previous experiences or rely on sufficiently un-derstood and agreed-upon notions and conventions [8].
It is reasonable to believe that a loose community is likely to need a support that proposes some sort of ordered discus-sions so that the process does not diverge in an unproductive way: this situation is referred to, e.g., in terms of  X  X arge-scale argumentation X  in [18] and in terms of  X  X ontested collective intelligence X  in [13]. In both cases the proposed technol-ogy offers predefined categories to structure discourse with different degrees of prescriptiveness.

Conversely, a tight community would benefit from a sup-port that exploits the (mainly social) mechanisms the com-munity naturally adopts to make discussion among its mem-bers productive. These mechanisms tap into the conventions and mutual understanding the community has developed in its evolution. The present paper focuses on tight communi-ties and, as anticipated, on their discourses situated around inscribed material artifacts (typically documents). This sce-nario covers a set of situations that make the conception of a specific support both interesting and challenging at the same time.

Examples of documents around which discourses (e.g., to discuss the contents, propose amendments, judge their quality, take some decision, reconcile diverging interpreta-tions) can unfold encompass: sets of policies to be checked against coherence and applicability; new business processes or medical protocols; sets of guidelines aimed at guarantee-ing high quality of outcome and efficiency; project proposals and project drafts; also drafts of scientific papers, and so on. It is evident that these situations and the related artifacts that are made object of discussion differ from each other; nevertheless they also share common features if we assume that those artifacts tend to be the stratified and agreed upon expression of a quite tight community: e.g., common back-ground, common goals and above all common practices to get access and relate to the shared artifact.

In the past year, we have been involved in two research projects with the aim to support collaboration between the stakeholders involved: in the first project these were agricul-tural growers belonging to a regional association that were supposed to exchange experiences and knowledge and to ar-ticulate tasks to, among other aims, make technical policies coherent with their practice a nd their practices compliant with those technical policies. In the second project, the actors involved were doctors and patients involved in a dis-tributed care program. Although different with respect to many aspects, in both cases annotating shared artifacts was one of the relevant practices we observed. The first outcomes of our investigation in the healthcare domain are being re-ported in [4]. In this paper we briefly report those findings that from this latter investigation regard annotations; and we will present and discuss the findings elicited from the field study in the agricultural domain in some more details since these led to the development of a prototype that fulfills the requirements extracted from both settings.

From these two empirical researches, we then derived a set of indications that we outline in the next section; in light of these requirements we are currently developing an an-notation tool called RAT (Recursive Annotation Tool) that serves as sand-box for testing the feasibility of functionalities to be proposed, and possibly engineered, in future projects
The common element observed in both the field studies mentioned above was that the texts 2 that were made object of annotation and discussion were not to change during the process of their progressive annotation. Even when the fi-nal goal of the discussion was the improvement and related modification of the documents X  content, as in the agricul-tural case, this activity was framed within an ordered prac-tice where at some time the content is  X  X ocked X  (or  X  X reezed X ) to allow actors to discuss it. This behavior actually recurs in many cases: more than an aspect that is pursued be-cause it can simplify the technology of annotation involved (since this can also do without serious functionalities of ver-sion control), this is rather a natural condition to allow for distributed and asynchronous discussion, and any situation where the  X  X round cannot be cut from under the partici-pants X  feet X  (to borrow an expression used by an intervie-wee). This practice can be decomposed in a set of steps like the following ones: a first step where the discussion is car-ried on, almost unmoderated, and the annotations are cre-ated by the community around and about a common object; then a second step where the committed/appointed people are supposed to order and make sense of the annotations produced that far; and then a third step, where changes that derive from the annotated standpoints are selected, ap-proved and finally executed. Possibly this simplified and very lightweight workflow is repeated to further refine the content at each iteration, until a satisfactory formulation has been reached: this collaborative process is reminiscent of the so called  X  X ulsar X  model, proposed by Holt years ago [16].
To support this specific collaborative process, researchers would be called to address a twofold aim: first, to define a collaborative annotation system that suitably supports collective discourse and collaborative sense-making; second, how to support the activity of building a meaningful and representative summary of the collected opinions and that possibly facilitates the modification of the document con-tent. This research agenda shares most of the requirements identifiedin[13]andinthisveinwetriedtointerpretthe requirements collected from the two field studies at hand.
In the next two sections we will present the main points elicited in the distributed healthcare case and we will de-scribe the context of the project in the agricultural domain. In this latter domain an initial solution was developed and experimented with selected key users. Both experiences trig-gered the conception of a set of more sophisticated discourse oriented functionalities that we will outline in Section 3 when describing a new tool addressing the indications drawn from the field. The concluding remarks reported in Section 5 will position the proposed annotation tool into a more com-

During our interactions with practitioners in the health-care domain we proposed them the idea of providing pa-tients and caregivers with a flexible and general-purpose tool by which to annotate the texts they exchange during the care process, e.g., reports, prescriptions, schedules, emails with requests for clarifications and the like. This idea was grounded on their needs that emerged from the discussion and that were increasingly engrossed by the tenets of the so called  X  X arrative medicine X  [9]. According to this approach, the relationship between a patient and her doctor is not the one between comrades that  X  X ight the battle against dis-ease X  [21]; it is rather the one coming out of a process of progressive mutual understanding, viewpoints sharing and personal relationship development between patient and doc-tor toward the recovery and well-being of the former.
This mutual understanding is aimed at, on the one hand, making a health problem explicit as this is perceived and expressed by a patient in her own idiosyncratic terms; and, on the other hand, at understanding what should be done that fits the socio-psico-physical characteristics of the pa-tient to solve her problem and have her fine again. As such, the interviewees claimed that the structured and positivist way of describing illnesses and patients, e.g., in the struc-tured charts and forms of an ele ctronic medical record, could straightjacket and curb their hermeneutic and situated task of understanding the patient X  X  complaints and, the other way round, of making their indications be appropriated by the patient and followed actually.

Thus, a tool by which to annotate the flow of electronic messages and their attachments that we were told are usu-ally exchanged between doctors and their patients after the first visit was recognized being of great value: it would help a doctor extract,  X  X solate X , relevant data from the textual ac-counts a patient makes of her condition while, in doing so, preserving the original context where these data make sense to both; and, on the other hand, such a tool would enable mutual commenting: doctors would comment passages of their patients X  accounts; patients, in their turn, would com-ment passages from their doctors X  reports and prescriptions, as a way to facilitate sense making and clarification.
Thus, the availability of an annotation functionality of electronic patients X  accounts and doctors X  reports, both in terms of semantic tagging and free-text commenting, was envisioned as a way to unleash the full potential of the unstructured content of these documents and to reach a grounded understanding between the actors involved beyond the unavoidable rigidities and constraints of any  X  X niversal X  or standard model of illness and medical intervention that would be imposed upon their interactions.
Atthesametimeoftheseencountersinthehealthcare domain, we have also been involved in a project, called Misura124, whose aim was the design of technological so-lutions for a heterogeneous community of fruit and veg-etables producers that recognized themselves under a so called GOA, or Growers Organizations Association. In this project, one of the tasks that was very soon recognized as most valuable to support was the management of comments and proposals of amendment that were expressed by produc-tion experts regarding the so called Technical Policies (TP). These are official documents that are issued by either a Re-gional authority or an institutional body to regulate various aspects of agricultural practice for a given kind of produce of the land. TP documents are issued every year to include the best practices gathered so far from the territory and present clear indications that mandatorily specify how crops must be treated in the next campaign. For their nature, the draft-ing of TPs requires the tight collaboration of heterogeneous professionals and experts from organizations of growers to pre-validate and, in some cases, ameliorate these indications before their official issuing.

The Regional authorities collect the feedback from the qualified organizations to which these experts belong since it is acknowledged that professionals at the grassroots level own a very valuable practical knowledge about the effects of the strict application of the guidelines on the quality of the produced fruits and vegetable. The process of discussing the guidelines reported in a TP, detecting areas of improve-ment and amendment and reaching a consensus about those proposals of change to submit to the Regional authority in-volves a scattered community of experts as well as people that work for a GOA within a smaller area, in our project the Lombardy Region. Regional rules state that the annual TP document that is issued by each region can be amended by the GOA operating in this region. This rule in turn implies that the GOA is supposed to collect proposals for amendment from all the affiliated growers. This task has been told us to be a very difficult and time consuming ac-tivity. Indeed, each grower assigns an agricultural consultant (AC) to propose the amendments: these consultants are the experts that are usually called to help growers in applying the best practices reported in the TPs; moreover a GOA X  X  employee acts as coordinator : she receives all the propos-als for amendment and is responsible for editing the final amendment lists that must be sent back to the pertinent regional authority. The amendment collection is a complex negotiation process due to two main factors: a) a limited set of amendments can be sent back to the regional author-ity, otherwise they are not really considered; b) amendments may conflict, and often do, with each other.

In our observational study we saw that this task was car-ried out in a fragmented way that can be outlined as follows: 1) the coordinator sends the TPs to each AC by email, with a spreadsheet in attachment to collect the amendment propos-als; 2) each AC collects her own amendments and sends the edited spreadsheet back to the coordinator; 3) then the co-ordinator produces a unified spreadsheet of the amendments and identifies the most important and controversial points from this exchange of multiple emails; 4) the coordinator and the ACs meet all together to reach consensus on the vari-ous standpoints, prioritize the elements to amend and define the final list: this usually happens three/four times before they all come up with a final version of the amendment list. Step 3 is the most frustrating for the coordinator because usually not all the ACs send their spreadsheet on time, and she has to solicit them by email several times; in addition, sometimes ACs do not fill in the spreadsheet as they are supposed to. Thus making order out of the magmatic mate-rial collected that far was perceived (and probably was) an awkward task.

In order to address the shortcomings of the current TP the document (highlighted) are displayed. amendment process, we deployed a prototypical service, the  X  X echnical Policy Service X  (TPS). In so doing, we immedi-ately realized that the consolidated practices regarding the process of TP amendment led to a flat resistance to the new support, although all ACs complained about the old process. Moreover, since readiness to adopt and use ICT proficiently was generally low, many ACs expressed concerns about the introduction of  X  X  too complex tool X .

Then, we decided to split the digitization process in two steps. First, we proposed a basic online service that was aimed at overcoming the above mentioned fragmentation by offering a unique place where the technical policy documents could be shared among the ACs and the coordinator, and where amendments can be attached close to the pertinent text in terms of textual annotations (the list of amendments on the right in Figure 1). Amendments were added by high-lighting a part of the document (the text in gray on the left in Figure 1) and by filling in a new amendment form that is displayed in a separated panel of the graphical interface when the user clicks on the Annotate button. Second, we planned to deal with richer functionalities more focused on discourse and negotiation once the ACs had become more accustomed to the interaction practices induced by this new virtual  X  X lace X .

Moreover, the TPS was intended to be part of a more comprehensive platform supporting various kinds of interac-tions among the GOA X  X  members and their staff. For this reason, the ACs and the coordinator were invited to use a standard Forum to exchange opinions on the contents of TPs at hand and on how to amend them. This opportu-nity notwithstanding, interacting with the coordinator and some of the ACs during the development and adjusting of the TP service made us understand that there were some essential discourse elements that users wanted to be directly connected with the annotations. To this aim, we made some specific controls available in the annotation area according to the user profile (see the rightmost side of the annota-tion header in Figure 1). By clicking on the  X  X heets X  icon within an existing amendment, both the ACs and the co-ordinator were then endowed with the capability to add a further amendment referring to the same target within the TP. This sort of shortcut to the creation of alternative amendments to the same point in the TP was aimed at a twofold aim: first, to oppose an amendment through the constructive proposal of an alternative way to amend the same passage; second, to promote awareness of an existing correlation between multiple amendments so as to facilitate their interpretation, post-hoc analysis and, hence, collabo-rative discussion. Conversely, by clicking on the  X  X humb-up X  icon, both the ACs and the coordinator could express their support or approval to an existing amendment, without the need to add any other and redundant annotation confirm-ing the points stated therein. Moreover, users could delete their own amendments by means of the  X  X rash X  icon, un-less these had already been  X  X oted for X  by some other user. This regarded the tacit convention that  X  X ot yet approved comments X  were to be considered as provisional both for their authors and for the other ACs. This constraint was not purposely implemented for the coordinator, who could delete any amendment irrespectively of their approval state: this addressed the tacit convention by which only the coor-dinator could  X  X rune X  the TP of amendments, as it usually happened as a result of a discussion (either in the forum or face-to-face) that had led to an agreement in this sense. In addition, one more control was meant for the coordinator only, to support the other typical way she contributed to the discussion. She could see all the annotations endowed with an additional  X  X ick X  icon (see Figure 2), by which an amend-ment would be officially approved and taken for considera-tion for the final draft: this formal approval would prevent the annotation be deleted or modified even by its author as, in some way, it implies a sort of  X  X romotion X  to the status of representative amendment of the community, which should be not disputed any more as some consensus has been al-ready reached. Also in this case, making this information Figure 2: Two examples of annotations and the co-ordinator controls (top right). available was considered helpful to move the discussion on and begin tackling more controversial points.

The TPS was then a first tool that we put in the users X  hands to alleviate the drawbacks we observed in the practice of TP amending. From its initial use we saw that annotat-ing and simultaneously sharing annotations allowed all users involved to get a fast picture of what was  X  X ot X  at any given time, i.e., what was argued and debated, and not to overlap in their contributions. In doing so, the actual negotiation process could start earlier and be kept more focused than it was to be because all the contributors had all the necessary information  X  X eady to hand X .

Making amendments available online and close to the TP that was under discussion was perceived as a clear advantage that allowed the stakeholders involved to reduce the need to organize time-consuming and expensive colocated meetings to only those where to discuss the most important and del-icate issues that were deemed impossible to resolve in an asynchronous and distributed manner. On the other hand, the semantic information that the iconic controls allowed users to attach to their annotations enabled additional ca-pabilities aimed at supporting the coordinator in the fourth and perhaps more chaotic step of the drafting process, when amendments had to be selected and consolidated. Informa-tion available about how many people  X  X oted for X  an amend-ment, on how many amendments were created for the same targets, and the like allowed the coordinator to export a pri-oritized list of amendments as a spreadsheet that she could process according to internal conventions and Regional poli-cies and then send back to the Regional authority. Here again, a tacit convention allows the coordinator to have the final word on all the controversies that may have outlived the related debates, as it usually happens when the deadline imposed by the regional authority approaches: the coordi-nator (as representative of the GOA) is the only interface of the interactions with the Regional authority and she has to respond to any possible clarification request. However, the coordinator uses this power sparingly: amending TPs is only one of the many occasions in which the GOA representative is called to collaborate with the ACs and keeping mutual trust is the basis of this sometimes complex interaction.
The timing of the project did not allow a systematic val-idation of the TPS described above. However, during the meetings we organized to review the functionalities and to train the ACs  X  X n the job X  by simulating full drafting cycles on existing TPs, end-users showed a progressively clearer ap-preciation for having a virtual  X  X lace X  where to share amend-ments; on the other hand, they were not fully persuaded that the overall platform could  X  X ctually X  support the related dis-cussions and therefore reduce the number and nature of their face-to-face meetings. They blamed the fact that the Forum was not completely integrated with the annotation service: thus we started a set of brief talks with the coordinator and some of the ACs that expressed their willingness to help us further refine our service along the  X  X iscourse X  dimension of their cooperative task. In these talks, we realized that adding new functionalities to this aim had to be done care-fully: the risk at stake is to unduly increase the complexity of the tool to adopt and, first and foremost, to break those tacit conventions that permeate their long run experience of interaction, e.g., by imposing a model of discussion that could be perceived as artificial or unrealistic: even the very simple discourse model introduced by the TPS was disre-garded by some ACs.
The case of the Technical Policy and the feedback that we received from the users of the TPS prototype show a point that is central in our proposal. We saw ACs and the coordi-nator propose amendments and discuss them with both tex-tual annotations (i.e., side notes, comments) and semantic ones: these latter were de facto associated with the  X  X humb-up X  icon to back up an amendment, and with the  X  X heets X  icon that was used to propose a better alternative. But we also saw users discuss about these judgments in subse-quent and correlated comments; likewise, users told us they would appreciate to  X  X ote for a vote X  or explicitly contest an amendment with a thumb-down icon, and the like. In short, comments and tags would be used almost interchangeably.
This sheds light on the shortcoming that is inherent in any tool by which users can annotate a content (e.g., [20]): the structured model of discourse that they adopt and enact to make order out of chaotic annotations. These models usu-ally disregard the fact that natural language is inherently recursive and hence distinguish (at least) between target documents and annotations. On the contrary, we observed practices of  X  X nnotation annotating X  that could call for a differentperspective(seeFigure3),whereanytextcanbe object of an annotation and this, in its turn, can be made the target of some other text. Moreover in many cases these models also propose a more or less prescriptive ontology to characterize annotations and their targets to make them ma-chine processable. Yet, users are often wary of these ontolo-gies since annotations are heavily context dependent, both in respect to the community of users that share them and to the contingent situation where they make some sense to the users.

These considerations led to the development of RAT, i.e., a Recursive Annotating Tool by which users can add an informal layer with respect to  X  X ontent X , and yet be able to discuss and characterize it as it were just but content, since it also is strictly situated, contextualized and bounded to the discourses that users make around and about an electronic resource. The main goal of this tool is to address those advanced requirements like reply-threading and bottom-up taxonomy development that have difficulty in breaking forth the prototypes that have been proposed so far only within the Academia (such as Annotea, MADCOW, Debora) and  X  X re difficult to communicate to users and even more difficult to integrate into an easy-to-use tool interface X  [15].
In RAT, an annotation is just a text that is anchored to another text and is given to the interpretation of either Figure 3: A new perspective on digital annotation. users, machines or both level. Moreover, targets can be nested within each other: for instance, a document can be made target of (one or more) annotations, as well as any of its parts. In doing so, an annotation can  X  X tand for X  an N-ary relation between targets (see the tag  X  X edundant X  in Figure 4).

In this view the aspect of annotations of being a content is important and it intentionally overrides any strong (i.e., on-tological) distinction between textual annotations, i.e., com-ments by which humans discuss over some content; and se-mantic annotations, i.e., tags and labels that are attached to content to enable some sort of machine interoperability. This intentionally flat model leaves room for customization in terms of a particular  X  X se X  of the semantic tags the tool allows to attach to electronic resources as it does not rely on any predefined domain model to either adopt at or adapt to a particular setting.

Only once annotations have been created, and bound to each other in a flat web of references (see Figure 4) with relationships that are semantically  X  X eutral X  (i.e., void of any predefined meaning), they can either be associated to specific application behaviors, or left to the interpretation of human actors that attach them to their documents and share them to communicate 3 .

The purposely flat model of RAT and its high configura-bility make it (at least in principle) a system that is able to emulate (in conjuction with specific application companions that would tap in its semantic tags) the functionalities of any other domain-specific or task-oriented annotation plat-form, like g-IBIS, Cohere, C ACHE, Collaboratorium and Debategraph (see in [13]). This is because RAT differs from any tool that allows (either explicitly or surreptitiously) to instantiate and apply formal ontologies on content and con-versations: rather, its aim is to allow users to made their intended meanings more explicit and shared; this, in turn, can facilitate human users in understanding each other or enable the automatic filtering, ordering and rearrangement of annotations so as to enable discussion, sense making and consensus building, on the one hand; and spur argumenta-tion, the reconciliation of po tential misunde rstandings and the emergence of minority standpoints, on the other hand.
The reader could notice that also hyperlinks challenge a too strict distinction between textual and semantic annotations: indeed hyperlinks can be written by actors on-the-go in an ad-hoc manner to refer their interlocutors to an external resource. But yet they are also associated to a specific ap-plication behavior, like launching a browser instance to get access to a Web resource or trying to dispatch a message to a receiver in case of mailto URIs.
RAT is mainly aimed at supporting two human behaviors: first, RAT enables the progressive nesting and intertwin-ing of human  X  X iscourses within discourses X , that is, coping with the intrinsically magmatic and multi-topic nature of human conversations and allowing their unfolding in terms of threads. See for instance in Figure 4 the comment Z is intended as a reply to what said in comment Y (a se-mantic annotation clarifies that) and this, in its turn, is a reply to comment X. Yet, comment Y is also intended to ad-dress a circumscribed passage in comment X (highlighted in Figure 4), with comment Z and K, which challenges a vote against X, intended to be connected in a single thread of dis-cussion. In short, comments X, Y and K can be seen as one single discussion about the same passage in the document, where comments Z is also applied to another passage.
Second, RAT supports the bottom-up specification and clarification of concepts, and the creation of links. Semantic annotations can be attached for the sake of (self-)clarity, to ask for and propose further specifications as well as to al-low the system to re-arrange comments and their annotated portions so that single topics, standpoints and points could be presented more orderly and discussed in a more efficient way (cf. phase four of the TP amending process). Possible semantic tags can be, e.g.,  X  X his is a summarization X ,  X  X his is a reformulation X ,  X  X his is against X ,  X  X his is in favour X , if these labels are found to support users X  needs to  X  X ypify X  content. For example, users can use semantic annotations to attach concepts to (any) content that either specialize or generalize each others (e.g., the label  X  X eeds X  and  X  X lants X  in Figure 4). Potential ambiguities or contradictions between mutually referring nodes would not be considered breaches in the ontological model (which is not provided at all) but rather opportunities to discuss shortcomings in human ut-terance and to resolve or suspend them for the task X  X  aims.
The model-flatness of RAT is reflected also in terms of a simplified interaction with it. To this aim, the RAT interface offers just a small floating circular switch that user can set in only one of three possible states: namely  X  X ff X ,  X  X arget mode X  and  X  X nnotation mode X . Thus, the typical use case unfolds as follows: 1. The user activates the  X  X arget mode X ; if the switch is respectively) can enrich each other. 2. the user activates the  X  X nnotation mode X . The system
From the technical point of view, RAT is conceived as a plug-in for the most common Office Automation suites and web based WYSIWYG editor controls to endow these tools with advanced and yet general-purpose annotation capabili-ties. These prototypical plug-ins (one for MS Word 2010 and one for a web browser) are conceived to store annotations (and their context) into a remote server, where the Graph DBMS OrientDB 4 is used to guarantee persistence of the Directed Acyclic Graph structure of the RAT annotations.
From the TP case we collected the precise requirement to have the system display the annotation of a multimedia target as close to the target as possible. If the annotation pertains to multiple targets and these are in the same page, the annotation must be displayed as much in between as possible; otherwise the system should display the annota-tion as close to the first target as possible. Thus, the main problems at stake with the development of RAT regard two http://code.google.com/p/orient/ aspects on which we are currently working: first, the exten-sion that makes RAT process also non-textual elements (at first in web pages) within a document, such as images and arbitrary lines (what we call  X  X cribbles X  to hint at the typi-cal handwritten side notes of paper-based documents), and create annotations by letting users anchor them to any part of these document elements. Second, at the GUI level to improve the current straightforward interface: how to dis-play meaningful shortcut commands; how to display mul-tiple comments and labels close to their targets, especially when there are many of them accumulated over time; how to render semantic annotations in terms of visual clues (e.g., colors, font formatting) in a clean and clear way; how to al-low users switch between a page layout of the annotated artifact (i.e., the usual way where comments are attached to the document in the side margin) and an alternative visu-alization of content and comments that results from filters enabled by the semantic annotations so that these comple-mentary ways to display content is neither disorientating nor overloading. These problems are only partly technological ones, but they rather regard how users of a specific set-ting (with their typical skills, needs and expectations) can exploit the fruits of the additional effort of annotating the shared content. This point is specifically addressed in the next section.
As said previously, RAT is just an annotating tool. Yet, for users to find annotating of some value and this additional effort worth of being paid, it is important to define what to do with the annotations produced; i.e., what kind of func-tionalities the system must provide especially in regard to the semantic annotations. This is what we call the design of the functionalities enabled by RAT, a task that can be seen as its customization to a specific application case. Moreover, RAT can look  X  X imple X  in its conception and reference model but this essentiality does not make it necessarily  X  X asy X  to use; or clear to the user what advantage there is for her in annotating things. Thus, in order to make annotation user-friendly and convenient in a collaborative setting, RAT is intended to employ visual shortcuts and icons that ag-gregate the targeting and annotating functionalities at GUI level in a more contextualized manner.

Generally speaking, the customizations that are necessary to make RAT more suitable to address the specific needs of a cooperative setting regard the definition of: 1. predefined (and eventually extendible) lists of seman-2. specific iconic shortcut controls that can simplify the 3. a three-dimensional permission table that specifies what 4. a set of rules by which annotations and their anchored
In Figure 5 we indicate in a tabular form the main in-terventions of customization of RAT that we discussed with the users involved in the Technical Policy case described in Section 2. In particular, the list of semantic annotations reported in such table had been drawn on the basis of the qualitative research performed at the specific setting via a series of interviews with the coordinator and a number of key agronomists, and observations of the meetings where amendments were collaboratively discussed.

Provided the usual magmatic way in which points to dis-cuss could emerge and be referred in extempore comments, semantic annotations would enable the tool to make order out of them and present meaningful threads of discussion in a structured way and in a Forum-like manner, while leaving users free to express their points as they feel. The pro-posal of support that is enabled by semantic annotation is intended to be provided in two different phases of the TP amendment process. On the one hand, in the phase of collaborative commenting/amending of a document and according to the adopted convention, automatic rearrange-ment of comments and interventions would make the tool display them as close as possible to the pertinent targets:  X  X orrigenda X  first, top valued or agreed upon first, associ-ated to their explanations and related discussions (to possi-bly extract from not necessarily sequential interventions) On the other hand, before and during the final co-located meeting (be it virtual or face-to-face), the rearrangement could be exploited when the final report has to be generated by reporting highly agreed proposals at the top, for their
Indeed, this approach raised a discussion about the pos-sibility to have available private annotation spaces flanking the shared one. However, this opportunity would require a deeper investigation of the underlying integration policies and was discarded. easy consolidation, while highly controversial points could be endowed with the pertinent threads of discussion. In so doing, RAT is customized to address the main problems that actors used to face in the TP amending process: mainly to reach an acceptable consensus within the community of experts on what amendments to provide the Regional au-thority with for the final drafting of the policy document. In this case, the functionality to comment either paragraphs of the TP document (possibly by proposing punctual cor-rigenda of its parts) or previous comments in some sort of discussion thread is aimed at surrogating some of the de-bates that, without such support, would have required ex-tensive and expensive co-located meetings before the final and resolving one, whose output is the TP enriched with a well-contextualized and clear set of proposals of amendment. In short, the intended use of RAT considers that users are always left free to annotate their own comments or portions of comments: the more they do it, the better chances that their interventions could be reported in a contextualized way in the right place in the report and be referred to the right targets and points so as to improve their visibility during the meeting and the chances their point could be really un-derstood and taken in consideration.

The important thing to remind is that RAT does not nec-essarily impose an annotation schema. Users would be able to annotate the TP freely: we expect in real cases to ob-serve conventions and good practices emerge about how to make a proper target with respect to the content to amend. These conventions are purposely left external with respect to the application, as it would be difficult to embed them and probably useless. For instance, in the TP case annotation by user-defined keywords was deliberately prevented, not to create unnecessary  X  X oise X  on the shared virtual space.
Our empirical investigations showed that various forms of annotation are used to support cooperation in situations where asynchronous interaction occurs with the mediation of a shared inscribed artifact. Annotations in this case play the twofold role of conveying additional content that enriches the target document, and of supporting either implicit or explicit steps of the discourses going on  X  X round and about X  this content.

The core idea to recursively associate an additional con-tent to any kind of document element is however not enough to support the richness of the collective conversation the an-notation tool is called to support; yet it is the main pre-condition. The additional content that is conveyed by and through the annotations enables a reorganization of the con-tent according to specific and highly situated needs: these needs are expressed in terms of rules that let various dis-courses emerge and that produce  X  X hematic threads X  from those mutually nested annotations by requiring users the limited effort to semantically annotate some of those anno-tations. RAT attempts to achieve this flexibility by com-bining nowadays widespread habits of Web 2.0 users: tag-ging, commenting, creating links and connections between the available textual resources.

The development of an annotation tool is then part of a broader research agenda that can be briefly summarized in terms of reaching the goal to convey various types of awareness promoting information (what we called API in [7]) through affordances that can be partially conveyed by the system but more importantly interpreted by the users through pertinent policies and conventions [8] and their computa-tional counterparts, i.e., setting-specific rules [6, 5]. Anno-tations are one of the main means to achieve this goal, as they are grounded on long-established practices of appropri-ation and use of habitual artifacts.

The idea leading this research agenda is to build a con-ceptually unified framework where supports of Cooperative Work and Knowledge Management are available and coher-ent with each other [7], and to integrate specialized func-tionalities defined to address the (ever evolving) needs of specific settings on the basis of empirical studies.
Another extension under consideration regards to allow the anchoring of an annotation to an arbitrary number of targets belonging to two or more different electronic docu-ments: this would allow to draw relationships across a whole document management system and would contribute to cre-ate an electronic  X  X eb of artifacts X  as the domain of dis-tributed care, among other domains, impose to consider. Here the challenge is the combination of simplicity of usage, clarity of presentation and richness of added value for the users who are willing to pay the effort of annotating their resources. Related to this need, but with different aims, it is the management of private places of annotation that should complement what is shared and put into  X  X ommon (information) spaces X  [25]: here the challenge is even more demanding since the main problem to be solved is the in-tegration of different and possibly conflicting meanings as-sociated to the chosen labels [22], a situation that recalls the collaborative dynamics occurring across communities of practice and the concept of boundary object [28]: indeed, a tool that makes no distinction between free-text and se-mantic annotations could address that seeming (but yet ex-tremely fruitful) contradiction of an artifact that is  X  X eakly constructed in common use, and [...] strongly structured in individual-site use X , as the former type of annotation would support common use and discussion, while the latter type would enable a reorganization of content according to some individual site structure or model.

The scenario targeted by this research agenda requires to consider the  X  X tructures X  [23, 17] that are progressively consolidated within a community during its evolution and to build technological supports that are malleable enough to adapt to their continuous development: here is where the main challenge lies, irrespective of the setting at hand.
