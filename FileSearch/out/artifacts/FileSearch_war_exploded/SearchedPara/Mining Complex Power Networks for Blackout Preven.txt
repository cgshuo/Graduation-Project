 Following the recent devastating blackouts in North America, UK and Italy, blackout prevention has attracted significant attention, though it is known as a notoriously difficult task. To prevent the blackout, it is essential to accurately predict the instable status of power networ k components. In the large-scale power network however, existing an alysis tools fail to perform accurate and in-time prediction of component instability, because of the sophisticated structure of real-world power networks and the huge amount of system variables to be analyzed. To prevent the blackout, we need an accurate and efficient method that (a) can discover interesting features and patterns relevant to the blackout, from the highly complex structure and ten thousands of system variables of a power network, and (b) can give accurate and fast prediction of system instability whenever required, so that the network operator can developed for power network instability prediction. The proposed method consists of two ma jor stages. In the first stage, a novel type of patterns namely Local Correlation Network Pattern (LCNP) is mined from the structure and system variables of the power network. Correlation rules, which are useful for the network operator to locate potentially instable components, can be further ge nerated from the LCNP. In the second stage, a kernel based ne twork classification method is developed to predict the system instability. By testing on a real-world power network (the New England system), we demonstrate that the proposed t ool is effective in predicting system instability and thus highly useful for blackout prevention. 
Database Management ]: Database Applications  X  Data mining Keywords: Graph mining, power networks, blackout prevention Since mid 1990s, the world-wide electric power industry is reformed from the traditional regulated, vertically integrated utility into a competitive, deregulated market. Along with the market deregulation, the security of the electric power network becomes a severe challenge, because the power system is currently operating under more stressed condition with much more uncertainties in comparison to the past. Recently, severe blackouts have been observed in USA, UK, Italy and several other countries [1]. Blackouts are catastrophes with serious long-term consequences for the national economy and population, blackout prevention has therefore attracted great attention from both the academic society and industry. 
To effectively prevent blackouts, it is essential to predict which component of the power network will become instable , so that corresponding measures can be taken to fix these components or separate them from the network [2]. In practice, predicting the system instability is a highly difficult task because:  X  Feature extraction . No mature theory is currently  X  Fast prediction . In real power networ ks, the instability of 
In this paper, we report a data mining based tool developed to meet the above two major challe nges. Our method consists of algorithm is implemented to search the Local Correlation Network Pattern (LCNP) . To accelerate the search process, we take advantage of two im portant properties: the upward closure power network. These two proper ties assure that LCNPs can be efficiently mined from a large-scale power network. The LCNP constructed based on LCNPs, the challenge of feature extraction is therefore met in the first stage. 
Based on the LCNPs identified in the first stage, a series of classifiers are constructed in the second stage as the instability predictor. The classifiers employ a graph kernel to explicitly take into account the topologi cal information of the power network, so as to achieve the state-of-art performance. When an instable component occurs, the proposed method can immediately predict the potential ly instable components, thus satisfies the  X  X ast-response X  requir ement of blackout prevention. 
Based on the above design, we implement a prediction tool of power network instability. The developed tool is tested on a real-world power network, the New England system [3]. Promising results are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed tool. 
The rest of the paper is or ganized as follows. Section 2 introduces the necessary background materials. The proposed methods of correlation pattern mining and instability prediction are discussed in more detail in Section 3. In Section 4, the experimental results of the proposed method are reported. Afterwards, the research relevant to this study is reviewed in Section 5. Section 6 finall y concludes the paper. In this section, we give brief introductions to some necessary background materials. Theoretically, a power networ k can be modeled as an undirected graph . where V is a finite set of vertices and } 2 : { =  X   X  e V e E is a set of edges . 
In a real power system, there is only one edge between a pair of vertices, and no edge is connec ted with two identical vertices. In other words, a power network has neither multi-edge [4] nor loop [4]; the power network is therefore a simple graph [4]. 
From a power engineering point of view, the vertex of a power network is called a bus [2]. A bus can be either a load [2] or a generator [2] in the power network. The edges of a power network are named as branches [2]. In practice, loads, generators and branches can all become instable; therefore, the proposed method should be able to predict the instability of all these components. 
In following sections, it is necessary to calculate the distance between two components, which can be both buses and branches. We therefore give several definiti ons that are slightly different from standard graph theory. In a power network ) , ( E V , a path is a component sequence where E e V v theory, the ends in a power network. Two components are said to be connected if there is at least one path between them. The length of a path with k components is defined as k -1. The distance between two connecting these components. 
Each component in the power network has many system variables that may be correlated with the instability. The system variables of a typical generator are shown in Table 1. Which of these variables are relevant to the instability remains unclear. A real power network can contain more than ten thousand buses and a lot more branches, thus have ten thousands of system variables. Building a model of st ability analysis based on these variables is therefore a nontrivial task. The blackout is essentially the consequence of power system instability [2]. In real power networks, a component becoming instable can cause the instability of many other components in a cascading manner, which is known as the cascading failure [1] of a power network. To prevent the blackout, it is essential to interrupt the cascading failure process by anticipating the next instable component and taking necessary measures. Currently, the cascading process is not well-studied. The initial instable component may occur due to the loss of generating units, breaker failures, common tower, and common right-of-way circuit outages, etc. However, what factors and conditions trigger the following instable components is still unclear. Therefore, proposing a method, which can identify these essential factors and conditions, is a major objective of this study. 
Theoretically, a system compone nt can become instable in several different ways, which lead to different stability problems. In practice, transient instability [5] has been the dominant stability problem on most systems, and has been the focus of much of the industry X  X  attention concerning system stability. Therefore, we also focus on transient instability in this study. An informal definition of transient in stability is given as follows. 
D EFINITION 2: A power system is transient instable [5] if the system is unable to maintain synchronism when subjected to a large disturbance. It will result in large excursion of generator angle and is affected by nonlin ear power-angle relationship. 
In practice, a component can be determined as transient instable by checking its voltage (V), active power (P) and reactive power (Q) . We plot the P and Q of a bus that is becoming instable in Fig. 1. As clearly observed, the P and Q diverge when the bus becomes inst able. Voltage can also follow a similar pattern when a com ponent is becoming instable. 
In the developed tool, we firs tly determined the class label ( stable or instable ) of each component in a training instance. Afterwards, the system variables correlated with instability are identified by constructing LCNPs. Classifiers are finally trained based on LCNPs for inst ability prediction. The proposed LCNP is based on the correlation analysis [6], which is a well-established met hodology in classical statistics. We roughly introduce the basic ideas of correlation analysis as follows. 
Consider two random variables } , { we say two events event pairs ) , ( ), , ( ), , ( ), , (
X and Y are said to be correlated . Similarly, if another random variable } , { if ) , , (
X , Y and Z are correlated if any of the eight combinations of their values is dependent. 
Figure 1 System response of active and reactive power in an 
The above definition of correlation can be further generalized to the random variable with k possible values. 
D EFINITION 3: Consider m random variables where the i th variable are said to be correlated if any of the of their values is dependent [7]. 
In this study, each be correlated with instability, such as the ones listed in Table 1. Because most of these variables are continuous, several discrete values are defined on each of the variables by a domain expert to values of voltage ma y be defined as { rise, drop, oscillate }. 
The correlation of a set of random variables can be statistically tested with the chi-squared test [6]. Assume m random variables
X has the training data consisting of n instances. We describe each instance of T as a value V v v v v number of training instances having value v , and ) ( number of instances whose } ,... {
The null hypothesis of the chi-squared test is called the hypothesis of independence , which indicates that: 
The basic idea of chi-squared test is to determine whether the real frequency of value v significantly differs from its expectation. The chi-squared te st is performed based on the assumption of independence. We thus denote the expectation of k i v n v p
The chi-squared statistic can then be calculated as: 
It is proven that chi-squared statistic (2) follows a chi-squared distribution [6]. Therefore, on an  X  level confidence [6], we can reject the null hypo thesis and conclude correlated if 
A set of variables correlation pattern . Theoretically, there are a huge number of correlation patterns can be mined if m is large. Two important properties are therefore introduced in following sections to restrict the pattern space and identify the correlation patterns that are most interesting and relevant to instability prediction. The proposed method employs kernel based classifiers to predict instability. The kernel methods for classification are therefore briefly reviewed for completeness. 
Consider a set of n instances, each of wh ich can be described class label } 1 {  X   X  whose output is selected as the estimated class label. In kernel following optimization problem: 
In (4), C trades off between regularized and empirical risk, H function that evaluating the empirical risk. L can usually take the following choices: ) 1 , 0 max( ) , ( fy y f L  X  = (SVM), (logistic regression). 
To handle the nonlinearity of data, a symmetric kernel function, which should be positiv e definite, can be applied to transform the original data into some high-dimensional feature space. Mercer  X  X  theorem [8] guarantees that for every positive definite kernel function k , there is a map  X  into an inner product space, such that for every that &gt; =&lt; ) ( ), ( ) , ( In this section, the proposed method is introduced in more details. We firstly introduce the main ideas of the proposed method. Afterwards, instability pr ediction is formul ated into two sub-problems. The two sub-problems are then addressed in Sections 3.3 and 3.4, respectively. Stage 1 -Feature extraction . We have two important problems to answer. What kind of factors s hould be determined as relevant to instability? How to efficiently mine these factors from more than ten thousands system variable s? The correlation analysis is selected because it is well-established in statistics and has many successfully applications. Furt hermore, we would prefer a correlation measure that is us er-independent. Chi-squared statistic is selected because th ere is no need to choose ad-hoc values of user-defined parameters, such as confidence and support. Mining correlation patt erns from a power network is challenging because of its co mplexity. Two properties, the upward closure of correlation patterns and locality of the power network, are introduced to enable us to search only a small proportion of the entire pattern space. Stage 2  X  Instability prediction . In this study, a crucial issue to consider is how to take into a ccount the topological structure of the power network. Existing resear ch [9] shows that, considering the graph structure may significa ntly improve the performance of graph classifiers. Therefore, a kernel based method, which can explicitly model the network structure, is selected in the proposed method. The proposed method relies on the assumption that, two linked vertices are likely to have similar class labels. This assumption, which is used to design a regularization condition, will be explored in following sections. Consider a power network ) , ( E V . We assume each bus (vertex) and branch (edge) can be described by a set of system variables d R X  X  . Note that X can be different for different buses and branches. Suppose we observe the training data T with n instances. Each instance consists of the system variables X and class labels y of every network component (bus or branch). The problem of instability prediction can be separated into following two sub-problems: 1. Given a network ) , ( E V and training data T , determine 2. Given a network ) , ( E V and training data T , train A large-scale power network cont ains more than ten thousands buses and far more system variab les. For a given component, it is impossible to test every system variable in the network. To restrict the search space, two important properties are utilized in the proposed method. 
The first property is that, correlation patterns are upward closed , which can be formally stated as follows: 
P ROPOSITION 1: Given m random variables corresponding training data T , and suppose ) ... , ( correlation pattern defined on of ) ... , ( pattern. The proof of Proposition 1 can be found in [7]. 
According to Proposition 1, if a set of variables is determined as a correlation pattern, we no longer have to test any of its superset because they are all correlation patterns. Therefore, only the minimal correlation patterns should be mined. What we are searching is essentially the border between correlated and uncorrelated variable sets. 
D EFINITION 4: Given m random variables corresponding training data T , and suppose ) ... , ( correlation pattern defined on not correlation patterns. The second property comes from the power system theory. Intuitively, in a power system, a component can only influence another component via its neigh boring component. As illustrated in Fig. 2.a, the system variable s of Bus 1 can only influence bus 2, then influence bus 4 indirectly. In Fig. 2.b, when the system is separated into two electrical islands, Bus 1 is not correlated with the instability of Bus 4; because Bus 1 is not connecting to any component that can influence bus 4. network, the system variables of instability of whose system variables are correlated with the instability of Figure 2 Illustration of loca lity property in a power network Output : A set of LCNPs from ) , ( E V and T . For each variable X in VAR, add ) , ( S X in CAND; 
COR includes the variables of component ) ( X C , or (ii) ) ( X C While d i  X  ;
The proof of Proposition 2 can be found in [2]. Proposition 2 implies that, to predic t the instability of a component, we need to neighboring components). Propositions 1 and 2 motivate one of need to (i) search the local power network, and (ii) mine minimal correlation patterns. These considerations lead to the problem of mining local correlation network patterns . 
D EFINITION 5: In a power network, a variable X is called a d -order local variable of component C , if the distance between its corresponding component ) ( X C and C is no greater than d . 
D EFINITION 6: Consider a variable set ) ... , ( power network, ) ... , ( correlation network pattern (LCNP) of a component C if, (i) it is a minimal correlation pattern, and (ii) k i X order local variables of C . 
Intuitively, mining LCNPs of C is equivalent to mining minimal correlation patterns only in the components that are close to C . This can be effective for instability prediction because Proposition 2 assures that the influence of the components far from C can finally be observed on the neighboring components of C . Propositions 1 and 2 give rise to an efficient algorithm mining LCNPs. The algorithm is conceptually illustrated in Table 2. 
Consider a target component C and denote its stability status as } , { unstable stable S  X  . To mine the d -order LCNP, all the 1-order local variables stored in a list namely VAR. Chi-squared test is then applied to determine whether variable sets ) , )...( , ( ), , ( correlation patterns. The correla ted patterns and uncorrelated patterns are stored in two lis ts, COR and UNCOR respectively. Afterwards, all sets P , whose subsets of size 1  X  P are all in UNCOR, are selected and a dded into COR or UNCOR according to its result of the chi-squared test. This process continues until no new set can be added into COR and UNCOR. 
All the 1-order LCNPs are stored in COR now. We continue to mine 2-order LCNPs by adding all 2-order local variables of component ' C are uncorrelated with C , all the components that connect C only through ' C , cannot be correlated with C according to Proposition 2 (see Fig. 3). These components as well as ' C need not to be considered in the process of mining 2-order LCNPs and therefore their system variables are not added into VAR. Based on the new VAR, similar procedure as described above is repeated to identify all 2-order LCNPs. This process continues until d -order LCNPs are all finally identified. Based on LCNPs, a kernel ba sed classification method is proposed for instability prediction. In the proposed method, a classifier is constructed for each component that either (i) has previously become instable in historical data, or (ii) is identified as an important component by a domain expert. Suppose l components are selected for cons tructing classifiers. For each component l i C the LCNPs of training instance, each instance ) , ),...( , ( corresponding class labels } 1 {
In the proposed method, the cla ssifier of each component is designed to be a linear classifier where network structure is not consider ed, constructing the instability formulated as a standard kernel learning problem 
Introduce the kernel function = ) , ( and let the kernel gram matrix be )], , ( [
To take into account the network structure, a method namely graph Laplacian [10] is employed in the proposed instability components. The graph Laplacian of a power network is defined as follows components are expected to be similar. Combining (7) and (8), the instability predictor can be finally formulated as  X  ) , ( f S L implies that the classifiers have small errors in training data; (ii) a small approximately a linear function of its local features; (iii) a small gF F T implies that f is smooth on the network. 
In practice, a power networ k can be considered as statistically static , because any change of the network structure requires large investments and a long execution time, which usually can be several months. Therefore, the instability predictor can be trained and maintained off-line. On the other hand, the trained because its time complexity of classifying is linear to the dimension of explanatory vector X . Therefore, the proposed method well satisfies the requiremen ts of instability prediction. The proposed methods are implemen ted and tested with a real-world power network, the New England system [3], located in USA. The New England system is a regional power system that serves 6 states, including Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. Currently it includes more than 350 separate generators and more than 8000 miles of transmission lines. A simplified network structure, which includes the essential co mponents of the New England system, is illustrated in Fig. 4. 
Figure 4 Simplified network structure of the New England 
In the experiment, the system data include more than 300,000 instances, each of which consists of all the system variables in the New England test system. The LCNPs of every bus in the system are mined firstly. Then for each bus, 10 LCNPs with the greatest 2  X  statistic values are selected as the classification features of the instability predictor. 200,000 instances are randomly selected as training data, while the other 100,000 remains for testing. We report some of our results as follows. Table 3 shows the most significa nt LCNPs of 6 important buses in the NE system, which are identified by the domain expert. We system variable of component i . VAR can be any system variable listed in Table 1. Some interesting observations can be discovered from Table 3. For some buses such as bus 3 and 4, only 2-order LCNPs are mined. This implies that the local system variables of bus 3 and 4 directly correlate with their instability. On the other hand, most LNCPs of bus 7 and 8 have an order of 3. It means that most 2-order correlation patterns of bus 7 and 8 are insignificant, because the LCNP is a minimal correlation pattern. These observations clearly demonstrate the necessity of mining LCNPs. If we only calculate the correlations between instability and every system variable independently, we will miss the highly correlated variables that can only be identified by higher order LCNPs. 
A surprising discovery is that, the system variables of a bus may not be correlated with its instability. For example, no justifies that the inst ability predictor should be constructed based on the LCNPs, rather than its own system variables, as discussed in Section 3.4 
Another usefulness of LCNPs is to locate the component with low influence. For example, Bus 5 is directly connected with Bus 4 and 8. However, none of it s variables are correlated with later on. 
To help understand the correla tion patterns, some correlation rules can be further generated fr om LCNPs. For instance, we can derive a correlation rule from LCNP { P (9), P (11), S (7)}, as follows: It means that, the probability that Bus 7 will be instable given the conditions on the left-hand-side of the arrow is 96.7%. The correlation rules can be highly-useful for the system operator to determine potential instable co mponents and ta ke necessary actions. 
Another way to make the LC NPs more understandable is drawing the histogram. For example, the histogram of { P (9), P (11), S (7)} is given in Fig. 5. 
The proposed predictor is constructed based on the LCNPs mined in the first stage. As mentioned in the previous section, 200,000 instances are randomly se lected as training data. We denote TP as the instances that are correctly classified as instable, and FP as the instances that are incorrectly classified as instable. The precision and recall of the proposed instability predictor can be defined as: 
We also train a Support Vector Machine for each bus in the system. The SVM of Bus i is constructed completely based on method and SVM are reported in Table 4. Obviously, the proposed instability predictor outp erforms SVM both in terms of precision and recall. This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. From a data mining point of view, this research is closely related analyzing graph structured data. The work on graph mining frequent patterns in graph structured data. Effective methods have been proposed to mine frequent sub-trees in incremental polynomial time [11]. However, th e general frequent sub-graph approaches therefore focus on employing various heuristic strategies or restricting the sear ch space [12-15]. The frequent sub-graph mining problem is fu ndamentally different from the instability prediction problem , because frequent sub-graph mining aims at identifying frequ ent patterns from a large amount of graphs. In our problem, on the other hand, we expect to estimate the relationships between different system variables in only one complex graph. The frequent sub-graph mining methods therefore are not applicable in our problem. 
Another category of methods deals with predictive graph mining, which is closely re lated to our problem. Some researchers represent the graph by its frequent sub-graphs, then apply a kernel to the pattern se ts corresponding to these frequent sub-graphs [9, 16-17]. These met hods are not applicable because they are based on the frequent sub-graph mining, which is not applicable as mentioned above. By defining an appropriate kernel on graph, kernel base d classification methods can be employed to utilize the graph structure and obtain superior performance [18-20]. However, these methods consider every vertex in the graph has identical features, which is different from our problem setting. Therefore, th ey need further modification to be applied in the instability prediction problem. 
From power systems point of view, maintaining the system stability is the most important task for system operators either in a regulated or deregulated envir onment. In many occasions of system contingencies, system op erators often have to make a decision within a very limited time in order to retain system stability. However, there are many factors contributing to system stability and it is extremely diffi cult to make sound decisions by system operators. In a deregulated environment, in addition to the traditional system side impacts there are also impacts from the electricity market mechanisms, which almost double the complexity in decision making. 
It is well known that traditional stability analysis methods, such as online contingency assessment or dynamic security assessment (DSA) [21], require considerab le computational cost for a realistic power system. Other traditional numerical analysis methods [22-23] have similar difficulties. With increasing expansion of modern power systems, the corresponding system operational data are exponentially increasing. It is desirable to have reliable and fast algorithm s to perform such duties instead of the traditional time-consuming stability assessment approach. Blackout prevention is a challenging yet important problem due to its huge economic and social impacts. Exis ting stability analysis tools fail to identify essential factors relevant to the blackout and give in-time predictions. We developed novel methods for instability predic tion, which achieve two major objectives: 1. Effective feature extraction : By mining Local Correlation 
Network Patterns, the power system variables relevant to the blackout can be effectively identified and employed to construct the instability predictor. 2. Fast and accurate prediction of instability : The developed tool employs a kernel method to predict the instability. The proposed method can explicitly ta ke into account the network structure, thus more appropriat ely handle the power network. 
The developed tool is tested with the New England power system, which is a real-world power network. Its effectiveness is proven by obtaining promising experi ment results. This research is an important first step towards data mining in power engineering. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first data-driven method to deal directly with the blackout prevention problem and fill the gap.
