 In this work, we show the importance of multidimensional opinion representation in the political context combining do-main knowledge and results from principal component anal-ysis. We discuss the differences of feature selection between political spectrum analysis and normal opinion mining tasks. We build regression models on each opinion dimension for scoring and placing new opinion entities, e.g. personal blogs or politicians, onto the political opinion spectrum. We apply our methods on the floor statement records of the United States Senate and evaluate it against the uni-dimensional representation of political opinion space. The experimen-tal results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in explaining the voting records of the Senate.

We know that  X  X ogito, ergo sum X , and we also know that where there is thinking, there are thoughts. When thoughts are expressed out, they become opinions. The ubiquitous nature of opinions decides their complexity of dimensional-ities. Yes, in reality, opinions are always complicated and composed of multiple perspectives. We seldom choose our positions taking into account only one single aspect; we ac-tually make decisions under comprehensive considerations. And the goal of opinion mining is exactly to discover and reproduce opinions without losing their explanatory power of the world.

Most existed researches in opinion mining focus on some uni-dimensional issues, e.g. in product review [5] [4], they usually feature in polarity analysis on the positive-negative dimension or the objective-subjective dimension; In political opinion mining [2] [1], computer science researchers always simplify the opinion space into the single left-right or liberal-conservative dimension. They all yield the problem that the single dimension bears restricted capability to explain the realistic opinion distribution.

In political opinion mining, the opinion space is even more multidimensional. Single dimension of  X  X iberal X  and  X  X onser-vative X  X orks fine when all we want is a binary classification, but challenges lie in that many realistic political phenomena such as a Conservative votes for a Democratic candidate in the election cannot be explained in this simplified model. Aware of all these, the political scientists proposed the con-cept of Political Spectrum 1 which refers to a multidimen-sional opinion space where each geometric axis models one political dimension. Examples of the so-said dimensions in-clude the traditional left vs. right, free trade vs. protection-ism, attitudes towards personal freedom, religious beliefs, etc. And 2-Axes or 3-Axes coordinate systems 2 based on these dimensions were also proposed as possible representa-tions of the political opinion spectrum.

In this paper, we formally identify and define the prob-lem of political spectrum analysis, compare it with the other sentiment analysis and opinion mining tasks, and justify the importance of multiple political dimensions measured in the explanation power of it on official political behaviors such as voting records in the congress. We answer the questions of why we need political spectrum analysis and how better it will be when more dimensions are brought into the opin-ion analysis space. We introduce DW-Nominate scores, the dominant quantification method of political standings and take them as the target variables for the regression model as an attempt to prove the correlation between the speech records of politicians and the voting records of them.
One dominant coordinates system in the political spec-trum analysis which is widely used in academic political sci-ence studies is the DW-Nominate scores developed by Poole http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political spectrum/ http://www.politicalcompass.org/ and Rosenthal [3]. It features in estimating the position of legislators in the United States Congress, using a weighted utility model of their roll call voting records. This score is presented in two dimensions, the first dimension is the well-know liberal-conservative dimension, usually interpreted as the various attitudes of legislators in government interven-tion of the economy; the second dimension is a weighted dimension compared in significance to the first one with a dynamic weight varying along congresses. It used to be more significant in the early days of the United States before the Civil War representing the North-South divergence; and now it is more like a supplementary dimension with the weight 0.4163 compared to weight 1.0 of the first dimension, pick-ing up political standings in the view of traditional values, social lives, and civil rights.

We provide two examinations on the voting records in the Senate and the DW-Nominate scores to justify the ex-istence and necessity of the multidimensional political spec-trum analysis.

We collect the roll-call voting records of each senator dur-ing the 110th Senate sessions, which is composed of 442 voting of bills. For each bill, the value 1 means the senator voted  X  X ea X , -1 means the senator voted  X  X ay X , and 0 means the senator was absent in the voting. So the voting records are presented in a vector of 442 elements. We thus construct the bill-senator decision making matrix for this data.
We also get the DW-Nominate scores for the 100 sena-tors of the 110th United States Senate from the Voteview website 3 . In this data, each senator has a pair of scores for each dimension which are ranged in [-1.0, 1.0]. We scale the scores to [0.0, 1.0] and take them as the dependent variables of our regression models. Figure 1 illustrates the distribu-tion of DW-Nominate scores in the Senate: the red squares in the figure are republicans, blue circles are democrats, and yellow triangles are independent senators. http://www.voteview.com/ Figure 2: Principal components and their propor-tion of variances
Principal component analysis (PCA) finds a smaller set of synthetic variables called principal components from the original set of variables, the high-dimensionality of variables is reduced but the variance information is retained in the new set. Principal components are extracted in decreasing order of importance measured in the proportion of variance, and are orthogonal to each other. We apply PCA to the roll-call voting record, taking the voting of bills as observations, and the senators as variables. The goal of this analysis is to find out what voting patterns exist in the record, and the patterns guide the voting choices of the senators. Thus linear combinations of the senators are expected to be found out in which each senator plays either a positive or negative role towards the final pass of the bill. So each selected principal component of this data set is exactly a linear combination of the senators which represents one voting pattern, that is, one perspective on which the senators hold to decide their standings of the bills.

Figure 2 shows the discovered principal components and their proportion of variances. The first principal component yields a proportion of 0.476, and the second principal com-ponent yields a proportion of 0.204, and the proportion of variance diminishes rapidly from the third principal com-ponent. The cumulative contribution rate of the first two principal components is 0.680.

The results justify the existence of the multidimensional political spectrum in the Senate. The first two components, explained as two voting patterns, are especially significant compared to the others although they still cannot provide complete coverage of the spectrum. Here we note that one interpretation of the first dimension is the left-right voting pattern, and the second dimension is the social rights vot-ing pattern, but different interpretations are still possible to exist and be reasonable, while interpretations of the other small principal components become more and more difficult and usually cannot bring any more benefits for the studies.
The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength of linear dependence between two sample variables. It is always between -1 and 1. We calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient for the DW-Nominate scores in the two dimensions, it is -0.16326. This shows that the two dimensions have low or no association and for the purpose of this work, we consider them orthogonal.
We conduct lemmatization and POS tagging before the training process and calculate TF * IDF as the value of features.

Unlike other opinion mining tasks, we have a special defi-nition of Opinions in the political spectrum analysis. Opin-ions in this context are not necessarily directly detectable based on the subjective-objective lexical feature selection methods. Instead, any words, either subjective or objective, either noun or adjective, could be the indicator of political orientations of people. For example, nationalists might be more likely to cite the name of the historical national heroes and wars in their addresses, and environmentalists might be more likely to talk about greenhouse gases, animals, forests with elegant literary style. So what is the most powerful fea-ture set for political spectrum analysis? And are adjectives still the dominant opinion indicator as in other opinion min-ing tasks? We address these questions in our experiments.
We run the Lemmatization instead of Stemming on our feature set. Stemming usually results in a chop-off of the ends of words into the stem form which is usually not even a real word. It helps to sum up derivatives but inevitably loses the part-of-speech information which is crucial in our analysis. Lemmatization does a similar job with Stemming but will return the dictionary form of a word and save the part of speech information for us. Examples of our lemma-tization like:
We use the MontyLingua 4 Python Natural Language Pro-cessing library for lemmatization and pos-tagging in this study. We select lemmas tagged as Noun, Verb, Adjective or Adverb as four of our candidate feature set, and all the four sets together as the fifth feature set.
The choice of regression algorithms is derived from the nature of our regression problem. We have a large feature set with more than 10,000 lemmatized words ranked by their TF*IDF scores. We can X  X  use the traditional subjective-objective tagging since in our context, since any word could be opinionated as an indicator of political jargons. And we are dealing with a flock of the most talkative guys in the world who vocationally vie with each other to stand out from the rest, which in this study means they share different http://web.media.mit.edu/  X  hugo/montylingua/index.html

 Aware of these problems, we choose the Support Vector Regression (SVR) as our target regression algorithm. SVR shares the same mathematical foundations with SVM, thus the model produced by SVR only depends on a subset of the training data because outliers that lie beyond the margin controlled by threshold  X  will be ignored to contribute to the cost function. It helps to reduce the noise information in our dataset. Also SVR handles the potentially non-linear relationship between features and scores with the usage of different kernel functions.
 We experiment on three kernel functions. The Radial Basis kernel function (RBF), the Polynomial kernel, and the linear SVR. The hyperparameters of them are trained through cross-validation. We use the SVR tool provided by libsvm 5 , and we also use Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) as a baseline model. Experiments are repeated on five lexical feature sets.
We collected three different types of data in this study:
We first downloaded the DW-Nominate scores for the 100 senators of the 110th United States Senate. Each senator has a pair of scores for each dimension which are ranged in [-1.0,1.0]. We also downloaded the voting records for each senator, which is composed of 442 voting of bills. For each bill, the value 1 means the senator voted  X  X ea X , -1 means the senator voted  X  X ay X , and 0 means the senator was absent in the voting. So the voting records are presented in a vector of 442 elements.

We also crawled the floor statement records of each sen-ator through the Project Vote Smart website 6 , which is a non-profit organization that provides detailed information for all the incumbent members of pubic offices in the United States. Floor statement is the best speech records repre-senting the political orientation of senators because of it X  X  consistent among senators and also regularly and formally given in the Senate. The basic statistics and samples of this crawled floor statement dataset are summarized in table 1: Table 2 shows samples of the floor statement dataset.
We remove those senators who are no longer incumbent from our senator dataset, since their floor statement records are usually not publicly available after their retirement. And we also remove those who did not serve the full term of office http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/  X  cjlin/libsvm/ http://www.votesmart.org/ State Senator Statements Tokens Arizona MCCAIN 708 105212 Massachusetts KERRY 459 81856 Kentucky MCCONNELL 139 17773 Pennsylvania SPECTER 136 74859 West Virginia BYRD 23 8225 Table 2: Samples of the floor statement dataset Feature Set SVM Regression MLR RBF POLY LINEAR Noun 0.05178 0.06553 0.05292 0.09027 Verb 0.05590 0.05820 0.06338 0.20058 Adj 0.04723 0.06323 0.06313 0.93407 Adv 0.05748 0.05814 0.08886 0.23944 All 0.05107 0.06626 0.05077 0.09007 Table 3: Regression Performance on the first dimen-sion to reduce the absence of voting rate in the dataset. The remaining dataset features 88 senators who have at least served 6 years in the Senate.
We run the Leave-one-out cross-validation on both di-mensions separately. The regression performances on the two dimensions are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4 re-spectively. The evaluation criteria we use here is the Mean Squared Error, which measures the average of the square of the difference between the estimator and the quantity to be estimated.

As shown in the experimental results, the regression mod-els achieve good performances in estimating the senators X  DW-Nominate scores on both dimensions using their floor statement records.

In this study, we address the importance and explanatory power of political spectrum analysis in political opinion min-ing and discuss the differences of feature selection between political spectrum analysis and normal opinion mining tasks and test them in the experiments. We want to develop more semantic-intensive political spectrum analysis methods in the future that will further improve the performance of the regressions and other related tasks.
