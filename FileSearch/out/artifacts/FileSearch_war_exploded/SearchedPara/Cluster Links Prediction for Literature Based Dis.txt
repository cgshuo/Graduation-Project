 The potential impact of a scientific article has a significant correlation with its ability to es tablish novel connections between pre-existing knowledge [1-2]. Discovering hidden connections between the existing scientific lite rature is an interesting yet highly challenging information retr ieval problem [2]. Literature based discovery (LBD) uses computational algorithms to discover potential hidden connections between previously disconnected sets of literature [3]. Most of the current LBD methods focus on analyzing latent semantic features in texts but are usually computationally demanding. In particular, they do not aim at predicting novel discovery links between clusters of literature. literature is a promising yet unexplored LBD approach. This approach is potentially scalable and effective. For example, incorporating structural features of Web pages has increased the effectiveness of many large-scale IR systems [4]. The bibliographic structures of scien tific papers make it possible to view a corpus of literature as a complex network of nodes (articles) and links (citation rela tionships) in which recognizable communities or clusters can be observed, each representing a distinct research field [5]. Consequently, potential hidden connections between disparate fields might be found from among non-overlapping clusters that do not have any existing link between their members yet exhibit a high propensity to converge in the future. problem. We view disjoint literature sets as disjoint clusters in citation networks. Our method s earches for hidden connections between disjoint clusters whose member nodes show high probabilities in forming future links . To this end, we address two research problems. The first pr oblem is to group papers into clusters of distinct research areas. We compare the accuracy of well-known community detection algorithms, such as LOUVAIN and INFOMAP [5], in detecting research field clusters from citation networks of physics literature. We evaluate the quality of these clusters using purity, Rand Index, F-measure and Normalized Mutual Information [5-6]. Since ground truth communities are usually unknown, we also propose using alternative textual coherence m easures such as Jensen-Shannon divergence [7].
