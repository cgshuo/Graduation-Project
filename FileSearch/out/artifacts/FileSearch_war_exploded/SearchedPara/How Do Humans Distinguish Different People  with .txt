 This research investigates how humans distinguish different people with identical names on the web to improve web people search. We asked subjects to cl assify 20 pages of web people-search results for each of 20 person names and analyzed their decision processes through questionna ire, protocol analysis, and interview. We found that keywords, vocations, works (for a real person, works are those made by th e individual and, for a fictional person, works are those in which the individual appears), facial distinguishing individuals and a knowledge-structure model based on the experiment X  X  results. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  Selection process Distinguishing Individual Model, Knowledge-Structure Model The popularity of web people searches continues to rise as the number of people about whom the web provides information increases. Finding information about people on the web is one of the most common activities of Internet users [1]. Person name disambiguation, or distinguishing people with identical names, is becoming more and more important in web searches. There is much research that separates web pages automatically. Currently, the accuracy of person name disambiguation is not sufficient. We investigate how humans dis tinguish different people with identical names on the web to improve web people search. We describe the method and results of our experiment in Sections 2 and 3. We propose a model for distinguishing individuals and a knowledge-structure model in Section 4. We discuss the significance of our research in Section 5. We used 14 subjects (9 males and 5 females with an average age of 25). We collected 400 web pages (HTM L files) comprised of 20 web people-search results for each of the 20 Japanese person names used in a related work [2]. At least one of the individual names is famous enough for the authors to identify; however, most are not known to the subjects. We identified which page belongs to which person by referring to Wikipedia, we b pages, and so forth. A total of 58 individuals were found in the 400 web pages. We developed a site for the experiment. We asked the subjects to classify the above 20 web pages for one person name using our developed site. For each person name, we assigned two subjects. We analy zed their decision processes by questionnaire, protocol analysis, and interview. For each person's name, the procedure of the experiment is as follows. (1) We first conduct a questionnaire survey to obtain knowledge (2) The subject distinguishes the 20 web people-search results. (3) After distinguishing pages, the subject answers the When the subject participates in an experiment of another person's name, steps (1)-(3) above are rep eated. When all experiments are completed for the subject, we conduct a final interview. We check whether the assigned person number per one page is right to determine accuracy, which was 81% (See Table 1). Note: Name: person name; No.: num ber of individuals; S: subject. Among the 40 results (20 person names * two subjects) of the questionnaire, eight results (20%) were for known names. For real person names, the subjects answered that they did not know these individuals directly, but knew of them through media such as TV. For one fictional person name (a comic book character), a subject answered that he was aware of this individual by reading the comic. We found that the rate of browsing sites differs between known and unknown names. 35% of subj ects browsed sites for known names, while 64% for unknown names. We think that, for known names, the subjects knew something about at least one individual of that name and they identified that person by looking at the titles or snippets of the page. keywords in the results of our questionnaire survey. The number of discriminative keywords was 329 and that of characteristic keywords was 124. For example, for the questionnaire result for individual 1 commentator) for person name 1, the discriminative keywords were baseball , Yomiuri (name of a baseball team), monster (nickname), comment , Kobayashi (rival person's name), blank (known for blank day of contract), ball , Egawaru (coined-term), and nine (number of players on a baseball team). One characteristic keyword for the individual was baseball . We classified these terms into eight categories (keywords, vocations, works, related person na mes, histories, images, URLs, and place names) manually. The categories were set by analyzing data. Although we instructed the subjects to provide descriptive terms, some subjects answered w ith non-terms, such as photos or URLs. For the former, we created an image category and, for the latter, a URL category. Terms not classified into the seven categories (vocations, works, re lated person name s, histories, images, URLs, and place names), were classified into keywords. Figure 1 shows the result of this classification. For the discriminative keywords, th e top four were keywords (175, 53%), vocations (72, 22%), works (27, 8%), and related person names (24, 7%). 175 keywords were classified into those related to vocations (128, 73%), works (12, 7%), hobbies (8, 5%), sites (6, 3%), personalities (2, 1%), attribut es (2, 1%), and others (17, 10%). 72 vocations included 27 organizations and 12 positions. For the characteristic keywords, the top four were keywords (59, 48%), vocations (44, 35%), work s (8, 6%), and related person names (8, 6%). 59 keywords were classified into those related to vocations (35, 59%), hobbies (7, 12%), works (5, 8%), sites (4, 7%), attributes (3, 5%), personalitie s (2, 3%), and others (3, 5%). 44 vocations included ten organizations and four positions. This included 54 real individuals (121 written results) and four fictional individuals (seven writte n results). We classified the discriminative and characteristic keywords by real and fictional individuals. Figure 2 shows the num bers of keywords, vocations, individuals. For real individuals, the works are those made by that individual. For fictional individuals, the works are those in which that individual appears. For real indi viduals, the related person names the person names are those of other characters in the works in which the fictional individual appears. Figure 2. Keywords of top four categories for real and fictional individuals. keywords, the top two are keywords and vocations followed by works and related person names. 78% (127/162) and 61% (35/57) were related to vocations for discriminative and characteristic keywords, respectively. The results for the fictional individuals differed from the real individuals. The top four of the discriminative keywords are keywords, works, vocations, and related person names. The top three characteristic keywords are works, keywords, and related person names with no vocation. 46% (6/13) and 100% (2/2) are related to works for discriminative and characteristic keywords, respectively. Overall, from our questionnaire i nvestigation, we can conclude that keywords are most important for distinguishing individuals, followed by vocations, then works, and then related person names. When the individual is a real person, information related to the person's vocation(s) is important. Wh en the individual is fictional, information related to works in which the character is included is important. As some subjects spoke little during the experiment, we analyzed 20 data (20 person names * 1 subj ect). We extracted 242 elements and classified them into about th e same eight categories as in the previous sections. See Figure 3. The importance of keywords, vocati ons, and works is the same as in our questionnaire analysis. We found that checking face images is important (22 out of 23 images) to distinguish individuals, which we did not ascertain through the questionnaire analysis. We also found that checking sites that include the linked pages is important. When there is little information about an individual, for instance, he or she simply posted on news or blog sites, information about the sites is important to distinguish the individual. In addition, when the Amazon), these sites provide important clues. Characteristic answers included:  X  X  browsed web sites because there was no knowledge about unknown people to identify individuals. X   X  X  imagine something when I distinguish individuals. X   X  X t is important to identify individuals whether I get achievement, and organizations. X   X  X  can identify people when I find one notable achievement. X   X  X acial images are important because I could obtain much information about the person. X  From the experimental results of unknown person names, we analyzed the features of individuals who are easy to identify. We identified eight features and classified them into four categories (facial images, content, quantity of information, and ease of separation). (1) Facial images (2) Contents (3) Quantity of information (4) Ease of separation Here, we define personal histories as events, including yearly information such as birth date. Based on the experiments, we pr opose a model for distinguishing individuals (Figure 4) and a knowle dge-structure model (Figure 5). The human tendency is to check a people search list from the top down. A person will observe the title, snippet, or URLs of the list and judge whether he can identify the individual using a knowledge-structure. When he can identify the individual, he separates the individual. When he cannot identify the individual or he wants to check the content further, he browses the web site. On browsing the site, he obtains information about the individual and a knowledge-structure for the individual is created or modified. He sometimes selects linked web pages to obtain more information. After that, he sepa rates the individual by checking the knowledge-structure models for individuals (when he has already created other knowle dge-structure models). The above process is repeated until the list is processed. A knowledge-structure model is knowledge about the individual that separates him. A knowledge-str ucture model is divided into two parts: knowledge about the individual and the site. Knowledge about the individual has two parts: facial images and text content. Text contents are divided into real and fictional individuals constructed from knowledge about the individual and relationships with other individuals. The knowledge on a real individual includes keywords, vo cations, works, and personal histories, while the knowledge on a fictional individual includes keywords and vocations. Knowledge about a site includes st ructure of the sites, URLs, and linked pages. The WePS-2 conducted a competitive evaluation on person attribute extraction on web pages [3]. As named entity recognition (NER) is used in most approach es, Artiles et al. investigated disambiguation and reported th at NER only makes a small contribution [4]. There is research that assigns labe ls to distinguish people. Wan et al. assigned titles (similar to vocations in this research) [5], Ueda et al. assigned vocation-related information including vocations, organizations, and works [6], and Mori et al. assigned keywords to person clusters [7]. investigated how humans identify different people with identical names on the web to obtain knowledge that is helpful for people search. We found that keywords, vocations, works (for an actual person, works are those made by th e individual and, for a fictional person, works are those in which the individual appears), facial distinguishing individuals. Sec ond, we proposed a model for distinguishing individuals and a knowledge-structure model based on the experiment X  X  results. We think our findings are useful (a) to consider person name disambiguation algorithms, (b) to develop a person search user interface, and (c) to develop a pe rsonal web to be distinguished from other individuals. We investigated how humans dis tinguish different people with identical names on the web to improve web people search. We asked subjects to classify 20 pages of web people-search results for each of 20 person names and analyzed their decision processes through questionnaire, protocol analysis, and interview. We found that keywords, vocations, works, facial images, and the names of related people are important for distinguishing individuals. We proposed a model for distinguish ing individuals and a knowledge-structure model based on the experiment X  X  results. This work was supported by KAKENHI (22500219).
