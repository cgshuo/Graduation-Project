 Given a large social graph, how can we model the engagement properties of nodes? Can we quantify engagement both at node level as well as at graph level? Typically, engagement refers to the degree that an individual participates (or is encouraged to partici-pate) in a community and is closely related to the important prop-erty of nodes X  departure dynamics, i.e., the tendency of individuals to leave the community. In this paper, we build upon recent work in the field of game theory, where the behavior of individuals (nodes) is modeled by a technology adoption game. That is, the decision of a node to remain engaged in the graph is affected by the decision of its neighbors, and the  X  X est practice X  for each individual is captured by its core number  X  as arises from the k -core decomposition. After modeling and defining the engagement dynamics at node and graph level, we examine whether they depend on structural and topolog-ical features of the graph. We perform experiments on a multitude of real graphs, observing interesting connections with other graph characteristics, as well as a clear deviation from the corresponding behavior of random graphs. Furthermore, similar to the well known results about the robustness of real graphs under random and tar-geted node removals, we discuss the implications of our findings on a special case of robustness  X  regarding random and targeted node departures based on their engagement level.
 H.2.8 [ Information Systems ]: Database Applications X  Data min-ing Theory, Experimentation, Measurement Social Engagement; Social Network Analysis; Graph Mining
Over the last years, there is a considerable interest on study-ing the properties and dynamics of social networks, arising from a plethora of online social networking and social media applications, such as F ACEBOOK , G OOGLE + and Y OUTUBE . Typically, users become members of an online community for several reasons (e.g., create new friendship relationships, use of applications offered by a platform, etc.) and a lot of research effort has been devoted to understand the dynamics of formation and evolution of those social communities. Characteristic example is the observation that indi-viduals decide to join a community based not only on the number of friends that are already part of the community, but also on the degree of interactions among these friends [5].

However, similar to the decision of becoming member of a com-munity, an individual may also decide to leave the network. Al-though in many of the popular social networking applications typ-ically users do not explicitly leave the network, the decision of de-parture can be expressed by inactivity, i.e., the user do not partici-pate in the activities of the community. Can we model and quantify the departure dynamics of individuals in a social graph?
In this paper, we are trying to answer the above question studying the property of user engagement in social interaction graphs. Typ-ically, user engagement refers to the extend that an individual is areas of sociology and economics, the problem of social engage-ment examines the engagement of individuals to products, services or ideas. Similarly, in the field of web mining, the property of en-gagement refers to the quality of the user experience, as expressed by the duration and frequency that a web application is used [6]. In the context of a social graph, the property of engagement captures the incentive of a user (node) to remain engaged. In other words, the property of node engagement can be considered as complemen-tary to the one of node departure.

Typically, an individual decides to remain engaged in the com-munity (instead of depart), based on the benefit that is derived by the participation. Intuitively, the benefit of a user is based on its neighborhood, i.e., the number of friends that are also part of the community. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the strength of in-teractions among the friends of a user, is also a crucial factor for being part of the community. Therefore, it becomes clear that the decision of a user to remain engaged is affected by the structure of its neighborhood. Suppose now that a user decides to dropout, due to its low incentive of being part of the community. This decision is possible to affect the engagement level of his neighbors, that po-tentially can depart as well. This effect can evolve in a within the graph, leading to a cascade of node departures.
In this paper, we model and study the engagement properties of real-world social graphs. Our approach capitalizes on recent results in the field of game theory, where the engagement property can be considered in a similar manner as a product adoption process [17, 12, 8]. In the case where individuals decide simultaneously whether to remain engaged or depart from the graph, the engage-ment level of each node can be captured by the properties of the k -core decomposition [22]. Based on this point, we propose mea-sures for characterizing the engagement at both node level as at graph level . We examine in detail the properties of a large number of real graphs, trying to better understand the engagement dynamics.

The main contributions of the paper can be summarized as fol-lows:
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the related work and Section 3 provides the necessary background. Then, in Section 4 we describe the model and the proposed engage-ment measures. Section 5 presents the experimental evaluation of our method, while in Section 6 interesting implications of our study are discussed. Finally, we conclude in Section 7.
In this section we review the related work, regarding the engage-ment dynamics in social graphs, as well as other applications of the k -core decomposition. In the very recent literature, there has been presented some game-theoretic models for the problem of product adoption in networked environments [17, 12, 8]. These models form the basis of our approach and are described in detail in Sec-tion 4. To the best of our knowledge, the only related work that provides experimental study for the problem of node departures in social networks, is the work presented in [25]. There, the authors study two real social networks and examine whether the departure dynamics show similar behavior with the arrival dynamics. In the case of node departures, the authors of [25] observed that the ac-tive users typically belong to a dense core of the graph, while in-active users are placed on the sparsely connected periphery of the graph. As we will present later, the property of node engagement can be considered complementary to the one of node departure, and our approach provides a more refined modeling of the observations made in [25]. Moreover, related to our work can be considered re-cent studies about the formation dynamics of communities [5, 14], as well as studies about diffusion and contagion in social graphs [23, 4, 21, 10].

As we will present in Section 4, our method builds upon the properties of the k -core decomposition in a graph (see Section 3 for more details). Broadly speaking, the k -core decomposition has been applied in the past for extracting the most coherent subgraphs [22], graph visualization [26], identification of influential spreaders [13], and for studying [3] and modeling [9] the Internet topology. In this work, we examine one more application domain of the core decomposition in the problem of node engagement in social graphs; in contrast to the previous studies that mostly focus on the nodes of the best k -core subgraph, in this paper we are interested in the hierarchy produced by the decomposition, since it can provide meaningful insights about the engagement dynamics of the graph.
In this section we briefly discuss the properties of the decomposition [22], which is utilized by our method. Let ( V,E ) be an undirected graph, where | V | = n and | E | = m graph H is a subgraph of G , denoted by H  X  G , if H can be obtained from G after removing edges or vertices.

D EFINITION 1 ( k -CORE S UBGRAPH ). Let H be a subgraph of G , i.e., H  X  G . Subgraph H is defined to be a k -core of G if it is a maximal connected subgraph of G , in which all nodes have degree at least k .

D EFINITION 2 (G RAPH D EGENERACY  X   X  ( G ) ). The degener-acy  X   X  ( G ) of a graph G is defined as the maximum k for which graph G contains a non-empty k -core subgraph.

D EFINITION 3 (N ODE  X  S C ORE N UMBER ). A node i has core number c i = k , if it belongs to a k -core but not to any ( k + 1) -core.
A k -core of a graph G can be obtained by repeatedly deleting all vertices of degree less than k . Furthermore, the k -core decom-position  X  which assigns a core number c i to each node i  X  V can be computed efficiently, with complexity O ( m + n ) propor-tional to the size of the graph [7]. The most important point is that the k -core decomposition creates an hierarchy of the graph, where  X  X etter X  k -core subgraphs (i.e., higher values of k ) correspond to more cohesive parts of the graph.
In this section, we formulate the problem of modeling and quan-tifying the engagement dynamics in a social interaction graph. We begin by discussing the main factors that intuitively affect the de-cision of nodes to remain engaged or leave the graph. Then, we present the theoretical model used to approximate and capture the engagement behavior of nodes, as well as the proposed engagement measures at both node and graph level.
Our goal is to model and study the problem of node engagement in social graphs. Informally, the property of engagement captures the incentive of individuals to remain engaged in the graph, as op-posed to their decision of departure. In the context of this paper, we are interested in the engagement dynamics of individuals as well as of the whole system, from a network-wise point of view. In other words, we consider only the underlying graph structure of a social system, and based on its properties we derive measures that char-acterize the behavior in terms of engagement.

Typically, each individual that participates in a social activity  X  as expressed by his/her participation in a social graph  X  derive a benefit. In most of the cases, this benefit emanates from his/her neighborhood, as captured by the node degree in the social graph. Furthermore, one additional factor that affects the benefit of each individual is the degree of interaction among its neighbors [23], in the sense that if one X  X  friends tend to highly interact among each other, the benefit of remaining engaged in the graph could poten-tially be increased.
Let us now suppose that a user decides to drop out from his com-munity due to the fact that the incentive of staying has been re-duced. This decision will cause direct effects in his neighborhood, in the sense that some of his friends may also decide to depart. More precisely, a departure can become an epidemic (or contagion), forming a cascade of individual departures; nodes will decide to leave and this will also affect not only their neighbors but also the whole community. Therefore, according to the notion of benefit effects , individuals who want to incur an explicit benefit by remaining engaged, they should align their decision with the one of their neighbors [10].

Next, we present our model and the proposed measures for en-gagement in social graphs. Each node v  X  V  X  that corresponds to an individual  X  can either remain engaged in the network or can decide to depart. As we mentioned earlier, it is natural that the deci-sion of each node should be based on the decisions of its neighbors. The behavior of nodes as a system can be expressed using game-theoretic concepts, and more precisely it can be captured by the notion of networked coordination games [10]. That is, the prop-erty of engagement can be viewed as a network model based on direct-benefit effects: the node X  X  benefit of remaining engaged in the graph increases as more neighbors decide respectively to stay in the graph. This formulation has been extensively studied in the areas of game theory and economics. It is applied in situations where the nodes have to choose between two possible alternatives and the structure of the underlying social network affects the de-cision: for two neighborhood nodes u and v , there is an incentive to be aligned with the same decision, since that way they will both increase their benefits produced by the underlying interactions.
In a similar way, since the benefit of each node for staying in the network emanates from its neighbors, the problem can be modeled using similar concepts with the ones of coordination games. We consider that the nodes of the graph  X  which correspond to ratio-nal individuals/players  X  decide simultaneously whether to stay or leave. Each node i  X  V has the same set of possible strategies { 0 , 1 } , i.e., leave or stay in our case. Let x = [ x the vector that denotes the decision of each node. The payoff utility) of a node i given the behavior of the rest nodes (as captured by vector x ), can be expressed as: where benefit (  X  ) and cost (  X  ) are the node X  X  benefit and cost func-tions respectively and N i = { j  X  V : ( i,j )  X  E } is the neighbor-hood set of node i . In other words, the benefit of each node depends on its own decision x i and the aggregate decisions of its neigh-bors; this captures at a large extend the problem of engagement estimation, since in many cases a user remains engaged accord-ing to the degree of interactions with its friends in the community. Furthermore, every node i incurs a cost for remaining engaged in the graph, which depends only on its own action. While the actual form of the cost function does not need to be apriori known in the model, it is clear that a node will decide to stay engaged if its cost is not higher than its benefit. Let cost ( x i ) = k be the cost value of each node i  X  V . Then, according to Eq. (1), every node that will remain engaged should have non negative payoff, and there-fore  X  i ( x ) = |N x =1 i |  X  k , where |N x =1 i | is the number of neighbors that finally remain engaged, i.e., the degree of graph induced by nodes with decision x = 1 .

Thanks to some very recent results in the area of game theory, the equilibrium of this game corresponds to the core number each node, as produced by the k -core decomposition [17, 12, 8]. Figure 1: Probability of departure vs. core number. The dis-continuities in the plot correspond to zero (we plot only the cores from which nodes depart).
 The best response (Nash equilibrium) of each node i  X  V in the model presented above corresponds to the core number c i . In other words, in the case of equilibrium, every node in the induced subgraph S formed by nodes with x i = 1 should have minimum degree k , satisfying the property of c i  X  k . That way, no engaged node will have incentive to depart from S and no node outside i.e., in V  X  S , will have at least k neighbors in S in order to remain engaged after his departure. As noted by the authors in [17, 12, 8], the game has multiple equilibria, but the maximum one corre-sponds to the  X  X est X  k -core structure of the graph (i.e., In our case, we are interested in all nodes in the graph and not only on those that form the best equilibrium; as we will present shortly these nodes show interesting properties.
Having presented the basic theoretical model, we now proceed with the proposed measures for characterizing the engagement dy-namics on graphs. We are interested in studying the engagement properties at both node (local) and graph (global) level; further-more, we are interested in examining the behavior of specific sub-graphs  X  as produced by the k -core decomposition  X  which include nodes with specific engagement level.

Capitalizing on Proposition 1, we quantify the property of node engagement using the k -core decomposition, and more specifically the core number c i of each node i  X  V .

P ROPOSITION 2 (N ODE E NGAGEMENT ). The engagement le-vel e i of each node i  X  V is defined as its core number c Typically, nodes that belong to higher cores of the graph (higher core number), show better engagement and therefore it is less prob-able to depart (or, at least, the incentive to depart is lower). As we discussed in Section 4.1, the core number of each node is a rea-sonable metric (or estimator) to capture and model the engagement dynamics: nodes remain engaged if their neighbors (and the neigh-bors of their neighbors, etc.) also remain engaged. On the other hand, if a node decides to depart, this may affect the engagement level of its neighbors  X  which may decide to leave as well  X  forming a cascade of potential departures in the graph. This dynamic effect of cascades is naturally captured by the k -core decomposition and the core number of nodes.

Figure 1 provides some empirical observations regarding the de-parture of nodes  X  on data with available relevant information  X  that can be used to support our modeling approach. As it is difficult to access social graph data where nodes (users) explicitly define their departure time, we have examined two snapshots of the Internet topology (C AIDA and O REGON Autonomous Systems) with avail-able dropout information. Figure 1 depicts the probability of depar-ture vs. the core number c i of a node. As it can be observed, nodes that belong to smaller cores (close to the first core) are more prob-able to leave the graph, thus supporting our modeling approach. Moreover, this property is persistent for several time snapshots of the graphs.

Additionally, the proposed engagement metric can be considered as a more refined modeling explanation of the departure dynamics in social graphs, as very recently observed in [25]. The authors of Ref. [25] studied the behavior of user departures in social net-works and based on some inactivity criteria (e.g., in a co-authorship network, a user is considered inactive if he/she has not published a paper in a time period of more than five years), they observed that nodes which belong to the densely connected core of the graph mainly correspond to active users. On the other hand, inactive users (i.e., users that potentially have left the graph) belong to the periph-ery of the graph. In other words, the departure of nodes is propor-tional to their position in the graph, with nodes in the fringe of the graph presenting higher probability to dropout. Our modeling approach and the node engagement metric e  X  based on the proper-ties of the k -core decomposition  X  quantify in a precise manner the above structural observations.

We should note that, here we examine the dynamics of engage-ment (and thus of departure) by a simple model and metric, that approximates real settings and observations in a concise manner. However, we do not argue that the engagement of a user is solely proportional to his core number; other external factors may affect its behavior as well. Nevertheless, in the rather realistic case where each node decides to remain engaged for maximizing its revenue by the participation in the community  X  thus considering the deci-sion of its neighbors  X  the behavior can be modeled by the proposed metric.

Furthermore, as we will see in the experimental results, the de-gree of a node is not an accurate estimator of the departure dynam-ics: while high degree is necessary for achieving higher engage-ment and higher core number, the opposite is not always true. In many cases, high degree nodes have low core number because of the fact that their neighbors are not well connected among each ric able to capture both the size of node X  X  neighborhood as well as its connectivity. In Section 5 where the experimental results are presented, we also examine how other well-known structural char-acteristics of the graph (e.g., degree, triangle participation ratio, clustering coefficient) affect the engagement behavior.

Based on this model of user behavior, we also propose to study the characteristics of the subgraphs produced in the case of sim-ple scenarios, where nodes with certain engagement index k various values of k ) decide simultaneously to drop out. The sub-graph that remains after such types of departures is defined as the k -engagement subgraph G k .
 a integer parameter such that a node remains engaged in G if at least k neighbors are engaged. The graph G k which is induced by nodes i  X  V with engagement level e i  X  k is defined as the k -engagement subgraph.
 The k -engagement subgraphs correspond to interesting structures of the graph. Actually, for a specific value of k , subgraph resents the remaining graph, after the cascading effect where nodes net graph analysis. with engagement lower than k have left the graph. The properties of the remaining subgraph  X  as captured by G k  X  are crucial towards a better understanding of the engagement characteristics, as well as for examining the functional operation of the remaining graph. As we will present shortly, the size distribution of G k for various val-ues of k can inform us about the overall engagement level of the graph. Furthermore, it is interested to study whether well-known structural properties  X  such as the degree distribution of the graph  X  are retained after such types of nodes X  departures. We also note that, following the properties of k -core decomposition, subgraphs G k form a nested hierarchy G 0  X  G 1  X  G 2  X  ...  X  G k for the possible values of k , in the sense that subgraphs of higher belong to G k  X  X  of lower k .

Of particular interest is the subgraph G k that corresponds to the maximum value of engagement e . In terms of k -core decomposi-tion, the nodes with the highest engagement level e max are those who belong to the best k -core of the graph, i.e., k =  X   X   X  ( G ) is the degeneracy of the graph [22].
 k =  X   X  ( G ) be the degeneracy of the graph, i.e., the maximum k such that there exists a k -engagement subgraph. In our context, we consider this value as the maximum engagement level of the graph, i.e., e max =  X   X  ( G ) and we denote the Max-Engagement Subgraph The Max-Engagement subgraph is composed by the nodes of the graph that show the highest engagement level e = e max . More pre-cisely, each node i  X  G e max has degree d i  X  e max within implying that this set of nodes has potentially the lowest incentive to depart from the graph and thus it corresponds to the best engaged nodes. As we will discuss in Section 6, this subgraph also contains the most influential nodes of the graph, in terms of departure dy-namics.

Having defined the engagement index of each node in the graph as well as the notion of the k -engagement subgraphs, it would be interesting to summarize this information into one value capable to describe the engagement level of the whole graph. That is, each in-dividual node contributes to the engagement of the graph  X  accord-ing to its engagement index e i ,  X  i  X  V  X  based on the best core that the node belongs to. Ideally, in terms of engagement, it would be better to have a large fraction of the nodes of the graph belonging to largest cores, thus showing higher engagement. In the extreme case of the graph with the best engagement properties  X  which cor-responds to the complete graph K n = ( V K belong to the Max-Engagement subgraph and their engagement in-dex is equal to e i = | V K behavior, we consider the area under the curve of the cumulative distribution of the k -engagement subgraphs X  sizes. However, since the graphs do not have the same maximum engagement level e we normalize this value for each graph into the interval [0 , 1] on a simple normalization: Normalized e j = e j  X  min( e ) where j = 1 ,...,e max , min( e ) = 1 and max( e ) = e max plicity, we consider that all nodes in the graph have degree at least one, therefore the minimum engagement is 1 ).
 Pr( X  X  e ) be the cumulative distribution function of the sizes of the k -engagement subgraphs. Then, the total engagement level of a graph G , denoted as E G , is defined as the area under the curve of F ( e ) , e = [0 , 1] , i.e., Figure 2: Schematic representation of the engagement index E . The red curve shows an example of the cumulative distri-bution of the engagement level of the k -engagement subgraphs. The area under the curve (light blue region) captures the en-gagement properties of the graph. The orange colored curve shows the engagement level of the complete graph K n .
 Figure 2 depicts a schematic representation of the engagement in-dex E G . The horizontal axis corresponds to the normalized en-gagement value e , while the vertical axis represents the probability Pr( X  X  e ) that a node has (normalized) engagement level at least e (as produced by the sizes the k -engagement subgraphs). The values of E G are in the range of [0 , 1] , with higher values indi-cating graphs with higher total engagement level (larger area un-der red curve). In the case of the complete graph (orange colored curve), the probability that a node has normalized engagement at least e,  X  e  X  [0 , 1] , is Pr( X  X  e ) = 1 . In other words, every node in the graph has engagement e i = | V K size of the k -engagement subgraphs, for k = 1 ,...,e max to the size of the whole graph, i.e., | V K
Having presented the proposed engagement measures, we briefly discuss on an important point in the modeling approach followed by our method. Our approach and the proposed engagement measures are build upon the game presented in Section 4.1, which consid-ers that nodes have complete information about the structure of the graph [10, 17]. Although this assumption may not be very accu-rate in many settings where individuals should take a decision (to remain engaged or to depart in our problem), we consider that in this case is valid since our goal is to model and to provide a high level study of the behavior of individual nodes and of the graph as a whole, regarding their engagement properties. Thus, our study builds upon the fact that we have knowledge of the structure of the graph. In a typical application scenario of our approach, the ad-ministrator of a social graph (e.g., F ACEBOOK )  X  who has global knowledge of the structure of the graph  X  can use the proposed measures to examine the engagement dynamics of the graph and to potentially detect nodes that tend to leave, due to their low engage-ment.
In this section we present detailed experimental results of the proposed engagement measures, at both local (node) and global (graph) level. The experiments were designed to address the fol-lowing points:
P1: Study the characteristics of the engagement dynamics in real
P2: Examine how other graph features affect the engagement of
As we have already mentioned, we consider that the feasibility and applicability of our approach is supported by the results de-picted in Fig. 1 and by very recent observations about the depar-ture dynamics in social graphs [25]. Actually, here we present a more refined explanation of the departure dynamics, studying the complementary property of engagement. Furthermore, the time complexity of our approach is linear with respect to the size of the graph, as it relies on the computation of the k -core decomposition (see Section 3).

Table 1 presents the datasets used in our study. All of them are publicly available and correspond to well-known social and collab-oration networks (except from the last datasets used to support our modeling approach).
As we described in Section 4, a reasonable estimator for the en-gagement properties of a node is its core number, i.e., e V . One important aspect here is to examine the size distribution of the k -engagement subgraphs, i.e., the size of the subgraphs that contain nodes with engagement e at least k . That is, for the various possible values of parameter k (that depend on the graph), we study the properties of the k -engagement subgraphs. These characteris-tics can help us to further understand the engagement dynamics of real graphs, both at node and at graph level. Figure 3 (red curve) depicts the results for the real graphs presented in Table 1.
As we can observe, for most of the datasets, the distribution of the sizes of the k -engagement subgraphs is almost skewed, mean-ing that the highly engagement subgraphs (for larger values of are relatively small in size. In other words, most of the nodes in the graph have small engagement index e , while a few nodes are highly engaged. Of course, we should note that the size distribu-tions are not identical for all the graphs we have examined. Fur-thermore, the maximum engagement level e max as well as the size of the Max-Engagement subgraph G max  X  that corresponds to the tail of the distribution  X  present different behavior for some of the examined datasets. We will discuss these points next in the paper.
One important question here is if these observations regarding the engagement properties of graphs, capture the behavior of a real system  X  and thus can be characterized as patterns of real graphs. In other words, is there any difference between the G k  X  X  size distri-bution of real graphs and random ones? To answer this question, we have examined the engagement properties of a configuration model , i.e., a random graph model with the same degree distribu-tion as the original one. As we can observe from Fig. 3 (green curve), a random rewiring of the original graph causes a different size distribution for the k -engagement subgraphs. More precisely, for most of the examined datasets, the random equivalent graph shows a much lower number of engagement levels, but the size of the Max-Engagement subgraph is much larger compared to the original one  X  indicating different behavior in terms of engagement. This observation is somewhat expected; random graphs are known to have a large core and thus Max-Engagement subgraphs of rela-tively large size [19].

However, for a few datasets we have observed an unexpected but rather interesting behavior. For example, Y OUTUBE and E E
A LL social graphs show an almost similar size distribution be-tween the original graph and the random equivalent one. Addition-ally, E MAIL -E U A LL has a much smaller maximum engagement index e max compared to the random rewired graph. To better exam-ine this deviation as well as for having a more refined explanation graph with the same degree sequence as the original one. of the observed engagement properties, we have computed a set of high level characteristics of the k -engagement graphs. More specif-ically, we focus on the properties of the Max-Engagement subgraph G e max , trying to understand and capture which factors potentially af-fect the engagement properties of the graph.

Figure 4 depicts the relationship between some high level char-acteristics of the Max-Engagement subgraphs G e max with important global features of the graph (for the datasets of Table 1). We ar-gue that examining interesting correlations between graph features and the observed engagement characteristics, we can draw mean-ingful conclusions about the engagement dynamics of real graphs. Initially, we consider the relationship between the size of the full graph, i.e., | V | and the characteristics of the Max-Engagement sub-graphs, namely the maximum engagement level e max and the num-ber of nodes in G e max . As we can see from Fig. 4 (a), for the major-ity of the examined datasets (green colored squares), the size the graph shows an almost linear correlation (in log-log axis) with the maximum engagement level e max . However, Y OUTUBE (blue colored circle) and CA-H EP -P H (red colored circle) clearly devi-ate from this relationship (if we ignore these two graphs, Pearson X  X  correlation coefficient is  X  = 0 . 75 ). While Y OUTUBE corresponds to the largest graph of our collection, its e max value is relatively small. On the other hand, CA-H EP -P H has a relatively small size, while its maximum engagement level is extremely high. Thus, it seems that to achieve a higher e max value, the size of the graph is not the only responsible factor. That is, as we have already men-tioned, the existence of clustering structures in the graph plays a crucial role for the engagement properties.

Figure 4 (d) depicts the relationship between the fraction of closed triplets in the graph (triplets of nodes that form triangles) with the maximum engagement level. As we can observe, CA-H EP -P H the largest fraction of closed triplets in our collection as well as the highest e max value, although its size is relatively small. On the other hand, Y OUTUBE shows an almost opposite behavior. Despite its large size, the fraction of closed triplets and the maximum engage-ment level are relatively small (in Section 5.4, we present a more detailed examination about the relationship of the engagement and the existence of clustering structures in the graph).

Figure 4 (b) depicts the number of nodes in the graph vs. the number of nodes in the Max-Engagement subgraph G e max . Here, we can observe a more clear correlation between | V | and the size of G e max (Pearson X  X  correlation coefficient  X  = 0 . 6394 ).
Lastly, in Fig. 4 (c), we study the size of G e max vs. the of the graphs. We can observe two different behaviors in the stud-ied datasets. On the one hand, we have the collaboration graphs  X  formed by co-authorship relationships. Although they capture dif-ferent scientific disciplines, we can observe an almost linear cor-relation in log-log scale. Furthermore, in many cases, the size of G e max is almost equal to the maximum engagement level e max dicating tightly knit communities at this portion of the graph. For example, in the case of the D BLP co-authorship graph, the Max-Engagement subgraph corresponds to a set of around 115 author that have co-authored the same paper. On the other hand, the graphs from online social networking and social media applications, fol-low a different behavior: the maximum engagement level is kept below a threshold of about 100 and the values are close to each other  X  almost constant  X  although the datasets are of different size, while the number of nodes in G e max increases. This can be possibly explained by the nature of interactions in online social network-ing applications; although an individual can achieve a high number of friendship connections, the degree of collaboration  X  and simi-larly of engagement  X  among them is constrained to the threshold of around 100 nodes. We also note that, the value of e max matches the size of the best communities (around 100 nodes) ob-served by Leskovec et al. [16].
Having examined the properties of the k -engagement subgraphs, we proceed to the computation of the total graph engagement index E . As we described in Section 4, the global engagement proper-ties of the graph can be captured by the area under the curve of the normalized cumulative size distribution of the k -engagement subgraphs. That is, for each graph, we normalize the engagement level e in the interval [0 , 1] and we plot the cumulative distribu-tion Pr( X  X  e ) , i.e., the fraction of nodes with normalized en-gagement at least e . Since we are not only interested in the maxi-mum engagement level of each graph but on how individual nodes are distributed within the different levels (as expressed by the engagement subgraphs), we are able to compare the engagement properties of different graphs. Figure 5 depicts the results for the collection of graphs of Table 1. Furthermore, Table 2 shows the values that correspond to the area under curve. Figure 5: Normalized cumulative distribution function of k -engagement subgraphs. Each curve corresponds to the prob-ability Pr( X  X  e ) , i.e., the fraction of nodes with normalized engagement at least e . The area under curve captures the en-gagement index E G for the whole graph.

In the case of social graphs (Fig. 5 (a)), we can observe that the graph with the maximum engagement index E G is F ACEBOOK Although F ACEBOOK does not have a large maximum engagement level e max , nodes are well distributed within levels, with a  X  X ood X  fraction of nodes having high (normalized) engagement e . Looking Table 2: Graph engagement values E G for social (left table) and collaboration (right table) graphs. now at the collaboration graphs (Fig. 5 (b)), a first observation is that the D BLP graph shows the lower engagement index E G pared to the rest co-authorship graphs. One possible explanation is that D BLP covers several areas of computer science, with a signif-icant number of relatively  X  X ew X  authors. These authors, typically belong to lower cores of the graph, and thus their engagement is relatively low. On the other hand, the rest of the co-authorship networks correspond to more robust communities, where a larger fraction of authors (nodes) has higher engagement level.
In this section, we are interested to study the properties of the engagement subgraphs, under a simple scenario where nodes with low engagement e decide to depart. More specifically, we study the existence of self-similar properties in the k -engagement subgraphs and we focus on the simplest such property which is the existence of a skewed degree distribution. This property is crucial for the k -engagement subgraphs from several viewpoints. First of all, the degree of each node corresponds to an important structural charac-teristic and therefore it is interesting to examine to what extend it is preserved by the cascade of node departures. Furthermore, the existence of hubs in the k -engagement subgraphs is another crucial point, since  X  among other things  X  it is related to how fast infor-mation is disseminated in the graph and to the well known type of robustness under targeted/random node attacks [2]. Therefore, we are still interested to examine the major characteristics and func-tionalities of the graph after a cascade of dropouts.

Figure 6 depicts the cumulative degree distribution of the engagement subgraphs, under different values of k (note that, 1 corresponds to the whole graph). A first observation is that the shape of the distribution is retained for the examined values of other words, for the very first levels of engagement, an almost scale invariance is presented, with respect to the scenario of node depar-tures. However, we do not argue that this property is retained for all the engagement levels, i.e., e = 1 ,...,e max 3 . Similar properties hold for the rest datasets.

An interesting point here is to examine the diversity of nodes  X  in terms of degree  X  that finally depart. In our scenario, nodes with low engagement decide to drop out. How is this mapped to the degree distribution? Typically, we expect that the nodes which depart, correspond to low degree ones. The crucial point here is that the produced cascades can cause the departure of high degree nodes as well, since their engagement level may be reduced. This is actually the major difference between the problem of node de-partures  X  based on the engagement level  X  studied by our paper, compared to removals of nodes based on possible failures [2].
As we can observe from Fig. 6, for different values of tail of the distributions  X  that captures high degree nodes  X  is also affected by the cascade of low-engaged node departures. To make Figure 6: Cumulative degree distribution of k -engagement sub-graphs G k , for various values of k . Note that, the tail of the distribution also changes for different values of k . this observation more precise, we compute the correlation between nodes X  degree and their engagement index e . Clearly, high degree is required to achieve high engagement; however, the degree alone is not an indicator of high engagement. Figure 7 depicts the node engagement index e vs. the degree of each node (we focus only on four datasets of our collection). Clearly, a large fraction of high degree nodes show low engagement level, and thus it is more prob-able to depart. This is also an indication that the importance of some hub nodes in the graph diminishes, in terms of engagement dynamics. Lastly, we have examined this aspect in the case of ran-dom graphs with the same degree distribution as the original ones. As it can be shown from Fig. 7, these graphs show more smooth behavior compared to real ones; this is one more evidence about the differences in terms of engagement between real and random rewired graphs.
As we have already discussed, it is expected that the engage-ment level of a node should be closely related to local clustering structures of the graph, indicating increased level of collaboration among nodes of the same neighborhood. Actually, the authors of [25] report that the probability of departure is related to the over-all neighborhood activity of a node. In the more general problem of influence and product/behavior/idea adoption in a social system, the probability that a user will finally proceed with the adoption, is proportional to the size, as well as to the connectivity of the neighborhood [21, 5]. Furthermore, the high level characteristics presented in Fig. 4 (d), indicate a relationship between the fraction of closed triplets in the graph and the maximum engagement level. This is an interesting evidence, in the sense that in higher order engagement subgraphs (i.e., higher values of k ), a higher degree of cohesiveness exists.

In fact, the number of triangles that each node participates to, seems to be vital for its core number and therefore for its engage-ment index. Additionally, the fraction of closed triplets in a graph is closely related to the clustering coefficient  X  a measure that in-form us about the tendency of nodes to cluster together, forming Figure 7: Node engagement vs. node degree. Correlation be-tween engagement and degree for each node in the graph. Pur-ple squares correspond to real graphs and green circles to the random ones. For the real graphs, observe that high degree nodes can also have relatively small engagement. that the number of cores in real-world graphs depends on the global clustering coefficient, where graphs with higher global clustering coefficient tend to have larger number of cores. Figure 8: Average clustering coefficient per k -engagement sub-graphs G k . Observe that the clustering coefficient is gradually increasing for larger values of k = 1 ,...,e max .

Focusing now on the clustering properties of the k -engagement subgraphs, for different values of k ranging from k = 1 ,...,e we examine how the clustering structure (as captured by the clus-tering coefficient) is affected by the departure of nodes. Figure 8 depicts the average clustering coefficient (CC) of each possible engagement subgraph, for four datasets of our collection. As we can observe, the CC increases gradually as we are moving to of higher engagement, indicating more cohesive subgraphs with higher degree of interactions among nodes. Actually, this captures the expected behavior of k -engagement subgraphs, in the sense that nodes which belong to higher order G k (higher values of k http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_ coefficient . Figure 9: Node engagement vs. triangle participation score. Correlation of the node engagement index with the number of triangles that each node participates to. demonstrate stronger degree of collaboration with their neighbors and thus higher engagement.

Lastly, we consider the clustering properties at node level and we examine how the triangle participation score of each node (i.e., the number of triangles that each node participates to) is re-lated to the engagement index e i . Figure 9 presents the correlation of the engagement index e for each node vs. the triangle partici-pation score. It seems that the triangle participation score approx-imates better the engagement level of a node (compared to the de-gree), supporting also our intuition that the existence of triangles is vital for the engagement properties.
In this section, we briefly discuss some potential implications of our observations, regarding the property of engagement. As we presented in Section 4, the engagement of a node is proportional to its core number, and captures its incentive to remain in the graph. As we observed from the experimental results in Section 5, the size distribution of the k -engagement subgraphs is skewed, indicating that a large fraction of nodes typically show a relatively low en-gagement. Then, based on the size distribution, we were able to characterize the engagement properties of the whole graph. In that case, graphs in which a large portion of their nodes has high en-gagement level, correspond to more robust graphs in terms of de-partures. In other words, in such graphs, a relatively high portion of nodes (based on the size of the full graph) do not has incentive to depart.

However, an interesting behavior can possibly occur if we con-sider a scenario under which nodes can also depart independently of their engagement level. In other words, although there is no in-centive to depart, nodes decide to drop out possibly due to some ex-ternal factors. In that case, graphs with high engagement index will be vulnerable under targeted node departures, i.e., when nodes with high engagement value e decide to depart. That is, the  X  X isen-gagement X  cascade that will be formed, will have higher effect in the graph and potentially could cause a relatively large number of nodes to depart as well. In the more general case, according to the skewed size distribution of the k -engagement subgraphs (Fig. 3), we can say that real graphs tend to be robust under random node departures, but vulnerable to targeted ones. This mainly happens due to the fact that most of the nodes in the graph have relatively low engagement, while a few nodes show high engagement value.
Note that, this type of robustness assessment moves on a similar axis as the well known result about the robustness of real graphs under random/targeted node removals based on their degree. In that case, the seminal result by Albert and Barab X si [2] states that, due to the existence of a skewed degree distribution, real graphs are robust against random attacks but vulnerable to targeted ones (in the case of hub nodes). As future work, we plan to experimentally examine how such types of engagement-based departures affect the structural characteristics of the graph (e.g., connectivity, diameter).
In this paper, we have studied the problem of engagement es-timation in a social graph. Based on a game-theoretic model, we proposed several ways to examine the engagement dynamics, at both node level as well as at graph level.

The main contributions of the paper are the following:
As future work, we plan extend our study on more complex types of graphs, such as directed and signed graphs, where the engage-ment characteristics may behave in a different way. Furthermore, one important point is to further examine this new notion of robust-ness in real graphs, based on departures of individuals due to their engagement level and not by external attacks or failures.
