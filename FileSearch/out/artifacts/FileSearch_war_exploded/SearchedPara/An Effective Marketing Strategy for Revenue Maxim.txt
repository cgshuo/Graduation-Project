 Recently the influence maximization problem has received much attention for its applications on viral marketing and product promotions. However, such influence maximization problems have not taken into account the monetary effect on the purchasing decision of individuals. To fulfill this gap, in this paper, we aim for maximizing the revenue by considering the quantity constraint on the promoted com-modity. For this problem, we not only identify a proper small group of individuals as seeds for promotion but also determine the pricing of the commodity. To tackle the rev-enue maximization problem, we first introduce a strategic searching algorithm, referred to as Algorithm PRUB, which is able to derive the optimal solutions. After that, we further modify PRUB to propose a heuristic, Algorithm PRUB+IF, for obtaining feasible solutions more efficiently on larger in-stances. Experiments on real social networks with differ-ent valuation distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of PRUB and PRUB+IF.

Due to the advance of the Web 2.0 techniques, various kinds of websites have become parts of our life. Most peo-ple nowadays are used to sharing, seeking and obtaining information, and interacting with others through various social networking websites such as Digg, Slashdot, Face-book, and Twitter, to name a few. As more and more peo-ple join these social websites, the phenomenon of immense quantity of information flow and influence spread becomes prominent. This then motivates the utilization of this phe-nomenon, known as the  X  X ord-of-mouth X  effect, to bring sig-nificant potential benefits in many types of business such as viral marketing and innovation promotion. For example, a company can effectively promote its brand and new prod-ucts by involving a group of influential people spreading the good words over social websites. Hence, in very recent years, there is active research [2, 3, 9, 12] exploring the problem of influence maximization.

Existing works studied the influence maximization prob-lem generally based on two kinds of diffusion models, the Linear Threshold (LT) and the Independent Cascade (IC) models. In the LT model, the influence strength between a pair of individuals is modeled as a fixed weight, and the influence on an individual is described as cumulative. An individual is activated when the sum of the weights propa-gated from his/her activated neighbors exceeds his/her own threshold. The IC model assumes that each influence of one to another is an independent chance to activate the latter with a probability. On both models, the problem of influ-ence maximization aims at identifying a proper group (of a specified size) of individuals as seeds to have the number of activated people maximized. However, note that such in-fluence maximization problems have not taken into account the monetary aspect, which usually plays a crucial factor in people X  X  purchase decisions. That is, maximizing the influ-ence spread does not necessarily bring maximum revenue, as an individual may be very interested in a new smartphone, but does not purchase the smartphone due to its high price.
According to the studies in the fields of social psychology [1, 4] and economics [8, 13], one X  X  valuation towards a com-modity will be positively influenced by those that have pur-chased the commodity, which is known as the herd mental-ity or positive network externalities. In other words, people tend to imitate others in their consumer behaviors, which will result in irrational valuations of the commodity, i.e., higher valuations beyond their inherent valuations. Based on these phenomena, Mirrokni et al. [11] addressed the Rev-enue Maximization problem by incorporating the mon-etary concept into the maximization problem of influence spread based on the LT model. In the monetary LT model, the influence strength (or said weight) is transformed into the valuation concept, and the individual threshold is re-garded as the inherent valuation. One X  X  valuation of a com-modity is thus the sum of his/her inherent valuation and the valuation increment from social influences. An individ-ual then pays for a commodity and propagates his/her in-fluence whenever her/his valuation is larger than or equal to the pricing of the commodity. Consider the network shown in Figure 1 as an example, where the number contained in each node is the inherent valuation and the number on an edge from one node to another is the weight, i.e., the influ-ence strength. For the ease of illustration, without loss of generality, the function F ( x ) = x is used to transform the effects of the social influences cumulated on an individual into the valuation concept in this example. If f purchases the commodity, c  X  X  valuation is increased to $3 + F (1) = $4. If a , e , and f all purchase the commodity, the valuation in-crement for c is F (3 + 2 + 1) = $6 and c  X  X  valuation thus becomes $3 + $6 = $9. The objective of the revenue max-imization problem thus aims at determining the pricing of the commodity and identifying a seed group of individuals for promotion so that the total revenue is maximized.
However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works has taken a quantity constraint on commodities into account. Note that due to the consideration of marketing strategies or practical conditions, quantities of commodities are often constrained in the real world. For example, the scarcity fallacy usually makes commodities more desirable [14], as a company may want to release limited edition com-modities to boost customer desire. Another example is the case of promoting a concert, where the quantity of the con-cert tickets is constrained by the number of available seats. In this case, due to the schedules of the musicians or singers, it is hard to add more shows and the total number of concert tickets. Hence, selecting seeds to receive free commodities will reduce the quantities of commodities that can be sold. This makes the prior works unapplicable to determine the proper pricing and obtain maximum revenue. For example, suppose that the network shown in Figure 1 is considered, where the diffusion model with the monetary concept in the work [11] is adopted and the function F ( x ) = x is used to transform the effects of the social influence into the valuation concept. Without consideration of the commodity quantity, the maximum revenue is $28 obtained at the pricing of $7 with the seed group { d,f } . With the influence from { d,f } , a and e are the first to purchase the commodity, since both their valuations $2 + F (5) = $7 are equal to the pricing of $7. Then, b and c will subsequently purchase the com-modity due to their valuations $0 + F (2 + 4 + 4) = $10 and $3 + F (3 + 2 + 1) = $9, respectively. However, if the quantity of commodities is limited to 4, the revenue will de-crease to $14 since two free commodities given to the seeds d and f should be taken off first. In this case, letting the commodity be priced at $6 and choosing only d as the seed will be the best. Under the influence of d , a first purchases the commodity since its valuation $2 + F (5) = $7 is larger than the pricing of $6. Then, both b and c purchase the commodities due to their valuations $0 + F (2 + 4) = $6 and $3 + F (3) = $6, respectively. Finally, since a , b , and c all pay for the commodity sold at the price of $6, the maximum revenue is $18. Therefore, when the quantity of commodi-ties is limited, we argue the need of new approaches for the revenue maximization problem.

Specifically, we address the revenue maximization problem with a quantity constraint on commodities. Given a limited quantity of commodities and a social network with mone-
Figure 1: A network with the monetary concept. tary concept regarding to the commodity, the problem is to determine the pricing of the commodity and identify a small group of people, i.e., a seed group, to be the initial customers receiving freebies to help promote the commodity at the be-ginning, so that the total revenue is maximized. In this paper, we investigate this problem on the monetary-concept incorporated LT-model [11], and propose Algorithm PRUB (Pricing searching strategy using Revenue Upper Bound) to derive the optimal solutions. Then, we further revise PRUB to propose a heuristic Algorithm PRUB+IF (Pricing searching strategy using Revenue Upper Bound with Impor-tance Feedback) for better efficiency. Experiments on real social networks show the good effectiveness of PRUB and PRUB+IF, demonstrating the revenue maximization with and without a quantity constraint differs from each other.
In summary, the contributions of this paper are: 1. We are the first to address the general case of the rev-2. For the addressed problem, we proposed the optimal 3. Experiments on real social networks demonstrate the
To formulate the revenue maximization problem, in this section, we first describe the social network with the mone-tary concept, then explain how the social influences propa-gate over the network using the monetary-concept incorpo-rated LT-model [11], and finally define the revenue and the revenue maximization problem formally.

Given a commodity, a social network with the monetary concept, referred to as a monetizing social network , is a weighted digraph G = ( V,X,E,W,F ), where V is the set of individuals and for each individual v  X  V , his/her inherent valuation  X  v is carried in X . Usually, the valuation infor-mation X can be estimated and learned from questionnaires or historical sales data, with regard to the commodity [7]. For any individuals u,v  X  V , if u  X  X  purchase will directly encourage v  X  X  desire for the commodity, an edge from u to v , denoted as e uv  X  E ( E standing for the edge set), rep-resents the existance of the influence, and w uv  X  W repre-sents the influence strength as the weight on e uv . Adopt-ing the Concave Graph Model in the work [11], we con-sider a non-negative, non-decreasing, and concave function F : R +  X  R + with F (0) = 0 to transform the weights into the valuation concept. That is, given a set of individuals S directly exerting influences on an individual v , v  X  X  valuation towards a commodity will become  X  v + F ( P i  X  S w iv ).
Based on the monetary-concept incorporated LT-model [11], the propagation of social influences over the monetiz-ing social network happens whenever individuals adopt the commodity. An individual adopts the commodity if and only if 1) the pricing of the commodity is less than or equal to his/her valuation, or 2) this individual is an initial customer receiving a freebie. After an individual adopts the com-modity, he/she will then exert influences on his/her out-neighbors to encourage them and raise their valuations for adoption. The following shows an example of social influ-ences propagating over the monetizing social network.
Example 1. Given the monetizing social network in Fig-ure 1 and the concave influence function F ( x ) = x , consider the promotion of a concert. Suppose that the pricing of the concert tickets is $7 and the seed group is A = { d } . Influ-enced by d , the valuations of a , b , and f are increased by F (5) = $5, F (4) = $4, and F (2) = $2, respectively. The val-uations of a , b and f thus become $2+$5 = $7, $0+$4 = $4, and $0 + $2 = $2, respectively. Then, note that as the val-uation of a is equal to the pricing of the concert tickets $7, a also adopts the concert ticket and exerts influences on its out-neighbors b and c . The valuations of b and c thus increase to $0 + F (4 + 2) = $6 and $3 + F (3) = $6, respec-tively. After that, as no other individuals adopt the concert ticket, the influence propagation stops. Consequently, under d  X  X  influence, a will also adopt the concert ticket, and the valuations of b , c and f become $6, $6, and $2, respectively. Consider another example of the seed group A = { d,f } . Under the influence of d and f , the valuations of a , b , c and e are raised to $7, $4, $4, and $7, respectively. (Here d  X  X  influence on f is neglected since f as an initial customer has already adopted the concert ticket.) Hence, a and e adopt the concert tickets and exert influences. Consequently, the valuations of b and c become: In the end, a , b , c , and e all adopt the concert tickets since their final valuations are larger than or equal to the pricing of the concert tickets $7.

Here we define that the revenue comes from the number of people paying for the commodity and the pricing of the commodity. Recall Example 1 where the pricing is $7 and the seed group is { d,f } , and suppose that the quantity of the concert tickets is 4. The revenue is $7  X  2 = $14, since two concert tickets are used as free tickets given to d and f , and only two concert tickets are left for sale (even though a , b , c , and e all want to purchase these concert tickets).
Formally, given the quantity of commodities n , the pricing p of the commodity, and the seed group A , the revenue is defined as follows.

Definition 1. Revenue function. Given the quantity n , the revenue at the pricing of p with the seed group A is where  X  ( A )  X  A is the set of individuals adopting the com-modity under the influences of A .
 Table 1: (a) The maximum valuations; (b) the upper bounds of maximum revenue.
To increase the revenue, finding the proper pricing p and identifying a proper seed group A is important. Consider the same setting mentioned above, but with an empty seed group and the pricing set as $1. The revenue is R (4 , $1 ,  X  ) = $1  X  4 = $4, which is less than R (4 , $7 , { d,f } ) = $14. Since any company will expect to earn as higher revenue as possi-ble given a fixed amount of commodities, in this paper, we are interested in looking for such pricing and a seed group as initial customers that can bring maximum revenue. The proposed problem is formally defined as follows.

Definition 2. The RM w/QC Problem: Revenue Max-imization with a Quantity Constraint. Given a mon-etizing social network G = ( V,X,E,W,F ), a set of input prices P  X  R + , and a quantity of commodities n , the prob-lem is to determine the pricing p max  X  P of the commodity and find a seed group A max  X  V as initial customers, where | A max |  X  n , such that the revenue R ( n,p,A ) is maximized, i.e., ( p max ,A max ) = argmax
It can be shown that the RM w/QC problem is NP-hard. 1
In this section, for the revenue maximization problem, we first propose Algorithm PRUB (Pricing searching strategy using Revenue Upper Bound) that is able to derive the opti-mal solutions. Note that finding the optimal pair of p max A max in the revenue maximization problem is exhausted. Then, for better efficiency, a heuristic Algorithm PRUB+IF (PRUB with Importance Feedback) is introduced following the framework of PRUB.
To tackle the RM w/QC problem, Algorithm PRUB is de-signed to obtain the optimal solutions. As mentioned pre-viously, finding a proper pair of pricing and seed group is critical in this problem, since the revenue comes from the pricing of the commodity and the number of people paying for the commodity. A na  X   X ve approach for finding the optimal pair of pricing p max and seed group A max is to search at all p  X  P , enumerate all seed groups A , and calculate the cor-responding revenue R ( n,p,A ). The rationale of Algorithm PRUB is based on this na  X   X ve approach and prunes the search space by 1) progressively filtering out non-candidate pricing and 2) deriving an upper bound of the size of seed groups for each price. We illustrate the two ideas of pruning in the following.

Non-candidate Pricing Filtering. The first idea is to prune the searching on non-candidate pricing. Motivated by
For more details, please refer to http://arxiv.org/abs/ 1505.06286 . the concern of only maximum revenue, this pruning derives an upper bound of maximum revenue at each price, and utilizes an achievable global revenue r global that records the maximum revenue discovered so far to progressively filter out the pricing that will not result in higher revenue. That is, if an upper bound of maximum revenue at each price can be derived, PRUB then does not need to seek the seed group for maximum revenue at a specific price when the upper bound at this price is less than or equal to r global . As r is updated and increased progressively after the successful searching of the seed group at each price, the non-candidate pricing is also progressively detected and filtered out.
In order to infer the upper bound of maximum revenue at a specific price, the maximum number of individuals who have potential for adopting the commodity at this price is needed. To find out whether or not an individual has this po-tential, it needs to estimate the valuation of the individual. Therefore, in the following, we first introduce the definitions of maximum valuations and potential buyers for defining the upper bound of maximum revenue.

Definition 3. Maximum valuation. The maximum val-uation of an individual v is the valuation under the influences from all v  X  X  in-neighbors, which is denoted as
Definition 4. Potential buyer. An individual v is re-garded as a potential buyer at a specific price p if v has po-tential for adopting the commodity at p , i.e., X max ( v )  X  p . Definition 5. Upper bound of maximum revenue.
 Given a quantity constraint n , the upper bound of maxi-mum revenue at a price p is where m p is the number of potential buyers at p , i.e., m |{ v | v  X  V,X max ( v )  X  p }| .

Example 2. Given the monetizing social network in Fig-ure 1, the concave influence function F ( x ) = x , and a set of input prices P = { p | p  X  I + , 1  X  p  X  10 } , consider the promotion of a concert. Table 1(a) shows the maximum val-uation of each individual. Suppose the quantity of the con-cert tickets is set as 4. The corresponding upper bounds of maximum revenue for all prices are listed in Table 1(b).
In addition, to have better effectiveness of pruning by uti-lizing the upper bound of maximum revenue, PRUB searches the prices in a descending order of the upper bounds. Then, once PRUB discovers a price, at which the upper bound is less than or equal to the achievable global revenue r global the searching for the following prices (including the current price) can be ignored. Therefore, in the above example, PRUB will start the examination of the prices from p = $7, p = $6, p = $8,  X  X  X  , and so on.

Bound of Seed Group X  X  Size. The second idea for pruning search space is to avoid enumerating useless seed groups under a specific price. The inspiration is, under the consideration of a specific price p , it involves more than p quantities of commodities to be sold for finding the revenue higher than the achievable global revenue r obtained so far. When considering the price p , Algorithm PRUB then bounds the size of the seed groups as Algorithm 1: PRUB since the quantity of commodities is limited. Follow Exam-ple 2, and suppose the achievable global revenue r global $10. In order to find the revenue higher than $10, when searching at the price p = $7, PRUB expects more than 10 7 concert tickets left for sale and enumerates only the seed groups of sizes less than or equal to 2 (since the quantity of the concert tickets is set as 4). The searching on the seed groups of sizes 3 and 4 is thus pruned.

Note that incorporating the two pruning methods is sat-isfactory to the accuracy. Therefore, Algorithm PRUB is still able to derive the optimal solutions, even though the search space is reduced. The details of PRUB are presented in Algorithm 1. In the following, we show an example to illustrate how PRUB figures out the optimal pair of p
Example 3. Follow Example 2, and initialize p max , A max and r global as $0, an empty set, and $0, respectively. Accord-ing to the upper bounds of maximum revenue in Table 1(b), PRUB will consider the prices in the following order: p = $7, p = $6, p = $8,  X  X  X  , and so on.
 Beginning from the price $7, PRUB checks whether or not R bound (4 , $7) &gt; r global . Since $28 &gt; $0, PRUB looks for the maximum revenue at the price $7 by enumerating all the seed groups whose size is bounded by Equation (2) (includ-ing the size 0). First, for the empty seed group, no individ-ual adopts the concert ticket at $7. So PRUB goes to the size 1. Then, PRUB lists all the seed groups of size 1 since 1 &lt; 4  X  0 7 = 4. Among all the seed groups of size 1, PRUB finds the highest revenue R (4 , $7 , { d } ) = $7 (referred to Ex-ample 1). As $7 is higher than r global = $0, PRUB updates p max = $7, A max = { d } , and r global = $7. Before seeking the seed groups of size 2 for maximum revenue, PRUB ensures 2 &lt; 4  X  7 7 = 3. After all seed groups of size 2 are enu-merated, the highest revenue R (4 , $7 , { d,f } ) = $14 is found (referred to Example 1). Because $14 &gt; r global = $7, PRUB updates p max = $7, A max = { d,f } , and r global = $14. Later, note that 3 &gt; 4  X  14 7 = 2. The searching for the maximum revenue at the price $7 stops. The next price considered is $6. A similar process is performed until PRUB finds such a price p that r global  X  R bound (4 ,p ). In the end, the maximum revenue is R (4 , $6 , { d } ) = $18, where the pair of p and A max = { d } is the optimal solution.

Lemma 1. PRUB has an O (2 | V | | V | 2 | P | ) time complexity.
In this section, the heuristic algorithm PRUB+IF (PRUB with Importance Feedback) is proposed as a feasible solu-tion. The heuristic PRUB+IF differs from PRUB at the way of finding the most proper seed group at each price. Fol-lowing the framework of PRUB, PRUB+IF introduces the concept of pricing-sensitive importance , accompanying the contribution feedback from the out-neighbors, for selecting seeds in a heuristic manner, instead of listing all seed groups.
The main idea of PRUB+IF is that, an individual with greater potential for making others adopt the commodity should be regarded as more important. Selecting the most important individuals as seeds greedily is able to lead to a feasible solution. Then, the question is how to evaluate one X  X  potential for making others adopt the commodity. The intu-ition is about how many others will be encouraged and how much their valuations can be increased for approaching the pricing, under one X  X  influence. We then accumulate these effects to calculate one X  X  importance. Here only the effects on potential buyers should be included in the accumulation since only the potential buyers have possibilities of paying for the commodity. In addition, note that the individuals who newly adopt the commodity under one X  X  (direct and indirect) influence will further spread their influences to en-courage more others in adoption. In order to estimate one X  X  importance more carefully, the effects through influence cas-cades should also be included in the accumulation. There-fore, PRUB+IF introduces the pricing-sensitive importance that sums up the consideration of the normalized weights, the influence propagation, and the potential buyers in the measurement of one X  X  advantage in the commodity promo-tion at the given pricing. Then, the strategy is to select seeds in accordance with the pricing-sensitive importance.
In the following, we introduce the three key points, Nor-malized Weight, Feedback of Influence Propagation, and Potential-Buyer Filtering, in measuring the pricing-sensitive importance. Briefly, for each individual u , 1) the Normalized Weight is used to evaluate u  X  X  importance according to u  X  X  direct effect on another individual v  X  X  adoption; 2) the Feed-back of Influence Propagation is incorporated to evaluate u  X  X  importance towards v by considering also the indirect effects through influence cascades; 3) the Potential-Buyer Filtering is considered to derive u  X  X  pricing-sensitive importance from accumulating all u  X  X  direct and indirect effects on all the other potential buyers. 2 1. Normalized Weight.

 3. Potential-Buyer Filtering.
 The algorithm of PRUB+IF is presented in Algorithm 2. PRUB+IF uses the framework of PRUB as a base, and dif-fers from PRUB at the strategy for seed selection (Algo-rithm 2 Lines 12-15). In the following, we go through the de-tails of PRUB+IF. Similarly to PRUB, PRUB+IF initializes p max , A max , and r global , compute the upper bounds of max-imum revenue for all prices, and then considers the prices one-by-one in a descending order of the upper bounds of maximum revenue (Lines 1-3). At a specific price p , PRUB enumerates all seed groups while PRUB+IF iteratively picks up a seed until the size of the seed group A reaches the bound in Equation (2) (Line 11). Specifically, when con-sidering a price p , PRUB+IF first checks whether or not p is non-candidate pricing that has no chance to yield higher revenue than the achievable global revenue r global (Line 5). If p passes the pruning, PRUB+IF first calculates the rev-enue regarding to the empty seed group (Lines 7-8). Af-ter that, PRUB+IF expands the seed group by one seed at a time according to the pricing-sensitive importance  X (  X  ) in Equation (5) (Line 13). Each time the individual who has not yet adopted the commodity and has the greatest Algorithm 2: PRUB+IF pricing-sensitive importance will be selected into the cur-rent seed group (Lines 12-15). In the case of the newly ob-tained revenue higher than r global , PRUB+IF updates p max A max , and r global similarly to PRUB (Lines 17-18). Once the size of the seed group reaches the bound in Equation (2) (Line 11), PRUB+IF considers the next price. After all prices are examined, p max and A max are returned as the so-lution. The following example demonstrates the searching process of PRUB+IF.

Example 7. Follow Example 2, and initialize p max , A max and r global as $0, an empty set, and $0, respectively. Accord-ing to the upper bounds of maximum revenue in Table 1(b), the first price considered is $7. Since R bound (4 , $7) = $28 &gt; r global = $0, PRUB+IF tries to seek for higher revenue at the price $7. First, for A = {} , there is no revenue since the inherent valuations of all individuals are less than $7. After that, for selecting the first seed, PRUB+IF computes the pricing-sensitive importance of all individuals in a similar way as shown in Example 6: Hence, the first seed selected is d and the corresponding revenue will be R (4 , $7 , { d } ) = $7 (referred to Example 1). As $7 &gt; r global = $0, PRUB+IF performs the updates of p max = $7, A max = { d } , and r global = $7. Until now, the process for the first seed finishes, and PRUB+IF checks whether or not to continue selecting the second seed. Since | A | = |{ d }| = 1 &lt; n  X  r global p = 4  X  7 7 = 3, the pricing-sensitive importance of all individuals, except the individ-uals who have adopted the concert tickets, i.e., a and d , is calculated with respect to the current seed group A = { d } : Accordingly, f will be selected as the second seed and the revenue is R (4 , $7 , { d,f } ) = $14 (referred to Example 1), which leads to the updates of p max = $7, A max = { d,f } , and r global = $14. Until now, the process for the second seed finishes, and PRUB+IF checks whether or not to continue selecting the third seed. However, | A | = 2 reaches the bound n  X  r global p = 4  X  14 7 = 2 so that the searching at the price $7 stops.

The searching at the remaining prices p = $6, p = $8,  X  X  X  , and so on, is performed in the same manner as that at the price $7. In the end, PRUB+IF will report the pricing of $6 and the seed group { d } as the answer.

Lemma 2. PRUB+IF has an O ( n | V | 3 | P | ) time complex-ity.
In this section, we first provide the evidence that the rev-enue maximization problem with a quantity constraint dif-fers from that without a quantity constraint. Besides, we also show the approximation performance of PRUB+IF to PRUB. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of PRUB+IF, we further conduct experiments on larger real social net-works and compare PRUB+IF with other heuristics. All the programs are implemented in Java with version 1.6.0 27. The experiments are performed on a quad-core Intel r Xeon X5450 3.00GHz PC with 8GB RAM using Ubuntu 8.04.2.

Datasets. We use three real social networks as follows. 1) The dataset highschool (sampled from the dataset due to poor scalability of PRUB and the compared approach) is a friendship network for the boys in a small highschool in Illinois. 3 The nodes are boys in the highschool, and each directed edge represents a boy choosing another as a friend in questionnaires. 2) The dataset digg is a reply network of Digg. 4 Each node is a user in Digg and each directed edge stands for a user replying to another. 3) The dataset facebook is the communication network of Facebook. 5 The nodes are the users in Facebook while each directed edge rep-resents that a user posts an article on another user X  X  wall. For these datasets, the self-loops and isolated nodes are re-moved, and the edge weights are derived from the number of choices, replies, and articles of one to another, respectively. Both the degree distributions and weight distributions of all the datasets follow the well-known power law. More details are shown in the left five columns of Table 2.

Valuation Distributions. Note that there is lack of valuation information in these publicly available datasets. A na  X   X ve way is to learn the valuation information through questionnaires or historical sales data toward a specific com-modity. However, note that the valuation distributions vary with commodities. In this paper, we then explore the per-formance under different valuation distributions as follows. http://moreno.ss.uci.edu/data.html#high http://www.public.asu.edu/~mdechoud/datasets.html (The reply system has been out of service since 2012, but the data were collected in 2008.) http://socialnetworks.mpi-sws.org/data-wosn2009. html Figure 2: The comparison for maximum revenue.
 In our experiments, we implement the M-shape distribution using two Normal distributions, where the valuation of each individual follows one of the Normal distributions with equal probabilities. The parameters for generating the valuations are listed in the right three columns of Table 2.

Concave influence function. As introduced in Sec-tion 2, any non-negative, non-decreasing, and concave func-tion can be applied to the concave influence function. In our experiments, we consider the function F ( x ) = x to transform the weights into the valuation concept for simplicity.
Input prices. By considering different currencies, costs, and cultures in different countries, the pricing of a commod-ity may be different. For simplicity, we set the prices as input parameters in the experiments. For highschool , the input prices are all integers (as the unit of the dollars) in [1 , 300], due to the smaller size of the network. For digg and facebook , the input prices are all integers in [1 , 2000].
In this subsection, we first show that the consideration of a quantity constraint in the revenue maximization prob-lem makes it differ from the original problem by comparing PRUB with the previous work [11], referred to as Random-izedUSM in this paper. Due to poor scalability of PRUB and RandomizedUSM, these experiments are conducted on the small dataset highschool with Normal and M-shape val-uation distributions. In addition, note that since Random-izedUSM does not consider a quantity constraint, we derive the revenue with two kinds of post-processes as follows.
Figure 2 shows the maximum revenue reported by Ran-domizedUSM, RandomizedUSM(p), PRUB+IF and PRUB with respect to different ratios of the quantity of commodi-ties to the number of population, i.e., n | V | . Accordingly, the revenue reported by PRUB is, on average, 7.2 and 1.9 times of that obtained by RandomizedUSM and Random-izedUSM(p), respectively. Moreover, note that Randomize-dUSM has the poorest performance and even brings zero revenue at the cases of the supply ratio below 0.2. These results demonstrate that the capability of the previous ap-proach [11] (even with the post-processes) is limited for the RM w/QC problem. On the other hand, even for the special case that the quantity is not constrained, i.e., the ratio of the quantity of commodities to the number of population n/ | V | = 1, PRUB+IF still outperforms RandomizedUSM and RandomizedUSM(p). This is because PRUB+IF selects seeds in order of the pricing-sensitive importance while Ran-domizedUSM and RandomizedUSM(p) consider the seeds in arbitrary order.

On the same datasets, we then also explore the approxi-mation of PRUB+IF to PRUB (which derives the optimal solutions). According to the results in Figure 2, the per-formance of PRUB+IF is very close to that of PRUB, i.e., about 96% on average, and outperforms both Randomize-dUSM and RandomizedUSM(p). This implies that the pro-posed pricing-sensitive improtance of PRUB+IF is highly effective to identity the crucial individuals as seeds.
In this subsection, we conduct experiments on larger datasets digg and facebook to further show the performance of Algo-rithm PRUB+IF in terms of effectiveness, pricing, and effi-ciency. Here PRUB+IF is compared with two other heuris-tics PRUB+R and PRUB+SW. These two heuristics also take the PRUB approach as the framework while applying different strategies for seed selection. Specifically, PRUB+R (R standing for Random) selects seeds randomly; PRUB+SW (SW meaning Sum of the Weights) always picks up the in-dividual with the maximum sum of out-weights from those who have not yet adopted the commodity. Besides, in order to demonstrate the advantage of each part of PRUB+IF, the heuristics PRUB+N, PRUB+F, and PRUB+P represent the approaches that incorporate Normalized Weight, Feedback of Influence Propagation, and Potential-buyer Filtering, re-spectively, for seed selection.

Effectiveness. Here we use the maximum revenue ob-tained without consideration of social influences (NoSocial), i.e., the adoption of an individual only depends on his/her in-herent valuation, as the baseline, and show the effectiveness of the heuristics in ratios to the baseline. Figure 3 reports the effectiveness with respect to different ratios of the quan-tity of commodities to the number of population, i.e., n | V | For these results, we have two observations as follows. First, on digg and facebook with both Normal and M-shape valu-ation distributions, PRUB+IF is the best, and PRUB+SW outperforms PRUB+R only in the cases of small n | V | . The reason is that, to estimate the advantage of selecting an indi-vidual in the promotion, PRUB+IF introduces the pricing-sensitive importance, which considers the normalized effects of the influence propagated through the social network, while PRUB+SW only takes the sum of weights on one X  X  direct out-neighbors. RRUB+R picks the seeds blindly. Second, as | V | decreases, the performance of PRUB+IF becomes even more noticeable (compared to PRUB+SW and PRUB+R).
 This is because the number of potential buyers reduces when the pricing of the commodity increases due to scarcity. The less the number of potential buyers is, the more challenging the seed selection is. Hence, the results demonstrate that the strategy of PRUB+IF for the seed selection outperforms those of PRUB+SW and PRUB+R.

Pricing. In addition to the demonstration of effectiveness by maximum revenue, whether or not the suggested pricing complies with the common sense is also an interesting ques-tion. For answering this question, we plotted the trend of the pricing suggested by PRUB+IF, PRUB+SW, PRUB+R, and NoSocial with respect to different ratios of the quan-tity of commodities to the number of population, i.e., n | V | in Figure 4. Accordingly, PRUB+IF suggests higher pric-ing in most cases than the other approaches to gain higher maximum revenue (as shown in Figure 3) in all cases. This implies that PRUB+IF performs the most elegant strategy for seed selection. The smart utilization of word-of-mouth effects can help the promotion of commodities in higher pric-ing, which complies with the common sense. Furthermore, for all methods, there is an upward trend in the pricing as | V | decreases. The less the quantity is, the more precious the commodity could be, which also complies with the com-mon sense. There are some exceptions to this pricing trend: PRUB+IF at 0.25 on digg (M), and both PRUB+SW and PRUB+R at 0.25 or 0.3 on facebook (N). The reason is that a quantity of supply is used as freebies. This may allow higher pricing in some cases by leaving less quantities for sale. The tiny example in Figure 5 explains such a case in more de-tails. ( F ( x ) = x is used as the concave influence function.) For the case of the quantity of the concert tickets as 2, the maximum revenue is R (2 , $3 ,  X  ) = $6 (i.e., b and c adopt the concert tickets). Now consider that the quantity of the concert tickets is increased to 3. The maximum revenue is R (3 , $7 , { a,c } ) = $7 (i.e., b adopts the concert ticket under the impact of a and c ). The pricing is higher even though the quantity increases. This is because 2 out of 3 concert tickets are used as free tickets and only 1 concert ticket is left for sale. Hence, according to these results, PRUB+IF is capable of suggesting elegant marketing strategies.
Efficiency. Now we compare the efficiency of the three heuristics. Figure 6 shows the runtime with respect to dif-ferent ratios of the quantity of commodities to the number of population, i.e., n | V | , on digg (N), digg (M), facebook (N), and facebook (M). PRUB+IF spends more execution time than PRUB+SW and PRUB+R in all cases, since PRUB+IF con-siders the influence propagation in the derivation of pricing-sensitive importance for seed selection. PRUB+R generally spends a little bit more time than PRUB+SW due to the blind seed selection (that makes PRUB+R need to search Figure 5: An example for the exception to the pric-ing trend. more prices for finding maximum revenue). Nevertheless, the runtime of all the three heuristics is not sensitive to For PRUB+IF, other factors such as the local structure of potential buyers and the influence cascades will also affect the runtime.
Influence Maximization. The influence maximization problem aims at identifying a group of seeds so that the number of the active people is the largest [2, 3, 9, 12]. To the best of our knowledge, the first study could be traced to the work [3], where Domingos et al. studied the influence maximization problem as an algorithmic problem. Then, Kempe et al. [9] formally modeled the problem as a discrete optimization, which is to identify k seeds for maximizing the influence spread over the social network. Meanwhile, Kempe et al. also showed that the influence maximization problem is NP-hard under both the Linear Threshold (LT) and the Independent Cascade (IC) models, and proposed a greedy strategy with approximation guarantees. Specifically, in the LT model, the influences on an individual are cumulative, and each individual has his/her own activation threshold. An individual becomes active if the sum of weights from his/her active neighbors is larger than or equal to his/her activation threshold. Then, this active individual will also propagate influences to his/her inactive neighbors. In the IC model, each influence an individual receives is indepen-dent. For each influence, there is one and only one chance to activate the individual with a probability. If the individual becomes active, he/she futher spreads his/her influence in the same mannar. In the work [2], Chen et al. showed that, given seeds, computing the influence spread under the LT model is #P-hard, and provided a scalable heuristic based on the fast computation for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Singer [12] concerned the inherent costs of making individ-uals as seeds and followed the incentive compatible mecha-nism to extract the true information about individuals X  costs for identifying and rewarding the seeds. As mentioned in Section 1, all these influence maximization problems do not take the monetary effects on people X  X  purchase decisions into account, and thus differ from our problem.

Revenue Maximization. The problem of revenue max-imization is to derive the marketing strategy that brings the optimal revenue under the social influence, and was first ad-dressed by Hartline et al. [6]. As a solution, Hartline et al. [6] proposed a marketing strategy, named influence-and-exploit (IE), to tackle the problem in two steps. In the influence step, IE identifies a group of customers as seeds. After that, in the exploit step, IE visits the remaining customers in a random order and offers each of them the optimal (myopic) pricing of the product in order to maximize the revenue. The decision whether or not an individual purchases the product depends on the pricing offered and the individual X  X  valua-tion, which takes the social influences into consideration. Hartline et al. [6] also discussed the inferences of the val-uations from social influences by Uniform Additive Model, Symmetric Model, and Concave Graph Model. Later, Fo-takis et al. [5] proposed a polynomial-time approach to ap-proximate the maximum revenue in the Uniform Additive Model. Another work [10] distinguishes between activation and adoption. When an individual is active by the social in-fluence, he/she will then determine whether or not to adopt the product with respect to the pricing and his/her valua-tion. The marketing strategy of all these works is to deter-mine customized pricing for different customers.

Mirrokni et al. [11] argued that offering the product at fixed pricing is more reasonable since offering customized pricing is hard to implement in the real world. Hence, their objective is to discover a seed group with the fixed pricing to maximize the revenue. Mirrokni et al. [11] adopted the Concave Graph Model proposed in the work [6] to incorpo-rate the social influence into the valuation, and presented a (1/2)-approximation based on the randomized linear time approximation algorithm for the Unconstrained Submodular Maximization problem.

However, all the works above assumed that there is an unlimited supply of commodities, whereas we consider the scenario with limited supply such as limited edition com-modities and concert tickets. As shown in Sections 1 and 4.1, it is unapplicable for these works to determine the proper marketing strategies.
In this work, we addressed the revenue maximization prob-lem with a quantity constraint on a monetizing social net-work. To maximize the revenue, the marketing strategy is to determine the pricing of the commodity and find a seed group of individuals as the initial customers. Hence, we pro-vided Algorithm PRUB to derive the pricing and the seed group for the optimal revenue. For better efficiency, we fur-ther proposed Algorithm PRUB+IF as a heuristic algorithm based on the framework of PRUB for a feasible solution. The experiments on real datasets with different valuation distri-butions showed the effectiveness of PRUB and PRUB+IF.
