 1. Introduction
The dynamic economic dispatch is one of the most important optimization problems in the power system operation, which is referred to determine the combination of power outputs of all generating units over a dispatch horizon so as to minimize the total fuel cost, while satisfying various physical and operational con-straints. As a more accurate formulation of the traditional static economicloaddispatch(ELD)problem,DEDtakestherampratelimits which keep the thermal gradients of the generating units within a safe area into consideration to assur e the exact satisfaction of technical constraints on the dynamics of power generation. Traditionally, the fuel cost function for each generating unit is represented approxi-mately as a quadratic function, while ignoring the valve-point effects, whichwouldleadaninaccuracytothed ispatchresultoftheoperation in reality. Mathematically, the DED problem with valve-point effects can be categorized as a dynamicnonlinear optimization problemwith non-smooth and non-convex characteristics subjected to various equality and inequality constraints, which makes finding the optimal dispatch result with an efficiency a challenge.

Many traditional methods have been proposed to solve DED problem in the past decades. The traditional mathematical meth-ods include linear programming (LP) ( Jabr et al., 2000 ), non-linear programming (NLP) ( Chen, 2007; Takriti and Krasenbrink, 1999 ), quadratic programming (QP) ( Papageorgiou and Fraga, 2007 ), Lagrange relaxation (LR) ( Hindi and Ghani, 1991; Keib et al., 1994 ) and dynamic programming (DP) ( Travers and Kaye, 1998 ). However, most of these methods have difficulties in finding the optimal solution, due to their shortcomings in terms of problem formulation, solution accuracy and computation efficiency. For an LP, the nonlinear and non-smooth characteristics of the DED problem are often ignored for the linearization of model, which may generate large errors to the final dispatch result. For the effective implementation of NLP and QP, the objective function needs to be continuous and differentiable. Thus, some approxima-tions of formulation are needed when NLP and QP are applied to solve the DED problem, which may lead an inaccuracy to the final solution. The successful application of an LR depends on the Lagrange multipliers updating strategy, and it suffers from the oscillation of the solution. DP imposes no restrictions on the nature of non-smooth and non-convex of the DED problem with valve-point effects. However, if the scale of the power system is large, DE may result in the  X  X  X urse of the dimensionality X  X .
Many modern heuristics stochastic search algorithm such as genetic algorithm (GA) ( Baskar et al., 2003; Chiang, 2005 ), evolu-tionary programming (EP) ( Jayabarathi et al., 2005 ), simulated annealing (SA) ( Wong and Fong, 1993 ), particle swam optimization (PSO) ( Cai et al., 2007; Yuan et al., 2009 ) and differential evolution algorithm (DE) ( Yuan et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2009 ) have been implemented preciously to solve the DED problem with no restriction on the non-smooth and non-convex characteristics of the problem. However, all those methods mentioned above do not guarantee obtaining the global optimal solution in finite computational time, due to their drawbacks. GA suffers from the premature convergence, and the encoding and decoding strategies adopted by GA makes it to take long computational time to convergence. Only a reasonable solution which is near the global optimal, one would be provided occasionally with a slow conver-gence rate when an EP is applied to solve the DED problem. The fine tuning procedure for the control parameters of the annealing schedule of an SA requires multiple runs, which would degrade the computation efficiency of the algorithm remarkably. For PSO andDE,theprematureconvergencemaytrapthealgorithmintothe local optimum, which may reduce their optimization ability, when applied to solve the DED problem.

In this respect, hybrid methods which consisted of two or more algorithms may prove to be efficient in solving the DED problem.
Most of those hybrid methods combine stochastic heuristics algorithm and deterministic methods to try to obtain the final optimal solution. Basically, those hybrid methods employ stochas-tic heuristics algorithm to perform the global search to obtain a near global optimal solution, and then uses deterministic methods to fine tune the obtained near global optimal solution to locate the global optimal solution. Hybrid methods combining EP and PSO withsequentialquadraticprogramming(SQP)( Pathometal.,2002;
Victoire and Jeyakumar, 2005; Aruldoss et al., 2004 ) have been developed successfully for solving the DED problem. However, those hybrid methods still have drawbacks. Choosing suitable parameter values is difficult for those hybrid methods mentioned above, which is always a problem-dependent task. Moreover another main disadvantage for those hybrid methods for solving theDED problemistheirslowconvergenceto thefinalresultforthe large amount of procedural iterations. In reference Coelho and
Mariani (2006) , a method which is combined of chaotic differential evolution and quadratic programming is proposed by Coelho to solve an economic dispatch problem (ED) and satisfied results are obtained. However, the problem formulation in reference Coelho and Mariani (2006) is relatively simple by solving static economic load dispatch problem in single dispatch period, while neglecting the constraints of increase and decrease rate of the outputs of all generating units and the dynamic connections among the system parameters during the dispatch periods. Thus, the improvement of current optimization algorithm and the exploration of new tech-niques for solving the DED problem have great significance.
Differential evolution algorithm (DE) ( Storn and Price, 1995 ), which is proposed by Price and Storn, is a population based evolutionary algorithm with the representation of floating-point chromosomes.Comparedwithotherevolutionaryalgorithms,DEis a simple yet powerful optimizer with fewer parameters, which is highly efficient in solving optimization problems with non-smooth and non-convex characteristics for not requiring derivative infor-mation. Thus, DE has been applied successfully to various fields of power system optimization problem in the past few years, causing widespread concern among scholars ( Travers and Kaye, 1998;
Varadarajan and Swarup, 2008 ). However, DE still has some drawbacks. The successful application of traditional DE mainly depends on its parameter settings. However, the parameters of the canonical version of DE are constant throughout the entire search process. Hence, it is difficult to choose suitable values of control parameters in DE without the fine tuning progress. Moreover DE often suffers the problem of premature convergence, which may lead the searching progressintolocal optimaland reduce the global optimization ability of DE significantly.At the same time, DE lacks a mechanism to deal with the complicated constraints of the DED problem. Recently, several successful applications of DE combined with chaotic sequences in optimization problems have been reported in the literatures ( Yuan et al., 2008; Coelho, 2009;
Coelho et al., 2009 ). However, it seems that all those chaotic DE methods mainly focus on the parameter control strategy based on chaotic sequences, and the combination of chaotic local search and
DE to improve the convergence properties is rare in those researches. Meanwhile, those chaotic differential evolution researches seem to lack a comprehensive analysis on how does the dynamic parameter setting strategy as well as the chaotic local search (CLS) influence the efficiency and convergence properties of
DE. Moreover those chaotic DE methods still lack a strategy to deal with the constraints of complicated optimization problem like
DED. Therefore, this paper proposes three chaotic differential evolution (CDE) algorithms to solve the DED problem. The research of this paper is mainly focusing on two issues: first, a comprehen-sive study on DE combining with chaotic sequences is implemen-ted. A dynamic parameter control mechanism based on chaotic sequences is applied by the proposed CDE methods to determine the parameter settings adaptively. Meanwhile, a chaotic local search (CLS) operator is integrated to avoid the premature con-vergence of DE effectively. Second, in order to handle the compli-cated constraintsof the DED problem with efficiency, new heuristic constraints handling methods and feasibility based selection strategy are designed and embedded into the proposed methods for dealing with the inequality and equality constraints of the DED problem effectively. Finally, the proposed methods are applied to solve the DED problem of two test systems. The simulation and dispatch result analyses reveal that, the proposed CDE methods can obtain global optimal solution in a shorter computational time along with higher effectiveness and better convergence properties compared to those of other methods reported in recent literatures. tion is introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, we briefly describe the
DE scheme on which the proposed methods are based on. After-wards, in Section 4, we mentioned the framework of the proposed
CDE methods. Section 5 presents the proposed CDE methods for solving the DED problem in details. Section 6, through simulations, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Section 7 outlines the conclusions followed by acknowledgements. 2. Problem formulation fuel cost as much as possible by determining the optimal combina-tions of output of all generating units over the dispatch periods, while satisfying all kinds of physical and operational constraints. Generally, the objective function and associated constraints of the
DED problem can be formulated as follows. 2.1. Objective function the given dispatch horizon as follows: min F  X  number of generating units; T is the number of intervals over the dispatch horizon. Traditionally, the fuel cost function of each unit is described as a quadratic function, which can be represented as follows: where a i , b i , c i are cost coefficients of the i-th unit. cost curve, due to the wire drawing effects when steam admission valve starts to open, which is named as valve-point effects. In order to model the DED problem with the consideration of valve-point effects more accurately, the objective function of the problem is described as a superposition of quadratic and sinusoidal functions, which would increase the non-smoothness and local optimal points of the solution space. The cost function with valve-point effects can be represented as f  X  P where e i and h i are the valve-point effects coefficients of the i-th unit; P i, min is the minimum output limit of the i-th unit; 2.2. Constraints
The DED problem with valve-point effects is subjected to the following equality and inequality constraints: (1) Real power balance where P D,t istheloaddemandatthe t -thdispatchinterval; P the power loss at the t -th dispatch interval, which can be calculated by using the B loss coefficients matrix in the quadratic form as follows: P where B , B 0 and B 00 are the power loss coefficients. (2) Output capacity limits
P where P i ,min , P i ,max are the minimum and maximum output limits of the i -th unit. (3) Generating unit ramp rate limits ( where UR i and DR i are the maximum output ramp up rate limit and the maximum output ramp down rate limit of the i -th unit, respectively. 3. Overview of differential evolution algorithm
Differential evolution algorithm (DE) is a simple and powerful population-based stochastic optimization algorithm, which is origin-ally motivated by the mechanisms of natural selection. Since it does not require the derivative information, DE is very effective for solving optimization problems with non-smooth and non-convex character-istics. This technique combines s imple arithmetic operator with classic evolutionary operators , such as mutation, crossover and selection. The key idea behind DE is a scheme for generating trial vectors. Mutation is used to generate a mutant vector by adding differential vectors obtained from t he difference of several randomly chosen parametervectors to theparentvector.After that,atrial vector is produced by a crossover through recombining the obtained mutant vector with the target vector. Final ly, according to the fitness value, selection determines which of the vectors will be chosen for the next generation by implementing one-to-one competition between the new generated trial vectors and their corresponding parents.
The population of DE contains NP D -dimensions real-valued parameter vectors for each generation named as X i , g  X  ( x y , x iD , g ), ( i  X  1, 2, y , NP ), where i and g denote the index of individual and the number of generation, respectively. According to Storn and Price, the strategy of DE can be described as follows. 3.1. Mutation
DE is integrated with a relatively simple and efficient form of self-adaptive mutation operator. Several alternative strategies for mutation operation have been proposed in reference Storn and Price (1995) .The mutation strategy implemented in this paper was DE/ rand / 1 / bin .For each parameter vector X i,g in the population, a corresponding mutant V where integers r 1 , r 2 and r 3 are generated randomly in the range of [1, NP ], which are mutually different. The mutation parameter F is a real, constant, user-supplied parameter, which controls the amplification of the differential variation. 3.2. Crossover
DE implements crossover operation to increase the diversity of the population. A trail vector (called as U i,g , U i , g  X  ( u generated by discrete recombination of the parent X i,g and its corresponding mutant vector V i,g using the following scheme: u i  X  1 , 2 , ... , NP ; j  X  1 , 2 , ... , D  X  9  X  where Rand ( j )isthe j-th evaluation of a uniform random number generatorbetween[0,1]. Rnd ( i ) is arandomlychosen indexwithin the range of [1, D ], which ensures U i,g gets at least one element from V Otherwise, the population may not evolve for there is no new generatedsolution.And CR whichvaluebetween[0,1]isthecrossover parameter, which controls the recombination. 3.3. Selection
The Greedy selection scheme is adopted in DE. A one-to-one competition is implemented between the parent X i,g and its corresponding trail vector U i,g . According to the value of fitness, thebetteronewillbeselectedforthenextgeneration.Theselection operation can be expressed as X i  X  1 , 2 , ... , NP  X  10  X  4. Chaotic differential evolution (CDE) methods
Inthissection,theframeworksoftheproposedCDEmethodsare introduced. Recently, some successful applications of an EA combined with chaotic sequences in optimization problems have been reported in literatures ( Caponetto and Fortuna, 2003 ). The simulationresults reveal that some chaotic sequencesapplied in an EA are always able to increase the exploitation capability of the algorithm in the search space and enhance its convergence property because of the ergodicity, stochastic properties and irregularity of the chaotic optimization methods. Hence, the concepts of chaotic optimization would be useful for enhancing the optimization ability of DE. As other evolutionary algorithms, the success application of DE mainly depends on the value settings of the control parameters and the strategy for avoiding premature convergence. Thus, in the proposed methods, we mainly focus on these two issues.
 4.1. CDE method 1
The performance of DE is significantly influenced by the value setting of control parameters, F and CR . Proper value setting of parameters is important for the successful application of the DE algorithm. However, as a problem-dependent task, choosing suitable parameter values is difficult for DE. The traditionalmethod used for the optimal parameter value setting for a specific problem is the trial-and-tuning method, which would usually require high computational time, due to the multiple runs for parameter setting optimization. Moreover as mentioned in the literature ( Yuan et al., 2008 ),thetraditionalconstantparametersettingcannotensurethe optimization X  X  ergodicity completely in the search phase. There-fore, a dynamic parameter control mechanism based on chaotic sequences for adjusting the parameter value settings of DE adaptively during the searching progress is presented in this paper.
The utilization of chaotic sequences to adjust the parameter value settings of DE adaptively has two advantages: first, since no trial-and-tuning process is needed, the extra computational time required for the fine-tuning process of parameter settings can be saved so as to improve the optimization efficiency. Second, the diversity ofthe populationcan beimprovedsince the valuesettings are adjusted adaptively instead of being constant, which could enhance the convergence properties of the algorithm.

The dynamic parameter control mechanism, we design for adjusting the values of F and CR dynamically, is based on the
Tent equation ( Tavazoeia and Haeri,2007 ), whichis a famous chaos system. The Tent equation can be described as follows: cx i  X  1 , 2 , ... , D ; k  X  1 , 2 , ... , k max  X  11  X  where k represents the iteration number, k max denotes the max-imum iteration for chaotic sequences, cx i k denotes the i -th chaotic variable and its value is typically between [0, 1]. From Eq. (11) we know that, during the iterations of the Tent equation, the value of cx k will be distributed between [0, 1] under the condition that the initial cx i 0 A (0, 1) and cx i 0 e {1/4, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4}.
This paper proposes a Tent equation based dynamic parameter control mechanism for obtaining the value settings of parameters
CR and F to improve the computational efficiency of DE. The value setting of parameter F of Eq. (8) in the proposed CDE method 1 is adjusted dynamically by Eq. (12) through the following expresses:
F A  X  0 , 1  X  , F 0 = 2f 1 = 4 , 1 = 2 , 2 = 3 , 3 = 4 g g  X  1 , 2 , ... , g max  X  12  X 
Similar to the rule for adjusting the value of parameter F , the parameter CR of Eq. (9) in the proposed CDE method 1 is updated adaptively by Eq. (13) as
CR 0 A  X  0 , 1  X  , CR 0 = 2f 1 = 4 , 1 = 2 , 2 = 3 , 3 = 4 g g  X  1 , 2 , ... , g max  X  13  X  4.2. CDE method 2
As mentioned in Section 3.3, the Greedy selection strategy is adopted in DE to choose the offspring for the next generation. Thus, in DE, the fitness value of a new generated offspring competes one-to-one to that of its corresponding parent, which may give a rise of a fast convergence rate. However, this fast convergence rate may decrease the population diversity rapidly during the searching progress and lead to a higher probability of obtaining a local optimum. As a result, only a reasonable solution which is near the globaloptimalonewouldbe providedbyDE inthefinitesimulation time. Recently, some simulation results reveal that chaotic local search (CLS) is always able to increase the exploitation capability of the algorithm in the search space and enhance its convergence property ( Tavazoeia and Haeri, 2007 ). The CLS has some advan-tages, which may help DE to avoid premature convergence effectively. Therefore, the proposed CDE method 2 combines DE and a chaotic local search operator for solving the DED problem.
Basically, the hybrid method employs DE to perform the global search, and then uses CLS operator to search locally to locate the global optimal solution.
 based on the Tent equation which is described in Eq. (11), the procedures of CLS based on the Tent equation for solving the DED problem are as follows: 4.3. CDE method 3 mentioned above, which adopts the dynamic parameter control mechanism based on chaotic sequences and the CLS operation based on the Tent equation simultaneously to improve the optimization ability and convergence property of DE for solving the DED problem.
 5. Implementation of CDE methods for dynamic economic dispatch with valve-points effects
In this section, the procedures of the proposed CDE methods for solving the DED problem with valve-point effects are described in details. Asother evolutionaryalgorithms,the successapplication of the proposed methods mainly depends on the mechanism for constraints handling. Thus, in the proposed method, we mainly focus on this issue. 5.1. Structure of solutions
In order to handle the constraints conveniently, the structure of solutions for solving the DED problem adopted by the proposed methods is composed of a set of power outputs as the decision variables. For T intervals over the schedule horizon, there are T schedulesofpoweroutputsby N generatingunits.Thus,thearrayof decision variable vector represented for a solution of the DED problem is as follows: P  X  ^^^^ 2 6 6 6 6 4 where P i,t is the output of the i -th generating unit at the t -th dispatch interval, which is subjected to the real power output limit constraint (6). 5.2. Initialization of the population
In this procedure, NP solutions will be created randomly to initialize the population. For all solutions in the initial population, each element is generated at random within the feasible power output range to the constraint (6). An element of a solution is initialized as follows:
P where U (0, 1) is a random generated number between 0 and 1, which obeys uniform distribution. 5.3. Constraint handling method for power output limit
Inthissection,wemainlyfocusonhandlingthepoweroutputlimit (6) when the proposed CDE methods are applied to solve the DED problem. After mutation or CLS oper ation has been implemented, the new generated individual may violate the inequality constraint (6).
Hence, the following procedure is adopted by the proposed methods to modify the value of the new generated element, which is outside the feasible boundaries to satisfy constraint (6)
P  X  i  X  1 , 2 , ... , N ; t  X  1 , 2 , ... , T  X  18  X  where P t i , min and P t i , max aretheminimumandmaximumoutputlimits of the i -th unit during the t -thdispatchinterval. 5.4. Constraint handling method for real power balance and generating unit ramp rate limits
In this section, we mainly focus on how to handle the real power balance constraint (4) and generating unit ramp rate limits constraint (7) with efficiency. When population initialization, crossover or CLS operation has been implemented, the new generated individuals may most popular strategy for dealing with these constraints of the DED problem. Basically, the fundamental strategy of the penalty method is to convert a constrained problem into an unconstrained one. By using the penalty functions, the infeasible individuals are punished with the amount of its constraint violations, so that the priorities of the feasible ones can be ensured during the selection operation. Despite the popularity of penalty functions, they still have several drawbacks: first, the formulation of the penalty function should be carefully determined for evolutionary algorithms (EA) in any particular applica-tion, and several researches had mentioned that the efficiency of the penalty method is sensitive to the formulation of the penalty function. Thus, a parallel algorithm may be needed for the determination of the formulation of penalty function ( Coello, 2002 ). Second, the penalty factors require a carefully fine tuning progress to accurately estimate the degree of penalization. Both of those above mentioned drawbacks of the penalty method require extra computational resources and may degrade the efficiency of the algorithm remarkably. In order to handle the real power balance constraint (4) and generating unit ramp rate limits constraint (7) of the DED problem effectively without degrading the computation efficiency of the proposed CDE methods, the follow-ing heuristic procedures are designed in this paper for all NP solutions in the population to resolve those constraints mentioned above: Step 1 : set t  X  1, where t denotes the dispatch interval index.
Step 2 : the amount of load balance constraint violation at the t -th dispatch interval P Diff , t is calculated from Eq. (19) as
Step3 :if P Diff , t  X  0,thengotoStep13;if P Diff , t 4 PdVioLmt ,thengo to Step 4; Otherwise go to Step 9, where PdVioLmt is a user-supplied parameter for deciding the coarse tuning operation or the fine tuning operation is implemented.

Step 4 : set l pcoa  X  0, where l pcoa denotes the iteration number of the coarse adjusting operation.

Step 5: the value of an average load balance constraint violation at the t -thdispatch interval P AvgDiff , t iscalculated fromEq. (20) as
Step 6: modify the power outputs of all generating units at the t -th dispatch interval by Eq. (21) as
If the modified P i , t does not violate power output limit (6), then go to Step 7; otherwise, the value of P i , t is modified by Eq. (18) and then go to Step 7.
 if P Diff , t o PdVioLmt , then go to Step 9; otherwise go to Step 8. maximumiterationnumberforcoarseadjustingoperation,then go to Step 5; otherwise go to Step 9.

Step 9: set the iteration number of the fine adjusting operation
Step10: calculate P Diff , t byEq.(19),if P Diff , t  X  0,thengotoStep13; otherwise go to Step 11.

Step 11: choose a unit r randomly, modify the power output of the chosen unit P r,t by
If the modified P r,t does not violate power output limit (6), then go to Step 12; otherwise, the value of P r,t is modified by Eq. (18) and then go to Step 12.
 maximum iteration number for the fine adjusting operation, then go to Step 10; otherwise go to Step 13.

Step 13: t  X  t +1,if t o T , Eq. (23) is applied to modify the power output limits of the next dispatch interval by integrating the dispatch results during this dispatch interval along with the generatingunitrampratelimitsconstraint(7),thengotoStep2; otherwise the termination of the procedure is done.
 8 &lt; : 5.5. Selection strategy considering constraints violation
In the real simulation phase, we noticed that the new generated individuals may not guarantee to satisfy the equality constraint (4) after the implementation of constraints handling methods. Though those infeasible individuals could be eliminated by increasing the iteration number of constraint handling methods mentioned above, the computational efficiency will degrade remarkably when too much computation resources are spent on dealing with those constraints. Therefore, in order to strike a balance between com-putational efficiency and constraints handling, the following selec-tion strategy is adopted by the proposed CDE methods with the considerationofconstraintsviolationduringtheselectionoperation i. If solution X 1 is feasible and solution X 2 is infeasible, then X ii. If both X 1 and X 2 are feasible, the one with the smaller total fuel iii. If both X 1 and X 2 are infeasible, then the one with the smaller 5.6. Procedures of CDE methods for dynamic economic dispatch with valve-points effects
Step 1: initialize the individuals of the population randomly by using Eq. (17), and set the generation number g  X  0. Considering that the new generated individuals may violate the constraints, constraints handling methods should be implemented to force them satisfy all constraints.

Step 2: evaluate all the individuals of the population, and the best solution obtaineduntil the current generation g will be set as Xbst .
 Step 3: if CDE method 2 or CDE method 3 is implemented, the
CLS operation which is introduced in Section 4.2 will be executed based on Xbst g .

Step 4: if CDE method 1 or CDE method 3 is implemented, the value of F is calculated according to Eq. (12), and then execute the mutation operation according to Eq. (24); otherwise, the mutationoperation isimplementedaccording toEq. (8) without any adjusting procedure.

Step 5: if CDE method 1 or CDE method 3 is implemented, the value of CR is calculated according to Eq. (13), and then implement the crossover operation according to Eq. (25); other-wise, the crossover operation is invoked according to Eq. (9). 6. Case study 6.1. Description of the test systems system with non-smooth valve-point effects cost function are studied to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed CDE methods for solving the DED problem.

The dispatch horizon is chosen as one day with 24 dispatch intervals of each one hour, and the power demands during the whole dispatch periods and coefficient data of the generating units are listed in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. unit system mentioned above into a 30-unit large-scale power system. 6.2. Parameter settings for simulation
P-IV 2.4 Hz personal computer to solve DED problems of those test systems mentioned above. Meanwhile, in order to verify effective-nessofthemodificationworksintroducedinthispaper,theoriginal version of DE is also implemented to solve the same problems.
WhendifferentversionsofDEareimplemented,theparametersare listed in Table 3 . 6.3. Computation results and comparison methods and the original version of DE were implemented to solve
DED problems of those two test systems mentioned above 20 times from different initial populations which consist of 60 solutions to verify modification work introduced in this paper, and the best dispatch result during these 20 independent simulations was selected as the final optimal result. Meanwhile, in order to verify effectiveness of the proposed methods introduced in this paper for solving the DED problem with value-point effects, the same problems were solved by an EP, hybrid EP with SQP (EP-SQP) and modified hybrid EP with SQP (MHEP-SQP), whose dispatch results were reported in references Pathom et al. (2002) and Victoire and Jeyakumar (2005) .
 6.3.1. Test system 1
A comparison study is implemented for solving the DED problem of this test system by comparing the dispatch result and the convergence performance of the proposed CDE methods and those of DE, EP, EP-SQP and MHEP-SQP directly. Table 4 gives the best total fuel cost, average total fuel cost and the average CPU execution time of the proposed CDE methods and original DE to verify modification work introduced in this paper, and the corre-sponding convergence property comparisons are shown in Fig. 1 , and the convergence process of an average total fuel cost obtained by different versions of DE during 20 simulations for test system 1 are shown in Fig. 2 . The details of the best dispatch result obtained bythe proposedCDEmethodsare given in Table 5 to checkwhether the constraints of the problem are satisfied or not. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of total fuel cost of the best dispatch result of 20 independent simulations by applying CDE methods to solve the
DED problem of this test system. Finally, in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed CDE methods for solving the DED problem with value-point effects, the dispatch results of those EP,
EP-SQP and MHEP-SQP which are reported in references Pathom et al. (2002) and Victoire and Jeyakumar (2005) are also summar-ized in Table 4 for the convenience of comparisons.

From Table 4, it can be seen clearly that the proposed CDE methods can get better dispatch results than the original DE method and EP, EP-SQP as well as MHEP-SQP methods proposed in recent literatures. The best total fuel cost over the dispatch horizon obtained by the proposed CDE methods among these 20 dependent simulations for solving the DED problem of this test system is 1,019,123 $. Moreover from Table 4, it is clear that the proposedCDEmethod1 andCDEmethod2 as wellas CDEmethod3 can obtain lower total fuel cost than the DE method in this test system, thus resulting in higher quality solutions. At the same time, as can be seen in Table 4 , the proposed CDE methods especially CDE methods3 can get better average total fuel cost thanthe originalDE method, and they can get lower worst total fuel cost than other comparative methods too. Thus, the high efficiency of the proposed methods is verified again. From Fig. 1, it is clearly seen that the total fuel cost value obtained by the proposed methods declines sharply at the beginning of procedure, while decreasing slowly at later stages and the same phenomenon can be seen in Fig. 2 too. From
Fig. 2, we can see that the proposed CDE methods especially CDE method 3 can reach the optimal solution much more quickly than DE, thus verifying the good convergence property of the proposed
CDE methods. Moreover from Table 4 and Fig. 1 as well as Fig. 2 , we may come to the following conclusions about the modification work in this paper: first, by increasing the diversification of the population in a quite simple way, the dynamic parameter control mechanism based on chaotic sequences adopted in the proposed CDE methods can improve the convergence property and solutionquality of DE, whilecosting almost no extra computational time; second, though requiring a little extra computational resources for implementation, the Tent Map based CLS designed in this paper can enhance the globe optimization ability of DE significantly and avoid premature convergence effectively by using the ergodicity, stochastic properties and irregularity of the chaotic optimization methods to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm.
 tionsforall units.Fromthe analysisofthe dispatchresultin Table5 , it can be clearly seen that the dispatch results obtained by the proposed CDE methods satisfy all kinds of complicated constraints of DED problem, including real power balance Eq. (4) and generat-ing unit ramp rate limit (7), while reducing the total fuel cost effectively. Thus, it can be easily concluded that the constraints handling methods and the feasibility based selection strategy introduced in this paper can deal with the complicated constraints of the DED problem effectively without intervening the dynamic process inherent in the proposed CDE methods.
 independent simulations for solving the DED problem of this test system using the proposed CDE methods are inspected to check the quality of the obtaineddispatch results. From Fig. 3 , it can be seen that the variation ranges of the total fuel cost of the best dispatch result obtained by the proposed CDE methods from each independent simulation are relatively small, and all these total fuel cost values are equally distributed between the minimum and the maximum values without any bias, thus demonstrating the robustness of the proposed CDE methods for solving the DED problem.
 Finally, from Table 4 , it can be clearly seen that the proposed
CDE methods can reduce the total fuel cost more significantly compared to the established methods when applied to solve the
DED problem of this test system. Moreover it also can be seen in tablethattheaverageCPUexecutiontimerequiredbytheproposed
CDE methods for solving the DED problem of this test system is less compared to those methods mentioned above, it is obvious that the proposed CDE methods are superior compared to the other methods mentioned above. 6.3.2. Test system 2
This test system is obtained by tripling the 10-unit test system 1 into a 30-unit large-scale power system. Thus, the non-convex, non-smooth and nonlinear characteristics of the solution space are enormously increased. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed CDE methods for solving the DED problem of large-scale power system and the modification work introduced in this paper, the proposed CDE methods and the original DE were applied to solve the DED problem of this test system 20 times from different initial populations which consist of 75 solutions with the para-average total fuel cost and the average CPU execution time of the proposed CDE methods and an original DE to verify the modifica-tion work introduced in this paper, and the corresponding con-vergence property comparisons are shown in Fig. 4 . Moreover this test system is studied to directly compare the dispatch results and performances of the proposed CDE methods with those established EP-SQP, EP-SQP and MHEP-SQP methods reported in reference
Victoire and Jeyakumar (2005) . For the convenience of compar-isons,the dispatch results of themethods mentionedaboveare also summarized in Table 6 .

The optimal total fuel cost of the dispatch results in this test system, obtained by the proposed CDE methods, during the 20 dependent simulations is 3,083,930 $. It can be seen that the proposed CDE methods can obtain lower best total fuel cost and average total fuel cost than the original DE method. Moreover it is obvious that the performance of the proposed CDE methods for solving the DED problem of this test system is better compared to the original version of CDE. Meanwhile, as can be seen in Fig. 4 , the proposed CDE methods, especially CDE method 3, can avoid being trapped into local optimal area effectively and have better convergence property than that of DE. Thus, the effectiveness of the modification work introduced in this paper is verified.
Finally, from Table 6 , it is clearly seen that the proposed CDE methods can provide better dispatch result in a shorter computa-tional time for solving the DED problem of this test system than the established methods reported in the reference Victoire and Jeyakumar (2005) . Thus, the successful application of the proposed CDE methods for solving the DED problem of the large-scale power system with the consideration of valve-point effect is well demonstrated. 7. Conclusions
This paper introduces three novel chaotic differential evolution methods for solving the DED problem with valve-point effects. The significant modifications are mainly focused on preventing pre-mature convergence of DE and the constraints handling methods for dealing with the complicated constraints of the DED problem. The proposed methods adopt a new dynamic parameter control mechanism based on Tent chaotic sequences to adjust the para-meter values of DE adaptively. Meanwhile, in order to avoid the premature convergence of DE, a Tent Map based chaotic local search (CLS) operator is integrated into the proposed methods to improve the convergence properties of the algorithm. Moreover new heuristic constraints handling methods, which do not require penalty factors, are applied to deal with the inequality and equality constraints of the DED problem effectively. Additionally, feasibility based selection strategy are embedded into the proposed methods to guide the population to the feasible region quickly.
Two testsystemsaresolvedbyusingtheproposedCDEmethods and the dispatch results are compared directly with those of the other techniques reported in the recent literatures. The proposed methods can obtain better dispatch results within a shorter computational time than the other techniques. The simulation results prove the superiority of the proposed methods regarding both the convergence properties and computational efficiency.
