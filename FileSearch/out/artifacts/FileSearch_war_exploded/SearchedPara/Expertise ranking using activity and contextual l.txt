 1. Introduction
The collaboration landscape has changed fundamentally in the last few years by allowing users to shape the Web and avail-knowledge in forums, write Wiki pages, and utilize social-services to stay in touch with other people. Crowdsourcing [1 to a new Web-based collaboration model where tasks are outsourced by, for example, companies to an anonymous workforce.
Task-based crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) [4] enable businesses to access the manpower cific collaboration network as important peers. Our model is based on two essential steps:  X  ed interaction graph upon which mining and ranking is performed.  X 
Context-aware ranking. We extend the PageRank model [8] by introducing various metrics that may be associated with a par-interactions between people may have varying relevancy for different contexts (e.g., discussion topics).
We propose link analysis methods to determine the importance of users in human collaboration networks. In this paper, we present the following key contributions:  X  called Dynamic Socially-Aware PageRank , in short DSARank. The calculation of DSARank is based on (i) interaction metrics ings, we present decomposition techniques to cope with on-demand calculating of importance rankings.

Software-Based Services (SBS). We position our work in the context of human computation and crowdsourcing . For example, human actors may solve tasks that are difficult to implement in software. Scenarios include a be performed in three essential steps: 1. Registration of human capabilities as services (profile containing a description of skills and areas of interests). the dynamically changing expertise of a given person. message formats (SOAP and related addressing standards).

However, since the crowd members' interactions are dynamic and their quest. This fact is captured by the arrows between the tasks and the in the network could provide a response. The other case denoted by Q by our expertise ranking procedure.

The nature of the queries Q 1 and Q 2 can be categorized as follows:  X  well-informed people in a social network depends on the person's activity level . We assume that people in a network are persons. The notion of expertise is in this case strongly influenced by the idea is mainly based on the concept of information spreading and gossip in social network (e.g., see [43,44] ).  X  engaged in (the specific focus of a person).
 Based on these discussions we define the meaning of expertise as follows: ular social network. In other words, a person may be considered as important in network A but not in network B. Also, the strongly influenced by modeling human behavior and communications as complex systems . In complex systems, attempts have been made to model weighted communication networks [29] , the dynamics of information access on the Web [45] , and bursts in human dynamics [28,46,47] . 4. Towards DSARank mining techniques in weighted collaboration networks that will provide the basis for DSARank. 4.1. Link analysis approaches well-known PageRank [8] , the importance of a node u is defined as: wards certain nodes. Without any preferences, a personalization vector with p  X  1 used to recursively propagate importance scores between connected nodes. Page et al.

The teleportation factor typically follows six links (thus, the reset probability is typically may notify one of its neighbors u about some news or forward information to a newly chosen node. posting questions attracting answers from other knowledgeable users, representing authorities A in the Q/A community. flows [15] .

Here we introduce the high-level model for DSARank. In open, Web-based collaboration environments it is important to cap-other words, certain nodes in the network may contribute more to the flow of information within a network than others. In our ranking approach, this behavior is expressed by both interaction metrics and the embedding of a node in the network.
In Fig. 2 and respective sub-figures, we show the three essential steps of our approach: lations as a directed graph, where the nodes denote network members, and edges reflect (social) relations between them.
Since interaction behavior is usually not symmetric, actor relations are represented by directed links ( Fig. 2 (a)). example, messages exchanged regarding certain projects or tags associated with tasks. Thus, G (subset of interactions and nodes) of the graph G ( Fig. 2 (b)). subgraphs of it. Based on metrics captured in the entire graph G , or subgraphs ( G of a person to interact within a specific context) and ranking scores are created ( Fig. 2 (c)). 5. Dynamic socially-aware PageRank
The next step is to define the human interaction metric-aware DSARank by considering a set of metrics. These metrics are based on interaction monitoring techniques. 5.1. DSARank model
The basic idea of DSARank is to introduce non-uniform personalization vectors . Recall that the standard PageRank model is based on a uniform personalization vector p  X  1 N jj their interaction behavior in the network in general or in a specific context. The formalism of DSARank is defined in the following: action intensity level of users. The behavior profile Bu  X  X  X  towards particular nodes in the network.
 { m each entry p ( n ),  X  n  X  N , by the sum  X  n  X  N pn  X  X  . Without metrics, each node would have been assigned pn  X  X  X  1
This model is sufficient to capture the requirements of the previously discussed query Q
To support more advanced queries using contextual information (i.e., Q tend this definition. First, we define the meaning of interaction context in the following.

The linearity theorem states that personalized PageRank vectors PPV can be composed as the weighted sum of PageRank vec-tors. By applying the linearity theorem, we have: tion of profile match (i.e., predefined interests and skills) and DSARank scores as detailed in the following:
The query Q may be composed of two query terms qt ={ qt 1 topics related to, for example, qt 1 =  X  alliances and partnerships bined matching DSARank score is created based on preferences for individual context's (expertise areas). 5.2. Interaction metrics

Experiments context-aware DSARank, followed by discussions of results based on ranking statistics. 6.1. Evaluation metrics ing definitions and descriptions.

In all our experiments, we use the  X  teleportation factor works into context-dependent subnetworks. 6.2. Human interaction networks
At the time when performing this research, most building blocks of the service-oriented crowdsourcing platform have been tors involved [53] . A simulation model needs to deal with these questions.
 our evaluation are twofold:  X  dresses scenarios where questions or tasks may be given to users that are expected to be knowledgeable (the edness  X  of a person or the expected response behavior of a person). For this purpose we take interactions within a small community (MIT computer science students who participated in a study) that were captured based on mobile phone commu-pose because weighted communication networks can be created to test the effects of personalized rankings. However, the on importance rankings (instead of simulating the communication behavior of individuals).  X  port scenarios such as  X  finding the most knowledgeable person in a given topic 6.2.1.

The dataset is based on communications between both participants of the study and non-participants . Non-participants are call other people and are being called). 6.2.2. Email communications
The second dataset is based on email communications. Email messages exchanged between people serve as input to establish is shown including the power law distribution N ( k )  X  k employees or between employees and other (external) persons. In our experiments, we only take those communications that were performed between employees.

Our approach helps to discover the experts users is strongly influenced by communication weights (e.g. frequent delegation or communication between two nodes). 6.3. Temporal correlation
We start ourexperiments byperformingrankingin the mobile phonecommunicationsnetwork. Theproperties of the network are secutive months. We calculate PageRank importance results denoted by PR on communications within one month. The first interactions were captured in 2004 month) and ended in 2005  X  05 (denoted as Period 11 ).This makes in total eleven months of communication data. users in two consecutive months using the Jaccard index, which is often used to measure the distance of two sets [59] .
The index is defined as J ( U 1 , U 2 )=| U 1  X  U 2 |/| U many changes happened in the network such as users joining or leaving a social network. In such cases, we expect PR
PR in Fig. 6 (b). We calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is defined within the interval [ mapping to [0,1] so we can show both coefficients on the same scale. We see in Fig. 6 (b) that the results in PR ranking scores. As mentioned before, this is an expected observation since fluctuations introduce a new collaboration general highly correlated in stable interaction networks (high correlation between sets of users). 6.4. Effect of interaction intensities mobile phone network we calculate the communication intensity and availability as follows:  X 
Communication intensity: The weighted communication link between two nodes is calculated as the average product of a set of calls between people exchanging information. Every i nformation flow between people, gossip or work-related news, depends on a set of calls that mutually influence each other. We use the geometric mean nication intensity i ( u , v )=( w uv D 1 w uv D 2 ... w uv  X  ing with others calculated as AV u  X  X  X   X  u ; v  X  X   X  E w D
The relative availability is calculated by dividing AV ( u )by strength to its neighbors.

In our experiments, we remove duplicated call information, for example, multiple call records between two users that have of users based on selected conversations in the mobile phone network. We select only those calls in 2004 ures i out and i in intensities are percentage values. The columns and rankB show results based on the unbiased PageRank model.

We show in Fig. 8 the results of the same collaboration network (interactions within 2004 values are rounded).

In our ranking model, two facts help to discover important users. First, i few inbound links from a single source, potentially with i rankings substantially. We could additionally penalize these cases by varying the IIL parameter 6.4.1. Kendall's  X 
In the following we discuss Kendall's  X  and ranking changes in the mobile phone network using a one-month time window to update rankings. Table 6 shows the comparison of DSARank and the unbiased PageRank with p 1 weights. Also we compare PageRank in the weighted network using intensity-based edge weights.
The first comparison (unbiased) shows that there is no strong disagreement between DSARank and PageRank. Otherwise, we portance of users. A stronger agreement in rankings is achieved by using i 6.4.2. Relative ranking change RRC moted or demoted given the users' AV and IIL . We calculate the range for both metrics as max ( AV ) to show how many users given AV and IIL were promoted; that is RRC and the unbiased PageRank. Over the entire period (Periods 1 promoted and 54% demoted.

OSim of DSARank and the unbiased PageRank are denoted as On average, we see an overlap of OSim =0.3 in the top-10 segment compared to the unbiased PageRank. tion environments since availability itself does not guarantee promotion of users. Individuals need to be active should be involved in interactions and collaborations.

Applied expansion and fi ltering a labeled message, we search for messages which are most likely related to the labeled message; for example, in messages from  X  and to  X  distribution lists) because we are interested in link-based importance rankings of people. 6.5.2.

Finally, we compare DSARank and PageRank in terms of overlap similarities. Table 10 contains the results for OSim texts have many overlapping tags with other contexts (relevance of interaction links with other contexts). 7. Conclusion The automated analysis of expertise in collaboration networks and online communities becomes increasingly important.
Crowdsourcing has gained increasing attention from both industry and academia. Crowdsourcing is a new business model where companies outsource tasks that were previously performed inhouse to open Web-based communities. Tasks can be per-and importance of users based on monitored interaction behavior and contextual link information.
