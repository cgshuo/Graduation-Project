 This paper presents a simple and adaptable matching method dealing with web directories, catalogs and OWL ontologies. By using a well-known Knowledge Discovery in Databases model, such as the association rule paradigm, this method has the originality to be both extensional and asymmetric. It works at the terminological level (by selecting concept-relevant terms contained in documents) and permits to dis-cover equivalence and also subsumption relations holding be-tween entities (concepts and properties). This method relies on the implication intensity measure, a probabilistic model of deviation from independence. Selection of significant rules between concepts (or properties) is lead by two criteria per-mitting to assess respectively the implication quality and the generativity of the rule.

Schema or ontology matching approaches aims at finding semantic relations (i.e. equivalence, subsomption, etc.) be-tween entities (i.e. concepts, properties) issued from two schemas or ontologies. In the literature, a lot of works deals with schema or ontology matching ( [4], [5]). The pro-posed approaches are issued from different communities but they mostly use similarity measures for discovering equiva-lence relations between concepts or properties. However, the matching process could be enhanced by using asymmetric measures which also permit to discover subsumption re-lations between ontologies entities. In parallel, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) [3] widely uses the asymmet-ric measures, called interestingness measures, for associa-tion rule discovery. Association rules [1] are expressions of thetype X  X f antecedent then consequent  X  X epresentingim-plicative tendencies between conjunctions of attributes in databases.

In this paper, we address ontology and directory match-ing by using the association rule paradigm. We propose a matching method using an asymmetric measure: the Impli-cation Intensity [2], a probabilistic model of deviation from statistical independence. Our approach, named AROMA (Association Rule Ontology Matching Approach), has the advantage to be simple because it does not use heavy ma-chine learning technique. AROMA has been firstly designed as an extensional and asymmetric method for matching conceptual taxonomies populated with textual documents (examples of such structures are web directories or catalogs). In this paper, we also show the adaptability of AROMA by using it for matching OWL ontologies.
The original AROMA method is divided into two main parts: (1) the extraction and selection of relevant terms for each concept; (2) the discovery of significant implications between the two hierarchies. In this section, we also describe an adaptation of the first part in order to deal with OWL ontologies.
The first part consists to associate a set of relevant terms for each concept of a hierarchy. These terms are extracted from documents indexed to concepts and selected by evalu-ating association rules t  X  c . Such a rule means:  X  X f a doc-ument contains the term t then this document is associated with the concept c  X . After this first pre-processing part, a conceptual hierarchy is defined as a tuple H =( C,  X  ,T, X  ) where C is the set of concepts,  X  is the partial order or-ganising concepts into a taxonomy, T is the set of relevant terms selected during the previous step and  X  is the relation linking concept to its relevant terms set (i.e.  X  ( c )represents the relevant terms associated to the concept c ). In order to transpose the partial order between concepts to their rele-vant terms sets, we extend  X  to the relation  X  as follows:  X  ( c )=
The second stage of our method consists in the discov-ery of implicative matching relations between concepts by evaluating association rules between their respective rele-vant terms sets. The algorithm takes in two pre-processed hierarchies H 1 and H 2 and considers only the terms shared by the two structures. The common terms set of the two hi-erarchies H 1 and H 2 is noted T 1  X  2 = T 1  X  T 2 .Next,we define the relation  X  1  X  2 which associates a subset of T each concept c  X  C 1  X  C 2 :  X  1  X  2 ( c )=
The algorithm provides a top-down search of association rules and uses two criteria for se lect significant rules. A rule a  X  b (between the concepts a  X  C 1 and b  X  C 2 ) will be significant if it respects the two following criteria:
The first criterion (equation 1) guarantees the quality of the implication tendency between the two concepts for agiventhreshold  X  r . The implication intensity of the rule a  X  b is defined as follows:  X  ( a  X  b )=1  X  Pr ( N a  X  b  X  vant terms for concept a which are not relevant for concept b . N a  X  b is the expected number of relevant terms for concept a which are not relevant for concept b .

For example (figure 1), the rule A 2  X  B 4has n A 2  X  B 4 counter-examples. Its implication intensity value is calcu-lated using an Poisson law (which is a possible model for the implication intensity): where  X  = n A 2 .n B 4 /n =6 . (30  X  8) / 30.

The second criterion (equation 2) verifies the generativ-ity of the rule and then permits to reduce redundancy in the extracted rule set. Indeed, a valid rule (i.e. a rule satisfying thefirstcriterion)issignificantifitdoesnotexistamore generative rule having an implication intensity value greater than or equals to it. A rule x  X  y is more generative than arule u  X  v if u  X  x and y  X  v (with x  X  y = u  X  v ). For example (figure 1), the rules A 2  X  B 7, A 2  X  B 8, A 1  X  A 1  X  B 7, and A 1  X  B 8 are more generative than the stud-ied rule A 2  X  B 4. The rule A 2  X  B 4 will be significant and then selected if none of its generative rules have a  X  value greater than or equals to its  X  value.
We propose an adaptation of the AROMA method for discovering implicative mapping between two OWL ontolo-gies. In this case, we also match the hierarchies of proper-ties. Contrarily to the web directories or catalogs, we do not only consider the extension of the ontology. Indeed, on the one hand, OWL ontologies are not often populated with a lot of individuals (or instances) and on the other hand, they contain very few textual data. Thus, we suggest to use information contained both in the schema and in the individuals data.

Contrarily to the original approach, this evolution does not only represent classes (an d properties) by binary terms. The schema information extracted for a class or a property data set are their RDF id attribute, RDFS label attribute and the binary terms contained in the RDFS comment at-tribute. In addition, we also extract the RDFs label at-tributes and the values of the OWL  X  X atatype Properties X  taken by their individuals. In case of properties, we use the extension of values taken by their range.

After have represented classes and properties by datasets, the method evaluates and selects the set of rules holding be-tween classes and properties issued from the two OWL on-tologies. The following step is the same that those described in section 2.2: we keep the taxonomy information by intro-ducing the inclusion of the classes or properties datasets into their parents datasets, the algorithm also works on the data shared by the two structures and, the same rules selection criteria are used.
In this paper, we briefly presented AROMA, a conceptual hierarchies matching method, and its adaptation to OWL ontology matching. This method have the originality to be both extensional and asymmetric. Then, the main advan-tages of this method are its simplicity (only association rules extraction, no combination of machine learning strategies), the consideration of semantic by using binary terms con-tained in the corpus and the stronger semantic offered by association rules regarding only similarity-based matching systems.
