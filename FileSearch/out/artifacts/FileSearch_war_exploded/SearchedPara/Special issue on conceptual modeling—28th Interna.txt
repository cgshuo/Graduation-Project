We are pleased to bring you this special issue of Data and Knowledge Engineering based upon the 28th International Conference on Conceptual Modeling ( ER 2009), which was held on 9  X  12 November 2009 in Gramado, Brazil. This was the fi rst time the ER Conference was held in South America and established an important milestone, the 30th anniversary of the conference. Since its fi rst edition held in Los Angeles in 1979, the ER conference has become the ultimate forum for presentation and discussion of current research and applications related to all aspects of conceptual modeling. In 2009, the conference program included nine technical sessions covering topics such as requirements engineering, schema matching and integration, ontologies, process and service modeling, spatial and temporal modeling, and query approaches. The program also included four keynotes by prominent researchers from academia and industry, an industrial session, tutorials and a panel in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the conference. In addition, several workshops and a PhD Colloquium were held together with the main conference.

This special issue includes four articles selected among the best papers accepted for presentation at the conference and that were considered as representative of the types and diversity of research presented at the conference. Each one of these articles is an extended and a revised version of the original paper presented at the conference, and went through a rigorous reviewing process, before being accepted for inclusion in this special issue.

The fi rst article,  X  Anchor Modeling  X  Agile Information Modeling in Evolving Data Environments  X  by R X nnb X ck et al., proposes a novel information modeling technique, called Anchor Modeling, to support the design and maintenance of data warehouses. A key bene fi t of Anchor Modeling is that changes in a data warehouse environment only require extensions, not modi fi cations, to a data warehouse. This makes it possible to iteratively model and apply fragments of a data warehouse, which supports agile ways of working. Furthermore, Anchor Modeling results in databases that in many situations performs substantially better than databases constructed using traditional modeling techniques.

In the second article,  X  Schema Label Normalization for Improving Schema Matching  X  , Sorrentino et al. propose a method to perform schema label normalization in the context of schema matching systems. The method semi-automatically expands abbreviations/acronyms and annotates compound nouns, with minimal manual effort, signi fi cantly increasing the number of comparable schema labels. They empirically prove that their normalization method helps in the identi fi cation of similarities among schema labels of different data sources, thus improving schema matching results.

The third article,  X  Revising the Constraints of Lightweight Mediated Schemas  X  by Casanova et al., addresses the problem of changing the constraints of a mediated schema to accommodate the set of constraints of a new export schema. The authors show how to solve the problem by computing the intersection of two theories induced by sets of constraints. The family of constraints considered in the article includes cardinality of binary associations and ISA hierarchies with disjointness, among others. how business analysts, business architects, and solution consultants use a variety of practices and methods in their quest to understand business. In their study, they analyze the nature of these methods, diagrams, and home-grown conceptual models as re fl ected in real practice at IBM. They also study important features of these models, suggest practical classi fi cations and characterizations, and distinguish them from drawings.

Several people have contributed to making this special issue possible. First of all, we would like to thank Jos X  Palazzo Moreira de Oliveira, ER 2000 General Chair, for having invited us to co-chair the ER 2009 Program Committee and for his constant support of our work. We would also like to thank Peter P. Chen, Editor-in-Chief of Data and Knowledge Engineering, for accepting our proposal to organize this special issue. We are particularly grateful to the Elsevier Support Team, particularly Mr. Rajinikanth Ramalingam and Mr. Harinath Subramaniam, for assisting us in crucial stages of the reviewing process. We would also like to express our appreciation to the authors who submitted their manuscripts to be considered for this special issue and also revised them in record time. Last, but not the least, we would like to gratefully acknowledge all the reviewers who worked within a very tight schedule and whose detailed and constructive feedback to the authors contributed to improving the quality of the submitted manuscripts.
