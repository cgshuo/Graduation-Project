 Analyzing Social Networks, S. Borgatti, M. Everett, J. Johnson. Sage, London (2013)
In 2002, the authors of the current volume published UCINET for Windows ( Borgatti et al., 2002 ), which has become one of the most widely used libraries of algorithms for social network analysis. At the time, a user X  X  guide also became available. But, the authors did not produce a monograph introducing the logic of social net-work analysis to accompany the software, as they intended at the time (personal communication). They have now done so, and it is a winner.

Analyzing Social Networks is closely connected to the UCINET software suite, but is far more than an extended user X  X  manual or tutorial (like, for example, this reviewer X  X  volume: Hanneman and Riddle, 2005 ). Rather, the volume is a practical guide to doing social network analysis from start to finish. It helps the reader understand what a social network research question looks like, how to think about measurement, sampling, data collection and management. It does cover, and very nicely, the now fairly standard descriptive metrics for networks, and basic statistical hypothesis testing. And, as a bonus, it has several additional chapters that touch cutting edge topics (working with big data, two-mode analysis, and ego-networks).

In their preface, the authors describe the book is organized in four broad sections; an alternative view might see six. The first two chapters deal with the network perspective and basic terminology for thinking about problems structurally with graphs. Chapters 3 X 5 discuss research design and data collection; chapters 6 and 7 dis-cuss exploratory visual and quantitative approaches to taking that first look at the data. I see chapter 8, on hypothesis testing, as a section in itself. Chapters 9 X 12 explore some of the key metrics for describing whole networks and major sub-structures of them. The final three chapters are a collection of stand-alone topics (two-mode data, large networks, and ego-network analysis). Those new to network analysis, or using the volume for instruction, will proba-bly want to start at the beginning and read front-to-back, stopping, if they will, when they hit the more advanced materials in the later chapters. Experienced network analysts can sample as they will; most chapters are coherent and useful as stand-alone read-ings. But, even the experienced network analyst will get a lot out of the entire volume. Each chapter offers remarkably clear and effi-cient summaries of key ideas and concepts. But each chapter also has examples, insights, and  X  X ab-lore X  that come from the combined wisdom and experience of three leading figures in the field that will be of value to both new and experienced social network analysts.
The first two chapters are quite short (less than 25 pages, together), and capture the dual roots of social network analysis in the more qualitative analysis of social relations and the more quantitative application of graphs to formally analyze structures. The first chapter is one that can be read in a few minutes, but is worth hours of reflection and discussion. The idea of a network and the levels of analysis in looking at networks are introduced (node, dyad, whole network). An interesting typology of types of relations, and a well-thought out example illustrate the points. Here, as elsewhere throughout the volume, principles and defini-tions come first, followed by elaboration, and then illustrations and examples. The writing is efficient, tight and well-organized. Impor-tantly, the first chapter makes a point of how relational variables are used along with attributes, avoiding the tendency of early SNA advocates toward relational reductionism. The second chapter, on mathematical foundations, is very brief  X  perhaps a bit too much so. It introduces some of the key ideas from graph theory and illustrates them with social network data.

Chapters three through five are a practical guide to designing a network study, collecting data, measurement and data manage-ment. For a 60 or so page discussion (about half of which is devoted to data management and transformations), the coverage is an excel-lent overview. Because the section is brief, more citation to deeper treatments of the subjects covered would be helpful. But all of the important issues are discussed. Types of designs with examples, types of nodes and ties and approaches to measuring them, relia-bility and validity and ethics are all discussed in chapter 3. Chapter 4 provides detailed practical advice to collecting data with survey methods (with a short side discussion of machine process data). Chapter 5 uses UCINET extensively to illustrate data storage and transformations. Both the latter chapters illustrate the most com-mon approaches used in most applied network studies, and are sufficient to get the novice going on collecting their own data.
Chapters 6 and 7 answer the question that I often get from new social network analysts who have, with great enthusiasm, designed and gathered some data and coded it into a matrix of relations and arrays of attributes:  X  X ow what? X  Chapter 6 is a very brief (10 page) introduction to MDS, cluster analysis, and related techniques for identifying proximities of nodes. It is heroic to attempt so much in such a short space; and, it is worth doing because these multivariate techniques are one of the best ways of getting a first cut at pattern finding. But, while the examples do help the reader to get a sense of why one might use these approaches and what one can learn, the discussion would benefit from a more explicit statement of why one would use these tools, and the major dangers and limitations. Chapter 7, which discusses visualization, works better. Perhaps this is because good visuals, rather than numerical approaches tend to be more broadly appealing to new network analysts. But, equally likely, the chapter works better because it is an excellent and prac-tical discussion. The extensive examples highlight the features of NetDraw, but the lessons could be applied using any visualization package.

Chapter 8, on hypothesis testing, is a gem. There is an expla-nation of the nature of hypothesis testing using full-population network data and permutation trials. Examples are used to show approaches to mixed monadic X  X yadic, as well as dyadic X  X yadic analysis with categorical and continuous variables. Short, but very clear introductions to the logic of ERGM and Actor-oriented (Siena) models are given. Co-evolutionary models, however, are not dis-cussed.
 The next four chapters (9 X 12) provide coverage of the core metrics for describing single social networks: cohesion, central-ity, sub-groups, and equivalence. Each chapter explains the general concepts, shows how the concepts are important in social network theory, and illustrates their application. These chapters rely heav-ily on UCINET in the examples and illustrations  X  which makes the book an excellent accompaniment to the use of the program. But the discussion is a general one focused on the algorithms and interpre-tations, so the chapters can be effectively used with any software.
There is a particularly nice discussion of block modeling for equiv-alence analysis that is, at the same time, quite advanced but very readable.
 The final three chapters, on two-mode data, large networks, and ego networks can be read as stand-alone essays on topics that are currently receiving a great deal of attention in our literature.
The two-mode chapter points out the importance of affiliation as a form of social relation, and explains when and how (and not) the ideas of single-mode analysis generalize to two-mode data (core-periphery, cohesion, equivalence). The  X  X ig data X  chapter discusses practical approaches to reducing big data sets to more manageable problems. It briefly (perhaps too much so) talks about sampling and approaches from statistical physics (scale-free and small-world metrics). The final chapter, on ego networks, is detailed and extensive, drawing heavily on the author X  X  extensive practi-cal experiences  X  they are an excellent place to start for readings planning this, increasingly common, type of work that focuses on bringing network context into individual level analysis. Until fairly recently, there haven X  X  been very many introductory guides to social network analysis. We X  X e mostly relied on Knoke and Kuklinski (1982) and Scott (1991) . Fortunately, they are excel-lent, and now are both available in newer revisions ( Scott, 2013;
Knoke and Yang, 2008 ). With the rapidly growing interest in social network analysis, we now have a number of new choices that con-nect research design, computing, and interpretation (e.g. DeNooy and Mrvav, 2011; Robbins, 2015; McColloh et al., 2013; Kolaczyk and Csardi, 2014 ). Each has strengths. But the volume by Borgatti,
Everett, and Johnson is an excellent addition and well worth a care-ful read, even for the experienced analyst.

The growth of network analysis has been ascribed to two fac-tors: metrics and visualization ( Freeman, 2000 ). If we were to name a third factor, it would be tools. In the past two decades, the dissem-ination of SNA tools (combined with the availability of affordable computers) was instrumental in the triumphal procession of SNA to a diverse array of scientific fields. Pajek ( Batagelj and Mrvar, 1998 ) is one of the tools that have played a crucial role in this process and that have enabled thousands of researchers in the constantly growing social network analysis community to actually do network analysis.

Pajek has been in continuous development by Vladimir Batagelj and Andre Mrvar for more than 20 years; its creators received the 2013 INSNA William D. Richards Jr. Software Award for creating the first software for large networks  X  X ith this design principle in mind X   X  Pajek was specifically designed from the start to be effi-cient for large-scale networks. Therefore, after publishing a general textbook on exploring social networks with Pajek a few years ago ( Nooy et al., 2011 ), the authors have now put out a book focus-ing explicitly on large networks. In the authors X  definition, large networks  X  X ave from several thousands to millions of vertices X  and can still be stored in a computer X  X  memory. Everything above that size is called a huge network.
 This book, Understanding Large Temporal Networks and Spatial Networks by Batagelj et al. (2014) , is not a Pajek textbook, but a text-book that uses Pajek. The book is about research methods, and the authors make their Pajek commands available to allow readers to reproduce their analysis. However, data and analysis are motivated by actual real-world research questions. In the very first sentence of chapter 1, the authors state clearly that the primary concern of the book is  X  X nderstand[ing] both large temporal and spatial networks in ways going beyond simple general descriptions of their structure. X  The authors go on to say that understanding networks  X  X equires concerns with substance. X  This approach has major impli-cations for the main analytical chapters (4 X 9) of the book, resulting in a very interesting approach for an SNA textbook. Instead of dis-cussing research cases in order to exemplify methods which are introduced, the focus of the narrative is not on methods but on the research projects themselves. In other words, the chapters are motivated by and organized through extensive discussions about specific research questions.

In the absence of methods that can describe large networks in one step, the authors enumerate two groups of strategies for handling such networks: statistical approaches and the identifica-tion of  X  X maller interesting subnetworks X  (p. 32). In keeping with the continuing research goals of the Pajek authors Batagelji and
Mrvar, the focus of the book is on the latter, the  X  X maller inter-esting subnetworks. X  Fig. 1 is a reprint of Figure 2.10 (p. 32) of the book and exemplifies some high-level approaches for reduc-ing large networks to smaller analyzable entities, all following a  X  X road strategy of divide and conquer X  (p. 33).

Chapters 2, 3, and 9 define the  X  X ormal core of the book X  (p. 384). Chapter 2 can be seen as an introduction to network anal-ysis (including centrality metrics and clustering) with a special emphasis on large networks. It also serves as an introduction to the language and nomenclature of Pajek, i.e. types of networks and network data (temporal, two-mode, multi-relational, specialized) and how to code them in Pajek. Basic graph-theoretic concepts (walks, cuts, etc.) are also covered here so that the book can also serve as a stand-alone introductory textbook to network analysis.
Finally, the two sharpest tools in the Pajek toolbox for tackling large networks and identifying interesting subnetworks are introduced in this chapter. Islands are connected subgraphs for which all nodes are  X  X igher X  (more important) than all neighboring nodes; k-Cores are sets of n vertices for which all have degree  X  k in the induced sub-graphs. The beauty of these two approaches is that the authors of
Pajek and their collaborators have already developed very efficient algorithms (and have implemented them in Pajek), so that islands and cores can be calculated for networks with millions of nodes in a reasonable amount of time. In this chapter it is also demonstrated how Pajek X  X  interface to R can be used for advanced statistics based on network data.

Chapter 3 describes approaches to analyzing large networks, with a focus on directed networks. In SNA literature, directed networks are often seen as exceptions and are barely discussed in algorithmic papers. In this book, however, they are treated as the norm. The majority of chapter 3 is dedicated to definitions of and algorithms for acyclic networks (topological ordering, criti-cal path methods, main path analysis, probabilistic flows). Most of these methods and algorithms are described with examples from bibliographic networks (citation networks, collaboration networks, bibliographic coupling). Another focus of this chapter is on mod-eling and analyzing temporal networks. While dynamic networks can be modeled in different ways, time slicing is the authors X  favorite approach. This approach is also used in Pajek to model (and code) networks over time. In a nutshell, in a dynamic network every node frames. For analysis, time slice networks are created for single or multiple time frames. Finally, the chapter also covers approaches for analyzing and visualizing dense networks (pathfinder algo-rithms).

Chapters 4 X 6 cover different application scenarios of citation networks. Chapter 4 starts with a discussion of Hummon et al. X  X  (1990) work on the structure of the centrality literature citation cut out network. The authors pick up Hummon X  X  suggestion to study the centrality related citation network following Freeman X  X  seminal article ( 1979 ), which was the endpoint in the original analysis.
Unsurprisingly, this approach results in a large network with about 1 million nodes. The authors elaborate on the steps for tackling this research problem. They demonstrate how to define the data bound-aries for obtaining the data from the Web of Science. Next, basic network statistics (e.g. degree distribution) are calculated, and it is shown how to deal with cycles in citation networks and how to identify the most important works, main paths, and interest-ing sub-networks (islands). All the steps of analysis, results, and interpretation are discussed in great detail. The final part of this chapter deals with the analysis of the SN5 collaboration networks extracted from the Web of Science in 2008 by starting with a  X  X ocial network* X  query, and enhanced with bibliographies of about 100 SNA scholars (p. 399).
 Chapter 5 shows the analysis of a network consisting of 3.2 million patents. Following their usual procedure in the book, the authors not only discuss network analytical methods, but give a comprehensive introduction to patents, their classification,
Supreme Court decisions regarding patents, and methods of work-ing with patents. The reader will also find a thoughtful boundary definition discussion. Line islands, vertex islands, and two-mode islands, as well as hierarchical clustering, are applied to reveal insights into the US patent system. The authors group patents into six categories and show the composition and connections of these categories over time. They also connect patents with US Supreme
Court decisions related to manufacturing. Identifying two-mode islands of patents and keywords can help to identify the topics of interesting subnetworks.
 Chapter 6 uses the network of 30,000 Supreme Court decisions citing earlier decisions compiled by Fowler and Jeon (2008) . The reader of this chapter will find a pronounced and very interesting introduction to the make-up of the US justice system and the role of the Supreme Court. In extending the original study from Fowler and
Jeon, who focused on using centrality metrics to identify important decisions, Batagelj et al. shift their attention to sets of decisions.
The network for the analysis consists of co-cited decisions instead of co-citation, since co-cited decisions seem to be  X  X ar more likely to share common features X  (p. 219). One step of analysis is the aggregation of nodes to a reduced network of islands. Some of these islands which receive more detailed analysis and discussion are related to Native Americans, perceived threats to social order in which freedom of speech (First Amendment) was not protected (decisions against unions, communists, the Civil Rights movement, birth control and abortion, obscenity), and slavery (Dred Scott case). For the latter, the authors distinguish between positive and negative citations (rejecting earlier decisions) and perform a triadic census to analyze structural balance. All these Supreme
Court examples seem to represent discussions about insiders and outsiders of the US legal system. The authors also spend a lot of time discussing data and methods and make a case for focusing more on signed networks when analyzing citation networks in general, and when analyzing Supreme Court decision networks specifically.
In chapters 7 and 8 the authors switch gears and move their attention to football (i.e., soccer) networks, specifically club-to-club and country-to-country networks created by players moving among clubs and countries. But these chapters differ from the pre-vious chapters only in context, not in presentation style. Again, we can find detailed discussions related to the substance of the research questions, this time concerning soccer in the English Pre-mier League (EPL), the highest national soccer league in England.
In chapter 7 the authors create 20 (!) propositions about struc-ture and dynamics (e.g. flow of players) related to English soccer. These propositions guide their research in this part of the book.
While chapter 7 focuses on statistical analysis over time (e.g. player fitness, the presence of non-English players in the EPL, players X  age, etc.), chapter 8 explores networks of clubs and player flows (transfers) among these clubs  X  that is, for example, the flow of players reaching and leaving the EPL, as well as within the league.
The authors incorporate contextual, non-network information into their analysis, including player fitness, club rankings, and salaries.
Consecutive moves of a player from club to club form a trail in the network. Trails from all players are clustered and analyzed at the end of the chapter.

In chapters 4 X 8, geographic perspectives were part of the anal-ysis. Chapter 9, titled  X  X apping spatial diversity in the United
States of America, X  is exclusively about geographic data. The 3111 counties of the continental United States (excluding Alaska and
Hawaii) serve as examples. Networks are created by connecting neighboring counties that share a common boundary. Every county (node) is described by a set of attributes and the goal is to cluster this network based on similarity with a relational (geographic) con-straint, since resulting clusters must form connected areas on the map. As attributes, the authors select 42 variables from US Census
Bureau data covering a broad range of socio-economic, labor, polit-ical, and educational aspects. The clustering is motivated by Joel
Garreau X  X   X  X he Nine Nations of North America X  ( 1982 ), in which the author argued that the US consists of nine culturally and eco-nomically distinct areas. Batagelj et al. show that a clustering based on actual data instead of anecdotal stories results in more complex sub-areas.

The final chapter, chapter 10, discusses the authors X  views and approaches to network analysis. This chapter also contains sev-eral critical remarks related to the analysis of large networks. The authors argue against the  X  X resumption of universal portability X  (p. 384)  X  not all methods fit all problems.  X  X atching of methods to substantive problems is crucial X  (p. 385). When writing this book, the authors were  X  X riven by a commitment to coupling substance and methods in a quest to understand large networks and the net-work processes operating both in, and on, them. X  (p. 382). This book is an almost 500-page argument that substance and methods can-not be uncoupled and that methods must be selected (or developed) to serve the purpose of helping to answer research questions.
While observing the emergence of more and more data sources for large networks, the authors state that there are four require-ments for useful network data (p. 385):  X  . . . the value of such datasets rests upon (1) how they were conceptualized, (2) how key concepts were operationalized, and (3) how the data were collected. X  The fourth criterion is how well the boundary speci-fication problem was solved. In a nutshell, while it is often easy to create large networks from available data, a lot of arduous additional work might be necessary to make these datasets useful.  X  X atasets seldom can be taken off the shelf and used blindly in an  X  X s is X  form X  (p. 388). Instead, getting good large-network datasets can take a lot of time and effort. The processes of how the authors created and manipulated their datasets are described in the chapters and more extensively in the book X  X  appendix.

The authors show a passionate and fascinated interest in under-standing scientific literature, patents, Supreme Court decisions, the global context of soccer, and the spatially distinct ecosystems in the United States. This interest is the driving force of the book, and readers expecting a textbook of methods and equations may be disappointed. Although at first giving the impression of a meth-ods textbook, the book turns out to be a great book about how to do network analytical projects. Chapters 4 X 9 can be seen as step-by-step instructions on how to comprehend, outline, tackle, and operationalize research projects related to large temporal and spa-tial networks. As a matter of fact, each chapter could have been a stand-alone research article.
 Even though this is the second book written on the software tool Pajek, the book can serve as stand-alone textbook for SNA courses, especially when the focus is on large-scale networks. As the authors represent a diverse group of researchers, the book is targeted to a similarly diverse audience in its coverage of every detail from the-ory to application to algorithmic implementation. At some points, the technical descriptions may be too detailed for some readers. Skipping these sections will not compromise the joy of reading.
But for the vast majority, this book is easy to read and entertain-ing, and much can be learned from it. Even if you know just about everything about large-scale and temporal networks, the book is a worthwhile read; you will learn a lot about SNA literature, patents, the US Supreme Court, and European soccer. The authors quote a
Johnny Nash song in the preface about there being  X  X ore ques-tions than answers. X  It is guaranteed that the readers of this book will find a lot of answers.
