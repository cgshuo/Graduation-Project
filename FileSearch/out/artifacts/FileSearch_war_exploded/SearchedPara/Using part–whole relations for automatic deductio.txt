 Abstract This paper provides a deduction-based approach for automatically clas-sifying compound-internal relations in GermaNet, the German version of the Princeton WordNet for English. More specifically, meronymic relations between simplex and compound nouns provide the necessary input to the deduction patterns that involve different types of compound-internal relations. The scope of these deductions extends to all four meronymic relations modeled in version 6.0 of GermaNet: component , member , substance , and portion . This deduction-based approach provides an effective method for automatically enriching the set of semantic relations included in GermaNet.

While most research on compounding has been carried out for English data, the present study focuses on nominal compounds in German, a language for which compounding is a particularly productive mechanism of word formation and for which the semantic interpretation of compounds is, consequently, of crucial importance for a wide range of natural language processing applications such as machine translation and information retrieval. Baroni et al. ( 2002 ) report that almost half (47 %) of the word types in the APA German news corpus, which they used as training material for a word prediction model for German, are compounds. For GermaNet (Henrich and Hinrichs 2010 ; Kunze and Lemnitzer 2002 ), the German version of the Princeton WordNet for English (Fellbaum 1998 ), the numbers are even more striking: 57 % of all nouns contained in release 6.0 of GermaNet are compounds. Since wordnets such as GermaNet are frequently used as knowledge sources for natural language processing applications, and since compounding is such a prominent phenomenon in the lexical coverage of wordnets, it is crucially important that wordnets include a principled account of the structural and semantic properties of compounds.

The structural analysis and the semantic interpretation of compounds have received considerable attention in both theoretical and computational linguistics. Syntactic analysis of compounds focuses on the correct (left-vs. right-branching) bracketing of the constituent parts of a given compound, e.g., [[ rock music ] singer ] versus [ deputy [ music director ]]. Research on the semantic interpretation of compounds has focused on the semantic relations that hold between the constituent parts of a compound. The present paper focuses entirely on the semantic interpretation of compounds; however see Henrich and Hinrichs ( 2011 ) for previous research on the syntactic analysis of nominal compounds in German.
It is widely agreed by now that in the general case, the particular semantic relation that can hold between the constituents of a compound cannot be determined by the meanings of the constituent parts alone but often requires knowledge of the linguistic context in which a compound has been used. (See Cruse 2011 ; Downing 1977 ; and Jespersen 1922 for a more in-depth discussion.) As a case in point, Heringer ( 1984 ) has pointed out that, depending on the context of use, the German nominal compound Fischfrau  X  X ish woman X  may refer to a woman selling fish, a woman whose physiognomy resembles that of a fish, a female fish, a woman who eats fish, etc. Without denying the open-endedness of the range of possible interpretations of compounds, various studies have pointed out that there is a much more constrained range of prototypical relations for the interpretation of compounds if one abstracts away from highly idiosyncratic pragmatic factors (see Taylor 1989 for a more in-depth discussion).

The exact nature of these prototypical relations has been the subject of considerable debate and remains an open research question to this day in both theoretical and computational linguistics. The debate centers around the number of distinct relations that should be posited as well as on the way in which such relations should be named and defined. The methodology used to arrive at such classifications is quite varied. They include proposals that are based on (i) specific linguistic tests, (ii) experimental evidence, (iii) particular semantic theories, or (iv) ontological considerations derived from corpus data. Linguistic tests have been proposed by Vanderwende ( 1993 ), Lauer ( 1995 ), and Barker and Szpakowicz ( 1998 ), who elicit the semantic relation between the head and the modifier of a compound by 13 appropriate WH-questions (Vanderwende), by appropriate paraphrases involving eight different prepositions (Lauer), or by appropriate thematic relations such as agent, beneficiary, and instrument (Barker and Szpakowicz). Downing ( 1977 ) draws on experimental evidence to identify 12 semantic relations that subjects most frequently evoke when faced with the task of interpreting novel compounds. The most well-known account based on semantic theory is that of Levi ( 1978 ), who posits a set of seven abstract logical relations, borrowed from the theory of Generative Semantics. Finally, Moldovan et al. ( 2004 ) introduce a set of 35 distinct semantic categories that are informed by corpus studies and that comprise thematic roles, general ontological notions, as well as lexical or conceptual relations such as synonymy, antonymy, and hypernymy. Some of the classification schemes are tailored to a specific domain, e.g., to bioinformatics (Stephens et al. 2001 ) or to the biomedical domain (Rosario and Hearst 2001 ; Rosario et al. 2002 ). Others try to be as general as possible providing a hierarchy of semantic relations, e.g., a two-level hierarchy (Nastase and Szpakowicz 2003 ) or a multi-level hierarchy (Rosario et al. 2002 ).

Apart from identifying the range of possible relations that can hold between the constituent parts of a compound, research in computational linguistics has also aimed at automatically predicting and classifying the compound-internal relations. Here, two main types of accounts can be distinguished: deduction-based and data-driven approaches. Deduction-based approaches are typically couched in terms of manually-written disambiguation rules that operate on conceptual structures (Finin 1980 ; McDonald 1982 ) or on a dictionary that assigns syntactic and semantic features for simplex nouns (Leonard 1984 ). Data-driven approaches include similarity-based (Barker and Szpakowicz 1998 ; Kim and Baldwin 2005 ) and corpus-based (Girju et al. 2005 ; Lapata and Keller 2004 ; Lapata and Keller 2005 ; Lauer 1995 ; Moldovan et al. 2004 ) accounts. The present paper offers a deduction-based account that is based on manually written deduction rules and that uses a wordnet as the underlying knowledge source. More specifically, the primary goal of the present study is to reliably predict the relevant relations among the constituent parts of German nominal compounds in GermaNet on the basis of part X  X hole relations encoded between simplex nouns such as Apfel  X  X pple X  and compounds such as Apfelbaum  X  X pple tree X .

The goal of the present paper is not to settle the general question as to whether the lexical semantics of compounds can be determined in a strictly compositional fashion or not. Nor will it attempt to posit and defend yet another inventory of relations that arguably cover the most frequent interpretation patterns for nominal compounds. Rather, it focuses exclusively on a family of part X  X hole relations as one particular subclass of semantic relations that are included in virtually every sense inventory of relations deemed important for compound interpretation. The rationale for limiting the scope of investigation in this way is the following: 1. By concentrating on one particular family of semantic relations, it tries to 2. The usefulness of limiting the scope of compound interpretation has already 3. It has been pointed out that the attempts to define a set of semantic relations for 4. Apart from its well understood semantics, the part X  X hole relation turns out to 5. By focusing on part X  X hole relations, it becomes possible to utilize existing lexical
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the modeling of part X  X hole relations in GermaNet and provides motivation for differentiating between four types of part X  X hole relations. Section 3 presents the analytical core of the paper by discussing on a case-by-case basis how compound-internal relations can be derived from existing part X  X hole relations that hold between simplex nouns and compounds in GermaNet. The paper concludes with a quantitative and qualitative evaluation in Sect. 4 , and discusses some fruitful directions for future research in Sect. 5 . 2 Part X  X hole relations (PWR) in GermaNet GermaNet (Henrich and Hinrichs 2010 ; Kunze and Lemnitzer 2002 ) is a lexical semantic network that is modeled after the Princeton WordNet for English (Fellbaum 1998 ). It relates German nouns, verbs, and adjectives semantically by grouping words (called lexical units ) that express (almost) the same meaning into semantic concepts (called synsets , i.e., sets of synonyms) and by defining semantic relations between these lexical units and synsets. Thus a synset is a set-representation of the semantic relation of synonymy. GermaNet X  X  version 6.0 (release of April 2011) covers 93,407 lexical units, which are grouped into 69,594 synsets.

In GermaNet, there are lexical relations, such as antonymy or pertainymy, which hold between two individual lexical units. In contrast, conceptual relations hold between two concepts, i.e., between synsets. They include relations such as hypernymy/hyponymy (which structure GermaNet hierarchically), entailment, causation, or part X  X hole relations. The part X  X hole relation 1 is a semantically diverse relation. In GermaNet (up to release 5.3), this relation was not further differentiated X  X n contrast to other wordnets.

The remainder of this section describes GermaNet X  X  new categorization of the part X  X hole relation that we prepared for the most recent GermaNet release 6.0. This categorization distinguishes the four meronymic relations of component , member , substance , and portion  X  X s listed in Table 1 . This classification is based on four criterial properties for meronymy. Three of these properties were first proposed by Winston et al. ( 1987 ):  X  Homeomerous/non-homeomerous:  X  X  X arts are similar/dissimilar to each other  X  Functional/non-functional:  X  X  X arts are/are not in a specific spatial/temporal  X  Separable/non-separable:  X  X  X arts can/cannot be physically disconnected, in  X  Countable/non-countable: The parts of an object can be counted or not.

While the properties of separability and countability are highly correlated, it is still useful to include them both. Lyons ( 1977 ) and Cruse ( 1986 ) distinguish between necessary/canonical and optional/facultative parts of an object. However, in practice, this distinction is sometimes difficult to draw and the question of separability therefore hard to answer: Is a kitchen without a stove still a kitchen? Is a keyboard without keys still a keyboard? Countability, on the other hand, is uncontroversial in such cases since the parts of the objects in question are clearly countable.
For each of the four part X  X hole relations in GermaNet, we introduce two relations: a meronymic relation that is specialized by the particular part X  X hole relation (e.g., has component meronym , has member meronym , etc.) and its corresponding inverse holonymic relation (e.g., has component holonym , has member holonym , etc.). 2
With an inventory of four part X  X hole relations, the GermaNet account is slightly more elaborated compared to the treatment of part X  X hole relations in the Princeton WordNet for English, which distinguishes three such relations: part-of (e.g., hand/ finger ), member-of (e.g., forest/tree ), and substance-of (e.g., tree/heartwood ). More specifically, GermaNet and WordNet coincide in the member and substance relations. But GermaNet differentiates the part-of relation in the Princeton WordNet into portion and component subrelations. This more fine-grained approach in GermaNet is motivated by the differences in properties between the two cases as shown in Table 1 : They differ in two of the criterial properties on which the classification of relations is based. 3 Using conceptual part X  X hole relations for deducing compound-internal relations This section presents the analytical core of the paper by describing how compound-internal relations can be derived from part X  X hole relations in GermaNet (described in the previous section). Figure 1 gives an illustrative example and helps to distinguish between the three different kinds of semantic relations involved, i.e., between lexical, conceptual, and compound-internal relations.

The synset Grapefruitsaft/Pampelmusensaft  X  X rapefruit juice X  is linked via the conceptual relations (indicated by the solid arrows) has hypermyn and has substance meronym to the synsets Obstsaft  X  X ruit juice X  and Grapefruit/Pampelmuse  X  X rape-fruit X , respectively. Note that synsets are represented by the grey boxes in Fig. 1 .
Further, the synset Grapefruitsaft/Pampelmusensaft  X  X rapefruit juice X  contains two synonymous lexical units Grapefruitsaft and Pampelmusensaft (the items in the boxes with a white background). Both these lexical units are compounds that have been segmented into a rightmost head constituent and a preceding modifier constituent (Henrich and Hinrichs 2011 ). For example, the compound Grapefruitsaft  X  X rapefruit juice X  has the two constituents Saft  X  X uice X  as its head and Grapefruit as its modifier. The relations has compound head and has compound modifier are used to identify this syntactic constituent structure and the roles played by each constituent. The conceptual relation between the compound Grapefruitsaft/Pampelmusensaft and its modifier Grapefruit/Pampelmuse is labelled with the part X  X hole relation has substance meronym .

The information about the syntax and semantics of compounds summarized thus far serves as input to the deduction rules that yield as output compound-internal semantic relations which link the constituent parts of a compound to each other (e.g., Grapefruit/Pampelmuse and Saft ). In the case at hand, it is the compound-internal relation is made of (e.g.,  X  X  X aft is made of Grapefruit X  X  ) that is added by the output of the deduction rule (see the dashed arrows in Fig. 1 ).
Deductions of this kind can be carried out for all meronymic relations discussed in Sect. 2 . Fig. 2 shows another example of this kind for component meronymy: the compound Messerklinge  X  X nife blade X  and the simplex noun Messer  X  X nife X  are linked by the conceptual component meronymy/holonymy relation (indicated by the solid arrow) in GermaNet, where Messer occurs as the modifier constituent of the compound. This existing relation between the two synsets can then be used for deducing a compound-internal relation between the head constituent Klinge  X  X lade X  and modifier Messer of the compound Messerklinge : i.e.,  X  X  X linge is part of Messer X  X  (see the dashed arrow in Fig. 2 ).

An example for member meronymy is shown in Fig. 3 : the existing relation  X  X  X undeswehr  X  X erman armed forces X  has member meronym Bundeswehrsoldat  X  X oldier of the German armed forces X   X  X  is used for deducing the compound-internal relation  X  X  X oldat  X  X oldier X  is member of Bundeswehr X  X  holding between the head Soldat and the modifier Bundeswehr of the compound Bundeswehrsoldat . Note that the modifier always fulfills the function of further specifying the meaning of the head, i.e., the soldier, that is referenced here, is a member of the German armed forces .

To complete the list of examples for each of the meronymy types, Fig. 4 adds a portion meronymy example, where the compound Kilogramm  X  X ilogram X  links to the simplex Gramm  X  X ram X , occurring also as the head of the compound. In this example, the compound again acts as the holonym, whereas the simplex is a meronymic part. The compound-internal relation  X  X  X ramm has unit measure Kilo  X  X ilo X   X  X  (dashed arrow in Fig. 4 ) is derived from the conceptual PWR  X  X  X ilogramm has portion meronym Gramm X  X  (solid arrow).

All deduced compound-internal relations connect the head constituent as the first member of the relation with the modifier constituent as the second member of the relation. Thus, in the instance of compound Bundeswehrsoldat , we write  X  X  X oldat is member of Bundeswehr X  X  , not  X  X  X undeswehr has member Soldat X  X  . The motivation for this convention is based on the semantics of compounds, i.e., the rightmost head constituent denotes the overall semantic class of a (determinative) compound and the preceding modifier further specifies the semantic subclass that the compound as a whole denotes.

Note that in all cases the naming of the compound-internal relations differs from the names of the part X  X hole relations that hold between the simplex and the compound; see for example Fig. 3 : has member meronym versus is member of . The reason the names of the relations have to be adjusted is due to the fact, that compound-internal relations always link compound heads to modifiers as the first and second member of the relation, respectively. In some cases (see for example Sect. 3.1 below), more than one compound-internal relation has to be posited.
As the examples in Figs. 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 show, different cases for deducing compound-internal relations need to be considered: 1. Compound-internal relations can be deduced for all four part X  X hole relations 2. Moreover, for part X  X hole relations that involve compounds, the holonym can
The exposition of the deductions in the following subsections are ordered according to the five cases defined in Table 2 , where several cases have further subcases according to their meronymic type. 3.1 Case 1: The compound has its modifier as a meronym This subsection considers all part X  X hole relations in GermaNet involving a compound, where the compound fulfills the function of the holonym and the simplex occurring as the modifier is a meronymic part. The introductory example  X  X  X rapefruitsaft has substance meronym Grapefruit X  X  (see Fig. 1 and its description) instantiates this setting: the compound Grapefruitsaft is the holonym and the simplex Grapefruit the meronym. In Table 3 , four different subcases for each of the different meronymic types X  component , member , substance , and portion  X  X re separately considered with the compound-internal relations deduced.

Some of the deduced compound-internal relations need to be described in two ways. For example in the case of component meronymy/holonymy, we deduce The reason for having two names is to be able to accommodate different instances covered by this subcase. For example, in the pitted fruit example (see Table 3 ), the stone is actually enclosed in the fruit, i.e., the fruit contains the stone. However, in the example of the apple tree, it would be wrong to denote the tree as containing apples, because the apples are attached to the tree, and therefore we speak about a tree that has apples. Similarly, for substance meronymy/holonymy, the deduced compound-internal relation is also referred to by two labels, i.e., by is made of and consists of . 3.2 Case 2: The modifier has the compound as a meronym When the compound as a whole has the compound modifier constituent as its meronym, all four meronymic relations modeled in GermaNet give rise to different compound-internal relations (see Table 3 ). In the case when the modifier constituent has the compound as its meronym, only the three PWRs component, member, and portion meronymy need to be distinguished, as shown in Table 4 . Substance meronymy does not occur for this case in GermaNet.
 3.3 Case 3: The compound has its head as a meronym While cases 1 and 2, which were described in the previous two subsections, involve meronymic or holonymic relations between the modifier constituent and the compound, cases 3 and 4 concern the head constituent as meronym (case 3) or as holonym (case 4) of the compound as a whole. Case 3 arises only for the part X  X hole relation portion .Here, the head constituent denotes a particular unit of measurement (e.g., Gramm  X  X ram X ) and the modifier specifies the amount (e.g., Kilo  X  X ilo X ) X  X ee Table 5 . 3.4 Case 4: The head has the compound as a meronym Part X  X hole relations with the compound as the meronym and the compound X  X  head as the holonym occur for both component and portion meronymy in GermaNet (see examples in Table 6 ).

For both subcases, the compound is not a hyponym to its head constituent, i.e., Sp X tsommer  X  X ate summer X  is a temporal part of Sommer  X  X ummer X  and not a kind of Sommer . Likewise, Nordatlantik  X  X orth Atlantic X  is not a kind of Atlantik  X  X tlantic X , but a spatial part of it. In order to be able to account for the fact that the compound-internal relation can either refer to a temporal or spatial part, we refer to this relation as spatio-temporal specification (see Table 6 for examples). Note further that there are other cases of German compounds such as Sp X taussiedler  X  X ate emigrant X  and Fr X haufsteher  X  X arly riser X , which appear deceivingly similar to the cases documented in Table 6 in that they involve the set of adverbials such as fr X h  X  X arly X  and sp X t  X  X ate X . Moreover, at first sight these  X  X  X alse relatives X  X , which denote hyponyms of their head constituent, seem to constitute counterexamples to the generalization that the compound as a whole denotes a spatio-temporal subpart of the head as in the case of Sp X tsommer  X  X ate summer X . However on closer inspection, the two types of compounds are rather different in that Sp X taussiedler and Fr X haufsteher do not involve the part X  X hole relation at all, and are therefore of no direct relevance for the purview of this paper.
 3.5 Case 5: The compound has part 1 and part 2 as meronyms Case 5 covers those compounds where the constituents of the compound jointly specify the compound as a whole. In other words, the constituent parts, referred to as part 1 and part 2 in Table 7 , are meronyms with the compound as a whole representing the holonym.

This particular type of compound has been referred to in the literature as coordinative compound or in the German literature as Kopulativkompositum (Eisenberg 2006 ). Two examples of this type of compound, which occurs rather rarely in German, are Baden-W X rttemberg and Strichpunkt  X  X emicolon X . Since the denotation for this particular compound-internal relation involves co-specification by the constituent meronyms, we refer to the deduced compound-internal relation in Table 7 as co-specification : the compound Baden-W X rttemberg is co-specified by Baden and W X rttemberg . Other authors, e.g. Barker and Szpakowicz ( 1998 ), have referred to the co-specification by the name of equative .
 4 Quantitative and qualitative evaluation The goal of this section is to assess both the quantity and quality of the automatically deduced compound-internal relations. To this end, an assessment of the coverage of part X  X hole relations in GermaNet and an assessment of the accuracy of applying the deduction rules for automatically predicting compound-internal relations.

With regard to coverage, it is of interest (i) how the different subtypes of meronymic relations are distributed across GermaNet, and (ii) to what extent the modeling of the meronymic relations can be considered complete 4 .
 The distribution of the four different subtypes of meronymic relations across GermaNet is shown in Table 8 5 . Cases 1 to 5 in Table 8 refer to the five different subcases (see Sect. 3) which are distinguished in the deduction rules for each subtype of meronymic relation.

The column PWR overall in Table 8 shows that among the four part X  X hole relations distinguished in GermaNet, the component meronymy relation accounts for 3,814 out of 5,054 (which is over 75 %) of all cases of meronymic relations. Member and substance meronymy jointly account for 21 % of the data with portion meronymy accounting only for 4 %. Only 26 % component meronyms involve compounds (see colum PWR with compound in Table 8 ), whereas for member and substance meronyms 52 % or more are contributed by compounds. Moreover, cases 1 (741 occurrences) and 2 (763 occurrences), i.e., part X  X hole relations between the compound as a whole and its modifier, jointly account for 89 % of all relations involving compounds. This skewed distribution is not surprising as it reflects the fact that most German compounds are endocentric, i.e., the compounds are specific subtypes (hyponyms) of their heads. Case 5 (5 occurrences) with the two part X  X hole relations connecting the compound as a whole to both its constituents has fewest occurrences of all cases. Again, this number is not surprising as it reflects the fact that, in German, determinative compounds are much more frequent than coordinative compounds (Hentschel and Weydt 2003 ).
 Table 8 also shows that not all logically possible subcases actually occur in GermaNet. The number of unattested cases (identified by 0 counts) is particularly high for member and substance meronymy. It seems particularly surprising that for case 2 (with modifier as holonym and compound as meronym), which occurs with the overall highest frequency of all subclasses in GermaNet, there are no attested examples of substance meronymy. Putative examples for this unattested subclass would have to satisfy the following properties: (i) The compound denotes a kind of substance, and (ii) the modifier denotes something that consists of this substance. At first glance, examples such as Flusswasser  X  X iver water X , Meerwasser  X  X ea water X , Regenwasser  X  X ainwater X , Roggenmehl  X  X ye flour X , or W X stensand  X  X esert sand X  seem to fit this description. However, notice that Flusswasser does not denote water that consists of the substance Fluss  X  X iver X . Rather, the modifier Fluss denotes the origin of where the water comes from or the location of where the water appears. Likewise, compounds such as Hosenstoff  X  X ants fabric X , Kleiderstoff  X  X ress fabric X , or Vorhangstoff  X  X urtain fabric X  do not denote types of fabrics that consist of the substances pants , dress , and curtain . Rather, the modifiers refer to the type of clothing that the particular fabric is usually used for.
 Even though an assessment of the coverage of the meronymic relation in GermaNet as such is not the main focus of this study, it is also of interest to what extent the modeling of the meronymic relations can be considered complete. This completeness is difficult to assess in absolute terms. Rather, it can best be estimated by comparison with an existing resource of the same kind. Here, a comparison with the Princeton WordNet seems the most appropriate since the Princeton WordNet is the de facto benchmark for all other wordnets. Completeness of the encoded meronymic relations can best be estimated by comparing the ratios of all nominal word senses and the encoded part X  X hole relations. In WordNet 3.0, this ratio is 15 %, with 22,187 part X  X hole relation occurring in 146,312 nominal sense entries. In GermaNet 6.0, there are 5,054 part X  X hole relations among 71,844 nominal word senses. This amounts to a ratio of 7 %. This comparison clearly shows that the coverage of the meronymic relations in GermaNet as such still has to be extended by manual, lexicographic work.

In the remainder of this section, we will present the results of the qualitative evaluation that focused on the accuracy of the automatic deduction rules described in Sect. 3 . This qualitative evaluation was performed by a manual inspection of the compound-internal relations that were automatically deduced by these rules. Altogether, 1694 deduced compound-internal relations (see Table 8 , third column) were inspected. In 1,619 cases, the compound-internal relations automatically assigned by the deduction rules were deemed correct. This amounts to a precision of 95.6 %, which is very high, indeed, for a semantic classification task.

The remaining 75 cases, which were marked a s incorrect during the manual inspection step, concern compound-internal relations that do not appear to be fully satisfactory. Here, the classification of the compound-interna l relations could be improved if a more fine-grained set of relations was used. A typical example is the compound Fruchtjoghurt  X  X ruit yogurt X  where the relevant deduction rule infers the compound-internal relation  X  X  X oghurt consists entirely of fruit. A more appropria te compound-internal relation would be contains rather than consists of . All examples of this kind are triggered by the deduction rule for case 1 of the subst ance meronymy relation. 6
Finally, there is a small group of errors where the automatically inferred compound-internal relation is clearly incorrect. These are cases where the meaning of the compound as a whole is not transparently derived from the meaning of its constituent parts. The compound Augapfel  X  X yeball X  is an example of this kind. Although the existing relation  X  X  X uge  X  X ye X  has component meronym Augapfel  X  X ye ball X   X  X  (case 2) in GermaNet is correct, the deduction rule incorrectly infers the compound-internal relation  X  X  X pfel  X  X pple X  is part of Auge X  X  . This is incorrect because the eyeball does not contain the fruit apple. Rather, the shape of the eyeball resembles the roundness of an apple. 7 5 Conclusion and future work The semantic interpretation of compounds constitutes an important research topic in theoretical and computational linguistics. The present paper has described a deduction-based approach to inferring compound-internal relations on the basis of the part X  X hole relations between simplex and complex nouns present in wordnets. Different deduction rules have been identified that depend on the subtype of the part X  X hole relation and on the referential role of meronym and holonym contributed by the compound as a whole and by one or more of its constituent parts. All relevant deduction patterns are documented in Table 9 in Appendix, a compilation of the tables contained in Sect. 3 for the different subcases.
 The present study has focused on German and the German wordnet GermaNet.
 Since there are a total of 1694 compounds present in the current version of GermaNet for which compound-internal relations could be semi-automatically inferred, the research reported here led to a significant enhancement of this resource. The exact frequencies and the overall distribution of the compound-internal inferences performed on GermaNet have been summarized in Table 8 . The qualitative evaluation of the deduction rules by a manual inspection resulted in a precision of 95.6 %.
Since part X  X hole relations have been modelled in wordnets for other languages as well, the present account should be easily generalizable to such wordnets. There are two other directions for future research that we intend to pursue: (i) to apply the present account to compounds that are not present in GermaNet yet and that also involve the part X  X hole relation, and (ii) to generalize the present account to the (semi-)automatic classification of compound-internal relations for compounds that involve relations other than the part X  X hole relation.

For both types of extensions, the semantic class information of the compound as a whole and of its constituent parts is highly relevant. For example, member meronymy is typically established between a holonym from the semantic field of Gruppe  X  X roup X  and a meronym from the semantic field of Mensch  X  X eople X  or Tier  X  X nimal X , but rarely, if at all, from Pflanze  X  X lant X . This observation can then be used for predicting the conceptual relation has member meronym between the compound Gefangenenchor  X  X risoner X  X  choir X  and its modifier Gefangener  X  X risoner X , since Gefangener belongs to the semantic field of Mensch  X  X eople X  and Gefangenenchor to Gruppe  X  X roup X . Once this member meronymy relation has been established between the compound as a whole and its modifier, the relevant deduction rule will then predict the compound-internal relation  X  X  X hor  X  X hoir X  has member Gefangener X  X  .

Conversely, some semantic field combinations do not occur at all, e.g., member meronymy between a holonym in the semantic field of Gruppe  X  X roup X  and a meronym in Artefakt  X  X rtifact X . The presence of those relations can be excluded with high probability. For example, member meronymy is unlikely for Kammerchor  X  X hamber choir X , because Kammer  X  X hamber X  belongs to the semantic field of Artefakt  X  X rtifact X .
Semantic class information is also very useful when attempting to generalize the present deduction-based approach to semantic relations beyond the part X  X hole relation. For example if a compound starts with a noun that refers to a location such as city or mountain , then the likelihood that for compounds such as city park or mountain cabin the compound-internal relation is that of located in is rather high.
Since GermaNet X  X  coverage of simplex nouns is close to complete, semantic class information for simplex nouns can easily be extracted from GermaNet in order to construct data-driven models for automatically predicting compound-internal relations along the lines just outlined. Apart from semantic class information, information about the frequency of the compound as a whole and the frequencies of the simplex words that make up the compound is also highly relevant for compound interpretation. This has been shown convincingly in the psycholinguistics literature (Baayen et al. 2010 ). This finding corroborates the traditional observation that a compound becomes more and more lexicalized in its meaning as its frequency of use increases. For example, the interpretation of the high-frequency compound Zahnpasta  X  X ooth paste X  is completely fixed: it refers to a paste used for cleaning teeth. The rather novel and low-frequency compound Zahnschmuck  X  X ooth ornament X  on the other hand seems to be open to several interpretations such as jewelry attached to a tooth or alternatively jewelry made from tooth material . This suggests that it would be fruitful to link lexical resources such as GermaNet with large corpora for German that allow the estimation of frequencies for simplex and compound nouns. However, we have to leave this significant extension of GermaNet to future research as well.
 Appendix The newly modeled conceptual part X  X hole relations involving compounds in GermaNet allow for the deduction of 11 different compound-internal semantic relations. These deductions are summarized in Table 9 .
