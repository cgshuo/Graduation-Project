 Many systems perform like complex networks, such as the Internet, social net-work, computing networks, biological network an d social system. There are many re-searches on the topology and functionality of the complex networks. It is valuable to and new products. 
In this paper, we propose the KSC (K-shell and Community centrality) model. This model considers not only the internal properties of nodes but also the external proper-based on community, such as the size and closeness of the community which the node luate the performance of our model. The experiment results shows that our method is much better to identify the most influential nodes. Identifying influential spreaders has remarkab le practical value in complex networks. It can help people control the disease transm ission, rumors spreading, computer virus spreading and popularize new ideas and new products. 2.1 K-Shell Decomposition Method K-shell decomposition [4] is a well-established method for analyzing the structure of removed. K increases from 1. 2.2 Community Detecting Algorithms Network community structure [5] is one of the most fundamental and important topo-than between which they are quite sparse. In this paper, we implement FN algorithm [6] to detect communities. We think that a node X  X  influence is determined not only by the node X  X  internal proper-ties but also by the node X  X  external properties. This is consistent with the philosophi-cal internal cause and external cause. KSC is a novel idea which combines the internal properties with the external properties. 
Given a complex network G=(V, E), the KSC value of node  X  o is denoted by: f the network. K( ness and K-shell. max  X   X  X  K X   X   X  is the normalized factor. C is the collection composed by the communities calculated by FN algorithm, d(  X  o , c) c, propagate messages to various communities which is related to the influence of  X   X  . which won X  X  be discussed here. To simplify the experiment while ensuring high per-formance, in this paper, the experiments use the following configurations: 4.1 SIR Model In social networks, SIR model has been widely used in the research of disease, infor-model [7] to simulate the propagation process, and compare the result with ours. probability of  X  . 4.2 Dataset Considering the different social network ty pes representing the different properties of applied to other types of complex networks. 4.3 Performance of the Experiment Only one node is chosen as the initial propagation node in each simulation. The prop-state I and R. We take the average F(t) of 1000 simulations as the final F(t). 
In one word, the classic centralities have their advantages and disadvantages. KSC is obviously the best in general. KSC is able to distinguish the most influential nodes and is suitable for more complex networks. are not the nodes with the highest degree or betweenness, but the nodes with highest K-shell. KSC is based on K-shell, but we take the external properties into consideration. 
Fig. 2 shows the comparison between KSC and K-shell. In Email, given K-shell=10, the actual influence F(t) is not constant and has an increasing trend with the increase of KSC. In the other side, when we fix KSC, F(t) is relatively stable, which is external properties are important factors to evaluate the most influential nodes. 
Fig. 3 shows the average number of F(t) (t=10) of the top-k nodes as ranked by the five centrality models. For example, in Blogs of Fig. 3, (x, y) is a point (node) on the curve of KSC. The horizontal value of the point represents its influence rank (i.e. x) in KSC model. The vertical value of the point represents its influence (i.e. y) in SIR figure. If the actual influence F(t) of a node is lower, the influence rank of the node in this model will be lower too. accurate. The lower rank nodes are more influential than the higher rank nodes. But the KSC model we proposed almost meets the theoretical curve and the real situation. 
The experiments adequately demonstrate that the influence of the nodes is not only determined by internal properties, but also closely related to external properties. the propagation efficiency of new ideas and products, and develop appropriate strate-model. This model is used to analyze the complex networks by considering not only four common complex networks, Blogs, Email, Router and Netscience as the datasets of our experiment. In the experiment, we calculate and rank the influence of all nodes influential spreaders than four classic models. plex networks. This paper provides a new idea and method for this challenging work. We hope it can spark the future studies.
