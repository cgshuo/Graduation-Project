 Online Course: Text Mining by Statistics.com (http://www.statistics.com/)
As data mining becomes more common in the work place, businesses are beginning to venture into new areas of data analysis. One area that is finding increased interest is the analysis of unstructured text data, also known as  X  X  X ext mining X  X . Typically, an organization will have a large database of unstructured text such as customer comments. The organization will be interested in analyzing this data using automated tools. Because text mining is a new field of study, there are few experienced practitioners. Therefore, busi-nesses tend to look towards their data mining groups to conduct the analysis. The data miners are familiar with numeric data, but modeling of text data is completely different. Therefore, the data miners are forced to learn text analysis on their own in order to complete their projects. Inadequate training will yield delays in the analysis project time lines and poor results. There is clearly a need for fast and cost effective training in the field of text data mining.

In order to address this demand, the Web site  X  X  X tatistics.com X  X  ( http://www.statistics.com/ ) is now offer-ing an introductory level class in text data mining. The instructor for the course is Professor Nitin Indurk-hya, co-author of  X  X  X ext Mining X  X , and professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. He is also the founder and president of Data-Miner Pty Ltd., an Australian company engaged in data mining consulting and education. The course is com-pletely online and each weekly lesson is self paced. The cost of the class is $449 plus the purchase of the textbook for approximately $60.  X  X  X tatistics.com X  X  will give early payment discounts, academic discounts, and Internet click through discounts. Also, students enrolled in the class are given a discount on the text-book. Students completing the course receive Continuing Education Unit Credits that may be necessary for some students with professional certifications needing to say current.

The course was four weeks in length with each week being a separate topic in the field of text based data mining. Each week had a Web page with a reading assignment and links to other Web sites with related material such as white papers. There was also an assignment for each of the four weeks. The assignment Web page allowed students to type in answers to problems and upload files such as the output of a program. Additionally, there was a discussion board Web page for each of the four weeks where students could post questions about the material and also questions about the homework assignment. Usually the instructors would post an answer within 24 h. Typically, they would post an answer within only a few hours. The material covered in the class is discussed below.
 Week 1
The material in the first week covered an overview of text based data mining. The reading assignments were the first two chapters of the textbook and also two online papers on text mining. The chapters in the textbook were fast reads and easy to understand. The material had an appropriate degree of difficulty. It made sense and laid a good foundation for the remainder of the course. The two online papers, however, were far too technical and were beyond to scope of the class. The instructors should probably revisit these papers and replace them with material more level appropriate.

The assignment for the first week  X  s lesson was to download two programs that would be used in the class and install them. After installation, the students were asked to run the programs using articles from Reuters news service. At first impression, the assignment appeared complicated and daunting. It also appeared that it would be difficult to finish within the one-week time frame. This turned out not to be the case, however.
After skimming through the online documentation and reading the questions and answers posted on the discussion board, the assignment was far clearer. In the end of the assignment only took a few hours and was completed with days to spare.

The total time required to complete all the work for the first week was approximately 9 h. This is con-sistent with the estimates given by  X  X  X tatistics.com X  X . In addition, the lesson was successful because the mate-rial gave a good overview of text mining and enabled the students to complete the material for the following weeks.
 Week 2
The material for the second week covered the use of text mining for prediction and class assignment. The reading assignment was the third chapter of the text and a white paper from a Web site on detecting email  X  X  X pam X  X . As before, the text was a fast read, simple to understand, and immediately applicable to both the assignment and real world problems. The article on Spam detection was outstanding. Like the text, it was clear and practical. There were other papers on the Web site, and students would be advised to read through some of them as well. It contained much useful material.

The assignment for the second week was more challenging than the first week. It involved classifying and generating rules to assign a class to documents. It required the student to understand the material and have a more advanced understanding of the software. This assignment did have a minor bug in the code, and it caused a one-day delay until there was a work around posted. There was still plenty of time to complete the assignment. In total, the second week only required about 6 h to complete all of the work.
 Week 3
The third week focused on information retrieval and clustering of text data. The reading assignment was to read chapters 4 and 5 of the text. Chapter 4 was again understandable and useful. The fifth chapter, how-ever, was too technical and contained unnecessary algorithms and formulas. This material was beyond the scope of this text and this class and should be moved to a more advanced curriculum. The assignment was again a valuable learning experience and involved generating clusters using the text data. There was little problem completing this assignment and the overall time spent for this third week was approximately 6 h.
This section appeared to be quite valuable for text mining, so students should consider doing additional work by further exploring the software and also downloading new data sets from the Web and analyzing them. Also, the instructors might wish to expand this section because there appeared to be less material than the previous two weeks.
 Week 4 The final week of the class addressed finding patterns and extracting information from text data files. The reading assignment was the sixth chapter of the text. It was a difficult read, and this reviewer did not understand most of it. The assignment was to extract word entities from text data using the downloaded programs. After working on the assignment for a short while and then reading the sixth chapter a second time, the material made considerably more sense. Still, it was a difficult read. Regardless, the information in this section was valuable and had many practical applications. There were no problems with this assign-ment and the total time required was about 6 h. As with the third week, this material could be expanded. Finally, there was a second reading assignment that asked the students to read technical papers and draw up a chart comparing them. Like some of the other papers in this class, they tended to be too technical and should have been replaced with material at a more introductory level.
 General comments
This class is clearly designed for individuals who have a background in data mining or statistics, but have little or no knowledge of text mining. Students who lack basic knowledge of data mining will find this class challenging and might not learn as much has they would hope. It might be better to first take an introduc-tory class in data mining before signing up for this class. For students who do have a data mining back-ground, they will find this class to be highly useful and enable them to complete text mining initiatives within their organization.

Some areas in this class that need improvement include updating the documentation for the software. It was too brief and occasionally contained errors. Usually it was possible to work around these problems, but there is no reason not to correct these issues. Also, the properties files for the programs contained many options that were not adequately explained in the documentation. During a rewrite, all of the features and options of the programs should be explained. A related problem involved the assignments. Although the instructors tested the homework ahead of time, problems were still encountered. This is likely due to the fact that the instructors are familiar with the programs and the students were not, so the instructors were able to work around any problem using knowledge of the programs that was unknown to the students. Again, this could be addressed by updating the users guide for the programs.
 Conclusion
The  X  X  X tatistics.com X  X  Web based Text Mining course will effectively introduce the basic essential tech-niques in text based data mining to individuals who have a background in data mining and statistics. Stu-dents completing this course should be able to competently work on text mining projects and will also have the necessary foundations to do more advanced study in the field. Because this is an introductory course, those who are experienced in text mining will probably not benefit from it. Also, those who are totally new to standard numeric data mining might first wish to take an introductory data mining class before under-taking this class.

Another nice feature of this class is that it is cost effective. In less than four weeks and for less than $500 (cost of class and text book), a manager can have a data mining employee trained well enough to compe-tently work on a text mining project. This is faster and less expensive than sending an employee to a remote training site or finding a university class. Furthermore, it is unlikely that either remote training or a univer-sity would do as good a job teaching as this online class. Another nice feature is that the online approach offers a high degree of flexibility so that students will not need to disrupt their lives by traveling or attending regularly scheduled classes at a local college. As stated above, there were some problems encountered with this class. These included minor glitches in the software and the inclusion of some reading assignments that were beyond the scope of the course. However, these problems were minor and should not dissuade an indi-vidual from signing up for this class.
Therefore, because the class is a cost effective, the learning environment is flexible, and the instructors successfully met their goals of teaching the basics of text mining, this class is strongly recommended without reservations.
