 How will a catchy phone application propagate among people? Will the excitement about it spike, oscillate, or decay with time?
Information cascades, like the above one, appear in numerous settings, like blogs, trending topics in social networks, memes, to name a few. Social influence has been a topic of interest in the research community [38,30,16,23,21,9,4,8,11,27] because of the rise of various on-line social media and social networks. In this work, by social influence we refer to the fact that  X  X ndividuals adopt a new action because of others X .
Our current work tries to answer all these questions in a large dataset of hundreds of thousands of interactions. W e obtained access to Polly data. Polly is a voice, telephone-based application which allows the sender to record a short message, choose among six funny manipulations of distorting his voice-message (faster, slower, high-pitch, etc.), platform for disseminating and popularizing voice-based information services for low-skilled, low-literate people in the developing world. We focus in two main problems, described informally as follows: Informal Problem 1 (Pattern Discovery) Consider a real-world influence network: Given who influences whom, and when, find general influence patterns this network obeys.
 Informal Problem 2 (Generator) Create a realistic influence-network-generator:  X  X iven a friendship social network (who-likes-whom)  X  X esign a simple, local propagation mechanism  X  so that we can generate realistic-looking influence networks.
 By  X  X ealistic X  we mean that the resulting influence networks match our discovered pat-terns.

Figure 1 gives examples of a social network (who is friends with whom, in gray, directed edges), and a possible influence network (who sends messages to whom -in red; directed, time-stamped, multi-edges). For simplicity, only edges between 1 and 2 are shown with time-stamp and multi-edge structure.
The contributions of this work are the following:  X  Discovery of three new patterns (laws): the F IZZLE ,R ENDEZVOUS ,andD ISPER - X  Generator and Analysis: We propose a local, efficient propagation mechanism
The importance of the former contribution is that patterns can help marketers and sociologists understand how influence propagates in a social network; they can also help spot anomalies, like spammers, or faulty equipment.

The importance of our second contribution i s that a realistic generator is valuable for what-if scenarios, and rep roducibility: publicly-available influence network datasets are notoriously difficult to obtain, due to privacy and corporate regulations; a good generator can serve as proxy. Reproducibility For privacy reasons, the Polly dataset that we used in this paper is not public. Thus, for reproducibility, we present experiments on public data (such the Enron Email net-work [22,1], and Facebook [2]) which exhibit similar behavior like our dataset. We also make our code open-source at: https://github.com/yibinlin/ inflood generator/ .

Next, we describe the dataset (Sec. 2), our discoveries (Sec. 3, 4 and 5), our gener-ator (Sec. 6), the related work (Sec. 7) and conclusions (Sec. 8). The dataset comes from Polly [34,33,32], a simple, telephone-based, voice message manipulation and forwarding system that allows a user to make a short recording of his voice, optionally modify it using a choice of funny sound effects, and have the modified recording delivered to one or more friends by their phone numbers. Each friend in turn can choose to re-forward the same message to others, and/or to create a new record-ing of his own. Using entertainment as motivation, Polly has been spreading virally among low-literate users in South Asia, trai ning them in the use of speech interfaces, and introducing them to other speech -based information services.
 The dataset comes from the first large-scal e deployment of Polly in Lahore, Pakistan. After being seeded with only 5 users in May, 2012, Polly spread to 72,341 users by January, 2013. There are 173,710 recorded interactions , spanning 500 MB of real-world message delivery log and 200 GB of audio data. However, this analysis focuses only on the forwarding of user recorded messages. In what follows, we denote a user with a node and a forwarded message with a directed and dated edge. Hence we view our dataset as an influence network.

We h av e I R B 2 -approved access to the full, though a nonymized, logs of interaction. Users may have been introduced to Polly by receiving a forwarded message from one of their friends, or simply by  X  X ord of mouth X . Many such users may in turn call the system, experiment with it, and possibly send messages to their own friends. Most such users cease interacting with the system within a few days. Still, a significant number of users stay with the system for a long time. How does these users X  activity change over time?
In the following analysis, we define a use r X  X   X  X ystem age X  as the number of days elapsed after the user successfully sends out first message. Moreover, the active senders after n days are defined as the users who actively send out messages on the n -th day after they sent their first message. Figure 2 depicts the F IZZLE pattern: the number of active senders (that is, users that still send messages to their friends) vs. their system age. It also shows the count of messages they sent, as a function of their system age. Both follow power-law distribution with exponents of -1.2 and -1.26, respectively. This observation agrees with earlier results of the behavior of elapsed time in communication patterns (see [30]): there, Oliveira et al reported shows similar power-law patterns in mail and e-mail correspondences, but with slightly different exponents ( 1 . 5 and 1 ). Observation 1 (P1). The number of active senders c ( t ) at system age t follows where  X  X  X  1 . 2 . Similarly for the count of messages m ( t ) at system age t .
Horizon effect: In order to get accurate information about the F IZZLE pattern, new users who are introduced to the system later than 110th day after it was launched were excluded. In this paper, messages delivered within the first 140 days are analyzed. In other words, all the users shown in Figures 2 have passed  X  X ystem age X  of 30 (no matter whether they are still active or not) because they were introduced to the system at least 30 days before the end of our analysis scope. This is exactly the reason for the deviation from power-law  X  X ystem ages X  of 30 and above are unfairly handicapped.

The detailed power-law linear regression results for the F IZZLE pattern, as well as all our upcoming patterns, are listed in Table 1. Notice that they all have extremely high correlation coefficient (absolute value  X  0 . 95 ). In a directed network, propagation from one source can take multiple paths to the same destination node. Of particular interest to us are two paths that diverge for a while (with no intermediate connections between them) b efore they re-converge  X  an event which we here call R ENDEZVOUS . This event type corresponds to diffusion into different so-cial circles (e.g. a-friend-of-a-friend... o f-my-friend, whom I am unlikely to know), fol-lowed by convergence. The prevalence of such re-convergences can shed light on the effective population size. In a large country like Pakistan (180 million people), the ef-fective population size for our system may vary widely and is unknown a priori. Thus, we are interested in the prevalence of R ENDEZVOUS as a function of the shortest path to the most recent common ancestor of two parents of a node, where path length and recency are both measured in terms of num ber of edges, rather than time. A node with k parents gives rise to k  X  ( k  X  1) / 2 different R ENDEZVOUS . Taking into account the edge from the common child to its parents, we have the following definition: Definition 1 ( n -R ENDEZVOUS :). An n -R ENDEZVOUS is defined as a R ENDEZVOUS where the shorter path from the two parents to their most recent ancestor is of length n  X  1 .

For example, Fig. 3(a) shows a R ENDEZVOUS of length 2: the shortest leg from the final node  X  to the starting node A ,is n =2 hops long.

Figure 3(b) shows that the length distribution of R ENDEZVOUS  X  in our dataset fol-lows a power-law . Most of R ENDEZVOUS have a length of 1, meaning that one of the parents is the most recent common ancestor, becau se it has a direct link to the other parent.
 Observation 2 (P2). The number of R ENDEZVOUS  X  n ( l ) at R ENDEZVOUS length l follows where  X   X  X  X  4 . 88 . Let the  X  X eciprocal activity X  between two users be the smaller of the number of mes-{ activity between a user and one of his recipients.
 Definition 2 (D ISPERSION ) The D ISPERSION D of a user with activity profile { m 1 ,m 2 ,m 3 ,...,m F } is defined as the entropy H of the normalized count distribu-tion: Therefore, if a user has a high D ISPERSION , she sends messages her friends more evenly than other users with the same number of friends, but lower D ISPERSION .
Figure 4(a) shows that the real D ISPERSION (entropy) is smaller than the  X  X axi-mum dispersion X  where a user sends message s each of her friends evenly. This means that long-term Polly users on average exhibit the D ISPERSION pattern when they send messages to their friends.

We can explain the D ISPERSION behavior using a closed-form formula, under the assumption that people send messages to their friends following a Zipf X  X  distribution, this, we can derive that if we use integral as an approximation of the sum part of the entropy calculation: Lemma 1. The entropy H of a Zipf  X  X  distribution is given by: The proof is omitted for brevity.
 Observation 3 (P3). Dispersion pattern can be modelled well by Zipf  X  X  law in our dataset. The mathematical analysis shows that the  X  friend contact X  distribution of a user with F reciprocal friends will follow an expected entropy value proportional to the square of logarithm of F ( ln 2 ( F ) ) other than ( ln ( F ) ) when we assume the distribution follows uniform distribution. The predicted entropy of Eq (3) matches reality much better than the uniformity assumption. As shown in Figure 4(a), the predicted entropy (the dashed blue curve) is a better match for the real data (red dots), while the uniformity assumption leads to the black-dotted line. First, we formally define the base and influence network: Definition 3 (Base Network). ABaseNetwork( V base , E base ) is the underlying social network of all people who are related to social information cascades. V base is a set of individuals. E base is a set of directed, weighted ed ges. The weights represent the strength of connections.
 Definition 4 (Influence Network). An Influence Network ( V infl , E infl ) shows which node sent a system message to which node, and when. V infl is a set of individuals. E infl is a set of directed, timestamped edges of which the weight shows the number of times a node has been notified of the influence by another node.

In our model, V infl  X  V base , E infl  X  E base , i.e., individuals can only be influenced by others they know.

We model all patterns by using I N F LOOD G ENERATOR . As mentioned above, Polly can be viewed as an influence network where people are notified of it from their base-network friends. After the notification, people may start forwarding messages. Why we need a generator The best way to verify all our three patterns (F IZZLE ,R EN -DEZVOUS and D ISPERSION ) is to study other influence network datasets. However, they are difficult to obtain, and some of them lack time stamp information (See Sec 1). Details of I N F LOOD G ENERATOR The pseudo code of our influence-network gener-ator, is given in Algorithm 1. In more details, on day 0, s 0 seed nodes ( s 0 =5 )inthe social network G 1 (e.g., Facebook or Enron) are notified of Polly. Then, each following day t , every person u who has been notified of Polly has a probability, P u,t , of calling some of her friends via Polly. The friends are sampled from the outgoing edges from G 1 independent of no matter whether they have been already notified.
 The probability of a user u telling other people about Polly is given by ,where parameter affects the exponent of the power-law that governs the decay of infection activities, and P u, 0 is defined the first-day infection probability . Estimating P u, 0 P u, 0 depends on the total weight (number of communication mes-sages) a user (node) has in base network G 1 . In fact, P u, 0 is set so that, in expectation, the number of edges user u makes on the first day msg u, 0 is proportional to the user X  X  total weight of out-going connection strength in base network G 1 ,i.e.
Note that in Algorithm 1, the process of sending messages is a geometric distribu-tion. Hence we can get msg u, 0 = 1 / (1  X  P u, 0 ) in expectation.
 Hence, we set the P u, 0 to be:
This ensures that a high weight node has more simulated edges. It is also more re-alistic, because more social people may spread messages more easily. In our setting, day. This formula is based on experimental observations.
 Evaluation of I N F LOOD G ENERATOR We t e s t e d I N F LOOD G ENERATOR in a number of networks. Here we use communication networks, such as Facebook, to be approxi-mations of  X  X eal X  base network. The results are presented in Table 2.
 In all experiments, =1 . 17 , and the number of simulated days is T = 140 . slopes k 1 are calculated based only on the first 30 days of interactions of each user, exactly as we did for the real, Polly dataset. Recall that k 1 is the slope of the F IZZLE pattern, that is, the slope of the number of remaining active users, over time, in log-log scales. For the R ENDEZVOUS pattern, the k 2 slope varies between experiments. This may be due to the small count of data points, see Fig 3(b). We also tested the I N F LOOD G
ENERATOR on synthetic datasets, such as Erd  X  os-R  X  enyi graphs of various parameter settings. Notice that the R ENDEZVOUS pattern is violated: the Erd  X  os-R  X  enyi graphs do not follow a power-law in their R ENDEZVOUS plots.

Because the I N F LOOD G ENERATOR graph is big, we observe the D ISPERSION pat-tern in Experiment E 1 . Figure 4(b) shows that the entropy footprint grows well with the Zipf X  X  distribution curve for users who have less than 50 friends. When the number of friends goes beyond 50, the entropy footprints seem less regular as the number of samples decreases.

Again, the I N F LOOD G ENERATOR code is open source, see Sec 1. Static graph patterns. These include the legendary  X  X ix-degrees of separation X  [29]; the skewed degree distribution [13], specially for telephone graphs [5]; the power law tails in connected components distributions; the power law PageRank distributions and bimodal radius plots [20]; the super-linearity rules [28], triangle patterns [39,19]. This list is by no means exhaustive; see [10] for more patterns. Algorithms for detecting these patterns have been proposed by mu ltiple research teams, such as [18]. Temporal and influence patterns. Work on this topic encompasses the shrinking di-ameter and densification [25]; the power law for the mail response times of Einstein and Darwin, [30]; analysis of blog dynamics [16,26], and discovery of core-periphery patterns in blogs and news articles [15]; viral marketing [23,21]; meme tracking [24]; reciprocity analysis [14,6]; analysis of the role of weak and strong ties in information diffusion in mobile networks [31]; identification of important influencers [36]; predic-tion of service adoption in mobile communication networks [37]; information or cas-cade diffusion in social networks [9,4,8,38]; linguistic change in online forums, and predicting the user X  X  lifespan based on her linguistic patterns [11]; peer and authority pressure in information propagation [7].
 However, none of the above works reports anything similar to our discoveries, the R We study a large, real influence network induced by the Polly system, with over 70,000 users (nodes), 170,000 interactions (edges), distilled from 500MB of log data and 200GB of audio data. Polly is a free, telephone-based, voice message application that has been deployed and used in the real world. Our contributions are as follows: 1. Discovery of new patterns in Polly: 2. Generator and Analysis :
With respect to future work, a fascinating research direction is to estimate the under-lying population size of our dataset, from the statistics of the R ENDEZVOUS pattern. Acknowledgements. The authors would like to thank Naoki Orii in CMU for sugges-tions and proof-reading.
