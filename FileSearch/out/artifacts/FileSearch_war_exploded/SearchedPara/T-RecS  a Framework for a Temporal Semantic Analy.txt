 This paper presents T-RecS (Temporal analysis of Recom-mender Systems conference proceedings), a framework that supplies services to analyze the Recommender Systems Con-ference proceedings from the first edition, held in 2007, to the last one, held in 2015, under a temporal point of view. The idea behind T-RecS is to identify linguistic phenomena that reflect some interesting variations for the research com-munity, such as topic drift, or how the correlation between two terms changed over time, or how similarity between two authors evolved over time. The implemented framework can be easily adapted for the analysis of different corpora and domains.
Several authors tried to perform a computational history of science by analyzing corpora of scholarly papers [1, 2]. Those works are particularly focused on the identification of topics and their evolution over time. These analyses are useful for mining trends of research topics and to dis-cover how science is evolving over time. T-RecS provides a set of services with a twofold purpose: first, to perform an author-centered analysis of the topics characterizing the RecSys conference series, similarly to the work proposed in [3]; second, to examine how semantics of topics has evolved over time. The correlation between authors and topics is computed by exploiting two different techniques inspired re-spectively to the Google Books N-gram Viewer 1 and to the Explicit Semantic Analysis [4]. The topic semantics is stud-ied by means of a framework named Temporal Random In-dexing [5] able to outline the evolution in the usage of a particular term over time. T-RecS is implemented as a web application and empowers users who want to know, for ex-ample, the authors who studied a given topic in a specific time interval, the most used recommendation paradigm in a given period, the evolution of the semantics of a specific https://books.google.com/ngrams words sharing the same linguistic contexts are related in meaning. In our case the linguistic context is defined as the words that co-occur in the same time period with the target ( temporal ) word, i.e. the word under the temporal analysis. In our implementation, we adopted the open source version of Temporal RI available on github 2 .
The Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) Analyzer is in-spired to the ESA technique [4] proposed by Gabrilovich and Markovitch, which establishes a correlation between terms in a vocabulary and semantic concepts extracted from Wikipedia. In T-RecS, this component builds a matrix for each edition of the conference proceedings, in which rows are the terms occurring in the proceedings and columns are the authors. Given a term, it is possible to compare the most related authors by extracting from the matrix the row vector of that term. It is also possible to extract the most related authors for a text fragment consisting of different terms. In that case, the system computes the centroid vector of the row vectors of the terms composing the text fragment. The column vectors of the matrix are used for computing simi-larity scores between authors. Indeed, the column vectors are bags of words related to specific authors, with a weight associated to each term. In order to define the similarity between two authors, ESA Analyzer computes the cosine similarity between their column vectors.
The GUI of T-RecS consists of the following components: a text box to formulate a query, an analysis menu that al-lows the user to select the analysis she desires to perform, a list of retrieved authors that allows to draw a chart tailored on a specific person 3 . The first interaction step is the selec-tion of the analysis to be performed by the corresponding menu. Next, the user selects the time interval for the anal-ysis, and finally she sets the following analysis-dependent parameters: Topic-Author Correlation . The Topic-Author correla-tion is powered by the ESA Analyzer. The author sort-ing parameter has two options: total (the ranking considers years with 0 correlation score), and relative (the ranking does not consider years with 0 correlation score).
 The authors list is shown on the right side of the GUI and contains authors relevant with respect to the query. The user can then select one or more authors and the system shows their contribution on that topic (i.e., the query) for each year.
 N-gram Analyzer . The user indicates the n-grams to be searched, separated by commas. The number of n-grams to be retrieved are limited by the Result Size parameter. The user can select one or more authors from the authors list and the corresponding chart is drawn. For each author, the number of times and the number of papers the input n-grams occur in are reported in brackets. The with smoothing of parameter allows the smoothing of the chart by choosing a value from the corresponding menu.
 Topic Semantics . The only input required to the user for this analysis is a list of topics (query) whose semantics will be analyzed. Topics must be separated by comma. For each https://github.com/pippokill/tri
