 The Automatic Content Linking Device monitors a conver-sation and uses automatically recognized words to retrieve documents that are of potential use to the participants. The document set includes project related reports or emails, transcribed snippets of past meetings, and websites. Re-trieval results are displayed at regular intervals.

The availability of recording devices facilitates the acqui-sition of multimedia data repositories for use in personal or corporate contexts. Meeting participants may talk about items contained in such repositories, but searching the data requires more time than they can afford to spend during their discussion. We have designed the Automatic Content Linking Device (ACLD), a retrieval system inspired by the  X  X uery-free X  [1] and  X  X ust-in-time X  [2] approaches, using auto-matic speech recognition (ASR). Its primary use is during live meetings, but it can also be demonstrated with a single speaker using a laptop computer, or over previously recorded material. The main components of the ACLD are the following ones. The Document Bank Creator is run before a meeting to cre-ate or update the repository that will be searched during the meeting. Text versions of documents are generated for indexing, and meaningful metadata is added. One-minute snippets of previous meetings, represented by their ASR transcript, are also included. All  X  X ocuments X  are indexed using the Apache Lucene open-source software. The Query Aggregator processes the words spoken by the participants, found by the ASR component, in batches of fixed duration or length. The stopwords are filtered out and pre-specified keywords are spotted. Finally, queries are constructed, with boosted keywords. The search results represent the content linked to current conversations. These are obtained for each time frame, and smoothed in time using a persistence mech-anism. Web queries are handed to the Google API, possibly restricted to a single website such as Wikipedia.

The modular User Interface can display its widgets side-by-side (in full screen mode) or as superposed tabs (in min-imized mode). The widgets show, respectively, the list of recognized words with highlighted keywords, a separate tag cloud reflecting the importance of keywords, the five most relevant document names retrieved during the latest time interval, as well as the titles of the five most relevant web pages. Hovering over result names provides a brief overview of the respective documents, showing metadata and excerpts with highlighted retrieval terms. Clicking on a result name opens the corresponding document with an adapted viewer, such as a meeting browser for snippets of past meetings.
Performance evaluation was attempted by enacting meet-ings and measuring the ACLD effect on the outcome, but the method was too costly. The usability of the GUI was tested with ten users, reaching ca. 70% satisfaction. Two focus groups discussed the ACLD, and found the general concept useful. The ACLD was also demonstrated to about 30 potential industrial partners, with positive verbal evalua-tion and suggestions for future improvement. Many sugges-tions were already implemented, such as linking content on demand, or highlighting keywords found in documents. The ACLD was supported by the EU AMIDA Integrated Project FP6-0033812, and by the Swiss IM2 NCCR.
