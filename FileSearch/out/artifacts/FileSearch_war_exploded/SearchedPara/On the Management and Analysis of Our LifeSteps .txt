 Dept. of Statistics &amp; Insurance Science Huge volumes of location information are available nowadays due to the rapid growth of positioning devices (GPS-enabled smartphones and tablets, on-board navigation systems in vehicles, vessels and planes, smart chips for animals, etc.). In the near future, it is unavoidable that this explosion will contribute in what is called the Big Data era, raising high challenges for the data management research community. Instead of trying to manage bigger and bigger volumes of raw data, future Moving Object Database (MOD) systems need to extract and manage (the minimum necessary) semantics of movement. Such semantics can foster next-generation location-based services (LBS) and location-based social networking (LBSN) applications, building more efficient and effective applications, while in parallel opening new research directions in the field of transportation, urban planning etc. In this article, we first present a novel model that enables the unified management of (raw GPS) trajectories and their semantic counterpart, and then we discuss challenges and solutions on the multidimensional analysis of such real-world semantic-aware mobility databases and data warehouses . Our recent experience from an interdisciplinary EU project we  X  X e been participating makes us confident that the envisioned approach will inspire the next wave of research in mobility data management and exploration field. big mobility data, semantic trajectory, lifestep, semantic mobility timeline, semantic mobility network, semantic mobility cube. Nowadays there are a large percentage of humans possessing GPS-equipped devices, from smartphones and tablets to onboard navigators (not to mention vessels and planes that are forced by law to possess and transmit their location on sea and air, respectively, for navigation safety purposes). As such, huge volumes of location information are generated on a continuous daily basis . Focusing on human movement, this information is useful for people to take advantage of nice on-the-move applications and services. Although grouped under the general term Location-based Services (LBS), they cover a wide spectrum: from traditional routing, what-is -around and find-the-nearest to advanced Location-based Social Networking (LBSN) applications, such as Facebook Places and Foursquare. Currently, LBS/LBN applications focus on the current locations of users, thus underestimating the knowledge that can be gained from the history of a user X  X  movement (her trajectory ) [3] . However, it comes more than natural that, apart from raw movement information that comes directly from GPS equipped devices, next-generation mobility-aware services and applications will also target at the behavioral rationale and motivation for movement in order to provide added value. Technically speaking, a (raw) trajectory is a model for a motion path of a moving object (human, animal, vehicle , etc.). D ue to discretization, it is usually defined as a sequence of sampled time-stamped locations ( p i , t i ) where p i is a 2D point ( x recording timestamp of p i [7] . On the other hand, a semanticall y annotated trajectory, in short semantic trajectory [13] , makes an alternative representation of the motion path of a moving object. Figure 1(a) illustrates the two alternatives: a raw trajectory consisting of original GPS records (top) and its semantic counterpart that contains meaningful and easy to be understood abstractions of mobility data (bottom). Maintaining raw trajectory information in a Moving Object Database (MOD) quickly results in huge volumes of data that make processing an expensive and demanding task. For example, by only keeping track of a (modest) population of 10,000 users driving on the average 2 hours daily and submitting their location with a sampling rate of 1 record every 5 secs, results in a database of more than five billion records (order of several Gbytes) after one year of tracking. If downsizing sounds to be the answer in the above problem, then extracting and managing semantics from (raw) trajectory data is a promising channel to do this. It is not only (actually, it is much more than) a matter of the database size; maintaining semantic trajectory information turns out to be quite useful in terms of content-related movement analyses (which will be the key issue in next-generation LBS). In the widely adopted semantic trajectory terminology [13] , movement is considered as a sequence of semantically meaningful episodes, either stops (e.g. at home, at office, for shopping) or moves (walking, driving, etc.), which results in detecting homogenous fractions of movement. Such semantic-aware mobility fractions and abstractions enable applications to better understand and exploit on human mobility: for instance, identify those meaningful locations where some activity (work, leisure, relax, etc.) takes place, infer how long does it take to get from one place of interest (POI) to another (e.g. from home to office) using which transportation means, conclude about the frequency of a n individual  X  s outdoor activities (recorded e.g. by a fitness application), calculate indices related to environmentally friendly or sustainable mobility, etc. In addition, applications built upon semantic trajectories can easily identify common behaviors among a group of people . As such, future semantic-aware LBSN applications can be established, including location sharing and ranking, recommendation according to travel and socio-demographic similarity  X  e.g. car-pooling applications [21]  X  etc. Although conceptually strong, such a representation of mobility lacks a robust DBMS support in order to realize the above model and give life to novel applications and services based on this. This implies a unified framework that will enable efficient and effective storage, indexing mechanisms of such heterogeneous information, as well as extended query languages to support novel types of queries and advanced methods for mining and multidimensional analysis. Section 2 argues for such an envisioned framework, while the two sections that follow present its core constituents, namely Life Steps and the resulting semantic mobility timelines (in Section 3) and the representation and aggregation of the latter in semantic mobility networks and semantic mobility cubes , respectively (in Section 4). Finally, Section 5 concludes this article, also providing an overview of the next research steps to be taken. Let us consider the following scenario: humans living in a town are moving around and stopping either by purpose (for doing an activity) or accidentally (e.g. due to a traffic light), and their movement is recorded by GPS-enabled devices and/or delivered by people themselves through diaries (usually collected for transportation research purposes). On the one hand, we have collections of GPS data that represent mobility in terms of spatial coordinates while, on the other hand, we have mobility information in terms of responses to where? when? what? why? etc. questions; see e.g. an example of a diary in Figure 1(b). Such data collections are quite useful for  X  X hat -if X  analysis. Consider, for instance, requests like  X  Find people who follow the pattern home  X  office  X  home from Monday to Friday  X  or  X  Find people who cross the city center on their way from office back to home  X  or  X  Find how many people make long trips (e.g. more than 20 km) on their way from home to office without taking into consideration the trajectories which include intermediate stops  X  or  X  how much time do parents spent for bring-get activities at the schools of their children?  X  , which are extremely useful in the transportation and urban planning domains. Modeling, management and knowledge discovery aspects on (raw) trajectory data have been exhaustively researched so far [7] [4] [15] , including plenty of algorithms and systems, spreading from data management [22] [14] [8] to data mining [5] [20] . On the other hand, semantic mobility data management is a relatively new entry in the research agenda. Models for semantic trajectories include [17] [1] [19] [18] [2] , while techniques for extracting semantic trajectories from raw ones have been also proposed recently [24] [27] [23][25] . In [13] , the interested reader may find a complete survey of relevant models and techniques. Generally speaking, a semantic trajectory is defined as a sequence of episodes , labeled either as Stops or Moves , each with associated meta-data ( tags ). Technically: -Stops are places (points, regions) where the object remains -Moves are the parts of the object X  X  trajectory in between two -tags are meta-data associated with Stops and Moves . According to the state-of -the-art model [13] , a semantic trajectory always starts and ends with a Stop , while Moves are found in-between two Stops . However, this model is quite restrictive in that it cannot effectively represent trips in diaries used in the transportation domain. In this domain, diaries only imply trips that are executed for a particular purpose. Here, travel and transport should be seen as a  X  X erived X  demand from the demand of act ivities. In this definition and its background, the ruling utility-maximization literature, people perceive transport as a negative utility that needs to be done in an attempt to satisfy needs and purposes in life, which are associated with a positive utility. As such, diaries do not contain  X  X ccidental X  stops like , for instance, stops due to traffic congestion. However, complex patterns like successive Moves (e.g. due to multimodal transport like for instance bus-train) may also appear. Apart from relaxing the above limitation, a generic model for semantic trajectory modeling should also be able to support modeling at various scales and/or spatio-temporal granularities. Consider, for example, of a person being at a shopping mall: although this activity cou ld be modeled as a Stop , novel applications would benefit if the model allowed drill-down (zoom-in)  X  inside  X  this Stop and examine the micro-mobility pattern of the person (detect the shops that she visited during her stay there, how long she stayed in shops vs. walked around, etc.). The challenge adopted in this article is to address the above discussed requirements at conceptual level by introducing novel concepts about mobility, called LifeSteps and Mobility Timelines (to be defined in Section 3), and then provide the seeds for a so-called semantic-aware Semantic Mobility Database (SMD) and its aggregation in Semantic Mobility Cubes (SMC) (to be discussed in Section 4 ). Figure 2 sketches the big picture of our objective: -at the bottom layer, a traditional MOD lies, which is in -at the middle layer, it is the SMD that provides novel -at the top layer, the application interface provides users with Note that in this envisioned framework; the two storage layers (for raw and semantic mobility information, respectively) could be physically organized according to any data management paradigm (centralized vs. distributed DBMS vs. Map-Reduce architectures). This decision is orthogonal to the above architecture, and such a discussion, although quite interesting, is out of the scope of this article. In this section, we extend the model proposed in [13] in order to overcome the shortcomings discussed earlier . First, we provide a definition for raw trajectory (and sub-trajectory), upon which we define the core concept of our model: the so-called semantic mobility timeline . Figure 3 illustrates two typical semantic mobility timelines (with blue and red color, respectively) that will serve as the running example for the discussion that will follow. Definition 1 (raw trajectory) : a (raw) trajectory object is defined as a triple (o-id, traj-id, T), where o-id (traj-id) is the identifier of the moving object (the specific trajectory of the moving object, resp.) and T is a 3D polyline consisting of a sequence of N+1 pairs (p i , t i ), 0  X  i  X  N, assuming linear interpolation between two consecutive pairs (p i , t i ) and (p where p i is a 2D point (x i , y i ) in the plane and t i Definition 2 (raw sub-trajectory) : a (raw) sub-trajectory (raw) trajectory  X  is defined as a quadruplet (o-id, traj-id, subtraj-id, T X ), where o -id (traj-id, subtraj-id) is the identifier of the moving object (the specific trajectory and sub-trajectory of the moving object, resp.) a nd T X  is the portion of T between two timestamps, t i and t j , t i &lt; t j .
 Having the above definitions in our hands, we define the necessary concepts towards the semantic counterparts of raw (sub-)trajectories. Definition 3 (Stop) : a Stop corresponds to a sub-trajectory with specific spatio-temporal properties. In particular, a sub-trajectory  X   X  is labeled as  X  X top X  iff its spatial (temporal) projection obeys a predefined spatial (temporal, resp.) constraint C Obviously, the constraints responsible for characterizing a part of the trajectory of a moving object as Stop (C space are related to the spatiotemporal properties of the object and are application-oriented. Examples of C space could be:  X ... lies within a circle of radius less than a threshold  X   X ;  X ... lies within distance less than a threshold  X  from a POI X ; etc. On the other hand, an example of C time could be  X ... is an interval of duration more than a threshold  X   X  . Definition 4 (ActivityStop) : an ActivityStop corresponds to a sub-trajectory  X   X  with specific spatio -temporal and thematic properties. In particular, a sub-trajectory  X   X  is labeled as  X  X ctivityStop X  iff its spatial (temporal) projection obeys a predefined spatial (temporal, resp.) constraint C space (C and it obeys a predefined thematic constraint C thematic . Conceptually, an ActivityStop differs from a Stop in that the spatio-temporal constraints (i) are not necessarily identical and (ii) should be accompanied (in the case of ActivityStop) by an activity which takes place at the region defined by the spatial constraints, implying the purpose for being located at that specific place at that specific time. In different words, the thematic properties imply the purpose for which the object moved to the corresponding spatial area. On the contrary, a Stop may correspond to a forced or unintentional stop of moving object X  X  transposition. In the example of Figure 3, stopping at the parking area or at the traffic light correspond to a Stop, while stopping at e.g. a school for dropping a child is an ActivityStop. Definition 5 (MeteorStep) : a MeteorStep corresponds to a sub-trajectory  X   X  whose T X  component (i.e., the corresponding 3D polyline) is unknown or empty (aka NULL). Furthermore, according to the two sub-trajectories before and after sub-trajectory  X   X , (denoted as  X   X  before and  X   X  after MeteorStep is labeled as: - X  X topGap X , iff  X   X  before and  X   X  after  X  X lmost meet X  w.r.t. - X  X top&amp;Go X , iff  X   X  before and  X   X  after  X  X lmost meet X  w.r.t. a - X  X oveGap X , otherwise. In order to complete the above definition, we need to clarify the terms  X  X lmost meet X  and  X  X uite dissimilar X  that appear there. In particular: -two sub-trajectories  X   X  before and  X   X  after  X  X lmost meet X  w.r.t. -two sub-trajectories  X   X  before and  X   X  after are  X  X uite dissimilar X , Intuitively, a  X  X topGap X  corresponds to a period of time where there is lack of information for the raw trajectory of a moving object, referring e.g. to a user who switches off her GPS when returning home in the evening and switches it on again the next morning, see the blue trajectory in Figure 3. (Obviously, in this case we cannot infer whether the object has moved during the in-between period of time.) Similarly, a  X  X top&amp;Go X  is a MeteorStep, which implies a change of mode with zero or negligible duration (e.g. the moving object of Figure 3 has changed from  X  X riving X  to  X  X alking X  mode at the Parking, because the characteristics (e.g. average speed) of the two sub-trajectories, before and after the Parking, are quite different). The previous example implies a change in the spatio-temporal behavior of the moving object, while an example of a thematic change could be the passing of border (e.g. moving from industrial area A to university campus B). On the other hand, in a  X  X oveGap X  we are confident tha t the object has moved (comparing the before and after statuses) but we cannot argue how or when or by following which route it moved; see e.g. the transposition from office to restaurant in Figure 3. Definition 6 (Move) : a sub-trajectory  X   X  is labeled as  X  X ove X  iff it is neither a Stop nor an ActivityStop nor a MeteorStep.
 At this point, we have been able to label a portion of movement as either Stop (with the distinct case of ActivityStop included) or Move, also providing support to special cases that may happen due to lack of information (MeteorStep). Definition 7 (LifeStep) : a LifeStep ls corresponds to a sub-trajectory  X   X  and is defined as a tuple (LifeStepID, LifeStepFlag, MBB, tags, T-link, Z-In, Z-Out), where: -LifeStepID is the identifier of the LifeStep, -LifeStepFlag is a flag taking values from the set { X  X ove X  -MBB is a tuple (MBR, t start , t end ) corresponding to the 3D -tags is a set of keywords, describing the corresponding -T-link is a link to  X   X , -Z-In and Z-Out are pointers to semantic mobility timelines Actually, Z-In and Z-Out attributes imply a recursive definition in order to support the zoom-in/out in different spatial scales ; e.g. an ActivityStop at a shopping mall may be analyzed at a more specific level by looking at the shops where the user visited . At this point, we are ready to provide the definition of semantically-annotated (in short, semantic ) mobility timeline. Definition 8 (semantic mobility timeline) : a semantic mobility timeline  X  sem of a moving object is defined as a triple (o-id, timeline-id, T LS ), where o-id (timeline-id) is the identifier of the moving object (the semantic mobility timeline of the moving object, resp.) and T LS is a sequence of LifeSteps belonging to the same trajectory  X  and being successive in time, i.e., s s Back to our running example of Figure 3 and according to the above definitions, e.g. the blue semantic mobility timeline consists of a sequence of 17 LifeSteps as follows (only LifeStepIDs and LifeStepFlags are listed): We can infer that the proposed model is generic compared to state-of -the-art [13] since it relaxes some key limitations of the latter. In particular, according to [13] , (i) a semantic trajectory (semantic mobility timeline, in our terminology) should start and end with a Stop (Stop or ActivityStop, in our model) episode and (ii) it is not allowed to have successive Move episodes. By relaxing these limitations and providing more alternatives than the typical Stop and Move episodes makes our model strong enough to support several application-oriented requirements. By comparing Definitions 1 and 8, it is clear that the content of a MOD (raw trajectories) and that of a SMD (semantic mobility timelines) do not have much in common. This means that an existing MOD, such as the state-of -the-art Hermes [14] and Secondo [8] engines, cannot be used as-is in order to handle such SMD. Moreover, as we are interested in a unified framework wherein both raw and semantic data exist, efficiently and effectively querying MOD and SMD repositories is also challenging. Recalling the transportation example discussed in Section 2, three types of queries are foreseen: -Q1 ( MOD queries ): queries over the raw trajectories stored -Q2 ( SMD queries ): queries over the semantic mobility -Q3 ( MOD-SMD cross-over queries ): queries jointly Construction methods Primitive methods  X  Space/time derivatives Advanced operators  X  Similarity  X  Mining As already discussed, Q1-type queries (range, nearest-neighbor, enter, cross, etc.) have been extensively studied in the MOD literature. On the other hand, Q2-and Q3-type queries are innovative and they cannot be considered as straightforward variations of Q1-type queries. Towards the realization of the above, let us assume that we adopt the object-relational (OR) approach and define a Timeline datatype (and a LifeStep datatype as a subtype of the former). Several examples of methods and operators to be built upon these datatypes are listed in Table 1. A first set of methods to be supported includes direct variants of space/time derivatives already defined for raw trajectories in MODs. More interesting seem the extensions of methods that filter one timeline or a SMD (implying that timelines are indexed), according to any conjunction of spatial, temporal, or semantic conditions. Consider for example an operand that computes the OD-matrix for a specific set of activities, in a city, during a particular day. For instance, OD-matrix computation can be translated as a conjunction of range queries as those implied in Table 1. Another set of interesting methods includes post-processing functions for timelines, inspired by well-known techniques applicable in raw trajectories. For instance, compressing a timeline (its spatio-temporal and/or semantic component), enable us to minimize the storage cost without sacrificing quality of representation. Similarly, a (dis-)aggregation method that allows browsing of a timeline at different scales sounds important. In addition to the above operators, the envisioned framework should be able to support advanced operators, extending well-known mobility mining methods for SMD, e.g.,  X  what is the most common stop in area A  X  ,  X  how frequent is the move from area A to area B  X  ,  X  which is the most representative timeline of a set forming a sequential mobility pattern  X ,  X  how timelines of last week are grouped together  X  or more specifically,  X  which flocks, convoys and/or moving clusters are formed when semantics is taken into account  X , etc. Traditionally, aggregated information from DBs is stored in a Data Warehouse (DW), in the form of data cubes [6] . Data cubes are views of a DW, used for multi-dimensional analysis, the so-called On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP). The data cube paradigm has been extended to support spatial [9] , and (raw) trajectory DWs [12] [10] , involving spatial, temporal and thematic dimensions as well as spatial, spatio-temporal and numerical measures. As a step forward, we introduce the notion of Semantic-aware Mobility Data Cube (SMDC), where aggregated data should not only expose interesting measures w.r.t. the chosen dimensions via a relational format, but they should directly encapsulate the spatial topology and its intrinsic relationships. To succeed this ambitious goal, we first define the so-called Semantic Mobility Network (SMN), a dynamic graph representation of the semantic mobility timelines stored in an SMD. To illustrate the idea of SMN, Figure 4(a) presents the timeline of the blue trajectory of Figure 3 extended to include a 2-days period. Typically, during the second day, the user may follow a slightly different timeline. Figure 4(b) illustrates a graph representation of this timeline, in which vertices and edges correspond to non-Mo ve -and Move -type LifeSteps , respectively. The  X  X eights X  of vertices and edges are sequences of tuples describing interesting properties of the corresponding LifeSteps , such as distinct number of timelines or users, distinct number of activities, average speed, radius of gyration, pot ential area of activity, etc.) The cardinality of the sequence of tuples corresponds to a discretization of the time domain. In Figure 4(c), we depict an aggregate view of the SMN, where the aggregation occurs in the temporal dimension. A nice interesting characteristic of a SMN, which we believe is a breakthrough for the mobility management and analysis domain, is that this graph-based design is data-driven and unifies all the mobility-related dimensions (space, time, semantics). Below, we provide formal definitions of a SMN and an aggregate SMN: Definition 9 (semantic mobility network) : A semantic mobility network N, is a graph denoted by N = (V, E, M), where V is a set of vertices, E  X  V  X  V is a set of edges and M = {M 1 , M set of measures applicable to vertices and edges, i.e.  X  v  X  V and  X  e  X  E, there is a tuple M(v) of v and M(e) of e respectively, denoted as M(v) = (M 1 (v), M 2 (v), ..., M n (v)) and M(e) = (M M (e), ..., M n (e)), where M i (v) and M i (e) is the value of v and e on i-th measure, 1  X  i  X  n. The set V of vertices corresponds to the union of all distinct LifeSteps that are not of Move type (i.e., either Move or MoveGap), of all mobility timelines  X  sem set E of edges corresponds to the union of the Move type LifeSteps. The set M of measures is a set of scalars quantifying properties of vertices and edges. Definition 10 (aggregate semantic mobility network) : Given a semantic mobility network N, a set of dimensions D = {D 1 D } with their corresponding hierarchies, an aggregation D {D a 1 , D a 2 , ..., D a m } along these hierarchies, with D D 2 (v), ..., D a m (v)) denoting a tuple of values D dimension, 1  X  j  X  m (similarly, D a (e) is defined), upon which measure M i can be aggregated, an aggregate semantic mobility network w.r.t. D a is a semantic mobility network N M ), where: i. V a is the set of aggregate vertices v a  X  V a ii. E a is the set of aggregate edges e a  X  E a iii. M a is the set of aggregate measures, each of which is Note that the set of measures may be different for vertices and edges depending on the application, while the A(  X  ) aggregate function may be different (e.g. COUNT(  X  ) or AVERAGE(  X  )) for each of the measures M i . Of course, in case of spatial or spatio-temporal measures will probably require more sophisticated aggregate functions. The key issue is for the aggregate function not to be holistic, so as the super-aggregates cannot be computed from sub-aggregates, even if we employ auxiliary measures [6] . Note also that the unification process U V ( U E ) operates on the spatio-temporal and semantic properties of the non-Move type (Move type, respectively) LifeSteps. Definition 11 (semantic mobility cube) : Given a semantic mobility network N = (V, E, M) and a set of dimensions D = {D D , ..., D m } with their corresponding hierarchies, the semantic mobility cube is the lattice of the aggregate semantic mobility networks produced by all possible aggregations in D.
 The above definition implies that given a SMN N , each aggregation D a of D , called a semantic mobility cuboid , is itself a graph. To the best of our knowledge, this modeling approach is novel for the mobility domain, since it has been studied only for non -spatial, vertex-specific multidimensional networks of traditional datatypes [26] . For a deeper comprehension of the above definitions, in Figure 5 we present another example demonstrating several novel operations/queries upon SMN. In particular, Figure 5(a) illustrates the sequence of the two 1-day semantic mobility timelines of Figure 3 , while Figure 5(b) presents their aggregate SMN, according to Definition 10. This time, the aggregation actually stands as a merging operation upon the SMNs of the two users. What is more, in Figure 5(c) we depict the SMN they have in common, relaxing the constraint that they should follow similar routes in order to be aggregated in the resulted SMN . The red sub-network in Figure 5(c) corresponds to the ir common SMN, where the space and time components of the two timelines have the same information. Continuing the example of Figure 5, in Figure 6 we adopt spatial hierarchies for interesting roll-up operations. Taking into account the spatial hierarchy illustrated in Figure 6(a) (implied by the black (first level) and grey (second level) dotted lines in Figure 3), in Figure 6(b) we present the rolled-up network from  X  X usiness district X  to  X  X hopping district X  . It is also interesting to note that such example operations can be extended by query operands registered in the SMD for progressive analysis purposes. For instance, after we  X  X xtract the mobility network of a user A during a period of time X  , we could  X  X estrict it at a particular region of interest X  , by using a range query. Assuming this network is at the base cuboid level, we could then join it with  X  X he aggregated (over a period of time) network of a set of users B (A X  X  friends and co-workers according to a social network) X  , as such B resides at a higher level in the lattice. The join result (which obviously is a novel cross-SMN operation) could identify the network of A wherein she performs same activities by following similar (or dissimilar) routes, or if a different representation is required, the common and/or frequent places, or paths. Even more challenging could be a query like the following:  X  X hich timelines ( or raw trajectories) conform to a given SMN, at any granularity level? X  , which is a cross-SMD/MOD-SMN operation. Given the above discussion, we introduce three additional types of queries : -Q4 ( ETL queries towards SMN ): queries extracting a SMN -Q5 ( SMN queries ; two variations): queries applying OLAP -Q6 ( SMN-SMD/MOD cross-over queries ; two variations): We argue that the above query types are interesting, not only due to their novelty but also due to the challenges they raise in database query processing and optimization terms. Although semantic mobility database management and analysis is still in its infancy, this article foresees some research directions that will very soon be considered as real requirements. Currently, we are working on the development of the described unified framework, which of course implies the invention of novel access methods and algorithms upon them. An interesting future direction is the exploitation of recent achievements in the field of complex networks regarding universal mobility laws [15] . More specifically, it is challenging to include these laws as measures in our SMN and evaluate them when performing OLAP operations on the SMC.
