 1. Introduction 1.1. Electronic journal and scholarly communication
Scholarly communication through electronic resources has attracted considerable attention. Electronic journals, among others, are particularly important. Several statistical reports have indicated an increase in the number of electronic journals. For example, the Ulrich X  X  Periodicals Directory database shows that 16,364 scientific refereed journals are active online in February 2005. This figure indicates about 1.5 times increase compared with the data for November 2003 ( Tenopir, 2004 ).

Seventy five percent of the major journals are available online according to the ALPSP survey ( Cox &amp; Cox, 2003 ). Similar facts have been reported by several other researches. An investigation by Morioka concerned the change from print to electronic in the journals on physics, psychology and the journals whose title begins with  X  X ournal of X  between 1998 and 2002. It shows that the proportion of journals in electronic version on physics increased from about 50% in 1998 to more than 80% in 2002 ( Morioka, 2005 ).

Usage of electronic journals by researchers has been reported through over 200 papers by 2003, according to Tenopir (2003) . Particularly important studies in this category, in terms of the diversity of approaches, have been performed by big projects such as SuperJournal and eJUSt. While the results of so many researches can-not be easily summarized, it is shown that the utilization of electronic journals, which had been negligible up to the early 1990s, then gradually increased, and the increase was accelerated after 2000. Data for 2002 and 2003 indicate that more than half of researchers (as many as 80% in some cases) use electronic journals at least once a week ( Mine, 2004 ).

However, it would be too simplistic to say, based on these data only, that scholarly communication is now fundamentally changed. In fact, the definition of  X  X lectronic journals X  varies in those reports: while the term meant relatively new, exclusively electronic journals up to the first half of the 1990s, it is now generally under-stood as online versions of traditional print journals. For example, Collins and Berge (1994, p. 774) , stated  X  X  X he biggest obstacle to e-journal is whether tenure committees will accept publication of an article in an e-journal as equivalent to publication in a print journal X  X . This  X  X lectronic journal X  means a new one. The rapid increase in utilization from the late 1990s is assumed to be most likely associated with the electronic versions of traditional journals. These two categories have different functions and roles in scholarly communication.
Kling and Callahan (2002) have identified four different types of electronic journals with different natures and functions, and criticized their confusion.

The form of existence (electronic files on web) and function (scholarly communication) of electronic jour-nals should be distinguished as contributing factors in their utilization, although hard to separate: is an elec-tronic journal read because it is in an electronic form or because it is a scholarly journal? It is important to identify what part of scholarly communication is made electronically, in what direction, and what, if anything, remains unchanged by the advent of the technology.

This article investigates the usage and views of scientific, technological and medical (STM) researchers on the traditional scholarly journals (both of print and electronic versions) as the core medium of scholarly com-munication, and attempts to identify the present situation and future direction. 1.2. Function of scholarly journals
Before summarizing the function of traditional scholarly journals, we confirm the significance of scholarly communication and researchers X  motivation for that. Science is a body of public knowledge,  X  X  X o which each research worker makes his personal contribution, and which is corrected and clarified by mutual criticism X  X  ( Ziman, 1976, p. 90 ). As it is a corporate activity, communication is the essence of science ( Garvey, 1979 ).
The scholarly journals have been considered to be the primary means for maintaining the communication between researchers for a long time.

Lambert (1985, p. 17) summarized the function of scholarly journals as follows: (1) to make public the ori-ginal results, (2) archive of research, (3) assignment of priority for scientists, (4) to ensure a guaranteed quality in the papers. Based on the concept on scientists X  norm, Meadows (1974, p. 36) indicated  X  X  X he primary impor-tance for priority claims in science of papers published in journals X  X . Although Garvey (1979, p. 69) claimed the significance of journal as recognition system, he also emphasized that scholarly journals are formal, and  X  X  X ublic both in the sense that anyone can submit a manuscript for publication and that they are available to anyone X  X .

Thus the fundamental characteristic of scholarly journals may be on the formal communication. This  X  X or-mal X  communication includes dual aspects: guaranteed quality (for evaluation) and widespread distribution (for communication). On the one hand, journal articles are  X  X ormal X  because they have the function of evalu-ation through peer review for publication. On the other hand, scholarly journals are  X  X ormal X  because they ensure the accessibility for most researchers through worldwide circulation by learned societies and commer-cial publishers, and permanent academic library collection. Collins and Berge (1994) also indicated  X  X  X eason for communication X  X  and  X  X  X riteria in the evaluation X  X  as the function of journal publication. Researchers as authors write articles for making their research results public, which establishes their priority and leads to their recognition or promotion. Researchers as readers utilize the published articles as reliable information sources for their work. Traditional scholarly journals have maintained the central position in scholarly communica-tion among many other forms including informal communication. The dual function is indispensable for research activity and will never vanish. The problem is how the form or the system of scholarly communica-tion has been and is being changed by the electronic resources.

The authors examine in this article possibilities of partial replacement of the dual function of scholarly jour-nals by other electronic resources, or, in other words, whether scholarly journals have changed their position in the behavior and consciousness of researchers. If the position has not changed, another question is to what extent electronic journals have advanced and what effects they have brought about; more specifically, how they affect the traditional scholarly communication system involving large publishers and academic libraries. 1.3. From print to electronic resources
In print era, scholarly journals have been almost the only platform through which peer-reviewed articles have been disseminated. As a result of Internet penetration, researchers can use e-print archives or author X  X  websites besides the electronic versions of scholarly journals to access articles. But the studies surveying actual circumstance are not so many. To clarify the place of scholarly journals in electronic era, two aspects should been examined: (1) a comparison between usage of electronic journals and other electronic resources such as e-print archive or institutional repositories, (2) a shift from print to electronic versions of traditional scholarly journals in researchers X  usage.

Dillon and Hahn (2002) investigated the frequency of usage of scholarly journals (both of print and elec-tronic versions), and other electronic format use to read. They reported that the 51% of faculty used electronic versions of print journals at least once a month, and also regularly used a wide range of other sources (pro-fessional organizations X  websites were used by 36% of respondents, conference proceedings were used by 28%, and author X  X  websites were used by 21%). According to a recent survey, astronomers have been relying heavily on electronic resources (about 80% of their readings are from electronic resources). They use not only elec-tronic journals but also ADS archive (26% of readings) and electronic preprints (19% of readings) ( Tenopir, King, Boyce, Grayson, &amp; Paulson, 2005 ).

While the evolution of utilization of electronic resources was reported, researchers in other disciplines than physics have not used e-print archives ( ALPSP, 2002; Brown, 2003 ). These differences in utilization of elec-tronic resources may be determined by many complex factors. Thus we should confirm the concrete and detailed utilization of electronic resources (both electronic versions of scholarly journals and other electronic resources such as e-print archive, authors X  websites, and so on).

Many studies have been made on the utilization of electronic versions of scholarly journals, but only a few have addressed to what extent and how print versions have been used. Siebenberg, Galbraith, and Brady (2004) compared utilization in 1998 and 2001 of print-only journals and journals that also have electronic ver-sions. While a general increase in use in that period was identified, it was not fully accounted for by the elec-tronic versions; not all the print-only publications were declining, and not all journals with electronic versions made progress. Another article reports that 70% of the faculty members were using both printed and electronic forms of core scholarly journals ( Dillon &amp; Hahn, 2002 ). These research findings indicated that researchers still use both print and electronic versions of scholarly journals.
The present work is intended to identify changes (or absence of changes) in the place of scholarly journals, using factual data on the researchers X  usage and views of them. A focus of interest is whether the needs for access to information and recognition (and evaluation) of research results are still met largely by scholarly journals or increasingly by other electronic resources. In addition, comparisons are made of the modes of utilization of print and electronic versions of scholarly journals on the one hand, and of the electronic versions of scholarly journals and other electronic resources on the other, to clarify the relative importance of each. Researchers X  evaluations and views on electronic resources and scholarly communication conclude the article. 2. Scholarly communication systems in Japan
Prior to reporting the results of the survey, this section summarizes the situation experienced by Japanese researchers with respect to publication of research results and access to information. 2.1. Research publication and scholarly journals in Japan
A conspicuous feature of Japanese scholarly communication is that scholarly journals have been solely pub-lished by professional societies. While subsidiaries of Nature Group or Reed Elsevier are located in the coun-try, local commercial publishers offer no scholarly journals. About a thousand professional societies exist in the Japanese STM fields which publish over 2000 peer-reviewed journals in total, of which about 350 are in English.

Circulation of the print journals is practically limited to within Japan, though a few exceptional societies have their journals published by foreign commercial companies to facilitate circulation outside the country.
Japanese researchers may publish their articles either in the journal issued by the Japanese society they belong to, or in an internationally known American or European journal of their field. In fact, a recent statistical review shows that 80% of the articles written by Japanese researchers are published in foreign major journals and articles by Japanese account for 12% of articles in major American and European journals ( Adachi et al., 2003 ).

The present survey conducted in 2003 on Japanese researchers suggests that they are primarily concerned to publish their research articles in journals of worldwide reputation, regardless of the nationality of the publish-ers, as are researchers in western countries. 2.2. Systems for accessing information
Since the end of World War II, acquiring and providing scientific and technological information abroad have always been an important task of Japanese academic libraries and the National Diet Library. They were generally successful: in the 1980s when the American libraries were suffering the  X  X  X erials crisis X  X , academic libraries in Japan were increasing their purchase of foreign journals, supported by the strong yen, in spite of price hikes of American and European journals and discriminatory pricing. Tutiya (2004) characterizes this period as an expanding phase of the Japanese academic libraries. In the 1990s, however, a decline in the Jap-anese economy translated into tight budgets in the libraries. At the same time that they had to deal with the advent of electronic journals, they began cutting the number of titles purchased from foreign countries. The decrease proceeded surreptitiously until the relevant data were published in 1999 and revealed that the total number of titles subscribed to by all academic libraries had been halved in ten years. Subscriptions to elec-tronic journals were dangerously few except for a limited number of exceptionally well-endowed libraries. The general recognition of this crisis resulted in a series of events, including a proposal by the Science Council of Japan on the acquisition policy of academic libraries, subsidization programs by the Ministry of
Education and Science, and Elsevier X  X  free offering program for electronic journals, which accelerated the introduction of electronic journals in academic libraries. Epoch-making progress was made when a task force in the Japan Association of National University Libraries established a consortium for group purchasing of electronic journals. The consortium has enabled substantially all of the national university libraries to intro-duce electronic journals. However, private university libraries have greater difficulties. Data from a survey shows that, in January 2004 (i.e. a year after the one featured in this article), more than half of the small-and middle-sized libraries of private universities had no electronic journals, while 95% of the respondents from the national university libraries reported that they offer over 1000 titles in electronic journals. The situation in large-scale private universities is better: 60% of them have access to 1000 X 2999 electronic titles, with some offering more than 5000 ( Toshimori, Uda, &amp; Matsubayashi, 2004 ).

Our survey was conducted in March 2003 when the environment of the electronic journal service was turn-ing favorable and, as described later, the selected respondents seemed to have access to major electronic jour-nals in their fields to a considerable extent. 3. Method
A questionnaire was sent to researchers in physics, chemistry and pathology in universities and other research institutes all over Japan. At first, 70 universities that have relevant departments were identified for physicists and chemists, and 78 with departments of medicine for pathologists. Secondly, the NACSIS-IR
Directory of Researchers provided by the National Institute of Informatics was used for identifying all the researchers whose specialty is any of those three disciplines. The physicists comprised specialists in solid state physics, materials science, etc; chemists those in physical/organic/inorganic chemistry, materials conversion and others; pathologists those in human pathology, experimental pathology, etc. Thus we undertook complete enumeration of researchers who belong to any of these universities or other institutes.

Care was taken to avoid regional bias in selecting the universities. Physicists and chemists in national labo-ratories were included. Researchers in junior colleges, higher technical colleges or non-national research insti-tutions were excluded along with graduate students. Considering the total number of 700 plus of four-year universities and colleges in Japan, the scale of the target universities was considerably large; it may be regarded as representing major institutions in the country.

The questionnaire contained 21 questions 1 concerning: (1) the categories and quantity of articles read, and the purpose of reading, (2) mode of obtaining and reading articles, and changes, if any, before and after the introduction of electronic journals, (3) usage of electronic journals, (4) the present situation of publishing arti-cles in scholarly journals, whether submitting them to other electronic resources or not, and (5) views on the future of scholarly communication (including free statements).

The questionnaire was mailed to 1427 physicists, 1026 chemists and 1276 pathologists, of which 775 (54.3%), 494 (48.1%) and 541 (42.4%), respectively, supplied answers by the end of March. Answers were also accepted via the Internet.

There was an even spread in the status of pathologists while professors were the most numerous among physicists and chemists, followed by assistant professors, the two accounting for more than 60% of the respon-dents. The age distribution was approximately uniform in a range of 30 X 60 in all three fields.
Section 4 below represents and analyzes the response data in terms of changes in information sources for researchers. Section 5 deals with the views and behavior of researchers in publishing their research results. Section 6 presents the researchers X  expectations of the scholarly communication system in the future. Finally,
Section 7 summarizes the results and discusses the role of journals in scholarly communication. 4. Scholarly journals and other electronic resources 4.1. Electronic resources other than scholarly journals
Development of electronic resources has offered a wider selection of information sources for researchers. In addition to the print journals, traditionally the unique medium for peer-reviewed articles, one has now access to the websites of individual researchers or research organizations and open access archives.
It is clear that most researchers regard scholarly journal articles, either in the printed or electronic form, as the primary information source. Table 1 shows the formats of articles read by researchers. We asked them  X  X  X hich formats do you regularly use when you read articles? X  X 
Usage of other electronic resources remains modest but some changes are anticipated in physics and pathol-ogy: the table indicates that 29.7% of the physicists use  X  X  X -print archives X  X , and 27.2% of the pathologists use chemists rely very little on other electronic resources, such as e-print archives and the websites of research institutes.

These trends are in accordance with the researchers X  views on other electronic resources comparable to scholarly journals. The answers for the query on  X  X  X o you think any of the following electronic resources are comparable to scholarly journals for getting scholarly information? X  X  are shown in Table 2 .
In the field of physics,  X  X  X -print archives X  X  marked 41.3%, compared with 24.7% for  X  X  X othing comparable X  X  and, in pathology,  X  X  X rticles on universities X  or institutions X  websites X  X  marked 35.6%, which nearly equaled 39.1% for  X  X  X othing comparable X  X , while 39.5% for  X  X  X othing comparable X  X  in chemistry was much higher than other alternatives. This means that those other electronic resources which are relatively favored as shown in
Table 1 are evaluated as equivalent to scholarly journals, while other electronic resources are largely ignored as information sources by the chemists.

These results indicate that scholarly journals remain the most important source of research articles as they were before the introduction of electronic resources for scholarly communication. Meanwhile, recognition of the effectiveness of some electronic resources in physics and pathology suggests that scholarly communication is gradually changing, but at different speeds in different research fields. 4.2. Changes in accessing scholarly journals and articles
Other electronic resources have so far had little impact on scholarly communication, with scholarly journals still remaining in the central position. This section focuses on the usage by researchers of the printed and elec-tronic versions of scholarly journals. 4.2.1. Usage of electronic journals and print journals  X  X  X very day X  X  use of electronic journals was reported by 15.0% of the physicists, 19.5% of the chemists and 24.8% of the pathologists. The corresponding values for  X  X  X bout once a week X  X  were 40.4%, 45.5% and 37.0%, respectively ( Fig. 1 ). These figures indicate a considerable advance of electronic journals in all of the fields: 55.4% (physics) to 65.0% (chemistry) of the respondents read electronic journals at least once a week, includ-ing as much as 25%  X  X  X very day X  X  readers in pathology.

When cross-tabulating the frequency of use according to age, research style, position, only age was statis-tically significantly associated with the frequency of use ( p &lt; 0.01). In physics and chemistry, younger research-ers use the electronic journals more frequently than older researchers. In pathology, however, the researchers of 40s use the electronic journals most frequently, and next 30s, 50s, 60s. It is not clear why the researchers of 30s use the electronic journals less than those of 40s.

Expansion of electronic journals is also indicated by Table 1 . About 70% of the researchers said they read articles in an electronic form (71.3% of the physicists, 73.0% of the chemists, 69.7% of the pathologists). It should be noted, however, that the advance of electronic journals does not mean print journals are in disfavor.
Table 1 shows that readers of print journals account for an overwhelming 92.5% of the chemists and 91.6% of the pathologists.

Physicists seem to be somewhat less enthusiastic, but still prefer the printed form (78.2%) to electronic jour-nals (71.3%). Of the electronic journal readers, 75.4% of the physicists, 91.0% of the chemists and 91.4% of the pathologists reported that they read printed versions also. This means that many read journals in both printed and electronic forms. The lower proportion of usage of printed versions for the physicists (25% of them do not read printed versions) suggest a shift to electronic forms, though at a very slow rate. 4.2.2. Changes in the pattern of obtaining journal articles
The present questionnaire included a question on  X  X  X ow were journal articles read before and after the elec-tronic journals were introduced? X  X  The most frequent pattern before the introduction of electronic journals was copying from print journals (89.4% of the physicists, 81.8% of the chemists, 82.4% of the pathologists). Before electronic journals, about 90% of the respondents read separate copies of print journals.

Then, the most frequent pattern after the introduction of electronic journals was downloading and printing out PDF files (68.0% of the physicists, 60.1% of the chemists and 55.4% of the pathologists). The second was copying from print journals, which accounted for only 17.4%, 21.2% and 22.8%, respectively. Relatively few researchers (about 10% or less) read electronic journal articles on their desktop (in HTML or PDF format).
The low usage of HTML files, in spite of reference facilitated by hyperlinks, suggests that researchers retain their traditional reading habits, though utilizing electronic tools.
 The change of patterns in reading was categorized before and after the introduction of electronic journals. Thus, there were 10 patterns which were described as arrow  X  X  X  X  X  to arrow  X  X  X  X  X  in Fig. 2 .

The introduction of electronic journals caused some changes for about 75% of the respondents (arrows b X  X , h X  X  in Fig. 2 ), but no changes for the remaining 25% (arrows a and g in Fig. 2 ), in any of the three fields. About 30 X 40% of those who used to read print journals did not change their behavior (29.6% of the physicists, 41.7% of the chemists and 45.7% of the pathologists). In contrast, only about 20% of the respondents who usually read separate copies of articles kept their habit (19.0% of the physicists, 24.4% of the chemists and 26.7% of the pathologists), and more than 80% of them (85.7% of the physicists, 86.6% of the chemists and 82.3% of the pathologists) shifted to downloading PDF files.

In short, the changes due to the introduction of electronic journals are mostly accounted for by the shift from separate copy to downloading and printing a PDF file. This change seems to be a continuum of the way of reading the scholarly journals before the introduction of the electronic journals.

Tenopir and King (2000) points out that many researchers gave up personal subscription to scholarly jour-nals in the mid-1980s, and came to order separate copies of articles from libraries. As many researchers had already shifted to separate copies, they came to download and print out PDF files when electronic journals were introduced. 4.3. Changes in behavior pattern
We examined any changes in the behavior patterns caused by the introduction of electronic journals by ask-ing: (1) if any personal subscription to a journal was given up, (2) if library use (perusal, copying, etc.) decreased, (3) if the connect time to the web increased, and (4) if the number of articles read increased.
The responses indicated that the frequency of library use and the connect time to the web saw considerable changes: 78.3% of the physicists, 70.8% of the chemists and 72.6% of the pathologists indicated less frequent visits to their libraries, while 84.5%, 89.6% and 79.9%, respectively, reported increased web access. The fre-quency of library use and the connect time to the web were both statistically significantly associated with the frequency of using electronic journals in every research area ( p &lt; 0.01).

Some change was also observed in the number of articles read: increase was reported by 33.8% of the phys-icists, 35.9% of the chemists, and 41.0% of the pathologists. The last group represents an almost equal ratio to those who reported no increase (43.3%), suggesting an incipient transition. The number of articles read was area. It is not clear why the result shows such a tendency.

Little change was seen in personal subscription to journals. Only about 20% of the respondents (21.1% of the physicists, 22.2% of the chemists and 27.5% of the pathologists) had given up their subscriptions. The per-sonal subscription to journals was statistically significantly associated with the frequency of using journals in chemistry and pathology ( p &lt; 0.01), but not in physics. Thus, the enhanced accessibility of research articles provided by electronic journals does not mean a decline in personal subscription to journals. 5. Scholarly journals as the vehicle of publication
Following the discussion above of the changes related to information access, this section deals with the effects of electronic resources on the other aspect of scholarly communication: publication of research results. 5.1. Scholarly journals and other media as publication platforms
Electronic resources have added many options of publication platforms other than scholarly journals that were once the only possibility. Today, universities, research institutes and even individual researchers have their own websites. There exist servers for preprints and/or conference articles. These resources can in theory serve as publication platforms for research reports/results.

Scholarly journals are by far the most important publication route for more than 70% of the respondents, who submit at least 60% of their results to journals. Fig. 3 shows the submission rates of research results. We asked them  X  X  X o you always submit your research results to journals? X  X  In particular, researchers who always submit research results account for 31.5% (pathologists) to 41.4% (physicists), the latter group representing the highest proportion in this category. Those who submit them rarely to journals were only 2 X 3%. Scholarly jour-nals are thus apparently the most familiar publication route for researchers.

We asked the researchers who submit articles to scholarly journals  X  X  X o you make your research results available on your websites regularly? X  X  As a result, some chemists and pathologists reported making full-text of articles on the websites of their institutions, but their proportion was only about 5%. Physicists were an exception: 19.5% of them were making their results available on the e-print archives, which are therefore active as publication platforms. Such researchers who hardly submit articles to journals are few in number, and most of them present their results at conferences including poster sessions rather than on other electronic resources.
Thus, scholarly journals remain as practically the sole platform for publishing research results in spite of the availability of other electronic resources. Although the e-print archives are actually used by physicists, sug-gesting a possibility of other electronic resources, their importance still falls behind journals. Furthermore, the e-print archive users are also contributors to journals, and therefore have no intention of giving up the tradi-tional publication route. 5.2. Why scholarly journals?
A question was asked on the reason why journals are chosen as the publishing platform in order to discern any effects of electronic resources on researchers X  behavior in this respect.

In the field of physics, the top answer was  X  X  X ecause only journal articles are counted as my achievement X  X  with 46.5%, followed by 43.1% for  X  X  X ecause scholarly journals are most likely to be read by many X  X . The cor-responding figures for the chemists were 45.6% and 45.4%, respectively. These two answers gained about the same number of respondents, suggesting that researchers regard contribution to journals as the best means for circulation of their research results as well as for ensuring their evaluation. For the pathologists, however, the first answer got 53.2% while the second got only 38.2%, suggesting that they are more interested in the func-tion of journals for evaluation of achievements ( Table 3 ).

The impact factor was by far the most important among journal selection criteria, the proportion ranging from 63.9% for the physicists to 82.3% for the pathologists. The second was  X  X  X ontribution to Nature or Sci-ence X  X  by 66.8% of the pathologists and 56.9% of the chemists, considerably lower proportions than for the impact factor. Only the physicists chose  X  X  X ontribution to journals highly appreciated by experts X  X  as the second criterion (63.0%, very close to the top).

Some difference between fields notwithstanding, evaluation of achievements is evidently the major concern among researchers, which determines their interest in the impact factor or reputation of journals (as is the case for Nature and Science). Since this tendency had already been noted before the introduction of electronic jour-nals, it is concluded that the predominance of journals as a publication platform has not been affected by elec-tronic resources. 6. Researchers X  views on scholarly communication in future
Researchers X  views are important in forecasting the future of scholarly communication. The survey explored their thoughts on the importance of various aspects of scholarly journals ( Fig. 4 ), as well as on the future of scholarly communication ( Table 4 ).

The greatest importance was attached to  X  X  X emi-permanent accessibility to back numbers X  X  (by 80.5% of the physicists, 78.7% of the chemists and 71.5% of the pathologists). The  X  X  X eer review system X  X  followed with 72.9% of the physicists and 61.1% of the chemists. For the pathologists, the second most important aspect was  X  X 24-hour-a-day accessibility X  X  (64.3%), followed by the  X  X  X eer review system X  X  (56.9%).

Apparently, while appreciating the increased accessibility of electronic journals, researchers are getting more concerned about its permanence. One respondent commented that he was not sure if electronic records would remain accessible after 10 or 50 years. This problem had not been felt before the introduction of elec-tronic journals, and now attracts more attention than the peer review system, one of the fundamental features of scholarly journals.

A further question about predicted states of scholarly communication after five years elicited responses as shown in Table 4 .

About 40% of the respondents believed that most journals are likely to be available in both electronic and printed versions, as they are today (36.8% of the physicists, 42.5% of the chemists and 41.6% of the pathol-ogists). These figures may reflect researchers X  reluctance to shift completely to electronic journals because of the uncertain accessibility as mentioned above.  X  X  X lectronic free access to all scholarly journal articles, pro-ceedings and preprints through central portal site X  X  was expected by 20 X 30% of the respondents (29.4% of the physicists, 21.9% of the chemists and 25.9% of the pathologists). These relatively low figures also suggest that a quick and complete shift from printed to electronic resources is unlikely. However, these answers, added to those predicting the predominance of electronic resources, account for about half of the respondents (54.9% of the physicists, 49.9% of the chemists and 52.1% of the pathologists), suggesting that researchers have begun to accept electronic resources, even though gradually. 7. Discussion 7.1. The position of electronic version of scholarly journals from the viewpoint of researcher X  X  usage pattern
In summary, the present survey demonstrates that electronic resources have not affected the general pre-dominance of scholarly journals as the publication platform and information source. Very few respondents have given up submitting articles to scholarly journals, and other electronic resources remain minor as pub-lication routes. The position of scholarly journals as the publication platform does not change at all. Self-archiving, as recommended in the open access movement, was practiced in Japan by only about five percent of researchers in 2003, except for physicists, about 20% of whom utilize the preprint server arXiv.
The position of scholarly journals as the information source has some changes, compared with that as the publication platform. For example, 30% of researchers use other electronic resources such as arXiv or insti-tutional websites. The frequency of use of other electronic resources, however, is less than that of electronic versions of scholarly journals. 70% of researchers use electronic versions of scholarly journals.
The reason for the definite difference in use between electronic versions of scholarly journals and other elec-tronic resources is that the researchers can hardly have a motive for using other electronic resources because the scholarly journals continue to be the main information source in scholarly communication.

Moreover, it seems that the shift from print to electronic versions of scholarly journals came with no dif-ficulty. These changes in behavior seem to be a partial modification of the existing behavior patterns. That is, electronic versions of scholarly journals are provided for researchers by the academic libraries just like the print versions of scholarly journals, and the downloading of PDF files has simply replaced copies made from print versions of scholarly journals in libraries. In other words, the electronic versions of scholarly journals have become popular only because they facilitate copying articles in the traditional framework. This is also the reason why entirely new electronic resources have not yet advanced to any significant extent. 7.2. Changes of researchers X  views for the function of scholarly journals
Researchers X  usage patterns of information resources have not so much changed, thus scholarly journals continue to have a privileged position. Electronic versions of traditional journals, however, have apparently stimulated some changes in researchers X  views on scholarly journals and other electronic resources. One is the recognition for the strength of scholarly journals as the total system, and another one is the acceptance of electronic resources.

Of the concerns about scholarly journals in the future, the greatest was ensuring semi-permanent accessi-bility, which attracted the attention of about 80% of the respondents, rather than the peer review system. In print versions, semi-permanent accessibility has automatically been guaranteed because academic libraries not only provide them but also store them (including back issues). Semi-permanent accessibility for electronic ver-sion, however, is not guaranteed by anyone yet. For example, the response in free answer section makes men-tion of the semi-permanent accessibility.  X  X  X  do not think that in fifty years we will read electronic journals in the same format now X  X . Comments like this in free answer section reflect fears for the weakness of electronic resources which are not only technological aspect but also as social system. In many literatures that have dis-cussed the function of scholarly journal, the peer review system or the evaluation function may be referred as the most important. By the advent of the electronic versions, researchers may recognize again the strength of scholarly journals as the total system.

On the other hand, our research results may indicate an acceptance of the shift from print to electronic ver-sions of scholarly journals. Although there are several responses in free answer section indicating the effect of browsing or serendipity in print versions, many researchers regarded an electronic version as very convenient services.

About 40% of the respondents predicted that the present situation of scholarly communication would not be significantly changed after five years. However, more than half believed in the eventual predominance of electronic resources in some form or other. Central portal sites providing all research articles and preprints were the most highly supported idea. This is similar to the centralized archives model targeted by NIH through
PubMed Central in the open access movements, though no specific plan existed at the time of the survey, nor was the concept of open access well known among researchers. Researchers may have no longer prejudice in favor of print versions.

Thus researchers X  acceptance of electronic versions may also reflect the hope of improving the accessibility of scholarly journals. This accessibility means not only for new articles but also for the whole of knowledge in the field. The scholarly journals have substantiated the social system for providing the repository of the body of knowledge, and maintaining the record of the progress of science, which including learned society, publish-ers, academic libraries, universities, and researchers. It is assumed that researchers would like to realize the strength of scholarly journals as the total system in electronic realm. In other words, a new model of electronic scholarly communication that guarantees semi-permanent accessibility to peer-reviewed articles would be accepted by researchers.
 8. Conclusion
In this paper, the position of electronic journals in scholarly communication has been discussed based on the survey for the views and utilization by Japanese researchers in scientific, technological, and medical dis-ciplines. The sample of the survey is selected researchers in physics, chemistry and pathology in universities and other research institutes all over Japan and of which 50% or thereabout supplied answers. So that it is presumed that the results of the survey reflect the common view and utilization by the researchers in Japan.
From the viewpoints of the utilization, Japanese researchers continue to use the scholarly journals as pub-lication platform and information sources. They use electronic versions of scholarly journals as a matter of course and other electronic resources to some extent for accessing information. This shift to electronic resources, however, seems to be not a transformation but a modification of traditional use patterns. Research-ers still rely on traditional scholarly journals for accessing and publication.

From the Japanese researchers X  views, it may be concluded that they accept the shift to electronic resources inevitably. The concern for the semi-permanent accessibility of electronic resources, however, exists simultaneously.

Scholarly journals occupy the privileged position in the scholarly communication. Whether this  X  X cholarly journal X  system will be transformed or not by the progress of digitization is not clear. A continuous investi-gation will be necessary to see the transition of researchers X  views and utilization of scholarly journals.
