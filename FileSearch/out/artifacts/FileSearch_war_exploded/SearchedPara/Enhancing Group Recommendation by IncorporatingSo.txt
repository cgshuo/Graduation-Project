 Group recommendation, which makes recommendations to a group of users instead of individuals, has become increas-ingly important in both the workspace and people X  X  social activities, such as brainstorming sessions for coworkers and social TV for family members or friends. Group recommen-dation is a challenging problem due to the dynamics of group memberships and diversity of group members. Previous work focused mainly on the content interests of group mem-bers and ignored the social characteristics within a group, re-sulting in suboptimal group recommendation performance.
In this work, we propose a group recommendation method that utilizes both social and content interests of group mem-bers. We study the key characteristics of groups and pro-pose (1) a group consensus function that captures the so-cial, expertise, and interest dissimilarity among multiple group members; and (2) a generic framework that automat-ically analyzes group characteristics and constructs the cor-responding group consensus function. Detailed user studies of diverse groups demonstrate the effectiveness of the pro-posed techniques, and the importance of incorporating both social and content interests in group recommender systems.

We are quickly moving into a digital society. As more in-formation is generated every day and more people become digitally connected, group recommender systems, which make suggestions to a group of people, have become increasingly important. Group recommendation can be targeted at very different scenarios, different groups and different types of items. For instance, a group recommender system may be used to suggest TV programs to a family, movies to a group of friends, music at a social event, or brainstorming top-ics among coworkers. Effective group recommendation can therefore have a positive impact on both people X  X  work per-formance and social activities.

Group recommendation is a challenging problem, due to the dynamics and diversity of groups. A group may be formed at any time by an arbitrary number of people with diverse interests, and the same person may participate in multiple groups of different nature, e.g., a coworker group vs. a family group. An effective group recommender sys-tem needs to capture not only the preferences of individ-ual group members, but also the key factors in the group decision process, i.e., how a group of people reaches a con-sensus. The problem of individual-based recommendation has been extensively studied and a number of techniques have been proposed [5, 26, 21, 12, 19]. More recently, re-searchers have started investigating the problem of group recommendation [25, 8, 35, 11, 33, 30, 13, 18]. They pro-pose solutions that either create a  X  X seudo-user X  profile for each group, or merge the recommendation lists of individual users at runtime using different group decision strategies, such as average satisfaction, minimum misery, or maximum satisfaction. The dissimilarity among group members has also been studied [8]. These techniques focus mainly on the content interests of group members and do not consider the social relationships among group members.

Givenagroupofpeoplewithdiverseinterests,tomakea decision on which item(s) (e.g., movie, TV program, restau-rant) to choose, we need to consider not only the dissimi-larity among the group members, but more importantly, the weights (i.e., importance or influence) of individual members within this group. Instead of assuming equal weights of all the members, we want to identify members who are more influential and can  X  X ersuade X  others to agree with him/her. In other words, the social characteristics of a group and its members play an important role in the group decision pro-cess. For example, intuition suggests that a more uniform or equal social group would tend to make democratic deci-sions, i.e., maximizing average satisfaction, while a group of strangers with weak social ties would, out of politeness, try to avoid choosing items that are disliked by at least one of the members, i.e., minimizing maximum misery.

To capture these types of influences, in this work, we pro-pose a group recommendation solution that incorporates both social and content interest information to generate consensus among a group (the group consensus function ), thereby identifying items that are most suitable for a group. Our work makes the following contributions:
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We sur-vey related work in Section 2. Section 3 gives an overview of the group recommender system and discusses the three most common group decision making strategies. Section 4 discusses the group characteristics that impact the group de-cision process, presents in detail the proposed group consen-sus function, and describes the framework for automatically analyzing groups and generating the corresponding group consensus function. Section 5 discusses the user studies we have conducted and performance of the proposed techniques. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses some of our future work.
In this work, we investigate the problem of group recom-mendation and propose consensus functions that integrate both content and social characteristics of group members. This work is closely related to recommender systems in gen-eral and in particular, group-based recommendation.
Recommender systems have been an area of active re-search since the mid-1990s [27, 17, 29, 16, 5]. A number of recommendation techniques have been proposed, ranging from content-based similarity analysis, to collaborative fil-tering and hybrid recommendation techniques. These tech-niques target various real-world recommendation needs, such as identifying interesting web sites [26], Amazon X  X  product recommendation [21], Google X  X  news personalization [12], and Netflix X  X  movie recommendation [19]. The work by Liu and Maes [23] also considers individual users X  social network profiles and uses an interest map to identify interconnect-ing interests and identities for recommendation. All these techniques focus on making recommendations for individual users and do not consider the problem of group recommen-dation. This line of research is complementary to our work, and state-of-the-art recommendation techniques for individ-ual users can be easily integrated into our solution.
The problem of group recommendation has also been in-vestigated recently [25, 8, 35, 11, 33, 30, 13, 18]. Various techniques have been proposed, targeting different types of recommendation items (e.g., movie, TV program, music) and different groups (e.g., family, friends, dynamic social groups). For instance, the PartyVote [30] system provides a simple democratic mechanism for selecting and playing mu-sic at social events, i.e., each group member is guaranteed to have at least one of his/her preferred songs played. This mechanism is not practical when only one or a few items can be recommended, e.g., movies or TV programs. Vild-jiounaite et al. present a family-based TV program recom-mender system that makes recommendations based on the view history of each household, instead of combining the TV preferences of individual family members [33]. This method assumes static family groups and does not work for dynamic groups, e.g., just parents or a random social group.
Most group recommendation techniques consider the pref-erences of individual users and propose different strategies to either combine the individual user profiles into a single group profile (i.e., a pseudo user) and make recommendations for the pseudo user, or generate recommendation lists for in-dividual group members and merge the lists for group rec-ommendation. Jameson and Smyth summarize three main strategies for merging individual recommendations: aver-age satisfaction, minimum misery, and maximum satisfac-tion [18]. Average satisfaction, which assumes equal impor-tance across all group members, is used in several group recommender systems [36, 35, 11]. Besides using the av-erage satisfaction strategy, Berkovsky et al. suggest using different weights (e.g., weights of family members) in the aggregation models [10]. However, we are not aware if the weight-based strategy has been investigated. Other stud-ies have compared the three aggregation strategies [13, 24, 8]. Based on a user study of two 3-member groups, Mas-thoff suggests that both average satisfaction and minimum misery are plausible candidates for group decisions. Recent work by Amer-Yahia et al. propose a consensus function that utilizes not only the average satisfaction and minimum misery strategies, but also the dissimilarity among group members [8]. However, the consensus function does not take other factors that may affect a group decision into consid-eration. O X  X onnor et al. have developed PolyLens, a group-based movie recommender [25]. While the PolyLens system targets small, private, and persistent groups, they have also investigated several group characteristics, including the na-ture of groups, rights of group members, social value func-tions, and interfaces for displaying group recommendations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that for-mally utilizes both social and content interests for the group consensus function and group recommender systems.
In this section, we first present the architectural design of our group recommender system, highlighting the role of the group consensus function. Next, we review the most common group decision making strategies. Based on our analysis of group characteristics and how they impact the group decision making process as described in Section 4.1, we then propose a new group consensus function in Sec-tion 4.2 and a generic framework for automatic generation of group consensus functions in Section 4.3.
Group recommender systems are usually designed using one of two architectures. In the first architecture, a  X  X seudo user X  profile is generated from all group members, and an individual-based recommender system is then used at run-time to generate recommendations for the X  X seudo user X , i.e., the group. This approach generally has good efficiency but does not work well for dynamic groups. In the second ar-chitecture, an individual-based recommender system is first used to generate recommendations for each group member, then a group consensus function is used to merge the individ-ual recommendations and select ones that are most suitable for the whole group.
 In this work we adopt the second architecture, as shown in Figure 1), i.e., individual-based recommendation plus group consensus function. By considering the recommendations for individual group members and merging them at run-time to generate group recommendations, this group rec-ommender system architecture can easily accommodate dy-namic groups and tailor its recommendations for each spe-cific scenarios. In addition, the use of group consensus func-tion makes it easy to incorporate various group characteris-tics that can potentially impact the group decision process. In this group recommender system architecture, our work focuses on the design of the group consensus function. Var-ious individual-based recommender systems can be easily adopted into our architecture.
Over the past decades, a variety of group decision strate-gies have been devised. One of the key purposes of inves-tigating group decision strategies is to understand how a group of individuals reach a consensus, i.e., given individual preferences for an item, how does the group come up with a decision for the item? To illustrate this, we review the three most common group decision strategies, including average satisfaction , minimum misery ,and maximum satisfaction .
Average Satisfaction: The most straightforward group decision strategy is to assume equal importance among all group members and compute the average satisfaction of the whole group for any given item. Let n be the number of users in a group, r i,j be the rating of user j for item i , then the group rating for item i is computed as follows: Table 1 illustrates an example where the group preference for two di ff erent types of movies is consistent with the average satisfaction (rating) of its group members.

Minimum Misery: Computing the average satisfaction within a group, though simple and straightforward, may not always be desirable. This happens when one or a few mem-bers really dislike an item, but their low ratings for this item may be averaged out by higher ratings by other group members. For example, Mike and Tom gave very di ff erent ratings to two horror movies (see Table 2). Tom really dis-likes horror movies and gave these two movies the lowest 1-star rating, whereas these two horror movies are accept-able for Mike. To please the least happy member (i.e., Tom in our example), the final decision of the group is to rate each movie using the movie X  X  lowest rating among its group members, i.e., minimum misery:
Maximum Satisfaction: In some scenarios, a group may choose to rate an item using the highest rating among its group members. This happens when one or a few group members really like an item and the remaining group mem-bers either agree or have reasonable satisfaction. As shown in Table 3, Tom is highly interested in the Harry Potter movies and these movies are acceptable for Mike. There-fore, the final decision of the group may reflect the highest rating within the group:
While the three group decision strategies described above are most commonly used, none of them is dominant across all groups [24]. It is unclear which group decision strategy should be applied under what specific group characteristics. Next, we analyze in detail the di ff erent group characteristics and how they lead to di ff erent group consensus functions.
Based on the group recommender system architecture and the three base group decision strategies, we propose a group recommendation solution that fills the gap between specific group characteristics and the dominant group decision strat-egy. Specifically, our solution consists of three key compo-nents: (a) group descriptors that capture social, expertise, and dissimilarity information of a group; (b) a heuristic-based group consensus function; and (c) a rule-based generic framework that automatically generates the most suitable group consensus function for a group.
As discussed above, di ff erent group decision strategies may be used, such as average satisfaction, minimum misery, and maximum satisfaction. However, groups are diverse in na-ture and no single group decision strategy works best for all groups. To address this issue, we need to identify the inherent characteristics of di ff erent groups and determine their specific impacts on the group decision process. In this work, we investigate three crucial factors that may a ff ect a group X  X  decision and quantify these three factors as the following group descriptors: social descriptor, expertise de-scriptor, and dissimilarity descriptor.

Social Descriptor: We first investigate how the social factor a ff ects a group X  X  decision. A group consists of two or more individuals who are either directly or indirectly con-nected to each other by some social relationships. Since they interact with and influence each other, the group decision is The Matrix 3 5 4 Star Wars 4 4 4 Table 1: Average satisfaction Forrest Gump 5 3 5 affected by the strength of the social relationships. To illus-trate this, let us consider the following examples. Suppose a couple  X  Nicole and Tom 1  X  want to select a movie to watch together. The movie preferences for each of them and the movie preferences for the couple (group) are listed in Table 4. An interesting observation is that the couple X  X  fi-nal decision matches perfectly with the decision generated by the maximum satisfaction strategy. Table 5 shows a dif-ferent example. In this case, two acquaintances  X  Tom and John  X  have the same movie preferences as the couple. How-ever, the final decision that the acquaintances make is more likely to correspond with the final decision generated by the average satisfaction strategy. Intuitively, the difference be-tween the two groups is the strength of their social relation-ships. Consequently, we believe that the social relationship strength of a group should be taken into consideration in the group decision process.

The social descriptor is devised to measure the social re-lationship strength of a group. Intuitively, a husband-and-wife family group usually has tighter and stronger social relationship than a group of people who are merely acquain-tances. For a two-member group, its social relationship can be easily defined as the strength of the pairwise social link between the two members. In order to quantify the social relationship strength of the pairwise member social link, we categorize the social relationship strength into five different contact levels based on the average daily contact frequency between two members. These contact levels are shown in Table 7. For example, the social strength of a family that consists of a husband and wife is usually perfectly suitable for level 5 because they meet each other almost daily, while a faculty member and his Ph.D. student may fit level 2 if they have regular meetings twice a week. To measure the social relationship strength of a group with any number of members (at least two), we extend the two-member social measure and define the social group descriptor as follows: where | G | is the size (number of members) of group G and w i,j is the social level between group members i and j .Note that the social level is defined as zero ifapairofgroup members do not know each other. Consider the example of a wedding ceremony where the groom X  X  friends may not know the bride X  X  friends in advance. In this case, it is reasonable to consider their social levels to be zero .

Expertise Descriptor: In addition to social relation-ship, another important factor that may affect a group X  X  decision is the expertise of group members. To reach a con-sensus, the group decision process usually involves mild or
The examples used in this paper are based on real-world users, but user names are anonymized to protect privacy. Figure 2: Number of movies watched by individual group members. intense discussion. In this process, each group member is able to state his or her opinion based on the experience that he or she has. In general, experts in a group are more talkative and may attempt to persuade other group mem-bers. This can give rise to a situation where the final group decision is more inclined to correspond with the decision of the experts in the group. For example, Jack and Bob want to select some movies to watch together on a typical Satur-day evening. As illustrated in Table 6, Bob does not have much experience with gangster movies; therefore, he only gives two-star ratings to both of the movies. In contrast with Bob, Jack has watched many gangster movies and has more experience with this type of movies (i.e., an expert); therefore, he persuades Bob to watch these two gangster movies with him. In this case, the expertise factor, while it does not significantly influence Bob X  X  decision, dominates the final decision of the group. Consequently, we believe that expertise is another important factor that should be taken into account in the group decision process.
The expertise descriptor is devised to measure the relative expertise of individual group members. In general, the opin-ions of experts may be weighted more heavily than those of other group members. Similar to the strength of social rela-tionships, we categorize the expertise of an individual into five levels. To divide the expertise into different levels quan-titatively, we define the expertise level based on the number of movies that an individual has watched. Given a list of popular movies, the percentage of movies that an individual has watched is divided into five different bins, as shown in Table 8). For example, given a movie list containing 100 popular movies as well as a group consisting of four mem-bers, the number of movies that the group members have watched is listed in Figure 2. We then compute the percent-age of movies that each group member has watched, and assign each group member into a specific bin to determine the expertise level that an individual belongs to. For ex-ample, Jack has watched 67 movies out of 100 movies (i.e., 67% of movies in the 100-movie list), which means that his expertise belongs to the fourth level (60%  X  80% of movies has been watched). Recall that the expertise descriptor is  X  0.4 0.4  X  0.6 0.6  X  0.8 &gt; 0.8 40% 40%  X  60% 60%  X  80% &gt; 80% intended to measure the relative expertise of different group members. Therefore, we utilize the following equation to normalize the expertise levels into the range from 0 to 1: where E i ( G ) is the normalized relative expertise level of group member i in group G ,and e j is the absolute exper-tiselevelofeachgroupmember j . Clearly, the sum of the relative expertise levels of a group equals to 1.
Dissimilarity Descriptor: Dissimilarity also influences the final decision of a group. As suggested by Amer-Yahia et al. [8], dissimilarity should be considered in the context of a group decision strategy because dissimilarity describes the disagreement between any two group members. Intuitively, the closer the preference for an item between two members, the lower their disagreement for the item. In this work, we therefore devise the dissimilarity descriptor to measure the preference difference among a group. Here we use two metrics, average pairwise dissimilarity (APD) and variance dissimilarity (VD), to describe preference difference.
Given a group G and an item x , we define average pairwise dissimilarity as where | G | is the number of members in group G ,and r i,x r j,x denote item x  X  X  ratings given by group members i and j , respectively. Notice that i = j .Aswecansee, APD x ( G ) measures the average difference of any two group members X  ratings for item x . For example, Table 4 and 5 show that Tom, Nicole, and John X  X  ratings for the movie Forrest Gump are 5, 3, and 3. Using the average pairwise dissimilarity metric, the dissimilarity descriptors for this movie and the 3-member group has a value of 1.333.

Another metric for the dissimilarity descriptor is variance dissimilarity , defined as where | G | isthenumberofmembersingroup G , r i,x is group member i  X  X  rating for item x ,and avg x isthemeanofall individual members X  ratings for item x . This metric com-putes the mathematical variance of the preferences for the item among group members. Let us return to the example of Tom, Nicole, and John (see Table 4 and 5). Using the variance dissimilarity metric, we compute the dissimilarity descriptors for the first movie, which equals to 0.889. Note that the two different dissimilarity metrics usually result in different values.
As discussed in Section 4.1, to choose the appropriate group decision strategy, we should take the three factors  X  social factor, expertise factor and dissimilarity factor  X  into consideration. Here we propose a heuristic group consensus function that incorporates all three factors in order to gen-erate the final group rating for a given group and a given item.

Recall the social descriptor is used to identify the social relationship strength of a group. Our observations of group dynamics suggest that when the social relationship strength is strong and tight, the final decision that a group makes tends to reflect the maximum satisfaction of the group mem-bers. When the social descriptor value is low (i.e., weak so-cial ties), the final decision that a group makes tends to fol-low the average satisfaction or minimum misery strategies. Unlike the social relationship descriptor, the expertise de-scriptor is mainly used to apply a weight to each of the group members. A group member with more expertise, and thus more influence, receives a higher weight than other group members with less expertise. The dissimilarity descriptor mainly accounts for the fact that group members may not always have the same tastes. Our experiments suggest that when a disagreement occurs in a group, the final decision that a group makes reflects the level at which group mem-bers disagree with each other. Considering the three group factors collectively, we combine these three descriptors into a heuristic group consensus function that uses the three most common group decision strategies. Equation 8 quantifies the group decision strategy.  X   X   X   X   X  GR x = w 1  X  avg ( E i  X  r i,x )+ w 2  X  (1  X  dis x ) , if  X &lt;S&lt; X  GR x = w 1  X  max ( E i  X  r i,x )+ w 2  X  (1  X  dis x ) , if S&gt; X 
GR x = w 1  X  min ( E i  X  r i,x )+ w 2  X  (1  X  dis x ) , if S&lt; X  where dis x represents the dissimilarity descriptors, which can be either average pairwise dissimilarity or variance dis-similarity. w 1 and w 2 denote the relative importance of pref-erence and dissimilarity in the final decision, w 1 + w 2 and  X  are the thresholds that are used to identify the social relationship strength. As indicated in Equation 8, we har-ness the social relationship strength to choose the group de-cision strategy. Different social relationship strengths mean that a group makes its decision using different decision func-tions  X  average satisfaction, minimum misery or maximum satisfaction. According to our experience, we assign the threshold values for social relationship strength  X   X  and  X   X  0.67 and 0.33 respectively. In addition, Equation 8 also in-corporates expertise weights ( E i ) into each of the individual ratings ( r i,x ), and utilizes two parameters to adjust the dis-agreement. Here, these two values for w 1 and w 2 (0.8 and 0.2, respectively) are chosen after observing the data that we have collected from our user studies. An evaluation of this equation is presented in Section 5.
While our results show that our heuristic group consen-sus function works well, it is developed based on the specific cases we have observed. Ideally, we would like to develop a more general technique that would be applicable not only for example to movies, but also to other data items and groups. Accordingly, we have designed a generic framework that automatically analyzes group characteristics and gener-ates the corresponding group consensus function to predict group preferences. The basis for the design of this frame-work is associative classification [20, 22]. In data mining and machine learning, classification involves the construction of a model or classifier to predict categorical labels for data, such as  X  X ood X  or  X  X ad X . We cast the group movie recom-mendation task as a classification task, where the goal is to predict a group movie rating of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Associative classification uses association rules to perform classification. The following provides background on association rules and describes our general framework that uses association rules to generate appropriate consensus functions for any group.
Our framework generates association rules by mining the training data set (e.g., from user studies). Association rule mining is a popular method for discovering interesting rela-tions or patterns between variables in a dataset [6, 7]. For example, if two group members individually rate a movie with a rating of four, then this group of two also tends to agree on a group rating for four for this movie. This pattern can be represented as the following association rule: { minRating =4 } X { maxRating =4 } X  X  groupRating =4 }
To identify association rules, we must first search for fre-quent itemsets in the dataset. For example, in the case of a transaction dataset for a supermarket, a set of items, such as bread and butter, that appear frequently together in the dataset is a frequent itemset. In the simplified group movie rating example above, { minRating =4 } , { maxRating = 4 } ,and { groupRating =4 } would be a frequent itemset. One well-accepted algorithm for mining frequent itemsets is FP-growth [15]. FP-growth has been shown to be an effi-cient and scalable method for mining both long and short frequent itemsets.

After finding frequent itemsets, we generate strong asso-ciation rules from these frequent itemsets. These strong as-sociation rules must satisfy minimum values for support and confidence . The support of an association rule is defined as the percentage of transactions in the dataset containing all of the items in the rule. The confidence of an associa-tion rule is defined as the percentage of transactions in the dataset, containing the items in the rule, for which the rule is correct. More formally, for the rule A  X  B , confidence ( A  X  B )= P ( B | A )= support ( A
The following describes Algorithm 1, which we use to mine association rules from the dataset obtained from our user studies. First, we define meaningful attributes (items) in our data set. Based on our experience with the user stud-ies, we identify the following attributes: social strength ( S ), maximum group member rating, minimum group member rating, average group member rating, standard deviation of member ratings, average pairwise preference dissimilarity, average pairwise expertise dissimilarity, minimum expertise, maximum expertise, expert member identifier, and group

Algorithm 1: Construct associative classification rules rating. We define expertise as an estimate of the number of movies a group member has previously watched. The ex-pert member identifier is the identifier for the group member with the highest expertise. Average pairwise expertise dis-similarity is defined as and average pairwise preference dissimilarity for item x is defined as where e G,i and r x,G,i are the expertise and movie ratings values, respectively for group member i ,and | Pairs ( G ) the number of pairs of members (users) in group G .
After defining these attributes, we use FP-growth to iden-tify frequent itemsets in the data. Since FP-growth can only handle binomial (binary) attributes, we must discretize the numeric attributes in our data [32]. These numeric at-tributes are discretized using user-specified binning strate-gies for each attribute. For example, the minimum expertise attribute is discretized into the following bins:
Next, we generate quantitative association rules from these frequent predicate sets. Using the strong association rules mined from our data, we write classification heuristics that compute predicted group ratings for a movie given the indi-vidual group member ratings for that movie. These heuris-tics organize the rules in order of decreasing precedence based on their confidence and support, which is similar to the approach used in the CBA (Classification-Based Associ-ation) algorithm [22]. If a new rule has the same antecedent (left-hand side) as another rule already in the classifier, then the rule with lowest confidence for the antecedent is removed from the classifier. When predicting a group movie rating by classifying a new data item, the first rule satisfying the item is used to classify it. Intuitively, these heuristics cap-ture how groups make decisions about which movie to watch based on the attributes indicated previously.
In this section, we evaluate the proposed group recom-mender system using real-world group-based user studies. Our goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the social, exper-tise, and dissimilarity group descriptors, and the quality of both the heuristic-based group consensus function and the rule-based generic framework for group consensus.
From 2009 to 2010, we have recruited 10 groups (32 indi-viduals) to participate in our user studies. All participants are college or graduate students with an approximate aver-age age of 28. For each group, individual group members are asked to describe his or her social relationships with other members in the group. The social relationships be-tween two peers mainly contain the following four types of relationships: couple, close friends, acquaintances and first acquaintances. The strength of these four social relation-ships are sequentially decreasing. Additionally, in order to quantify the strength of their social relationship, each of the participants is asked to provide his or her contact frequency with other group members (i.e., how frequently the partici-pant interacts with other group members). Based on these reported social relationships, we categorize the 10 groups into four different types: four couple groups (with two mem-bers per group), two close-friend groups (three members per group), three acquaintance groups (two members per group) and one first-acquaintance group with 12 members.
We believe the composition of our groups is representa-tive of many scenarios in the real world. Typically, a first-acquaintance group is fairly large, such as a group in college student orientation in which group members do not know each other very well. On the other hand, groups with strong relationships are usually relatively small, since it is difficult for all group members to know each other in a large group. For example, at a party some people may know a majority of their fellow partygoers, whereas others may not. Though our user studies can represent many groups in the real world, there are a few cases that we have not investigated, such as a very large group where classmates know each other to varying degrees (e.g. a big high school class). We plan to continue investigating more diverse groups, including very large groups.
The goal of our user studies is to collect information re-garding social relationships, movie preferences, and exper-tise levels for the members of each group and then utilize this data to evaluate the performance of our proposed group consensus functions. To obtain the movie preferences and expertise levels of each participant, we selected 20 movies out of the top 250 popular movies from IMDB [4]. For our study, it is impractical to select the 20 movies from the pool randomly, since random selection may give rise to a situation in which the selected movies may all belong to a small set of genres. For example, the 20 selected movies may belong to only two genres  X  horror and science fiction. In this case, Figure 5: Still frame from 12-person group user study, showing group members discussing their opinions about a movie. the expertise levels that we collect from our participants may contain a strong bias, since it is possible that some partici-pants are big fans of horror movies or science-fiction movies and have watched a lot of movies in these genres, but they cannot be considered as movie experts in all movie genres. To avoid this potential bias, we select the movies used for our user study across 10 different movie genres including Action, Comedy, Crime, Family, Horror, Science Fiction, Thriller, Romance and War . In our study, each movie genre contains two movies.

Asking each participant to view all 20 movies and provide ratings for each movie is impractical. Instead, we ask each participant to watch the trailers of these 20 movies, because each trailer is usually 2  X  3 minutes long. A previous study has indicated that using movie trailers to capture people X  X  preferences is realistic and efficient [31]. All participants are instructed to provide ratings on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 be-ing the worst and 5 being the most favorite) for these 20 movie trailers according to their movie preferences. In ad-dition, for the purpose of expertise information collection, we ask participants to identify those movies that they have previously watched. Since the study is conducted in an in-dependent environment (i.e., making personal decision with-out discussion and interruption), we believe that the ratings that each participant provides for us correctly represent the movie preferences of the participant. After we collect the movie preferences of each participant, the participants are asked to return to their groups and begin discussion about these 20 movie trailers. The purpose of this discussion is to provide group ratings for the movies. Intuitively, group ratings are quite diverse and may not have correlations with each group member, regardless of the size of the group (see Figure 3). Both the group ratings from the 10 groups and the participants X  individual ratings are used for verifying our group consensus functions. Figure 5 shows a video still frame from our 12-person user study. This still frame was captured soon after the group had finished watching a movie trailer and provided their individual ratings, and shows the group members discussing their opinions about the movie.
In the context of prediction, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is a widely used evaluation metric. RMSE mea-Figure 3: Individual ratings vs. group rating in a regular group.

It is generally accepted as a good measure of precision. In our setting, we are interested in the precision of our prediction with respect to movie ratings provided by a given group. RMSE can be formalized as follows:
Given two vectors, where the first vector contains the ac-tual group ratings for n movies, called ground truth, GT = [ r ,r 2 , ..., r n ], and the second vector contains predicted group ratings for n movies, PR =[ r 1 ,r 2 , ..., r n ], RMSE is calcu-lated by the following equation When the predicted group ratings are very close to the actual group ratings, the value of r i  X  r i is close to zero , and the RMSE is also close to zero . Therefore, smaller RMSE values indicate better predictions.

One other measure we use for evaluation is Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient [28] , which measures the cor-relation between two variables X and Y . where  X  X and  X  Y are standard deviation of variable X and Y , respectively. A value close to 1.0 indicates strong positive correlation between the two variables; a value close to -1.0 indicates strong negative correlation, and a value close to 0 indicates low correlation. Therefore, we harness the Pearson correlation coefficient to investigate which group members or characteristics dominate a group X  X  decision.
The purpose of our real-world user study based experi-ments is to help us to answer the following questions: (1) Is the group decision p rocess affected by the group X  X  social and expertise characteristics? (2) Is there a general group consensus function (i.e., group decision model) that can capture the group behaviors? (3) If there is a group consensus function that captures group behaviors, can it be applied to all groups or a majority of groups? (4) How well do our heuristic-based and rule-based group decision models, or consensus functions, perform in compar-ison to a state-of-the-art group decision model [8] ?
We first evaluate the impact of members X  expertise on a group X  X  decision. Figure 4 shows, for a two-member group in our study, individual members X  ratings and group ratings for the 20 movies we have selected. To examine how an ex-pert in the group dominates the group X  X  final decision, we initially compute the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between each group member X  X  ratings and group ratings. In this case, the correlation coefficient between user 1 X  X  ratings and the group X  X  ratings is equal to 0.9388 (highly correlated), and the correlation coefficient between the other group member X  X  ratings and the group X  X  ratings is 0.1320 (low correlation). These results indicate that user 1 X  X  deci-sions are highly correlated with the group X  X  final decisions, while user 2 X  X  decisions are weakly correlated. Therefore, we conclude that the final decision of this group is strongly dominated by user 1. To better understand why the prefer-ences of user 2 carry less weight than user 1 X  X  preferences in the group decision process, we further investigate the movie expertise of each group member. According to the exper-tise information that the two members have provided  X  17 watched movies out of the 20 movies (for user 1) vs. 7 watchedmoviesoutofthe20movies(foruser2) X  X eob-serve that the expertise of the group members clearly has a significant impact on the group decision. This effect is ap-parent in many groups that participated in our user studies.
Next, we investigate how social relationships can affect a group X  X  decision. To examine the impact of social relation-ships, we select three different groups: a couple group 2 acquaintance group, and a first-acquaintance group. These groups are selected based on the varying social relationship strengths present in these groups. Intuitively, the social rela-tionship strength of these groups follows a descending trend (i.e., based on social relationship strength, couple group &gt; acquaintance group &gt; first-acquaintance group). Further-more, the three groups that we select all claim similar mem-ber expertise within a group, thus the expertise factor does not have impact on the group decision process.

To understand how social relationship affects a group X  X  decision, we use three of the most common group decision strategies, average satisfaction, minimum misery, and max-imum satisfaction, to predict the group decision, and then compare the predicted ratings with the actual group ratings (ground truth) by computing the Pearson correlation coef-ficient between each prediction and the ground truth. For the couple group, the computed Pearson correlation values of the three decision strategies are 0.7393 (average satisfac-tion), 0.8324 (maximum satisfaction) and 0.4866 (minimum misery). As we can see from these results, of the three deci-sion strategies, the group rating predicted by maximum sat-isfaction has the highest correlation with the actual group decision. Therefore, we conclude that the maximum satis-
Since the couple group and close-friend group have the same behaviors and social relationship strength, we believe that couple group can also represent the close friend group, and thus we only consider the couple group. faction strategy captures the group decision of the couple group relatively well. Similar to the couple group, the ac-quaintance group also consists of two group members. In contrast to the couple group, the members in the acquain-tance group have a weaker social relationship. Furthermore, the values of the Pearson correlations for the acquaintance group also differ from the values for the couple group. For the acquaintance group, the values of Pearson correlation are 0.9290 (average satisfaction), 0.8386 (maximum satis-faction), and 0.8693 (minimum misery). We observe that the performance of the average satisfaction strategy exceeds the other two strategies. Finally, we also compute the Pear-son correlation values for the first-acquaintance group, which consists of 12 group members. The Pearson correlation val-ues for this group are 0.5927 (average satisfaction), 0.1808 (most satisfaction), and 0.9485 (minimum misery). In this case, the best decision strategy is the minimum misery strat-egy. Observing the three groups and the variation in their Pearson correlation values, we conclude that a decrease in the social relationship strength results in a variation in group decision strategy. Based on the data from our user studies, we conclude that a group with a strong social relationship tends to maximize the satisfaction of a user in the group, while a group with a weak social relationship tends to min-imize the misery of a user in the group.

We next investigate whether our heuristic group consen-sus function that combines the social, expertise, and dissim-ilarity descriptors (described in Section 4.2) can accurately predict a group X  X  decision. Here we use a state-of-the-art group decision model [8] as the baseline for comparison with our group consensus functions. To make the comparison we compute each group X  X  RMSE between the predicted rat-ings and the actual group ratings (see Figure 6), as well as the average RMSE of the 10 groups in our user stud-ies (see Table 9). As shown in Table 9, the 2nd and 3rd columns represent the baseline (i.e., group decision predic-tion using the two consensus functions introduced in [8]), the 4 th and 5 th columns represent the group decision pre-dicted using our heuristic functions that use either pairwise dissimilarity (PD) or variance dissimilarity (VD), and the last column is the group decision predicted using our asso-ciative classifier (called  X  X ule-based X  in the table). As shown in Table 9, in comparison with the baseline functions, our heuristic group consensus functions provides approximately 33%  X  35% improvement and our rule-based group decision strategy provides 17%  X  21% improvement in comparison with the baseline. Consequently, we believe our group con-sensus functions more efficiently and precisely capture group behaviors and predict group decisions.

Although our group consensus functions show great im-provement in terms of overall prediction precision, Figure 6 indicates that the improvement is not present for all groups. As shown in Figure 6, we can observe that for Group 3 , Group 8 ,and Group 10 , our association rule-based consensus function has a higher RMSE than the baseline. In contrast, the heuristic group decision strategy shows optimal predic-tion precision in all 10 groups. The primary reason behind this is that the rule-based function is designed using an asso-ciative classification method which needs a sufficiently rep-resentative training dataset. Our 10-group user studies may not provide sufficient data to train our associative classifier such that it provides accurate predictions for all groups. We believe that with more user studies, our rule-based consensus function can perform well in terms of prediction precision for a variety of groups. Overall, our evaluation results demon-strate that our group consensus functions accurately predict a majority of group decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel group recommendation solution that incorporates both social and content interests of group members. We study the key group characteristics that impact group decisions, and propose a group consensus function that captures the social, expertise, and interest dis-similarity among group members. What is more, we propose a generic framework that can automatically analyze various group characteristics and generate the corresponding group consensus function. Both the consensus function we propose and the generic framework perform well on real-world user studies consisting of groups of various sizes, user interests, and social relationships.

Recent work [34, 14] has shown that relationship strength can be accurately inferred from a model based on profile similarity and interaction activity on online social networks (OSNs), such as Facebook and LinkedIn. Context-aware data fusion systems, such as [9], enable context-aware ap-plications that can automatically detect user presence and take appropriate actions based on inputs available from mo-bile, sensor, and social data sources. Combining a model for inferring relationship strength with a context-aware data fu-sion system and our techniques for group recommendation would allow us to develop applications that detect the pres-ence of group members, automatically infer the strength of the social connections within the group, and provide accu-rate recommendations to the group. We plan to explore this space of novel context-aware applications.

The class of context-aware applications described above requires data sources for individual preference information. While OSN profiles provide some information about prefer-ences, such as favorite movies found on Facebook profiles, such preference information may be inadequate for group recommender systems. In the case of movies, Netflix rat-ing profiles provide a wealth of preference information. We plan to investigate linking social network profiles with such sources of detailed item ratings. Recent developments, in-cluding the Facebook Graph API [1], Facebook social plug-ins [2], and the Freebase API [3], may simplify the linkage of disparate data sources like Facebook and Netflix.
While sophisticated context-aware applications will allow us to automatically detect the presence of group members, infer their social connections, and obtain detailed individ-ual preference information, the problem of obtaining ground truth data regarding actual group preferences remains. We are not aware of any existing repository of group preference information. To that end, we plan to continue our group user studies in an effort to learn more about the group decision making process in a variety of contexts.
