 The Web is structured as a hypermedia system, in which documents are linked to one another, and users surf from one document to another along hypermedia links that seum, but visitors find it difficult to locate the relevant documents on the Web, which is provided by individuals and institutions scattered throughout the world 
The common ways of finding information on the Web is through query-based search engines or designing an effective and efficient classification scheme. Some web sites today build intelligent recommender systems that can automatically recom-mend the documents according to the interests of each individual visitor [2][3]. There are three prevalent approaches to build recommender systems: Collaborative Filtering (CF), Content-based (CB) recommendation and Content-based Collaborative Filtering (CBCF). Recommender systems help to over come information overload by providing personalized suggestions based on the history of a user's likes and dislikes [4]. 
The content-based approach to recommendation has its roots in the information re-trieval (IR) community, and employs many of the same techniques [3]. CB methods can uniquely characterize each user, but CF still has some key advantages over them [4][5]. The collaborative approach to recomme ndation is very different. Instead of mends items other similar users have liked. Instead of computing the similarity of the items, it computes the similarity of the users. As suggested by Malone, collaborative filtering takes advantage of social interactions between people to create a filter [6]. A further motivation for collaborative filtering comes from the following observation made by Hill [7]. 
CF exploits similarities between the tastes of different users to recommend (or ad-embodies the idea of Human-Machine Integration. The basic idea of CF is [8]: (1) the system maintains a user-item matrix, and every row of this matrix is a user profile (a tion contained in them to recommend (o r advise against) items to the user. 
CF System has been used fairly successfully to build recommender systems in vari-ous domains [1][2][8]. However they suffer from some fundamental problems, one of which is the "Matchmaker" problem. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the "Matchmaker" problem and we migrate the Hits algorithm [9] from Hyperlink analy-informal experimental results in section 5; finally in section 6, we conclude with some future extensions to our work. The "Matchmaker" problem involved in CF put simply is, some users have big corre-lation efficient based on the user-item matrix, but these users can't recommend au-thoritative web pages. In other words, these users are not reliable. 
This problem is a big trouble for those beginners who are new to the field con-introduction web pages. So similar users for a beginner are still beginners, and IWWS recommends web pages based on these similar beginners. In fact, beginners need recommendation from experts, and IWWS should recommend authoritative web pages to users. 
Therefore, IWWS need to weigh those reliable advisors. Then the next problem is how IWWS distinguish reliable advisors from trite advisors? group. The advisors are chosen based on their similarity to the active user, the similarity between two users is computed using the Pearson correlation coefficient in IWWS [4]. from the link structures to address this issue. Hits algorithm [9] formulate of the no-pages and the set of "hub pages" that join them together in the link structure. 
We start describing the Hits algorithm with the explanation of hub pages, which have links to multiple relevant authoritative pages. Hubs and authorities exhibit what could be called a mutually reinforcing relationship: a good hub is a page that points to hubs [9]. 
With an eye to select those reliable advisor, we associate a non-negative authority weight A with each document and a non-negative reliability weight R with each advi-their squares sum to 1. The following iterative algorithm makes use of the relationship dates numerical weights for each user and each document: 
Numerically, it X  X  naturally to express the mutually reinforcing relationship between advisors and web documents: if an advisor recommends many good web documents recommended by many a good advisor with a large R -value, it should receive a large A -value. We have partly implemented IWWS, a web site wizard tool based on the framework described below. Here we will discuss those implementation-specific issues during our development. The right-top part of the framework performs the kernel activities. 
IWWS analyzes the web site log files to construct user-page matrix, from which we can compute the reliability of every user who recommends authoritative pages for active visitors. 
CF always uses neighborhood-based algorithms, where a subset of users are chosen reliable neighborhoods, we compute the predictions as follows: 
Where Pir is the prediction for the active user r for item i; Rk is the reliability for user k; and C(r,k) is the similarity between users r and k. IWWS uses a neighborhood size of 30 [4]. 
Our experiment was performed on a Question-and-Answer part of the website, where students asked questions and their teacher would answer these questions. Many just browse the answer, or he may submit the question. The website contained 331 questions and their corresponding answers on Oct.29 2002. 
A key point during the construction of extended referential user-item matrix of our experiments is detailed access to logs for users' surfing behaviors. Totally, 3,835 users these 484 users. 
The referential users' reliabilities will converge to fixed points if iterate the opera-tions (1) and (2) with an arbitrarily large va lues. But we just need to sort the referen-reliability is stable. 
The performance measurement method used in IR is somewhat problematic in our experiment. Since our domain is the Web, we can't rely on a standardized collection, inappropriate [10]. We use a new performance measurement method derived from NDPM (Normalized Distance based Performance Measure) [11]. NDPM differs be-tween ideal recommendation and system's recommendation for the user. Lower num-ber of NDPM denotes that the algorithm provides better performance of recommenda-tion. We focus on the probability of web pages recommended by IWWS containing the page actually visited by active users, who don't know IWWS run on the web server in our experiment. IWWS starts to recommend web page for a user as soon as he visits 4 or more pages. 
We compare the web site logs from Oct.28 2002 to Oct.30 2002 with the recom-mendation of IWWS. IWWS recommends pages for the surfing users 492 time every round, with the recommended pages varying every round. Figure 5 shows the com-parative results with pure collaborative r ecommendation. As the recommended pages increases every time, these approaches would more likely recommend the web pages users visited actually, and the differences among these approaches decrease, i.e. IWWS improves on sort of recommended pages. In this paper, we present a novel method to incorporate Hits algorithm into collabora-tive filtering, which significantly improves the prediction quality of recommender systems. The comparative results also exhibits that IWWS sorts the web pages rec-ommended for users out considerately. 
This paper opens the door to a wide range of future work. Here, we list two of our ongoing work. First, we are creating a hybrid recommender system by combining both collaborative and content-based filtering. Both pure CF or CB approaches are special cases of hybrid CBCF scheme. If the content analysis component returns just a laborative recommendation; if there is only a single user, it will degenerate into pure content-based recommendation [3]. Second, we are looking for a way to rearrange the organization of web sites, thus IWWS will act as an effective device for users to surf from one page to another with-out returning to the directory every time. This domain needs further research both in theory and technology. This research is partly supported by the National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant No.G1998030410.
