 Throughout the biomedical and life sciences research community, advanced integrative biology algorithms are employed to integrate large scale data across many different high-dimensional datatypes to construct predictive ne twork models of disease. The causal inference approaches we employ for this purpose well complement the types of natural artificial intelligence/machine learning approaches that have become nearly standard in the life and biomedical sciences for build ing classifiers for a range of problems, from disease classificati on and subtype stratification, to the identification of responders and non-responders for a given treatment strategy. By building a causal network model that spans multiple scales (from the mol ecular to the cellular, to the tissue/organ, to the organism and community) we can understand the flow of information and how best to modulate that flow to improve human wellbeing, whethe r better diagnosing and treating disease or improving overall health( 1-4 ). More specifically, we have constructed predictive network models for Alzheimer X  X  disease, along with other comm on human diseases such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer, and demonstrated a causal network common across all of these diseases( 3, 5-10 ). Not only do we demonstrate that our predictive models uncover important mechanisms of disease and mechanistic connections among different diseases, but that they have led to a natural way to prioritize therapeutic points of intervention and provide optimal molecular phenotypes for high throughput screening. Our application of these models in a number of disease areas has led to the identification of novel genes that are causal for disease and that may serve as efficacious points of therapeutic interventi on, as well as to personalized treatment strategies that provide a more quantitative and accurate approach to tailoring treatments to specific forms of disease.

Previously, Dr. Schadt had been the Chief Scientific Officer at Pacific Biosciences, overseeing the scientific strategy for the company, including creating the vision for next-generation sequencing a pplications of the company X  X  technology. Dr. Schadt is al so a founding member of Sage Bionetworks, an open access genomics initiative designed to build and support databases and an acce ssible platform for creating innovative, dynamic models of di sease. Dr. Schadt X  X  current efforts at Mount Sinai to generate and integrate large-scale, high-dimension molecular, cellular, and clinical data to build more predictive models of disease so that we may better diagnose and treat disease, were motivated by the genomics and systems biology research he led at Merck to elucidate common human diseases and drug response using novel computational approaches applied to genetic and molecula r profiling data. His research helped revolution a field in sta tistical genetics (the genetics of gene expression), has energized th e systems biology field, and has led to a number of discoveries relating to the causes of common human diseases. Dr. Schadt received his B.S. in applied mathematics from California Polytechnic State University, his M.S. in pure mathematics from UCD, and his Ph.D. in biomathematics from UCLA.
