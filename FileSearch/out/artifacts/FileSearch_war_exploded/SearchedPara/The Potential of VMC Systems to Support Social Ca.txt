 Video-mediated communication systems allow to communi-cate over distance and offer possibilities to build up or main-tain social relationships. Such systems convey a variety of non-verbal cues (e.g., gestures or facial expressions), which support mutual understanding and can evoke the feeling of being close to the remote communication partner. The aim of my thesis is to investigate the potential of video-mediated communication systems to increase cohesion and identity of small groups and develop a sense of belongingness, i.e., sup-port bonding forms of social capital. This will be done by investigating the interrelation between social presence and social capital in video-mediated communication.

Video-mediated communication (VMC) systems have be-come an integral part of everyday life for many people. For example, Skype or Face-time, allow to communicate over distance at almost every time and place and hold poten-tial to build up and maintain social relationships. These relationships imply actual or potential resources, i.e., social capital [2]. In research there is a growing interest in social capital theory, but it has so far mainly been investigated in the context of social network sites (e.g., [3, 4, 6]).
According to Putnam [10], it can be distinguished between bonding and bridging forms of social capital. Whereas bridg-ing capital facilitates the access to external resources, e.g., providing aid for career moves [5], bonding forms increase co-hesion and identity of small groups. Members of such groups share a strong sense of belongingness, which is mainly based on common norms and attitudes.

In my thesis, I will explore in what way VMC systems hold potential to build up and/or maintain social relation-ships that increase cohesion and identity of small groups, i.e., how bonding forms of social capital can be supported. VMCs allow to convey a variety of non-verbal cues, which are important in human communication [7] and allow to ex-perience being close to the communication partner (i.e., so-cial presence).

The concept of social presence, helps to understand a user X  X  experience when communicating over distance and provides insights how natural communication can be sup-ported. Social presence can be defined as the sense of being with another person,  X  X he moment-to-moment awareness of co-presence [...] the sense of accessibility of the other being X  X  psychological, emotional, and intentional states X  [1] (p.10) or as Short et al. [11] would define the  X  X egree of salience of the other person in a mediated communication and the con-sequent salience of their interpersonal interactions X  (p.65).
To support social presence, a system needs to be designed to allow, for example, interactivity and immediacy [12]. In-teractivity is considered as engagement and is illustrated by activities users perform and the feedback they receive. It might be comparable to what Biocca and Harms [1] define as mutual understanding or psychological involvement that is influenced by a temporal component: immediacy. Imme-diacy influences interactivity through straightforward reac-tions of communication partners. This in turn might have a positive impact on social presence [12] and can support natural communication. VMC systems enable the trans-portation of non-verbal cues (e.g., facial expressions) and allow to convey unspoken information, which are important in human communication [7]. However, a VMC system that enables natural communication does not necessarily increase cohesion or a sense of belongingness.
To understand in what way VMC systems that enable social presence actually hold potential to support bonding forms of social capital, a theoretical understanding of the di-mensions and constituting factors of social presence in VMC, and a profound understanding about the interrelation be-tween social capital theory and social presence is required. Accordingly the following research questions were defined: RQ1 What are dimensions and constituting factors of social presence in VMC? RQ2 In what way do VMC systems that support social presence hold potential for social capital?
Based on these insights implications for the design of VMC systems will be derived. This leads to my third research question:
RQ3 How do VMC systems need to be designed to sup-port bonding forms of social capital?
The first steps towards answering RQ1 were a literature analysis on the concept of social presence and user studies in the lab, in order to investigate different dimensions of social presence that are important in VMC. So far, two studies have been carried out, using a VMC system that consists of two screens and two cameras. It illustrates the commu-nication partner almost life-sized and conveys a variety of non-verbal cues (see Figure 1).

The first study aimed at investigating interdependencies of eye contact, gaze behavior, and gestures with respect to social presence. This work has already been published as work-in-progress at CHI 2013 [9]. For the study a between subject design with two experimental conditions (eye con-tact/no eye contact during a VMC) was applied. The re-sults indicate that the perception of non-verbal cues (e.g., gestures) is highly depending on whether eye contact is pos-sible or not.

Based on the first study that provided initial insights on the importance of eye contact on social presence a follow-up study was done in summer 2013 to further investigate the interrelation between non-verbal cues in VMC and social presence. A within subject design with the same experi-mental conditions was applied to reduce error variance, as-sociated with individual differences of the users. The results of the second study show that a user X  X  awareness of having eye contact positively influences social presence, indicating the importance of the subjective perception of a user within a mediated communication 1 .

The process of answering RQ2 has just begun and started with investigating the interrelation between social capital theory and social presence. First results of this work have been published at ISPR 2014 [8]. To gain insights in what the study has not been published yet way a VMC system allows to build up relationships and sup-ports a feeling of connectedness an explorative field study, carried out in spring 2013, was analyzed using social capital theory. The work was inspired by and related to a three year X  X  project that aimed at developing a VMC system for older adults, who are hardly able to meet their family and friends face-to-face due to age-related disabilities 2 .
Older adults, who did not know each other before, used the aforementioned VMC system over a period of six weeks to be in contact with each other. It was investigated in what way participants experienced social presence, and if their perceived feeling of being connected to other users (perceived bonding capital) changed over time. For data assessment a multi-method approach was chosen, includ-ing qualitative and quantitative methods (e.g., interviews, questionnaires). The data was interpreted based on social capital theory and allowed to explore the interrelationship between social presence and social capital. The results indi-cate, that social presence in terms of co-presence and mutual understanding is a core factor to establish trustworthy re-lationships and to enhance reciprocity, which in turn are important dimensions of bonding forms of social capital.
In a next step it is planned to further investigate the different dimensions of social presence that might be rele-vant for social capital, using VMC systems such as Skype or FaceTime. A user study in the field is planned, applying qualitative and quantitative methods to assess participants X  perceived bonding capital (e.g., [4]). In parallel, in order to answer RQ3, first implications for the design of VMC systems are developed.
This research work is expected to result in a more holistic understanding in what way VMC systems support the de-velopment of bonding forms of social capital. By exploring different dimensions of social presence and investigating the interrelationship with social capital it is intended to elab-orate a concept that allows to identify relevant aspects for the design of VMC systems. This should support the estab-lishment and maintenance of valuable social relationships that increase cohesion and identity and support a sense of belongingness.
