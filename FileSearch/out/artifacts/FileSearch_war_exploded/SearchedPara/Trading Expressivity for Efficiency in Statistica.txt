 Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) is concerned with build-ing statistical models for relational data. While SRL ap-proaches have shown much potential in complex real-world application domains, their computational complexity remains a major issue and often limits their practical applicability. This thesis is concerned with relatively simple yet efficient SRL techniques. We show how expressivity and generality can be traded for efficiency by restricting model complexity and developing special-purpose inference and learning algo-rithms that take advantage of such restrictions, as well as by tailoring models to specific application domains . Statistical relational learning (SRL) combines state-of-the-art statistical modeling with relational representations [2; 1]. It thereby promises to provide effective machine learn-ing techniques for domains that cannot adequately be de-scribed using a propositional representation, that is, a rep-resentation in which examples are described by a fixed set of attributes. Driven by new applications in which data is structured, interrelated, and heterogeneous, this area of machine learning has recently received increasing attention. Example domains for SRL include structure-activity pre-diction for molecules in bioformatics, classification of web pages based on the surrounding hyperlink structure, or the analysis of data from the interaction of several (human or artificial) agents, as in social networks or multiplayer games. Such domains are visualized in Figure 1.
 However, combining statistical modeling and relational rep-resentations also poses new challenges. There is a trade-off between the expressivity of a machine learning formalism and its computational efficiency, as a higher expressivity en-tails a larger search space during inference and learning. Propositional machine learning techniques are at one end of this trade-off, while approaches that combine the full power of statistical and relational learning are at the other end. We present a collection of simple SRL techniques that focus on computational efficiency rather than maximum expres-sivity, and thereby occupy an intermediate position in the outlined expressivity-efficiency trade-off. Such systems are useful for application domains where more powerful SRL approaches cannot be applied because of their prohibitive servable data, the resulting learning and inference tasks be-come significantly easier than in the general case. Sequence elements can be either individual relational facts or com-plete relational state descriptions. An example domain for the first setting is a log of communication events from a mo-bile phone user, where a fact call ( outgoing, 233111 , busy ) indicates that the user has tried to reach the phone num-ber 233111 but the line was busy. To deal with this set-ting we proposed r-grams, which extend simple n-gram models to the relational case [5]. In r-grams, grams can be generalized both by shortening the gram and by rela-tional generalization, that is, by introducing variables as in call ( outgoing, X, busy ). Variables and unification is used to share information between consecutive sequence elements. An example domain for the second setting are massively multiplayer online games, in which game states are char-acterized by several players, game artifacts, and their rela-tionship (see Figure 1). Such games feature complex interac-tions of players in social networks, and can be seen as mod-els for real-world environments in which humans interact. For this setting, we proposed a simple model that defines a distribution over sequences of relational state descriptions called CPT-L [9], based on the well-known causal probabilis-tic logic CP-logic . In contrast to standard CP-logic, CPT-L is specifically tailored to sequences, and assumes that data is fully observable. This allows for much more efficient in-ference and learning compared to general CP-logic.
 A different way of trading expressivity for efficiency in SRL is to specialize systems to a particular application domain. The general idea is to first model a relational domain in a general-purpose SRL framework, ground the model in the application domain, and then develop special-purpose algo-rithms for efficient inference and learning in this particu-lar ground model. We explored this approach in two im-portant real-world application domains: population-based haplotype reconstruction from genotype data, and human activity recognition from RFID sensor data. The resulting systems compare favorably to state-of-the-art solutions in terms of effectiveness and efficiency [7; 4]. Statistical relational learning has shown wide application potential, but computational complexity issues limit the prat-ical applicability of many approaches. In this thesis we have proposed ways of improving computational efficiency in SRL
