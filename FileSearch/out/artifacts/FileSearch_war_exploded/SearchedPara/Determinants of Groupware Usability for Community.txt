 It is widely recognized by both Federa l and State governments that the Community Care sector in Australia is in crisis. The Australian population is ageing rapidly, forc-ing a greater expansion in community care facilities to take the pressure off expensive hospital beds [1]. These community care facilities are homes to many elderly people their final years peaceful and enjoyable. However, both Federal and State govern-ments are finding that recruitment and retention of nurses in community care is a major problem [1]. One of the important causes of disaffection of community care workers is  X  X ocumentation burden X   X  the onerous task of documenting all aspects of patient care [2,3,4]. 
Although the advantages of Information Technology itself and the benefits from its widespread adoption in many other industries have given practitioners great expecta-such as tourism, finance etc, and it is even lower in the community care sector than in the general health care industry. Not surprisingly, from our literature review, there has been little research on the use of IT and the success of a usable Information System in Community Care of Australia. 
For the obvious characteristic of Community Care work is spatial and temporal dis-tribution requesting for shared-workspace, ther e is a need to design and implement the systems into sort of groupware systems (called Community Care Groupware System -CCGS). But from investigation, the deployment of CCGS often encounters resistance from those professionals who must use them. A major possible barrier to the effective uptake of CCGS could be the lack of understanding of the occupational, social and cultural characteristics and the general computer skills of community care workers. Such barrier directly causes that CCGS does not meet the user expectations. Develop-information systems, resulting in a serious mismatch between the work practices, social characteristics and computer skills of community care workers and the actual performances of CCGS. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the context of use, users X  perspective and expectation to CC GS could, potentially, improve the accep-tance and usability of CCGS, ensuring that the success of CCGS can be more easily achieved and more potential benefits are realized. 2.1 The Importance of Context of Use to Usability [5] is  X  X he extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve speci-fied goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use X . Context of use consists of the users, tasks, equipment (hardware, software and materi-als) and physical and organizational environm ents which influence the interaction [6]. Donyaee and Seffah [7] designed QUIM (Quality in Use Integrated Map) to analyze the structure of usability. We simplify and ameliorate the model as Figure 1. Usability dicted. 
Distinguished with functional requirement, usability requirements always answer such questions: How do users approach this work? How do they think about the tasks? How do they judge a successful experience? [8] To obtain these answers more successfully, worthwhile experience from the past projects on the same domain, and a the developer team set to design. If a better understanding of user needs and context of use brings a new picture, this may change design assumptions and even develop-ment approaches of the system [8]. Furthermore, Bevan and Macleod [6] have claimed that the characteristics of the context may be as important in determining aspect of the context of use may change the usability of the product. To be more de-tailed, working characteristic in any industry or business is an important component of specified context of use, and play an important role in understanding and achieving usability performance of the system, and further deeply influence the acceptance and adoption of CCGS. 2.2 Working Characteristics of Community Care in Australia Community Care is a community-based health service, which provides high quality services for keeping the best health and quality of life in Australia. Services go to all sections of the community, individuals, families and groups with special needs. Shared home care is a cooperative work that involves different professionals, consists of mobile workers and requires immediate and ubiquitous access to patient-oriented data which are documented in different information systems. 
Sue Richardson etc have conducted a survey on 2881 residential community care facilities across Australia regarding their staff X  X  current characteristics and workforce. With the usable data from 1746 respondents, a completive and forceful report [9] was generated by the research group. Several specific working characteristics that directly influence the context of use of CCGS have been analyzed and elicited from this re-port: a) The majority of community care professionals are nursing professionals more than other healthcare professionals [10]. The typical nurse is female, Australian born, mostly community about 40-50, has modest school education but not too much, and lack of ordinary computer skills [9]. employees. home by mobile workers. A patient can receive services from several different nurses. Workers spend much time out of the facilities, so they often do not see each other face to face. However, since multiple workers can work with the same patient, their ac-tions are interdependent and require tight collaboration. skills in providing direct care on each resident [9]. This issue makes most of them feel under pressure to work harder. they devote a dissatisfying amount of time to the direct care of the residents and they strongly agree that they have enough and necessary skills on job itself. labour intensity in community care becomes bigger and bigger. Much more documen-tation has been found to take a lot of time. Some of the workers cite paperwork as one of the worst aspects of their job, others complain about the pattern of hours that they worked. Poor usability in distributed shared-workspace systems has prompted CSCW (Com-puter Supported Cooperative Work) researchers to develop discount usability methods for designing and evaluating groupware [11]. Discount methods work well with low fidelity prototypes, which allow evaluations to take place during early development the evaluation does not happen in real work, information about the task context must be articulated and used synthetically. 
As there are currently no modeling or analysis schemes appropriate for groupware usability evaluation, Pinelle and Gutwin [12] has developed a new task modeling technique that is able to represent the flexibility and variability that is inherent in real-world group task behaviour. This technique uses a level of analysis that fitly allow for usability evaluation of a group interface. As shown in Figure 2, the task model com-tivities related to achieving a specific outcome, as well as user specifications, a group scenarios. Tasks only describe what occurs in a scenario, but not how it occurs. How into individual task instantiations (the taskwork component of a task) and collabora-mechanics of collaboration is defined to identify how collaborative activities take place and allow important but easily-overlooked aspects of a task. The lowest level is actions, which describe common ways to carry out the mechanic specified in the col-laborative task instantiation. 
Using the task model in the usability evaluation of CCGS can explicitly provide both the developers and users to consider how well the prototype design supports tended outcomes for the scenario. It also helps to find out the interface usability prob-lems more easily and comprehensively. 4.1 Sampling To get the user perspective influenced by special social, cultural and working charac-teristics of community care sector, to find out what factors most influence community hierarchy  X  X sability criteria for CCGS X  (see Figure 1) and conduct a survey on com-munity care nurses in Illawarra region of Australia. The survey targets on real com-munity care nurses who had better have a modest familiarity and experience with a CCGS. This requirement ensures that the participants have already had some ideas about what a CCGS is, what complaints could be from their past experience, and what their needs and expectation of a CCGS are. Due to the stressful workload and pre-cious time of community care professionals as well as the low adoption of CCGS, the final amount of participants is 23. 4.2 Methods The core of this research is identification of the discrepancy between current and desired characteristics of CCGS perceived by community care professionals as a basis for CCGS develop decision making. We were aware of the complexity of this issue, and used a triangulated methodology in a surv ey to elicit the real perspective of users and determinants of usability more correctly and clearly. The procedure is shown in Figure 3. 
Before survey, we give a clear introduction and explanation of the research purpose to each participant, making sure they would accurately focus on what we really want. As some of the participants haven X  X  used CCGS in job for some time and some ha-ven X  X  realized the usefulness of CCGS in the past, we prepared an existing CCGS as an example to show all the participants how its functions are and how it works.

Records of what questions they asked in using, what complaints they poured out, and what suggestions they mentioned unconsciously, may reflect sort of their true perception. tured questionnaire comprising three parts that focus on different issues. Then, semi-structured questions were asked during a 30-to 45-minutes interview. We recorded field notes during the interviews using a strategy described by Schatzman and Strauss [13]. They were organized into observational notes. The combined notes were ana-lyzed by the constant comparative method in an inductive way [14]. 5.1 Description of Participants Gender 19 of 23 participants are female, other 4 are male.

CCGS 5.2 Five Factors That Most Influence the Usability of CCGS As the purpose of this research is to find out the most important criteria for measuring groupware usability of CCGS which can guide the development in a more effective 15~19] in our questionnaire and penetrate them in the topics of interview, in order to extract the important items for CCGS in the general list. From the valid response questionnaires, we carefully analyze both the quantitative and qualitative data, then get a conclusion about five important items in terms of user perspectives: -High Accuracy High correctness of the information user can get from the system, -Time Efficiency The availability of the output information at a time suitable for the -High Learnability Fast speed and high facility with which the user feels that he or 5.3 User Expectation to CCGS Besides the above five factors regarded as the most important requirements for achieving high groupware usability, qualitative results about user expectation and recommendations to CCGS are further concluded as follow: -Design CCGS for Extremes: Information systems in healthcare especially in -Use additional computing equipments: community care staff prefers to use addi--There are not many requirements on the attractiveness of interface. Community -Community care staff prefers graphical fu nctions, which are easy to read and in--Shared workspaces, files, items and chat text areas that allow multiple meetings of In this article we addresses the poor usability problem of Community Care Group-ware System (CCGS) in Australia, which make researchers in user-centered software engineering feel very hard and tied in well handling distributed shared-workspace groupware systems. We aim to find out why the adoption of CCGS in Australia is not as successful as in other industries, what the community care workers X  perspective and expectation to a usable CCGS are in their daily work, and what the most impor-tant usability factors of CCGS are. We first interpret the importance of context of use in usability, and give the specific working characteristics of community care industry in Australia. Then, a task modeling method proposed by David and Carl is introduced to assist the discount groupware usability evaluation of CCGS. Next, we conduct a survey that is supported by a triangulated research methodology comprising unstruc-tured observation, structured and semi-structured questionnaire (focus on the most important usability criteria), and unstructured interview. Five determinants that most influence the groupware usability of CCGS from user X  X  perspective, and several rele-vant suggestions that make a CCGS really usable in everyday use are elicited from data collection and analysis. We think these groupware usability guidelines will be quite significant and valuable in the future development and evaluation of CCGS.
