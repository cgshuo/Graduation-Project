 The rapidly expanding e-commerce has facilitated consumers to purchase products online. More than $156 million online product retail sales have been done in the US market during 2009 (Forrester Re-search, 2009). Most retail Web sites encourage con-sumers to write reviews to express their opinions on various aspects of the products. This gives rise to huge collections of consumer reviews on the Web. These reviews have become an important resource for both consumers and firms. Consumers com-monly seek quality information from online con-sumer reviews prior to purchasing a product, while many firms use online consumer reviews as an im-portant resource in their product development, mar-keting, and consumer relationship management. As illustrated in Figure 1, most online reviews express consumers X  overall opinion ratings on the product, and their opinions on multiple aspects of the prod-uct. While a product may have hundreds of aspects, we argue that some aspects are more important than the others and have greater influence on consumers X  purchase decisions as well as firms X  product devel-opment strategies. Take iPhone 3GS as an exam-ple, some aspects like  X  battery  X  and  X  speed , X  are more important than the others like  X  moisture sen-sor . X  Generally, identifying the important product aspects will benefit both consumers and firms. Con-sumers can conveniently make wise purchase deci-sion by paying attentions on the important aspects, while firms can focus on improving the quality of these aspects and thus enhance the product reputa-tion effectively. However, it is impractical for people to identify the important aspects from the numerous reviews manually. Thus, it becomes a compelling need to automatically identify the important aspects from consumer reviews.

A straightforward solution for important aspect identification is to select the aspects that are fre-quently commented in consumer reviews as the im-portant ones. However, consumers X  opinions on the frequent aspects may not influence their over-all opinions on the product, and thus not influence consumers X  purchase decisions. For example, most consumers frequently criticize the bad  X  signal con-nection  X  of iPhone 4 , but they may still give high overall ratings to iPhone 4 . On the other hand, some aspects, such as  X  design  X  and  X  speed , X  may not be frequently commented, but usually more impor-tant than  X  signal connection . X  Hence, the frequency-based solution is not able to identify the truly impor-tant aspects.

Motivated by the above observations, in this pa-per, we propose an effective approach to automat-ically identify the important product aspects from consumer reviews. Our assumption is that the important aspects of a product should be the as-pects that are frequently commented by consumers, and consumers X  opinions on the important aspects greatly influence their overall opinions on the prod-uct. Given the online consumer reviews of a spe-cific product, we first identify the aspects in the re-views using a shallow dependency parser (Wu et al., 2009), and determine consumers X  opinions on these aspects via a sentiment classifier. We then design an aspect ranking algorithm to identify the important aspects by simultaneously taking into account the aspect frequency and the influence of consumers X  opinions given to each aspect on their overall opin-ions. Specifically, we assume that consumer X  X  over-all opinion rating on a product is generated based on a weighted sum of his/her specific opinions on multiple aspects of the product, where the weights essentially measure the degree of importance of the aspects. A probabilistic regression algorithm is then developed to derive these importance weights by leveraging the aspect frequency and the consistency between the overall opinions and the weighted sum of opinions on various aspects. We conduct ex-periments on 11 popular products in four domains. The consumer reviews on these products are crawled from the prevalent forum Web sites (e.g., cnet.com and viewpoint.com etc.) More details of our review corpus are discussed in Section 3. The experimen-tal results demonstrate the effectiveness of our ap-proach on important aspects identification. Further-more, we apply the aspect ranking results to the ap-plication of document-level sentiment classification by carrying out the term-weighting based on the as-pect importance. The results show that our approach can improve the performance significantly.

The main contributions of this paper include, 1) We dedicate to the topic of aspect ranking, which aims to automatically identify important as-pects of a product from consumer reviews. 2) We develop an aspect ranking algorithm to identify the important aspects by simultaneously considering the aspect frequency and the influence of consumers X  opinions given to each aspect on their overall opinions. 3) We apply aspect ranking results to the applica-tion of document-level sentiment classification, and improve the performance significantly.

There is another work named aspect ranking (Snyder et al., 2007). The task in this work is differ-ent from ours. This work mainly focuses on predict-ing opinionated ratings on aspects rather than iden-tifying important aspects.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-tion 2 elaborates our aspect ranking approach. Sec-tion 3 presents the experimental results, while Sec-tion 4 introduces the application of document-level sentiment classification. Section 5 reviews related work and Section 6 concludes this paper with future works. In this section, we first present some notations and then elaborate the key components of our approach, including the aspect identification, sentiment classi-fication, and aspect ranking algorithm. 2.1 Notations and Problem Formulation Let R = { r 1 ,  X  X  X  , r |R| } denotes a set of online con-sumer reviews of a specific product. Each review r  X  X  is associated with an overall opinion rating O r , and covers several aspects with consumer com-ments on these aspects. Suppose there are m aspects A = { a R , where a k is the k -th aspect. We define o rk as the opinion on aspect a k in review r . We assume that the overall opinion rating O r is generated based on a weighted sum of the opinions on specific aspects o rk (Wang et al., 2010). The weights are denoted as {  X  rk } m k =1 , each of which essentially measures the degree of importance of the aspect a k in review r . Our task is to derive the important weights of as-pects, and identify the important aspects.

Next, we will introduce the key components of our approach, including aspect identification that identifies the aspects a k in each review r , aspect sen-timent classification which determines consumers X  opinions o rk on various aspects, and aspect ranking algorithm that identifies the important aspects. 2.2 Aspect Identification As illustrated in Figure 1, there are usually two types of reviews, Pros and Cons review and free text re-views on the Web. For Pros and Cons reviews, the aspects are identified as the frequent noun terms in the reviews, since the aspects are usually noun or noun phrases (Liu, 2009), and it has been shown that simply extracting the frequent noun terms from the Pros and Cons reviews can get high accurate aspect terms (Liu el al., 2005). To identify the as-pects in free text reviews, we first parse each review using the Stanford parser 1 , and extract the noun phrases ( NP ) from the parsing tree as aspect can-didates. While these candidates may contain much noise, we leverage the Pros and Cons reviews to assist identify aspects from the candidates. In par-ticular, we explore the frequent noun terms in Pros and Cons reviews as features, and train a one-class SVM (Manevitz et al., 2002) to identify aspects in the candidates. While the obtained aspects may con-tain some synonym terms, such as  X  earphone  X  and  X  headphone , X  we further perform synonym cluster-ing to get unique aspects. Specifically, we first ex-pand each aspect term with its synonym terms ob-tained from the synonym terms Web site 2 , and then cluster the terms to obtain unique aspects based on unigram feature. 2.3 Aspect Sentiment Classification Since the Pros and Cons reviews explicitly express positive and negative opinions on the aspects, re-spectively, our task is to determine the opinions in free text reviews. To this end, we here utilize Pros and Cons reviews to train a SVM sentiment classifier. Specifically, we collect sentiment terms in the Pros and Cons reviews as features and represent each re-view into feature vector using Boolean weighting. Note that we select sentiment terms as those appear in the sentiment lexicon provided by MPQA project (Wilson et al., 2005). With these features, we then train a SVM classifier based on Pros and Cons re-views. Given a free text review, since it may cover various opinions on multiple aspects, we first locate the opinionated expression modifying each aspect, and determine the opinion on the aspect using the learned SVM classifier. In particular, since the opin-ionated expression on each aspect tends to contain sentiment terms and appear closely to the aspect (Hu and Liu, 2004), we select the expressions which con-tain sentiment terms and are at the distance of less than 5 from the aspect NP in the parsing tree. 2.4 Aspect Ranking Generally, consumer X  X  opinion on each specific as-pect in the review influences his/her overall opin-ion on the product. Thus, we assume that the con-sumer gives the overall opinion rating O r based on the weighted sum of his/her opinion o rk on each as-pect a k :  X  r T o r , where  X  r and o r are the weight and opinion vectors. Inspired by the work of Wang et al. (2010), we view O r as a sample drawn from a Gaussian Dis-tribution , with mean  X  r T o r and variance  X  2 ,
To model the uncertainty of the importance weights  X  r in each review, we assume  X  r as a sam-ple drawn from a Multivariate Gaussian Distribu-tion , with  X  as the mean vector and  X  as the covari-ance matrix,
We further incorporate aspect frequency as a prior knowledge to define the distribution of  X  and  X  . Specifically, the distribution of  X  and  X  is defined based on its Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to a prior distribution with a mean vector  X  0 and an iden-tity covariance matrix I in Eq.3. Each element in  X  0 is defined as the frequency of the corresponding as-pect: f requency ( a k ) / p (  X  ,  X  ) = exp [  X   X   X  KL ( Q (  X  ,  X  ) || Q (  X  0 , I ))] , where KL (  X  ,  X  ) is the KL divergence, Q (  X  ,  X  ) de-notes a Multivariate Gaussian Distribution , and  X  is a tradeoff parameter.

Base on the above definition, the probability of generating the overall opinion rating O r on review r is given as, where  X  = {  X  ,  X  ,  X  ,  X  2 } are the model parameters.
Next, we utilize Maximum Log-likelihood ( ML ) to estimate the model parameters given the con-sumer reviews corpus. In particular, we aim to find an optimal  X   X  to maximize the probability of observ-ing the overall opinion ratings in the reviews corpus.  X   X  = arg max = arg min ( tr (  X  ) + (  X  0  X   X  ) T I (  X  0  X   X  )) . For the sake of simplicity, we denote the objective function
The derivative of the objective function with re-spect to each model parameter vanishes at the mini-mizer: (  X  r  X   X  ) T (  X   X  1 ) T ] } +  X   X  which lead to the following solutions:  X   X  = ( |R|  X   X  1 +  X   X  I )  X  1 (  X   X  1  X 
 X  = { [ 1  X   X   X 
We can see that the above parameters are involved in each other X  X  solution. We here utilize Alternating Optimization technique to derive the optimal param-eters in an iterative manner. We first hold the param-eters  X  ,  X  and  X  2 fixed and update the parameters  X  r for each review r parameters  X  ,  X  and  X  2 with fixed  X  r ( r  X  X  ). These two steps are alternatively iterated until the Eq.5 converges. As a result, we obtain the optimal importance weights  X  r which measure the impor-tance of aspects in review r  X  X  . We then compute the final importance score  X  k for each aspect a k by integrating its importance score in all the reviews as,
It is worth noting that the aspect frequency is con-sidered again in this integration process. According to the importance score  X  k , we can identify impor-tant aspects. In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on aspect identification, sentiment classi-fication, and aspect ranking. 3.1 Data and Experimental Setting The details of our product review data set is given in Table 1. This data set contains consumer reviews on 11 popular products in 4 domains. These reviews were crawled from the prevalent forum Web sites, including cnet.com, viewpoints.com, reevoo.com and gsmarena.com. All of the reviews were posted between June, 2009 and Sep 2010. The aspects of the reviews, as well as the opinions on the aspects were manually annotated as the gold standard for evaluations.

To examine the performance on aspect identifi-cation and sentiment classification, we employed F -measure, which was the combination of preci-sion and recall , as the evaluation metric. To evalu-ate the performance on aspect ranking, we adopted Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at top k (NDCG @k ) (Jarvelin and Kekalainen, 2002) as the performance metric. Given an aspect ranking list a ,  X  X  X  , a k , NDCG @k is calculated by where t ( i ) is the function that represents the reward given to the aspect at position i , Z is a normaliza-tion term derived from the top k aspects of a perfect ranking, so as to normalize NDCG @k to be within [0 , 1] . This evaluation metric will favor the ranking which ranks the most important aspects at the top. For the reward t ( i ) , we labeled each aspect as one of the three scores: Un-important (score 1), Ordinary (score 2) and Important (score 3). Three volunteers were invited in the annotation process as follows. We first collected the top k aspects in all the rank-ings produced by various evaluated methods (maxi-mum k is 15 in our experiment). We then sampled some reviews covering these aspects, and provided the reviews to each annotator to read. Each review contains the overall opinion rating, the highlighted aspects, and opinion terms. Afterward, the annota-tors were required to assign an importance score to each aspect. Finally, we took the average of their scorings as the corresponding importance scores of the aspects. In addition, there is only one parameter  X  that needs to be tuned in our approach. Through-out the experiments, we empirically set  X  as 0.001. 3.2 Evaluations on Aspect Identification We compared our aspect identification approach against two baselines: a) the method proposed by Hu and Liu (2004), which was based on the asso-ciation rule mining, and b) the method proposed by Wu et al. (2009), which was based on a dependency parser.

The results are presented in Table 2. On average, our approach significantly outperforms Hu X  X  method and Wu X  method in terms of F 1 -measure by over 5.87% and 3.27%, respectively. In particular, our approach obtains high precision. Such results imply that our approach can accurately identify the aspects from consumer reviews by leveraging the Pros and Cons reviews.
 3.3 Evaluations on Sentiment Classification In this experiment, we implemented the follow-ing sentiment classification methods (Pang and Lee, 2008): 1) Unsupervised method. We employed one un-supervised method which was based on opinion-ated term counting via SentiWordNet (Ohana et al., 2009). 2) Supervised method. We employed three su-pervised methods proposed in Pang et al. (2002), including Na  X   X ve Bayes ( NB ), Maximum Entropy ( ME ), SVM . These classifiers were trained based on the Pros and Cons reviews as described in Section 2.3.
The comparison results are showed in Table 3. We can see that supervised methods significantly outper-form unsupervised method. For example, the SVM classifier outperforms the unsupervised method in terms of average F 1 -measure by over 10.37%. Thus, we can deduce from such results that the Pros and Cons reviews are useful for sentiment classification. In addition, among the supervised classifiers, SVM classifier performs the best in most products, which is consistent with the previous research (Pang et al., 2002).
 3.4 Evaluations on Aspect Ranking In this section, we compared our aspect ranking al-gorithm against the following three methods. 1) Frequency-based method. The method ranks the aspects based on aspect frequency. 2) Correlation-based method. This method mea-sures the correlation between the opinions on spe-cific aspects and the overall opinion. It counts the number of the cases when such two kinds of opin-ions are consistent, and ranks the aspects based on the number of the consistent cases. 3) Hybrid method. This method captures both the aspect frequency and correlation by a linear combi-nation, as  X   X  Frequency-based Ranking + (1  X   X  )  X  Correlation-based Ranking , where  X  is set to 0.5.
The comparison results are showed in Table 4. On average, our approach outperforms the frequency-based method, correlation-based method, and hy-brid method in terms of NDCG @5 by over 6.24%, 5.79% and 5.56%, respectively. It improves the performance over such three methods in terms of NDCG @10 by over 3.47%, 2.94% and 2.58%, re-spectively, while in terms of NDCG @15 by over 4.08%, 3.04% and 3.49%, respectively. We can de-duce from the results that our aspect ranking algo-rithm can effectively identify the important aspects from consumer reviews by leveraging the aspect fre-quency and the influence of consumers X  opinions given to each aspect on their overall opinions. Ta-ble 5 shows the aspect ranking results of these four methods. Due to the space limitation, we here only show top 10 aspects of the product iphone 3GS . We can see that our approach performs better than the others. For example, the aspect  X  phone  X  is ranked at the top by the other methods. However,  X  phone  X  is a general but not important aspect.
To further investigate the reasonability of our ranking results, we refer to one of the public user feedback reports, the  X  china unicom 100 customers iPhone user feedback report  X  (Chinaunicom Report, 2009). The report demonstrates that the top four as-pects of iPhone product, which users most concern with, are  X  3G Network  X  (30%),  X  usability  X  (30%),  X  out-looking design  X  (26%),  X  application  X  (15%). All of these aspects are in the top 10 of our rank-ing results.

Therefore, we can conclude that our approach is able to automatically identify the important aspects from numerous consumer reviews. The identification of important aspects can support a wide range of applications. For example, we can provide product comparison on the important as-pects to users, so that users can make wise purchase decisions conveniently.

In the following, we apply the aspect ranking re-sults to assist document-level review sentiment clas-sification. Generally, a review document contains consumer X  X  positive/negative opinions on various as-pects of the product. It is difficult to get the ac-curate overall opinion of the whole review without knowing the importance of these aspects. In ad-dition, when we learn a document-level sentiment classifier, the features generated from unimportant aspects lack of discriminability and thus may dete-riorate the performance of the classifier (Fang et al., 2010). While the important aspects and the senti-ment terms on these aspects can greatly influence the overall opinions of the review, they are highly likely to be discriminative features for sentiment classifica-tion. These observations motivate us to utilize aspect ranking results to assist classifying the sentiment of review documents.

Specifically, we randomly sampled 100 reviews of each product as the testing data and used the remain-ing reviews as the training data. We first utilized our approach to identify the importance aspects from the training data. We then explored the aspect terms and sentiment terms as features, based on which each re-view is represented as a feature vector. Here, we give more emphasis on the important aspects and the sentiment terms that modify these aspects. In particular, we set the term-weighting as 1 +  X   X   X  k , where  X  k is the importance score of the aspect a k ,  X  is set to 100. Based on the weighted features, we then trained a SVM classifier using the training re-views to determine the overall opinions on the test-ing reviews. For the performance comparison, we compared our approach against two baselines, in-cluding Boolean weighting method and frequency weighting ( tf ) method (Paltoglou et al., 2010) that do not utilize the importance of aspects. The com-parison results are shown in Table 6. We can see that our approach ( IA ) significantly outperforms the other methods in terms of average F 1 -measure by over 2.79% and 4.07%, respectively. The results also show that the Boolean weighting method out-performs the frequency weighting method in terms of average F 1 -measure by over 1.25%, which are consistent with the previous research by Pang et al. (2002). On the other hand, from the IA weight-ing formula, we observe that without using the im-portant aspects, our term-weighting function will be equal to Boolean weighting. Thus, we can speculate that the identification of important aspects is ben-eficial to improving the performance of document-level sentiment classification. Existing researches mainly focused on determining opinions on the reviews, or identifying aspects from these reviews. They viewed each aspect equally without distinguishing the important ones. In this section, we review existing researches related to our work.

Analysis of the opinion on whole review text had been extensively studied (Pang and Lee, 2008). Ear-lier research had been studied unsupervised (Kim et al., 2004), supervised (Pang et al., 2002; Pang et al., 2005) and semi-supervised approaches (Goldberg et al., 2006) for the classification. For example, Mullen et al. (2004) proposed an unsupervised classifica-tion method which exploited pointwise mutual in-formation ( PMI ) with syntactic relations and other attributes. Pang et al. (2002) explored several ma-chine learning classifiers, including Na  X   X ve Bayes, Maximum Entropy, SVM, for sentiment classifica-tion. Goldberg et al. (2006) classified the sentiment of the review using the graph-based semi-supervised learning techniques, while Li el al. (2009) tackled the problem using matrix factorization techniques with lexical prior knowledge.

Since the consumer reviews usually expressed opinions on multiple aspects, some works had drilled down to the aspect-level sentiment analysis, which aimed to identify the aspects from the reviews and to determine the opinions on the specific aspects instead of the overall opinion. For the topic of aspect identification, Hu and Liu (2004) presented the asso-ciation mining method to extract the frequent terms as the aspects. Subsequently, Popescu et al. (2005) proposed their system OPINE , which extracted the aspects based on the KnowItAll Web information extraction system (Etzioni et al., 2005). Liu el al. (2005) proposed a supervised method based on lan-guage pattern mining to identify the aspects in the reviews. Later, Mei et al. (2007) proposed a prob-abilistic topic model to capture the mixture of as-pects and sentiments simultaneously. Afterwards, Wu et al. (2009) utilized the dependency parser to extract the noun phrases and verb phrases from the reviews as the aspect candidates. They then trained a language model to refine the candidate set, and to obtain the aspects. On the other hand, for the topic of sentiment classification on the specific as-pect, Snyder et al. (2007) considered the situation when the consumers X  opinions on one aspect could influence their opinions on others. They thus built a graph to analyze the meta-relations between opin-ions, such as agreement and contrast. And they pro-posed a Good Grief algorithm to leveraging such meta-relations to improve the prediction accuracy of aspect opinion ratings. In addition, Wang et al. (2010) proposed the topic of latent aspect rating which aimed to infer the opinion rating on the as-pect. They first employed a bootstrapping-based al-gorithm to identify the major aspects via a few seed word aspects. They then proposed a generative La-tent Rating Regression model (LRR) to infer aspect opinion ratings based on the review content and the associated overall rating.

While there were usually huge collection of re-views, some works had concerned the topic of aspect-based sentiment summarization to combat the information overload. They aimed to summa-rize all the reviews and integrate major opinions on various aspects for a given product. For example, Titov et al. (2008) explored a topic modeling method to generate a summary based on multiple aspects. They utilized topics to describe aspects and incor-porated a regression model fed by the ground-truth opinion ratings. Additionally, Lu el al. (2009) pro-posed a structured PLSA method, which modeled the dependency structure of terms, to extract the as-pects in the reviews. They then aggregated opinions on each specific aspects and selected representative text segment to generate a summary.

In addition, some works proposed the topic of product ranking which aimed to identify the best products for each specific aspect (Zhang et al., 2010). They used a PageRank style algorithm to mine the aspect-opinion graph, and to rank the prod-ucts for each aspect.

Different from previous researches, we dedicate our work to identifying the important aspects from the consumer reviews of a specific product. In this paper, we have proposed to identify the im-portant aspects of a product from online consumer reviews. Our assumption is that the important as-pects of a product should be the aspects that are fre-quently commented by consumers and consumers X  opinions on the important aspects greatly influence their overall opinions on the product. Based on this assumption, we have developed an aspect ranking al-gorithm to identify the important aspects by simulta-neously considering the aspect frequency and the in-fluence of consumers X  opinions given to each aspect on their overall opinions. We have conducted exper-iments on 11 popular products in four domains. Ex-perimental results have demonstrated the effective-ness of our approach on important aspects identifi-cation. We have further applied the aspect ranking results to the application of document-level senti-ment classification, and have significantly improved the classification performance. In the future, we will apply our approach to support other applications. This work is supported in part by NUS-Tsinghua Ex-treme Search (NExT) project under the grant num-ber: R-252-300-001-490.
