 Though the RFID technology is being developed actively and lots of efforts made to Brother X . So, it is needed to develop technologies for information and privacy protec-OIS, ODS, OTS, etc.). The current excessive limitations to RFID tags and readers make it impossible to apply present codes and protocols. The technology for informa-tion and privacy protection should be developed in terms of general interconnection among elements and their characteristics of RFID in order to such technology that meets the RFID circumstances. 
While common RFID technologies are used in B2B models like supply channels, distribution, logistics management, mobile RFID technologies are used in the RFID reader attached to an individual owner's cellular phone through which the owner can collect and use information of objects by r eading their RFID tags; in case of corpora-most of current RFID application services are used in fields like the search of movies posters and provision of information in galleries where less security needs are required, they will be expanded to and used more frequently in such fields like tection are indispensible. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the multilateral ap-proaches to the mobile RFID security problem using web service which complies with the Korea X  X  mobile RFID forum standard. This is new technology to RFID will provide a solution to protecting absolute confidentiality from basic tags to user X  X  privacy information. 2.1 Networked Mobile RFID Technology RFID is expected to be the base technology for ubiquitous network or computing, and to be associated with other technology such as telemetric, and sensors. The mobile phone integrated with RFID can activate new markets and end-user services, and can be considered as an exemplary technology fusion. Furthermore, it may evolve its functions as end-user terminal device, or  X  X -device (ubiquitous device) X , in the world of ubiquitous information technology. 
Networked RFID means an expanded RFID network and communication scope to communicate with a series of networks, inter-networks and globally distributed appli-cation systems. So it makes global communication relationships triggered by RFID, for such applications as B2B, B2C, B2B2C, G2C, etc. Networked RFID loads a com-pact RFID reader in a cellular phone, prov iding diverse services through mobile tele-communications networks when reading RFID tags through a cellular phone. Internet-enabled mobile phone which equips RFID reader will bring new service concepts to mobile telecommunication. Networked RFID technology is focusing on the UHF range (860~960MHz), since UHF range may enable longer reading range and moderate data rates as well as rela-lected service domain the UHF RFID phone device can be used for providing object information directly to the end-user using the same UHF RFID tags which have widely spread. The service area of networked RFID is expected to be unlimited, and its services, diverse; currently, however, the service scenarios using RFID tags chiefly as offline hypertext owing to the constraints of cellular phone performance and busi-ness models are still at the proposal stage. 2.2 Mobile RFID X  X  Wireless Specifications For a mobile terminal with an RFID read er embedded, the configuration of reader chip are two components: the digital component, which processes Host/RFID proto-cols, and the analog component, which processes base band signals and 900MHz RF signals. 
To eliminate the analog component from the design, it is necessary to prepare cor-responding wireless specifications for it. This paper prepared the domestic wireless specifications for mobile RFID in Korea, in reference to applicable RFID frequency, cell radius, channel allocation, and relevant radio regulation acts (ordinances), techni-cal standards, etc. 
In general, the minimum power to be delivered to a passive RFID tag is -10dBm (100uW). On the contrary, since a mobile RFID terminal has good accessibility to tags, it can fully meet the requirements for application in mobile RFID services, if any signal output of a mobile RFID should be at least 20dBm or higher, in overall consid-eration of link loss = -315dB, tag antenna gain  X  2dBi, built-in reader antenna gain  X  0dBi, and more. However, a mobile RFID cannot emit as much output as a fixed type reader because it works only with power supplied from a mobile phone battery. Thus, our wireless specifications determined the sender output by allowing for minimum power based on link analysis, limitations of CMOS power amplifier, and the mobile phone X  X  battery power. 
On the other hand, it is not necessary for mobile RFID to recognize a massive number of tags at once since it is designed primarily for the reader X  X  portability. The Mobile RFID has to just request and send information on several tag recognition 40Kbps without difficulty. In Korea, the frequency band allocated for RFID ranges from 908.5MHz to 914MHz. The RFID device supports data rates as high as 640Kbps at this band and can communicate with other terminals only if a wide channel band-width is available in the restricted area. It is not appropriate for terminals like mobile RFID that may be used by an uncertain number of multiple users. Therefore, the mo-bile RFID was based on 200 KHz channel bandwidth at data rate of about 40Kbps. 2.3 Network Architecture of the Mobile RFID Networked RFID services are provided by using mobile telecommunication network and typical Internet. Figure 2 shows the interface structure for MRFID service X  X  communication infrastructure and the types of relevant standards. The RFID wireless access communication takes place between RFID tag and cellular phone, CDMA mobile communication takes place between cellular phone and BTS/ANTS, and the wire communication takes place between BTS/ANTS and networked RFID application server. 
Networked RFID service structure is defined to support ISO/IEC 18000-6 A/B/C through the wireless access communication between RFID tag and the RFID reader, but there is no RFID reader chip supporti ng all three wireless connection access speci-termined by the mobile communication companies. It will be also possible to mount the RF wireless communication function to the reader chip using SDR technology and develop ISO/IEC 18000-6 A/B/C communication protocol in software to choose from protocols when needed. Networked terminal X  X  function is concerned with the recognition distance to the RFID reader chip built into the cellular phone, transmission power, frequency, inter-face, technological standard, PIN speci fication, UART communication interface, WIPI API and WIPI-HAL API extended speci fication to control reader chip. RFID reader chip middleware functions are provided to the application program in the form of WIPI API. Here, mobile RFID device driver is the device driver software provided by the reader chip manufacturer. 
Networked network function is concerned with the communication protocols such as the ODS communication for code interpretation, the message transmission for the transmission and reception of contents between the cellular phone terminal and the application server, contents negotiation that supports networked RFID service envi-ronment and ensures the optimum contents transfer between the cellular phone termi-nal and the application server, and session management that enables the application to create and mange required status information while transmitting the message and the WIPI extended specification which supports these communication services. 
Cellular phone requires a common control interface between various RFID readers functions that RFID reader has to commonly support as well as various common command and standardizing message types. Mobile RFID functions will be extended continuously into standard cellular phone RFID reader, and the RFID supported WIPI extension model using WIPI which is the wireless internet standard platform will API extension of WIPI which is the wireless internet standard platform while main-taining compatibility among various devices. First, mobile RFID phone reads RFID tags on object and fetches code stored in it. Second, mobile RFID phone should do code resolution with which mobile RFID or adequate mobile service. Code resolution protocol is identical with DNS protocol. ODS (Object Directory Service) server in figure 3 acts DNS server and is like EP-Cglobal X  X  ONS (Object Name Service) server. Mobile RFID phone queries the loca-the server. Finally, mobile RFID phone requests contents or service to the designated server acquired from ODS server. 
ODS server plays a role of DNS server which informs the mobile RFID phone of the contents/service server X  X  location as explained above. ODS server may be organ-ized in hierarchical structure similar to DNS server. The OTS (Object Traceability Service) server keeps history of tag reading in RFID readers throughout the lifecycle of objects. Its main purpose is for tracking object in SCM. The OIS (Object Informa-tion Service) records the reading RFID tag event to OTS server and may provide additional information of an object in detail such as manufactured time, manufacturer name, expiration time, etc. The RPS (RFID Privacy management Server) controls access to information of the object in accordance with privacy profile which owner of the object makes up. WAP and Web server are content servers providing wireless Inter-net contents such as news, game, music, video, stock trading, lottery, images and so on. 2.4 Previous Works For realization of networked RFID services, it is required that RFID devices such as RFID tag or RFID reader should be installed to mobile phones. The Nokia phone support RFID technology based on 13.56MHz, and ISO 14443A. This Nokia phone is based on NFC protocol that uses 13.56MHz complying with ISO/IEC 18092. Mobile logging time-stamped data like meter readings. KDDI in Japan developed slide-in RFID readers that can be easily attached to the back side of a mobile phone. There are two types of RFID reader according to frequency band. One is 2.45GHz passive type and the other is 315MHz active type. Some pilot tests were scheduled in March 2005. Location-based services with RFID equipped mobile devices are being tested e.g. in Japan. RFID tags are placed in public venues; pedestrians may then use handheld devices to obtain additional information on their surroundings. Table 1 shows the summary of mobile RFID implementations. 
As shown above, Korea X  X  networked RFID uses 908.55 ~ 913.95MHz and com-plies with ISO/IEC 18000-6 type B and C. UHF band has advantages as follows: -Relatively longer range up to 100cm : Longer range is favourable to most mobile -Short range available up to 2 or 3cm : If needed in case of payment system, short -Avoiding duplicate investment for RFID tag : Most RFID tags in SCM work in Web service, even though it has been commonly available for quite some time, it has service has evolved steadily and occupies its own position as a very critical technol-ogy for the next generation. 
Web service is a basic technology for system interlocking among different plat-forms distributed on a network by means of existing technologies used on the web. Its compatibility or scalability is based on XML. Actually, there is not any one technol-ogy called web service, but web service is realized through arranging basic technolo-gies for different purposes, such as SOAP, WDSL and UDDI. 
The connection between RFID and web service has recently been highlighted be-cause the web service may provide a solution for development problems associated with the RFID system. Indeed, RFID has nothing firsthand to do with web service. RFID system, fundamentally because of the following reasons, although those prob-lems can all be resolved with the help of web service: 1) Reader has too low level control of API. 2) There is not yet any proven way to control the reader via network. 3) There is not yet any established method to manage and monitor the reader when 
If the RFID system is operated without any knowledge of reader failure, the stock amount or the like may not be indicated on the system correctly, possibly resulting in excessive orders. The web service itself runs on a web server so there are lots of tools these tools may be applied to management of the RFID reader. However, no matter management, it has little use in applications. 
The advantages of using web service for RFID system go beyond this simple man-agement of the reader. For example, using web service for RFID system makes it very easy to take security measures such as encoding communicated data or restricting access. For web service, SSL makes it easy to encode what is communicated and even authenticate IP address through a firewall as well. It is not necessary to develop inde-pendent password (cipher) processing or set up an access control module. In addition, load sharing process for access congestion, anal ysis of transactions based on timeline and more can be easily carried out through conventional software or hardware. Above all, it is important that there is no limitation of accessibility from all platforms. Only one service can make it possible to deal with any request from all platforms, without preparing different drivers, etc. for a variety of platforms. Summing up, web service can solve the inevitable challenges in developing the RFID system, which cannot be resolved with conventional technologies, and contrib-ute greatly to improving development efficiency and reducing costs. 4.1 Multilateral Approaches to the Mobile RFID Security Problem This technology aims at RFID application se rvices like authentication of tag, reader, and owner, privacy protection, and non-trackable payment system where more strict security is needed. 1) Approach of Platform Level 2) Approach of Protocol Level -It assists Write and Kill passwords provided by EPC Class1 Gen2 for mobile -It employs information protection technology solving the security vulnerability 3) Approach of Privacy Level 4.2 Secure Mobile Application Po rtal in Web Service Environment The mobile RFID is a technology for de veloping a RFID reader embedded in a mo-bile terminal and providing various application services over wireless networks. Vari-ous security issues -Interdomain security, privacy, authentication, E2E (End-to-End) mobile RFID. Model of mobile RFID service as shown in figure 4 defines additional three entities and two relationships compared to that defined in RFID tag, RFID ac-cess network, RFID reader, relation between RFID tag and RFID reader, relation between RFID reader and application server. Generally, in mobile RFID application such as smart poster, Application Service Provider (ASP) has the ownership of RFID tags. Thus, mobile RFID users have to subscribe to both the ASP for these kinds of RFID services and mobile network op-erator for mobile communication service. Namely, there exist three potentially dis-trusted parties: user owned RFID reader, mobile network operator, and ASP. Accord-ingly, trust relationship among three parties must be established to realize secure mobile RFID service. Especially, when a RF ID reader tries to read or change RFID service data stored in tag, the reader needs to get a tag access rights. Additionally, it is important that new tag access rights whenever some readers access a same tag must be different from the already accessed old one. Secure mobile RFID application portal is a secure service portal for various mobile RFID application services. The service provider using SMAP (Secure Mobile Appli-cation Portal) can easily deploy several mobile RFID applications guaranteed with security and privacy protection. 
Secure portal discovery service gateway is a system that classifies and defines the mobile OIS system as an individual element system in a mobile RFID security appli-cation service network, and also supports internal functions comprising each element service system. This gateway system manages the locations and interface of servers and services as registered from applicable product and service providers that provide product information and contents corresponding to each EPC. Moreover, this system works as a gateway system that seeks appropriate services with the capacity to pro-vide information on any product equipped with a tag containing applicable EPC or and wireless device (particularly, mobile RFID reader terminals) of users who access mobile RFID service network. 
This portal allows you to find out off-line product information on an EPC, on-line additional service information, information on authentication for product family or product related to this EPC, and more. This gateway system also has another advan-tage -applying a privacy policy and security to personal information for inquiry about information in the interest of creating a secured and reliable environment for making information available. Additional features of this system include automatically gener-ating and managing OIS for the mobile RFID. This function allows you to create and use a variety of useful functions, such as database for managing information corre-encoding, etc; data exchange for sharing necessary information among OISs; and interface generation and management for user and external application to use the OIS. 
As a mobile RFID object information service module, mOIS offers information on any object, and works for system management or commissioned management and administration. By means of interlocking with the gateway system, manufacturer OIS, application retailer's mOIS, and mOIS for additional service providers can provide services via the user's RFID reader terminal. 
The RFID privacy service component consists of several elements, such as the se-cure communicator for communication with RPS server; PPP (Privacy Profile Proc-essing) Controller for dealing with privacy policy profile, audit log policy and whether to execute duties; RPS Decision Point to determine possible coverage of RPS Data Generator to generate audit log and results of executing duties. As mentioned above, mobile RFID is a newly promising application using RFID RFID service in retail and supply chain will cause some additional security threats. In this paper, we tried to introduce the concept of mobile RFID, combination of Web service and RFID, and expose some additional security threats caused by it. The frequency band to support the air protocol is allocated at 908.5MHz to 914MHz by TTA (Telecommunication Technology Association) in Korea to comply with ISO 18000-6 for air interface communications at 860MHz to 960MHz. And we describe a external security reading device (replacing 900MHz) and same time as an added security service based on web service to manage all RFID mobile device mediums. sented. By doing so, the customized security and privacy protection can be achieved solution for security and privacy protection in a networked mobile RFID system based on web service.
