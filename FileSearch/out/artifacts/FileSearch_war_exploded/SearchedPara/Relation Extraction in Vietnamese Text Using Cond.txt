The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents recent studies on the CRF, the training and inference in CRF. Section 4 discusses the RE problem for Vietnamese text and our solution to this problem. Section 5 analyzes our experimental results. Finally, our conclusions and future work are given in Section 6. Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields [1, 2], Maximum Entropy Mod-els [5], Support Vector Machines [3, 4, 12, 13]. Organization -Location, Person -Location, and Person -Person in documents based on a kernel method, using shallow language processing such as tokenization, sentence using in this approach are: the context be tween the two entities (before, between, and after the two entities), lexicon, POS tag, bag-of-word, entity, chunk types, and Word-Net synsets. 
Culotta et al. [2] used the CRF for relation extraction. The purpose is to predict re-word window of the target token), lexicons (such as whether a token appears in a list offset conjunctions (combinations of adjacent features within a window of size six).

For example, the Nobel Prize&gt; . The features used in O-CRF are POS tag, context words, and a connec-and determiner), not Noun or Verb. 
Skounakis et al. [10] used Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (HHMM) to ex-context words. Kambhatla [5] employed Maximum Entropy models for relation ex-traction with features derived from word, entity type, mention level, overlap, depend-ency tree and parse tree. 
There are several research on information extraction in Vietnamese. However, tify relation between entities in question of a question answering system. Based on a set of basic examples (called seeds) for each relation, the system in [11] repeatly car-uses Google search engine to get snippets that contain new seeds. To identify relation The relation that the pattern belongs to is the relation that question asks about. tween two entities as a signal to detect relations and by considering the RE problem as used as assumption about state dependency.

RE can be reduced to the prob-lem of assigning one label in 5*2+1 =11 labels to each token. For example, the sen-N  X  i/ Hanoi  X  has a Per_Loc relation, then this sentence can be labeled as  X  X  O O O O B_R_Per_Loc I_R_Per_Loc O O X . 3.1 Definition of Conditional Random Field conditional probability [8].

When the training labels make the state sequence unambiguous (as they often do in there are no local maxima, and thus finding the global optimum is guaranteed. It has more efficient than traditional iterative scaling and even conjugate gradient [8, 9]. 3.3 Inference in CRF Inference in CRF is to find the most probably state sequence y* corresponding to the given observation sequence x. In order to find y*, one can apply the dynamic programming technique with a slightly modified version of the original Viterbi algorithm for HMMs. derives relations between these entities including Per_Loc, Per_Pos, Per_Org. In the scope of this research, only relations within a sentence are considered. Let us look at the nature of these relations expressed in Vietnamese sentences first. 4.1 Relations in Vietnamese Entity relations in Vietnamese sentences can be expressed in several ways. In most of cases are shown below. Case 1: The main verb phrase in a sentence signals a relation. Simplified pattern: E1 &lt;verb phrase&gt; E2 Example 1: (E2).

Simplified pattern: E1 &lt; , | : | -&gt; E2 E3 &lt;remaining text&gt; Example 3: Kim S  X  n l X  n  X  i d  X  ch l X y lan nhanh nh  X  t.

Example 3 above is also an example for Case 3, in which the Position entity is ad-jacent to the Organization entity. Case 4: Two entities are separated by another entity.

The following conclusions are withdrawn from the about cases:  X  them, are important factors in finding the relation between two entities.  X  other entities in the sentence is also an important signal. tween entities are shown in Table 1. 4.2 Relation Extraction 4.2.1 Training have been annotated. An example of the training documents is shown below: Example 6: N B X ch khoa H X  N  X  i&lt;/Org:3&gt;. ogy&lt;/Org:3&gt;. N  X  i/ Hanoi University of Technology  X . working at X  signals a Per-Org relation between the first entity and the third entity. 
The training documents is first parsed by a POS tagger to separate documents into words and to get the syntactic role of words in the sentences. Then different features sizes of the contextual information to the system performance, different window sizes the word itself, and n words on the right of the current word. In our experiment, n is chosen to be equal of 2, 4, 6, and 8. 4.2.2 Inference process. These sentences are first analyzed by a POS tagger. Then they are parsed by the CRF inference module using features mentioned in Table 1. Our experiments used a data set of 720 Vietnamese sentences taken from VnExpress annotated manually. Each of these sentences has at least two entities and one relation. Per_Loc, Per_Pos, and Per_Org relations are used in the data set, in which the number of examples for each relation are 240, 260, and 220, respectively. When learning one relation, positive examples of other relations are considered as negative examples for the relation being learned (see Example 6). 
The data set of each relation was randomly partitioned into six subsets of equal size (in number of sentences). Five subsets were used for training and the remaining sub-set was used for testing. Only relations wi thin a sentence are considered. The experi-ments were repeated five times. The performances (Precision P, Recall R, and F-score F) reported in this paper are the average results over these experiments. 
The window sizes of n words on the left and n words on the right of the current word this feature. 
Table 2 shows the highest F-score of the relation Per_Org when using information about the Position entity is received at the window size of 5 (n=2) and the lowest one of recognizing the Per_Org relation. 
Table 3 also proves that information about the Organization entity increases the ac-curacy of recognizing the Per_Pos relation. 
Table 4 shows the average F-score of the Per_Loc relation when using information using such information only adds noise to the system. 
There are two important conclusions withdrawing from our experiments. First, it is Previous works on relation extractions for English using CRF often used the window system. 
Second, some entity types can be used as signals to detect relations between other entities. The application of the OutR_Entity feature increases the system perfomance in such cases. In other cases, it will reduce the system performance. 
The closest research to this paper is [1] and [11]. The differences between Banko and Etzioni X  X  research [1] and ours are: (i ) Banko and Etzioni X  X  work do not need any (preposition, determiner) , whereas our context words can also be verbs or nouns; and relation name in our research. 
Since Banko and Etzioni [1] do not use the same corpus as ours, we cannot com-pare directly the performance of the two sy stems. Banko and Etzioni [1] received the WonAward. However, the average recall of this system is quite low (18.4%). give the answer. Since relations used in [11] are different than ours, we cannot com-pare the two systems. This paper represented a relation extraction system for Vietnamese text using Condi-tional Random Fields. The features used in the system are word, POS tag, entity type, tested in our experiments. It shown that the window size is an important factor to the system accuracy. The experiments also indicated that the window size is not directly proportional to the F-score of the system. 
We also investigated the effect of information about other entities (OutR_Entity) in recognizing the relation between two entities in the same sentence. It shown that the system performance increases in case OutR_Entity can signal the relation. We also investigate other features to increase the system performance. In addition, we also would like to test the system with a larger corpus in order to get a more accurate evaluation of the system. Acknowledgments.
