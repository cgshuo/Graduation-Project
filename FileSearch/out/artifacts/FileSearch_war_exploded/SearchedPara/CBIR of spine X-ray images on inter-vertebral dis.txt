Manually finding reference images from a large image database is a tedious and error prone process. An automatic CBIR ital libraries, on the World Wide Web, and other applications such as trademark search [2]. Research on medical image medical images from a heterogeneous collection (images of different anatomy, modality, and detail) with little importance and detail) with particular focus on the localized pathology. Our research [9] has been of the latter category.
Retrieval of medical images started with text-based retrieval and has grown to include image content-based retrieval with explosive growth in the acquisition and use of biomedical images. Mao and Chu [10] studied the vector space model (VSM) to automatically retrieve medical documents. Following the development of image processing and computer vision this field.
 The Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, an intramural R&amp;D division of the National Library of
Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), maintains an archive of digitized spine X-rays collected from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES II) [12] which can serve as a reference collection
Many of these disc space characteristics can be computed from disc shape profiles. In this paper, we present an approach that combines disc shape profile with computed inter-vertebral disc space features and uses voting consensus for finding of clustering ensemble based machine learning methods [1,14 X 17] .

The proposed algorithm and DSN similarity measures are discussed in Section 2. Feature ranking for weight computation results and analysis are presented in Section 5. Conclusions and future directions are described in Section 6. 2. DSN features selected for similarity measurement
X-ray images from the NHANES II data set used for this study are segmented using active contour segmentation method represented by 36 points. More points are used for the anterior side because it has more anatomical importance than the respectively. 2.1. Mean and standard deviation of vertebra distance where ( x c , y c ) are the coordinates of the centroid, and ( x formed and is divided into three segments. These sections include two segments in the interior of these vertebrae from the centroids to the edges of vertebrae and the middle segment in the inter-vertebral area (darkened line). The length of represent the degree of DSN. 2.2. Vertebra skewness
The asymmetry in the disc space is computed as Skewness using polar coordinates that have previously been applied in shape representation and analysis [18,19] . It is computed as the difference between the inter-vertebral distance between anterior and posterior  X  X  X orners X  using the 9-point model. Two short line segments can be formed by connecting the two anterior corners and the two posterior corners. The center line, also shown in Fig. 2 , can then be formed by connecting origin and the X-axis, the skewness of DSN is calculated as: where larly, h rb is the angular measurement between the posterior-superior corner of the lower vertebra and the origin. Corre-spondingly, h lt and h lb can be computed similarly. All angular measurements are calculated using Eq. (3). The Skewness measure is positive when the short line segment on the right is longer than the one on the left. Otherwise, the Skewness is negative. 2.3. Normalized inertias
Besides the three features mentioned above which directly describe distance and skewness of the disk space, three shape interpolated to form an enclosed contour for upper and lower vertebrae, respectively. An anterior line segment is formed ized inertia [20] of order 2 is adopted. For the disk space region R given as: where ^ r is the centroid of R d and V d is the number of pixels in region R rotation. I ( R d ,2) is used as the fourth feature to describe the disk space for retrieval.
Similarly, we adopt normalized inertia to describe shape property of the whole upper and lower vertebrae. Although and

 sets into two classes (normal disk space and DSN). GMM is one of many statistically mature methods commonly used for clustering. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm [30] is used to determine the maximum likelihood parameters of a mixture of 2 Gaussians in the feature space.

The distribution of a random variable X 2 R d is a mixture of k Gaussians if its density function is: such that the parameter set h  X f a j ; l j ; R j g k j  X  1 where l j 2 R d and R j is a d d positive definite matrix.

Given a set of vectors x 1 , x 2 , ... , x n , the maximum likelihood estimation of h is: a new parameter set for each iteration according to the following two steps.

The term x ij is the posterior probability that the feature vector x distribution.

Generally, CBIR system retrieves images by comparing the query image against images in the database using similarity measures. Voting consensus has shown success in clustering ensemble [14], object classification [15], and information image. These clusters can be deemed as semantic groups. This paper presents a voting consensus mechanism to achieve a ilarity measure from different perspectives. Using voting consensus for a query inter-vertebral disc, Q associate every retrieved image to its semantic category, K -means clustering [32] is used to partition these M retrieved images into K ( K 6 M ) clusters.
 query disc, Q 0 , are chosen as new queries ( Q 1 , Q 2 , ... , Q as the similarity measures, M images most similar to each of these N new queries can, then, be retrieved. other set of retrieval result using the original query Q 0 similarity ranking list, where, the top ranked image is most similar to the query image and the image ranked at position
M is least similar to the query image. The voting process is performed according to the procedure below.

This list may be further reduced for application purposes. Fig. 3 shows the framework of the proposed algorithm using two sets of features. 5. Results
A set of 801 cervical and 972 lumbar vertebral outlines (shapes) segmented from a total of 400 digitized spine X-ray images was used for performance evaluation. Ten disc pairs of both cervical and lumbar shapes were selected randomly from the C3 X  X 4 pair, 2 discs from the C4 X  X 5 pair, 3 discs from the C5 X  X 6 pair, and 2 discs from the C6 X  X 7 vertebrae pair were selected as queries. Five of these query shapes had osteophytes. One of them had slight osteophytes and two were had slight osteophytes and one was moderate and two were severe.

Twenty queries comprising of: 10 discs from pairs of cervical and lumbar vertebrae outlines, respectively, were used in 200 vertebrae pairs for cervical and lumbar vertebrae queries, respectively. 5.1. Experiment design
Using these data, four retrieval experiments were conducted. First, only three features ( mean and standard deviation of iments used Procrustes distance to measure similarity between corresponding inferior and superior profiles as a comple-mentary assistance for accurate retrieval.

For the second and fourth experiments, three or six features and voting consensus were used to generate N + 1 sets of iments help to understand if voting consensus improves retrieval accuracy based on DSN properties. Comparing the last two experiments helps to prove that additional shape related properties and the proposed feature ranking and weighting pro-cesses improve retrieval accuracy even further. 5.2. Retrieval results
Retrieval results using mean and standard deviation of distance and skewness with equal weights were presented in our without ( Fig. 4 ) and with ( Fig. 5 ) feature ranking and weighting and voting consensus are shown to demonstrate the pairs were used for both experiments.

The cervical query disk space shows the characteristics that middle section of the disk space has larger gap than the end sample retrieval results, a layperson, can verify the method appears to perform as desired. It is necessary, however, for trained eyes to evaluate its performance. 5.3. Performance evaluation
Recall and precision are commonly used as measures of image retrieval performance. They are defined in the equations below: where D is the number of retrievals marked as good matches to the query and D not similar to the query. D M is the number of good matches in the database. The precision measured here is for the retrieval system as a whole, which is the combination of the similarity measure and voting consensus, rather than the matching algorithm alone. Recall was not used to evaluate the performance because each query pair must have its matches and non-matches identified in the database in order to establish the ground truth. This means for each query pair all 900 pairs must be reviewed, which is almost an impossible task for the radiologist to perform. Although there exist more complete methods to evaluate the performance of a retrieval system [35], using only  X  X  X recision X  measure-ment for our work is sufficient.
 posed algorithm was 82.25%, which showed an improvement over 77% from direct retrieval without voting consensus [33]. 6. Conclusion
This paper presents a novel approach for content-based retrieval of vertebra pairs using spatial, geometrical, and shape constraints applied to inter-vertebral disc space and using both the 9-point model familiar to radiologists and bone mor-phometrists and the computationally meaningful 36-point vertebral shape profiles. The mean and standard deviation of disc space distances and skewness measures are used as the spatial and geometrical properties of DSN. Furthermore, features such as normalized inertias, disk space characteristics between upper and lower vertebra are extracted as similarity mea-properties allows the proposed method also to be used for CBIR applications.
