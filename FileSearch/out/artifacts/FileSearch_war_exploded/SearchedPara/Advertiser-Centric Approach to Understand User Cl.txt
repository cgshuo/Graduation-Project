 Sponsored search is the major business model of commercial search engines. The number of clicks on ads is a key indicator of success for both advertisers and search engines, and increasing ad clicks is a goal of both of them. Many existing works stand on the view of search engines concerning how to help search engines to earn more revenue by accurately predicting ad clicks. Unlike the exist-ing works, this paper aims at understanding user clicks on ads from  X  X he view of advertisers", in order to help advertisers to improve their ad quality and therefore advertising effectiveness. To do this, a factor graph model is proposed, which considers two advertiser-controllable factors to understand user click behaviors: the rele-vance between a query and an ad, which has been well studied in previous literatures, and the  X  X ttractiveness X  of the ad, which is a newly-proposed concept. The proposed model can be used to pre-dict user clicks and also to mine a set of attractive words that could be leveraged to improve the quality of the ads. We have verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real-world datasets, through quantitative evaluations and informative case studies.

Sponsored search is the prevalent revenue source of major search engines, and search engines and advertisers would like to see more clicks on ads. To obtain more clicks, the first step is to understand why users click on ads or understand user click behaviors. Exist-ing works investigates user click behaviors on ads from the view of search engines [4, 11]. However, the analyses on user click behav-iors do not directly help advertisers improve their ads, since many factors used in click prediction cannot be accessible and controlled by advertisers. Unlike the existing works, we look at the problem

 results and demonstrates several examples of attractive words and ads. Section 5 concludes our study.
Relevance between a query and an ad is an important factor to explain user click behaviors in sponsored search [10, 8]. However, some ads matching the query well still have relatively low click rates while other ads not exactly matching the query in their de-scriptions obtain many clicks [2, 9]. These observations imply the existence of other important factors beyond relevance which influ-ence user click behaviors.

We conducted a user study to better understand this situation by asking users for the reason why they choose ads less relavant than other ads. Twenty users participated in the study, and their feed-back shows that user click behaviors are easily affected by special words in the ad, which are very attractractive to the users. Exam-ples of such words include  X  X ree",  X  X reat", and  X  X ave". Therefore, we propose the concept of  X  X ttractiveness X , which means how at-tractive an ad or a word in the ad is to a user and how likely the ad will attract user X  X  click. In other words, if two ads have similar degree of relevance, it is more likely that a user will notice the one with a larger attractiveness score and click on it.

The idea of attractiveness is somehow similar to that of  X  X all-to-action X  in marketing 1 . There are some differences between attrac-tiveness and call-to-action: 1) The latter is binary: a word/phrase is either a call-to-action word/phrase or not; while the former mea-sures the degree that a word (or an ad) attracts users X  attention. 2) Call-to-action words are mostly verbs; while attractive words can be with different POS tags, as will be demonstrated in the experi-ment section.

Given that both relevance and attractiveness are important to ex-plain user click behaviors, we consider both of them to obtain in-depth understanding of user clicks. Note that both relevance (e.g., inserting query words into ad title/description) and attractiveness (e.g., using attractive words to compose an ad) are controllable fac-tors for advertisers.
We propose a factor graph model (Fig. 2) to understand user click behaviors. In this graph, the node c represents whether an ad is clicked (c=1) or not (c=0), and we define the click probability using a logistic function: where s is the click score: a larger click score means that the ad is more likely clicked by users.

The score s depends on the relevance score r and the attractive-ness score a of the ad, and we define the probability p ( s | r,a,w c ) using a Gaussian distribution: where w c is the weight vector and  X  c is a hyper parameter control-ling the precision, and we assume that the weight vector w c has a Gaussian prior, w c  X  N (  X  c , X  c ) .

Given r and a , we can estimate the click probability as follows. http://lyrishq.lyris.com/index.php/Email-Marketing/8-Tips-for-a-Stronger-Call-to-Action.html where p ( a i | w a ,x a i ) is N ( &lt; w a ,x a i &gt;, X  a i ) .
If the prior of weight vector w a is known, we can estimate the probability of the attractiveness score for a word as follows.
We assume that the attractiveness score of an ad is a Gaussian random variable, and takes the sum of each word X  X  attractiveness tiveness score of an ad, a i is the attractiveness score of the i -th word in the ad, and  X  a is a hyperparameter.

Combining with the word-level attractiveness model, according to the factor graph, we have p ( a, { a i } n i =1 ,w a | x a ) = p ( a |{ a i } n i =1 )( Y where x a = { x a i } n i =1 , and n is the number of words in the ad. By marginalizing { a i } n i =1 and w a , the probability of the attractiveness score of an ad can be computed as below.
The probability of a click given the relevance features x r and the word-level attractiveness features x a can be written as below.
In this model, the parameters,  X  r , X  r , X  a , X  a , X  c , X  c , are learned from training data [5]. We use Infer.Net [6] to learn the parameters by likelihood maximization.

After learning the parameters, we can infer the most likely at-tractiveness score of a new word or a new ad as follows: where p ( a i | x a i ) is defined in Eqn (7), and where p ( a | x a ) is defined in Eqn (9).
We conduct experiments on the sponsored search log obtained from a commercial search engine to evaluate the proposed method. We used two-weeks sponsored search logs, with the first week for training and the second week for test. In our experiments, we con-sider six categories of queries: computers, games, health, society, recreation, and sports. For each sample query randomly selected from each category, we only consider the ads that have been shown in search result pages since the ads that have not been shown in search result pages cannot affect user click behavior.
With the learned model, we can infer the click probability for each ad-query pair using its relevance features and word-level at-tractiveness features. Then we use this probability to rank all the ads related to a query in the test set. We use Precision-recall (P-R) curves to measure the accuracy of the method [1, 9]. For compari-son, we also trained a model using only the relevance features. We
In this paper, we analyze user click behaviors in sponsored search from advertisers X  view. We propose a factor graph model to dis-cover how relevance and attractiveness affect user clicks. Our study shows that attractiveness can enhance relevance to explain user click behaviors. Furthermore, our model can estimate the attrac-tiveness score of each word and each ad, which can serve as a use-ful reference for advertisers to improve their ads so as to attract more clicks.

There are several aspects to further investigate in the future. First, we will enhance the accuracy of our model by using more advanced features. Second, we plan to investigate more novel way to help ad-vertisers based on the concept of attractiveness. i.e., how to auto-matically help advertisers optimize their ads, which is clearly more useful for advertisers.
