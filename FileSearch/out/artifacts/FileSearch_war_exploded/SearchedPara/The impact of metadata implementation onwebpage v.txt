 1. Introduction
Internet information is characterized by the instability of its contents, decentralization of locations, multiplicity of forms, diversity of user groups, and dynamics of the environment. The amount of information on the internet continues its tremendous growth, and the size and number of sources appear to be growing at an exponential rate (Kobayashi &amp; Takeda, 2000). At least one study shows that users have become more diverse and that they spend more and more time on the internet (GVU  X  s 9th WWW User Survey: Web and Internet Use Summary, 2003). Findings indicate that 23% of webpages change daily, in the .com domain, more than 40% webpages change daily, and the half-life of the pages is about 10 days (in 10 days half of these pages have gone) (Arasu, Cho, Garcia-Molina, Paepcke, &amp; Raghavan, 2001). These features make the problems of web resource discovery and description more complex and sophisticated. It is apparent that it has been an increasingly complex challenge for internet searchers to find relevant information in the digital universe through the use of internet search engines. Not surprisingly, information science researchers as well as a growing group of information entrepreneurs have begun evaluating the performance of various search engines in terms of their success in assisting searchers with relevant information retrieval. Reviews of the literature about search engine performance and users  X  search behavior, however, focus on one viewpoint: that of the user. (Bilal &amp; Kirby, 2002; Leighton, 1997;
Lowley, 2000; Pu, Chuang, &amp; Yang, 2002; Schwartz, 1998; Yu &amp; Roh, 2002). This addresses the needs of only half of the internet user community. The internet has created an unparalleled opportunity for users to access knowledge products on a just-in-time and on-demand approach (H  X  am  X  al  X  ainen, Whinston, &amp; Vishik, 1996).

More and more people and organizations now publish on the internet. Web publishers are a growing population of internet users. Because most internet users employ search engines as a primary tool to tap internet resources (Haltley, 2002), every internet web publisher wants good webpage visibility in search engine results lists so as to increase accessibility of their webpages.
Web site visibility and accessibility are extremely important when web publishers are targeting the  X  X  X ypical X  X  internet user, i.e., one who usually does not know a web address before searching.
Unfortunately, many web sites have poor visibility in search engine rankings or may not be listed at all due to various reasons. Note, too, that it is a tremendous challenge for internet publishers to insure that their web sites appear at the top of a search engine return list, maximizing visibility.
It is widely recognized that many variables contribute to a successful and highly visible web site in a search engine results list. A search engine crawls a webpage on the internet, extracts keywords based on its content, and indexes it in its database before that webpage becomes available for a search query (Arasu et al., 2001). A well-designed, content-rich, and easily navigated site is very important. However, if a web site is not crawled and indexed by search engines or it is crawled and indexed but not well optimized, only a limited number of internet searchers will likely access it and all of the effort made with regard to webpage content would be wasted. In other words, simply posting a webpage on a public domain or submitting it to hundreds of search engines does not necessarily lead to a successful presence of that web site on internet search engine results lists.
Automatic indexing based on a webpage  X  s full-text has been widely used by internet search engines. However, automatic indexing techniques are most effective in a relatively small collection within a given domain. As the scope of their coverage expands, indexes succumb to problems of large retrieval sets and problems of cross disciplinary semantic drift (Weibel, 1995). It is obvious that automatic indexing techniques are not enough to handle internet information because the internet is huge, dynamic, and diverse. These features call for a simple, compatible, and convenient internet information description standard to assist and facilitate automatic indexing internet information effective and efficiently. Since creators of webpages are usually not experts in infor-mation retrieval, in fact many are content specialists with only the technical skills needed to transfer content to this medium, an information retrieval standard for improving accessibility should be designed for use by web designers and publishers with varying backgrounds. The introduction of metadata may become such a standard. Metadata attempts to facilitate understanding, identifying, describing, utilizing, and retrieving internet information sources and their contents.
Metadata is broadly defined as data about data. In principle, metadata provides an effective mechanism for describing and locating data that is relevant to a particular user (Burnett, Ng, &amp;
Park, 1999). The standard enhances cross-disciplinary discovery, offers a conceptual framework that supports the modular development of auxiliary metadata components, is used as a global standard for resource discovery, and defines a common ground of principles, procedures, core semantics, and a framework to support interoperable metadata (Weibel, 2000). Metadata devel-opment requires substantial cooperation and collaboration across different potential user groups.
Organization of metadata information in physical form is designed in a more flexible and structural electronic form; it fits for multiple logical organization of information; and it facilitates internet information identification and extraction (Smith, 1996). Metadata research has become a hot research topic, ranging from its application in digital libraries (Hill, Janee, Dolin, Frew, &amp;
Larsgaard, 1999), and digital museums (Zeng, 1999), to its impact on information retrieval (Cortez, 1999).

Including metadata in a webpage is not mandatory: it is voluntary and ad hoc in its imple-mentation. Internet publishers can select metadata elements and embed them directly in their webpages at will. Search engines use the metadata supplied in webpages to extract keywords and other related information for webpages and use them as index terms in their databases. Over the past several years, more and more web publishers have realized the importance of metadata and have added it to their webpages. According to one study, the number of web sites that contain one or more metadata tags approaches 70%, keyword metadata 17% and description metadata 15% (O  X  Neill, Lavoie, &amp; McClain, 2001). However, there is a big difference between creating metadata tags and optimizing your site for high ranking and visibility in search engine results lists. In other words, adding metadata to a webpage is one thing and getting a satisfactory ranking position is another.

It is not enough to simply add META tags and to submit your web site to search engine indexes and directories. The process of creating metadata can involve both subjective and objective input.
Some metadata is clearly objective: assertions of fact about authorship, date of creation, version, and other attributes that are generally able to be determined in an objective way. Other metadata may be subjective because such elements are subject to differing points of view (assignment of keywords, summarization of content in an abstract) (Duval, Hodgins, &amp; Sutton, 2002). Successful use of metadata to communicate meaning of information relies on users  X  understanding or awareness of other  X  s interpretation of the domain and how this interpretation is reflected in the metadata statement (Brasethvik, 1998). The findings (Sokvitne, 2003) demonstrate that there are misuses and inconsistencies in metadata element application in a webpage (title, creator/publisher, and subject). Furthermore, metadata users lack a clear picture of how metadata elements in a webpage behave with respect to visibility in search engine results lists. In other words, the effect of metadata application for improving information discovery cannot be maximized until people understand the domain clearly, interpret it in the context of metadata correctly, and comprehend the behavior of metadata elements fully.

Search engine optimization has become a very complex, sophisticated practice that requires constant research, practice, and reevaluation to be effective. A growing industry has blossomed that offers advice (for a fee in most cases) on maximizing webpage placement (for example, Search Engine
Advice ( http://www.searchengineadvice.com ), Search Engine Optimization Promotion Tools ( http:// www.bruceclay.com/web_rank.htm ), Want to drive more traffic to your web site? ( http:// www.1stsearchranking.com ), Search Engine Ranking ( http://www.aaxis.com ); Strategies for High Search Engine Rankings ( http://www.goldranking.com/search_engine_ranking_strategy.html ); and
Search Engine Positioning mid Optimization ; How easy are you to find? ( http://www.searchengine-position.com )). This advice about which techniques will provide optimal ranking results is hinted at on these organizations  X  web sites themselves but none of those offering advice describe the empirical research on which their recommendations should be based. While a common theme among these advice-givers is  X  X  X ocation, location, location X  X  the specific advice is fairly generic and based on conventional wisdom, How search engines rank Webpages ( http://www.searchenginewatch.com/ webmasters/rank.html ). Little research has been done on this topic (Schwartz, 1998). 1.1. Objectives
The objectives of this research were threefold: (1) to identify both internal and external factors of metadata elements within a webpage that impact ranking in search engine results lists, (2) to compare the impact of those design factors in a webpage on the webpage visibility in a search engine, and (3) to develop a practical metadata implementation strategy or approach to improve ranking of a webpage from an internet search engine. Notice that all factors specified in this study can be controlled and managed by webpage developers and designers. The significance of this research is that the findings will help web publishers increase traffic to their web sites by applying metadata element design features that will optimize ranking in search engine results lists. 1.2. Research question and hypotheses
This study examined various metadata design factors and their relationship to search engine results list placement. The primary research question was:  X  X  X ow can the ranking of a web site in a search engine  X  s results list be improved after metadata is implemented? X  X  That is, how can the visibility of a webpage in a search engine  X  s results list be optimized if metadata is embedded in a webpage? Visibility is defined as the ranking position in a search engine results list. The nearer to the top of a search results list, the better its visibility, and vice versa.

Based on the primary research question, five hypotheses were tested. They are: (1) Hypothesis 1(H1)
There is no difference in search result visibility performance between webpages with metadata element implementation and those without metadata element implementation. (2) Hypothesis 2(H2)
There is no difference in search result visibility performance among web pages with different numbers of metadata element combinations in a webpage. (3) Hypothesis 3(H3)
There is no difference in search result visibility performance among web pages with metadata title, webpages with metadata subject, and web pages with metadata description. (4) Hypothesis 4(H4)
There is no difference in search result visibility performance among web pages with different metadata element combinations of metadata title, metadata subject, and metadata description as well. (5) Hypothesis 5(H5)
Keywords in metadata extracted from webpage title, webpage full-text, or both make no dif-ference in search result visibility performance in a search engine results list.

At a broader level, if all webpages were classified into two distinct categories X  X  X ebpages with metadata and webpages without metadata X  X  X eb publishers would definitely ask which is better in terms of search result visibility performance. Hypothesis HI attempts to answer this question.
Hypotheses H2 X  X 5 address the impact of metadata elements on webpage visibility. These hypotheses try to answer how the metadata elements affect webpage visibility. H5 focuses on impact of keyword source of metadata elements on the webpage visibility while H2, H3, and H4 concentrate on impact of each individual metadata field (title, subject, or description), and their different combinations on search visibility. Hypotheses H2 and H4 look similar but in fact are subtly different. H2 treats metadata element combinations, in which the number of metadata combinations is the same, as the same group regardless of combination contents. H4, however, breaks them down into several groups and treats them differently in the statistical test. That is why H2 has only three different comparison groups while H4 has seven different comparison groups. H2 and H4 are complementary to each other. H5 addresses the external factors of metadata while
H2, H3, and H4 address internal factors of metadata. 2. Experimental design 2.1. Creation of test webpages and posting of these webpages 2.1.1. Webpage content characteristics analysis
In this study, we investigated internal and external factors that might impact webpage visibility in a search engine results. The internal factors refer to location and frequency of a keyword in a metadata element. In this case, the keyword which is used in a metadata element is selected and defined. That is, the selected keyword(s) reflect subject content of the webpages. The external factor refers to where the keyword(s) used in a metadata element comes from in a webpage. A keyword can be extracted from a webpage title, webpage full-text, or from outside the webpage. It emphasizes the source of the keyword. Toward this aim, the keyword location and its frequency in webpage title or webpage full-text, in conjunction with the keyword location and its frequency in a selected metadata element, are considered as the web content characteristics in testing webpage design.

Both the internal and external factors are categorized and listed as follows: (a) Metadata : As is conventionally understood, metadata can be defined literally as  X  X  X ata about data, X  X  but the term is normally understood to mean structured data about digital (and non-digital) resources that can be used to help support a wide range of operations. Observe that Title, Creator, Subject, Description, Publisher, Contributor, Date, Type, Format, Identifier, Source, Language, Relation, Coverage, and Rights are defined as basic metadata elements (in the Dublin
Metadata Set). Among them, Title, Subject, and Description were singled out for this experiment because the content of the three elements are directly related to the subject content of a webpage and keywords in these fields have the most potential to be crawled by search engines and further indexed as indexing terms in their databases. (b) Keyword duplication : We hypothesize that keyword frequency within a webpage or a metadata field would make a significant contribution to its visibility in a search engine results list.
Duplication of a keyword can happen in a title, a full-text, or a selected metadata element. In this study, the maximum keyword frequencies for title, full-text, metadata title field, metadata subject field, and metadata description field are set to 4, 5, 4, 4, and 4 respectively (see Table 1). (c) Combination of these factors : Various meaningful combinations of metadata title field, metadata subject field, and metadata description field were taken into consideration. This offered the opportunity to observe the impact of factor combinations on return result of a search engine.
The considered factor combinations are displayed in Table 2. (d) Keyword position : We believe that the position of a keyword within a webpage plays an important role in terms of its return results list in a search engine. Following this line, a keyword in a title and a keyword in full-text were treated separately.

In Tables 1 and 2, each row represents a designed webpage and each column represents one of the identified content characteristics. Tables 1 and 2 give an overview picture of the identified webpage content characteristics and test webpages. They should help readers understand how the experimental webpages were generated and to see how the characteristics are distributed among the test webpages. These tables would be very helpful in describing the data analysis. Each derived webpage is assigned a unique identification code that would be used in later tables and data analysis (see left column of each table). The  X  X  X ppearance status X  X  column in both tables refers to whether or not the test webpage was retrieved using one of the search engines. 2.1.2. Creation of testing webpages
The original webpage was modified based on content characteristics and more than 40 test webpages were derived for the study. Each derived webpage represents one of the webpage content characteristics in Tables 1 or 2. The content of the original webpage was slightly revised and modified when some derived webpages were generated. These changes included discarding or adding some keywords to title, full-text, or other defined metadata fields, changing term forms, and inserting the investigator names into each of the test webpages.

After subject analysis, the keyword  X  X  X cupuncture X  X  was identified as the indexing term for the derived webpages.

Each derived webpage was given a special HTML file name from which the investigators could easily trace its content characteristics during observation and data collection. It also facilitated later data analysis.
 Table 1 shows the distribution of the primary keyword  X  X  X cupuncture X  X  in the derived webpages.
The number in the sub-columns represents the frequency of  X  X  X cupuncture X  X  in the webpages. For instance,  X  X  X cupuncture X  X  appears one time, two times, three times, four times, and five times in a test page  X  s full-text (see Table 1). The combination impact of different webpage content charac-teristics is illustrated in Table 2.

The derived webpages were posted in an internet public domain so that search engines and users would have free access to them. We then identified search engines with webpage http submission features. All search engines that charged a fee for submission were eliminated from the identified search engine list. Finally, the web addresses of the derived testing webpages were submitted to each of the free submission search engines.
 Based on the content of the original webpage, search strategies for the study were formulated. The search queries were used to search all the submitted search engines on a weekly basis.
Webpage file name, position in a results list, search engine name and other related information were recorded if a webpage was hit in a search engine. The experiment ended after 21 weeks of data observation. 3. Data analysis
In this study, a total of 46 webpages were posted and submitted to 19 search engines. The test webpages ultimately showed up in eight search engines. The reasons for non-appearance in some of the search engines varied. Some search engines merged with others, some were no longer available after test webpage submission, some of the search engine servers did not work properly, and some simply never indexed the submitted test webpages. Among the 46 webpages, only 28 webpages finally appeared in results lists of one or more search engine. The remaining 18 web-pages never presented in any search engine results list. The number of test webpages that appeared varied in different search engines, ranging from 5 to 11. See Fig. 1 for the average webpage presentation numbers for the search engines. In Fig. 1 the X -axis is defined as the average number of retrieved test webpages in a search engine and Y -axis is search engine. 3.1. Test webpage appearance analysis After checking to see which test webpages were retrieved (identified in the far right columns of
Tables 1 and 2, where a bullet in the column means the corresponding test webpage appeared in at least one of the search engine results), we found 18 webpages never showed up in the experimental study.
 In Table 1, W_P_10, W_P_11, W_P_12, W_P_13, W_P_14, W_P_15, W_P_16, W_P_17,
W_P_18, W_P_19, and W_P_21 did not appear in any search engine  X  s results list. W_P_20, which falls within the  X  X  X etadata description field X  X  category, appeared just once in the Google search engine. It is interesting that all non-retrieved test webpages were distributed in the categories  X  X  X etadata title field X  X ,  X  X  X etadata subject field X  X , and  X  X  X etadata description field X  X  and, impor-tantly, that the keywords used in the metadata elements did not come from either title or full-text of the test webpages. This suggests that if a keyword which does not appear in the title and full-text of a webpage, is used as a keyword in metadata fields (subject, title, and description), the possibility for it being crawled, indexed, and included by a search engine is very slim. Note that there is an exception: one test webpage (W_P_20) meeting these conditions did appear in the return list of a search engine but the frequency (only one time) is very very low compared to other presented webpages.
 The situation in Table 2 is more complicated. Pages W_P_25, W_P_29, W_P_30, W_P_31,
W_P_39, W_P_41, and W_P_45 were never retrieved. Notice that several of them followed the same pattern identified in Table 1: These webpages (W_P_29, W_P_30, W_P_31, and W_P_41) were not in either the title or full-text categories but in the metadata fields (metadata title field, metadata subject field, and metadata description field) were simply excluded from any search result. This further corroborates and confirms the previous conclusion that keywords only in metadata fields result in low likelihood of retrieval. The last three un-retrieved test webpages (two titles and one full-text) do not fit this pattern. They were expected to show up but they did not present in any search engine.
In Fig. 2, the appearance rates of valid posted webpages for the eight search engines are listed, where the X -axis is the appearance rate and Y -axis is search engine. The appearance rate is defined as the ratio of the total number of retrieved unique posted webpages in a search engine during the experimental study to the number of all valid unique posted webpages. The valid posted webpages refer to all defined webpages in Tables 1 and 2. The appearance rate can be used to measure indexing coverage of a search engine. A high appearance rate means a better indexing coverage for a search engine. Search engines Google and Alta Vista achieved the best and worst performance in terms of search engine database indexing coverage, respectively.

Note that the appearance rates for all search engines are relatively low. This can be explained by the fact that many posted webpages employed the keywords that did not appear in both title and full-text as their metadata keywords while these webpages were not expected to show up in any search engine results list. The design and inclusion of these webpages was for confirming this claim.

Table 3 shows the distribution of test webpage appearances in the search engines. This table will give readers a better picture of how the posted webpages appeared in the search engines. It is clear that no search engine included all posted test webpages.

Fig. 3 shows the frequency distribution of all posted test webpages across the eight search engines. In Fig. 3 the X -axis is the number of search engines where the same webpages showed up and the Y -axis is the corresponding webpage frequency. SE stands for search engine. For instance, the frequency of different posted webpages that showed up in none of the eight search engines is 18 while the frequency of different posted webpages that appeared in all eight search engines is three. 3.2. Examination of hypotheses
In order to examine and test the proposed hypotheses, three statistical techniques were used: one-way ANOVA , two-way ANOVA , and independent-sample T-test . For the one-way ANOVA and the two-way ANOVA , we are assuming that the involved dependent variable is normally distributed, the population variances of the dependent variable are the same for all cells, and the case represents random samples and the values of dependent variable are independent of each other. For the T-test , the assumptions are that the variable is normally distributed in the popu-lation, the variances of the normally distributed test variable are equal, and the case represents random samples and the values of dependent variable are independent of each other.

The measurement for the study was defined as the position of a retrieved webpage in a search engine. That is, the position of a webpage in a search engine results list was used to measure performance of the test webpages. It is clear that the definition of the measurement is measurable and manageable. The retrieved webpages located in the top of the results list of a search engine have good visibility. In other words, the higher the position of a retrieved webpage in a search engine results list, the better its performance and vice versa. A higher position of a retrieved webpage corresponds to lower value of the variable position and a lower position corresponds to a higher value of the variable position.
 or the sig. is smaller than 0.05, the finding is statistically significant and null hypotheses are re-jected. 3.2.1. Examination of hypothesis 1 (H1)
H1 states that there is no difference in search return performance between webpages with metadata elements and those without metadata elements.
 The test webpages were simply divided into two groups with metadata and without metadata.
For the first group metadata was added in the metadata data title, metadata subject, or metadata description fields. For the second group keywords with different frequencies appear in title, or full-text, or both. The independent variables were the webpages with metadata elements and those without metadata elements. The dependent variable was the webpage return position in a search engine results list. A T-test was used for this test because of the involvement of only two variables.
Tables 4 and 5 show the statistical results for the T-test . The variable POSITION is defined the same as the returned webpage position in a search engine. TYPEs 1 and 2 refer to the webpages without metadata elements and those with metadata elements, respectively.
 are significantly different so the assumption of equal variances is violated. The null hypothesis was rejected. The means for the webpages with metadata element and those without metadata element are 6.1037 and 6.9288 respectively (See Table 4). This shows that the webpages with metadata elements achieved better visibility performance than those without metadata elements. The findings confirm the claim that implementation of metadata in a webpage would improve its visibility in a search engine result. Fig. 4 displays the results visually.
 3.2.2. Examination of hypothesis 2 (H2)
H2 states that there is no difference in search return performance among the webpages with different numbers of metadata element combinations. In other words, it tests whether the number of metadata element combination effects webpage return performance.

The independent variables were webpages with different numbers of metadata element com-binations. The variable TYPE in the following tables stands for the combinations. Its valid values are 1 (including metadata title, metadata subject, and metadata description), 2 (including meta-data title and metadata subject, metadata title and metadata description, and metadata subject and metadata description), and 3 (including metadata title and metadata subject and metadata description). The dependent variable was the webpage return position in a search engine result. Due to the multiple independent variables, a one-way ANOVA was used for this hypothesis.
Tables 6 and 7 show the results for this test. Because the overall F is statistically significant as shown in Table 7 ( F  X  5 : 795, p  X  0 : 003 (&lt;0.05)), a post hoc test (the Tukey method) designed for situations in which the variances are unequal was conducted. The results of the Tukey HSD test are presented in Tables 8 and 9. It is very clear that the mean differences for the group 3 (com-bination is 3) against group 2 (combination is 2) and group 1 (combination is 1) are and ) 1.8236 ( ), respectively (see Table 8) (Note  X  X   X  X  indicates significant difference in the table).
Both are significant and negative, which indicates that the webpages with keywords appearing in the metadata title field, metadata subject field and metadata description field achieved better visibility performance than other possible combinations.

In Table 6, the standard deviation of group 2 is relatively large (6.42062) and the difference between its lower bound and upper bound is also large (5.9490 X 10.0022). It shows that the per-formance of group 2 (including metadata title and metadata subject, metadata title and metadata description, and metadata subject and metadata description) is not stable. Multiple combinations and their inconsistent performance in this group may account for this phenomenon. Contrary to expectations, group 2 did not achieve better performance than group 1.

Table 9 shows that groups 2 and 1 and groups 3 and 1 form two homogeneous subsets whose means are not significantly different from one another. Fig. 5 is the visual display of the distri-bution of dependent variable across the groups.
 3.2.3. Examination of hypothesis 3 (H3)
H3 states that there is no difference in search return performance among the webpages with metadata title, webpages with metadata subject, and webpages with metadata description.
The independent variables were webpages with metadata title, webpages with metadata subject, and webpages with metadata description in a webpage. The dependent variable was the webpage return position in a search engine result. Due to the multiple independent variables, a one-way ANOVA was used for this hypothesis.

Tables 10 and 11 demonstrate the results of the ANOVA test analysis. TYPEs 1, 2, and 3 in these tables stand for webpages with metadata title, webpages with metadata subject, and web-pages with metadata description, respectively. Since the overall F is significant as shown in Table 11 ( F  X  14 : 604, p  X  0 : 000 (&lt;0.05)), the null hypothesis was rejected. Therefore a follow-up test ( Tukey method) was conducted to determine the reasons for the rejection. The Tukey HSD analysis results are presented in Tables 12 and 13. From Table 12 group 2 (metadata subject) against the group 1 (metadata title) (  X  I J  X  X  3 : 5222  X  X  ) and against the group 3 (metadata descriptor) (  X  I J  X  X  7 : 3906  X  X  ) achieved better performance than both the groups 1 and 3.
That is, webpages with metadata subject achieved better performance than either webpages with metadata title or webpages with metadata description. The analysis shows that the metadata subject field is the most important and effective metadata element in terms of improving webpage visibility in a search engine results list. Notice that the mean difference for metadata title against metadata description is negative but not significant ( ) 3.8684), indicating that metadata title field still achieved better performance (but not statistically significant) than metadata description.
After a close look at Table 10, it is apparent that performance of web pages with metadata subject field is not only the best among the groups but also the most stable across all search engines (std deviation  X  4.31541, lower bound  X  3.5314, and upper bound  X  5.6873) and that performance of webpages with metadata description field is not only the worst but also the most unstable (std deviation  X  5.54977, lower bound  X  8.2716, and upper bound  X  l5.7284).
These findings suggest that webpages with metadata subject and metadata description have strong and weak impacts, respectively, on their visibility in a search engine result.
As is shown in Table 13, no more than one group forms a homogeneous subset in this test. Fig. 6 is the visual display of the distribution of the dependent variables across the designed groups. 3.2.4. Examination of the hypothesis 4 (H4)
H4 states that there is no difference in search return performance among the webpages with different metadata element combinations of metadata title, metadata subject, and metadata description.

H4 is complementary to H2. The independent variables were webpages with different metadata element combinations of metadata title, metadata subject, and metadata description. The dependent variable was the webpage return position in a search engine result. Due to the multiple independent variables, a one-way ANOVA was used for this hypothesis.

In this case, the variable TYPE stands for the metadata element combination: metadata title (TYPE  X  1), metadata subject (TYPE  X  2), metadata description (TYPE  X  3), metadata title and subject (TYPE  X  4), metadata title and description (TYPE  X  5), metadata subject and description (TYPE  X  6), and metadata title and subject and description (TYPE  X  7).
 Tables 14 and 15 display the results of the ANOVA test analysis. It is apparent that the overall
F ( F  X  9 : 237, p  X  0 : 000 (&lt;0.05)) is significant (see Table 15), therefore the null hypothesis is rejected. A Tukey HSD method was carried out to determine the reasons for rejection. The generated Tukey HSD analysis results are presented in Tables 16 and 17. The group 7 (metadata title and subject and descriptor) has four significant and negative mean differences and two negative mean differences against the other groups; Group 2 (metadata subject) has three sig-nificant and negative mean differences and one negative mean difference against the other groups;
Group 5 (metadata title and descriptor) has one significant and negative mean difference and four negative mean differences against the other groups; and Group 6 (metadata subject and descriptor) has one significant and negative mean difference and two negative mean differences against the other groups. In other words, webpages with keywords in metadata title and subject and description achieved the best performance across the groups; followed by webpages with keywords in metadata subject; then webpages with keywords in metadata title and description; and last, webpages with keywords in metadata subject and description.

From Table 14, groups 2 (std deviation  X  4.31541, lower bound  X  3.5314, and upper bound  X  5.6873) and 5 (std deviation  X  1.95180, lower bound  X  2.0520, and upper bound  X  5.6623) achieved the most stable performance in this test. On the other hand, groups 4 (std deviation  X  6.78970, lower bound  X  6.9094, and upper bound  X  l3.0906) and 6 (std devia-tion  X  5.80604, lower bound  X  4.8845, and upper bound  X  8.3329) achieved the most unstable performance in this test.

Table 17 demonstrates that there are three homogeneous subsets: group (7, 5, 2, 6, and 1), group (6, 1, and 4), and group (1, 4, and 3). Fig. 7 is the visual display of the distribution of dependent variable across the groups. 3.2.5. Examination of hypothesis 5 (H5)
H5 states that keywords in metadata fields extracted from a title, a full-text, or both make no difference with respect to search return performance in a search engine result. With this hypothesis we attempted to understand the impact of keywords in a webpage used in metadata fields on the visibility in a search result.

The independent variables were keywords in metadata extracted from the title, keywords in metadata extracted from the full-text, and keywords in metadata extracted from both title and full-text. The dependent variable was the webpage return position in a search engine result. Be-cause of the multiple independent variables, a one-way ANOVA was used for this hypothesis.
In Table 18 the values in the column TYPEs 1, 2, and 3 represent keywords in the metadata field extracted from title, keywords in the metadata field extracted from full-text, and keywords in the metadata field extracted from both title and full-text, respectively. Because of the significant full-text, or both made significant differences in search return performance in a search engine results list. Thus a follow-up test was conducted to identify the reasons for the difference. In Table 20, the mean difference ( I J ) for group 1 (keywords extracted from title) against group 2 (keywords extracted from full-text) is ) 9.5666 ( ) (negative and significant). The mean difference ( I J ) for group 1 against group 3 (keywords extracted from both title and full-text) is (negative). The mean difference ( I J ) for group 3 against group 2 is significant). This shows that keywords in metadata fields extracted from a title and keywords in metadata fields extracted from both title and full-text achieved better performance than keywords in metadata field extracted from only the full-text. In order to effectively improve webpage visi-bility in search engine results lists, keywords of metadata elements should come from title, or from both title and full-text.

Note that in Table 18 groups 3 (std deviation  X  3.42017, lower bound  X  2.9324, and upper bound  X  4.1483) and 2 (std deviation  X  4.68505, lower bound  X  11.6101, and upper bound  X  14.1677) achieved the steadiest performance and the most unstable performance across all search engines, respectively.

Table 21 shows that there is only one homogeneous subset (Groups 1 and 3). Fig. 8 is the visual display of the distribution of dependent variable across the groups. 4. Conclusion
This research identified influential factors of metadata implementation that impact search engine optimization, analyzed their impacts on major internet search engines, and then recom-mended applicable and practical methods for improving search engine optimization in light of metadata implementation.

Toward these aims, 46 webpages were derived and modified from a selected original webpage, and were posted on the internet. The URLs of these processed webpages were submitted to 19 search engines. The investigators used a simple formulated query to search the 19 search engines weekly. The returned results from each of the search engines were monitored and recorded. After 21 weeks of observation, eight search engines responded to the submissions positively and 28 posted webpages appeared in our observation results lists at least once. All collected data were tabulated and classified. Three different statistical techniques were employed to examine the five hypotheses. Although all five hypotheses were rejected, the findings nevertheless suggest several options to optimize webpage visibility. Based on the statistical analysis discussed in the previous section, some key findings and recommendations for optimizing web site placement in results lists are summarized below: (1) Do not use keywords in metadata fields that do not appear in either title or full-text of a web-(2) With respect to search engine indexing coverage, Google (47.83%), EntireWeb (36.96%), All-(3) Webpages with metadata elements achieved better visibility performance than those without (4) Webpages with keywords appearing in three metadata fields (title field, subject field, and (5) Webpages with metadata subject achieve better the visibility performance than either the web-(6) Webpages with keywords in metadata title and subject and description achieved the best per-(7) Keywords in the metadata elements extracted from title, and keywords in metadata elements In general, if a webpage is posted somewhere, it will most likely be indexed and included in
Google. Metadata is a good mechanism to improve the visibility of a posted webpage in search engine results lists. The metadata subject field plays a more important role than any other metadata field. Keyword sources for metadata are also important. Make sure that these keywords are extracted from the webpage itself. If the selected keywords for metadata are not reflected in either title or full-text of a webpage, your efforts may be in vain. To maximize the effects, these keywords should come from both title and full-text.

The findings of this research should benefit web publishers, search engine designers and web information seekers. Future research directions might include, but are not limited to the fol-lowing. An investigation of the impact of keyword frequency in metadata fields on the visibility of the webpage.
