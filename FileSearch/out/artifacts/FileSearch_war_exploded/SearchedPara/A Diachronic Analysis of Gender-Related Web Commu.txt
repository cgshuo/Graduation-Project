 In the present era, a wide variety of organizations and individuals have become to transmit information through the Internet. With many new Web sites constructed every day, Web content has become more diverse and the Web X  X  structure ever more complex. The staggering volume of information on the Web makes it difficult to find truly useful information. Therefore, Web mining is one of the most important research issues in modern information technology. 
In general, there are three categories of Web mining: Web contents mining, Web usage mining and Web structure mining. Automatic discovery of content patters in Web documents, mining of Web access logs, and Web community extraction based on Web link structure analysis are typical research topics for these three Web mining taking gender-related community as an interesting application domain. 
As its name indicates, the Web X  X  structure is a product of  X  X onlinearly tangled links that are provided like a cobweb betw een sites. X  Information on the links be-tween sites is written into Web pages as a string of characters through HTML, the standard Web language. When these recognizable characters are analyzed, the rela-tionships between Web sites become visible. Therefore, analysis of the linkage struc-ture makes it possible to discover the internally fabricated  X  X eb community. X  In this paper, we refer to a Web community as a collection of Web pages created by indi-viduals and/or organizations with a common interest on a specific topic . To find Web communities, some link analysis techniques consider the Web as a graph, with Web pages as nodes and hyperlinks as edges, and automatically identify such Web com-munities by extracting distinctive graph structures [1, 2, 3]. 
Among many graph-based Web community extraction algorithms, HITS-based mining algorithms seem promising, where HITS represents Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search. They are based on the notion of proposed authorities and hubs, where an authority is a page with good contents on a topic that is pointed to by many good hub pages, and vice versa. HITS is an algorithm that extracts authorities and hubs from a use a HITS-based Web structure mining tool named Companion-[3] which is based on a related page algorithm named Companion [2]. Companion-is capable of dia-chronic analysis as well as synchronic analysis of Web communities. This capability is essential when applying a mining tool to investigate a Web community X  X ike the gender-related community X  X hat changes shape dramatically over time due to socio-cultural and political changes. 
In the real world, gender awareness has been growing rapidly in recent years due to the developing movements toward gender mainstreaming in many countries [4]. Gen-der-related Web sites follow this trend: their number is increasing rapidly and the structure of their linkage is changing diachronically. In this paper, we argue that by analyzing gender-related communities constr ucted on the Web, it is possible to cap-ture precisely how society and people X  X  co nsciousness regarding gender mainstream-ing have been changing over time. We used Companion-to analyze five consecutive years of Web archives collected at the Kitsuregawa Laboratory of Institute of Indus-trial Science, University of Tokyo, up to February, 2003. 
The results of the analysis of the Web archive demonstrate how the concept of gen-der and the gender-related community have been transformed diachronically: We first observe how changes in the real world, i.e. the world made up of individuals and organizations, can be reflected on the Web as changes in a Web community. Second, we analyze the gender-related Web community to discover a new trend or movement that is hard to identify without using a mining tool with diachronic analysis capability. Last, we investigate a case that calls for the deciphering capability of miners. That is, when miners first look at some phenomena recognized in the Web community, they may find them difficult to interpret. However, after careful examination, something new is discovered in the real world. 
The authors have little knowledge of related works; the closest related articles con-cern the digital divide or studies on the gender gap in computer and Internet use. 2.1 Web Archives In order to extract and analyze a Web community, it is necessary to collect the rele-vant Web pages by a search robot. As our analysis source, we adopted Japanese Web archives (in jp-domain), collected annually at the Kitsuregawa Laboratory of Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, for the years 1999-2003. These particular years have meaning for the analysis of gender-related Web communities in Japan because the Basic Law for a Gender-equality Society was approved in 1999. Table 1 summarizes the statistical figures of these Web archives. The total number of Web pages includes the number of Web pages linked to the jp-domain. The seed pages total number of these seed pages. Acknowledging the possibility of a seed page being artificially induced in terms of the users X  extracting community, we defined a seed page as a Web page in which more than three in-links are connected. The total num-ber of communities explains all the communities identified based on the seed pages. 2.2 Companion-: A HITS-Based Web Mining Tool The mining tool we utilized for discovering and examining Web communities is Companion-[3]. Companion-is a HITS-based Web mining tool based on Companion [2], and its features are twofold:  X  X eb Community Browser X  makes synchronic analysis possible while  X  X ommunity Evolution Viewer X  makes diachronic analysis community [5]. As mentioned earlier, diachronic analysis capability is essential, par-ticularly when a mining tool is applied to investigate a Web community X  X ike the gender-related community X  X hat changes shape dramatically over time. This is the reason why we adopted Companion-to perform our research. 
Fig. 1 depicts the gender-related Web community at February 2003 created by  X  X eb Community Browser, X  where the key word  X  X ender X  (in Japanese) is specified in the left-hand window of the screen, 21 gender-related communities are shown in the middle of the screen, and the community ID and its name and other useful infor-mation are given in the right-hand window of the screen. 
The Viewer can display both modes of  X  X ain History X  and  X  X etailed History. X  By effectively using these separate displays, we are able to examine the community more thoroughly. Fig. 2 depicts part of the development process of gender-related Web communities in five years, tracing back from the Web archive of February 2003, which was created by  X  X ommunity Evolution Viewer X  in Main History mode. On the the five pillars is divided into left-hand and right-hand sub-pillars so that sites moved to other communities, sites newly appearing, sites moved from other communities, and sites disappearing at the next observation are identified in addition to the sites that have continued, and those for which there is no change. 
Because Companion-is a HITS-based mining tool, the presence of an authority which is linked to by many Web sites as well as hubs with large numbers of Web links plays a crucial role when extracting the Web community. Web communities are identified as a collective en tity gathered around common interests by the grouping of seed pages. These extracted communities are then given  X  X eadline tags X  according to the frequency in emergence of key words derived from anchor texts responding to the URLs of the Web pages. The following sections show concrete examples of commu-nities and their identifications. 3.1 Purpose of Analysis For the purpose of elucidating how the concept of gender has been transforming, the following two approaches are necessary for the analysis of gender-related Web com-munities: (1) A synchronic analysis: in other words, a snapshot approach that captures the mu-(2) A diachronic analysis: in other words, an approach examining how a Web com-
In this investigation, we employ approach (2) because the time-sensitive nature of gender studies in Japan is the focus of the analysis. (Our preliminary research em-ploying approach (1) has already been reported [6].) 
In addition, in analyzing Web communities, we need to pay special attention to the relationship between communities in the real world where individuals or organiza-tions are actors/subjects and the constructed communities on the Web, which consti-tute the accumulated information originally se nt from these actors/subjects in the real world. Therefore, it is inevitable to consider the questions as follows: (a) Reflection of real-world communities in the Web: Can we observe a reflection of (b) Discovery by Web community mining: What does the analysis of Web communi-(c) The way of deciphering: Are some phenomena recognized in a Web community 3.2 Reflection of the Real-World Communities in the Web We examine question (a) by applying it to the recognizable case of gender-related communities in the real world. For example, we observed how the Web community has been responding to the real world by particularly focusing on the  X  X omen X  X  cen-ter X  community (a group keyword of woman, center, male and female, and participa-tion was given as the headline tag: identification 35392 as of February 2003) consid-ering the relationship between the terminology of gender and the development of the gender community. Fig. 3 shows the development process of women X  X  centers in five years, tracing back from the Web archive of February 2003, and the collective shape of the related Web pages, which can be extracted by inserting the keyword  X  X ender X  in Japanese to the Viewer. The development process of community is identifiable when we trace back through time (beginning from February 2003) by counting the number of URLs. The line thickness shows how many communities have been moved. Twenty-one communities emerged as of February 2003 when the key-word was  X  X ender. X  The communities in which the term  X  X ender X  appears frequently are placed in the upper part of the display window. The development of this Web community perfectly corresponds to the reality in Japan, where women X  X  centers have sprung up everywhere from the municipal to the prefecture level, inspired by their mutual experience to build a coalition among them-selves. In each municipal entity, spaces/bases for women had started to be established approximately ten years ago; however, due to the approval of the Basic Law for a Gender-equality Society in June 1999, the incorporation of sections for gender policy enforcement into  X  X omen X  X  centers X  as working-level sections was accelerated. Many centers changed their names to  X  X omen X  X  center, X  and they opened their own Web sites in order to express their strong support for gender equality. 
According to the list of the  X  X elated fac ilities for gender equality X  to check whether these places have their own Web sites, we perceived that the display of URLs was (women X  X  centers). X  Also, nicknames in hiragana or katakana were given to the cen-ters to express their uniqueness. The nicknames and the names of regions can be found in the collective figure of key words. We also observed a tendency of unifica-tion in the term that describes  X  X omen X , changing from  X  X ujin X  to  X  X yosei X , though  X  X ujin X  did appear once in 2000. Although some people complained about the discom-fort among men using facilities that have  X  X omen X  in their names, most people agreed to use the name of  X  X omen X  X  center X  since gender equality in society has not been fully realized. 
As of the year 2000, prefecture-funded women X  X  centers were under construction in ten prefectures, and only seventeen prefectures (out of a total of 47 prefectures in Japan) did not have women X  X  centers [7]. The women X  X  centers have begun to rename themselves as  X  X anjo kyodosankaku (gender-equality) centers. X  Some researchers are concerned about this tendency because this name change is coupled with negative realities such as budget cuts for the centers and for women X  X  education; taken to-gether, the term  X  X anjo X  (men and women) in the name may imply that the  X  X rogram for the promotion of women X  X  status X  has lost its legitimacy [8]. As we have ex-plained, the Viewer that connects communi ties through common URLs demonstrates a significant ability to recognize changes to Web site titles. 
The  X  X omen X  X  center X  community records the lowest rank out of 21 communities extracted by the keyword  X  X ender. X  This is because the term  X  X ender X  did not fre-contained in the anchor links. Although the  X  X asic Law for a Gender-equality Soci-ety X  envisioned the institutionalization of the concept of  X  X ender, X  this newly im-discussing the law, the fundamental principle of  X  X eing free from the bounds of gen-der X  was rewritten and replaced by the ph rase,  X  X egardless of sex difference X ; the rephrasing of the basic philosophy of the law effectively stabilized the dualism of case of public organizations among the gender-related communities. 3.3 Discovery by Web Community Mining We also examined question (b). We have explained before that  X  X ain History, X  the fundamental constituent of the  X  X ommunity Evolution Viewer, X  represents horizon-community Web site constituents are increasing yearly, but the scales of some com-munities have quantitatively diminished according to the examination done in Febru-ary 2003. Two sexual harassment communities, for instance, show this horizontal change. Fig. 4 depicts the phenomenon perceived by the research. The way of developing the community in the past coincides with that of other communities at four observation times. That means although it appears as if the number of the Web sites has de-creased, the community has merely divided based on its contents. In the past, the contents were not very specialized/differentiated, so that the community was con-ceived of as one community. 
The  X  X etailed History X  mode, which clearly shows the transfer of Web sites, can provide a picture of how the community was divided; as of February 2003, the com-munity recognized as one before was differentiated into two communities: on the one hand, the community of campus sexual harassment sites and similar organizations X  sites and on the other, personal Web sites that show an interest in the issue of sexual harassment. It might be difficult to explain the reason why some Web sites are catego-the university organizations. 
From a different point of view, it may also be explained that these Web sites be-came more focused and specialized in terms of themes and topics. Analyzing the web communities exposes the  X  X eality X  of the division within the real-world community. duced by Companion-should be evaluated as a legitimate methodological  X  X iscov-ery X  in the process of developing Web mining tools. 3.4 The Way of Deciphering Finally, we examined question (c). The headline tags attached to the groups of the connected communities vary when observed through the community evolution viewer. For example, Fig. 5 demonstrates that the groups of a community have differ-ent tags in the developmental process. When we scrutinize the process more carefully, changes in the word order or the contents of the tags can be also recognized. Further-more, it should be critically questioned that in spite of looking into the more detailed list regarding the keywords appearing on the headline tags horizontally shown as history, we are not able to find the keyword  X  X ender. X  Why does this happen? Is this a matter that needs to be discussed? 
This may be possible to be interpreted as an inevitable result caused by the particu-lar feature of the viewer: an examination system that considers the number of the common URLs as a primal resource and focuses on the commonality of the communi-ties in history. Instead, we argue that the unique feature of the viewer provides a new possibility for analyzing the Web communities. Fig. 5 shows the transformation of the Science Fiction (SF) fans X  community, starting from the archive of the year 2003. A keyword of  X  X ender X  emerges in the archive as of February 2003. The immediate  X  X ender SF Research Group, X  which seeks for the availability of  X  X ree thinking that is not confined to the conventional binary system of sex/gender X  joining the SF commu-nity. As the fact of the  X  X ender SF Research Group X  proves, new members can bring different implications to the Web communities. Therefore, it is a significant contribu-tion to be able to conceive the preferen ce of the community, to read how the commu-nity has changed, and to predict the next new realm of a community X  X  interest. More-cious resource because it makes them re-acknowledge the social, cultural, and politi-cal environment in which the keyword of  X  X ender X  emerged. 3.5 Validity of Mining Results by Companion-Companion-is a modified version of Companion [2], and provides better precision than HITS [1] and Companion. Note that all three, i.e. HITS, Companion and Com-panion-, are based on related page algorithms. Although they provide synchronic analysis capability, only Companion-provides diachronic analysis capability, i.e. the ability to extract the evolution of Web communities from a temporal series of Web archives. Therefore the results obtained by using the Viewer are not obtained by HITS and Companion unless they provide an interface for diachronic analysis. 
The validity of the mining results obtained by Companion-may change depending on the concept of community that we conceive. We examined 21 gender-related Web communities created by  X  X eb Community Browser X  using the archive of the year 2003 carefully, and found that most member-pairs in a community do not have sig-ture of a HITS-based mining algorithm. In other words, a Web community induced by a HITS-based mining tool is meaningful when one intends to group a set of Web pages together as a community, where each member is equally important as an  X  X u-thority X  on a specific topic. 
There are people who want to link (or even back-link) their Web pages together to promote fellow feeling. For such people, using HITS to enumerate all members of a Web community may be problematic because the Web communities that one is inter-ested in may be overshadowed by a more dominant Web community. To resolve this problem a Web community identification algorithm was introduced based on a maxi-mum flow framework [10]. It defines a community to be a set of Web pages that link (in either direction) to more Web pages in the community than to pages outside of the community. Therefore a maximum flow Web mining tool may be more profitable if we want to identify Web communities that ar e more tightly coupled to each other than to non-members. this research. For this purpose our HITS-based experiment seems to be promising because each Web site of a community should be equally authorized on the same topic. By analyzing the Web communities constructed around the keyword  X  X ender X  on the Web, we have attempted to gain new conceptions of societal gender phenomena, available for observation only on the Web. 
Using Companion-as a Web mining tool, the research examines the development of gender-related communities extracted through the search term  X  X ender. X  This method enabled us to examine the gender communities subjectively as well as objec-developmental process of the Web communities was examined thoroughly by gender specialists, the present analysis provided a positive example in terms of the meaning-displays, which seem nonsense at first glance, become a vital and challenging space to be deciphered (=analyzed) through the eyes of specialists of a particular field. 
The research concretely demonstrates the effectiveness and impact of collaborating with researchers of specific fields who are familiar with the reality of the contents in facilitating the development of appropriate Web mining tools. This kind of dialog with researchers can only make the analysis tool more sophisticated. If the functions interesting types of results from their analyses. Simultaneously, we have cautioned considered, the examination research may be flawed. Reflection upon the  X  X nalysis tool X  itself is always necessary for such examinations. The authors are thankful to Professors Masaru Kitsuregawa and Masashi Toyoda of help in this research. This research was partly supported by a Grants-in-Aid for Sci-entific Research of MEXT of Japan in the Category of Scientific Research (B) (2) (Grant number 15300031) on  X  X onstruction of a Portal Site for Gender Studies using a Diachronic Analysis Method of Web Communities X  (2003-2006).
