 Document summarization has been widely explored for a long time, which has shown such as snippet creation for search engine , contextual advertising [1] [2], etc. 
A variety of summarization methods have been developed, which can be roughly divided into two classes: extractive approach and abstractive approach [3]. An extract summary, the content from the document may be paraphrased, compressed or approaches have been proposed by making use of the local information in a document are adopted [5-16]. 
Recently, based on the assumption that similar documents can provide more useful clues to help summarize a specified document, document expansion methods have been proposed to build an appropriate document context for summarization [17][18]. document context while ignore social contextual information (i.e. the combination of document context and user context) when summarizing a single document in an online social environment. SocialContextSum to make use of social contextual information in the summarization are employed to rank sentences respectively. Finally, a few most important sentences document-context based score and user-context based score. 
Experiments have been performed on a social tagging dataset, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach leveraging social contextual information outperforms several baseline methods. comparing with other baselines. Section 4 concludes the paper with future work. document context and user context for a specified document from online documents. number of sentences with highest overall scores into the summary. 2.1 Social Context Recognition context and user context into the collaborative summarization process. D (u) , and tag vector D (x can be modeled with all the documents that have been tagged by the user and all the Based on this representation, we can measure the similarity between any two documents (users) by their corresponding vectors. adopted in this study. Since the latent numbers of document clusters and user clusters are hard to predict in advance, in this study we simply set them to the square root of the total number of documents and users respectively. includes the users with similar information preference and different user cluster shows documents x and y, if the number of users who tags document x is greater than that of users who tags document y, we may assume that the user cluster is more interested in tagged by most of the users in each user cluster as the user context for each cluster. 2.2 Sentence Ranking Based on Social Context recognized, all the documents in the document context which the specified document context and user context respectively. 2.2.1 Sentence Ranking Based on Document Context To rank sentences based on its document context, a graph-based ranking algorithm is M G j M by making the sum of each row equal to 1. 
The ranking score of sentence s i based on document context can be denoted 
Score s , which is calculated by the following formula: to 0.4 in the study. document relationship, which can be computed respectively as follows. where n is the number of sentences in the document context of the specified document 0.85. The convergence of the above iteration computing process is achieved when the 0.0001. 2.2.2 Sentence Ranking Based on User Context To rank sentences by considering all the us er context X  X  influences, each user context adopted to rank sentences based on each user context UC k by naturally making use of in a manifold-ranking process [16]. and the sentences. Score s , which is calculated by the Table 1. in the specified document X  X  document context . study.

In the above algorithm, all sentences spread their ranking scores to their neighbors via the corresponding affinity graph, and the whole spreading process is repeated until a stable state is achieved and each sentence gets the user-context-based score. In this similarly. as contexts as follows: where N uc is the number of user contexts, and recommendation confidence of the user context sentence s i , which is calculated by the similarity between 2.3 Sentence Extraction In order to evaluate the importance of each sentence s i within the specified document based on social context, we fuse both the document-context based score () dc and the user-context based score where  X  to the sentence X  X  final score from the impact of document context and user context. If =1, only the document context X  X  impact is considered and the final score equals to Score s ; if equals to sentences with highest scores and least redundancy are chosen into the summary. 3.1 Data Set summarization, in this study, we construct a dataset to evaluate the proposed method by downloading 200 bookmarked CNN news web documents from delicious website 1 on diverse topics. The  X  X tory Highlights X  are extracted from each news document to form the gold-standard summary. 3.2 Evaluation Methods reference summaries. Formally, ROUGE-N is an n-gram recall based measurement as follows. maximum number of n-grams co-occurring in a candidate summary and a set of reference summaries. ROUGE-1 (unigram based metric), ROUGE-2 (bigram based metric), and ROUGE-SU4 (skip bigram and unigram based metric with maximum skip distance 4). 3.3 Experimental Results Porter Stemmer. All the sentences were represented as the term vectors. The process of redundancy removing and the setup of the corresponding parameters of the following baselines are also the same as that of the proposed approach. 
Given a document set, we implement the following baselines for comparison based sentences. 
Baseline-R: Baseline-R is implemented by extracting sentences randomly from the specified document to generate a summary. 
Baseline-DCI: Baseline-DCI computes the importance score of a sentence in the specified document based on only intra-document links between sentences, which can be computed by formula (2). 
Baseline-DC: Baseline-DC computes the importance score of a sentence in the sentences, which can be computed by formula (1). information is neglected. The proposed summarization approach SocialContextSum both document context and user context. We show the evaluation results of different approaches in Table 2. adjusting parameter  X  is set to 0.5. 
Seen from Table 2, the proposed approach (i.e. SocialContextSum ) using the social and user context are very important for improving the performance of single document summarization. proving more external clues related to the specified document. 3.4 Impact of the Adjusting Parameter  X  influences the summarization performance, we investigate tuning the weight adjusting parameter  X  . 
Figure 1 shows the ROUGE-1 evaluation results of the proposed approach with respect to the parameter  X  . information is important for improving document summarization performance. summarization approach can improve the pe rformance of document summarization is that there are many different online documents to discuss the same topic from various reliable. Although document summarization has been comprehensively analyzed in the past propose a collaborative summarization approach based on social contextual information. improvement of the proposed approach over several baselines and clearly highlight the potential benefits of the incorporatio n of social contextual information. other data sets with richer social contextu al information such as blog and micro-blog entries, comments on social networks, and other social bookmarking services, etc. In by making use of more implicit or explicit social media information from community user X  X  feedback to further improve summarization system X  X  performance.
