 Learning in the context of multiple languages simul-taneously has been shown to be beneficial to a num-ber of NLP tasks from morphological analysis to syntactic parsing (Kuhn, 2004; Snyder and Barzilay, 2010; McDonald et al., 2011). The goal of this work is to show that parallel data is useful in unsupervised induction of shallow semantic representations.
Semantic role labeling (SRL) (Gildea and Juraf-sky, 2002) involves predicting predicate argument structure, i.e. both the identification of arguments and their assignment to underlying semantic roles. For example, in the following sentences: the arguments  X  X eter X  ,  X  X ary X  , and  X  X lanning a theft X  of the predicate  X  X lame X  take the agent ( A 0 ), patient ( A 1 ) and reason ( A 2 ) roles, respectively. In this work, we focus on predicting argument roles.
SRL representations have many potential appli-cations in NLP and have recently been shown to benefit question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007; Kaisser and Webber, 2007), textual entailment (Sammons et al., 2009), machine translation (Wu and Fung, 2009; Liu and Gildea, 2010; Wu et al., 2011; Gao and Vogel, 2011), and dialogue systems (Basili et al., 2009; van der Plas et al., 2011), among others. Though syntactic representations are often predictive of semantic roles (Levin, 1993), the inter-face between syntactic and semantic representations is far from trivial. Lack of simple deterministic rules for mapping syntax to shallow semantics motivates the use of statistical methods.

Most of the current statistical approaches to SRL are supervised, requiring large quantities of human annotated data to estimate model parameters. How-ever, such resources are expensive to create and only available for a small number of languages and do-mains. Moreover, when moved to a new domain, performance of these models tends to degrade sub-stantially (Pradhan et al., 2008). Sparsity of anno-tated data motivates the need to look to alternative resources. In this work, we make use of unsuper-vised data along with parallel texts and learn to in-duce semantic structures in two languages simulta-neously. As does most of the recent work on unsu-pervised SRL, we assume that our data is annotated with automatically-predicted syntactic dependency parses and aim to induce a model of linking between syntax and semantics in an unsupervised way.
We expect that both linguistic relatedness and variability can serve to improve semantic parses in individual languages: while the former can pro-vide additional evidence, the latter can serve to re-duce uncertainty in ambiguous cases. For example, in our sentences (a) and (b) representing so-called blame alternation (Levin, 1993), the same informa-tion is conveyed in two different ways and a success-ful model of semantic role labeling needs to learn the corresponding linkings from the data. Induc-ing them solely based on monolingual data, though possible, may be tricky as selectional preferences of the roles are not particularly restrictive; similar restrictions for patient and agent roles may further complicate the process. However, both sentences (a) and (b) are likely to be translated in German as  X  [ A 0 Peter ] beschuldigte [ A 1 Mary ] [ A 2 einen Dieb-stahl zu planen ]  X  . Maximizing agreement between the roles predicted for both languages would pro-vide a strong signal for inducing the proper linkings in our examples.

In this work, we begin with a state-of-the-art monolingual unsupervised Bayesian model (Titov and Klementiev, 2012) and focus on improving its performance in the crosslingual setting. It induces a linking between syntax and semantics, encoded as a clustering of syntactic signatures of predicate ar-guments. The clustering implicitly defines the set of permissible alternations. For predicates present in both sides of a bitext, we guide models in both lan-guages to prefer clusterings which maximize agree-ment between predicate argument structures pre-dicted for each aligned predicate pair. We experi-mentally show the effectiveness of the crosslingual learning on the English-German language pair.
Our model admits efficient inference: the estima-tion time on CoNLL 2009 data (Haji  X  c et al., 2009) and Europarl v.6 bitext (Koehn, 2005) does not ex-ceed 5 hours on a single processor and the infer-ence algorithm is highly parallelizable, reducing in-ference time down to less than half an hour on mul-tiple processors. This suggests that the models scale to much larger corpora, which is an important prop-erty for a successful unsupervised learning method, as unlabeled data is abundant.

In summary, our contributions are as follows.  X  This work is the first to consider the crosslin- X  We propose a form of agreement penalty and  X  We demonstrate that efficient approximate in-
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-tion 2 begins with a definition of the crosslingual semantic role induction task we address in this pa-per. In Section 3, we describe the base monolingual model, and in Section 4 we propose an extension for the crosslingual setting. In Section 5, we describe our inference procedure. Section 6 provides both evaluation and analysis. Finally, additional related work is presented in Section 7. As we mentioned in the introduction, in this work we focus on the labeling stage of semantic role la-beling. Identification, though an important prob-lem, can be tackled with heuristics (Lang and Lap-ata, 2011a; Grenager and Manning, 2006; de Marn-effe et al., 2006) or potentially by using a supervised classifier trained on a small amount of data.
Instead of assuming the availability of role an-notated data, we rely only on automatically gener-ated syntactic dependency graphs in both languages. While we cannot expect that syntactic structure can trivially map to a semantic representation 1 , we can make use of syntactic cues. In the labeling stage, semantic roles are represented by clusters of ar-guments, and labeling a particular argument corre-sponds to deciding on its role cluster. However, in-stead of dealing with argument occurrences directly, we represent them as predicate-specific syntactic signatures, and refer to them as argument keys . This representation aids our models in inducing high pu-rity clusters (of argument keys) while reducing their granularity. We follow (Lang and Lapata, 2011a) and use the following syntactic features for English to form the argument key representation:
In the example sentences in Section 1, the argu-ment keys for candidate arguments Peter for sen-tences (a) and (c) would be ACT:LEFT:SBJ and PASS:RIGHT:LGS-&gt;by , 2 respectively. While aim-ing to increase the purity of argument key clusters, this particular representation will not always pro-duce a good match: e.g. planning a theft in sen-tence (b) will have the same key as Mary in sen-tence (a). Increasing the expressiveness of the ar-gument key representation by using features of the syntactic frame would enable us to distinguish that pair of arguments. However, we keep this particular representation, in part to compare with the previous work. In German, we do not include the relative po-sition features, because they are not very informative due to variability in word order.

In sum, we treat the unsupervised semantic role labeling task as clustering of argument keys. Thus, argument occurrences in the corpus whose keys are clustered together are assigned the same semantic role. The objective of this work is to improve ar-gument key clusterings by inducing them simulta-neously in two languages. In this section we describe one of the Bayesian mod-els for semantic role induction proposed in (Titov and Klementiev, 2012). Before describing our method, we briefly introduce the central compo-nents of the model: the Chinese Restaurant Pro-cesses (CRPs) and Dirichlet Processes (DPs) (Fer-guson, 1973; Pitman, 2002). For more details we refer the reader to (Teh, 2007). 3.1 Chinese Restaurant Processes CRPs define probability distributions over partitions of a set of objects. An intuitive metaphor for de-scribing CRPs is assignment of tables to restaurant customers. Assume a restaurant with a sequence of tables, and customers who walk into the restaurant one at a time and choose a table to join. The first customer to enter is assigned the first table. Sup-pose that when a client number i enters the restau-rant, i  X  1 customers are sitting at each of the k  X  (1 ,...,K ) tables occupied so far. The new cus-tomer is then either seated at one of the K tables with probability N k i  X  1+  X  , where N k is the number of customers already sitting at table k , or assigned to a new table with the probability  X  i  X  1+  X  ,  X  &gt; 0 .
If we continue and assume that for each table ev-ery customer at a table orders the same meal, with the meal for the table chosen from an arbitrary base distribution H , then all ordered meals will constitute a sample from the Dirichlet Process DP (  X ,H ) .
An important property of the non-parametric pro-cesses is that a model designer does not need to spec-ify the number of tables (i.e. clusters) a-priori as it is induced automatically on the basis of the data and also depending on the choice of the concentration parameter  X  . This property is crucial for our task, as the intended number of roles cannot possibly be specified for every predicate. 3.2 The Generative Story In Section 2 we defined our task as clustering of ar-gument keys, where each cluster corresponds to a semantic role. If an argument key k is assigned to a role r ( k  X  r ), all of its occurrences are labeled r .
The Bayesian model encodes two common as-sumptions about semantic roles. First, it enforces the selectional restriction assumption: namely it stip-ulates that the distribution over potential argument fillers is sparse for every role, implying that  X  X eaky X  distributions of arguments for each role r are pre-ferred to flat distributions. Second, each role nor-mally appears at most once per predicate occur-rence. The inference algorithm will search for a clustering which meets the above requirements to the maximal extent.

The model associates two distributions with each predicate: one governs the selection of argument fillers for each semantic role, and the other mod-els (and penalizes) duplicate occurrence of roles. Each predicate occurrence is generated indepen-dently given these distributions. Let us describe the model by first defining how the set of model param-eters and an argument key clustering are drawn, and then explaining the generation of individual predi-cate and argument instances. The generative story is formally presented in Figure 1.

For each predicate p , we start by generating a par-tition of argument keys B p with each subset r  X  B p representing a single semantic role. The parti-tions are drawn from CRP(  X  ) independently for each predicate. The crucial part of the model is the set of selectional preference parameters  X  p,r , the distribu-tions of arguments x for each role r of predicate p . We represent arguments by lemmas of their syntac-tic heads. 3
The preference for sparseness of the distributions  X  p,r is encoded by drawing them from the DP prior DP (  X ,H ( A ) ) with a small concentration parameter  X  , the base probability distribution H ( A ) is just the normalized frequencies of arguments in the corpus. The geometric distribution  X  p,r is used to model the number of times a role r appears with a given predi-cate occurrence. The decision whether to generate at least one role r is drawn from the uniform Bernoulli distribution. If 0 is drawn then the semantic role is not realized for the given occurrence, otherwise the number of additional roles r is drawn from the ge-ometric distribution Geom (  X  p,r ) . The Beta priors over  X  can indicate the preference towards generat-ing at most one argument for each role.

Now, when parameters and argument key clus-terings are chosen, we can summarize the remain-der of the generative story as follows. We begin by independently drawing occurrences for each predi-cate. For each predicate role we independently de-cide on the number of role occurrences. Then each of the arguments is generated (see GenArgument ) by choosing an argument key k p,r uniformly from the set of argument keys assigned to the cluster r , and finally choosing its filler x p,r , where the filler is the lemma of the syntactic head of the argument. As we argued in Section 1, our goal is to penalize for disagreement in semantic structures predicted for each language on parallel data. In doing so, as in much of previous work on unsupervised induction of linguistic structures, we rely on automatically pro-duced word alignments. In Section 6, we describe how we use word alignment to decide if two argu-ments are aligned; for now, we assume that (noisy) argument alignments are given.

Intuitively, when two arguments are aligned in parallel data, we expect them to be labeled with the same semantic role in both languages. This corre-spondence is simpler than the one expected in mul-tilingual induction of syntax and morphology where systematic but unknown relation between structures in two language is normally assumed (e.g., (Snyder et al., 2008)). A straightforward implementation of this idea would require us to maintain one-to-one mapping between semantic roles across languages. Instead of assuming this correspondence, we penal-ize for the lack of isomorphism between the sets of roles in aligned predicates with the penalty depen-dent on the degree of violation. This softer approach is more appropriate in our setting, as individual ar-gument keys do not always deterministically map to gold standard roles 4 and strict penalization would result in the propagation of the corresponding over-coarse clusters to the other language. Empirically, we observed this phenomenon on the held-out set with the increase of the penalty weight.

Encoding preference for the isomorphism directly in the generative story is problematic: sparse Dirich-let priors can be used in a fairly trivial way to encode sparsity of the mapping in one direction or another but not in both. Instead, we formalize this preference with a penalty term similar to the expectation criteria in KL-divergence form introduced in McCallum et al. (2007). Specifically, we augment the joint proba-bility with a penalty term computed on parallel data:
X ) r 0 ) of predicate p ( l 0 ) in language l 0 is aligned to the the total number of times the role is aligned,  X  ( l ) is a non-negative constant. The rationale for introducing the individual weighting f r ( l ) is two-fold. First, the computed from larger counts. Second, more fre-quent roles should have higher penalty as they com-pete with the joint probability term, the likelihood part of which scales linearly with role counts.
Space restrictions prevent us from discussing the close relation between this penalty formulation and the existing work on injecting prior and side infor-mation in learning objectives in the form of con-straints (McCallum et al., 2007; Ganchev et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2007).

In order to support efficient and parallelizable in-ference, we simplify the above penalty by consider-ing only disjoint pairs of predicates, instead of sum-ming over all pairs p (1) and p (2) . When choosing the pairs, we aim to cover the maximal number of alignment counts so as to preserve as much informa-tion from parallel corpora as possible. This objective corresponds to the classic maximum weighted bipar-tite matching problem with the weight for each edge p (1) and p (2) equal to the number of times the two predicates were aligned in parallel data. We use the standard polynomial algorithm (the Hungarian algo-rithm, (Kuhn, 1955)) to find an optimal solution. An inference algorithm for an unsupervised model should be efficient enough to handle vast amounts of unlabeled data, as it can easily be obtained and is likely to improve results. We use a simple approx-imate inference algorithm based on greedy search. We start by discussing search for the maximum a-posteriori clustering of argument keys in the mono-lingual set-up and then discuss how it can be ex-tended to accommodate the role alignment penalty. 5.1 Monolingual Setting In the model, a linking between syntax and seman-tics is induced independently for each predicate. Nevertheless, searching for a MAP clustering can be expensive: even a move involving a single ar-gument key implies some computations for all its occurrences in the corpus. Instead of more com-plex MAP search algorithms (see, e.g., (Daume III, 2007)), we use a greedy procedure where we start with each argument key assigned to an individual cluster, and then iteratively try to merge clusters. Each move involves (1) choosing an argument key and (2) deciding on a cluster to reassign it to. This is done by considering all clusters (including creating a new one) and choosing the most probable one.
Instead of choosing argument keys randomly at the first stage, we order them by corpus frequency. This ordering is beneficial as getting clustering right for frequent argument keys is more important and the corresponding decisions should be made earlier. 5 We used a single iteration in our experiments, as we have not noticed any benefit from using multiple it-erations. 5.2 Incorporating the Alignment Penalty Inference in the monolingual setting is done inde-pendently for each predicate, as the model factor-izes over the predicates. The role alignment penalty introduces interdependencies between the objectives for each bilingual predicate pair chosen by the as-signment algorithm as discussed in Section 4. For each pair of predicates, we search for clusterings to maximize the sum of the log-probability and the negated penalty term.

At first glance it may seem that the alignment penalty can be easily integrated into the greedy MAP search algorithm: instead of considering individual argument keys, one could use pairs of argument keys and decide on their assignment to clusters jointly. However, given that there is no isomorphic mapping between argument keys across languages, this solu-tion is unlikely to be satisfactory. 6 Instead, we use an approximate inference procedure similar in spirit to annotation projection techniques.

For each predicate, we first induce semantic roles independently for the first language, as described in Section 5.1, and then use the same algorithm for the second language but take the penalty term into account. Then we repeat the process in the reverse direction. Among these two solutions, we choose the one which yields the higher objective value. In this way, we begin with producing a clustering for the side which is easier to cluster and provides more clues for the other side. 7 We begin by describing the data and evaluation met-rics we use before discussing results. 6.1 Data We run our main experiments on the English-German section of Europarl v6 parallel corpus (Koehn, 2005) and the CoNLL 2009 distributions of the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus (Marcus et al., 1993) for English and the SALSA corpus (Burchardt et al., 2006) for German. As standard for unsuper-vised SRL, we use the entire CoNLL training sets for evaluation, and use held-out sets for model se-lection and parameter tuning.
 Syntactic annotation. Although the CoNLL 2009 dataset already has predicted dependency structures, we could not reproduce them so that we could use the same parser to annotate Europarl. We chose to reannotate it, since using different parsing models for both datasets would be undesirable. We used MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007) for English and the syntactic component of the LTH system (Johansson and Nugues, 2008) for German.
 Predicate and argument identification. We select all non-auxiliary verbs as predicates. For English, we identify their arguments using a heuristic proposed in (Lang and Lapata, 2011a). It is comprised of a list of 8 rules, which use nonlexicalized properties of syntactic paths between a predicate and a candi-date argument to iteratively discard non-arguments from the list of all words in a sentence. For Ger-man, we use the LTH argument identification classi-fier. Accuracy of argument identification on CoNLL 2009 using predicted syntactic analyses was 80.7% and 86.5% for English and German, respectively. Argument alignment. We use GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to produce word alignments in Europarl: we ran it in both directions and kept the intersec-tion of the induced word alignments. For every ar-gument identified in the previous stage, we chose a set of words consisting of the argument X  X  syntactic head and, for prepositional phrases, the head noun of the object noun phrase. We mark arguments in two languages as aligned if there is any word align-ment between the corresponding sets and if they are arguments of aligned predicates. 6.2 Evaluation Metrics We use the standard purity (PU) and collocation (CO) metrics as well as their harmonic mean (F1) to measure the quality of the resulting clusters. Purity measures the degree to which each cluster contains arguments sharing the same gold role: where C i is the set of arguments in the i -th induced cluster, G j is the set of arguments in the j th gold cluster, and N is the total number of arguments. Collocation evaluates the degree to which arguments with the same gold roles are assigned to a single cluster:
We compute the aggregate PU, CO, and F1 scores over all predicates in the same way as (Lang and La-pata, 2011a) by weighting the scores of each pred-icate by the number of its argument occurrences. Since our goal is to evaluate the clustering algo-rithms, we do not include incorrectly identified ar-guments when computing these metrics. 6.3 Parameters and Set-up Our models are robust to parameter settings; the pa-rameters were tuned (to an order of magnitude) to optimize the F 1 score on the held-out development set and were as follows. Parameters governing du-plicate role generation,  X  (  X  ) 0 and  X  (  X  ) 1 , and penalty weights  X  (  X  ) were set to be the same for both lan-guages, and are 100 , 1 .e -3 and 10 , respectively. The concentration parameters were set as follows: for English, they were set to  X  (1) = 1 .e -3 ,  X  (1) = 1 .e -3 , and, for German, they were  X  (2) = 0 . 1 ,  X  (2) = 1 .
Domains of Europarl (parliamentary proceedings) and German/English CoNLL data (newswire) are substantially different. Since the influence of do-main shift is not the focus of work, we try to min-imize its effect by computing the likelihood part of the objective on CoNLL data alone. This also makes our setting more comparable to prior work. 8 6.4 Results Base monolingual model. We begin by evaluat-ing our base monolingual model MonoBayes alone against the current best approaches to unsupervised semantic role induction. Since we do not have ac-cess to the systems, we compare on the marginally different English CoNLL 2008 (Surdeanu et al., 2008) shared task dataset used in their experiments. We report the results using gold argument identifi-cation and gold syntactic parses in order to focus the evaluation on the argument labeling stage and to minimize the noise due to automatic syntactic anno-tations. The methods are Latent Logistic classifica-tion (Lang and Lapata, 2010), Split-Merge cluster-ing (Lang and Lapata, 2011a), and Graph Partition-ing (Lang and Lapata, 2011b) (labeled LLogistic , SplitMerge , and GraphPart , respectively) achieving the current best unsupervised SRL results in this set-ting. Additionally, we compute the syntactic func-tion baseline ( SyntF ), which simply clusters predi-cate arguments according to the dependency relation to their head. Following (Lang and Lapata, 2010), we allocate a cluster for each of 20 most frequent relations in the CoNLL dataset and one cluster for all other relations. Our model substantially outper-forms other models (see Table 1).
 Multilingual extensions. Next, we improve our model performance using agreement as an addi-tional supervision signal during training (see Sec-tion 4). We compare the performance of indi-vidual English and German models induced sepa-rately ( MonoBayes ) with the jointly induced mod-els ( MultiBayes ) as well as the syntactic baseline, see Table 2. 9 While we see little improvement in F1 for English, the German system improves by 1.8%. For German, the crosslingual learning also results in 1.5% improvement over the syntac-tic baseline, which is considered difficult to outper-form (Grenager and Manning, 2006; Lang and Lap-ata, 2010). Note that recent unsupervised SRL meth-ods do not always improve on it, see Table 1.
The relatively low expressivity and limited purity of our argument keys (see discussion in Section 4) are likely to limit potential improvements when us-ing them in crosslingual learning. The natural next step would be to consider crosslingual learning with a more expressive model of the syntactic frame and syntax-semantics linking. Unsupervised learning in crosslingual setting has been an active area of research in recent years. How-ever, most of this research has focused on induc-tion of syntactic structures (Kuhn, 2004; Snyder et al., 2009) or morphologic analysis (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008) and we are not aware of any pre-vious work on induction of semantic representa-tions in the crosslingual setting. Learning of se-mantic representations in the context of monolin-gual weakly-parallel data was studied in Titov and Kozhevnikov (2010) but their setting was semi-supervised and they experimented only on a re-stricted domain.

Most of the SRL research has focused on the supervised setting, however, lack of annotated re-sources for most languages and insufficient cover-age provided by the existing resources motivates the need for using unlabeled data or other forms of weak supervision. This includes methods based on graph alignment between labeled and unlabeled data (F  X  urstenau and Lapata, 2009), using unlabeled data to improve lexical generalization (Deschacht and Moens, 2009), and projection of annotation across languages (Pado and Lapata, 2009; van der Plas et al., 2011). Semi-supervised and weakly-supervised techniques have also been explored for other types of semantic representations but these studies again have mostly focused on restricted do-mains (Kate and Mooney, 2007; Liang et al., 2009; Goldwasser et al., 2011; Liang et al., 2011).
Early unsupervised approaches to the SRL task include (Swier and Stevenson, 2004), where the VerbNet verb lexicon was used to guide unsuper-vised learning, and a generative model of Grenager and Manning (2006) which exploits linguistic priors on syntactic-semantic interface.

More recently, the role induction problem has been studied in Lang and Lapata (2010) where it has been reformulated as a problem of detecting al-ternations and mapping non-standard linkings to the canonical ones. Later, Lang and Lapata (2011a) pro-posed an algorithmic approach to clustering argu-ment signatures which achieves higher accuracy and outperforms the syntactic baseline. In Lang and La-pata (2011b), the role induction problem is formu-lated as a graph partitioning problem: each vertex in the graph corresponds to a predicate occurrence and edges represent lexical and syntactic similarities be-tween the occurrences. Unsupervised induction of semantics has also been studied in Poon and Domin-gos (2009) and Titov and Klementiev (2011) but the induced representations are not entirely compatible with the PropBank-style annotations and they have been evaluated only on a question answering task for the biomedical domain. Also, a related task of unsupervised argument identification has been con-sidered in Abend et al. (2009). This work adds unsupervised semantic role labeling to the list of NLP tasks benefiting from the crosslin-gual induction setting. We show that an agreement signal extracted from parallel data provides indi-rect supervision capable of substantially improving a state-of-the-art model for semantic role induction.
Although in this work we focused primarily on improving performance for each individual lan-guage, cross-lingual semantic representation could be extracted by a simple post-processing step. In future work, we would like to model cross-lingual semantics explicitly.
