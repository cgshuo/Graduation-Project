 Twitter summarizes the great deal of messages posted by users in the form of trending topics that reflect the top con-versations being discussed at a given moment. These trend-ing topics tend to be connected to current affairs. Different happenings can give rise to the emergence of these trending topics. For instance, a sports event broadcasted on TV, or a viral meme introduced by a community of users. Detecting the type of origin can facilitate information filtering, enhance real-time data processing, and improve user experience. In this paper, we introduce a typology to categorize the triggers that leverage trending topics: news, current events, memes, and commemoratives. We define a set of straightforward language-independent features that rely on the social spread of the trends to discriminate among those types of trending topics. Our method provides an efficient way to immediately and accurately categorize trending topics without need of external data, outperforming a content-based approach.

 Next, in Section 2 we describe Twitter X  X  trending topics. In Section 3 we summarize the related work. Then, in Sec-tion 4 we introduce a typology to organize trending topics by type of triggers, and detail the dataset used in the ex-periments. We propose a set of features, describe the trend classification experiments, and discuss the results in Section 5. Finally, we conclude the work in Section 6.
One of the main features on the homepage of Twitter shows a list of top terms so-called trending topics at all times. These terms reflect the topics that are being dis-cussed most in the latest minutes on the site X  X  stream of tweets. In order to avoid topics that are always popular, Twitter focuses on topics that are being discussed much more than usual, i.e., topics that recently suffered an in-crease of use, so that it trended for some reason. Trend-ing topics have generated big interest not only for the users themselves but also for information seekers such as jour-nalists, real-time application developers, and social media researchers. Being able to know the top conversations being discussed at a given time helps keep updated about current affairs, and discover the main concerns of the community. Twitter defines trending topics as  X  X opics that are immedi-ately popular, rather than topics that have been popular for a while or on a daily basis X  2 . A trending topic is made up by the topic itself  X  X .e., the term that became a trend X , and a stream of tweets containing that topic.
So far, most of the work on Twitter has focused on an-alyzing the microblogging phenomenon [5, 7], modeling the information diffusion on the social network [13, 14] and an-alyzing the content of tweets [12, 10, 4].

Regarding the classification of single tweets, Sriram et al. [12] define a typology of five generic classes of tweets (news, events, opinions, deals, and private messages) in order to improve information filtering. The authors represent tweets using a small set of language-dependent features to classify tweets written in English. The use of these features out-performs the bag-of-words approach in the classification of tweets according to the typology. We believe that this ty-pology, specifically defined for single tweets, does not fit the nature of triggers that leverage trending topics. Further-more, this typology does not intend to classify by type of trigger. For instance, it is not intuitive to include a trend-ing topic produced by a memorial day in this typology.
Little work has been done analyzing the properties of trending topics on Twitter. Most of them focus on event and topic detection [1, 2, 10]. Asur et al. [1] explore the longevity of trending topics on Twitter, and analyze the role of users in the emergence of trends. They found that (i) a few users are trend-setters , i.e, early contributors in the emergence of http://support.twitter.com/articles/101125-about-trending-topics
Twitter selects 10 trending topics that are being discussed most at the moment. Using Twitter X  X  top trends and search API methods, we monitored the trending topics shown on the site from March 1st to 7th. The list of top 10 trending topics was requested every 30 seconds. Thus, the process guarantees the detection of a trending topic almost as soon as it appears on the site, with a delay of 30 seconds in the worst scenario. As soon as a new topic appeared in the list of trends, another process queried the search API for the lat-est tweets containing the topic as a query term. Following this process, we collected a total of 1,036 unique trending topics. These trends include a total of 567,452 tweets from 348,757 different users. Accordingly, each of the 1,036 trend-ing topics in the dataset contains an average of about 548 associated tweets. All these tweets are written in 28 differ-ent languages, with a majority of 295,082 tweets written in English, 76,628 in Spanish, 67,673 in Portuguese, 31,685 in Dutch, and 22,863 in Indonesian. Moreover, there is not a trending topic with just one language in the dataset.
All these topics were manually categorized within the ty-pology we defined: news, current events, memes, or com-memoratives. Each trending topic was included into just one type. To provide the annotations, the stream of tweets corresponding to a trending topic was read carefully. After understanding the trigger that caused the conversation to become a trending topic, the annotation was provided. Due to the large number of languages contained in the collection, machine translators were used for unknown languages. The annotation produced an organization of the 1,036 trending topics in groups of 616 current events, 251 memes, 142 news, and 27 commemoratives.
Next, we present the features to characterize trending top-ics, and the classification experiments.
As an approach to discovering the type of a trending topic, we propose 15 social features that consider the way it spreads. Furthermore, since we want to categorize a trend-ing topic as soon as it appears trending on the site, the features must be straightforward, easy to get, and cheap to compute while the system performs accurately. This would ensure the immediacy of computation, and the ability to predict the type of a trending topic on the fly, as soon as it appears on the Twitter X  X  list. Moreover, these features are independent of the language used in tweets, and do not depend on the vocabulary utilized by users.

On one hand, we use average number of occurrences of fea-tures in the tweets corresponding to a trend. Each average computed as the arithmetic mean is the result of dividing the number of occurrences of the corresponding feature in the whole trend by the total number of tweets gathered for the trending topic. Note that the number of tweets in a topic that just trended is relatively small (average of 548 tweets). We propose 10 different features that rely on average val-ues: (1) Level of retweets (the number of retweeting users to reach the current state of a tweet), (2) Ratio of retweets out of all tweets, (3) Hashtags, (4) Length of tweets, (5) Table 2: Precision by class (N: News; CE: Cur-rent Events; M: Memes; C: Commemoratives) of the trend classification by type of representation based on the proposed Twitter features achieves a superior accuracy than the bag-of-words baseline. This superiority gap is of 3.2% in favor of the representation based on Twitter features. Furthermore, the winning approach presents the advantages that the features are straightforward and easy to compute, and that it only requires 15 features instead of the thousands required by the content-based representation. Cohen X  X  kappa values in Table 1 show the impact of ran-domness on the agreement between predicted and observed classifications. Note that the higher is the value, the lower is the effect of randomness on the accuracy improvement. It can be observed that the kappa values follow the same rank as the accuracy values, so that it indicates that the accuracy improvement is not a consequence of random guesses. When analyzing in more depth the precision by class (see Table 2), it can be seen that Twitter features perform bet-ter in the detection of current events, and especially memes, where the gap is bigger than 9%. Using the bag-of-words im-proves for news, and especially for commemoratives, where Twitter features get low precision. However, this could be due to the small number of co mmemoratives in the collec-tion 4 , and it may perform better with more trends of this type, probably providing a better representation of the class in the training stage.
In this work, we have explored the types of triggers that leverage conversations on Twitter. We have introduced a typology to organize Twitter X  X  trending topics by the type of happening that caused them. This typology includes the following 4 types of trending topics: news , current events , memes ,and commemoratives .

We aimed at characterizing trending topics so that we were able to organize them by type. To this end, we have set out 15 straightforward features to represent trending top-ics. These features are independent of the language used in the tweets, rely on the social diffusion of the trending topic, and only require tweets sent before the topic trended, with-out need of external data. The proposed method provides an immediate way to accurately organize trending topics. Unlike for the content-based representation, the number of features remains unchanged, and does not increase as the collection grows. Using SVM classifiers upon these features to discriminate types of trending topics showed that the pro-posed features provide more ac curate classification results than the use of textual content of tweets.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work introducing a typology of trending topics, and providing a method to immediately classify trending topics as soon as
Note that there are only 27 commemorative trends in the collection.
