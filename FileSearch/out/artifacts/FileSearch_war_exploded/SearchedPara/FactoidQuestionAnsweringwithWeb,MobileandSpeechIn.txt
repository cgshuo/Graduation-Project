 The approach to factoid question answering (QA) that we adopt was first described in (Whittak er et al., 2005b) where the details of the mathematical model and how it was trained for English were given. The approach has been successfully evalu-ated in the 2005 text retrie val conference (TREC) question answering track evaluations (Voorhees and Trang Dang, 2005) where our group placed ele venth out of thirty participants (Whittak er et al., 2005a). Although the TREC QA task is substantially dif fer -ent to web-based QA this evaluation sho wed that our approach works and pro vides an objecti ve assess-ment of its quality . Similarly , for our Japanese lan-guage system we have evaluated the performance of our approach on the NTCIR-3 QA C-1 task (Whit-tak er et al., 2005c). Although our Japanese ex-periments were applied retrospecti vely , the results would have placed us in the mid-range of partici-pating systems. In (Whittak er et al., 2006b) we de-scribed how our approach could be used for the rapid development of web-based QA systems in five very dif ferent languages. It was sho wn that a developer proficient with the tools, and with access to suitable training data, could build a system in a new language in around 10 hours. In (Whittak er et al., 2006a) we evaluated the performance of the systems for four of our five languages. We give a brief summary of our approach to QA in Section 2.
 In this paper we introduce our web-based QA system which is publicly accessible at http://asked.jp , permitting questions in En-glish, Japanese, Chinese, Russian and Swedish and is discussed in Section 3. Since answers in factoid QA are inherently well-suited to display on small screens we have also made a mobile-phone interf ace which is accessible at the same address when using an HTML bro wser from a mobile phone. This is dis-cussed in Section 4. There are several other QA sys-tems on the web including Brainboost (Brainboost, 2005) and Le xxe (Le xxe, 2005) but the y only try to answer questions in English and do not have con ve-nient mobile interf aces.

Entering whole questions rather than just key-words is tedious especially on a mobile-phone so we have also begun to look at speech interf aces. In this paper we describe a prototype speech interf ace to our English-language QA system. This prototype is currently intended primarily as a platform for fur -ther research into speech recognition and answering of questions from an acoustic modelling point-of-vie w (e.g. low-bandwidth, low-quality VoIP chan-nel), from a language modelling perspecti ve (e.g. ir-regular word order in questions vs. text, and very lar ge out-of-v ocab ulary problem) and also in terms of dialog modelling. There have been several at-tempts at speech interf aces to QA systems in the lit-erature e.g. (Schofield and Zheng, 2003) but as far as we kno w ours is the only system that is publicly accessible. We discuss this interf ace in Section 5. The answer to a question depends primarily on the question itself but also on man y other factors such as the person asking the question, the location of the person, what questions the person has ask ed before, and so on. For simplicity , we choose to consider only the dependence of an answer on the question . In particular , we hypothesize that the answer depends on two sets of features extracted from : where can be thought of as a set of features describing the  X  X uestion-type X  part of such as who , when , wher e , whic h , etc. and is a set of fea-tures comprising the  X  X nformation-bearing X  part of it refers to. For example, in the questions, Wher e is Mount Ever est? and How high is Mount Ever -est? the information-bearing component is identical in both cases whereas the question-type component is dif ferent.

Making various condi-tional independence assumptions to simplify mod-The model which models the probability of an answer sequence given a set of information-bearing fea-tures . It models the proximity of to features in . This model is referred to as the retrie val model . The features in the question-type set . Roughly speak-ing this model relates ways of asking a question with classes of valid answers. For example, it associates names of people or companies with who -type ques-tions. In general, there are man y valid and equiprob-able for a given so this component can only re-rank candidate answers retrie ved by the retrie val model. Consequently , we call it the filter model . The web-based interf ace to our QA systems has been accessible at http://asked.j p since Decem-ber 2005 and although still primarily a research sys-tem and not widely adv ertised it attracts around five unique users a day . Currently we do not perform language detection for an input question so the user must first select a language-specific system before inputting a question in a language other than En-glish.

In Figure 1 we sho w the results page for the ques-tion  X  X ow high is Mount Ever est? X  . As can be seen the left-hand side of the page contains the familiar title, link and summaries of pages rele vant to the query that is common to most of today X  s web search engines. These results are produced by an open-source web search engine which is run locally and currently contains about 100 million web-pages in its database. Do wn the right-hand side of the results page we present the answers that were found by our QA system. These answers are presented in order of probability as determined by Equation (3). When the mouse is rolled over an answer a Java-script pop-up box is displayed that sho ws more conte xt for a given answer . This allo ws the user to determine more rapidly the validity of an answer and also par -tially compensates for inaccurate answer identifica-tion by the system. Each answer can also be click ed on whereupon the user is redirected to the page from which the answer was tak en. This re-direction is ef-fected through a redirect via our own web-serv er so that for a given question we can see which answers were click ed on. Ev entually , it is hoped this could be used for unsupervised system adaptation.
The same basic layout and design is repeated for each of the five language-specific systems. In Fig-ure 2 we sho w the results page for the Japanese ques-tion of  X  X hat plant do Pandas eat? X  .

The average response time to present the full re-sults page for a question in each language is cur -rently around 10 seconds. The web-search and QA systems are run in parallel and the outputs combined when both are complete.
 Since the priorities with a mobile-phone interf ace re-volv e around speed, display size and cost to the user , the interf ace is basically a whittled down version of the web-based interf ace described in the pre vious section. The only requirement for being able to use the mobile phone interf ace is that the phone must contain an HTML bro wser . In countries lik e Japan this has been fairly standard for man y years but it is expected that this will become more common world-wide in the near future with the continued roll-out of 3G mobile phone services.

For the mobile-phone interf ace the standard web-search results section has been remo ved entirely from the results section and instead only the top 20 short answers are displayed without pop-up box es or corresponding conte xt. Such a strate gy mini-mizes the number of bytes transmitted and ensures that most answers are adequately displayed on most mobile-phone interf aces with a minimum amount of scrolling. Although not yet implemented we aim to allo w users to click on an answer and be tak en to the part of the page that contains the answer rather than loading a whole page which could sometimes be several me gabytes in size. Our implementation of the speech interf ace to the QA system was greatly simplified by the avail-ability of the Voxeo developer platform 1 which pro vides free access, for development purposes, to a VoiceXML bro wser running our application. The application can be accessed through: (i) a U.S. telephone number at (800) 289-5570 then PIN:9991423955 ; (ii) SIP VoIP clients at ( SIP:9991423955s ip.voxeo.net ); (iii) Free World Dialup at ( **86919991423955 ); and (iv) Sk ypeOut at ( +99000936 9991423955 ).
Since most VoiceXML applications are designed for use with small vocab ulary , rule-based gram-mars we only use VoiceXML and Voxeo X  s bro wser to handle negotiation of the questions and answers with the user through simple dialogs. The recog-nition of the question itself is performed using a dedicated lar ge-v ocab ulary speech recognizer with a language model (LM) trained on English-language questions. The speech recognizer we use is the open-source Sphinx-4 recognizer (W alk er et al., 2004) which runs in a serv er mode and has been adapted to use more comple x LMs than those per -mitted by the def ault ARP A format word -gram LMs. Currently we use a linear interpolation of a word and class-based trigram LM each of which were trained on a lar ge corpus of English-language questions (Hallmarks, 2002) X  X he same data used to train the English-language QA system (Whittak er et al., 2005b). Ha ving recapped a basic overvie w of our statistical approach to question answering (QA), in this paper we have described the web and mobile-phone in-terf aces to our multi-language QA system and how the y can be accessed. In addition, we have de-scribed our first attempt at a prototype speech in-terf ace which will be used as a platform for future research. Ev entually our aim is to mak e the QA per -formance of the speech interf ace the same as that obtained through the web and mobile-phone inter -faces. This will be achie ved through a combination of acoustic, language and dialog model adaptation on the speech side, and making the QA system more rob ust to underspecified and errorful questions on the QA side. We think these demonstration systems sho w significant progress has already been made and give a hint of how information access to QA systems might be achie ved in the near future.
