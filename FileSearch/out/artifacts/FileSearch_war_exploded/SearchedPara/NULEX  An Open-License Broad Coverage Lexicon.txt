While there are many types of parsers available, all of them rely on a lexicon of words , whether synt actic like Comlex, enriched with semantics like WordNet, or derived from tagged corpora like the Penn Treebank (Macl e od et al , 1994; Fel l baum, 1998; Marcus et al , 1993 ). However, many of these resources have gaps that the others can fill in. WordNet , for e xample , only contains open -class words , and it lacks the extensive subcategorization frame and agreement information present in Comlex ( Miller et al , 1993 ; Macl e od et al , 1994). Comlex, while syntactically deep, doesn X  X  have tagged usage data or semantic g roupings (Macl e od et al , 1994) . Furthermore, many of these resources do not map to one another or have restricted licenses.

The goal of our research was to create a syntactic lexicon, like Comlex , that unified multiple existing open -source resources including Felbaum X  X  (1998) WordNet, Kipper et al  X  X  (2000) VerbNet, and Wiktionary. Furthermore, we wanted it to have direct links to frame semantic representations via the open -license Open Cyc knowledg e base.

The result was NU -LEX a lexicon of over 100,000 words that has the coverage of WordNet, is enriched with tense information from automatically screen -scrapping Wiktionary 1 , and contains VerbNet subcategorization frames. This lexicon was incorporate d into a bottom -up chart parser, EANLU, that connects the words to Cyc representations (Tomai &amp; Forbus 2009) . Each entry is represented by Cyc assertions and contains syntactic i nformation as a set of features consistent with previous feature systems (Alle n 1995; Macl e od et al , 1994).
Comlex is handmade and contains 38,000 lemmas . It represents words in feature value lists that contain lexical data such as part of speech, agreement information, and syntactic frame participation (Macl e od et al , 1994). Furthermore, Comlex has extensive mappings to , and uses representations compatible with , multiple lexical resources (M a cl e od et al , 1994).

Attempts to automatically create syntactic lexical resources from tagged corpora have also been successful . The Penn Treebank is one such resource ( Marcus et al, 1993 ). These resources have been successfully incorporated into statistical parsers such as the Apple Pie parser (Sekine &amp; Grishman, 1995). Unfortunately, they still require extensive labor to do the annotations.
NU -LEX is different in that it is automatically compiled without relying on a hand -annotated corpus. Instead, it combines crowd -sourced data, Wiktionary, with existing lexical resour ces.
This research was possible because of the existing lexica l resources WordNet and VerbNet. WordNet is a virtual thesaurus that groups words together by semantic similarity into synsets representing a lexical concept ( Felbaum, 1998 ). VerbNet is an exte nsion of Levin X  X  (1993) verb class research. It represents verb meaning in a class hierarchy where each verb in a class has similar semantic meanings and identical syntactic usages (Kipper et al , 2000). Since its creation it has been expanded to include cl asses not in Levin X  X  original research (Kipper et al , 2006). These two resources have already been mapped , which facilitated applyi ng subcategorization frames to WordNet verbs.
 Furthermore, WordNet has existing links to OpenCyc. OpenCyc is an open -source version of the ResearchCyc knowledge base that contains hierarchical definitional information but is missing much of the lower level instantiated facts and linguistic knowledge of ResearchCyc (Matuszek et al , 2006). Previous research by McFate (2010) used these links and VerbNet hierarchies to create verb semantic frames which are used in EANLU, the parser NU -LEX was tested on. The NU -LEX describes words as CycL assertions . Each form of a word has its own entry. For the purposes of integrati on into a parser that already uses Comlex, the formatting was kept similar. Because the lexification process is automatic, formatting changes are easy to implement. 3.1 Nouns Noun lemmas were initially taken from Fellbaum X  X  (1998) WordNet index. Each Lemma was then queried in Wiktionary to retrieve its plural form resulting in a triple of word , POS , and plural form : This was used to create a definition for each form. Each definition contains a list of WordNet synsets from the original word, the orthographic word form which was assumed to be the same as the word, countability taken from Wiktionary when available, the root which was the base form of the word, and the agreement which was either singular or plural. 3.2 Verbs Like Nouns, verb base lemmas were taken from the WordNet index. Simi larly, each verb was queried in Wiktionary to retrieve its tense forms resulting in a list similar to that for nouns: These lists in turn were used to create the word , form , and agreement information for a verb entry. The subcategorization frames w ere taken directly from VerbNet. Root and Orthographical form were again kept the same. 3.3 Adjectives and Adverbs Adjectives and adverbs were simply taken fro m WordNet . No information from W iktionary was added for this version of NU -LEX, so it does not include comparative or superlative forms. This will be added in future iterations by using Wiktionary. The lack of comparatives and superlatives caused no errors. Each definition contains the Word , POS , and Synset list : 3.4 Manual A dditions WordNet only contains open -class words: Nouns, Adjectives, Adverbs, and Ve rbs (Miller et al, 1993) . Thus determiners, subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, and pronouns all had to be hand created.

Likewise, Be -verbs had to be manually added as the Wiktionary page proved too difficult to parse. These were the only categories added.

Notably, proper names and cardinal numbers are missing from NU -LEX. Numbers are repre sented as nouns, but not as cardinals or ordinals. These categories were not explicit in WordNet (Miller et al, 1993). The sample sentences consisted of 50 samples from the Simple English Wikipedia 2 articles on the heart, lungs, and George Washington. The heart set consisted of the first 25 sentences of the article , not counting pare nthetical s . The lungs set consisted of the first 13 sentences of the article. The George Washington set consisted of the first 12 sentences of that article. These sets corresponded to the first section or first two sections of each article. There were 239 unique words in the whole set out of 599 words total. Each set was parsed by the EANLU parser .
 EANLU is a bottom -up chart parser that uses compositional semantics to translate natural language into Cyc predicate calculus representations (Tomai &amp; Forbus 20 09). It is based on a Allen X  X  (1995) parser. It runs on top of the FIRE reasoning engine which it uses to query the Cyc KB (Forbus et al , 2010).

Each sentence was evaluated as correct based on whether or not it return ed the proper word forms. Since we are not evaluating EANLU  X  X  grammar , we did not formally evaluate the parser X  X  ability to generate a complete parse from the lex -ite ms, but we note informally that parse completeness was generall y the same. Failure occurred if a ny lex -item was not retrieved or if the parser was unable to parse the sentence due to system memory constraints. Can NU -LEX perform comparably to existing syntactic resources despite being automatically compiled from multiple resources? Does its increased coverage significantly improve parsing? How accurate is this lexicon?
In particular we wanted to uncover words that disappeared or were represented incorrectly as a result of the screen -scraping process.
 Overall, across all 50 samples NU -LEX and Comlex performed similarly . NULE X got 25 out of 50 (50%) correct and Comlex got 26 out of 50 (52%) of the sentences correct. The two systems made many of the same errors, and a primary source of errors was the lack of proper nouns in either resource. Proper nouns caused seven sentences t o fail in both parsers or 29% of total errors. 
Of the NU -LEX failures not caused by proper nouns, f ive of them (20%) were caused by lacking cardinal numbers. The rest were due to missing lex -items across several categories. Comlex primarily failed due to missing medical terminology in the lungs and heart test set.

Out of the total 239 unique words, NULEX failed on 11 unique wo rds not counting proper nouns or cardinal numbers. One additional failure was due to the missing pronoun  X  themselves X  which was retr oactively added to the hand created pronoun section. This a failure rate of 4.6%. Comlex failed on 6 unique words , not counting proper nouns, giving it a failure rate of 2.5%. 5.1 The Heart For the heart set 25 sentences were run through the parser. Using NU -L EX, the system correctly identified the lex -items for 17 out of 25 sentences (68 %). Of the sentence s it did not get correct, f ive were incorrect only because of the lack of cardinal number representation . One failed because of system memory constraints.

Us ing Comlex, the parser correctly identified all lex -items for 16 out of 25 sentences (64%). The sentences it got wrong all failed because of missing medical terms . In particular, atrium and vena cava caused lexical errors. 5.2 The Lungs For the lung set 13 sen tences were run through the parser. Using NU -LEX the system correctly identified all lex -items for 6 out of 13 sentences (46%). Two errors were caused by the lack of cardinal number representation and one sentence failed due to memory constraints. One sent ence failed because of the medical specific term para -bronchi . 
Four additional errors were due to a malformed verb definition s and missing lexite ms lost during screen scraping.

Using Comlex the parser correctly identified all lex -items for 7 out of 13 se ntences (53%). Five failures were caused by missing lex -items, namely medical terminology like alveoli and parabronchi . One sentence failed due to system memory constraints. 5.3 George Washington For the George Washington set 12 sentences were run through the parser. This was a set that we expected to cause problems for NU -LEX and Comlex because of the lack of proper noun representation. NU -LEX got only 2 out of 12 correct and seven of these errors were caused by proper nouns such as George Washington . 
Comlex did not perform much better , getting 3 out of 12 (25%) correc t. All but one of the Comlex errors was caused by missing proper nouns. NU -LEX is unique in that it is a syntactic lexicon automatically compiled from several open -source resources an d a crowd -sourced web site . Like these resources it too is open -license . We X  X e demonstrated that its performance is on par with existing state of the art resources like Comlex. By virtue of being automatic, NU -LEX can be easily updated or reformatted. Becau se it scrapes Wiktionary for tense information, NU -LEX can constantly evolve to include new forms or corrections. As its coverage ( over 100,000 word s) is derived from Fellbaum X  X  (1998) WordNet, it is also significantly larger than existing similar syntacti c resources. 
NU -LEX X  X  first trial demonstrated that it was suitable for general purpose parsing. However, much work remains to be done. T he majority of errors in the experiments were caused by either missing numbers or missing proper nouns. Cardinal numbe rs could be easily added to improve performance. Furthermore, solutions to missing numbers could be created on the grammar side of the process.

Missing proper nouns represent both a gap and an opportunity. One approach in the future could be to manually a dd important people or places as needed. Because the lexicon is Cyc compliant, other options could include querying the Cyc KB for people and then explicitly representing the examples as definitions. This method has already proven successful for EANLU usin g ResearchCyc, and could transfer well to OpenCyc. Screen -scraping Wiktionary could also yield proper nouns.

With proper noun and number coverage, total failures would have been reduced by 48% . Thus, simple automated additions in the future can greatly enhance performance.

Errors caused by missing or malformed definitions were not abundant , showing up in only 12 of the 50 parses and under half of the total errors. The total error rate for words was only 4.6%. We believe that improvements to the screen -scrapping program or changes in Wiktionary could lead to improvements in the future.

Because it is CycL compliant the entire lexicon can be formally represented in the Cyc knowledge base (Matuszek e t al , 2006). This supports efficient reasoning and allows systems that use NU -LEX to easily make use of the Cyc KB. It is easily ada ptable in LISP or Cyc based applications. When partnered with the EANLU parser and McFate X  X  (2010) OpenCyc verb frames, the resu lt is a semantic parser that uses completely open -license resources.

It is our hope that NU -LEX will provide a powerful tool for the natural language community both on its own and combined with existing resources . In turn, we hope that it becomes bett er through use in future iterations.
