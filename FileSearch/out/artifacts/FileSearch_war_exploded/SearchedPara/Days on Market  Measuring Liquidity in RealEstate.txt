 Days on Market (DOM) refers to the number of days a prop-erty is on the active market, which is an important mea-surement of market liquidity in real estate industry. Indeed, at the micro level, DOM is not only a special concern of house sellers, but also a useful indicator for potential buy-ers to evaluate the popularity of a house. At the macro level, DOM is an important indicator of real estate market status. However, it is very challenging to measure DOM, since there are a variety of factors which can impact on the DOM of a property. To this end, in this paper, we aim to measure real estate liquidity by examining multiple fac-tors in a holistic manner. A special goal is to predict the DOM of a given property listing. Specifically, we first ex-tract key features from multiple types of heterogeneous real estate-related data, such as house profiles and geo-social in-formation of residential communities. Then, based on these features, we develop a multi-task learning based regression approach for predicting the DOM of real estates. This ap-proach can effectively learn district-aware models for differ-ent property listings by considering multiple factors. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world real estate data collected in Beijing and develop a prototype system for practical use. The experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for measuring liquid-ity in real estate markets.
 Days on Market, Real Estate, Multi-Task Learning
Real estate is an important investment option in many countries and has traditionally outperformed the stock mar-ket [1]. However, real estate has limited liquidity compared to other investments [28]. Days on Market (DOM) is an important measurement for market liquidity in real estate industry, as it refers to the number of days a property is on the active market. At the micro level, DOM is a special concern of property sellers because real estate is highly cash flow dependent [1]. Also, it is a useful indicator for poten-tial buyers to evaluate the popularity of the estate [25, 28]. Moreover, at the macro level, DOM is an important indica-tor of the liquidity of the real estate market and shows the level of risk associated with real estate investments. In the literature, there are a number of studies about DOM related topics [27, 18, 25, 28, 16]. However, most of existing works focus on developing interpretable models for discerning the relationship between DOM and market-ing features, such as listing/selling prices. Less efforts have been made for developing predictive methods for measuring DOM, which is very critical for many parties in real estate industry. To this end, in this paper, we aim to measure real estate liquidity by examining multiple underlying factors in a holistic manner. Along this line, an important objective is to model and predict the DOM of a given property listing. The right prediction of DOM could provide valuable insights for both sellers and buyers of real estates and enable the information transparency between sellers and buyers. For example, a seller would know how long it will probably take to sell the house at a certain price using our system. There-fore, the seller could adjust the price to influence the ex-pected DOM. If it turns out that well-decorated houses are more popular (with short DOM) on the market, the seller could also decorate the house to make it more popular. In addition, the developed system can help identify the decep-tive manipulations [28] on DOM, and thus could lead to the healthy development of the real estate industry.

However, it is very challenging to predict the DOM of a property because DOM is potentially affected by many fac-tors, such as price, location, and the year of completion in a complicated and involved way. To this end, we first collect and investigate a variety of real estate-related data including transaction records, estate profiles and geo-social informa-tion of residential communities. By carefully studying our real-world data, we find that some of these factors are only weakly correlated with DOM. For instance, although some attributes from property profiles (e.g., unit price) can be re-garded as intuitively discriminant information for DOM pre-diction, it turns out that they have limited prediction power for DOM because most property listings within the same urban district have very similar profile attributes. There-fore, we extract various contextual features for establishing the key factors that affect the sale of real estates. These feature include the heterogeneous house profile and the geo-social information of residential communities, such as the number of available facilities (e.g., school and hospital) in the neighborhood, population density, news, and the aver-age monthly DOM of housing sales in the same community. Then, to make full use of all relevant features, we develop a multi-task learning based regression approach for DOM prediction, which can effectively learn district-aware predic-tion models capturing the geographical correlations of real estates. Figure 1 demonstrates the work flow overview of our approach. Finally, we evaluate our approach by conducting extensive experiments with a large amount of real-world es-tate related data in Beijing, which include 10K+ residential communities, 145K+ transaction records, 740K+ real estate news, 500K+ points of interests (POIs), and 59M+ GPS re-quests. Experimental results have demonstrated the effec-tiveness of the proposed method. In addition, we develop a prototype system for practical use, which clearly shows the value of the proposed decision support system.

Overview. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the details of large-scale real estate data sets. Section 3 presents how to extract con-textual features for DOM prediction. In Section 4, we intro-duce the technical details of our DOM prediction model by exploiting multi-task learning. In Section 5, we report the experimental results of DOM prediction. Section 6 provides a brief review of related works. Finally, in Section 7, we conclude the paper.
In this section, we introduce a variety of real-estate related data sets that we have used in developing our multi-task learning based regression method and the DOM decision support system. In summary, Table 2 shows the statistics of our real-world data sets.
In this study, we use two sets of marketing data collected from a major commercial real estate agency in China.
The first one is a long-term real estate transaction data set, which contains 145,932 transaction records from Octo-ber 2011 to November 2013 in Beijing. Figure 2 (a) shows the distribution of the number of transactions with respect to different length of DOM. We can observe that most of house listings only have very short DOM, which clearly indi-cates the prosperity of real estate markets in China. Indeed, this distribution is quite different from that of another data set from Realtor [3] in US, shown in Figure 2 (b). There-fore, we believe, this study can provide valuable insights into Chinese real estate markets.

Each transaction record in our data set also contains the profile of the listed house, including the residential commu-nity the house belongs to 1 , DOM, price, location, room number, area, list date, whether it is free of sales tax, ori-entation, the realtor who facilitated this transaction, etc. Specifically, the top part of Table 1 shows some basic statis-tics of the above attributes in our data set. Figure 3 shows the distributions of DOM, unit price and transaction num-ber with respect to list time in our data set. From these figures, we can have some very interesting findings. First, the average unit price has grown steadily in Beijing. Second, there is a burst of transaction volume in March 2013, which is due to the  X  ve policies and measures to regulate real es-tate market  X  by Chinese government [4]. Furthermore, Fig-ure 4 shows the heat map of the geographical distributions of DOM, unit price and transaction numbers in our data set. We can observe that the DOM distribution is relatively even, and the locations with high unit prices usually have a low number of transaction records, which is most prominent when comparing the upper left part of Figure 4 (b), (c).
Another market data set includes the profile information of 10,425 residential communities in Beijing, including build-ing number, greening rate, plot ratio, completion year, etc. Particularly, since the real estate market is usually influ-enced by public opinions, we also collected a large num-ber of real estate news from a variety of portal websites. By using a commercial API of named entity recognition [2], we finally obtained 740,434 news that can be linked to the communities in our data set. Detailed data descriptions are shown at the middle part of Table 1. Moreover, the data set also contains the neighboring facility information of each community, including Transport (e.g., bus stations), School, Hospital, Entertainment (e.g., cinemas), Shopping, Scenery and Unpleasant Facilities (e.g., factories). Some statistics are shown at the bottom part of Table 1, and Figure 3 (d) shows the heat map of the geographical distribution of resi-dential communities.
I n the cities of China, a house usually belongs to a specific residential community.
Other than the transaction data, we also collected two sets of large-scale geographical information from a major com-mercial online map service provider in China. These data sets contain two kinds of geographical information, namely Points Of Interest (POIs) and GPS requests of mobile users.
Specifically, there are totally 510,747 POIs of Beijing in our data set, which can help us further analyze the func-tionality and convenience of real estates. For example, more POIs generally indicate more convenient living environment, thus the density of POIs is an important factor in influencing people X  X  buying decisions. Figure 4 (e) shows the heat map of the geographical distributions of residential community and POI in our data set.

In another data set, we have the fine-grained daily GPS requesting records of mobile users in Beijing. To be specific, in our experiments, we filtered in total 59,638,947 GPS re-quests of mobile users from 18:00PM to 23:59PM of some workdays in Beijing. The heat map of the geographical dis-tribution of GPS request is shown in Figure 4 (f). Since most people would stay at home during this time period, we believe that this distribution could roughly reflect the population distribution of Beijing. These results can help us evaluate the occupancy rate and popularity of each resi-dential community.
In this section, we introduce the feature extraction from our data for DOM prediction. Specifically, we group all fea-tures into five categories, namely house pro le features , res-idential community features , geographical features , temporal features , and meta features . While some are simple transfor-mations of house/community attributes, others are implicit features that require the mining of raw data.
We obtain 11 house profile features such as area, price, and decoration, which describe the basic characteristics of the house. The details of these features are illustrated in Table 3. Particularly, the feature  X  X ree of Tax X  is a dummy variable indicating the seller has to pay sales tax or not. In China, if a residential house is resold by a seller within 5 years since the seller bought it, the seller has to pay sales tax. Otherwise, the seller will be free of sale tax. It is a pol-icy of Chinese government to discourage transactions of res-idential houses for investment purposes. All of house profile features in Table 3 are directly available from the raw data, except the feature X  X istorical DOM of Same Realtor X , which is used to represent the experience of realtors on DOM. The assumption here is that there exist hard-working or highly skilled realtors who are more likely able to sell a house in a short time, while a less-motivated or inexperienced realtor may spend a long time to find a buyer for the same house. For each transaction, this feature is calculated by averaging the DOM of houses sold by the same realtor.

What should be noted here is that, in the prediction model, we implement classic standardization for all numerical fea-tures. And we convert each categorical feature into N binary-valued features using one-hot encoding (i.e., dummy fea-ture), where N is the number of possible values that feature resen tation across a set of multiple related tasks. These works often select or learn a common set of shared features among the tasks [14, 5, 21]. Also, Obozinski and Argyriou et al. proposed joint feature learning for multi-task meth-ods [5, 23]. Argyriou et al. generalized the well-known Lasso from single task case to multiple task case. [14]. In addition, some researchers believe that the assumption that all tasks are related is too strong and may not hold in real world. Therefore, they proposed other task relationship structures, such as clustered structures [17], tree structures [20], and graph structures [19, 13].

Finally, multi-task learning methods have been used in various fields, such as education, disease control, and com-puter vision. For instance, Argyriou has exploited multi-task learning for predicting students X  exam scores. Bickel et al. has employed multi-task learning for HIV therapy screening [7] and Zhou et al. have proposed a multi-task formulation for predicting disease progression [31]. At last, Wang et al. have explored boosted multitask learning for web image and video search [29].
In this paper, we developed a comprehensive approach for measuring the liquidity of real estate markets. This ap-proach provides a critical capacity for predicting the DOM of a given property listing, and thus enhances the informa-tion transparency between sellers and buyers. Specifically, we first investigated various contextual features for identi-fying the key factors that can affect the sale of real estates. Then, we developed a multi-task learning based regression approach for DOM prediction, which can effectively learn district-aware models for different property listings by inte-grating extracted contextual features. Finally, we presented experimental results to demonstrate the performance of our method with a large amount of real-world real estate data, and designed a prototype system showing the practical use of the liquidity analysis for real estate markets.
