 The SoMeRA workshop targets cutting edge research from all fields of retrieval, recommendation, and browsing in so-cial media, as well as the analysis of user X  X  multifaceted traces therein. Submissions to the workshop cover a broad range of topics including multimedia retrieval and explo-ration, user-aware recommender systems, network analysis, event detection, and computational linguistics.

The amount of user-generated data (including content and contextual information of the users) has been spiraling dur-ing the past few years. Social media are fundamentally changing the way how we communicate. Nowadays, people create, share, and consume a huge number of multimedia material on the web and in particular on social platforms. The faster the growth of these corpora, the harder it gets for the individual to find the media documents which satisfy a particular information need. When it comes to multime-dia material in particular, the users might also exhibit an entertainment need, which may involve aspects of novelty, serendipity, familiarity, or popularity. However, current re-trieval, recommendation, and browsing techniques often fall short to deal with user-generated data of various kinds (au-dio, image, video, text, contextual, etc.), especially on a larger scale.

Satisfying the information-or entertainment need of users in social media data requires a comprehensive understand-ing of them, which can be gained to some extent by means of social media analysis and -mining [1, 3]. Corresponding user models which are built from this knowledge will im-prove retrieval and recommendation in social media , going far beyond text-based search which is still the most com-mon paradigm [4]. The gained knowledge also enables intel-ligently informed and enriched applications in various media domains [5, 2].
The purpose of the workshop is to bring together resear-chers of different domains who are involved in social media analysis, mining, and retrieval, for instance, experts in mul-timedia, recommender systems, and user modeling. This is reflected by the 19 submissions received that cover top-ics as diverse as multimedia retrieval and exploration, user-aware recommender systems, network analysis, event detec-tion, and computational linguistics in social media. Out of these, we selected the most outstanding works to be pre-sented at the workshop, which featured oral presentations of long papers and poster presentations of work in progress, indexed in the ACM Digital Library.
The workshop is supported by the European Union Sev-enth Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 through grant agreements no. 601166 (PHENICX) and no. 610591 (Giant-Steps), as well as by the Austrian Science Funds (FWF): P22856 and P25655.
