 In the last years Blog Search has been a new exciting task in Information Retrieval. The presence of user generated information with valuable opinions makes this field of huge interest. In this poster we use part of this information, the readers X  comments, to improve the quality of post snippets with the objective of enhancing the user access to the rele-vant posts in a result list. We propose a simple method for snippet generation based on sentence selection, using the comments to guide the selection process. We evaluated our approach with standard TREC methodology in the Blogs06 collection showing significant improvements up to 32% in terms of MAP over the baseline.

In the last years the rise of the blogs has induced a new branch within the field of Information Retrieval: blog search-ing. Indeed, a new TREC Track has been created in order to advance in this area, the Blog Track starting in 2006 [7] with a new standard data-set, the Blogs06 collection [5].
Basically in blog search we can distinguish the post-page, the individual web-page that contains a post; the post by itself, the text entry that has been written by the blog X  X  au-thor; and the comments, opinions of the readers about the post. For instance, in the opinion retrieval task in the TREC Blog Track the retrieval unit is the post-page. Although most of the information should be present in the post, sev-eral works have already presented results demonstrating the utility of the readers X  comments in the post-pages.
In [6] the authors demonstrated that by indexing the com-ments and the post, the recall of blog search is increased. It has to be remarked that recall is more important in blog than in web search because searchers are usually interested in all the recent posts about a specific topic. Although the precision values are basically maintained, highly discussed relevant post-pages seem to appear before in the rank. These results were obtained in a small corpus of 225MB where the 15% of the posts are commented. Another way of exploiting the comments information is in opinion finding. In [6] the comments are also used as indicators of discussion, estimat-4. The most relevant and novel sentences of the post are
In order to score the relevance of a sentence with respect to a piece of text we used the formulation of R ( s | q )asde-fined in [1], acting the piece of text as q . Cosine distance also as in [1] was used to filter redundant sentences. We have to remark that in no case comments X  text is added to the summaries, the comments are only used to guide the selection of important post X  X  sentences.

As baseline we created Generic Snippets ( GS ) without the use of comments information. To produce these snippets we followed exactly the same steps as presented before but the post text itself was used instead of the comments to guide the sentence selection process.

To test our approach, we had to automatically extract from the collection the posts and comments from the post-pages. This is indeed a messy task because this information is not standardly tagged in the collection. We applied a hybrid approach [2] with static templates for common blog-ging software platforms and a set of heuristics for the non commonly structured blogs.
In order to compare both approaches we decided to use the standard TREC methodology allowing in this way a large-scale evaluation without depending on expensive evaluators X  work. As we are dealing with blog snippets we decided to use the Blog Track approach evaluating the results under the topic relevance criteria. We used the Blogs06 collection [5] and topics 851-900 and 901-950 with  X  X itle only X .
We created two different indices: one with the generic snippets and another one with the comments-biased snip-pets. Higher retrieval effectiveness using the CBS index should indicate that the relevant documents are more ac-cessible using comments-biased snippets. We decided to use a high performance state-of-the-art retrieval model: BM25. The b value was trained for each index in queries 851  X  900 optimizing MAP , for the other BM25 parameters recom-mended values were used. Topics 901-950 were used for test.
With the objective of performing a fair evaluation we de-cided to evaluate both approaches only over the subset of the collection where both post and comments were detected by our extraction approach (we have to remark than ex-traction accuracy can be still improved). Therefore from 3 , 215 , 171 permalinks (post-pages) in the Blogs06 collection we selected 1 , 754 , 334 post-pages. Note than doing this, the effectiveness values are lower than in the whole collection because many relevant documents are not considered.
The evaluation results are summarized in Table 1. Our approach ( CBS ) achieves significant improvements for every setting and measure over the generic snippets ( GS ). In the test topics the improvement in terms of MAP, that was the measure optimized in training, achieved the 32%.

We also tested, in an additional experiment, the combina-tion of both the post and comments to guide the sentence extraction process in the snippet generation. The effective-ness of this approach was only slightly better than using only the post ( GS ). This is explained because most of the
