 Once referred to by the Supreme Court as the  X  X etaphysics X  of law, many parts of copyright po licy are historically confusing. Therefore, it isn X  X  surprising that in communities where amateur content creators work within a legal gray area, copyright is a frequent topic of conversation. Here, people with often little knowledge of the letter of the law are asking and answering complex legal questions in the c ontext of their creative activities. Working from a content analysis of public forum conversations in eight different online communities, we have examined these questions and answers more closely. By studying these interactions, what can we learn about how people engage with the law and how non-expert advice a ffects behavior and knowledge? K.4.1 [Computers and Society]: Public Policy Issues ---Intellectual property rights Legal Aspects Copyright; Creativity; Expertise; Intellectual property; Law; Online communities; Policy; Social Q&amp;A; User-generated content The phrase  X  X  am not a lawyer X  is so common in online discussions that it comes with a commonly used acronym: IANAL. Typically followed by a  X  X ut... X  this disclaimer goes hand-in-hand with frequently offered amateur legal advice in a variety of contexts all over the Internet. One common topic is that of copyright, which though once mos tly relevant to professional artists and big corporations now touches ordinary Internet users on a daily basis. Thanks to the ease of digitization and wide dissemination of content, anyone with an Internet connection and a  X  X hare X  button is engaging with copyright. However, more people engaging with this aspect of the law does not make it less complex. On the contrary, technological advances only exacerbate existing confusions in the law. Consider, for example, how easy and common it is now to appropriate existing copyrighted work X  X rom popular Y ouTube remix videos to viral image memes to Star Trek fan fiction. Whereas the average Internet user might know that it is illegal to download a copyrighted song, whether that song can be used as part of a remix is a more difficult question. In a seminal case about remix prior to widespread use of the Internet, the Supreme Court in Campbell vs. Acuff-Rose (1992) referred to issues of appropriation as the  X  X ost troubles ome X  part of all of copyright law. Most online sites where people share creative work include some way for users to interact beyond simply commenting on one another X  X  work. In these spaces where intellectual property matters come up frequently, much of this discussion focuses on questions and answers. In the same online communities where users are posting digital art, fan fiction, remix videos, and music remix, they are asking each other questions like  X  X ow does the law apply to my work? X ,  X  X s this illegal? X , and  X  X hy did I get in trouble? X  This is a rich example of an online question-and-answer space in which non-experts are relying on one another X  X  (often imperfect) knowledge and advice in order to make decisions. As part of a broader study on copyright knowledge and norms in online creative communities [6,7], we conducted a content analysis of public forum conversa tions about copyright in eight different online communities. In looking specifically at how users are asking and answering questions, we have begun to see some patterns in social question asking (Q&amp;A) taking place among strangers with a shared creative interest. Our prior work began with the problem of gray areas in the parts of copyright law relevant to on line content creators. Judging from previous research, including studi es of documentary filmmakers [10], remix video creators [2], and knitters [9], we expected to see misunderstandings of the law am ong remixers. However, a more surprising finding was how simila r their ideas were. Focusing on fair use, 1 the legal doctrine that allows for some uses of copyrighted content, we found both nuances of understanding and patterns of misconceptions [6]. Many of these patterns seemed tied to social norms, which suggests that they form within the community itself. This includes not only misconceptions but also social constructions of the law. One hypothesis is that these constructions could be formed by learning within the community, including information seeking behavior. Though there is little work in the area of Q&amp;A specifically related to intellectual property, Humphries X  study of Ravelry, an online community of knitters, examined copyright discussions in the site X  X  online forum [9]. The conclusion was that the community seemed to have very little consensus over what constituted legal or ethical behavior. As the author pointed out, if a simple request for information resulted in a thread with over 80 posts that culminates in a suggestion that the poster consult an attorney, there is likely a problem with both legal literacy and uncertainty. Humphries also suggested that these Q&amp;A sessions result only in frustration rather than encouraging people to learn more. Of course, it is not unusual for people to seek answers to their questions online, and from a number of different sources. Research in this area has explored formal Q&amp;A sites such as Quora and Yahoo! Answers [1,13] where most of the interaction is between strangers, as well as the use of personal social networks [8,12] (such as Twitte r and Facebook) for information-seeking. We know some reasons why someone might choose to ask a question on Facebook, for ex ample, as opposed to seeking out a specific expert, such as personal context and trust [12]. Choi et al. have proposed four models of Q&amp;A sites: community, collaborative, expert-based, and social [4]. One might consider an online affinity space, in which people come together because of a shared interest or common activity (rather than simply Q&amp;A) to be somewhere in between a social and community model. In these spaces, when someone asks a question and the answer comes from a stranger, they know something about them X  X hat they are likely also an artist, or a writer, or a knitter. They share a common experience, and common problems related to the question X  X n this case, the struggle to understand the boundaries of copyright law in the context of their creative work. Trust and context are still benefits, but information seekers also have to make decisions about authority and expertise X  X hich we know from credibility research can be difficult to judge [5,13]. Additionally, the legal context makes the questions potentially high risk X  X ould trusting a wrong answer lead to legal trouble? In this way, the environment is simila r to health information seeking, where source credibility is an im portant factor in Q&amp;A [5]. As part of a broader research project [7], we are focusing on creative activities often burdened with unclear copyright issues X  i.e., remix and appropriation. Ther efore, our data set comes from online communities for which creative appropriation is common. We identified eight popular online communities representing four common remix media types: art, music, writing, and video (see Table 1). Each site features user-generated content and has a public forum with posts primarily in English. Our data set comes from public (publicly viewable to anyone on the web without account creation) forum posts scraped from these websites in the spring of 2013 [7]. We used an inter-rater reliability measure to validate a ke ywords used to identify posts about copyright from this set of posts, and then created a random sample with a maximum of 50 posts from each site. In sum, we began with a set of millions of forum posts across these eight different online communities, narrowed down this data set to posts that were likely about copyright, and then narrowed this down to a tractable number of posts about copyright based on a random sample (see Table 1). The final data set consists of 339 posts. Table 1 also shows an es timate of the percentage of copyright-related posts in each forum generally, based on analysis of an additional random sample. Though these numbers might seem small, for DeviantArt X  X  15 million posts, for example, three percent still represents hundreds of thousands of conversations. For data analysis, we looked to grounded theory, which provided us with a systematic process for analysis while maintaining flexibility to fit this unique data [2]. We began with inductive, open coding, and coded the data for emergent phenomena. Two independent coders met to peri odically discuss codes and then synthesized them into a final set. One coder was the first author, who is a law school graduate and copyright expert. Once the categories were finalized we code d the data again and used an overlapping set of 10% to calculate inter-rater reliability with a percent agreement of 94% and Cohen X  X  Kappa of .77 [6]. In our analysis of the resulting data set, we grouped our codes into eight higher level categories: type of post, legal concepts, policies and enforcement, ethics, attitude s, media, problems, and Q&amp;A. For more detail on methods and additional findings, see [7]. For the current discussion, we are focusing on our initial findings about Q&amp;A based on this analysis. The general types of copyri ght-related conversations we identified in this data set were : Q&amp;A, requests for action, policy commentary, complaints, discussion of a specific case, and other (veering off-topic to copyright). In categorizing the posts by type, we found that the most common by far was Q&amp;A. In the two largest sites that we studied , DeviantArt and YouTube, Q&amp;A posts made up more than half of those posts in our data set. Essentially, the majority of th e copyright-related conversation taking places in these communities stems from someone asking a question. We also categorized the most common questions that posters asked: A great many of these questions boil down to requests for amateur legal advice.  X  X s this okay? X  is the most common, with a poster expressing concern about some creative activity and whether it might be illegal or against site po licies. What complicates matters is that rarely are there black-and-white answers to these questions, but instead they can be legally complex. For example, one poster on Overclocked, a music remix site , asked whether it is legal to use extracted vocals in a remix of a commercial song. Another asked if it was legal to use chiptune effects on an album intended to generate revenue for a religious entity. The answers to both of these questions depend upon a fairly complex fair use analysis. Nearly every question in our data set was answered by at least one person X  X ometimes by several people, with conflicting answers. The question above about chip tunes and religious entities generated four pages of discu ssion, including one complex (and fairly accurate) fair use analysis, some blatant misinformation, and advice to consult a lawyer. One later commentator pointed out the humor in the conflicting advice, writing that the comments either boiled down to  X  X on X  X  do it or you could go to jail X  or  X  X ome on, just do it, nobody will notice. X  Another poster pointed out that the Internet is a poor substitute for legal advice, and yet another praised the thread for helping them to learn about copyright law. Though that particular thread benefited from participants who had some understanding of law, ma ny do not. Some answers to questions express basic misunders tandings about copyright, such as telling a poster that they have to register with the copyright office in order to have a copyright in their work, that any image found online is public domain and thus available to use, or that writing  X  X o copyright infringement X  as a disclaimer carries legal weight (all of which are incorrect ). Misinformation also comes in the form of too strictly construing copyright law. One respondent incorrectly stated that remixing anything without a license in writing constitutes criminal activity. When one YouTube poster questioned whether their vide o taken down for a copyright violation may have been fair us e, one commenter answered that there is no such thing as fair use. In our data set, nearly a quarter of the posts contained some incorrect legal information. Even when incorrect, more often than not, answers are presented as fact rather than opinion. We coded for degree of confidence, and absolute confidence was far more common than  X  X  X  X  not sure, but... X  or IANAL disclaimers. However, it was also rare for answers to provide either citations or indications of expertise (occurring in less than 5% of the posts). Occasionally a poster would link to an external resource, such as a Wikipedia page or even to the actual legal code, but this was unusual. Even more unusual X  X een only once in our entire data set X  X id someone express personal expertise. Here , we saw the opposite of IANAL:  X  X  am a lawyer, but this is not legal advice X  (a necessary disclaimer for attorneys to avoid creating attorney-client relationships strangers on the Internet). Based on this data alone it is difficult to speculate about the outcomes of questions being answ ered. However, we can infer that posters take the advice offered at least some of the time. In cases of incorrect information, th is could be potentially troubling. Though interestingly, what we see less often is advice that might get the original poster into legal trouble (telling them that something is okay when it isn X  X ). Instead, the more common problem would be advice that might stifle the poster X  X  creativity (telling them that something isn X  X  okay when it might be). In legal terms, not doing something that you should be able to do because you fear legal consequences is a chilling effect . Erroneously telling a creator that their work is illegal could result in that creator choosing not to share their work. Throughout the entirety of our data set, an overarching theme was that of incomplete information: information seeking, expressions of confusion about the law, misl eading or contradictory answers. However, also among incorrect information is correct information, and the occasional nuanced discussion that goes beyond typical copyright knowledge . Within our data, we saw examples of posters going out of th eir way to answer questions in their communities. These individuals tended to have more legal knowledge than those providing quick, one-off answers. Another side effect of these discussions is that community members sometimes do legal research and learn about things that they wouldn X  X  otherwise. Copyright Q&amp;A sessions therefore are in a position to both contribute to knowledge and spread misinformation. As in other poten tially high-stakes contexts such as health information, this position can be precarious. Social media Q&amp;A research has been exploring important issues of how people seek informati on online from varying sources. Much of this research has focused on either answering questions from strangers (e.g., Yahoo! Answers) or from their social networks (e.g., Facebook). The domain of copyright conversations among online content creators offers some potentially unique questions and problems in this space. Here we see information-seeking behavior towards people who are neither trusted friends nor strangers nor experts X  X ut rather, people with a shared experience. However, similar to health information seeking behavior, legal advice could have potentially high stakes. Our work so far begins to describe these communities as a Q&amp;A space, examining the type of questions being asked, and the answers provided. We see that questions are almost always answered with a high degree of c onfidence and with few citations. This coupled with a high degree of incorrect information is potentially problematic. Future work includes an examination of how judgments of expertise are actually happening within these communities. How are question askers deciding w hom to trust? What are the outcomes of these interactions? Are there times when Q&amp;A is more harmful than helpful if mi sinformation is disseminated? Are the interactions more similar to those with expert-strangers or non-expert-friends? Moreover, there is a potential design space here. How can the designers of these communities better support more productive and useful conversations about c opyright? All of this conversation is taking place despite none of these communities providing dedicated spaces for legal discussions or Q&amp;A. Encouraging better understandings of copyright could both discourage chilling effects on creativity and help mitigate the air of legal uncertainty in these communities.
