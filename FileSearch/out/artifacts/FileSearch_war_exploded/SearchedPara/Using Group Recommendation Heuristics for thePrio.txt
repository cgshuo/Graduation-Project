 Group recommendation heuristics have been successfully applied in different domains such as Interactive Television and e-Tourism. Our work focuses on the improvement of requirements prioritiza-tion techniques on the basis of group recommendation technolo-gies. First, we analyse the impact of preference visibility on the outcome of the requirements prioritization process. In this context we evaluate the resulting software quality and the satisfaction of stakeholders with the requirements prioritization. Second, we anal-yse standard group recommendation heuristics on a dataset origi-nated from a study conducted at our university. Finally, we propose new heuristics to improve the prediction quality and conclude with an evaluation of the different recommendation heuristics.

Limited resources in software projects make it necessary to prior-itize requirements [7] [13], which eases the planning of subsequent software releases. Furthermore, requirements prioritization sup-ports the conflict resolution between stakeholder preferences. Be-cause of the complexity of the requirements prioritization task, this process requires collaborative work contributed by multiple stake-holders. Systematic requirements prioritization is crucial for the successful completion of a software project since then the avail-able resources are used only for the most relevant requirements. However, establishing consensus about the prioritization of require-ments is a challenging task. There are many effects which must be considered, such as cognitive dissonance reduction [5], group po-larization [14], and the primacy effect [3]. To simplify this task, tools can recommend prioritizations of requirements as a function of the team preferences. However, if such a prediction of a group decision is only based on the initial preferences of the stakeholders, the prediction quality will be low [11]. A challenge in this context is changing group member preferences during the decision-making process [11]. Another challenge is the primacy effect in prefer-ence elicitation [3]: the outcome of this phase will depend on the sequence in which preferences have been inserted. The psycho-logical literature shows that consensus about topics formed early in discussions is cognitive resistant to changes. Additional infor-mation added later will be assimilated to already chosen consensus and it is very unlikely that another option is chosen [8]. This phe-nomenon can be explained by the assimilating effect based on the dissonance theory [5] which states that individuals are motivated to reduce psychological incongruity or discrepancy that may arise by adding new information to a present perception [2]. The re-sult is that stakeholders will perceive already selected options more attractive than new options [2] and this leads to a bias of group preferences depending on the order of the incoming preferences. Unfortunately, this effect is increased if there is a high group iden-tity, because the fear of exclusion from the group is higher [8]. To reduce this effect, a brainstorming phase in which stakeholders become aware of their own preferences should be established. To raise the willingness of stakeholders to report their honest concerns, this brainstorming phase should be implemented in an anonymous fashion [6]. In a software environment, for example, this can be done if requirements can be added without authentication. First re-lated study results will be presented in the following Sections. An important issue in the group prioritization process is the factor of fairness . The degree of perceived fairness influences the will-ingness of group members to accept compromises in the resolution of disputes and their trust in other stakeholders [8]. Especially in environments with a high amount of requirements it is necessary to provide tool support in the prioritization process to achieve a max-imum degree of perceived fairness. One way to provide such a tool support is to present recommendations of reasonable requirements prioritizations to decision makers.
 In our work we investigate different recommendation heuristics with respect to the achieved prediction quality . We also show how anonymity (preferences are not connected to stakeholder names)

The major contributions reported in this paper are to show that anonymity in decision making influences the quality of the prioritization and to present new heuristics for group recommendations with better prediction quality.
 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide an overview of the IntelliReq decision support environment developed at the Graz University of Technology. In Section 3 we show the impact of the factors anonymity , consensus , and decision diversity on the quality of the prioritization , the stakeholder satis-faction with the prioritization, and the quality of software artefacts. Section 4 covers standard recommendation heuristics including our new proposed heuristics. Section 5 gives an overview of the empir-ical study conducted at our university. In Section 6 we conclude the paper with an outlook on future work.
IntelliReq is a group decision support tool developed at our uni-versity. One feature is the group based requirements negotiation support which will be discussed in detail in the remainder of this paper. The requirements prioritization process consists of three dif-ferent phases (see Figure 1). The first phase is called construction in which the individual stakeholder preferences are collected. The second phase is denoted as consensus and is used to discuss and adapt stakeholder preferences. In the third phase ( decision ), the project manager finalizes the group prioritization and can attach ex-planations for decisions. This explanation can be seen by all group members. To evaluate the impact of anonymized preference elic-itation (it is hidden which stakeholder defined which preference), IntelliReq supports two different modes of interaction. One mode uses anonymised preference elicitation, in the other mode user pref-erences are visible.
Within the scope of our study we evaluated the impact of the fac-tors anonymity , consensus , and decision diversity (the standard de-viation between the final prioritization results of different require-ments) on the output (software) quality and the satisfaction of the stakeholders with the prioritization. The empirical study has been conducted within the course Object-oriented Analysis and Design (N=39 software teams of size 5-6; 15.45% female, 84.55% male) and showed that there are impacts as can be seen in Figure 2. These impacts can be summarized as follows: Figure 2: The result of the IntelliReq study (N=39 software teams of size 5-6) as an impact graph. Starting with Anony-mous Preference Elicitation each following phase is influenced according to the arrows.
We hypothesise that the effects described in the previous section could be enhanced by the use of group recommendation heuris-tics. Consequently, we want to evaluate the best heuristics to pre-dict stakeholder voting behaviour in the requirements prioritization process. In the afore mentioned study conducted at our university we collected a dataset of approximately 10.000 decisions including the preferences of stakeholder and the resulting prioritizations of the software teams. With this dataset we evaluated different group recommendation heuristics [9] and compared predicted with real decisions taken by the participants of our study. For the evalua-tion we used the precision metric according to Formula 1. The fol-lowing subsections describe the different applied heuristics that are based on following parameters: median m , standard deviation sd , heuristic h and requirement r . precision ( h ) = # correctly predicted group pref erences ( h ) This heuristic determines (recommends) for each requirement r the priority value p with the lowest distance to the other elements in the set of distinct user preferences (PREF) where p  X  P REF . This criteria is formalized in a corresponding evaluation function (see Formula 2 and Table 1).
 This heuristic recommends a priority value which represents the majority of stakeholder votes related to a specific requirement. An example for the recommendation result of the majority heuristic is given in Table 2.
 This heuristic determines the average value (see Formula 3) and round the result (see Formula 4) of the declared stakeholder prefer-ences for each requirement. This value is taken as a recommenda-tion of the priority value for the corresponding requirement.
P riority ( r ) = The random heuristic has been integrated only for evaluation pur-poses. This heuristic has -as expected -the weakest performance, which can be seen in the Study Result Section.
 Inspired by a survey of the voting behaviour of six-person juries conducted by the University of Chicago [12], we implemented a new heuristic called Median Based Heuristic (see Formula 5). In the original study [12], jury members were asked about their initial preferences for the penalty. These initial punishment preferences were compared with the final decision after group deliberating. The finding was that there was a severity shift for the high-punishment cases, and a leniency shift for the low-punishment cases [12]. Such choice shifts are explained by the Group Polarization Theory [14]. In a similar fashion, our algorithm calculates the recommendations depending on the median of the initial preferences. In our study, the preferences are distributed on a six point scale. In this context, the algorithm has three possible states (see also Formula 5):
P riority ( r, m ) = For a further improvement of the prediction quality we introduced a combination of different heuristics. For each recommendation task the algorithm calculates the Majority (MAJ), the Least Distance (LDIS), and the Median Based (MDB) heuristic. If two heuristics recommend the same result, this result is the final recommendation. If there are three different recommendations, the Median Based heuristic is the final recommendation. The heuristic is shown in Formula 6.
 P riority ( r, m ) = The hypothesis for this heuristic is that the best heuristic depends on the degree of conformity of the initial preferences. For example, if the group has a high degree of consensus, the Least Distance heuristic will perform best. If there is a high dissent, the Average heuristic will perform better. The highest standard deviation in our dataset is 2.50. We divided the dataset into three subsets. Each subset has the same standard deviation range ( 2 . 50 3  X  0 . 84 ). Next we tested the heuristics mentioned in this paper on the dataset to find the heuristic which performs best on each subset (see Table 3). For this evaluation we used the complete dataset of the Consensus and Decision phases (see Figure 1) which included the anonymous and the non-anonymous setting. The combination of the different heuristics can be found in Formula 7.

P riority ( sd, r, m ) =
Thereafter we generated a function which uses the heuristic de-pending on the standard deviation and the results of Table 3.
An overview of the study results can be found in Table 4. though the Median Based heuristic is outperformed by the Least Distance (see Table 4), the Median Based performs better in an environment with visible preferences. In the study conducted at the University of Chicago [12], on which this heuristic is based on, the same observation was made in decision making processes where group member preferences are visible. The Standard Devi-ation heuristic is out of competition as this heuristic is defined for this specific dataset. Future studies with new datasets will show whether this combination of different heuristics will have an im-proved prediction quality. When comparing the prediction quality of the remaining heuristics, the Ensemble heuristic performs best. Table 4: Comparison of heuristics of the Consensus and the Decision phase (best results are marked bold).
The heuristics discussed in this paper are basic group recommen-dation heuristics [9]. Our initial analysis shows the applicability of these heuristics in terms of prediction quality. As part of our future work we want to investigate the positive effect of recom-mendations on the dimensions decision diversity , satisfaction with requirements prioritization , and the software quality resulting from the requirements prioritization process. In addition, we want to conduct an in-depth evaluation of the user acceptance of the deter-mined group recommendations -up to now only the majority voting based recommendations has been analysed [4].
 Furthermore, we want to analyse whether if the Standard Deviation heuristic (as described in Formula 7) has the same prediction qual-ity on other data sets . We also want to use this heuristic for group recommendation in our upcoming IntelliReq user studies. An im-portant task for future work is the analysis of preference reversal [2] in requirements engineering and the impact on the prioritiza-tion quality and the stakeholders X  satisfaction with the prioritiza-tion. In this context we want to develop new methods to improve stakeholder satisfaction.
 Another topic of interest is the different interpretation of prefer-ences. Are the group members arguing of the same topic? Does everybody has the same understanding of a given term? It has been
Due to the limited space only the results without differentiation between visible and non-visible preferences are shown. shown that team members often enter a decision process from dif-ferent viewpoints. Therefore it is necessary to find a consensus on the interpretation of shared information. This is especially impor-tant as the interpretation of issues has an massive impact on the decision making and is therefore considered as crucial [10]. [1] R. B. Cialdini. The science of persuasion.
