 Fierce market competition nowadays forces en terprises integrating internal or external processes. The advancement of communication technologies and network computing Since it is difficult for enterprises to produce complete products or services in isolated facilities, and with the support of existing advanced network and communication business processes take place in an open distributed environment of heterogeneous and autonomous nodes. external corporate business processes. It can be categorized into two kinds according (EAI) that enables companies to achieve integration of internal systems; and the other type is BPM for business-to-business integration (B2Bi) which focuses on how supporting them can be seamlessly integrated. business processes, including graphical process modeling tools, middleware technologies such as CORBA, integration brokers, business process management systems and B2B servers. However, until recently the investment required by organizations to integrate the IT systems both inside their organization and across the firewall has been very high. This is mainly because the different proprietary interfaces and data format used by each application.
 and data formats with low-cost, ubiquitously supported standards for interfaces and data that work as well as across the firewall as within it [1, 2]. The freely flow of applications and services can interact and negotiate among themselves without having a specialist to key in data and commands over a browser interface. The web services technologies can integrating disparate heterogeneous business systems (B2Bi). related works; Section 3 discusses the implementing steps of deploying web services based BPM system; Section 4 proposed the two-level selection approach based on the six criteria defined and discusses the detailer implement process according to three of the criterion; In section 5 a simple example of web services application is given. And concluding remarks are given in the last section. BPM is dealing with the reality that business processes are complex, dynamic and intertwined throughout an organization or beyond the firewall to its partners and customers. By automating and streamlining the unique and routine processes that creates an environment where processes can be leveraged for strategic value. for making business processes accessible within or across enterprises boundaries. composing individual Web services to represent complex processes, which can even span multiple organizations. META Group describes the latest move to integrated application portfolios into service-orientated architectures and Web services. 
The relationship between business process and web services is very important, but is not often explained very clearly. In [4], the authors have discussed the relationship between web services and business processes from a specific viewpoint. Roughly speaking, web services can be used as implementations of activities within a business process, and that business processes in turn can be externalized as web services. The business processes that can be built based on this simple observation range from simplex to complex. More generally, we can view the relationship from the following several aspects. 
The services don X  X  define what process you can implement; rather, the business processes define what services you used. 
A business process description (or flow model) can be published as a web service, it becomes impossible to distinguish whet her an invoked service is an atomic service or a service composed with business process. 
The interaction between services is what creates the implementation of the business processes. Multiple services in a business process can come from different organizations. 
Individual services can be composed into a process flow that itself can be described as a service using the same web services standards. 
A business comprised of hundreds of discrete web services isn't particularly efficient. What is more interesting is the composition of multiple web services into a coherent business process that meets business requirements. In order for this composition to occur, a way of composing atomic, fine-grained web services into coarse-grained business services is needed. Process_2 in an enterprise is implemented by a web service, which in fact is another process Process_2 itself can also be treated as a web service that could be invoked by a third process (Process_3). 
Driven by web services, BPM offers a prime opportunity to create new types of unleashing the power of BPM. They enhance its benefits by providing lower integration costs, accelerating the time to market, through shorter implementation cycles, and increasing the ability to adapt. behavioral issues) and hard elements (such as technology, tools, and techniques), web services can alleviate some of the complexities [3]. integration, which enables the composition of pre-defined canonical web services for approaches. Wombacher and Mahleko have highlighted the challenges that inhibit the might be overcome [10]. Estrem examines economic, technical, and organizational advanced information architectures based on web services to support the complex stakeholders in virtual enterprise environments [6]. In [7] the authors propose a methodology which provides a framework for identifying web services from business processes and principles in web services design which covers both functional provision, billing, pricing and metering. And in [11], the authors propose a technique principles of good web services design. The principles are based on 15 years of software technology evolution, combined with practical experience from today's deployed web services applications. And it also describes effective web services architecture for business process management. Based on the study of e-business standards and research of relevant literatures, Chen has identified several factors that affect the adoption and diffusion of web services for e-business standards [9]. Building BPM solutions that leverage web services is the result of methodical identifies and overcomes the challenges, companies can reap the reward. partitioned into four sequential steps, which are outlined as follows. 3.1 Defining Strategic Objectives Business processes are collections of activities with common objectives and human activities are primarily driven by goals. A clear understanding of organization goals is deployment of BPM project, business process objectives must be clearly determined which will contribute much to the efficient description of the business operations. It is the fundamental step. analyzing internal and external complaints, or monitoring competitors. Following the elicitation, goals should be decomposed and the relationships among subgoals should be clearly outlined. 3.2 Business Process Modeling and Implementation Description executions of activities are under the control of business rules. A business process can be formalized as may refer to [5]. the operations and performers. Fig. 2. is a simplified process about purchase request. Rectangles represent process activities, the solid line and dotted line represents control flow and information flow in the process respectively. above process named as totalSupplyFlow. In this example, the flow model imposes provider type. 3.3 Role Allocation each of the activities should be identified. In other words, each of the activities should be allocated to specific role s that implementing it, i.e. human beings, software deploying web service enabled BPM projects. In this stage, the providers of each web services that responsible for the execution of the business process activities should be defined; it is the most critical step to deploy web services based BPM systems. weak-deduction symbol  X   X , and BA means that if A is true, then B should be true. other factors.
 established, specific web services should be selected from multiple similar web services provided by different providers, which is an optimal problem involving various parameters and will be detailed in the next section. 3.4 Business Process Execution Executing the business process modeled in stage 2, during the operations, related execute the tasks are banded and invoked. Fig.4. is a simple SOAP request to a identify verification services for customer identity affirmation. Before deployment the web based BPM systems, companies need to understand the benefits and potential impacts of web services on the enterprise, and the selection of web services is a pivotal part of it that will be more difficult than traditional product services compositions problems if needed . Some researchers have explored the selection of web services from different aspects. Benatallah and his fellows have discussed the selection of web services for composition based on the criteria of with supplier selection problem in supply chain management domain, from which we can draw some ideas to construct the sel ection method. However, since web services different from the common products and its web based characteristics makes its different selection criteria. 4.1 Selection Criteria Definition In this paper, we adopt a two-level web services selection method that based upon six selection criteria. criteria means: Function: The functions of the web services provided, it can be measured with satisfaction degree of the companies, [0,1] x , on Satisfacti  X  = x Degree ; Price: Purchase price of the web services, it is a fix value for specific web services; Location: The physical address of the web services provider, which impacts the service transport time and represented as network latency. Since the data flow amount on the network is fluky so the latency time could not be looked as a fixed function of the physical distance, it can reference the average transport time for simplicity. may give some support for selecting multiple elementary web services from different providers or selecting one composition web services from an intermediary; process the requested transactions within ex pected time. It relies on the software and hardware configurations of the service-side server and even the network transport ratio of successful delivery times to all the invocations times. Reputation: It is the trustiness of that the enterprises feel about the services. It can be got from the services X  past users X  evaluations, simply for example, the average of all the evaluations. specific requirements, for example, for time-sensitive business, the execution time (location) and reliability will be granted relatively higher values. 4.2 Selection Approach services selection. (1) Function search: Take a rough-grain search of the UDDI service registry center functions that the web services must full fill the enterprise X  X  business function requirements. multiple services from different providers that need a further filter. In this step, a fine-priorities that the enterprise defined. One by one with the criteria constraints eventually get the right web services until the criteria with lowest priority constraints selection is performed. business process management task, more complex computation will be need in relatively detailer illustration of the above approach. compositions). Maximizing the number of services provided by the same provider will decrease the interactions between different providers and the data exchange between host where the services resident. Based on this fact, we define the following selection guidelines concerning the location factor: will avoid data exchange between services of heterogeneous locations; which will implement the local invocation and reduce the data exchange; selection to discuss the detail selection procedure. services (services compositions), selection process can be carried ou t according to the following approach. service providers, which form the corresponding sets, i WSP (i=1,..,n); process, select the ch eapest provider from 1 WSP according to the to tal execution cost, which may including the actual execution cost, costs brought by the network transport subsequencing services providers will be determined according to the execution costs and providers X  location. In this paper, we define the priority of location is higher than compare process accord ing to the three guidelines described above to select the determine the final service provider i WSP . services providers will be selected and scheduled to implement the distributed business process management. However, as for different industries will have different business requirements, which leads to the industries will value the criterion differently and assign different priorities to each of them . Accordingly, it will lead to different selection guidelines and approaches. For a large manufacturing company, the requirements for electronic payment have been widely used in many areas, such as ERP, SCM and CRM. However, credit card authorization remains a problem that baffli ng the enterprises. B ecause the credit card companies wouldn X  X  going to distribute authority for credit card authorization among of credit card authorization involves many te chnical and other factors that are difficult necessary to do business, the most promising solution, i.e. web services are adopted to resolve this problem. party web service for credit card authentication, as shown with Fig.5. operations are carried out to verify cust omer information, which belongs to the traditional business processes executions. card authentication) by doing a lookup in the private UDDI registry. authentication has no longer been provided by Enterprise B. customer's credit card; 
Enterprise B's CCAS receives the Web service request and sends the credit card validation response back to enterprise A. And some subsequent operations are carried out to complete the whole order entry process. CRM and SCM systems caused by the new order entry can also be implemented as internal web services, which was not presented in the figure. In this paper we have discussed the relationships between web services and BPM and some relevant problems in implementation. Web services and business process management both promise to impact profoundly the way that organizations use the BPM and web services help re-establish enterprises' control over IT. New innovations to quickly, easily and even invisibly use technology resources of all kinds to support their requirements. However, much works need to do to deployment a successful web capabilities, must also be addressed.
