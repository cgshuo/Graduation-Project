 SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 125 In this paper, we provide a summ ary of the WEBKDD 2002 workshop , who se theme was  X  X eb Mining for Usage Patterns and Profiles X . This workshop was held in con jun ction with the ACM SIGKDD Internation al Con ference on Kno wledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD -2002 ).
 Web mining, profiling, person alization , click -stream analysis, usage patterns. Thou gh  X  X  -comm erce X  may no t be a popu lar word these days, Web u sage has con tinu ed to grow, bo th in terms of the size of the user base, and the rate of usage. In add ition , its low cost and flexibilit y is leading to increasing adop tion b y organization s as the preferred customer con tact chann el. On the user side, as usage experience a nd soph istication grows, there is an increasin g demand for Web sites to b e respon sive to the needs of users. The truth o f this s tatement is s uppo rted b y the imm ense popu larity of sites that offer person alization , e.g. Yahoo ( www .yahoo .com )  X  which o ffers the MyYahoo service, Amazon ( www .amazon .com )  X  which o ffers dynamic person alization , and Yod lee ( www .yod lee.com )  X  which o ffers person alization o f password protected sites.
 Kno wledge a bou t the user is fund amental for the e stablishment of effective person alized services. Web mining for Usag e Patterns a nd User Profiles is the a pp lication o f web mining techn iqu es to acqu ire this kno wledge. Typical con cerns in e -comm erce includ e improved cross -sells, up -sells, person alized ads, targeted assortments, improved con version rates, and measurements of the effect iveness of action s. WEBKDD 2002 was the fou rth in a series of very succe ssful workshop s on kno wledge discovery from Web d ata. The stron g interest for KDD in the Web h as been manifested since the first WEBKDD workshop in 1999 . The WEBKDD '02 workshop brou gh t t ogether practiti on ers on web -comm erce, po rtals and app lication service providers (ASPs), decision -makers in non -comm ercial institution s that exploit web techno logies to op timize their services, techno logy providers and d ata mining researchers to foster the e xchange of ideas and the dissemination o f emerging solution s on u ser and u sage mod eling for web -based app lication s. In respon se to call for papers, WEBKDD 2002 rece ived 23 con tribu tion s. We wou ld like to thank the a utho rs for their efforts, since it i s their sub mission s that laid the found ation s of a stron g techn ical program. Each sub mission was reviewed b y at l east three program comm ittee members. Ten sub mission s were selected for presentation . The main selection criterion was the qu ality of the idea. We wou ld like to thank the members of the program comm ittee for taking time to p rovide insightful critiqu e, and thu s ensuring the high qu ality of the workshop . The KDD comm un ity respond ed very enthu siastically to the WEBKDD 2002 workshop , and ab ou t 50 p eop le a ttend ed the workshop , which b rou ght together e -comm erce practiti on ers, too l vendo rs and d ata mining researchers. The paper presentation was divided into fou r session s. Described b elow are the c on tents of eac h o f the session s. This s ession focused on ho w w eb mining can add ress on e of the fund amental issues of Web u sage, namely ho w to classify the user popu lation into variou s categories, so that the e xperience ca n b e made better. In add ition , furth er classification b ased on  X  X sage patterns X  can h elp gauging the  X  X ood  X  of the user. The two p apers in this s ession p resented n ew ideas in this direction .
 In their paper titl ed  X  X ntelligent Discovery and Ana lysis of Web User Traffic Compo sition  X  , Chi, Rosi en, Heer sho w ho w Web Usage Mining enables new und erstand ing of user goals on the Web. This und erstand ing has broad app lication s, and tradition al mining techn iqu es s uch as association rules have been u sed in bu siness app lication s. They have develop ed an au tomated method to d irectly infer the major group ings of user traffic on a Web site [Heer01 ]. They do this by utili zing multiple data features in a clustering analysis. They have performed an extensive, systematic SIGKDD Exploration s.

This paper describes the further develop ment of this work into a prototype service ca lled LumberJack, a pu sh -bu tton analysis s ystem that is bo th more a utoma ted and acc urate than p ast systems.
 Shah, Joshi, Wurman, in their paper titl ed  X  X ining for Bidd ing Strategies on e -Bay X  , illustrated ho w data mining can b e used to better und erstand auction s  X  a fast emerging app roach to con sumer e -comm erce. Milli on s of pe op le participate in on line auction s on websites s uch as eBay. The data a vailable in these pub lic markets offer interesting oppo rtun ities to stud y Internet auction s. This paper explored techn iqu es for identifying comm on bidd ing patterns on eBay using data f rom eBay videogame con sole a uction s. The a nalysis reveals that t here a re ce rtain bidd ing behaviors that app ear frequ ently in the data, some of which h ave been p reviou sly identified and o thers which are new. The a utho rs propo sed n ew attribu tes of bidd ing en gagements and rules for classifying strategies. In add ition , they suggest econo mic motivation s that might lead to the identified b ehaviors. This s ession add ressed the impo rtant i ssue of person alized recomm end a tion s. Person alization h as clearly been on e of the succe ss s tories of Web u sabilit y and u ser experience. The three papers in this s ession p resented n ew app roaches to this impo rtant prob lem.
 In  X  X atego rization o f web pag es and u ser clustering with mixtures of hidd en Marko mod els X , Ypma, and Heskes propo se mixtures of hidd en Markov mod els for mod eling click streams of web surfers. Hence, the page ca tegorization is learned from the data withou t t he need for a (po ssibly cumbersome) manu al categorization Theye p rovide a n EM algorithm for training a mixture of HMM s and sho w that add ition al static user data ca n b e incorpo rated easily to po ssibly enh ance the labeling of users. Furthermore, they use prior kno wledge to enh ance generalization and avoid nu merical prob le ms. They use parameter tying to decrease the danger of over fitti ng and to redu ce c ompu tation al overhead. They pu t a flat prior on the parameters to d eal with the prob lem that certain transition s between p age ca tegories occur very seldo m or no t at all, in order to ensure that a non zero transition p rob abilit y between these ca tegories non etheless remains. In app lication s to artificial data a nd real -world web logs we demon strate the usefulness of ou r app roach. They train a mixture of HMM s on artificial navigat ion p atterns, and sho w that the c orrect mod el is being learned. Moreover, they sho w that the use of static 'satellit e data' may enh ance the labeling of sho rter navigation p atterns. When app lying a mixture of HMM s to real -world web logs from a large Dutch c omm ercial web site, they demon strate that sensible page ca tegorization s are being learned. Hay, Wets, Vanhoo f, in their paper  X  X eb Usag e Mining b y mean s of Multidimensiona l Sequ ence Align ment Method s X , present a new algorithm called Multidimension al Sequ en ce Alignment Method (MDSAM) is illustrated for mining navigation p atterns on a web site. MDSAM examines s equ ences compo sed o f several information types, such as visited p ages and visiting time spent on pages. Besides, MDSAM hand les large databases and u ses heuristics to compu te a multidimension al cost based on on e -dimension al op timal t rajectories. Empirical results s ho w that MDSAM identifies profiles s ho wing v isited p ages, visiting time spent on p ages and the order in which p ages are visited on a web site.
 In  X  X  P rediction Mod el f or User Acce ss Sequ ences X  Frias -Martinez, Karamcheti add ress on e of the impo rtant Internet challenges in coming years, namely the introdu ction o f intelligent services and a more person alized environ ment for users. Analysis of Web se rver logs has been u sed in rece nt years to mod el the behavior of web u sers in o rder to p rovide intelligent services. In this paper we propo se a mod el for predicting sequ ences of user acce sses that is distinguished b y two elements: sequ entiality and person a lization . The c on cept of sequ entiality in the mod el po ssesses three c haracteristics: (1) preservation o f the sequ ence of the c lick stream in the a ntece dent, (2) preservation o f the sequ ence of the c lick stream in the c on sequ ent and (3) a measure of the tim e gap b etween the a ntece dent and the c on sequ ent using the nu mber of user clicks. In o rder to improve its prediction ratio, the mod el i nclud es a person alization scheme in which eac h frequ ent user of a web site has a person al prediction system. The mod el has been d efined as a black bo x that can b e used as part of any intelligent service. As an example, they present a cac he prefetching system based on the prediction mod el. The hit ratio o f the cac he is highly satisfactory. The third session con tinu ed the theme of the second session , and presented fou r papers that describe new direction s in some of the found ation al issues of recomm end ation systems.
 Bergho lz, in h is paper ,  X  X op ing With Spa rsity In A R ecomm end er Syste m X  , repo rts experiments on u sing an implementation o f a recomm end er system called ``Kno wledge Pump'' (KP) develop ed at Xerox. He repeats well -kno wn method s s uch as the Pearson method , bu t also add resses comm on p rob lems of recomm end er systems, in p articular the sparsity prob lem. The sparsity prob lem is the prob lem of having too few ratings and h ence too few correlation s between u sers. He a dd resses this prob lem in two different mann ers. First, he introdu ces ``transitive c orrelation s'', a mechanism to increase the nu mber of correlation s between existing users. Second , he a dd s ``agents'', artificial users that rate in acc ordance with some predefined p references. He sho ws that bo th ideas pay off, albeit i n d ifferent ways: Transitive c orrelation s provide a small h elp for virtually no p rice, whereas rating agents improve the c overage of the system significantly bu t also h ave a negative impact on the system performance.
 In  X  X n the use of con strained a ssociation rules for web mining  X , Yang, Parthasarty and Redd y explo re recomm end ation system further. They ob serve that i n rece nt years there has been an increasing interest and a growing bod y of work in web u sage mining as an und erlying app roach to capturing and mod eling the behavior of users on the web for bu siness intel ligence a nd browser performance e nh ancements. Web u sage mining strategies range from strategies s uch as clustering and collabo rative filtering, to acc urately mod eling sequ ential pattern n avigation . However SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 127 many of these a pp roaches s uffer prob lems in terms of scalabilit y and p erformance (especially on line performance) du e to the size and sparse nature of the data involved and the fact that many of the method s generate c omplex mod els that are less amenable to an on line decision making environ ment. In this pap er, first an app roach is present, which is based on association rule mining. Their algorithm discovers association rules that are c on strained (and o rdered) tempo rally. The a pp roach relies on the simple premise that pages acce ssed rece ntly have a greater in fluence on pages that will be acce ssed in the near future. The a pp roach no t on ly results in b etter prediction s, it also p run es the rule -space significantly produ cing on ly rules that matter, enabling faster on line prediction . Further r efinements based on se qu ential do minance a re a lso evaluated, and p rove to b e qu ite e ffective. Detailed experimental evaluation sho ws ho w the a pp roach is qu ite effective in capturing a web u ser's acce ss patterns; con sequ ently, ou r prediction mod el no t on ly has good p rediction ac curacy, bu t also is more e fficient in terms of space a nd time c omplexity. The app roach is also likely to generalize for e -comm erce recomm end ation systems.
 Oyanagi, Kubo ta, Nakase, in  X  X ining WWW Acce ss Sequ ence by Matrix Clustering  X  explore the issues in s equ ence mining for Web d ata. Sequ ence pattern mining is on e of the most impo rtant method s for mining WWW acce ss log. The Apriori algorithm is well kno wn as a typical algorithm for sequ ence pattern mining. However, it suffers from inh erent difficulties in f ind ing lon g sequ ential patterns and in find ing interesting patterns amon g a hu ge a moun t of results. This article propo ses a new method for find ing sequ ence patterns by matrix clustering. This method decompo ses a sequ ence into a set of sequ ence e lements, ea ch o f which correspond s to an o rdered p air of items. Then matrix clustering is app lied to extract a c luster of similar sequ ences. The resulting sequ ence e lements are c ompo sed into a graph . The method is evaluated with p ractical WWW acce ss log, which sho ws that it is s up erior to the c on vention al method s in find ing lon g sequ ences and in generating a sequ ence graph from the resulting cluster. Now that we have a nu mber of years X  worth o f experience with Web mining, it i s time to evaluate the propo sed algorithms and see ho w effective they are. The third session , titl ed Evalua tion o f Algo rithms , presented two p apers in this impo rtant emerging area. We hop e to see more sub mission s in this area in the future.
 In  X  Evalua tion o f Rec omm end er Algo rithms for an Internet Information Broker ba sed on Simple Association -Rules and on Repeat -Buying Theory X , Gayer -Schu lz, Hahsler present a no vel app roach to evaluating recomm end ation algorithms. Association -rules are a widely used techn iqu e to generate recomm end ation s in comm ercial and research recomm end er systems. Since more a nd more Web sites, especially of retailers, offer automatic recomm end er services using Web u sage mining, evaluation o f recomm end er algorithms becomes increasingly impo rtan t. This paper compares the performance of a recomm end er algorithm based on repeat -bu ying theory kno wn from m arketing research with a recomm end er algorithm that uses association -rules. For the evaluation we c on centrated on ho w w ell t he the patterns extracte d from usage data match the idea of  X  X seful recomm end ation s X  of users. They used u sage data of an edu cation al Internet information broker as inpu t for the recomm end er algorithms and asked u sers from the target group o f the broker to classify a sample of re comm end ation s with regard to their usefulness. In this paper the autho rs present and d iscuss the results of the e valuation o f the two recomend er algorithms using stand ard p erformance measures.
 Finally, in  X  X  he Impa ct of Site Structure and User Environ ment on S ession Recon struction in Web Usag e Ana lysis  X , Berend t, Mob asher, Nakagawa, Spiliopou lou p resent a framework for evaluating session recon struction algorithms  X  which is a fund amental issue for Web Usage Mining. The a nalysis of user behaviou r in the Web presuppo ses a reliable recon struction o f the users' navigation al activities. Coo kies and Web -server -generated session identifiers have been d esigned to allow a faithful session recon struction . However, in the a bsence of reliable method s, analysts must rely on h euristics method s (a) to identify un iqu e visitors to a site, and (b) to d istinguish amon g the ac tivities of such u sers du ring ind epend ent session s. The c haracteristics of the site, such as the site topo logy and structure, as well as the method s used f or data c ollection (e.g., the e xistence of coo kies and reliable synchron ization across multiple servers) may nece ssitate the use of different types of heuristics. In this s tud y, they extend their past work on the reliabilit y of session izing mechanisms, by investigating the impact of site structure on the qu ality of con structed session s. Specifically, they juxtapo se session izing on a frame -based and a frame -free version o f a site. We investigate the behavior of coo kies, Web -server -generated session identific ation , and h euristics that exploit session du ration , page stay time a nd p age linkage. Different measures of session recon struction qu ality, as well as experiments on the impact on the prediction o f frequ ent entry and exit pages, sho w that different recon st ruction h euristics can b e recomm end ed d epend ing on the characteristics of the site. They also p resent first results on the impact of session recon struction h euristics on p rediction app lication s, which ind icate a high qu ality of dynamic recomm end ation s for person alization . WEBKDD 2002 turned ou t to b e a very succe ssful workshop b y all measures. More than __ attend ed it. The qu ality of papers was excellent, the discussion was lively, and a nu mber of interesting endo rsement of the level of interest in this rapidly emerging field of inqu iry.
