 To support the utilization of digital academic information (e.g., scholarly mono-graphs, valuable books, historical materials, etc.), various academic information retrieval systems have been proposed. However, even if users use those systems, many tasks (e.g., evaluating the retrieve d information, generating new queries based on the evaluation results, etc.) are left for the users to find the needed academic information.

To overcome this problem, we propose a novel system for academic infor-mation retrieval. The proposed system is based on a multiagent framework, and designed especially for supporting part of an  X  X volving search, X  which per-forms an important role in information retrieval. In this system, each piece of academic information is structured as an agent and provided with autonomy. Consequently, since a search is iterated by academic information itself, part of an evolving search is entrusted to the system, and the user X  X  load to retrieve academic information can be reduced effectively. This section explains an  X  X volving search, X  and describes the existing methods for information retrieving and their limitations on the evolving search support. 2.1 Evolving Search In real-life searches in information, a set of information retrieved by a query influences user X  X  knowledge. Usually this influence inspires the user with new ideas and new conception of the query. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 1, the search in information is iterated while the user X  X  query is continually shifting in part or whole. This sort of search is called an  X  X volving search X  [1]. Since the change of user X  X  knowledge is fairly active in searching academic information, the evolving search performs an important role also in this process. Therefore, it is expected that a system for supporting the evolving search is effective in academic information retrieval.

Query shifts in the evolving search are of two types; we refer to the one as an  X  X nexpected shift X  and the other as an  X  X xpected shift. X  Since the unexpected shift is chiefly due to the user X  X  own inspiration, it is difficult to predict on a system. Compared to this, the expected shift is mainly caused by the data ob-tained from the information that is retrieved with the preceding query. This type shift corresponds to routine procedures such as retrieve one set of information after another according to the data obtained from the previously retrieved infor-mation. Digital academic information is generally given several metadata (e.g., subject, references, etc.). Therefore, by extracting me tadata from the retrieved information and generating new queries from them, it is possible to produce the expected shifts on the system and release the user from the routine procedures. Hence, in this paper, to support the utilization of academic information, we propose an information retrieval system that produces the expected shifts and carries out part of the evolving search. 2.2 Existing Methods for Information Retrieval To support the utilization of academic information, various systems have been proposed. They assist the users mainly with information searches based on meta-data such as Dublin Core [2], and use the following methods for improving the accuracy in information searching.

However, the existing methods cannot employ them for information search process at an opportune moment in an ap-propriate way, and thus they cannot produce the expected shifts in the evolving search effectively. This section proposes a method for supporting part of the evolving search, and then explains the concept of active information resource, which is a key technique to actualize the proposed method. 3.1 Evolving Search Support Cycle For supporting part of the evolving search in academic information, the proposed method iterates the cycle of the following three steps until the number of itera-tions reaches a given limit or new queries cannot be generated any further. This evolving search support cycle aims to produce the expected shifts on a system effectively.
 Step 1. Basic Search Step 2. Selection Step 3. Query Generation This cycle can be summarized as Fig. 2. Through the iteration of the cycle, the proposed method intends that the set of information retrieved until the t th cycle c ( t ) should be used by the steps in the t + 1 th cycle c ( t +1) at an opportune moment in an appropriate way.
 3.2 Active Information Resource In every evolving search support cycle, the proposed method generates new queries from the set of retrieved academi c information. For generating highly effective new queries, it is necessary to make full use the metadata obtained from each piece of retrieved academic information individually. To achieve this, by employing the concept of active information resource, each piece of academic information is provided with autonomy.

An active information resource is a dis tributed information resource (e.g., text, image, sound, etc.) that is structured as an agent to enhance and extend its activity and flexibility. As shown in Fig. 3, an agent maintains not only the contents of information resource themselves, but also the knowledge and func-tions for supporting the utilization of its contents. When an agent receives a request message from the user or other agents, by using the utilization support knowledge (USK) and invoking the utilization support functions (USFs), the agent carries out tasks for its own contents and responds to the request mes-sage actively. Furthermore, through the exchange of messages, each agent can cooperate autonomously with others in a distributed environment, and achieves complicated tasks flexibly.

By applying this concept to academic information, academic information can actively carry out the steps in the evolving search support cycle, and employ the various metadata obtained from the retrieved academic information at an opportune moment in an appropriate way. This section describes the structure of the proposed academic information re-trieval system, and explains its process for supporting the user X  X  retrieval work. 4.1 Structure of the Proposed System As shown in Fig. 4, the proposed system consists of two areas; one is a  X  X ub-lic area X  and the other is a  X  X ersonal area. X  In the public area, each piece of academic information is structured as an agent (AI-Ag) based on the concept of active information resource, and these AI-Ags are open to all users of the system. Every user has his/her own personal area, where retrieved AI-Ags are stored and an agent (User-Ag) serving as an interface between the user and the system is activated.

Each AI-Ag maintains the contents of academic information themselves, and preserves the metadata of the contents as part of USK. Part of the metadata (currently used in the system) are listed in Table 1. In addition to these, every AI-Ag has USK and USFs for carrying out the evolving search support cycle actively.

A User-Ag maintains a user profile that specifies search conditions and the user X  X  interests (the items specifying t he user X  X  interests are represented by the sets of keywords and priorities) as part of USK. Part of the items (currently used in the system) are listed in Table 2. In addition to these, the User-Ag has USK and USFs for serving as the interfaces between the user and the system as well as between the personal area and the public area.
 4.2 Process in the Proposed System Step 0. Initial Query Generation Step 1. Basic Search Step 2. Selection Step 3. Query Generation
The cycle of Step 1  X  3 is iterated until the number of iterations reaches a given limit max t (Table 2 (1)) or new queries cannot be generated any further. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system, we performed experiments of academic information retrieval. 5.1 Experimental Environment A prototype system was implemented on a PC (Celeron 2.0GHz, 768MB mem-ory, RedHat9.0). AI-Ags and User-Ag were actualized as agents in ADIPS/DASH framework [8]. As shown in Fig. 5, each agent in the ADIPS/DASH framework consists of a communication module CM, knowledge module KM, action module AM, and base process BP. To cooperate with other agents, an agent exchanges messages with others by using the CM, and to perform assigned tasks, the agent controls its own BP through the AM. The KM holds rule sets used for exchanging messages and controlling BP. The USK in AI-Ags and User-Ag was installed as the rule set in the KM, and the USFs were implemented as the BPs (Java programs).
For the experiments, 150 journal papers (information retrieval, network, know-ledge engineering, image processing, and semiconductor) were used as a test set. Each of them was structures as an AI-Ag, and the metadata extracted from a journal paper were installed as part of the USK in the corresponding AI-Ag. Ten graduates of information science enrolled the experiments as test users. Every user selected the required journal papers from the test set in advance. The journal papers selected by each user were regarded as the correct result of information retrieval for the corresponding user in the experiments. Every user set the USK in the User-Ag severally in advance, and through the experiments, each user used the same setting of his/her own User-Ag ( max t ,max n ,min k were set to 5, 3, 2, respectively). 5.2 Results of the Experiments Experiment 1.
 Experiment 2.
 Experiment 3.

Every test user performed Experiment 1, 2, and 3 one time. In Experiment 2 and 3, each user inputted the same keyword as he/she chose in Step 0 of Ex-periment 1. Table 3 summarizes the results of the experiments. The evolving search support cycle improved the precision in academic information retrieval (Experiment 2, 3); moreover, by using the pieces of academic information stored in the personal area, it increased both the recall and the precision substantially (Experiment 3). These results show that the proposed system could employ the metadata obtained from the retrieved academic information effectively. Further-more, the evolving search support cycle reduced the necessary time for academic information retrieval drastically (Experiment 2, 3). The reason for this is that the evolving search support cycle carried out the Query Generation and elimi-nated the time required for the user to generate new queries. These results mean that the proposed system could release the user from the routine procedures. This paper has proposed a novel system for academic information retrieval, and discussed the details and the effectiveness of the proposed system.

The proposed system is based on a multiagent framework, and designed es-pecially for supporting the evolving search caused by expected query shifts. In the proposed system, a search in information is iterated by academic informa-tion itself, and the metadata obtained from the retrieved academic information can be introduced effectively into the search process. The experimental results showed that the proposed system improved the accuracy and the efficiency in the academic information retrieval.

For future research directions, we would like to address the following issues:  X  Currently, the proposed system used naive keyword matching algorithms in  X  To apply the proposed system to a huge set of academic information, some
