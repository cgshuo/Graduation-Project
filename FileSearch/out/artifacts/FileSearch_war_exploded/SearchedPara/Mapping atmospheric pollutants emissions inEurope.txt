The adverse effects of pollutant gases on human health and on climate change (namely the greenhouse-effect) are well known. This is a large-scale problem that crosses national boundaries. Some international protocols have been established in order to impose limits for the emission of several pollutant gases (the Kyoto protocol is an example, focused on the reduction of greenhouse-effect gases) imposing new managerial and economic challenges at a global level [9]. Since the reduction of some gases can affect the emissions of other pollutants [27], an integrated large-scale perspective of the atmospheric pollutants emissions problem should take into account the interactions between different gases.

As other environmental phenomena, the dispersion of atmospheric pollutants is characterized by spatial and temporal va riability. Statistical space-time models have been in creasingly use d to address the environmental problems in general, and the atmospheric pollution issue, in particular. There are a great variety of statistical models to analyse space-time data, in large part, because data are of so many different types [6,14]. The differences between them rely on the basic models X  assumptions and on the dioxide concentrations across Europe, monitored between 1990 and 2001, at 125 sites. Kyriakidis and Journel [15] also use a spatial time-series for modelling the (monthly averaged) sulphate deposition over Europe during the years 1980-1988 at 60 monitoring stations. Ignaccolo [10] focuses on the analysis of an air quality network to classify sites in homogeneous clusters and identify the representative ones. In Sampson and Guttorp [18], Multidimen sional Scaling (MDS) is used for estimating non-stationary spatial covariance on the analysis of environmental space-time data. Non-metric MDS is used for computing, from the original geographical coordinates, a two-dimensional representation of the sampling stations with inter-point distances representing the sample spatial dispersions. Vera et al. [28], use a latent class cluster-MDS model with spatial constraints. The procedure partitions the sample stations into clusters, representing the cluster centres X  in a two dimensional space, while the stations and clusters retain their spatial relationships.

In the present work we focus on a MDS type approach which we consider a valuable tool to ana-lyze not only air pollutants emissions data but several kinds of data for which visualization may be critical (e.g. [29]). The proposed approach relies o n a Multidimensional Unfolding (MDU) analysis of atmospheric pollutants emissions data. MDU is a special MDS technique that deals with off-diagonal input matrices of dissimilarity data. Different (groups of) pollutant gases are considered, as well as its emissions over European c ountries (European Union in 1995 and 2005). In addition, al l the countries and the pollutants are represented in a single map, where the gases emissions produced by the countries are represented by the respective distances. This technique illustrates both the relationships between the gases and their geographical origins, the emitted gas es and the countries: 1) the lower the distances in the map (between gases and countries) the higher the gases X  emissions; 2) similarly, the lower the distances between gases the higher the similarity concerning their emissions by the countries; 3) fi nally, the lower the distances between countries, the more similar are their emissions. To the author X  X  knowledge, this is a new approach for studying the atmospheric pollutants emissions.
 To perform MDU analysis we use the PREFSCAL [2] algorithm. MDU is a non-supervised method. Several indicators may be used to evaluate its solutions. In the present work, we address the issue of determining thresholds for the quality indicators of MDU solutions. This is a new approach which follows a methodology previously used in MDS-Multid imensional Scaling analysis (e.g. [11,16]). It relies on the use of simulated data under the null hypothesis of absence of structure, using the uniform distribution. The proposed approach determines thresholds that represent worst case limits, overcoming subjectivity, common in the evaluation of MDU results.

Besides the present introduction, this paper contains fi ve sections. In the second section, we present the application data and introduce the MDU procedure. In the third section the methodological approach for evaluating MDU solutions is presented. In the following section we describe the simulation which yields thresholds for MDU evaluation measures. The fi fth section concerns the MDU analysis of pollutants emissions in European countries. The last section of this work presents fi nal conclusions and future research topics. 2. Pollutant emissions data and multidimensional unfolding 2.1. The data
In the present work we analyze Eurostat data (http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/ eurostat/home/). It refers to the years of 1995 and 2005 and reports the annual gases per capita emissions of the (at that time) European Union twenty four countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Lux-emburg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, United Kingdom. (Malta is excluded due to data unavailability).

We consider six groups of gases: 1) carbon dioxide  X  CO 2 . 2) methane  X  CH 4 . 3) nitrous oxide  X  N 2 O. 4) sulphur oxides (sulphur dioxide  X  SO 2  X  and sulphur trioxide  X  SO 3 ) 5) nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide  X  NO  X  and nitrogen dioxide  X  NO 2 ). 6) carbon monoxide  X  CO.

Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are greenhouse-effect gases. The main source of carbon dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels. Methane and nitrous oxide are also precursors for tropospheric ozone, agriculture being their main human source.

Sulphur dioxide contributes to acid rain, acidifying lakes and rivers and affecting vegetation, increasing erosion, and to the formation of particulate matter in the atmosphere, affecting climate and contributing to produce a haze that reduces visi bility (smog above urban areas). The main source of sulphur dioxide is coal and oil combustion.

Nitrogen oxides are the most important precursors for tropospheric ozone and particulate matter. They also contribute to acid rain.

Finally, carbon monoxide is a toxic gas, being a major product of the incomplete combustion of carbon and carbon-containing compounds. Carbon monoxide impairs the oxygen admission of people and animals. In addition CO also takes part in the photo-chemical formation of near-surface (tropospheric) ozone.

According to information available in Eurostat (http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/ eurostat/home/), the annual emission of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are estimated and reported under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocoland the Decision 280/2004/EC. The impactofland use,land use changes and forestry (LULUCF) is excluded. The air emissions of sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides are estimated and reported under the Geneva Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), the Gothenburg Protocol and National Emission Ceilings Directive (NEC Directive 2001/81/EC). Carbon monoxide emissions are reported under the Geneva Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP). 2.2. MDU  X  multidim ensional unfolding
In order to analyze arti fi cial gases emissions, per habitant, on the referred 24 European countries, we use these data as proximity measures between the pollutant gases and the countries. Natural gases X  concentrations in the atmosphere vary widely, from 78% by volume of nitrogen  X  N 2  X  to 0,038% of carbon dioxide  X  CO 2  X  and even lower for trace components. Arti fi cial gases emissions also show marked absolute (and per capita) values, with values different by several orders of magnitude. In the adopted methodology, the original per capita gas emissions are standardized.

We then propose the use of non-metric MDU  X  Multidim ensional Unfolding analysis which enables to portray countries and pollutant gases in a two-dimensional space in a way that the more closer a country is from a speci fi c gas, the more emissions of that gas it produces.
 In general, the input for non-metric MDU analysis refers to dissimilarities data (two-way data) of S subjects regarding C objects (two-mode data). Let  X  sc represent the dissimilarity between subject s ( s =1 ,...,S ) and object c ( c =1 ,...,C ) . The MDU input is a rectangular matrix,  X  ( S  X  C ) =[  X  sc ] .
The goal of MDU is to represent both subjects and objects in a low dimensional space. Generally, in applications, a bi-dimensional Euclidean space is used. The resulting MDU con fi guration includes the coordinates vectors of the points representing each subject s and object c: x s and y c , respectively. The Euclidean distance between subject s and object c is denoted by d sc .

The MDU resulting con fi guration is chosen in a way that the order of the input data is maintained by the corresponding fi tted distances. That is, if  X  sc  X  s c then d sc d s c ( s, s =1 ,...,S ; c, c =1 ,...,C ) .
A solution of a non-metric MDU problem is obtained by minimizing a loss function by means of an iterative algorithm. Using ordinal input, an increasing monotone function f is needed to obtain The optimization process involves the approximation of disparities by the distances between the points in a (bi-dimensional) space. Typically, loss functions in MDU are a ratio where the numerator is the squared sum of the differences between disparities and fi tted distances (residuals sum of squares) and the denominator is a normalization factor. These functions are known as STRESS-Standardized Residuals Sum of Squares functions.

In the present work, MDU analysis is performed using the PREFSCAL algorithm [2]. This algorithm has been developed to overcome the problem of degenerated solutions which have a nominally perfect STRESS value, but yield a con fi guration that is very dif fi cult to interpret (with a great number of equal fi tted distances). PREFSCAL uses a process based on iterative majorization to minimize a speci fi c loss-function: P-STRESS-Penalized STRESS:
When using an  X  X nconditional X  approach in MDU, a single monotone transformation is used for all the input values.
 Finally, it is worthwhile to note that MDU can be seen as a special case of MDS-Multidimensional Scaling analysis which is based on one-mode, two-way data (e.g. [1]). In fact, the MDU non-diagonal dissimilarities matrix can be restructured in a square symmetric (S + C)  X  (S + C) matrix, where the values between columns and between rows are assigned as missing. As a consequence, a MDS procedure that allows missing values can be used for performing MDU analysis. 3. Evaluating MDU solutions 3.1. Measures of fi t
There are several alternative measures to evaluate MDU results. STRESS measures are commonly used for the evaluation of MDU solutions. In fact, as stated by [2], the MDU solutions evaluation should take into account several quality measures.
 The most common STRESS forms were proposed by Kruskal [12] and Kruskal and Carrol [13]  X  STRESS-1 and STRESS-2  X  and only differ by the normalization factor: where  X  d is the distances average.

An alternative MDU quality measure is the goodness-of-fi tR 2 [2] which is the proportion of variance of disparities accounted for by corre sponding di stances:
Finally, a correlation coef fi cient between input data and distances may also be used to evaluate MDU solutions  X  the Kendall X  X  coef fi cient  X  b (e.g. [20]). 3.2. Related work and threshold issues
When using STRESS measures, R 2 or Kendall X  X  coef fi cient  X  b , to evaluate MDU solutions an issue still remains to be settled: which indicators X  valu es represent a  X  X ood X  MDU solution? In fact, when referring to (deterministic) MDU models, there is a gap in the literature concerning the determination of appropriate thresholds for these measures of fi t.

When referring to MDS there are, however, some contributions in the literature regarding threshold issues.
 Kruskal [12] suggests an empirical approach to derive some rules for evaluating a MDS solution. Based on his  X  X xperience with experimental and synthetic data X  ([12, p. 3]) he proposes the following benchmarks for STRESS-1: STRESS-1 = 0.2 corresponds to a  X  X oor X  solution; STRESS-1 = 0.1,  X  X air X  solution; STRESS-1 = 0.05,  X  X ood X  solution; STRESS-1 = 0.025,  X  X xcellent X  solution, and fi nally, STRESS-1 = 0, corresponds to a  X  X erfect X  solution.

In the literature, there are several Monte Carlo st udies which derive the distribution of STRESS under the null hypothesis of input data (di ssimilarities) randomness. The derived STRESS X  distribution enables number of points, dime nsionality, the kind and amount of e rror in data, etc.) are also taken into account in the derived STRESS performance. Some works concerning this issue are reported next, all referred to one-mode, two-way proximity data, where a non-metric MDS procedure is used. In these studies the STRESS function under analysis is the objective (badness-of-fi t) function considered by the algorithm used.

Several authors compute the STRESS-1 distribution for different combinations of N (number of points in the con fi guration) and H (the di mensionality of the M DS space). For each comb ination of N and H, dissimilarities are then randomly generated. Sten son and Knoll [24] and Spence and Ogilvie [21] use random permutations of the fi rst N C 2 integers as dissimilarities. Klahr [11] randomly assigns proximity values from a uniform -U(0,1)-distribution. Levine [16] uses a similar approach for analyzing STRESS-2. Spence [22], using Spence and Ogilvie [21] data, derive an analytic expression which takes as arguments N and H, and yields the expected STRESS-1 value. Levine [16], compares the two Kruskal X  STRESS formulas, concluding that, for two-dimensional solutions, the average of STRESS-2 values is approximately equal to two and a half times the corresponding average of STRESS-1 values. The reported simulation studies show that for a given dimension of the MDS space, the expected STRESS (STRESS-1 or STRESS-2) value increases with the number of points. On the other hand, for a given number of points, if the number of dimensions grows, then the expected STRESS values become smaller.
There is an alternative approach which has been used in the literature focused on  X  X xternal X  MDS evaluation (e.g. [4,5,19,30]). This approach is based on apriori knowledge of the  X  X rue X  con fi guration which guides the evaluation of MDS solutions. However, this is not a practical situation. In fact, in real applications, the  X  X rue X  con fi guration is not known and the analyst has to deal with an unsupervised evaluation procedure.
 The obtained results referred to STRESS-1 and STRESS-2 have a limited use for the evaluation of MDU solutions. Since MDU analysis relies on a rect angular dissimila rity matrix, additional technical challenges have to be considered when compared to MDS. In fact, when considering the MDU input data restructured into a square symmetric (S + C)  X  (S + C) matrix, a lot of data are missing. Moreover, these missing data are not randomly sca ttered thr oughout the matrix: missing data refer to the proximities between subjects and between objects and constitute two separate blocks in the matrix. In MDS an almost perfect recovery of the underlying con fi guration is possible even if 80% of the input data are missing. However, this result depends on a systematic interlocking of the missing dissimilarities [1,23] which is not the case in MDU. Thus, a new approach is needed for providing the evaluation of MDU solutions. 3.3. The proposed approach
In the context of MDU deterministic models, the evaluation of an empirical solution can be made by the de fi nition of benchmarks regarding evaluation meas ures. In this work a met hodology is proposed which enables to establish thresholds for STRESS-2, R 2 and  X  b . It follows previous works in MDS [11,16,21, 22,24], similar works in the unsupervised analysis setting [3] and a preliminary study in MDU [17].
The proposed approach is based on the analysis of the results derived by a simulation study. In the simulation procedure, input data for MDU is randomly generated according to a uniform distribution. The MDU results derived for these input data having no structure can be seen as  X  X he worst that can happen X  concerning the MDU analysis performance. Quality indicators X  average values  X  for STRESS measures, R 2 and  X  b  X  are obtained which are associated with data having no structure (simulated data). Thus, the analysis of results obtained by the simulation study, allow establishing thresholds for the referred measures, which can be used for MDU solutions evaluation in practical applications.
Since in real applications the simulation scenarios may not hold (alternative S and C values may be considered), a simple linear regression model may be used to estimate thresholds in alternative applications settings: for each one of the MDU quality m easures the co rresponding thresholds may be obtained by a simple linear regression model, using the number of observations (S  X  C) as a predictor. Finally, for a given empirical MDU solution, its evaluation is obtained by comparing the obtained results with the estimated thresholds. 4. Simulated data analysis 4.1. MDU analysis
Input (non-preferences)data are randomly generatedaccording to a Uniform distribution on the interval [0,100]. Thus, initial MDU input data matrices are de fi ned in a scale ranging from 0 to 100. Five alternative scenarios concerning the dimensionality of input data matrix are considered: (S = 5, C = 10); (S = 5, C = 15); (S = 5, C = 20); (S = 10, C = 20) and (S = 10, C = 30). For each one of these cases, a set of 25 data matrices are analyzed.

For reducing the possib ility of the algorithm stopping in a lo cal minimum, a hundred random starting con fi gurations are used and the solution with the lowest PSTRESS value is selected. The algorithm stops when one of the following criteria is reached: the maximum number of iterations (5000), the minimum PSTRESS value (0.0001) or the difference in consecutive PSTRESS values is less or equal to 0.000001. 4.2. Simulation results The STRESS measures, R 2 and Kendall X  X  coef fi cient  X  b are taken into account for solutions evaluation. The use of STRESS-1 as a loss-function for MDU should be avoided due it can lead to degeneracies [7, 26]. In fact, STRESS-2 have been suggested in order overcome this problem [13]. However STRESS-1 is commonly used in practice and its values may be compared with those obtained in previous studies conducted on MDS context.

The simulation study results are presented in Table 1. For each one of the fi ve alternative scenarios, 25 input data matrices are analyzed. The results refer only to non-degenerated solutions. Degenerate solutions were discarded taking into account the values of the R 2 measure, the Shepard Index [2]  X  the ratio between the number of distinct distances and the total number of distances  X  and the variation coef fi cient of disparities.

The expected STRESS-1 and STRESS-2 increase with the number of input items (S and C), which agrees with the MDS reported studies [11,16,21,22,24]. R 2 averages decrease as STRESS averages increase.

The simulation results allow us to conclude that, as the number of input subjects and objects gets higher the MDU fi tting gets worst. This is an expected conclusion since more input items represent a greater number of constraints to the MDU problem. Furthermore, this conclusion emphasizes that the the dimensionality of the input data matrix.

Further comparisons of the results obtained in the present study with other results presented in the 1) Previous studies [11,16,21,22,24] rely on algorithms which are based on the minimization of 2) For avoiding local minima problems, we use 100 random starting con fi gurations. In other reported 3) Some studies [21,24],use as input dissimilarities,random permut ations of integers,which constitute Despite these considerations, some rough comparisons can be made with the results obtained by Klahr [11] and Levine [16] where dissimilarity values are randomly assigned by means of a uniform distribution, similarly to the approach used in present work. Klahr [11], considered the cases of 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 16 numbers of points in the con fi guration. For 16 points, he obtained an average STRESS-1 value of 0.279. In the present work, for 15 number of points (S + C), STRESS-1 has an average of 0.145. This comparison suggests that in MDU lower values for STRESS-1 are expected. In fact, when comparing MDU with MDS (for a complete input data matrix), the fi rst has less constraints due to the number of missing values and thus a better fi t is expected. However, this observation may not be de fi nitive since previous studies may suffer from local minima problems. 4.3. Capitalizing on simulation results
The simulation results yield the  X  X orst X  values for MDU fi t measures ( X  X orst X  MDU performance), since they refer to data with no structure. Therefore the correspondent averages can be interpreted as thresholds for an acceptable MDU solution.

In order to de fi ne thresholds for a given MDU input matr ix dimensionality (it should be within the range of the analyzed simulated data), we use a simple linear regression approach. For each one of the referred MDU quality measures, the estimation is based on the results of the fi ve simulation scenarios, using the number of observations ( Nobs = S  X  C ) as a predictor and each quality m easure as the dependent variable. This analysis is performed for the main indicators on the evaluation of an MDU the regression model is low (0.693)) we only present the estimated models referred to R 2 and STRESS-2 (see Table 2). For the adjusted models the corresponding estimated coef fi cients (intercept and slope) are signi fi cantly different from zero, at the level of signi fi cance of 1%.

For a given empirical MDU solution, the corresponding and STRESS-2 should thus be compared with the estimated (by simple linear regression models) thresholds. The larger the gap between the obtained MDU solution quality measures and the estimated thresholds, the better the MDU solution. 5. Pollutant gases emissions in European countries
In the present work we suggest a new methodological approach to analyze the data referring to the emissions of different (groups of) pollutant gases over European countries (in a given year). We use MDU analysis for data referring to the years of 1995 and 2005. In each case we consider 24 countries (S = 24) and 6 groups of gases (C = 6).
 MDU analysis is performed using the PREFSCAL al gorithm. In particular, a non-metric unconditional MDU analysis is used. Each country (s = 1 ... 24) per capita emission of pollutant gases (c = 1 ... 6) can be seen as a similarity measure between s and c, represented by  X  sc .

The  X  sc values are standardized into a 0-100 scale as follows: subtracting to the initial emissions data the minimum of the emissions of gas c, in all the countries, and then dividing for the maximum (of the obtained by  X  sc = 100  X   X  sc .

Starting con fi gurations in the PREFSCAL algorithm include 200 randomly generated con fi gurations inequality for imputation of the values between rows and between columns).

In the MDU derived maps (referring to 1995 and 2005), the gases emissions produced by the countries are represented by the respective distances, in a way that the more closer a country is from a speci fi cgas, the higher the emissions.

Before interpreting the MDU maps one should evaluate the MDU fi tting. In Table 3 the STRESS-2 and R 2 results (for both 1995 and 2005 solutions) are presented. For comparison purposes the thresholds derived from the simulation study are also presented (see Table 2 for the correspondent linear regression model).

According to the referred results, both the 1995 and 2005 solutions are good/acceptable. In fact, the results for R 2 are greater than the thresholds and the results for STRESS-2 are lower than the corresponding values corresponding to unstructured data. The 1995 solution is better than 2005 solution since it corresponds to the greater gap between the obtained results and the corresponding thresholds.
The MDU maps corresponding to 1995 and 2005 (good MDU solutions) are presented in Figs 1 and 2, respectively. In order to turn easier the interpretation of both maps, the 1995-map has been rotated 180 o . Generally, when comparing the gases emissions in 1995 and 2005, the scenario has changed. The countries rank emissions have clearly changed in this decade. Ireland is the country with the greater emissions of methane and nitrous oxide. In fact, Ireland is clearly separated from the other countries (in both of the maps) representing a distinct situation considering gases emissions. In 1995 the United Kingdom and Italy have a similar pro fi le, especially when concerning the carbon monoxide emissions. However, in 2005, the two countries are apart in the map, indicating that UK is much far from being one of the greatest carbon monoxide emitters. In 1995 Austria was a greater emitter of nitrous oxide, but in 2005 the situation change d and Austria became a greater em itter of carbon monoxide. Similar analysis can be made for all the remaining countries and pollutant gases. In addition, we can refer that the pollutants positioning is similar in both maps. 6. Conclusions and perspectives
MDU is a well known data analysis technique for two-way, two-mode proximities data, providing a regions with diverse corresponding attributes can be good candidates to be represented using the MDU techniques. When referred to applications, the use of deterministic models instead of probabilistic ones has the advantage of requiring no assumptions concerning data characteristics. However, there is an open issue in deterministic MDU which refers to the evaluation of its solutions: there are no clear benchmarks for indicating  X  X ood X /acceptable solutions on a deterministic context. In the present work, an approach based on simulated data is proposed, which helps to support the MDU results evaluation.

The proposed methodology enables to establish thresholds for MDU evaluation measures. It relies on the simulation of unstructured data (uniformly distributed). In addition, a simple linear regression model is used for the estimation of thresholds referring to scenarios which (slightly) differ from the simulated ones.

When evaluating a speci fi c empirical MDU solution, with a particular number of observations, the corresponding MDU quality measures  X  R 2 and STRESS-2  X  are compared with the derived thresholds.  X  X ood X  MDU solutions should thus exhibit goodness-of-fi t measure (R 2 ) values greater than the derived thresholds and STRESS-2 values lower than the corresponding threshold. In fact, the better the solution, the greater should be the gap between its qua lity indicators X  values and the corresponding null thresholds.
In the present work we perform an MDU analysis of atmospheric pollutants emissions in European countries, capitalizing on the proposed methodology for the evaluation of the obtained results. The use of MDU in this speci fi c application has some advantages when compared to alternative approaches in the literature dealing with this type of data. In fact, the proposed approach enables a macro and integrated view of the pollutant gases emissions. By taking into account several different (groups) of gases it also has the advantage of giving additional information about the relationships between these gases emissions. According to proposed methodology for evaluating the derived MDU we found good solutions for the referred application.
 Future research may focus on the analysis of alternative MDU evaluation measures: e.g. Young X  X  S-STRESS2 formula [25]. Alternative simulation scenarios may also be considered and the relationship between the MDU quality indicators and the simulation factors (number of subjects and objects) further explored.
