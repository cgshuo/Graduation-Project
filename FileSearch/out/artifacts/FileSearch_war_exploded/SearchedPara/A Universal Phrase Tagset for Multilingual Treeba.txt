 In the past twenty years, many treebanks were developed, such as the Chinese tre e-bank [1][2] , English treebank [3][4] , German treebank [5] , French treebank [6] , and Portuguese treebank [7][8] , etc. There are mainly two types of parsing structure, d e-pendenc y structure and phrase structure. For the phrase structure treebanks, to capture the characteristics of specific languages, they tend to design different phrase tagsets. The phrase categories span from ten to twenty or even more. This is indeed helpful in the syntax analysis of the special in -cased language. However, the different phrase tagsets also make inconvenience for the multilingual research. To facilitate the further research of multilingual tasks, this paper designs a refined universal phrase tagse t using 9 common phrase categories. The mappings between the phrase tagsets from the existing phrase structure treebanks and the universal phrase tagset are conducted, which covers 25 treebanks and 21 languages. 
T o evaluate the designed universal phrase t agset and the phrase tagset mapping works, the parsing experiments are conducted for intrinsic analysis on the available corpora, including Penn Chinese t reebank (CTB -7) from Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) 1 for Chinese, the Wall Street Journal ( WSJ) Tree bank from LDC for English, Floresta 2 -bosque Treebank for Portuguese, Euro -Fr 3 corpus for French, and Negra 4 Treebank [5] for German. T he universal phrase tagset is designed to include Noun phrase (NP), Verbal phrase (VP), Adjectival phrase (AJP), Adverbial phrase (AVP), Prepositional phrase (PP), sentence or sub -sentence (S), Conjunction phrase (CONJP), Coordinated phrase (COP), and others (X) for covering the list marker, interjection, URL, etc.

T he refined phrase tagset m apped from 25 existing treebanks to the universal phrase categories is detailed in Table 1. M ost of the mapping is easily understood except for some special cases. F or instance, the Chinese phrase tag DNP (phrase formed by something+associative  X  ) is mappe d into AJP because it specifies the adjective phrase. T he Chinese phrase tag DVP ( something+DEV  X  ) is mapped into AVP due to that the character  X   X   X  specifies an adverbial phrase in Chinese. T o validate the effectiveness of the universal phrase tagset, we conduct the evaluation on the parsing task. We first construct the parsing models based on original treebanks, training and testing. T hen, the experiment is repeated by replacing the treebanks with ones annotated with the universal phrasal tags. T he parsing experiments are conducted on the t reebank s covering Chinese (CN), English (EN), Portuguese (PT), French (FR), and German (DE).

T he experiment s are based on the Berkeley parser [9] , which focuse s on l earning probabilistic context -free grammars (PCFGs) to assign a sequence of words the most likely parse tree , and introduces the hierarchical latent variable grammars to automat i-cally learn a broad coverage grammar starting from a simple initial one. The g enera t-ed grammar is refined by hierarchical splitting, merging and smoothing. T he Berkeley parser generally gains the best testing result using the 6 th smoothed grammar [10] . F or a broad analysis of the experiments, we tune the parameters to learn the refi ned grammar by 7 times of splitting, merging and smoothing except 8 times for French treebank. T he experiments are conducted on a server with the configuration stated in generated grammar ( MB ), and the parsing scores , i.e., Labeled P recision ( L Pre), L a-beled R ecall ( L Rec), the harmonic mean of precision and recall ( F1 ), and exact match (Ex). 3.1 P arsing of Chinese For Chinese, we use the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB -7) [1] [2] . We adopt the stan d-ard splitting criteria for the training and testing data. The training documents contain CTB -7 files 0 -to -2082, the development documents contain files 2083 -to -2242, and the testing documents are files 2243 -to -2447 .

In Table 3,  X  X  ni -gr -n X  and  X  X ri -gr -n X  mean the n th grammar using the un i-versal and original tags respectively. The experiment shows that the testing scores of precis ion, recall and F1 are gradually higher using the refined grammars on universal phrase tagset than the scores using the original treebank tags, even though the begi n-ning scores are lower from the first smoothed grammar. The exact mat c h score using the univ ersal phrase tagset also exceeds the corresponding score using original tagset after the 5th smoothed grammar. T he highest precision, recall, F1 and exact scores are 85.58 (85.06), 83.24 (83.01), 84.4 (83.99), and 25.33 (24.73) respectively by using the un iversal phrase tagset (original phrase tags).

F urthermore, the training cost of the universal phrase tagset including the grammar size and the training time is much less than that of the original one especially for the latterly refined grammars. T he gramma r size (65.55 MB) and training time (94.79 hours) using the original tagset almost doubles that ( 34.53 MB &amp; 56.25 hours ) of the universal one for the learning of 7 th refined grammar. 3.2 P arsing of English F or English , we use the Wall Street Journal treebank from the L DC. T he WSJ section 2 -to -21 corpora are for training, section 22 for developing, and section 23 for testing [29] . T he learning curves of EN for training cost and testing scores are shown in Fi g-ure 2. The experiment results on EN are similar to t hat on CN. The highest testing scores of precision, recall, and F1 are 91.45 (91.25), 91.19 (91.11) and 91.32 (91.18) respectively on universal phrase tags (and original phrase tagset). I t takes 38.67 (51.64) hours and 30.72 (47.00) MB of memory during the training process for the 7 th refined grammar respectively on universal (original) tagset.
 3.3 P arsing of Portuguese T he Bosque t reebank is a subset of Floresta Virgem corpora [7] [8] with a size of 162,484 lexical units. W e utilize 80 percent of the sentences for training, 10 percent for developing and another 10 percent for testing. They are 7393, 939, and 957 se n-tences respectively. T he learning curves of training cost and test scores are demo n-strated in Figure 3.

T he evaluation scores using the universal phrase tags are much higher than the ones using original tags after the 5 th smoothed grammar. T he highest scores of prec i-sion, recall and F1 are 81.84 (81.44), 80.81 (80.27) and 81.32 (80.85) respectively on universal (original) tags. I t takes 3.69 (4.16) hours and 9.17 (10.02) MB of memory during the training process for the 7 th refined grammar respectively on universal (ori g-inal) tagset . 3.4 P arsing of Ge rman W e utilize t he version 2.0 of Negra corpus [5] for German parsing, which consists of 355,096 tokens and 20,602 sentences German newspaper text with completely ann o-tated syntactic structures. We use 8 0 percent (16,482 sentences) of corpus for training, 10 percent (2,060 sentences) for developing and 10 percent (2,060 sentences) for tes t-ing. T he learning curves are shown in Figure 4.

T he evaluation scores of DE language using universal phrase tags are slightly higher than the ones using original tags. T he highest scores of precision, recall, F1 are 81.35 (81.23), 81.03 (81.02), and 81.19 (81.12) respectively on universal (original) tags. D ifferent from the wining of synthetically F1 score, the exact matched sentence score on DE language is generally lowe r using the universal tags than using the orig i-nal tags, and the generated grammar size becomes larger after 5 th smoothing using the universal tags than the sizes using the original tagset. 3.5 P arsing of French D ifferent with previous standard language treebanks, which are available by license agreement for research or commercial purpose, t o generate a usable and reliable French treebank corpus, we first extract 20,000 French sentences from Europarl co r-pora that are from the proceedings of the European Parliament. Then, we parse the French plain text using the Berkel ey French grammar  X  X ra_sm5.gr X  [10] with the par s-ing accuracy around 0.80. T he parsed Euro -Fr corpus is used for the training stage.
For the developing and testing corpora, we use the WMT12 and WMT13 French plain text from the international workshop of statistical machine translation by SIGMT 5 . T hey contain 3,003 and 3,000 sentences respectively, which are parsed by the same parser. The experi ment results of learning curves are shown in Figure 5. T he evaluation results of FR show that the comprehensive F1 score using the universal tagset can also finally win the one using the original tagset, even though the exact match score is lower as the DE language. Similarly , the training cost using the unive r-sal tagset is much less. T he highest precision, recall, and F1 scores are 80.49 (80.34), 80.93 ( 80.96 ), and 80.71 (80.64) respectively using universal (original) tagset.
I t takes 13.66 (28.91) hours and 12.07 (16.66) MB of memory during the training process for the 8 th refined grammar respectively on universal (original) tagset. Han et al. [30] proposed a universal ph rase tagset and designed the mapping between the universal tagset and the ones of French and English Treebank. However, we e x-tended the tagset mapping into 25 existing treebanks coving 21 languages; furthe r-more, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design ed tagset mapping by parsing e x-periments on five available treebanks in this work. Other related work about phrase structures include [31], [32], and [33]. Naseem et al. [36] employ ed some manually specified universal dependency rules for grammar induction and achieve d improv e-ment in dependency parsing. McDonald et al. [37] design ed a universal annotation approach for dependency treebanks. Rambow et al. [34] conduct ed a research about parallel syntactic annotation for multiple languages. Petrov et al. [35] develop ed a universal part -of -speech (PoS) tagset containing 12 commonly used PoS tags. T o facilitate the future researches in multilingual tasks, we have designed a refin ed universal phrase tagset and the tagset mapping from existing 25 treebanks into the universal tagset. T o validate the designed work, evaluations are performed on parsing experiments . T he evaluation on a range of language treebanks shows that the unive r-sal phrase tagset can generally improve the highest precision, recall and F1 testing score, especially on the Portuguese language , and reduce the training time and the size of generated grammar, especially on the Chinese, English and French languages. I n t he future, we plan to evaluate the parsing on more language treebanks, and utilize the universal phrase tagset into other multilingual applications.
