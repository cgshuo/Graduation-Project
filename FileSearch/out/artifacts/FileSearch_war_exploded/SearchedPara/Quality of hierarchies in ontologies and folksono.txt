 1. Introduction
With the emergence of the Semantic Web [5] and Semantic Web related technologies, ontologies are becoming increasingly im-traction (e.g. [32] ), etc.

Manual ontology engineering is an expensive and time consuming task [7] . Variables that add complexity to the task include that expert modelers are not sufficiently well articulated within the domain, while domain experts on the other hand are not application(s).

Folksonomies have also seen a rise in popularity over the last years, both with respect to use and research. The word folksonomy was coined by Vander Wal [30] and is a concatenation of folk and tax onomy . A folksonomy consists mainly of three en-can be browsed and found later by both tagger and other users of the community. Examples of popular sites that employ tagging are among others Delicious [8] (general web resources), Flickr [10] (image sharing), and BibSonomy [15] (bookmark and publication eral works have been published which use different techniques to structure folksonomies (e.g. [18, 13, 34] ).
Hierarchical structures, both ontological and folksonomy based, would benefit from having a measure which allows us to evaluate the structure and gives information on the quality of these structures. To this end, we present in this paper a method for exposing desirable properties in these hierarchical structures with respect to subsumption. The proposed approach is based on generating a shallow semantic representation for both concepts (concept signatures in the ontology case) and tags (tag signa-tures in the folksonomy case). These representations take the form of vectors of related terms. The vectors are constructed in a coherent manner, meaning that the vectors have the same underlying theoretic groundings for both ontology and folksonomy.
The vectors describe the semantics of the concepts/tags based on an underlying document collection (ontology case) or tagged documents (folksonomy case). The objective of our approach is to use the textually based shallow semantic representations of concepts and tags to evaluate the quality of the hierarchical structures. Four different hypotheses are presented and we argue that the hypotheses specify desirable properties of hierarchical structures in terms of the underlying textual representation of concepts and tags. Our evaluation based on both ontology and folksonomy based hierarchies indicate that the proposed approach can be a valuable addition for quality control of hierarchical structures.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows; Section 2 gives an overview of related work, while Section 3 gives an introduction to the vector representation for ontologies, ontological profiles. Section 4 gives an overview of the vector representation of the folksonomy and Section 5 introduces the approach and describes our hypotheses on structural properties.
The evaluation details are described in Section 6 , while our findings are reported and commented on in Section 7 . Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 8 . 2. Related work Ontology evaluation is by Pak and Zhou [19] partitioned into quality attribute-based approaches and task-oriented approaches . error checking of the ontology. Task-oriented approaches are on the other hand more focused towards the use of the ontology in applications. In this paper we are most interested in ontology evaluation as described by the first category.
Guarino et al. presents in [12] the OntoClean methodology for validating taxonomic relations in ontologies. The methodology is based on philosophical conceptions like essence, identity, and unity. These conceptions are used as meta properties on the taxonomic structure describing the classes ( [12] uses the term property about classes). The meta properties described by the au-ging the concepts with meta properties and next the tags in the subsumption hierarchy are analyzed. The methodology imposes constraints on the subsumption of concepts with certain combinations of meta properties. By removing subsumption relations that violate these constraints, relationships that were ill-defined from the designer's part are avoided.
RDF/OWL ontology with meta properties. The authors use positive and negative evidence found in a large corpus (the Web) as ative evidence by querying the Google API. The patterns are in the form of a natural language string with a variable that is replaced by the concept in question. One example of such a pattern is with the concept in question (e.g.  X  student  X  ) this specific pattern provides negative evidence for the Rigid meta property (a class is considered Rigid when an instance cannot stop being an instance of that class, e.g. a human cannot stop being a human, on the other hand, a student can stop being a student). The results from Google are analyzed by part-of-speech tagging the result to remove results that give false match for the pattern. Finally they use a classifier to decide whether or not a meta property is applicable to the concept based on the evidence.

Sleeman et al. [23] presents an approach to refine the taxonomy structure in ontologies based on WordNet [9] (although the authors argue that the approach is applicable using sources other than WordNet providing the same type of information). For each concept in the ontology (which also exists in WordNet), its path up to the root ( relations are identified as relations in which the parent concept's path up to the root in WordNet is not found as part of the child concepts path in WordNet. The remaining concepts and relations are found to be consistent according to the approach and the tree is considered the basis. All concepts/sub trees which have been removed, are then added back to the tree one at a time. At each step, the new tree is checked for consistency and rearrangements are made if nodes can be given a more correct placement based on the new insertions and the WordNet paths.

Burton-Jones et al. [6] present a suite of metrics for evaluating ontologies for the Semantic Web. The authors focus on four ity aspect of the approach is the clarity of an ontology, which is a measure for the ambiguity of terms used in the ontology by counting WordNet senses. The approach also evaluates the richness of the ontology in terms of the number of language constructs of the modeling language used. Our approach on the other hand is not relying on external information sources like WordNet and as the authors point out, across the library of ontologies evaluated (280 DAML ontologies) only 43% of the terms were found in WordNet. Our approach is only focused at the hierarchical relations and does not measure the same aspects as [6] .
Tartir et al. [29] present the ontology evaluation tool OntoQA. The tool partitions the quality metrics into schema and knowledgebase metrics. The first set of metrics target the ontology design and focus on quality attributes such as width, depth, measure of the proportion of classes that have instances attached to them.

Ontometrics by Sicilia et al. [22] is an open source tool that implements several ontology quality metrics found in the litera-ture. The authors present and discuss the statistical analysis of running the metric suite on over 1400 ontologies downloaded plexity of an ontology based on a graph representation of OWL ontologies. Two classes of metrics are presented; ontology-level which describe design complexity, and class-level which describe the ontology's complexity at the class level. An example of an ontology-level metric is the tree impurity (TIP) metric, which measures the deviation of the ontology from a tree structure. An example of a class-level metric is the Number of Children (NOC) which measures for a given class its number of children. 3. Ontological pro fi les
An ontological profile is an ontology extended with vectors of terms for each concept of the ontology, concept signatures . These terms are regarded as semantic descriptions of the concept at hand, based on an underlying document collection. Moreover, the term concept vector to refer to concept signature.

De fi nition 1. Concept signature. Let T be the set of n terms in the document collection used for construction of the ontological profile. t i  X  T denotes term i in the set of terms. Then the concept vector for concept j is defined as the vector C w ] where each w i denotes the semantic relatedness weight for each term t
Our approach to the construction of the ontological profile is systematic; we have defined a method of assigning documents and their terms to each concept of the ontology. The terms are taken as the semantic representation of the concepts in the form of term vectors. For a more detailed description of ontological profiles, see [25] . [25] also reports on our previous work which uses ontological profile as a basis for information retrieval using query expansion. 4. Tag signatures and folksonomy hierarchy
This section will present the concept of tag signatures , which can be interpreted analogous to the concept signatures of the on-tological profile and a short overview of the structured folksonomy. 4.1. Tag signatures
A folksonomy is a collection of triples [14] { u i , t k , r properties of the resources. When working with the ontological profiles, the question of how one should assign documents to con-respect to the tag and at the same time are good at discriminating the tag from other tags be weighted highly. For this reason we
De fi nition 2. Tag signature. Let V be the set of n terms (vocabulary) in the collection of tagged resources. t the set of terms. Then the tag vector for tag j is defined as the vector T latedness weight for each term t i with respect to tag T j
As seen from the definition of tag signatures above, for each tag, each term in the collection is given an associated weight which reflects the importance of the term with respect to the tag. Together the terms in the vector and their associated weights bookmarking service. 4.2. Folksonomy hierarchy
Our approach to generating a hierarchical structure of tags is based on association rule mining bookmarks using the Apriori algo-the consequence. To see this, assume two tags A and B and a set of bookmarks tagged with B (which may be tagged with additional cialization of B . In association rule terms, the rule A  X  5. Approach
Our approach of using vectors of weighted terms associated with ontological concepts and folksonomy tags gives us a seman-speech (POS) tagging with stop words removed. In our current evaluation on the folksonomy tag signatures and structure (details are found in Section 6 ), we have used three different preprocessing techniques; (1) removing stop words and stemming the terms, (2) filtering on POS, removing stop words, stemming, and splitting phrases, and (3) filtering on POS, removing stopwords, omy structure generated, respectively.

Since we are interpreting the signatures semantically, we argue that by analyzing them we should be able to find properties included in the sets is thresholded so that we only keep the n highest weighted (most important) terms from the vector repre-sentation. Set operations are performed on the resulting sets. The cosine similarity is calculated according to Eq. (1) where V and V j are the vectors representing either concept i and j or tag i and j , respectively and sim ( V
V and V j . w n , l is the weight for term n in vector l and t the total number of terms.
The approach does not consider the semantics of separate words other than removing words that are stop words and words that are not tagged as nouns using part-of-speech-tagging (in cases where POS filtering is applied). Moreover, we do not consider the implicit relations between words, only how the words sum up to describe the concepts of the ontology.
We have proposed four different hypotheses about properties of the hierarchical relations in the structures based on the two measures described (cosine similarity and set relations). 5.1. Hypotheses
We will in this subsection describe our four hypotheses and argue for why they are reasonable. For the sake of making the explanation of the hypothesis simpler, we will use the notation described below. We are dealing with both ontologies and hierarchically structured folksonomies, so when we are talking about a concept we are talking about a concept of the ontology or a tag in the structured folksonomy. The structure (ontology/folksonomy hierarchy) will be referred to as simply the hierarchy.
A concept C of the hierarchy has n sub concepts, C i . All concepts C disregarding the weights of S ) is given by S  X  . Likewise, for the sub concepts, the vector representation of sub concept C
U and the corresponding set representation is given by U  X  i Hypothesis 1. The relationship between super and sub concept is stronger than between the sub concepts.
In Hypothesis 1 we state that we expect tofindthatthe relation between a concept and it's subsumer is generally stronger than the direct relation(s) between a concept and its sub concept(s) should contain some commonality that we should be able to observe. for each S and all its corresponding sub vectors U i , U j
Hypothesis 2. Characterizations of super concept and sub concept overlap semantically, but refer to different levels of abstraction.

In Hypothesis 2 we express that although the super concept and the sub concept are related, they refer to different abstraction for the sub concept. In terms of sets, we expect to find that there is some overlap between the concepts' set representations.
Evidence supporting this hypothesis should be found in the form S fully of the other set.
 Hypothesis 3. Commonalities among sub concepts are defined by their super concept.

The interpretation of Hypothesis 3 is that the super concept, being the more general concept in the hierarchy, defines some least common  X  description  X  or set of terms that we should be able to find among the sub concepts. In other words we are expect-ing to find that the super concept has a partitioned terminology; one that describes abstract features and one describing more specific features of the concept. For this hypothesis to be true, we expect to find a common terminology among the sub concepts porting this hypothesis should be (  X  i =1 n U  X  i )\ S  X  Hypothesis 4. There are abstract features of a super concept that are not shared by any subclass.
 applicable to the sub concepts' lower level of abstraction. We use the same argumentation as in Hypothesis 3 , in which we stated that we expect to find a partitioned terminology for the concepts. In Hypothesis 3 we were looking at the commonalities between abstract features of the super concept. The super concept should describe the concept at a higher level and should therefore contain terminology that is not interesting to deal with on the more detailed level of the sub concept. Evidence supporting this hypothesis should be S  X  \(  X  i =1 n U  X  i )  X  X  X  and | S  X  6. Evaluation
This section will present the data sets used for the two evaluations. We start with a description of the data set and the param-current evaluation (folksonomy hierarchy). 6.1. Ontology based data set and settings
We downloaded two snapshots of the web site (2004 and 2008) using the web site of the Internet Archive
Wayback Machine. The download was guided by the site map for each of the snapshots. For the 2004 snapshot we managed to download all 207 files, while for the 2008 we kept only 369 out of 424 files. The reason for abandoning the remaining files were that they did not have any content or that they were subject to a evaluation this will suffice. We also assume that the quality of the DNV ontology is good with respect to sub classing, since the ontology has been developed over many years and is continuously updated. Taking this into account, we consider our data as a valid basis upon which we can make conclusions about quality aspects of ontologies.

For each of the concepts of the ontology we created a concept signature. As we have defined each web page in the hierarchy to be a single ontology concept, the task of assigning documents to each concept is straight forward. Each document is regarded as the textual representation of the corresponding concept.

When we are constructing the concept vectors, the first step is to clean and preprocess the html documents. The html, script tags, common structures such as menus etc. are stripped from the documents. This leaves us with clean text files. Since html tag-ging is mainly a layout formatting, authors are not always very good at writing grammatically correct pages with respect to the textual content, which hampers the results of the next step in the process, part-of-speech (POS) tagging. The solution we applied in the worst case could end up with e.g. entire tables as a single sentence. The POS tagging was performed by applying the
Stanford Tagger v1.6. 3 The POS tags were used as a filter to only keep the most interesting word constructs (phrases) and their gested by Justeson and Katz [16] . The patterns we have employed can be found in Table 1 , where N represents a noun (we do not differentiate between different types of nouns) and J is an adjective (also here we do not differentiate between words within the adjective class).

All phrases that were found to fulfill one of the tag patterns were added to the concept signatures. We did not perform any out a large number of high quality phrases. We decided that the benefit of keeping these good phrases was higher than the pen-tion to the phrases stemming from the tag patterns, we also kept single nouns that appear in more than two documents.
Next the phrases were split into single terms and all these were added to the concept signature (using the frequency of the ified that only nouns (single terms) should be added to the vector. The argumentation we use is that the adjectives present in a noun phrase are more important for the semantic description of the concept than other the signature.

To make sure that the signatures are containing only the most meaning bearing terms, we next remove the stop words (if any, since the POS-filtering should have removed a substantial portion). The final processing of the terms is to apply stemming using the Porter stemming algorithm [21] . This ensures that terms having the same general meaning are collapsed to a single term.
Finally, the weight of the terms are calculated based on the tf i in concept signature j , freq i , j is the frequency of term i in concept signature j , max term l in concept signature j , N is the number of concept signatures, and n term i .
To compute the set operations needed for Hypotheses 2  X  4 , we disregard the weight information for the terms and regard each vector as a set. The cosine similarity calculations were performed according to Eq. (1) . 6.2. Folksonomy hierarchy data and settings
We will in this section give the details on the hierarchy we have evaluated and on the construction of the tag vectors. The de-tails of the construction of the folksonomy hierarchy can be found together with a user evaluation of the hierarchy in Solskinns-full hierarchy created. The hierarchy was built based on folksonomy data crawled from Delicious between December 2009 and
January 2010. Our initial seed for the crawl was  X  wikipedia
Wikipedia. 4 This was done so that we could map the URLs onto pages from a Wikipedia dump which has already been cleaned and POS tagged (see [3] ). More details on the data can be found in [24] .

In [24] we set as a criterion that all trees (sub trees of the root node) should have a depth of at least 3 to have a reasonable number of relations for the users to evaluate. Our folksonomy hierarchy consists of 40 trees (below the root), out of which 31 had a depth of 3, 8 had a depth of 4 and one had a depth of 5. In this evaluation we do not evaluate the relations between the top of each of the trees and the root, since the root is introduced by us as a common ancestor on the top of the hierarchy and
The tag signatures for the tags that appeared in the hierarchy were built using the already mentioned Wikipedia dump. After the documents had been preprocessed (discussed later) we assigned to each tag signature all terms of the documents that had been tagged using the tag in question. We chose to alter the weight of the terms according to the number of times the document had been tagged, as we wanted to reflect how the tag has been applied to documents in the tag vector. This means that a docu-ment that has been tagged 10 times with tag t i should be more important than a document that has been tagged only 2 times with t . The basic weight of the terms in the tag signature was calculated according to Eq. (3) , where freq tag signature of tag j ,  X  j , r is the number of times tag j has been used to bookmark resource r , f source r , and R j is the set of resources tagged with tag j .
This initial signature is now a good internal representation of the tag (ref Section 4 ). However, we would also like the weight to reflect the external representation of the tag and therefore apply the tf in Eq. (2) , where wf i , j is the tfidf score for term i in the signature for tag j , freq We have for this evaluation run three types of preprocessing on the documents to see if and how this influences the result.
Recall that we are using a cleaned document set, so there is no need for removal of markup in the text (HTML). The first prepro-cessing is named Pre1 and is quite standard. This preprocessing consists of removing stop words, and stemming the terms with the Porter stemming algorithm [21] . The next preprocessing is called Pre2 and uses the POS tag information found in the
Wikipedia dump. First we extract all phrases found in the documents according to the patterns found in Table 1 (we also include single nouns). Next, the phrases are split, stop words are removed, and the terms are stemmed using the Porter stemming algo-terms in each phrase are stemmed using the Porter stemming algorithm to collapse the vocabulary somewhat. For each of these preprocessing methods we have also applied filtering terms based on the number of occurrences in the basic document set. This means that only terms occurring in between 2 and 50 documents are added to the signatures (to ensure that we get the most characteristic terms for each document). We have tested how these parameters affected the results on the cosine sim-ilarity among vectors and found that the settings did not influence the results in a negative way (see [24] ) for a more detailed description.

Quite a few of these vectors turned out to be a lot larger than the vectors of the ontology used in the original paper, so we found that we needed to trim the vectors. We opted for a maximum number of terms in each vector and did three different test runs, limiting the number of terms in the vectors to maximum 100, 250, and 500 terms. 7. Results
This section will present the results from our two evaluations. First we present the results from the evaluation presented in the original paper, followed by our findings from the current evaluation based on a hierarchy structure built from a folksonomy. Fi-nally we sum up and discuss our findings. 7.1. Ontology based results
The evaluation based on the ontology structure from the DNV web site consisted of running two tests (one for each data set, 2004 and 2008) for each of the four hypotheses. For each data set we only considered concepts which had two or more sub con-concepts. Please refer to the example from Section 5.1 for the notation used to describe the classes/vectors/sets.
First we look at the results for Hypothesis 1 which deals with the strength of super-sub relations in contrast to the sibling relations. The success criterion was specified to be sim ( S , U of 172 super-sub relations, while we for the 2008 data set analyzed 344 super-sub relations. The number of sibling relations an-alyzed was 744 for the 2004 data set and 1482 for the 2008 data set. The results, which are listed in Table 2 show that the mean cosine similarity between super and sub concepts is higher than the mean similarity between the siblings. This seems to support the hypothesis and we also see that there is agreement between the two data sets.

The next part of the evaluation concerns Hypothesis 2 which states that super concept and sub concept are different. The success criteria were for this hypothesis S  X  \ U  X  i  X  X  X  and U meaning that there is some partial overlap between the two and still both concepts seen to have their own specific semantics.
This can be interpreted as the super concept having semantics concerning more abstract parts of the concept, while the sub indicate a high degree of overlap. One could possibly say that the smaller the overlap, the closer the concepts are to each other. The optimal size of the result sets is still an open issue.

Next we look at the results for Hypothesis 3 , which is concerned with whether commonalities among the sub concepts are defined by their super concept. The success criterion specified for this hypothesis was ( evaluation are listed as Table 4 and they show that this indeed seems to be the case. For the 2004 data set we found 18 out of 26 empty result sets, while we for the 2008 data set found 28 out of 60 empty result sets. We also note that the mean size of the result sets is query low for both data sets, 0.7 and 3.7 for the 2004 set and 2008 set, respectively. This suggests that we have found some common core among the sub concepts that seem to be traceable to the common ancestor, the super concept.
The final part of the evaluation was Hypothesis 4 , stating that the super concept is represented at a higher abstraction level, using terminology that is not directly applicable to the sub concept. The success criteria were specified to be S the semantics of the super concept can be split in two; one general (abstract) part most appropriate for the higher level and one more specific part that is also shared with the lower level (the sub concepts). 7.2. Folksonomy hierarchy based results
In this section we will present the results from our current evaluation using the folksonomy hierarchy we have built. Our eval-cut-off points (100 terms, 250 terms, and 500 terms).

First we look at the results for Hypothesis 1 which focuses on the strength of the sub-super relation in contrast to the sibling relations. In the hypothesis we defined the success criteria to be sim ( S , U 65 parent tags and we examined the cosine similarity between each parent tag and its child tags, totaling 237 relations. We also runs the mean similarity between the parent tags and the child concepts is higher than the mean similarity between the child the similarity scores is relatively high. It may mean that the hierarchy is not optimal from an ontological perspective in some
To improve readability of the graphs we have averaged the scores in two different ways. In Fig. 2 we have calculated the average sing technique over the three signature lengths. As seen from these graphs the trend is quite clear, the percentage of relations within a given similarity range is higher for the hierarchy relations than for the sibling relations with exception to the lowest and the two highest similarity ranges.

Table 7 shows the results for the part of the evaluation concerning Hypothesis 2 , which states that parent tag and sub tag are different. The success criteria were specified to be S  X  \ U hypothesis. The result sets seem to point towards a general overlap of approximately 25 stable over all nine tests.

The results for Hypothesis 3 which concerns whether commonalities among the child tags are defined by their parent tag are shown as Table 8 . The success criterion for this hypothesis was specified to be ( the case for our folksonomy hierarchy also, since we have a large number of empty result sets. However, these empty results are of empty child intersections may be caused by the child sets not being located at the correct depth in the hierarchy. Even though should be moved one level down in the hierarchy with a new common parent inserted at the original level of the children. This means that our results for Hypothesis 3 are not as clear as they were for the previous evaluation and we cannot give a final conclusion.
 criteria was defined as S  X  \(  X  i =1 n U  X  i )  X  X  X  and | S after subtracting the union of the child tags' sets. This means that the parent tag contains some semantics that is not contained by the child tags. This finding agrees well with the first success criterion.

The results presented for Hypotheses 3 and 4 both show a tendency towards high standard deviations. In our opinion this is largely caused by the general nature of the measurements we have made. As we have a varying number of child tags it is natural that this will influence the size of the resulting sets (both with respect to union and intersect). 7.3. Summary
Our findings from the current evaluation largely agree with the findings from the original evaluation. For both evaluations we is needed for this measure when applied to a new data set for a certain confirmation/rejection of parts of the structure.
The results for Hypothesis 2 seem to be in agreement for both the original and the current evaluation. However, quantifying be used as an indicator towards the tightness of the connection between the concepts. Large overlaps can indicate that concepts are very close in  X  vertical distance  X  while small overlaps may signal that the a missing concept in between.

The findings for Hypothesis 3 seem to be confirmed in the original evaluation, while the results for the current evaluation based on the folksonomy hierarchy were not as supportive. This may have several reasons, such as the general background for the folksonomy hierarchy. It may be the case that we are missing pieces of the hierarchy that would have been there if con-structed by a human. For example there may have been tags that belonged at a lower level, but we were not able to recognize that there should have been a tag level between the parent and its children. In many ways one can say that the hierarchy still is correct, only that some detail is lost in the hierarchy.

Finally we note that the results from Hypothesis 4 seem to agree for both data sets, with only a single empty result set in both the 2004 and 2008 data set and no empty result sets for the folksonomy based evaluation.

Our findings through these two evaluations are mainly that the vector and set representations can be used to measure the cor-rectness of the hierarchies. Some of the challenges one is faced with when applying the procedure is how to interpret the numeric to see that most of the results are displaying similar trends.

 size before performing the evaluation. That we have managed to reproduce the results (with exception to Hypothesis 3 ) shows that our approach to hierarchy evaluation works. The slight differences we found between the DNV and the folksonomy data sets may imply that the folksonomy structure has some imperfections from an ontological viewpoint. This may be caused by the way people apply tags and is therefore reflected in the structure.

Conclusion In this paper we have presented an approach that describes properties that point towards quality in hierarchical structures. From the ontology based evaluation (using two data sets from the DNV ontology which defines the structure of the DNV web site) we were able to confirm our hypotheses. In the evaluation using the folksonomy hierarchy built according to [24] we were (using the semantic concept/tag signatures) between hierarchically related concepts/tags is higher than the corresponding cosine of super concepts/tags and its children while they still retain some similarity. This can be interpreted as the super concept/tag having a broader definition, carrying a vocabulary more suited for the higher level of abstraction, while the sub class has a more detailed vocabulary suited for the lower level abstraction level. Taking this into account, concepts/tags which have a high degree of overlap are possibly not suitable candidates for the subsumption relation.

In the data set for the DNV case we found evidence that the commonalities between the sub concept defines a common set that can be found in the super class. Not finding this commonality, both in the super concept and also among the sub concepts (interpreted as an empty intersection), may signal that we are dealing with an inappropriate ontological subsumption relation, or that we are dealing with concepts that should be even further down the hierarchy (e.g. a missing concept between the super and sub concept(s)). Finally we found that the super concept/tag and the sub concepts/tags partially overlap semantically. sub classes), while the sub classes contain one part that reflects its more detailed nature.
