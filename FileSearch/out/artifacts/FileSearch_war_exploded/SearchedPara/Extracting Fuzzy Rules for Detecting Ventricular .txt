 Detecting of cardiac rhythm abnormalities ar e based on adaptive decision support tool and analysis of time series of the electrocardiograms (ECG). Support vector machines (SVM) and fuzzy neural networks (FNN) can be effectively used for this type of tool normal behavior, the Wavelet Transforms (WT) as filtering process is needed. Fibrillation (VF), the most dangerous type of heart arrhythmia. The VF is represented by fast rhythm, abnormal and ineffective contractions of the ventricles and it finishes death. The survival probability for a human who has a VF attack outside the hospital ranges between 2-25% [5]. 
In this paper, six input features are obtained from two steps. In the first step, ECG space reconstruction (PSR) method which is based on detail coefficients d3 at level 3, can be generated which are the input data of NEWFM. 
Amann used filtering transformed and the threshold d 0 by PSR algorithm, as char-acteristic features for VF classification with 85.1% of VF classification accuracy [6]. This paper is shown that the 6 generalized features are extracted on the data sets used by Creighton University Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia Data Base (CUDB) with reli-able accuracy and specificity rates of 90.4% and 93.3%, respectively. 2.1 Wavelet Transform In this paper, the Haar wavelet function is used as a mother wavelet. Detail 256 coef-may have an influence on the extracting characteristics of ECG signal. The sampling size of the window of ECG signals from the 250 Hz CUDB is 8s. 2.2 Extraction Input Features The phase space reconstruction (PSR) method is based on reconstruct the phase space ing a measure d is defined by formula (1): [6] 
Fig. 1 shows typical NSR, VF, VT 8s episodes from the CUDB and these signals by wavelet transform are illustrated in Fig. 2 and the corresponding phase space plot boxes in this paper. The d value is used as the NEWFM first input feature. Fig. 4. values, then select 4 coefficients (b1, b2, b3, b4) before first 3 maximum peaks, and mum peaks of the NSR sample detail coefficients d3 are recognized. And then selects 4 coefficients (b1, b2, b3, b4) before the maximum peak. 3.1 The Structure of NEWFM Neural network with weighted fuzzy membership function (NEWFM) is a supervised classification neuro-fuzzy system using bounded sum of weighted fuzzy membership comprises three layers namely input, hyperbox, and class layer. The input layer con-class node is connected to one or more hyperbox nodes. An h th. Input pattern can be and A h is n features of an input pattern. input I h with class i and w li = 1. 3.2 Learning Scheme has three weighted fuzzy membership functions (WFM, grey triangles in Fig. 7) which randomly constructed before learning. Each the original membership function an i th feature value of an input pattern A h for i features to the hyperbox B l , output of the B l is obtained by formula (3) bership function weight of .

The graphs in Fig. 9 are the BSWFMs of the six input features: the 1st feature is d value, 2nd feature is peaks number, 3rd-6th features which are coefficients average of front side of the maximum peak with detail coefficients d3. The solid lines and dotted the features to interpret explicitly. 
Table 1 shows the data set used to evaluate the performance of the NEWFM model 90.36%, respectively. The BSWFMs of the six features trained by NEWFM are shown visually, which makes the features interpret explicitly. Since each BSWFM combines multiple sized BSWFMs can realize real-time NSR, VT/VF detection in mobile environment. These algorithms are pivotal component in Automated External Defibrillators (AED).
