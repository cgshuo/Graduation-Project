 1. Introduction
Piles have been widely used as foundation for various impor-tant infrastructures such as tall buildings, bridges, wind farms, etc. One of major functions of pile foundation is to transmit loading from the superstructure to the subsurface through shaft friction and end bearing. As a serviceability requirement, the pile head settlement shall not exceed the design level. Therefore, a reliable estimation of pile head settlement is essential for the design of pile foundations. The problems posing a considerable challenge to accurate prediction of load X  X ettlement behaviour of piles are the complicated nature of load transfer mechanism, involving the inter-related displacement of pile and surrounding soil, the uncertainty with regard to soil properties due to sample disturbance during material testing and the inevitable modifica-This constitutes a serious handicap particularly to more rigorous computational models like non-linear finite element analysis. Poulos (1977) observed that the suitably accurate information about the soil and soil X  X ile interface for FEM analysis may be problems. Relatively simple methods such as elastic solutions and hyperbolic models can rely on correlations with in-situ tests for estimating the relevant soil parameters used in settlement analysis. However, the assumption of linear deformation beha-viour of soil in the case of elastic method is overly simplistic ( Desai, 1977 ) and is limited to very low strain levels where the of hyperbolic models, though in agreement with general con-sensus that soil is a non-linear geo-material, the constants of a single hyperbolic equation are too few to adequately represent the complex behaviour of load transfer along the pile shaft for various types of soil ( Poskitt, 1993 ).

Pile loading tests have been the most reliable means of foundations. However, the cost makes it infeasible to be carried out at every design stage apart from very important construc-tions. Development of a reliable correlation between pile loading practicing engineers, because it will provide them with a model based on simple tests and serving dual purpose of stability and serviceability analysis.

Unlike the conventional methods such as elastic approxima-tion ( Vesic, 1977; Vijayvergiya, 1977; Poulos and Davis, 1980;
Randolph and Wroth, 1978; Fleming et al., 1992 ), hyperbolic neural networks (NN) are non-mechanistic models ( Jaksa et al., 2008 ) which are solely based on the observed experimental data.
Their ability to acquire knowledge through interaction (learning), makes them quite suitable for exploring correlations from such a very noisy and imprecise information as in-situ soil test and pile loading test data. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been successfully applied to a wide variety of geotechnical problems such as geo-material modelling ( Ellis et al., 1995; Penumadu and
Jean-Lou, 1997; Basheer and Najjar, 1998 ), soil liquefaction problems ( Agrawal et al., 1997; Ural and Saka, 1998 ), prediction of pile capacity ( Goh, 1995, 1996; Chan et al., 1995; Teh et al., 1997; Lee and Lee, 1996; Nawari et al., 1999; Das and Basudhar, 2006 ). Shahin et al. (2002) developed a BPN model for predicting shallow foundation settlement using SPT blow counts as repre-(2009) used a BPN network to correlate between pile head settlement and SPT blow counts of soil around the pile.
The successes of the aforementio ned investigations strengthen the position of neural networks as alternative numerical methods of propagation network (BPN) is the most widely used model for geotechnical engineering problems. This is due to the simplicity of learning rule used in training the network and the stability of sigmoid transfer function, which is used as activation function.
Despite their popularity, BPN networks are not devoid of problems; the sigmoid transfer function is a bi-asymptotic one and becomes
This severely limits the ability of the network to make reasonable extrapolations. One of the solutions to the said problem is to use non-asymptotic processing elem ents such as high-order neurons.
High-order neural networks use polynomial functions to map inputs into output and can be trained t hrough error back-propagation algorithm. They have successfully been applied in pattern recogni-been applied in geotechnical modelling.

In this study, HON-PILE, a high-order neural network model for the simulation of load X  X ettlement behaviour is developed. The model predicts the relationship between the pile head settlement and the magnitude of axial loading exerted on the pile given the geometric parameters and elastic modulus of pile and the proper-ties of foundation soil, represented by the standard penetration test blow counts (SPT-N). A comprehensive comparison between the proposed HON model, BPN and the elastic approximation and hyperbolic model will be performed. The relative performance of
HON will also be determined in comparison with other poly-nomial regression, RBF and GRNN networks. 2. Existing pile load X  X ettlement models
In this section, the currently used methods of predicting pile settlement, including elastic hyperbolic, step integration and FEM methods will be outlined. 2.1. Elastic models
Elastic models are based on Mindlin equations for the dis-layer. They are also based on the assumption that the pile is acted upon by a system of uniform shear stress around its shaft, while the base is acted upon by a uniform pressure. Elastic solutions are severely limited to circumstances where the simple linear soil behaviour can be considered adequate. The most popular elastic solution was developed by Poulos and Davis (1980) and can be expressed as follows: s  X  P
E rigid pile in a deep layer, for a Poisson X  X  ratio of 0.5; R end bearing; s is the immediate settlement; E s the elastic modulus of soil along the pile shaft and D b stands for the diameter of the pile base.

Other methods based on elastic solution were developed by Vesic (1977) , Randolph and Wroth (1978) and Fleming et al. (1992) . Elastic solutions are severely limited to circumstances where the simple linear soil behaviour can be considered adequate. 2.2. Hyperbolic models
In this approach, the pile head settlement is related to the pile head load using a hyperbolic model. It is an attempt to represent the non-linear behaviour of soil-shaft and soil-base interaction using relatively simple model. The method was first described by Chin (1970) and later improved by Fleming (1992) to treat the components of shaft and base resistances separately. According to Fleming (1992) , the pile load and the pile head settlement are related as follows:
P  X  c  X  D t  X  in which P t and D t represent the pile load and pile head settle-ments, respectively, while a  X  U s , b  X  D B E B U B , c  X  MsD resistance, ultimate base resistance, pile base diameter, soil deformation soil modulus at the pile base and flexibility factor, respectively. The method tends to yield better results than elastic methods. However, the assumption of hyperbolic stress X  X train relationship is not applicable to all circumstances. Furthermore, there is no established correlation between the hyperbolic para-meters and in-situ (SPT) tests, and one has to rely on correlations between SPT and soil parameters, which are unreliable. 2.3. Step integration methods
Step integration approach was developed by Coyle and Reese (1966) . In this approach, shear-deformation relation for the soil X  pile interface is modelled using series of independent non-linear curves known as t  X  z curves. The base pressure versus deformation is represented by another non-linear model known as q  X  y curve.
The soil X  X ile system is simulated in this method as series of incompressible weights connected by weightless springs to represent the pile and side springs attached to the weights to the bottom most weight, another spring is attached to represent base resistance described by q  X  y curve. The problem is then solved either using finite difference or one-dimensional finite element method. The major challenge in step integration method is the determination of parameters defining t  X  z and q  X  y curves.
Various attempts have been made to develop an empirical correlation between the curve parameters and in-situ tests ( Chang and Broms, 1991, Tan et al., 1998; Balakrishnan et al, 1999 ). However, high scatter undermines the reliability of the correlations. Their inability to develop a good correlation is not unconnected to the data size, the noise associated with the data and, possibly due to limitations of the regression models used. 2.4. Finite element method
Finite element method is the most rigorous technique used in the prediction of pile head settlement. Although more computa-versatile as it can handle complex geometries such as spatial variation of soil continuum. It also can conveniently handle non-linear material behaviour. The analysis involves discrediting both the pile and the supporting soil into finite elements. In compli-ance with equilibrium, compatibility and boundary conditions, displacements can be determined by solving a system of equa-tions derived from the geometry and material behaviour of finite elements. The accuracy and reliability of FEM model depends on the selection of material constitutive model to describe the behaviour of the soil elements and the soil X  X ile interface. Simple models such linearly elastic or elastic X  X lastic models, which complicated more accurate models such as require many para-meters that are difficult to determine ( Scott, 1988 ).
Even more difficult to predict is the behaviour of the soil X  X ile interface. Lee and Salgado (1999) , in the absence of simple and reliable means of measuring the properties of the soil X  X ile inter-face, used linear model to represent pre-failure regime and coulomb failure model to account for slip at the interface and assumed the friction and adhesion factors of unity. The uncer-tainty with regards to parameter estimation and the effects of pile installation, which are difficult to take into consideration in FE analysis, tend to undermine performance of the powerful method in comparison with less rigorous methods. 3. Neural network model (HON-PILE model)
Neural networks are computational models capable of carrying out complex input X  X utput mapping. They are based on the information processing infrastructure of the biological brain. The structure of ANN is a highly simplified model of biological neural architecture. The computational simplicity of the proces-sing elements makes the network much easier to handle than rigorous mechanistic computational methods. The ability of neural networks to perform accurate modelling of complex systems lies in the interconnection between various neurons in the network. The model of artificial neuron was first proposed by McCulloch and Pitts (1943) . However, artificial neural net-works did not attract lots of attention until the development of back-propagation algorithm for artificial neurons ( Rumelhart et al., 1986 ). Since then, a significant amount of research has been done on their improvement and their application to various aspects across many disciplines. The most widely used neural network is the back-propagation neural network (BPN), which uses sigmoid function in processing input signals and back-propagation algorithm in prediction error correction. BPN has a superior function approximation capability than radial basis function network (RBN), which has a superior capability in pattern classification ( Haykin, 1999 ). The performance of BPN was found to be comparable to more complicated neuro-fuzzy Bateni et al., 2007 ). However, the downside of BPN is the limited dynamic range of sigmoid function, which, at times, makes it necessary to use large number of neurons to achieve the desired accuracy. High-order networks are alternative neural network types with a trainable activation function and a capability of achieving desired accuracy with a smaller network size ( Ismail neural networks in simulating the load X  X ettlement behaviour of pile is investigated. 3.1. High-order networks
High-order neural network uses high-order neurons instead of summation units like sigmoid neurons as processing elements.
Unlike summation units where the net input signal is a weighted sum of the inputs fed into that unit, high-order units process the products of the inputs they receive. HON provides an alternative to conventional networks, with the advantages of increased information capacity and reduced number of processing elements ability to form higher-order combinations of inputs ( Durbin and
Rumelhart, 1989 ). The type of high-order neuron used here is based on the HONEST model proposed by Abdelbar and Tagliarini (1996) with slight modification.
 The mathematical model of the neuron is:
O  X  w j ( Fig. 1 ), and the synaptic weight of i X  X  link, respectively. x input from node i.

The advantage of high-order neurons over sigmoid neurons is that the input and output parameters do not have to be normal-ized within certain range. This is due to the fact that HON models are not asymptotic and do not have a limited dynamic range.
Another advantage of HON is transparency. While other types of network are criticized of operating on the principles of black box, the strength of relationship between various inputs and the output in HON is easier to appreciate. Due to its polynomial nature, HON bears some similarities with group method of data handling (GMDH) models, which, in theory, can approximate any continuous function ( Ivakhnenko, 1971 ). GMDH algorithm involves determining the coefficients of the Kolmogorov X  X abor polynomial expressed by y  X  a o  X  a , y } is the vector of coefficients. The advantage of HON network over GMDH models is that HON can assume real valued exponents and is capable of undergoing a gradual training like
BPN and RBF networks. In this study, the HON network is trained using gradient decent algorithm. 3.2. Development of HON-PILE
Development of neural networks involves not only optimizing the training but also the architecture. The most challenging aspect of topology development is the control of the size of the network.
Too many neurons will lead to redundancy of some connections slow training process and lack of generalization. On the other hand, using insufficient neurons will lead to inability of the network to extract the necessary information from the network.
There are various methods of developing best architecture ( Haykin, 1999 ). In this study, bottom-to-top approach is used, based on incremental learning algorithm proposed by Bahi et al. (2009) . Starting with a small network, the size is gradually increased as the training progresses. When a hidden layer is added it starts with a single linear node. High-order nodes are then monotonically added to the layer as the training progresses until the convergence is obtained.

Based on the number of inputs and predicted parameters, two types of high-order networks were developed. Type I model predicts the pile head settlement, while type II model predicts the pile head load. The initial topology of type I model was initialized with four input nodes, one hidden layer with four nodes and an output layer with one node (4-4-1). In the course of training, the two hidden layers, with three neurons in each, are added into the network and the resulting configuration becomes 4-4-3-3-1. At each increment, the network is trained until no further improvement in error reduction. The first hidden layer of the optimized network consists of linear neurons for the purpose of summing up the stifnessses of soil along the shaft and the base, and that of the pile. The second and third hidden layers consist of high-order networks with three neurons in each layer, while the output layer consists of single linear neuron. Alongside the type I
HON model, a BPN with 4-8-3-1 configuration was developed for the sake of comparison. Type II HON model consists of 14 input nodes, six hidden nodes in the first hidden layer and one output layer (14-6-1) at the initial stage. Second hidden layer is then introduced in the course of training and the number of nodes thereof is gradually increased from 0 to 5 the final configuration at the end of training session is 14-6-5-1. RBF (with 15 Gaussian nodes) and GRNN networks are trained together with HON type II model for assessment of relative performance.

The database used for training and testing the models consists bored piles with over 900 data points. The pile data is drawn from the sources given in Table 1 . The detailed information of database are provided in a spread sheet that is available from the authors and journal, upon request. All piles in the database are concrete cylindrical piles. The methods of installation include impact driving in the case of driven piles and wet and dry excavations in the case of bored piles. The range of pile diameters and lengths are from 0.3 to 0.8 and 6 to 30 m, respectively. The elastic moduli of the piles range from 2.19 10 7 to 3.44 10 7 kN/m 2 . The soil test results in the database consist of soil classification and uncorrected SPT-N values determined at 1.5 X 3 m intervals and soil classification. The rationale behind the use of uncorrected values in this study is that they reflect the variation of over-burden stress, which in turn affects shaft and base resistance in coarse soils. The soil classification serves as additional informa-tion for a better characterisation of the foundation soil. The soil types in the database range from coarse soils (sand) to fine soils (silt and clay), with coarse soil being predominant. BPN and HON type I model were developed based on driven piles only, while type II HON was trained to predict the behaviour of both driven and bored piles. 3.2.1. Input variables
The ability of ANN to make a reasonable prediction depends largely on the choice of input parameters. A good understanding therefore crucial to development of a reliable network. Based on traditional methods of predicting pile settlement such as Poulos and Davis (1980) and Vesic (1977) , the parameters the controlling the shaft and at the pile base. The pile stiffness is a function of pile geometry and material property of the pile, while the soil resistance is a function of soil deformation modulus, which is estimated from in-situ or laboratory tests. In this study, SPT-N is chosen to represent the soil stiffness. SPT is the most widely used less accurate compared to other in-situ tests, it gives a good idea about strength ad deformability of geo-materials ( Prevost and
Popescu, 1996 ). A number of empirical correlations between deformation modulus of soil and SPT-N values are reported in ment as a non-linear function of related variables can be written as s  X  f  X  P , k s , E p , D , L  X  X  5  X  pile diameter and pile length, respectively. The unknown function installation response of the soil X  X ile system to loading. The load X  settlement curve can also be modelled with pile load as the dependant parameter. Eq. (12) below expresses pile head load as a function of settlement, and soil and pile properties: P  X  f 0  X  s , k s , E p , D , L  X  X  6  X 
The function f 0 ( ) is the inverse of the settlement function. The resistance around the pile, which can be expressed in terms of SPT as follows: k  X  f  X  N s , N b  X  X  7  X  in which N s and N b are the SPT-N along the shaft and at the base, respectively.

To account for variation of N -value along the shaft, the pile is divided into five segments. The weighted average value of N over the length of each segment is determined by N l
Other factors considered are the soil type and method of installation. The settlement function in Eq. (11) is approximated using BPN and HON type I as s NN  X  NN P , N s A s , N b A b ,
The NN approximated load function by HON type II is expressed by P
NN  X  NN s , N s where N s is the average value of N over the shaft length, denoted by
N  X 
The term E p A b / L stands for the pile stiffness.  X  N s of the product of average N -values along the shaft segments and the corresponding shaft area, respectively. It is expressed as
Predicted settlemet (mm) 20 40 60 80 100 120
Predicted settlement (mm) Predicted settlement (mm) 20 40 60 80 100 120 Predicted settlement (mm) follows:
N styp and ptyp stand for soil type and method of pile installation.
Soil type is represented by the percentage particle size, which are approximately deduced from soil classification. The approximate values so generated will then serve as inputs to the network four nodes are dedicated for the approximate values of sand, silt and clay percentages. The fourth node is assigned to plasticity index.
Method of installation is represented by two nodes. For a particular type of pile the appropriate node (or nodes) will fire a are disabled, when it is bored then one node is switched on. The second node is activated to fire a value of 1.0 when the bored pile is installed by dry excavation. The input parameters to the network include the pile head settlement; s , pile stiffness; E
Others include six parameters to represent soil resistance;  X  N and N b A b , percentage of sand, silt and clay and three input parameters to represent method of pile installation (driving, wet excavation and dry excavation). The input parameters used in different models (BPN and HON) is summarized in Table 2 . 3.2.2. Networks training and validation
The pile load test data was partitioned into training and validation data, with the former being used to develop the network. The latter was used to verify the predictive quality of the trained model. 79% of the database was used for training, while the remaining 21% of the data was used for testing the network prediction. The training data is, as much as possible, made to capture the widest variations in input and output patterns in the database. This is to avoid having extreme data in the testing set, which could make it impossible to assess the true generalization capability of the model within the domain of the training data as in the case of completely randomized selection ( Shahin et al., 2004 ).

The synaptic weights were initialized uniformly distributed random numbers in both networks, while learning parameters of 0.01 and 0.1 were used in the training of HON and BPN, respectively. Offline training was used in the case of HON while the BPN was trained using online method. The exponents of HON model are restricted to a range of 3.0 to 3.0.

The training was terminated when no further improvement in the quality of prediction in comparison with the test data is observed. Termina-tion of training at this juncture is necessary in order to prevent over-learning and loss of generalization. After termination of the training, the network simulations were compared with the test data, which is not part of the training. The assessment parameters in both training and testing are the roots mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ).
 The root mean square error is defined as follows: RMSE  X 
The coefficient of determination R is a measure of scatter or lack of it between two sets of data. It is given by R  X  in which y m and y p are measured and predicted parameters, respectively.

Tables 3 and 4 summarize the training and testing results for settlement and load functions, respectively. 3.3. Comparisons
The ability of ANN to adapt to learning is measured by the level of agreement between the training data and the network output, while the quality of the network X  X  prediction is gauged by the comparing the testing data and the network predictions. In
Fig. 2 (a) and (b), the BPN network outputs are compared with training and testing data, respectively. The HON simulations are compared with the training and testing data in Fig. 2 (c) and (d), respectively. The high-order network, compared to the BPN, correlate better with the training data ( R 2  X  0.91 for HON and type I model exceeds that of BPN. The R 2 values of 0.87 and 0.78 for type I HON and BPN, respectively, point to the better predic-tion of HON compared to BPN. It is however noted that at settlement levels of 40 mm or less, the correlation is rather poor in both HON type I and BPN.

The predictions of type II HON model are compared with training and testing data in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), respectively. The strong correlation between HON predictions and duo of training by the network and the high quality of prediction the network is capable of doing. Also, by comparing the scattergrams of HON be rightly said that the former remarkably out performs the latter. Results of HON type II model ( R 2 and RMSE) are compared with four different models in Table 4 . The models used in the comparison include Fleming X  X  hyperbolic model, multivariate polynomial regression model, RBF network and GRNN model.
From the summary of results, the HON type II has the best performance ( R 2  X  0.890), followed by RBF network ( R 2
The polynomial regression model and hyperbolic model are at the bottom of the performance list with the later having the least prediction quality among the other models based on the testing predicted by HON type II, the simulations are compared with a selected pile loading test from training data in Fig. 5 and with a loading test from testing data in Fig. 6 . Both Figs. 5 and 6 indicated that HON simulations correlate well with field mea-surements. A further comparison of type II HON, elastic and hyperbolic models were also made against the measured values closest estimate of settlement and therefore most accurate. Load (kN) Load (kN) 3.4. Parametric study and sensitivity analysis
The results of parametric study carried out to assess the generalization ability of HON type II model are presented in
Fig. 8 (a) X (e). The approach used in the analysis is similar to the the subject of the analysis are re-fixed to the mean of training values while the subject parameter is allowed to vary between the minimum and maximum values used for model training. The response of the model to the variation of the single parameter is examined in the light of the current knowledge about the phenomenon. The analysis is then repeated with different con-trolling parameters.

Based on the results obtained, it is noticeable that there is a good agreement with the HON type II response and expected behaviour of piles when subjected to axial loading. The consistent decrease in the predicted pile head settlement (per unit load) with increment in pile length and stiffness in Fig. 8 (a) and (b) is indicative of the good agreement between the HON model and shaft area (a function of length and perimeter) and the resistance to compression is proportional to stiffness. The settlement is observed (in Fig. 8 (c)) to vary proportionally with slenderness agreement with the study carried out by Poulos (1977) .With regard to the behaviour of foundation soil, the average number of blows along the shaft varies inversely with settlement; although observed in the case SPT-N for the pile base ( Fig. 8 (e)).
Sensitivity analysis has also been carried out to see how strongly various input parameters affect the HON output. To test a particular parameter, its values are taken away from the input vector and the performance of the model is evaluated. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 5 . It can be seen that all input parameters considered in this model significantly affect the quality of HON prediction. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.2 Settlement per unit load (mm/kN) 0.5 0.52 0.54 0.56 0.58 0.6 10 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 Settlement per unit load (mm/kN) 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 0 Settlement per unit load (mm/kN) 4. Conclusions
Due to the complexity of soil X  X ile interaction and the soil disturbance during sampling and pile installation, the conven-tional methods of predicting pile load X  X ettlement relationship to simulate the pile load X  X ettlement curve using simple input data is proposed. The input data consist of the average value of SPT along the pile shaft, the SPT value at the pile base, the pile stiffness, the shaft and base area, and the pile load. Other parameters include soil type and installation method. Based on the coefficient of determination and root mean squared error, as well as the quality of load X  X ettlement curves, a significant improvement was observed from the comparison of HON results with BPN, elastic and hyperbolic models. The proposed model was also found to be more accurate in prediction than RBF, GRNN and polynomial regression. Also, based on the parametric study carried out, the HON model was found to respond reasonably well to various input parameters in a manner consistent with the anticipated behaviour of an axially loaded pile.
