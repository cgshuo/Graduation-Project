The emergence of molecular medicine and the completion of the human genome project provide more opportunity to discover unknown target proteins of drugs. The great advancement and improvements in science and technology over the past few decades have revealed tremendous information related to the human body and produced vast knowledge of the biological structures. Unfortunately, the number of diseases affecting the human body is rapidly increasing; and with the increase in disease discovery and the slow rate of drug discovery, there is a need for dedicated research that will improve drug design and contribute to more controlled handling (and hopefully elimination) of newer and older diseases, e.g. [8, 10,21]. There is so much information to consider: such as the structures and behavior of body molecules and the structures and behavior of external agents that interact with body molecules, i.e., drugs (see Fig. 1). From such information we can build networks of en tities that are in teracting with each other and that are signi fi cant in drug and drug target discovery.
Protein-ligand interactions play a central role in biochemical reactions, and understanding this is an important task in drug development process. How exactly the drug targets a protein is a challenging problem. Identifying putative motifs or grooves in the protein structure helps to understand the mecha-nism on drug-protein interactions. Thus, by building a drug-protein network, we can analyze the proteins targeted by certain drug or group of drugs based on the structure of both drugs and proteins. This is of extreme importance as most drugs have overlapped targets; though there are different drugs but they target similar motifs. Our work would help to change the fl ow of the drug design to target new motifs, of course this would affect the ef fi cacy of the drug. In this work, we are trying to fi nd speci fi cbiomarkers in the structure of the protein to predict the ef fi cacy of the drug on it. This research will add more to change the trend of drug design to target new proteins that play role in a different pathway.
We argue that interactions could be better realized and analyzed as social network because the social network model is supported by a rich metrics to successfully and effectively tackle a wide range of applications which could be modeled as a network. Molecules might come together and establish more sophisticated networks than the social networks rel ated to humans. Investigating such possibility and studying such networks could reveal major issues that might in fl uence the way several diseases are treated. By utilizing t he social network met hodology, we form sets of e lements that inter act with each other and are connected by links that have a weight, which characterizes their strength, and possibly a direction which can indicate how one element has a larger effect on the other. The fi nal and most important step after building social network of those interactions, would be applying data mining techniques to classify the data and predict the behavior of future drugs and/or future targets based on the mining result, and consequently move towards more ef fi cient drug design. As a pre-processing step for building the social network, we fi rst analyze the protein networks as clusters targeted by set of drugs. In summary, we build a sophisticated framework that integrates data mining techniques and the social network methodology to analyze the data that re fl ects the interactions between drugs and proteins. We applied the proposed framework on the dataset described in Section 3. The results reported later in the paper demonstrate the applicability and effectivenes s of the proposed approach.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Related work is brie fl y covered in Section 2. The data utilized in this study is described in Section 3 . Section 4 presents the methodology and reports the results. Section 5 shows the protein network. Section 6 is conclusions.
 2. Related work
Drug-target prediction using information related to both the chemical and genomic spaces has attracted the attention of a number of researchers who have developed different machine learning and graph theory based approaches to tackle the problem, e.g. [5,8,10,13,15,16,20 X 22,25,26]. For instance, Jacob and Vert [13] proposed a support vector machine (SVM) based classi fi cation approach where the chemical and genomic spaces are encoded together by de fi ning a pairwise kernel for the SVM; however, compu-tationally this is a very expensive approach. Keiser et al. [15,16] proposed a method to predict targets of proteins; however, their approach does not bene fi t from the information in the protein domain. Li et al. [17] developed a computational framework to build disease-speci fi c drug-protein connectivity maps. They integrated gene/protein and drug connectivity information based on protein interaction networks and literature mining, without re quiring gene e xpression pro fi le information derived from drug pertur-bation experiments on disease samples. The approach proposed by Shoichet et al. [20] is based on the non-trivial modeling of 3D structure of the target protein. Yamanishi et al. [25] proposed an integrated bipartite graph based framework th at encapsulates the chemical and g enomic spaces together with the drug-protein interaction network into a pharmacological space. Bleakley and Yamanishi [6] proposed a bipartite local model by transforming edge-prediction problems into binary classi fi cation problems; it is very suitable for SVM model.

The mostsigni fi cantwork thathas in fl uenced ourwork presented in this paperis  X  X rug TargetNetwork X  as described in [26]. It is based on utilizing drug networks to make conclusions. Two networks were mainly created: a Drug Target (DT) network and a Target Protein (TP) network. The DT network is represented by a graph that consists of all known FDA drugs and their protein targets. In this network, a drug and a protein are connected directly by an edge if the protein is a known target of the drug. Two drugs are connected to each other (indirectly) if they share at least one target protein. On the other hand, the TP network consists of protein nodes only. Two proteins are connected if they are both targeted by at least one common drug. Analysis was done on the networks using distances between the drugs and their targets in the DT network, and between proteins in the TP network. Distances were measured to analyze the relationship between the two entities. In the TP network, clusters that contained closely related proteins were formed. The main causes of high interconnectedness between proteins are drugs that target multiple proteins.

The main results of this research showed the continuous discovery of mostly  X  X ollow on" drugs. Such drugs are the ones that target already targeted proteins. However, from the TP network, it was found that there is an evolution towards a more diverse set of targets, and that is shown by the isolated nodes in the TP network. This shows a slow improvement towards better drug design. It was also found that drugs target clustered regions in the human disease network. This emphasizes the similarity between drugs belonging to the same clusters in the human disease network; proteins can be linked to the drugs targeting them. One of the most signi fi cant fi ndings was that most drugs invented in the past are drugs that mostly act palliatively and not etiological. Palliative drugs are the ones that target the symptoms of a disease while etiology based drugs are the ones that target the actual cause of the disease. 3. The data set
The main dataset used to test the applicability of the research framework developed in this paper is the TP network obtained from the  X  X rug Target Network X  paper [26]. The network consists of proteins that are connected to each other if they are targeted by the same drug. The network includes 394 target proteins of which only 170 proteins are considered. The reason for this is the fact that only the 10 biggest clusters of the network were identi fi ed as needing further investigation because they have the strongest network ties. The dataset also includes all the drugs that target proteins in each of the clusters.
The DrugBank database [23] was used to obtain all the sequences of the proteins from the ten clusters considered in the study as well as the chemical formulas for all the drugs that are targeting proteins in each of those clusters. A drug targets a protein by binding to it and changing its biochemical and/or biophysical activities. A drug can target multiple (one or more) p roteins, and a protein can be targeted by multiple drugs. 4. Methodology &amp; results
In this section we show and describe the pipeline of the proposed framework to characterize drug-protein interactions. Figure 2 highlights the steps we followed to analyze the drug-target network from both structural and functional angles. We started with protein clusters; the clusters were formed based on drugs that target them. We only selected the clusters with high degree of connection. Proteins which did not have enough connections were eliminated from the analysis. We fi rst analyzed amino acid enrichment in the clusters to fi nd out if some amino acids are more enriched in particular clusters; this may lead to the fact that the drugs targeting the investigated cluster prefer certain amino acids. The aim is to fi nd amino acid  X  drug interactions network. The second part of drug-protein interaction characterization is to identify if proteins in the same cluster share a subsequence (motif) which might indicate that the drugs prefer certain subsequences. We analyzed the amino acids enrichment in the discovered motifs to discover if we get consistent results as in the fi rst part of the analysis. We also characterized the motifs by identifying the functional domains associated with them. This would further demonstrate if drugs prefer certain functional domains. Then, we queried the resulted motifs against the whole human proteome to identify new putative targets for the drugs targeting proteins in the cluster. The last part, which is mostly functional analysis of the interaction, is to fi nd the correlation among proteins in the same cluster in terms of negative charge correlation, pathway correlation and post-translational modi fi cation. Drugs might be effective when targeting the protein in its active form after post-translation. Thus, clusters which are enriched in certain chemical modi fi cation may lead to the fact that the drug prefers the modi fi cation. 4.1. Amino acid frequencies
Every protein consists ofa sequence ofamino acids attachedto eachotherby peptide groups. Therefore, every protein can be represented by a sequence of amino acids from the set of the twenty known amino acids.

We argue that one of the reasons a certain drug binds to a protein and targets it could be sub-sequences of the protein, which can be represented by the frequency of the amino acids. To test and con fi rm this hypothesis, we looked at the frequency of each protein in the dataset used in the testing. We obtained the frequencies of each of the 170 proteins in the given dataset using the DrugBank database [11] and the Gene Card database [12]; then we mined the sequences to fi nd the occurrences of each of those amino acids in the protein sequences. For every protein, we fi nd the frequency of each of the 20 amino acids in the protein. Since our main goal here is to identify characteristics of the proteins and the drugs targeting them, and since proteins have different sizes and clusters have different number of proteins, it is essential to normalize the frequency of the amino acids. We proposed a normalization method to deal with these variables.
 The frequency of amino acid A in cluster n is calculated as follow: where O A is the observed number of amino acid ( A ) occurrences in the sequence of a protein P i ; E A is the expected number of amino acid ( A ) occurrences in the sequence of a protein P i ; it is computed as the length of the sequence divided by the number of amino acids; | P i | is the length of the i th protein sequence; C n is the size of the n th cluster and m is the number of proteins in the n th cluster. The size of C n does not depend on any similarity matrix; it depends on how much the proteins in the cluster share drugs.
 The result is a 10  X  20 matrix of the normalized frequencies of all the amino acids in each cluster. The normalized frequencies of the 20 amino acids in the 10 clusters are reported in Figure 3; and the frequency of the amino acids in the 10 clusters are given in Fig. 4).

The calculated normalized frequencies represent the frequency of each amino acid a in each cluster c compared to: 1) the frequency of all the other amino acids in cluster c , and 2) the frequency of amino acid a in the other clusters. However, in fact this data does not tell us much about whether these normalized frequencies are signi fi cant compared to other frequencies in the matrix. To get more information, the z-score of each frequency is computed as follows. where x isarawscoretobestandardized;  X  is the mean of the population; and  X  is the standard deviation of the population.

For every frequency, two z -score values are calculated; we call them the horizontal z -score ( X -z -score) and the vertical z -score ( Y -z -score), respectively. The X -z -score of each frequency is to fi nd the signi fi cance of the frequency among the frequencies of all the other amino acids in the same cluster. On the other hand, the Y -z -score represents the signi fi cance of the amino acid frequency among its frequency in the other clusters. It is important to take into consideration both the X and Y components because certain factors can affect the frequency of amino acids. For example, certain amino acids exist with high frequencies in nature. Our goal here is to fi nd amino acids highly represented in one cluster.
For each normalized frequency in the matrix, a point is formed where the corresponding X -z -score is the x-coordinate and the corresponding Y -z -score is the y-coordinate. After plotting these points on a graph as shown in Fig. 5, we will get a visual representation of these z-score values which will give us a better idea of what frequencies are important to use compared to the rest.

Fromthe graph plotted in Fig. 5, points with high positive y-values are the ones thatindicate signi fi cance in the amino acid frequency across the clusters. On the other hand, points with high positive x-values specify signi fi cance in the amino acid frequency in a particular cluster compared to other amino acids in the cluster.

Given that we are interested to see whether the drugs targeting a certain cluster can be linked to the (frequent) amino acids in the cluster, we are mostly interested in the points with higher y -values. Accordingly, a cut-off value is chosen as the minimum y -value for the points we need to consider from the graph. This cut-off value is chosen as 1. Figure 6 shows the selected points with their corresponding amino acids and the clusters they belong to.

From Fig. 6, we can also see that only few clusters are characterized by a high frequency of certain amino acids. So using the dataset which provides us with each set of drugs that target each cluster, we can make a hypothesis about what drugs target which a mino acids. And from that, we create a bipartite graph to re fl ect the amino acid and drug relationship such that a drug can target multiple amino acids, and an amino acid can be targeted by multiple drugs. Figure 7 shows a section of this bipartite graph.
In the entire bipartite graph created, amino acid A is connected to drugs targeting cluster 3. Since A is highly occurring in cluster 3 as shown in Fig. 6 and not in other clusters, we argue that A is the target of the drugs that target cluster 3 and not the other drugs that target other clusters; however, all the drugs connected to amino acid A will also target other amino acids such as V , D , W , etc. Cluster 3 contains signi fi cant amounts of each of these proteins; therefore, the drugs targeting cluster 3 could be possibly related to the highly frequent amino acids contained in cluster 3. 4.2. Motifs discovery and functional analysis
Motifs are common subsequences among a set of sequences; it is a sub-sequence pattern that occurs frequently in a group of related protein or DNA sequences. Motif discovery has received considerable attention as evident by the large number of related approaches described in the literature, e.g. [14]. Different statistics and machine learning techniques have been successfully adapted to the motif discovery process, including clustering [19], regression, joint probability, genetic algorithms, hidden Markov model, etc. We have already developed a novel approach for handling motifs [1].

We previously looked at the fre quency of amino acids c onstituting prote ins in each cluster, and how that can be linked to the drugs that target the cluster. While each amino acid in the sequence of a protein is represented by a letter and does not have a corresponding functional aspect, we need to consider something that is more functional and can be better related to the drugs that target the protein. After looking at the frequency of amino acids in clusters and their proteins, we take this one step further to look for reoccurring sub-sequences in order to achieve more functional data. Common sub-sequences among sequences within a cluster might give indication about the common target of the drugs that target the cluster. In every cluster of proteins (alternatively called proteins-cluster), we look for motifs.
The MEME [3,4] suite is an online tool that allows for different activities, including the discovery of motifs in clusters of related DNA or protein sequences, searching databases using motifs, and comparing a motif to all other motifs in a certain database. Each of the ten clusters of protein sequences were input into the MEME tool to obtain (for each cluster) an output which consists of three motifs that occur frequently in the cluster. Each motif has a few permutations; and it is associated with a certain E value that represents an estimate of the number of motifs (with the same width and number of occurrences) that would have equal or higher log likelihood ratio if the training set sequences had been generated randomly; this re fl ects the signi fi cance of the motif. The lower is the E value, the higher the chances are of this motif occurring in the cluster. Figure 8 shows a section of the sample output of the MEME tool by using the protei n sequences in one of the clusters as i nput. By utilizin g the MEME tool, for each cluster of proteins, the two motifs that have the lowest E values were selected to represent the cluster. Each motif has few permutations, in which each has a P value which represents the probability that the motif will be rejected as frequent in the cluster.

The determined motifs could have been randomly identi fi ed by chance or can be present in proteins for a speci fi c reason, as they could represent a certain purpose. Therefore, it is important to investigate what these motifs mean and how they can be related to having certain drugs targeting the proteins containing them. 4.3. Amino acid frequencies in motifs
Similar to amino acid frequency for protein sequences, amino acid frequencies were also found for the motifs for each cluster of proteins. This process has been applied in order to fi nd the signi fi cance of amino acid frequencies in the motifs found in each cluster and link that to the drug target interaction (functional domain and post translational modi fi cations, denoted PTM). We can then compare the frequencies of amino acids in clusters and in motifs. In this regard, we can see from Fig. 9 that some amino acids are more represented in some motifs. The idea here is to see whether there is correlation between the frequencies of amino acids in proteins and motifs. 4.4. Functional domains Motifs obtained for each cl uster can be translated into actual functionality pe rformed by the protein. This can be achieved by fi nding, if any, the protein functional domain that corresponds to a given motif.
A protein domain is a part of the protein that has certain functionality. It can vary in length; it is a substructure that can develop and exist separately, while not attached to the protein.
 Every domain corresponds to a 3D structure, and can be found in several related proteins. The PROSITE database has been used to fi nd the functional domain that corresponds to each of the motifs; it is part of the ExPasy server. The PROSITE database contains records of the information that identify domains, families and functional sites as well as amino acid patterns, signatures, and pro fi les in them. Each motif was entered into the database and the output was 0, 1 or more related functional domains.
The 20 motifs obtained (two for each proteins-cluster) did not all match to a functional domain. As shown in Fig. 10, only motifs belonging to clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 have matching protein domains. The latter domains can be linked to the drugs that target each of these clusters. 4.5. New protein prediction
Motifs are sequences that are found among a group of proteins. These motifs represent molecular structures that have a functional role. Using the motifs produced from the MEME tool, we can get other proteins that contain the same motif m ; the latter proteins can be grouped with the same proteins-cluster containing motif m . This way, we can predict the interaction of new protein targets by placing them in clusters that are targeted by certain drugs.

The tool used to obtain new potential protein targets is the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [2]. Each motif is input in the protein BLAST tool, which searches the Swissprot database (http://expasy.org/sprot/) for proteins that are matching the input motif. The output is a list of proteins that belong to different organisms, including humans; as shown in Fig. 11, these are actually the proteins we are interested in.

The output from looking up a sequence in the BLAST tool is a list of proteins that the given motif can be found in. The E value associated with each pr otein represents t he probab ility that ther e is another alignment (motif) with a similarity greater than the similarity of the input motif. The new potential proteins obtained from the BLAST search can be added to the target protein network and the clusters we already have, and more analysis can be done on those proteins in order to fi nd more similarities and create tighter clusters based on PTM and functional domains.
 4.6. Post translational modi fi cation
PTM of a protein is its chemical modi fi cation after it goes through translation. The protein attaches to other biochemical functional groups such as acetate, phosphate, lipids and carbohydrates and changes the chemical nature of an amino acid or makes structural changes. An example of a PTM is phosphorylation which is part of the mechanisms that control the behavior of the protein, such as activating or inactivating an enzyme.

Using the GENE Card database, we found and savedthe PTMs of each of the proteins in the 10 proteins-clusters. Only some of the proteins undergo PTM as shown in Fig. 12.
The biochemical functional groups that attach to the proteins in PTM may interact with other biological molecules. Therefore, we can conclude that drugs can bind to their targets because they interact with these groups. So we develop a relationship between the PTM of proteins and the drugs that target them.
Given the target-protein network, we divide each proteins-cluster into smaller clusters based on their shared PTM. Each protein node is closely connected to another protein node if they both have the same post translational modi fi cation, as shown in Fig. 12. By doing so, we form more functional based proteins-clusters that represent more purposeful relationships. This results in more tightly interconnected clusters. 4.7. Signalling pathways
Proteins can be related to each other because of similar functional domains, post translational domains or frequent motifs. A new measure of similarity to be considered is the interaction of proteins with each other in certain body processes. Proteins are part of many processes that take place in the human body. In these processes they interact with other proteins and other molecular structures. The interaction and reaction networks are represented by signal pathways that can graphically represent networks for processes such as metabolism, genetic information processing, cellular processes, human diseases and environmental information processing.

The visual pathway maps for proteins can be obtained from the KEGG Pathway Database. Figure 13 shows an example of a signalling pathway map for the protein ADRB1.

From the pathway maps, two steps can be taken towards better prediction of new protein targets. First, we can use the interactions to build stronger relationships between target proteins in the target protein network based on how they interact with each other. The closer the proteins are to each other in the signalling pathway, the shorter is the distance between the two proteins in the target protein network. Secondly, new target proteins can be discovered fro m signalling pathways given that a protein or more in the same pathway are targeted by a certain drug (or more). In other words, a new protein target is targeted by a certain drug if two or more protein targets that fall along the same pathway can be targeted by the same drug. 4.8. Drug protein correlation based on structures and net charges
In studying all of these aspects in drug-protein interaction, it is very important to consider the chemical structures of both the drugs and the proteins they target, given that the interaction is based on drugs structurally binding to the proteins. From here we raise an important question: can the charge correlation between the drug and the protein it targets be a reason justifying why this interaction occurs?
Consider the chemical structure of the 20 standard amino acids and note down their charges. Not all of the amino acids have a charge capable of affecting the shape of the protein; only fi ve of them do: namely Histidine (H), Lysine (K), Arginine (R), Asparatic acid (D) and Glumatic Acid (E), which are positively charged amino acids. These amino acids are referred to as polar charged amino acids.

We fi nd the  X  X harge X  of the drugs in our dataset by obtaining the number of N (positive) atoms and the number of O (negative) atoms in the drug. The drugs targeting the 10 clusters of proteins in our original dataset are also clustered into 10 groups. We calculate the positive and negative charges of each drugs-cluster as follows:
Then, for each proteins-cluster, we fi nd its positive and negative charges by simple calculating the frequencies of each of the positive and negative amino acids in the clusters; the result is shown in Fig. 14.
By comparing each of the positive and negative charges of the protein clusters and the drugs that target them, we can fi nd the functional correlation between the drugs and the proteins they target based on the net charge. Drugs with negative net charge are chemically more attracted to proteins enriched in negative amino acids. 5. Protein network
After studying in more detail the signi fi cance of the different factors in the similarity between proteins, the aspects discussed so far, namely functional domains, PTM and signalling pathways, a network of the proteins was built based on a combination of the different similarity measures. Proteins that share the same set of drugs, have similar PTM, share functional domain and have common motifs are linked.
Explicitly speaking, the network was built based on three criteria: functional domains, PTM and signalling pathways of proteins. By assigning incrementing constant values for every relationship between proteins based on one of the above criteria, the matrix with the fi nal results was obtained. The component of the network we mostly focus on is shown in Fig. 15. This is the component which includes all proteins that have functional domains, PTM and signalling pathway similarity. Only some of the proteins have functional domains, and hence the small size of the network. The network was visualized using the NetDraw package that is part of the UCINET data mining tool [7]. We applied the social network metrics on the constructed network and produced different rankings of the proteins based on three main centrality measures, namely closeness, betweenness and eigen-vector centrality. Proteins that receive higher values for these measures are considered more important. Our main deciding factor is the eigen-vector centrality measure; the other two centrality measures are used to adjust the eigen-vector based ranking by moving a protein up or down on the list based on whether for the considered protein the latter two values are high or low compared to the other proteins. This brief analysis of the network using the social network metrics con fi rmed the results reported by the main methodology presented in this paper; and hence turned the overall framework into a more robust approach. We intend to bring in more validation and con fi rmation of the results by a wider and more comprehensive application of the social network technique.
 6. Discussion and conclusions Identi fi cation of drug-target interaction networks is an essential step in the drug discovery pipeline. One of the major challenges in the fi eld of drug discovery is to fi nd the target of the drug. There are two trends in drug design; one is to design the drug, and then test it and the other one, which is more challenging, is to predict the target and then test it using existing drugs. In this work, we focused on the second trend as it is cheaper and does not involve huge body of experiments for testing. The motivation behind this work was to utilize the relationships between proteins targeted by certain drugs and proteins that are not targeted by any drug. Different methods to fi nd potential targets for existing drugs have been proposed and analyzed, yet to be biologically veri fi ed. This work is intensively based on data analysis by employing sophisticated techniques (data mining and social network analysis) that are integrated into a novel framework. The proposed framework could be considered a pre-processing step to fi nd protein communities that have certain drugs and hence form a good base for our future work to investigate protein communities for more useful and valuable discoveries. To sum up, the signi fi cance of this work can be summarized in three points. The fi rst is to identify protein features which can give better understanding of drug-protein associations. This could be considered as a base for future drug target prediction. The second is to identify protein communities that share features to enhance drug target interaction. Thus, proteins in the same community can be targeted by the same existing drug and no need to develop new drugs. The third point is to identify protein feat ures that are not getting enough attention in the drug development process.

The network built based on the processing of the data and then fi nding the similarity between proteins using amino acid frequency, PTM, functional domains and signaling pathwaysresulted in a small network that could be used to reveal the dugs behavior with proteins. Our planned future work would expand on the network and would allow for more understanding of the network; this will help in predicting more accurately the behavior of future drugs in regard to the given protein targets, as more data would be needed in order for this to be realized effectively.
