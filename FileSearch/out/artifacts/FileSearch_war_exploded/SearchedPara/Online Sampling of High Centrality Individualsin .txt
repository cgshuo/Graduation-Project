 Given a large or even massive social network, how can one efficiently identify the most important or influential individuals without complete access to the entire network at once? This scenario arises when the network is too large for conventional analysis to be computationally feasible. It may also arise in the context of mining data from a network whose complete structure is hidden from public view (such as a friendship network in Web-based social media) or has a highly distributed structure (such as the network of blogs or the Web itself). The efficient identification of influential individuals (by varying definitions of influence) in large social networks has many applications, from the prevention of computer worms to viral marketing. In this work, we investigate the use of online sampling in identifying such critical individuals.
 Online Sampling of Centrality. One of the key tasks in social network analy-sis is determining the relative importance of individuals based on their positions in the structure of the network [1, 2]. This is referred to as the centrality of individuals, and there are many notions of what it means to be central to a network [2]. In a sampling approach to centrality approximation, a subset of the individuals in the network is sampled, and an induced subgraph consisting only of these individuals and the links among them is produced. The centrality computation, then, is performed on this induced subgraph instead of the entire network, with the centrality scores of the sample being used as approximations of the true centrality of sampled individuals. It is clear that, for this approach to be useful, two criteria must be met. First, the sampling method must produce an induced subgraph that is representative of centrality in the original network (e.g. the centrality ranking in the sample should be consistent with that of the original network). Ideally, the sampling method will quickly find high centrality nodes, and these nodes will also be ranked highly when computing centrality on the sample. A second criterion is that the sampling method must be an online algorithm, since the network may be too large for its global structure to be ac-cessed in its entirety or the global view of the entire network may be limited. By online , we mean that the sampling is produ ced in an iterative, sequential manner, without a priori access to the entire input ( i.e. , sampling via crawling); at each iteration the new addition to the sample is based on the properties of the nodes crawled thus far. The next node selected for inclusion in the sample is al-ways chosen from the set of nodes connect ed directly to the current sample. This is also referred to as snowball sampling or neighborhood sampling .Inthiswork, we systematically investigate the task of online sampling of centrality in large social networks. We show that, by sampling nodes to maximize the expansion of the sample, the set of most influential individuals can be approximated across three different centrality measures: betwee nness, closeness, and eigenvector cen-trality. Remarkably, these sets of top ranked individuals can be approximated reasonably well with sample sizes as small as 1%. Centrality in Networks. The idea that the structural position of an individual in a social network may be correlated with the relative influence or importance of that individual was first postulated by Bavelas in the 1940s in the context of organizational communication [3, 1]. Since then, many notions of what it means to be important or central in a network have been proposed and applied with great success in a variety of different conte xts (e.g. [4,5]). In this paper we focus on three widely-used measures: betweenness centrality , closeness centrality ,and eigenvector centrality .The betweenness of a node is defined as the fraction of the overall shortest paths passing through a particular node [6,7,1]. The closeness of an individual in a network is a function of the inverse of the average distance to every other individual [1]. Finally, eigenvector centrality is a measure of prestige or popularity proposed by Bonacich [8]. When respresenting the entire network (or graph) as an adjacency matrix A , the eigenvector centrality of individuals in the network is the eigenvector x of matrix A corresponding to the largest eigenvalue  X  [8]. The PageRank measure [5] used by Google to rank search results is, in fact, simply a variant of e igenvector centrality and has been shown to be highly effective in approximating the prestige and authority of Web pages. Related Work. Web crawlers, programs that traverse the Web and index pages for search engines in an automa tedmanner,canbeviewedas online sampling algorithms. Although the goal of Web crawlers is to collect and store the Web link graph for offline processing, it is highly advantageous for crawling algorithms to seek out high PageRank pages early in the crawl [9]. As a result, there have been several studies evaluating these algorithms in their ability to sample PageRank (e.g. [9,10,11,12]). In Section 4.2, we evaluate the performance of several of these algorithms in the context of undirected social networks and in their ability to sample alternative notions of network centrality. Finally, also related to this work are the existing studies on representative subgraph sampling such as [13, 14, 15]. We employ an online sampling algorithm to sample individuals in the social network. Let G =( V, E )bea network or graph where V is set of vertices (or nodes) and E  X  V  X  V is a set of edges (or links between the nodes). We begin by selecting a single individual v  X  V uniformly at random and specifying a desired sample size k where k V .Thesample S  X  V , then, is initialized to { v } .Each subsequent individual selected for inclusion in the sample is chosen from the current neighborhood N ( S ), where N ( S )= { w  X  V  X  S :  X  v  X  Ss.t. ( v, w )  X  E } . Next, upon constructing the sample S , a centrality measure is computed on the induced subgraph of the sample, G ( S ). The critical question is how to select individuals from N ( S ) such that: 1. The ranking of individuals by centrality scores in G ( S ) corresponds to the 2. The highest centrality individuals are quickly included in the sample. Moreover, as an online algorithm, these selection decisions must be made solely on the basis of local information (i.e. information obtained only from those indi-viduals already crawled). In the following sections, we describe several different approaches to online sampling.
 Expansion Sampling. We now describe a novel sampling technique based on the concept of expansion in graphs [16]. We refer to this method as expan-sion sampling (XS). The expansion of a sample S is defined as | N ( S ) | | S | .Inthis approach, we seek out the sample S of size k with the maximal expansion: in order to maximize the expansion of the current sample. That is, the next node v selected for inclusion in the sample is chosen based on the expression: argmax v  X  N ( S ) | N ( { v } )  X  ( N ( S )  X  S ) | .
 Web Crawlers. As mentioned previously, the process of web crawling is essen-tially an online sampling process. There are several crawlers explicitly designed to include high PageRank nodes into the sample more quickly. One such ap-proach is referred to as Backlink Count (BLC) in which the next node selected for inclusion into the sample is the node with the most links to nodes already in the sample [11]. A second approach is referred as the OPIC algorithm [10]. In this approach, all individuals are assigned a default  X  X ash X  value. When a node is included in the sample, its cash is distributed to its neighbors in equal pro-portion. The next node selected for inclu sion into the sample, then, is a function of the sum of cash a node has received f rom its neighbors. We evaluate both these methods not only in their ability to sample PageRank (or Eigenvector Centrality), but also other centrality measures.
 BFS, DFS, and Random Walks. As a basis for comparison, we evaluate the performance of several basic approaches to online sampling. Specifically, we evaluate the breadth-first search (BFS), the depth-first search (DFS), and sampling based on a random walk (RW) of the social network. 4.1 Experimental Setup Datasets. We evaluate four diverse, real-world social networks 1 . These include a co-authorship network (Cond-Mat [17]), an email network (Enron [18]), an online trust network (Epinions [19]), and an online social network (Slashdot [20]). Sampling Methodology. As described earlier, our aim is to sample a minute fraction of the individuals in the original network in a way that the individuals ranked highly in the entire network are both present and ranked highly in the induced subgraph of the sample. We ex ecute each sampling algorithm on each dataset and sample up to 5% of the nodes. Ten samples are produced by each algorithm on each dataset. During the sampling process, at one percent inter-vals (e.g. 1% , 2% ,..., 5%), we compute centrality and evaluation statistics on the induced subgraph of the sample and compare those with the original net-work (evaluation criteria are described in the next section). When evaluating eigenvector centrality, we employ the PageRank variant (PageRank is a variant of eigenvector centrality, as described in Section 2).
 Measuring Sample Quality. We employ two evaluation criteria to measure the quality of samples. First, we perform a rank correlation between the central-ity ranking in the sample and the true centrality ranking in the original network using Kendall X  X  Tau [21]. This measure (which ranges in value from  X  1to1) evaluates the extent to which the relative ordering by centrality of all nodes in the sample is consistent with that of the original network. A value of 1 indi-cates the rankings are perfectly consistent, and a value of  X  1 indicates they are inversely consistent. However, in most cases, it is the set of high centrality indi-viduals in the network that is of the most interest. A sample exhibiting a high rank correlation, but consisting only of low centrality individuals is not of inter-estinmostcases.Therefore,weemploya second, more informative, evaluation criterion based on the Jacca rd measure of set similarity [22], which is the size of the intersection of two sets divided by t he size of the union. A Jaccard similarity of 1 indicates that all the elements are shared between the sets, and a score of 0 indicates that none of the elements are shared. We take the top k individuals in the sample centrality ranking and the top k individuals in the ranking of the original network and measure the Jaccard set similarity. This measure indicates how well each sampling algorithm is able to determine the identity of the top k highest centrality individuals . For our experiments, we use k = 50. 4.2 Experimental Results Identifying High Betweenness Individuals. Figure 1a shows the extent to which each sampling algorithm is able to identify individuals with the highest betweenness scores in the network. On all datasets, the expansion sampling al-gorithm consistently (and significantly) outperforms all other approaches. Recall that, in expansion sampling , nodes selected for inclusion in the sample are those that maximize the expansion of the sample at each step: argmax v  X  N ( S ) | N ( { v } )  X  ( N ( S )  X  S ) | . By sampling nodes that contribute most to the expansion, the algo-rithm seeks out individuals with the most dissimilar neighborhood. These nodes, then, should be brokers or bridges between different neighborhoods or clusters of individuals, which captures the notion of betweenness.

The random walk sampling, in some cases, also identifies high betweenness fairly well (though, not as well as expansion sampling ). Intuitively, high between-ness individuals will appear with high frequency on the paths between other individuals. Performing a random walk, then, should tend to traverse through high betweenness nodes, thereby, including them in the sample. Finally, we see that BFS and OPIC sampling perform particularly poorly when being used to find high betweenness individuals.
 Identifying High Closeness Individuals. As shown in 1b, expansion sam-pling also outperforms other methods in its ability to sample high closeness individuals. Recall that closeness centr ality is a measure of how close an individ-ual is to all other individuals in the network. Why should expansion sampling also perform best on this centrality measure? Consider a sample S with high expansion (i.e. | N ( S ) | | S | is significantly large). This means that the sample S ,asa whole, is one hop away from many other individuals in the network, which, by definition, is closeness. In addition, as with betweenness, BFS sampling again performs poorly in identifying high closeness individuals.
 Identifying High PageRank Individuals. Figure 1c shows the performance of each sampling technique in sampling PageRank. Surprisingly, expansion sam-pling again outperforms other methods (although, not as dramatically as with betweenness and closeness). This result is quite unexpected, as the Web crawling algorithms have been specifically designed to sample high PageRank individuals quickly. Moreover, one would expect a r andom walk sampling strategy to per-form much better (if not the best) because, by the very formulation of PageRank centrality, high PageRank individuals will tend to be visited more frequently by a random walker. But, clearly, this property holds only in the limit and not for a small sample. Overall, once again, it is expansion sampling that identifies high PageRank individuals most effectively.
 On the Concordance Across Centrality Measures. Thus far, we have shown that expansion sampling performs best in identifying influential individ-uals by all three centrality measures evaluated . A single sample produced by the expansion sampling algorithm, then, includes individuals ranking highly on multiple centrality measures. This begs the question: to what extent do these dif-ferent centrality measures coincide or correspond with one another in real-world, social networks? That is, does expansion sampling simply find individuals that simultaneously rank highly on all three of the centrality measures? Upon closer inspection, we find this to not always be the case. Although we do find some agreement or overlap across the centralit y measures (i.e. there exist individuals ranking highly on multiple measures), expansion sampling does, in fact, find indi-viduals over and above this overlap. We compute the Jaccard similarity between the sets of the top 50 ranked individuals in the entire network by each centrality measure (i.e. the similarity between each of the true , global centrality rankings). For instance, in the Enron dataset, we find that the Jaccard similarity of the betweenness ranking and the closeness ranking (both of the entire Enron net-work) is 0 . 37. However, as shown in Figure 1b, the Jaccard similarity between the closeness ranking of the entire network and the closeness ranking of the sample produced by expansion sampling ranges from 0 . 6to0 . 75 (over and above 0 . 37). This indicates that the expansion sampling method does, in fact, find in-dividuals ranked highly only on closeness and not on betweenness. Using similar analysis, expansion sampling also finds individuals ranking highly on between-ness and not on closeness. Although expansion sampling does indeed identify individuals ranking highly on multiple measures, remarkably, this method also finds individuals that each rank highly on different measures of centrality. This is striking, as one would not expect a single , biased sampling strategy to be able to find high ranked nodes across multiple (and diverse) meas ures of centrality. The expansion sampling method, however, does just this.
 Consistency in Relative Ordering of Sample and Original Network. Fi-nally, we show the Kendall X  X  Tau rank correlation between the centrality ranking of the samples and the true centrality ranking in the original network (over all individuals in the sample). Due to space constraints, we only show the results for the Enron network in Figure 2. Although results vary slightly across measures and datasets, all sampling algorithms seem to exhibit a relatively strong consis-tency in the relative ordering of sampled individuals by centrality in comparison to the true centrality ranking. The key to effectively identifying the top ranked individuals, then, is finding and including them early in the sampling process. As discussed in Sections 4.2, 4.2, and 4.2, it is expansion sampling that is most effective in this regard. Inthiswork,wehavestudiedtheuseof online sampling to identify the set of individuals exhibiting the highest centrality in large social networks. We showed that, by sampling nodes to maximize the expansion of the sample, the set of most influential individuals can be approximated across multiple centrality measures. For future work, we plan to investigate the effect of network and graph-theoretic properties on the performance of these and other sampling strategies.
