 The application of data mining and knowledge discovery techniques to medical and health datasets is a rewarding but highly challenging area. Not only are the datasets large, complex, heterogeneous, hierarchical, time-varying and of varying quality but there exists a substantial medical knowl-edge base which demands a robust collaboration between the data miner and the health professional(s) if useful informa-tion is to be extracted.
 This paper presents the experiences of the authors and oth-ers in applying exploratory data mining techniques to medi-cal, health and clinical data. In so doing, it elicits a number of general issues and provides pointers to possible areas of fu-ture research in data mining and knowledge discovery more broadly.
 Exploratory Data Mining from Health and Medical Data, Clinical Knowledge Discovery. Data mining algorithms and knowledge discovery frame-works have been successfully applied in a number of ap-plication domains including telecommunications, commerce, astronomy, geological survey and security (q.v. [16; 20; 34] and many others). For a number of reasons, the application of the technology to large medical datasets has necessarily been more circumspect. However, while data mining from medical, health and clinical data 1 can be problematic, it promises substantial rewards and has attracted some inter-est (q.v. [3; 21; 25; 26; 27; 29; 30; 31; 35; 44; 47] and particu-larly [9]). Much of this work reports on specific examples of applying explanatory mining techniques to particular, nar-rowly defined medical problems. Very little of the research is exploratory and, for some good reasons, very few broad exploratory analyses have been performed and reported. The history of medical science as a discipline is extensive, sometimes tragic, certainly heroic and often serendipitous.
The terms medical , health and clinical are not synonymous but for brevity in this paper we will use the term medical to include all three.
 In practice, there are two forms of data mining applied over medical data. Explanatory or confirmative data mining has been applied fairly widely to determine, for example, the optimum decisions to take under various clinical conditions or to predict an eventual insurance claim amount based on early diagnoses and the circumstances known at that point. On the other hand exploratory data mining has, to date, been applied relatively rarely.
 In this section we discuss a few of the major issues which complicate exploratory medical data mining in relation to the various other domains in which it has been found to be useful. It is acknowledged that some of these issues do occur in other domains although rarely with the same level of interplay and difficulty. While much useful medical data mining can be undertaken using more conventional mining methods, (both those used pragmatically for quick inspections and those facilitated by frameworks such as CRISP-DM [7]) other approaches often need to be considered. For example, the dominant med-ical research paradigm, the null hypothesis experimental method, used in medical / bioscientific research differs from that adopted by many other fields and often requires a change Figure 1: Scientific Knowledge Discovery Framework af-ter [37]. to the knowledge discovery framework being employed. For example, we might look for an absence of conflicting data or we might generate a set of expected rules that are then compared with a set generated from the null hypothesis and for which we are searching for a lack of intersection between them. The framework in Figure 1 shows schematically the reversal of the process needed for this domain. To our knowl-edge, little work has been undertaken in this regard. As someone X  X  health is often related to their environment, the accommodation of standard medical datasets (for exam-ple, the ICD10 and DRG standards for grouping diagnoses and procedures) is essential for sensible interpretation. As the semantics of the rules discovered are qualified by the se-mantics of the links between datasets, such linkages must be well understood. Note that the confidentialisation of data through the removal of keys can sometimes hinder such link-ing.
 However, as well as the standard medical datasets, we have found trusted external datasets (for example, statistical lo-cal area (SLA data), state and federal government data, me-teorology data, and so on) to be particularly useful. Many contain hierarchies (see Section 2.5). The interpretation of the results of mining over medical datasets requires significant domain expertise. It is some-what simpler for the developers of data mining routines to understand the results of routines run over, say, market bas-ket or financial trading data. The need for strong cooper-ation between the IT researcher and the medical domain expert(s) is thus higher.
 The results of data mining runs are never a set of  X  X ules X  in the deductive sense and this is particularly true of medical data mining. Any results found should be interpreted solely as suggestions for future research. In many cases, the rules have been generally known (at least by the medical frater-nity) and in other cases less widely, but still nevertheless known by specialists. Only in a few cases have our routines yielded genuinely new knowledge; we would argue, however, that the process is often worth the effort just for these few cases.
 One of the major differences between medical data mining and mining over other fields is the vast (and assumed) knowl-edge existing in the field. In one study 3 the proportion of rules that were already readily known by the medical team members was almost total. In response to this, our itemset and rule visualisation algorithm IsetN av was redeveloped to accommodate a knowledge base into which known rules could be placed leading to the (optional) suppression of these rules 4 . IsetN av also accommodates hierarchies as discussed earlier.
The results of this study (although not the technical mining details) are reported in [18].
Note that in IsetN av a rule is considered to consist not only of its antecedents and consequents but also of its support and confidence (ie. its full signature  X a la [41]). A sig-nificant change in, say, the confidence of a rule would thus be interpreted as interesting and the rule would be redisplayed. While this is not an algorithmic or technical issue, much of the literature, as well our own experiences, have suggested that we ignore the complexities of data availability at our peril. The field of knowledge discovery, in common with many powerful technologies, lends itself both to abuse and to great benefit. However, unlike many technologies, the ability to compromise privacy, to stereotype, or simply to cause offense (potentially leading to litigation) can often be inadvertent. The complexities of the legal framework [39] together with the complexities of rule generation, particular medical rule generation, often means that the human post-processing of a data mining run can be a long and potentially complex process. As the focus is inevitably on the medical message being given, sociological issues in specific attribute values can be missed. For example, consider the following (simple and fictional) rule: This would be a worrying rule to discover for any segment of the population but consider the increased risk of offense if ZipCode (52409) referred to, say, an indigenous community, a University campus or an area of high ethnic migration. Both within and outside of the KDD community there is significant concern regarding the (ab)use of sensitive infor-mation [4; 6; 11; 12; 10; 32; 42]. Estivill-Castro et al. , for example, cite recent surveys about public opinion surround-ing personal privacy which show concern about the use of private information such as medical data [15]. However, with some significant exceptions (see for example [1; 36]), to date, few practical solutions have been advanced. A serious breach of privacy might result in a reactive legisla-tive response which could hinder research such as this. We therefore suggest that, in additional to the normal ethical safeguards and existing government legislation, a potential research direction could be for the KDD community to de-velop a standard set of guidelines to assist researchers with these issues.
