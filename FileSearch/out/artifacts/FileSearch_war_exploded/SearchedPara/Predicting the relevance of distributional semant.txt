 The goal of the work presented in this paper is to improve distributional thesauri, and to help evalu-ate the content of such resources. A distributional thesaurus is a lexical network that lists semantic neighbours, computed from a corpus and a simi-larity measure between lexical items, which gen-erally captures the similarity of contexts in which the items occur. This way of building a seman-tic network has been very popular since (Grefen-stette, 1994; Lin, 1998), even though the nature of the information it contains is hard to define, and its evaluation is far from obvious. A distributional thesaurus includes a lot of  X  X oise X  from a seman-tic point of view, but also lists relevant lexical pairs that escape classical lexical relations such as syn-onymy or hypernymy.

There is a classical dichotomy when evaluat-ing NLP components between extrinsic and in-trinsic evaluations (Jones, 1994), and this applies to distributional thesauri (Curran, 2004; Poibeau and Messiant, 2008). Extrinsic evaluations mea-sure the capacity of a system in which a resource or a component to evaluate has been used, for in-stance in this case information retrieval (van der Plas, 2008) or word sense disambiguation (Weeds and Weir, 2005). Intrinsic evaluations try to mea-sure the resource itself with respect to some hu-man standard or judgment, for instance by com-paring a distributional resource with respect to an existing synonym dictionary or similarity judg-ment produced by human subjects (Pado and La-pata, 2007; Baroni and Lenci, 2010). The short-comings of these methods have been underlined in (Baroni and Lenci, 2011). Lexical resources designed for other objectives put the spotlight on specific areas of the distributional thesaurus. They are not suitable for the evaluation of the whole range of semantic relatedness that is exhibited by distributional similarities, which exceeds the lim-its of classical lexical relations, even though re-searchers have tried to collect equivalent resources manually, to be used as a gold standard (Weeds, 2003; Bordag, 2008; Anguiano et al., 2011). One advantage of distributional similarities is to exhibit a lot of different semantic relations, not necessar-ily standard lexical relations. Even with respect to established lexical resources, distributional ap-proaches may improve coverage, complicating the evaluation even more.

The method we propose here has been de-signed as an intrinsic evaluation with a view to validate semantic proximity links in a broad per-spective, to cover what (Morris and Hirst, 2004) call  X  X on classical lexical semantic relations X . For instance, agentive relations (author/publish, author/publication) or associative relations (ac-tor/cinema) should be considered. At the same time, we want to filter associations that can be considered as accidental in a semantic perspective (e.g. flag and composer are similar because they appear a lot with nationality names). We do this by judging the relevance of a lexical relation in a context where both elements of a lexical pair oc-cur. We show not only that this improves the relia-bility of human judgments, but also that it gives a framework where this relevance can be predicted automatically. We hypothetize that evaluating and filtering semantic relations in texts where lexical items occur would help tasks that naturally make use of semantic similarity relations, but assessing this goes beyond the present work.

In the rest of this paper, we describe the re-source we used as a case study, and the data we collected to evaluate its content (section 2). We present the experiments we set up to automatically filter semantic relations in context, with various groups of features that take into account informa-tion from the corpus used to build the thesaurus and contextual information related to occurrences of semantic neighbours 3). Finally we discuss some related work on the evaluation and improve-ment of distributional resources (section 4). 2.1 Data We use a distributional resource for French, built on a 200M word corpus extracted from the French Wikipedia, following principles laid out in (Bouri-gault, 2002) from a structured model (Baroni and Lenci, 2010), i.e. using syntactic con-texts. In this approach, contexts are triples (gover-nor,relation,dependent) derived from syntactic de-pendency structures. Governors and dependents are verbs, adjectives and nouns. Multiword units are available, but they form a very small subset of the resulting neighbours. Base elements in the thesaurus are of two types: arguments (depen-dents X  lemma) and predicates (governor+relation). This is to keep the predicate/argument distinction since similarities will be computed between pred-icate pairs or argument pairs, and a lexical item can appear in many predicates and as an argument (e.g. interest as argument, interest for as one pred-icate). The similarity of distributions was com-puted with Lin X  X  score (Lin, 1998).

We will talk of lexical neighbours or distribu-tional neighbours to label pairs of predicates or ar-guments, and in the rest of the paper we consider only lexical pairs with a Lin score of at least 0.1, which means about 1.4M pairs. This somewhat arbitrary level is an a priori threshold to limit the resulting database, and it is conservative enough not to exclude potential interesting relations. The distribution of scores is given figure 1; 97% of the selected pairs have a score between 0.1 and 0.29. Figure 1: Histogram of Lin scores for pairs con-sidered.

To ease the use of lexical neighbours in our ex-periments, we merged together predicates that in-clude the same lexical unit, a posteriori . Thus there is no need for a syntactic analysis of the con-text considered when exploiting the resource, and 2.2 Annotation In order to evaluate the resource, we set up an an-notation in context: pairs of lexical items are to be judged in their context of use, in texts where they occur together. To verify that this method-ology is useful, we did a preliminary annotation to contrast judgment on lexical pairs with or with-out this contextual information. Then we made a larger annotation in context once we were assured of the reliability of the methodology.

For the preliminary test, we asked three annota-tors to judge the similarity of pairs of lexical items without any context ( no-context ), and to judge the the morphology of the impala, and its habitat. similarity of pairs presented within a paragraph where they both occur ( in context ). The three an-notators were linguists, and two of them (1 and 3) knew about the resource and how it was built. For each annotation, 100 pairs were randomly se-lected, with the following constraints:  X  for the no-context annotation, candidate pairs  X  for the in context annotation, the only con-
The guidelines given in both cases were the same:  X  X o you think the two words are seman-tically close ? In other words, is there a seman-tic relation between them, either classical (syn-onymy, hypernymy, co-hyponymy, meronymy, co-meronymy) or not (the relation can be paraphrased but does not belong to the previous cases) ? X 
For the pre-test, agreement was rather moderate without context (the average of pairwise kappas was .46), and much better with a context (aver-age = .68), with agreement rates above 90%. This seems to validate the feasability of a reliable anno-tation of relatedness in context, so we went on for a larger annotation with two of the previous anno-tators.

For the larger annotation, the protocol was slightly changed: two annotators were given 42 full texts from the original corpus where lexical neighbours occurred. They were asked to judge the relation between two items types, regardless of the number of occurrences in the text. This time there was no filtering of the lexical pairs beyond the 0.1 threshold of the original resource. We fol-lowed the well-known postulate (Gale et al., 1992) that all occurrences of a word in the same dis-course tend to have the same sense ( X  X ne sense per discourse X ), in order to decrease the annotator workload. We also assumed that the relation be-tween these items remain stable within the docu-ment, an arguably strong hypothesis that needed to be checked against inter-annotator agreement be-fore beginning the final annotation . It turns out that the kappa score ( 0 . 80 ) shows a better inter-annotator agreement than during the preliminary test, which can be explained by the larger context given to the annotator (the whole text), and thus more occurrences of each element in the pair to judge, and also because the annotators were more experienced after the preliminary test. Agreement measures are summed-up table 1. An excerpt of an example text, as it was presented to the annotators, is shown figure 2.

Overall, it took only a few days to annotate 9885 pairs of lexical items. Among the pairs that were presented to the annotators, about 11% were judged as relevant by the annotators. It is not easy to decide if the non-relevant pairs are just noise, or context-dependent associations that were not present in the actual text considered (for pol-ysemy reasons for instance), or just low-level as-sociations. An important aspect is thus to guar-antee that there is a correlation between the sim-the same corpus, only with the full discourse context. ilarity score (Lin X  X  score here), and the evaluated relevance of the neighbour pairs. Pearson corre-lation factor shows that Lin score is indeed sig-nificantly correlated to the annotated relevance of lexical pairs, albeit not strongly ( r = 0 . 159 ). erence to explore various aspects of distributional resources, with the caveat that it is as such a bit dependent on the particular resource used. We nonetheless assume that some of the relevant pairs would appear in other thesauri, or would be of in-terest in an evaluation of another resource.
The first thing we can analyse from the anno-tated data is the impact of a threshold on Lin X  X  score to select relevant lexical pairs. The resource itself is built by choosing a cut-off which is sup-posed to keep pairs with a satisfactory similar-ity, but this threshold is rather arbitrary. Figure 3 shows the influence of the threshold value to se-lect relevant pairs, when considering precision and recall of the pairs that are kept when choosing the threshold, evaluated against the human annotation of relevance in context. In case one wants to opti-mize the F-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) when extracting relevant pairs, we can see that the optimal point is at .24 for a threshold of .22 on Lin X  X  score. This can be considered as a baseline for extraction of relevant lexical pairs, to which we turn in the following section. The outcome of the contextual annotation pre-sented above is a rather sizeable dataset of val-idated semantic links, and we showed these lin-guistic judgments to be reliable. We used this Figure 3: Precision and recall on relevant links with respect to a threshold on the similarity mea-sure (Lin X  X  score) dataset to set up a supervised classification exper-iment in order to automatically predict the rele-vance of a semantic link in a given discourse. We present now the list of features that were used for the model. They can be divided in three groups, according to their origin: they are computed from the whole corpus, gathered from the distributional resource, or extracted from the considered text which contains the semantic pair to be evaluated. 3.1 Features For each pair neighbour a / neighbour b , we com-puted a set of features from Wikipedia (the corpus used to derive the distributional similarity): We first computed the frequencies of each item in the corpus, f req a and f req b , from which we derive  X  f req min , f req max : the min and max of  X  f req  X  : the combination of the two, or We also measured the syntagmatic association of neighbour a and neighbour b , with a mutual infor-mation measure (Church and Hanks, 1990), com-puted from the cooccurrence of two tokens within the same paragraph in Wikipedia. This is a rather large window, and thus gives a good coverage with respect to the neighbour database (70% of all pairs).

A straightforward parameter to include to pre-dict the relevance of a link is of course the simi-larity measure itself, here Lin X  X  information mea-sure. But this can be complemented by additional information on the similarity of the neighbours, namely:  X  each neighbour productivity : prod a and  X  the ranks of tokens in other related items We add two categorial features, of a more linguis-tic nature:  X  cats is the pair of part-of-speech for the re- X  predarg is related to the predicate/argument
The last set of features derive from the occur-rences of related tokens in the considered dis-courses:
First, we take into account the frequencies of items within the text, with three features as before: the min of the frequencies of the two related items, the max, and the log-product. Then we consider a tf  X  idf (Salton et al., 1975) measure, to evaluate the specificity and arguably the importance of a word
Feature Description f req min min( f req a , f req b ) f req max max( f req a , f req b ) f req  X  log( f req a  X  f req b ) lin Lin X  X  score prod min min( prod a , prod b ) prod max max( prod a , prod b ) prod  X  log( prod a  X  prod b ) cats neighbour pos pair predarg predicate or argument f reqtxt min min( f reqtxt a , f reqtxt b ) f reqtxt max max( f reqtxt a , f reqtxt b ) f reqtxt  X  log( f reqtxt a  X  f reqstxt b ) tf  X  ipf tf  X  ipf ( neighbour a )  X  tf  X  ipf ( neighbour b copr ph copresence in a sentence copr para copresence in a paragraph sd smallest distance between gd highest distance between neighbour a ad average distance between neighbour a prodtxt min min( prod a , prod b ) prodtxt max max( prod a , prod b ) prodtxt  X  log( prod a  X  prod b ) cc belong to the same lexical connected Table 2: Summary of features used in the super-vised model, with respect to two lexical items a and b . The first group is corpus related, the second group is related to the distributional database, the third group is related to the textual context. Freq is related to the frequencies in the corpus, Freqtext the frequencies in the considered text. in a document or within a document. Several vari-ants of tf  X  idf have been proposed to adapt the mea-sure to more local areas in a text with respect to the whole document. For instance (Dias et al., 2007) propose a tf  X  isf ( term frequency  X  inverse sentence frequency ), for topic segmentation. We similarly defined a tf  X  ipf measure based on the frequency of a word within a paragraph with respect to its fre-quency within the text. The resulting feature we used is the product of this measure for neighbour a and neighbour b .

A few other contextual features are included in the model: the distances between pairs of related items, instantiated as:  X  distance in words between occurrences of re- X  boolean features indicating whether
Finally, we took into account the network of re-lated lexical items, by considering the largest sets of words present in the text and connected in the database (self-connected components), by adding the following features:  X  the degree of each lemma, seen as a node  X  a boolean feature cc saying whether a lexi-The last feature is probably not entirely indepen-dent from the productivity of an item, or from the tf.ipf measure.

Table 2 sums up the features used in our model. 3.2 Model Our task is to identify relevant similarities between lexical items, between all possible related pairs, and we want to train an inductive model, a clas-sifier, to extract the relevant links. We have seen that the relevant/not relevant classification is very imbalanced, biased towards the  X  X ot relevant X  cat-egory (about 11%/89%), so we applied methods dedicated to counter-balance this, and will focus on the precision and recall of the predicted rele-vant links.

Following a classical methodology, we made a 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate robustly the performance of the classifiers. We tested a few popular machine learning methods, and report on two of them, a naive bayes model and the best method on our dataset, the Random Forest clas-sifier (Breiman, 2001). Other popular methods (maximum entropy, SVM) have shown slightly in-ferior combined F-score, even though precision and recall might yield more important variations. As a baseline, we can also consider a simple threshold on the lexical similarity score, in our case Lin X  X  measure, which we have shown to yield the best F-score of 24% when set at 0.22.

To address class imbalance, two broad types of methods can be applied to help the model focus on the minority class. The first one is to resam-ple the training data to balance the two classes, the second one is to penalize differently the two classes during training when the model makes a mistake (a mistake on the minority class being made more costly than on the majority class). We tested the two strategies, by applying the classical Smote method of (Chawla et al., 2002) as a kind of resampling, and the ensemble method Meta-Cost of (Domingos, 1999) as a cost-aware learn-ing method. Smote synthetizes and adds new in-stances similar to the minority class instances and is more efficient than a mere resampling. Meta-Cost is an interesting meta-learner that can use any classifier as a base classifier. We used Weka X  X  implementations of these methods (Frank et al., 2004), and our experiments and comparisons are thus easily replicated on our dataset, provided with this paper, even though they can be improved by m ` etres .

 other lexical elements in the neighbour database. refinements of these techniques. We chose the following settings for the different models: naive bayes uses a kernel density estimation for numer-ical features, as this generally improves perfor-mance. For Random Forests, we chose to have ten trees, and each decision is taken on a randomly chosen set of five features. For resampling, Smote advises to double the number of instances of the minority class, and we observed that a bigger re-sampling degrades performances. For cost-aware learning, a sensible choice is to invert the class ra-tio for the cost ratio, i.e. here the cost of a mistake on a relevant link (false negative) is exactly 8.5 times higher than the cost on a non-relevant link (false positive), as non-relevant instances are 8.5 times more present than relevant ones. 3.3 Results We are interested in the precision and recall for the  X  X elevant X  class. If we take the best simple classifier (random forests), the precision and re-call are 68 . 1% and 24 . 2% for an F-score of 35 . 7% , and this is significantly beaten by the Naive Bayes method as precision and recall are more even (F-score of 41.5%). This is already a big improve-ment on the use of the similarity measure alone (24%). Also note that predicting every link as rel-evant would result in a 2.6% precision, and thus a 5% F-score. The random forest model is signifi-cantly improved by the balancing techniques: the overall best F-score of 46.3% is reached with Ran-dom Forests and the cost-aware learning method. Table 3 sums up the scores for the different con-figurations, with precision, recall, F-score and the confidence interval on the F-score. We analysed the learning curve by doing a cross-validation on reduced set of instances (from 10% to 90%); F1-scores range from 37.3% with 10% of instances and stabilize at 80%, with small increment in ev-ery case.

The filtering approach we propose seems to yield good results, by augmenting the similarity built on the whole corpus with signals from the lo-cal contexts and documents where related lexical items appear together.

To try to analyse the role of each set of fea-tures, we repeated the experiment but changed the set of features used during training, and results are shown table 4 for the best method (RF with cost-aware learning).

We can see that similarity-related features (mea-sures, ranks) have the biggest impact, but the other ones also seem to play a significant role. We can draw the tentative conclusion that the quality of distributional relations depends on the contextual-izing of the related lexical items, beyond just the similarity score and the ranks of items as neigh-bours of other items. = Random Forest, NB= naive bayes).
 impact of the removed group of features. Our work is related to two issues: evaluating dis-tributional resources, and improving them. Eval-uating distributional resources is the subject of a lot of methodological reflection (Sahlgren, 2006), and as we said in the introduction, evaluations can be divided between extrinsic and intrinsic evalua-tions. In extrinsic evaluations, models are evalu-ated against benchmarks focusing on a single task or a single aspect of a resource: either discrimina-tive, TOEFL-like tests (Freitag et al., 2005), anal-ogy production (Turney, 2008), or synonym selec-tion (Weeds, 2003; Anguiano et al., 2011; Fer-ret, 2013; Curran and Moens, 2002). In intrin-sic evaluations, associations norms are used, such as the 353 word-similarity dataset (Finkelstein et al., 2002), e.g. (Pado and Lapata, 2007; Agirre et al., 2009), or specifically designed test cases, as in (Baroni and Lenci, 2011). We differ from all these evaluation procedures as we do not focus on an essential view of the relatedness of two lexical items, but evaluate the link in a context where the relevance of the link is in question, an  X  X xistential X  view of semantic relatedness.

As for improving distributional thesauri, out-side of numerous alternate approaches to the construction, there is a body of work focusing on improving an existing resource, for instance reweighting context features once an initial the-saurus is built (Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan, 2009), or post-processing the resource to filter bad neighbours or re-ranking neighbours of a given target (Ferret, 2013). They still use  X  X ssential X  evaluation measures (mostly synonym extraction), although the latter comes close to our work since it also trains a model to detect (intrinsically) bad neighbours by using example sentences with the words to discriminate. We are not aware of any work that would try to evaluate differently seman-tic neighbours according to the context they ap-pear in. We proposed a method to reliably evaluate distri-butional semantic similarity in a broad sense by considering the validation of lexical pairs in con-texts where they both appear. This helps cover non classical semantic relations which are hard to eval-uate with classical resources. We also presented a supervised learning model which combines global features from the corpus used to built a distribu-tional thesaurus and local features from the text where similarities are to be judged as relevant or not to the coherence of a document. It seems from these experiments that the quality of distri-butional relations depends on the contextualizing of the related lexical items, beyond just the simi-larity score and the ranks of items as neighbours of other items. This can hopefully help filter out lex-ical pairs when word lexical similarity is used as an information source where context is important: lexical disambiguation (Miller et al., 2012), topic segmentation (Guinaudeau et al., 2012). This can also be a preprocessing step when looking for sim-ilarities at higher levels, for instance at the sen-tence level (Mihalcea et al., 2006) or other macro-textual level (Agirre et al., 2013), since these are always aggregation functions of word similarities. There are limits to what is presented here: we need to evaluate the importance of the level of noise in the distributional neighbours database, or at least the quantity of non-semantic relations present, and this depends on the way the database is built. Our starting corpus is relatively small compared to cur-rent efforts in this framework. We are confident that the same methodology can be followed, even though the quantitative results may vary, since it is independent of the particular distributional the-saurus we used, and the way the similarities are computed.
