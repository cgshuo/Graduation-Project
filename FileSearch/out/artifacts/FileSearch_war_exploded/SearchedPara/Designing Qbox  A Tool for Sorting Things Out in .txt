 This poster introduces Qbox, a flexible tool developed by the Communicative Practices in Virtua l Workspaces research group at the University of Washington to support traditional and innovative forms of analysis for web-base d and digital material. Qbox integrates three functional areas of work associated with content analysis: consolidating and pr esenting source data, performing coding or classification work, a nd analyzing results. Developed using an iterative user-cente red design approach to support ongoing research, this tool enhances research protocol by providing a flexible application to organize digital spaces, and demonstrates the power of produc tivity associated with agile, user-based development.

Management, Design, Experimentation, Human Factors Computer-supported cooperativ e work, computer-mediated communication, soci otechnical systems The Communicative Practices in Virtual Workspaces research group at the University of Washington has multiple research projects in process at any given time that require a high degree of coordination among members. Much of the current research involves complex analysis of di gital media to better understand embedded social, rhetorical, and usability mechanics of online interactions. Lacking existing tools able to facilitate coordinated research in digital spaces, the research team implemented a user-centered design approach to creat e an application that not only supported current research but would result in a flexible tool to be used for future needs. The resulting tool, Qbox, allows re search coordinators to establish multiple projects with defined digital content, develop and assign codebooks and surveys, and set-up permission based researcher profiles. Once the research proj ect is established within the system, custom codebooks and surv eys are created using a simple webform interface and presented in line with digital sources chosen for analysis. The combined presentation of the custom research instrument and the digital source material allow multiple researchers to assign codes, categor ies, ratings and notes in situ. Data entered by the researchers are linked to the source material and are saved to a local server for later download or ad hoc trend analysis. The immediate availability of aggregated data allows the comparison of coding submissions by all researchers. Early discrepancies between the reports of researchers can be identified and discussed to ensure consensus and the need for further clarification within the codebook. Data files can be downloaded in multiple formats for easy import into statistical analysis software, increasing the efficiency and coordination for the most complex protocols of digital content analysis. The development of Qbox followed a process in which user needs were thoroughly integrated with design thinking and execution. The development tasks emerged di rectly from conversations with the researchers who would be using the system to conduct their work. Since researcher needs were not entirely known from the This open-ended, iterative devel opment process was possible, in part, because of the underlying t echnologies used to create Qbox. Using Drupal, an open-source Content Management System, allowed the user experience team to move from conceptual design to full implementation in just a few weeks. Drupal was chosen for its strong development community, extensibility and fine-grained access controls. Primarily written in PHP, Drupal offers a great deal of flexibility in how it is implemented. Any major server environment can host the tool a nd most database systems, both open-source and commercial, are supported. The componentized modules integrated to make Qbox work have yielded an extensible and flexible system, adaptable to the needs of the researchers who use it as a tool to accomplish their goals. As need dictates design, Qbox will soon be available as a downloadable Drupal installation profile that can run on Linux, Mac OS or Windows platforms. The user-centered design of Qbox was initiated to help address particular challenges of an ongoing research project. This project involves investigating the role of hyperlinked citations to Wikipedia policies, guide lines and essays used to coordinate work and regulate editor behavior duri ng article talk page discussions. The goal of this study is to classify the different social motivations behind the creation of hyperlinked policy citations, particularly in cases where the citation is directed at other editors involved in the discussion. The re search team needed a way to quickly view and classify a data set of 1800 Wikipedia talk page comments (each identified by a unique URL) that contained these citations. Previous attempts to use data analysis and annotation tools such as Microsoft Excel, Atlas.ti, and the Coding Analysis Toolkit (CAT) had revealed critical limitations of these tools: some tools were not browse r-based, requiring a separate installation on every researcher X  X  computer; some did not facilitate viewing and annotation of the same source data by multiple researchers; and some did not allow easy, rapid iteration of the codebook as the researchers added new categories or refined category definitions. The concept behind Qbox was to provide a single browser based experience combining the researcher X  X  digital source content with codebook iterations. The first version of Qbox was developed quickly with little custom pr ogramming, using several common Drupal extensions. Researchers c ould log on independently of one another, analyze each comment in a sequential study page, refine coding categories, view browse r rendered results, and download output files. The most pressing challenge face d during the Wikipedia citation study was to organize 1800 URLs for analysis by multiple researchers. Setting up these kinds of high content studies can be a challenge in itself, often requiri ng hours of copy/paste drudgery. To ease the burden, Qbox was designed to leverage existing Drupal modules that fa cilitate automated content creation through the import of spreadsheet or delimited text files. This ability to load data automatically greatly reduced the amount of time, and effort, needed to prepare the study. It also allowed the use of external tools, such as Microsoft Excel, to create and manipulate the dataset before and after analyses. This initial challenge highlights how the tool design wa s influenced and improved in response to an immediate user need while maintaining existing project requirements and goals. An unanticipated requirement that developed during the Wikipedia citation study was the iterative refinement of the codebook, which occurred as two researchers collaborated to establish categorical definitions to ensure stable inter-coding reliability. Qbox X  X  design made this process easy. Codebooks were simply considered another type of content that could be quickly created and edited via Drupal X  X  Webform module. Any number of simple form elements could be combined to build a complex set of criteria to evaluate a subject page. More complex data gathering tools such as Likert scales and semantic differentials were built with very little effort. Because the codebook was treated as a type of content, authorized users were able to alter it as the need arose. Another significant challenge faced by the research team was finding a way for multiple researchers to interact with digital content in an organized manner. Qbox met this challenge by facilitating a common browser based online work environment. People with different research roles were able to interact with the Qbox tool simultaneously. Drupal X  s built in access control tools gave Qbox the important ability to structure the collaborative environment by precisely defining user roles and responsibilities. Study administrators were able to make global and page-level changes to the site X  X  content and architecture while research work continued. As a result, both de sign and data analysis became shared efforts, with researchers and designers in constant communication as new needs, ch allenges and possibilities emerged. Given the success of the user-centered design approach and the resulting tool X  X  impact on the associated research, future development will continue to be conducted in tandem with upcoming research projects. The next use of Qbox is scheduled to incorporate the classification of 100s of websites submitted by participants over the course of a multi-year survey when asked about which publicly available on line services (PAOSs) they use at work. This large, disparate set of websites, applications and services will be classified in Qbox according to their collaborative features, business models, de gree of public openness, and orientation toward different professional work domains. We intend to develop a typology of PAOSs that will allow us to track shifts in technology use by in formation workers over time and classify new technologies and serv ices as they emerge. Given the challenges with this unique data set it is expected that Qbox will be developed to accommodate In addition to anticipated uses in pending research, the flexibility of the tool X  X  design has generated in terest in other areas of digital content collaboration. Potential uses raised during recent technical reviews have included The user-centered design of Q box not only produced a flexible tool that can be used for future activities, it radically expedited and improved the research protocol of the study for which it was designed. Rigorous research and innovative design were mutually employed without detriment to either process, highlighting the effectiveness of the methodology.
