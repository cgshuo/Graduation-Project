Given a customer sequentially timestamped transactional database, with transactions of bought items rule mining algorithm proposed by Agrawal and Srikant [3]. This sequential pattern mining problem has a large number of applications, such as mining Welfare Services database [4], hence the problem traditional pattern mining approach with post knowledge engineering? has been posed. In this paper, sequential pattern approaches and then we discuss the shortcomings of each of these approaches. databases that feature time variants in the data accumulation process [5]. There are generally four categories of approaches to mining such sequential patterns: 1. The Apriori based horizontal data formatting approach es were introduced in the paper of Agrawal 2. The Apriori based vertical data formatting approaches were extensions of the ELCAT method 4. Approximation of sequential patterns [4,10,11] focuses on approximating patterns shared by other
The sequential pattern mining problem is also related to time series data analysis. Besides frequent sequential pattern mining, other challenges of time series data analysis include:  X  periodicity discovery [12]: to fi nd the set of values occurring in certain periodic pattern;  X  value prediction [13,14]: to predict unseen values based on the existing time series datasets;
Recent development of related sequential data mining approaches include the Rough Set based parti-cuss an ef fi cient method in mining sequence databases [25]; Development on mining constraint-based sequential patterns is described in [26]. 1.1. Issues with existing approaches is the overhead of huge candidate set generation and consequent database scanning for ordered lists of itemsets. The ApriorSome algorithm alleviates this issue by making some balance between doing frequent database scans and fi nding the maximality of large sequences. The ApriorSome algorithm large sequences regardless of maximality. However, this modi fi cation is not enough for achieving a comparable ef fi ciency to the Pre fi xSpan [8] method.

The DynamicSome algorithm generates the candidate set on-the-fl y. This algorithm has three phases horizonal data formatting approach. The SPADE algorithm [7] attempts to achieve mining ef fi ciency the memory space issues when mining large databases. The large sequences can then be found in each equivalent class. Other closely related practical problems can be found in [27 X 32].
The Pre fi xSpan approach [8] employs recursive computations in each projected databases with pre-method, the concept of S-matrix is introduced to represent intermediate results, we argue that it is overhead of databases which is not desirable.

One motivation of the work described in this paper is to develop a method which not only can be representing the knowledge [33,34] while preserving the complete set of sequential patterns. This is initiated an algorithmic foundation for such methods. H owever in [35], the performance issue, which the knowledge representation is not discussed. In this paper, we complete performance comparisons discuss the extension to enriched knowledge representation with the proposed method. We introduce two applicable knowledge representations: the Set Occurrence Table and Set Distance computations in and ad hoc analysis in the post mining stage. 1.2. Contributions
A generalized method for mining sequential patterns in sequential databases has been developed. The approach balances the tradeoff between the following benchmarks: 1. Mining performance. The Apriori based approaches, either in horizontal or vertical data format, 2. Knowledge representation. In projection based methods, the intermediate database projections can
To sum up the two main contributions of the approach presented in this paper are:  X  Both sequential pattern mining ef fi ciency and effectiveness are considered by avoiding multiple  X  A knowledge representation is introduced that allows development of further data engineering and
The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic terminology of the In Section 3, the performance issue of this approach is considered in comparison with other existing methods. In Section 4, applicable knowledge representations and post mining methods are introduced and a systematic sequential pattern mining procedure is derived. Section 5 discusses the use of the proposed approach in the biological domain through examples and using a case study on microRNA (miRNA). The paper concludes in Section 6 with some future research directions. 2. The set based approach 2.1. Terminology and problem de fi nition method are developed.
 timestamped they are known as itemset events .Let A = s 1 ,...,s n be a sequence of itemset events of the sequence. Given two sequences A = s 1 ,...,s n and B = t 1 ,...,t m ,where | A | = n and |
B | = m then A is a subsequence of B (denoted as A B ), or alternatively A is contained in B ,ifthere are n integers 1 i 1 &lt;i 2 &lt; ... &lt; i n m such that s 1  X  t i The length of a sequence is the number of items from all itemsets in the sequence. Hence, if cardinality of the itemset formed by the concatenation of all itemsets in A .

If A i , 1 i n ,are n sequences then we say D = { A 1 ,A 2 ,...,A n } is a sequence database. In ( SID i , A i ) tuples, where SID i is the unique sequence ID, and A i is a customer sequence. sequences in U that contain pattern P .
 In order to develop the improved method based on set theory, we introduce the following notations:  X  F ( U,  X  )= { P || P U | =  X  } , F ( U,  X  ) contains all the patterns that have support  X  in U . Based on the notations above, we have the following immediate set properties: 2.2. A sample sequential database To illustrate the development of the method, consider a sequentially time-stamped database where The time stamp is the order of the itemsets in the database.
 Hence, and where | means concatenation.
The above sequential database can be represented as a customer transactional database, as shown below: { 30,50,70 } in sequence 3.
 then in the transformation phase it transforms the customer sequences with the encoding. approach is designed to resolve these issues. 2.3. Computing V ( U, sup ) In this section, we fi rst introduce theoretical foundations of the set-based method. Proposition 1. If P  X  V ( U,  X  ) and Q is a subsequence of P ,then Q  X  V ( U,  X  ) . Proof 1. If Q P ,thenwehave P U  X  Q U .Let  X   X  P U , we want to show that  X   X  Q U .From  X   X  P U ,wehave P  X  . Then from Q P ,wehave Q  X  and it follows that  X   X  Q U . Hence if Q P and P  X  V ( U,  X  ) ,wehave Q  X  V ( U,  X  ) .
 From the above proposition, we can derive the following theorem.
 P 1  X  V ( U,  X , | P | X  1) and P 2  X  V ( U,  X , 1) .
 For example, if we set min sup to 2, from V ( U, 2 , 1) , we iterate to compute V ( U, 2 , 2) below: eration of the loop, V ( U, 2 , 3) becomes empty because none of the concatenations meet the support requirement of 2. Thus, we have V ( U, 2 ,l )=  X  for l&gt; 2 .The fi nal result is to output: 2.4. Compute V ( U, h ) for h &gt; sup property to devise Algorithm 2.
 By re-arranging, we have We present Algorithm 2 below: F ( U, 2) , hence we have V ( U, 3) as follows: In the same fashion, we have V ( U, 4) :
We can see that V ( U, 5) =  X  and Algorithm 2 terminates. 2.5. Compute MaxV ( U, h ) sequences in the customer sequences. For example, from V ( U, 2) ,MaxV ( U, 2) can be derived as: { 40 } and { 70 } . We give the following algorithm to compute MaxV ( U, h ) .
 For example, to derive MaxV ( U, 3) , the algorithm gives:
We can see that MaxV ( U, 3) = V ( U, 3) because sequences in V ( U, 3) are distinct, that is, the sequences do not have overlapping itemsets. The reason we are interested in the maximal frequent Further, we can derive association rules based on maximal frequent patterns since maximality renders A  X  B ,where A and B are itemsets in sequential pattern mining problems, we will overlook some 2 | non  X  MaxV ( U,h ) |  X  2 by the de fi nition of MaxV ( U, h ) in our approach. 3. Performance evaluation horizontal formatting approaches. Our method does not clearly outperform the Pre fi xSpan method at the mining stage, but we emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed approach due to the enriched knowledge representation in the next section.
 Allthe experiments were performed on 2.19 GHz IntelDuo Core 2 machine with 2GB RAMofmemory. numerical values as items and conduct experiments with MATLAB version 7.0, which is known to be ef fi cient in numerical computations.
 The following preparation steps were carried out prior to the performance evaluation:
Datasets generation  X  We generated numerical data sets in this step, the parameters used in context of customer transactional database are listed in Table 1.

Batch formation  X  After generating the datasets, we choose sample data batches similar to the data are crucial to evaluate the performance. The total transactions per item is approximately equal to ( |
To gauge the performance of our proposed method, we emphasize the advantageous fact that the set based approach makes fewer database scans compared with the Apriori based methods while preserving the complete set of sequential patterns.

We gather the performance statistics for the proposed set-based approach and other methods in Figs 1 support threshold ( min sup ), and vertical coordinates show the timing in secconds.
From the results, the set-based approach proposed in our investigation outperforms GSP , even with high minimum suppor t values, as we have avoided multiple scans of the datasets by set computations. based algorithms since a decreased minimum support threshold means more iterations being performed. Apriori based GSP approaches.
 methods perform similarly. However, the set based methods do not outperform the Pre fi xSpan method up proportionally. 4. Knowledge representation
Knowledge representation is important when mining sequential patterns. In this section, we discuss two instances of the enriched knowledge representation that are byproducts of the proposed set-based approach. This is followed by a systematic procedure for mining sequential patterns. 4.1. Occurrence tables
Guan et al. [36,37] proposed a tabular representation for mining sequential data sets such as DNA segments. The Sentence Occurrence Table and Sequence Occurrence Table are not tailored to mine and instantiate the use of it in the set theoretical framework.
 In the set based approach, the knowledge of sequential patterns can be summarized in an Occurrence Table of the following generalized form: de fi ned as: and 1 j | A | and 1 i n .

For the set based approach, the Set Occurrence Table corresponds to where h is the support of patterns of all possible lengths and further de fi ne
The Set Occurrence Table contains a summary of complete sequential patterns based on their support Table is generated upon completion of the mining process:  X  X ecomposed X .

The transpose of the above set occurrence table is called the Information System and it takes the following form: making process. In the context of rough set theory [38,39], associations have rule-based formats is the decision class label.

With rough set approximation theory and other computational paradigms that bridge the knowledge mining stage. 4.1.1. Association rules knowledge representation, this association rule mining can be performed with the aid of rough set
This knowledge representation is derived from the proposed set-based sequential mining procedure V a is the domain of each feature in A and f a is a mapping function or information function that maps each object in U to the domain of the object, that is, f a : U  X  V a .
 IND ( P ) for  X  P  X  A and some feature a is de fi ned as: In other words, two objects are equivalent if and only if they have the same attribute values. If P = { a 1 ,a 2 ,...,a n } , then a partition U/IND ( P ) generated by IND ( P ) is de fi ned as: where is de fi ned as and a P-upper approximation is de fi ned as By this de fi nition, we can see that the P-lower approximation is a more conservative measurement compared to the P-upper approximation. From this, we can de fi ne a rough set ( P X, PX ) . For example, a well-known rough set based association rule mining algorithm is LEM2 ( L earning From E xamples M odule Version 2) was proposed by Grzymala-Busse [40]. The main idea is to include the Interested readers should refer to [39] for concrete application examples. 4.1.2. Feature selection
Another important use of our enriched knowledge representation in the post sequential pattern mining which has profound applications in many domains. For example, in computational biology, feature
Given input data with N samples and M features or attributes expressed in the feature set X = { x the selection process need to be leveraged.
 place. Therefore, our previously de fi ned knowledge representation comes naturally into use without best characterizes all the original frequent sequential patterns.
 procedure based on mutual information that considers both maximal dependance and maximal redundan-(D) and redundancy (R) [44] simultaneously with and I ( . ) is the mutual information involving random variables x, y and their pdf, de fi ned as knowledge representation, this computational cost is saved. 4.2. Distance measures
By using this knowledge representation, a distance between any two objects u i and u j in a set occurrence table T can be computed by de fi ning the object set distance as:
Similarly, the distance between any two itemsets a i and a j in an Information System, T , can be computed by de fi ning the itemset distance as:
By computing the set distance, the knowledge of frequent discrepancy of any two events can be can be easily derived with the above de fi nition and knowledge representation.
 This  X  is called the tolerance interval , and it is user-dependent.
 Set Occurrence Table to T , denoted as
This notion of indiscernible Set Occurrence Table is particularly useful when ad hoc analysis is include: what will be the impact of introducing a new alternative item or what will be the customer behavior if some items are made temporarily unavailable? To answer this type of questions, we use Algorithm 4 below.

In other words, given itemsets purchased by different customers in a timely fashion, and we are to investigate how successful are newly introduced itemsets on the shelf. Give some threshold that is not properly shelved for well established purchase bundles. Conversely, if some itemsets are made purchased bundles.
 4.3. A sequential mining procedure procedure is depicted in Algorithm 5. 4.4. Complexity of the Set Occurrence Table depends on prede fi ned min sup ; to quantify this dimension, we exhaust values of h&gt;min sup as in Algorithm 2. Under most circumstances, the Set Occurrence Tables are needed to store the Set Occurrence Tables are substantially less than the upper bound. by the intermediate output of the pattern mining phase. 5. Experiments In this section, we exemplify the use of the proposed methods by analyzing biological DNA sequences. A group of DNA sequences can be seen as a collection of sequential transactions in customer-alike all the reported miRNA sequences which are found to have critical links with diseases like cancer in post-transcription phase using the proposed methods and enriched knowledge representations. 5.1. A simple example
A DNA sequence is formed by nucleotides A ( Adenine ) ,C ( Cytosine ) ,G ( Guanine ) ,T ( Thymine ) u .
 Example 1 [36] Consider a database consisting of four DNA sequences of length 32, and let U = { u 1 ,u 2 ,u 3 ,u 4 } ,where tally as follows: = { CC, GC, AGT C, GT CACAC, ACGT AAAA, CACACAGT, CGT AAAAGT } . To build a knowledge-base system, we form the Set Occurrence Table using maximal frequent patterns as fol-lows: power in distinguishing motifs towards decision, which is modeled by an extra decision variable from domain experts. To simplify our discussion, we append decision variable D as: instance of association rules from the example database is: IF dinucleotide GC is present in V ( U, 4) THEN D =1 .
 OTHERWISE D =0 .
 miRNA sequences in the next section. 5.2. Scaling-up: a miRNA study
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) form a family of small non-coding RNAs of  X  21 nucleotides in length, and are Recent computational studies include new miRNA prediction [47], target prediction [48], interaction perspective through the proposed ad hoc analysis in Algorithm 4.
The data set consists of 15632 mature miRNA sequences from miRBase [50]. For compact represen-tation, assume we incrementally fi nd two motifs of interest: AUGACUUGCC and CCAAGGAUGA. To investigate how sensitive are these motifs with new sequences, we split the data set into 64% X 36% Set Occurrence Tables are shown in Figs 6 and 7.

Figures 6 and 7 show that certain candidate motifs are more sensitive to new sequences. For example, motifs (rows) AUGA an d CCAAGG differ in T and T . The entry difference between T and T is most informative against the decision variable with regard to the chosen candidate motifs. 6. Conclusions
This paper has presented a set of algorithms for mining frequent sequential patterns in customer Apriori based methods in that the new methods employ set computations and avoids multiple database scans while preserving the complete set of sequential patterns.
 has been shown for such enriched knowledge representation with two useful instances, namely the set occurrence table and set distance computation. These knowledge representations are informative for aligning other computational methods for further explorations, demonstrated by rough set based
A systematic procedure has also been presented for integrating the proposed set based approach in mining sequential patterns with the enriched knowledge representations, thus a complete mining framework is formed.
