 In this paper, we propose a novel approach for measuring similarity between web objects. Our similarity measure is defined based on the representation of a web object as a collection of tags. Precisely, we first construct a vector space in which multiple terms are mapped into a single di mension by using information available from Open Directory Project and Delicious.com. Then we position web objects in the vector space and apply the traditional cosine measure for similarity computation. We demonstrate that the proposed si milarity computation method is able to overcome the limitation of traditional vector space approach while at the same time require less computational cost compares to LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing).

Collaborative tagging allows users to freely attach tags to a web object, and it has become popular in the web environment. Tags attached to a web object can be considered as metadata characterizing the object through utilizing social wisdom [3]. With this observation, we propos e a novel approach to compute similarity between web objects by constructing a vector space that considers a group of tags instead of an individual term as a dimension candidate. For the sel ection of tags, we use data available from ODP (Open Director y Project) and Delicious.com. The objective of the proposed a pproach is to achieve better similarity computation results than traditional vector space model without requiring too much computational cost. Section 2 and then introduce proposed approach in Section 3. Next, experimental results are pr ovided in Section 4. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 5 In vector space model, each dimension corresponds to a separate term, and each document is positioned in the vector space according to the terms it contains [2]. In our problem, tags correspond to terms while obj ects correspond to documents. Unfortunately, due to the word mismatch problem, direct application of traditional similar ity measures under this vector space representation would result in unsatisfactory results. For instance, cosine similarity value between two objects respectively tagged as  X  X utomobile X  and  X  X ar X  would be 0. In order to address this limita tion, several dimension reduction methods have been proposed. In particular, LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) attempts to extract latent semantics through singular vector decomposition. Yet, high co mputational cost of LSI makes it difficult to be applied when data volume is huge. With this motivation, the proposed approach aims to provide a computationally efficient met hod to measure the similarity between web objects while successfully addressing the limitation of the vector space model. ODP provides hierarchical classi fication of various web objects through directory. Table 1 shows an example of directory names extracted from directories located at different levels. In the proposed approach, the v ector space is constructed as follows. First, each dimension in the space is mapped to a representative keyword selected from ODP directory names that chosen from the same directory level. For example, if we use the 1 level in Table 1,  X  X usic X ,  X  X rts X  and  X  X ports X  should be selected together as representative keywords for the axes. Figure 1 shows an example of such vector space. Second, each representative keywor d is further enriched through introducing a relevant bag of terms based on co-occurrence information gathered from Delicious.com. Specifically, we use web objects with multiple tags in Delicious.com to find co-occurred terms with representative keywords for web objects. Then, for each representative keyword, the bag is constructed by adding co-occurred terms with their respective frequencies observed across all the web objects tagged with the keyword. For example, the axis  X  X ports X  of Fi gure 1 is represented as bag of terms {basketball, figurer, 2advertisement} from the fact that there are objects tagged {Sports, ba sketball} and {Sports, figurer}, advertisement} in Delicious.com. Third, we construct a tag set for representing a web object by aggregating all the tags annotated for the same object across the users. If different users use the same tag to annotate the same object, the frequency of the tag is considered. For example, one user may annotate  X  X dvertise X  and  X  X riticism X  for an object and another user may annotate  X  X riticism X  for the same object, then this object would be represented by {advertisement, 2criticism}. Finally, we position a web object in the vector space by testing its individual tag X  X  membership with respect to the bag of terms member of the bag for an axis, th en the object X  X  coordinate with respect to the axis becomes tag frequency of the object multiplied by the frequency of the term in the bag. More formally, let T={t t express object o i and an axis a k in the tag vector space as: where f ij is the frequency of t j for o i and h kj is the frequency of t for a k . Then the coordinate of object o i in A, o i ' can be expressed as: As an example, consider a web object with tags  X  X dvertisement X  and two  X  X riticism X  X . As shown in Figure 1, its coordinates become (4, 5, 2) since  X  X riticism X  appears in  X  X usic X  and  X  X rts X  two times and  X  X dvertisement X  app ears in  X  X rts X  and  X  X ports X  one and two times respectively in its ba g. Finally the two vectors (4, 4, 0) and (0, 1, 2) are added, resulting in (4, 5, 2). For the experimentation, we used the data collected from Delicious.com during September, 2008, which consist of 190,876 URLs, 76,439 tags, and 4,308 users. Only the URLs that exist in both ODP and Delicious.com are ra ndomly selected as test data. We decide to use 3 rd level of ODP directory names as vector space axes, because 3 rd level of ODP directory names shows slightly better performance than others in our test. For the purpose of assessing the performance of the proposed approach, we select an URL (denoted as X) and compute its similarity against all the other URLs in the test set. Top-N similar URLs to X were obtained according to their similarity values. Subsequently, the performance is measured by counting how many URLs out of top-N belong to the directory X is located in. The underlying assumption is that the URLs contained in the same directory are more similar to each other than those in different directories [1]. We set N = 49 and compared the proposed approach with the trad itional cosine measure and LSI. Figure 2 shows the performance results for the case in which the 3rd level directory URLs were used as test set (indicated as CS3 in Figure 2). As shown in Figure 2, experimental results show that our approach outperforms the other methods. The best performance gain over the other methods was observed for  X  X nternet X  directory. We proposed a method for enhancing the performance of the traditional vector space approach to similarity computation. The proposed method allows multiple terms to be mapped into a single dimension in the space, resulting in a more enriched term space in which the limitation imposed by term orthogonality can be addressed. Our method require s less computational efforts compared to LSI. Furthermore, experimental results show that it outperformed the other approach es for the application domain considered.
