 Social Media (SM) has become a valuable information source to many in diverse situations. In IR, research has focused on real-time aspects and as such little is known about how long SM content is of value to users, if and how often it is re-accessed, the strategies people employ to re-access and if difficulties are experienced while doing so. We present re-sults from a 5 month-long naturalistic, log-based study of user interaction with Twitter, which suggest re-finding to be a regular activity and that Tweets can offer utility for longer than one might think. We shed light on re-finding strategies revealing that remembered people are used as a stepping stone to Tweets rather than searching for content directly. Bookmarking strategies reported in the literature are used infrequently as a means to re-access. Finally, we show that by using statistical modelling it is possible to pre-dict if a Tweet has future utility and is likely to be re-found. Our findings have implications for the design of social media search systems and interfaces, in particular for Twitter, to better support users re-find previously seen content.
Information re-finding is the behaviour exhibited to access previously seen or possessed information [27]. People regu-larly re-find items of different kinds including documents [12], emails [50], photos and web pages [42, 5, 44] and in these contexts re-finding can be a frustrating, time consum-ing and expensive task [27]. It is less clear if re-finding is so pervasive and challenging within social media applications (SMA) where the focus is often on real-time information [47] and information exchange [33] and where much of the content has been identified as disposable,  X  X indless babble X  [25].

Nevertheless, some SMAs have features explicitly designed to prolong content lifespans. Examples include retweeting (RT) and the heart icon (formerly star) on Twitter. A RT allows users to forward Tweets to their followers and places these amongst the user X  X  sent messages -a separate space c  X  from which a Tweet may be located. The heart icon labels a Tweet as a  X  X avourite X  (FAV) and again places the message in a separate space. Studies have confirmed that both features are indeed used with the intention of preserving [3, 32]. New features have recently been added to SMAs to help users re-turn to previously viewed content e.g. Facebook has the  X  X ead it later X  button and Whatsapp has introduced a star icon. Moreover, as of November 2014 Twitter offers users the ability to search over the complete dataset of Tweets, unre-stricted by age. Investigations of Twitter search behaviour do provide some evidence of re-finding [15]. Nevertheless, in transaction log studies of SM search behaviour, interactions often associated with re-finding (e.g. repeated queries) have been attributed instead to monitoring behaviour due to the perception of SM posts as a shallow, ephemeral media [47].
Thus there is uncertainty in the literature with respect to the frequency with which SM content is re-found and the lifespans of posts for individual users. Moreover little is known about how users re-find content on SMAs, the diffi-culties they experience or the support they require. In this paper we contribute by reporting the results of a natural-istic, log-based investigation of user interactions with the Twitter website. Our specific contributions are as follows:
We overview three research areas of relevance to our work: (i) Twitter behaviour studies informing on the life-cycle of Tweets. (ii) Re-finding behaviour in disparate domains as well as related personal information management (PIM) ac-tivities. (iii) Studies investigating PIM behaviour on Twit-ter, which links (i) and (ii) and motivates our specific re-search questions. (i) Insights into Life-cycle of Tweets: Twitter is used for diverse purposes including conversing [22], shar-ing thoughts [33], monitoring topics for up-to-date informa-tion [29], establishing social capital [24] and even political mobilisation [6]. None of these use cases, however, suggest that the distributed content holds any long-term utility for Tweet consumers and Twitter X  X  emphasis on the present, the popular and the ephemeral has been well documented [38]. Twitter creator Jack Dorsey underlined the ephemerality of his service, stating:  X  X I] don X  X  go back in time. You X  X e kind of as good as your last update. X  1 .

The RT feature can extend the global life-cycle of a Tweet by propagating it over the network [29]. This means that even very old content can enter a user X  X  timeline in the same way as new Tweets. Although half of all RTs occur within a day, 10% of RTs do take place at least one month later [29] with the probability decreasing with time from the Tweet X  X  arrival in a user X  X  Timeline [29, 21]. One reason for this is that a Tweet X  X  visibility to a user decreases rapidly -a major barrier to information propagation leading to short Tweet life-cycles overall [21]. Several other features have been identified as good predictors for whether or not a Tweet will be RT X  X  including social attributes of the users involved, e.g. number of followers, number of followees and how often the user has been added to lists; as well as presence of URLs and hashtags in Tweets [36, 23, 41]. Thus, although the life-cycle of Tweets is typically short, Tweets can have long life-cycles over several Twitter users 2 , but it is unclear how long Tweets are useful for individual users. (ii) Personal Information Management (PIM) is the field concerned with behaviours related to the manage-ment of information [27]. Those most pertinent to our work are 1) re-finding, for which the literature describes strategies people employ, identifies patterns in re-finding behaviour, difficulties they have and the system features that can help and 2) the keeping decision, which influences what people will remember about their information and consequently, how it will be re-found [42, 12, 44, 14, 4].

Prominent re-finding strategies are orienteering and tele-porting [1, 37, 45]. The former utilises recognition by nav-igating spatially or by using contextual information to nar-row in on the sought-after information. It can consist of a series of different browsing and searching actions. The lat-ter involves recalling detailed information about an item to navigate to it directly e.g. typing the URL of a web page into the browser or submitting elaborate search queries. The strategy employed will be influenced by numerous factors in-cluding the type of item (e.g. email vs web page), elapsed time between access and re-access and previously applied keeping decisions and re-finding actions [7].

The decision to keep information can be error prone as it depends on a user X  X  ability to anticipate personal future information needs [4] and the value of encountered informa-tion is often only realised long after it has been initially seen (post-valued recall) [49]. Although keeping actions can sup-port later re-finding, often users decide not to keep and rely http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/02/jack-dorsey-on.html
Even the first ever Tweet posted featured in our logs. on search systems for re-access and this can be problematic [5]. Keeping information is not a guaranteed solution ei-ther, however, as people often forget that they did so [26], cannot recall where they stored the information or the or-ganisational structures fail [50, 12, 14]. Re-finding can be supported algorithmically [39, 8] or with interactive features, such as search histories [28], changes to the appearance or ordering of results [43, 46] or different organisational struc-tures based on e.g. tagging [9]. (iii) PIM on Twitter: Only recently have researchers turned to Twitter as an object of study in PIM. An inves-tigation of motivations for RTing showed that the feature is important not only for message propogation, but also for extending a Tweet X  X  personal life-cycle with users reporting RTing to preserve Tweets [3]. A similar study of favouriting revealed 25 motivations including bookmarking, either with an anticipated need in mind or with the aim of building a personal collection [32]. Researchers have also attempted to predict whether a favourited Tweet was for liking, book-marking, self-promotion, as part of a conversation or grati-tude [18].

Re-finding on Twitter can be frustrating, primarily for very active users who follow many accounts and who typi-cally take steps to preserve Tweets of interest [31]. Teevan et al. [47] analysed Twitter search query logs captured via the Bing toolbar. Repeated queries -which in other contexts are attributed to re-finding -were interpreted as monitoring. However, the same authors later note that older posts can be of value to users, but as the Twitter search only returns the most recent Tweets, searching for older Tweets occurs infrequently [13]. A long term diary study found that 40% of users reported reasons for using the search function are related to finding previously viewed information [15].
With Twitter now a valuable source of information to many a certain research deficit exists as we lack a detailed understanding of keeping and re-finding practices on this platform. Our study aims to address this by investigating personal Tweet life-cycles, keeping and re-finding strategies, and features of Tweets that make them candidates for re-finding.
Although the Twitter API offers a simple and cost-effective way to source behavioural data, the data is limited to traces resulting from active engagement with certain features of the service e.g. RTing. In this work, we collect a much richer and complete naturalistic data-set by also account-ing for more latent Twitter usage e.g. stream consumption (reading and clicking Tweets) and sub-page navigation.
We developed a Chrome web-browser extension to col-lect user interactions with the Twitter website. The ex-tension logged metadata from Tweets viewed or interacted with (moused-over, clicked on, FAV X  X , RT X  X  etc.) and the context in which the interaction took place (i.e. personal timeline ( Timline Event ), another user X  X  profile page ( User-Profile Event ), search results page ( Search Event ), on the favourite X  X  list ( Favourites Event ) etc.). Interactions, such as search queries, mouse movement and scrolling were also recorded. ( n=27) min max mean median Tw eets(n) 0 73 780 5637 59 Following Count(n) 4 1041 203 57 Follower Count(n) 0 1139 202.5 39 Favourites Count(n) 0 44520 1796 18.50 Registered (years) (NA=12) 2 6 4.6 5
Participants were recruited in various ways including ad-vertising on Twitter, mailing lists and posts on diverse In-ternet fora. Over a five month period, lasting from the end of March to the end of August 2015, 44 Twitter users down-loaded and installed the extension. We could establish back-ground information for 27 of these users as we were able to reliably map these to an Twitter account 3 . However all 44 subjects feature in the analyses.

Achieving a representative sample of Twitter users with this kind of study is close to impossible. Our aim was rather to achieve a sample as large and diverse as possible to pro-vide insight into the re-finding practices of a relatively het-erogeneous group of users. Table 1 summarises basic par-ticipant account statistics, indicating a reasonably diverse sample in terms of how and how often they use Twitter. Although we did not survey participants for demographic information, examining their accounts reveals divergent ed-ucational backgrounds, work situations and users based in many countries, prominently in Germany, USA and the UK.
Applying 5 minutes inactivity as session threshold as in previous social media studies [40] resulted in a total of 4573 sessions for all users. The number of events per session ranges from 2 to 2155 (median=11, IQR=31). A session lasted on average slightly over 4 minutes but the longest session lasted over 3 hours (median=83sec, IQR=270sec). These figures are in line with session characteristics reported in other social media log studies [40, 2]. The number of events per session and session duration are highly correlated (Pearson r=0.90) indicating that participants were typically very engaged when using Twitter.

Figures 1(a)-(d) present an overview of general session behaviour: (a) examines the average session length per user and shows that for 50% of users the average session lasted 320sec or longer. (b) shows that the number of sessions
Identification required the user to visit their own profile page. Participants consented to establishing background in-formation via the API. per user varies greatly; the sharp slope indicating a heavy long-tailed distribution. 75% of participants completed 46 sessions or less. For about 80% of participants, the average number of events per session completed (shown in (c)) was below 100 events and peaks at around 300. Finally (d) indi-cates that 40% of participants performed 1 session per day on average, a quarter of participants completed 2 or more sessions and the maximum number of sessions per day was 10. These plots underline very different patterns of usage across participants.

Most events occurred in the context of participants X  home timeline (72.40%). The second most common context was the profile site of other users (10.10% ) followed by the noti-fications page (7.50%). Other contexts/event categories fea-tured infrequently. Only 3.05% of events were search events or occurred on the Twitter SERP page and even fewer come from favourites lists (0.30%). In fact only 8 participants (18.20%) visited their favourites list at all. This aligns with the findings of a previous study where users reported rarely or never examining their favourites [32].

In total 143,721 unique Tweets appear in the logs. 273,550 references to these were collected, of which 146,735 are unique user-tweets (i.e. the same Tweet was counted twice if it ap-peared in the logs of two users). Of such Tweets, 3.76% received a special interaction (FAV=3.10%, RT=0.24%, RT+FAV=0.35%). Again, stark differences in behaviour can be observed across users. 23 (52.27%) participants FAV X  X  or RT X  X . Twitter feature usage can be heavily skewed, e.g. 4,186 (83.00%) favouriting actions were performed by a sin-gle, dominant user. The same user had by a considerable margin the highest number of favourited Tweets (Table 1).
The average age of a viewed Tweet was 28.1 hours (me-dian=1.44 hours, max=80667 hours (9 years), IQR=11.02 hours). These statistics indicate that Twitter is perhaps not as real-time as people may think. Figure 2 plots the age of Tweets when viewed, showing that 52,340 (19.13%) Tweets were not viewed within a day of being posted. Although the vast majority of Tweets are fresh (orange points) -as would be expected with a real-time platform -a good number of Tweets are in fact relatively old when viewed. This is a first hint that certain Tweets may have an extended life-cycle.
The analyses in this section demonstrate: 1) diverse be-haviour across participants, 2) that users spend most time on their own timelines and rarely access their favourites list or own profile, 3) that users interact with old Tweets -a first clue that re-finding may occur. The following sections analyse various aspects of re-finding. First, by comparing different proxies for the behaviour, we examine its frequency and how it varies across the partici-pants. Next we look at temporal patterns in Tweet re-access. Finally, we look at re-finding behaviour in detail by exam-ining the differences between re-finding and non-re-finding sessions and analysing the steps involved.
Several methods for identifying re-finding behaviour in naturalistic log data have been reported in the literature: using interaction sequences as a proxy [44, 48, 19], super-vised learning approaches with a manually annotated train-ing set [16] and pairing repeated session goals as produced by a classifier [39]. We employ the approach taken in equiv-alent early studies in web search, that is we utilise particular interaction patterns as a proxy for re-finding [44, 48]. We investigate several proxies before settling on the conserva-tive approach of examining instances of repeated clicks on Tweets.

Table 2 shows that only  X  30% of all Tweets that appeared on the participants X  timeline were interacted with explicitly and 12% of these receive a special interaction. This could mean that many Tweets are never read or that the content of many Tweets requires no mouse-over or click in order to be consumed. Interpreting the logs in this second manner would mean that many of the older Tweets in Figure 2 could be treated as re-finding, although it is difficult to say which. Classifying viewed Tweets older than the median age would result in 25.30% of all seen as being re-found with 93.18% of participants doing this at some point during the study. This is an extremely liberal proxy and would very likely over-estimate the frequency with which re-finding occurs.
A more accurate proxy is to consider Tweets that were ex-plicitly interacted with multiple times across sessions. 11% of the interacted-with Tweets were interacted with again in a future session. Taking cross-session interactions as a proxy for re-finding means that 34 (77%) participants can be con-sidered to have re-found at some point in the study with the proportion of their Tweets being re-found varying from 0.43% to 30%. On average 10.13% of Tweets are interacted-with across sessions. Again this probably over-estimates the frequency of re-finding. For instance users with a low Table 2: The proxies re-interacted and re-click in detail. SI stands for special interaction i.e. Tweets that got RT X  X  or FAV X  X . number of followers may implicitly mouse-over older Tweets due to a lack of new content in their stream and several re-interactions may result from a single re-finding intention.
A further method of identifying re-finding in the logs is to use a repeated click pair across sessions as has been used in web [44, 48], email [19] and desktop search contexts [12]. In streamed data like Twitter, where there is a heavy focus on the newest information, it is also a comparatively conserva-tive proxy as it is very unlikely that users accidentally click on an older message that they have previously clicked on as part of general interactions with the service.

Using this proxy 17 participants (38.64%) re-find and they do so with varying frequency (1.29% -15.35% of clicked Tweets are re-clicked in a future session). Using re-clicks as a proxy results in 276 re-finding actions of 219 unique Tweets across 176 different sessions. This indicates that re-finding sessions can contain multiple instances of re-finding and some Tweets (55) can be re-accessed several times across multiple sessions (median=2, max=3).

We have presented three different proxies that can be used to identify re-finding. Figure 3 summarises what these show regarding the frequency of re-finding sessions, tweets and users. The most conservative proxy reduces false positives, but comes at the cost of missing many potential re-finding actions as 95% of Tweets were not clicked at all and thus cannot be identified as being re-found using this approach. The true re-finding frequency probably lies within the range suggested by the three proxies. Nevertheless we focus on repeated clicks beyond sessions in the remainder of the pa-per as when describing re-finding behaviour, we want to be as sure as possible that what we are describing is indeed re-finding. Figure 3 shows that taking re-clicks as a proxy dramatically reduces the number of re-finding instances to Figure 3: The three proxies (age, re-interaction across sessions and re-click across sessions) in com-parison of number of re-finding sessions, Tweets re-found and users re-finding. investigate. Nevertheless, even this conservative proxy sug-gests re-finding to be a pervasive activity affecting over one third of the users. The period between the first click and a re-click on a Tweet sheds light on the personal life-cycle of re-accessed Tweets i.e. the period for which the Tweet or its content has utility to an individual user. Figure 4 shows that the personal life-cycle of a Tweet is typically short: half of all re-finding actions happen within a day (median time between click and re-click = 18.8 hours, mean=217 hours (9 days)). The longest personal life-cycle in our logs was 52 days, which we find surprisingly long for a medium known as ephemeral and suggests that Twitter content can hold utility several weeks after it is first encountered. Many repeated clicks happen within one day, yet the period between 1 day and 1 week shows far fewer clicks. Once a period of a week has past the frequency of re-clicks rises again. Moreover Figure 4 illustrates how special interactions and re-finding period re-late. Different point colours show whether or not re-clicked Tweets were FAV X  X  or RT X  X . The percentage of specially interacted Tweets is very high in the short re-click period group (61.60%), whereas in the long re-click period group this is not the case (10.44%).

Previous work has suggested that both RT and FAV are signs of relevance [36] and used as a means to  X  X ookmark X  a Tweet for future use. Intuitively, therefore, one would as-sume that Tweets interacted with in these ways would be more likely to be re-found across a longer time period com-pared to Tweets not marked as a FAV or RT X  X . Figure 4 indicates the opposite to be the case. The proportion of Tweets (61.60%) with special interaction amongst Tweets with a short re-click period ( &lt; median) is much higher than the proportion among Tweets (10.44%) that are re-clicked after a long period ( &gt; median). A chi-square test confirms this relationship, showing a highly significant effect of spe-cial interaction on re-click period (  X  2 =77.18, df=1, p &lt; 0.05,  X  =0.536, Odds-Ratio: 14). The odds ratio indicates the chance of a Tweet being re-clicked after a long re-click pe-riod is 14 times higher for Tweets which have not been FAV X  X  and/or RT X  X . The results suggest that users seem to favourite and/or re-tweet a Tweet whose relevance is imme-diately obvious and short-term, but struggle with assessing the future utility of encountered Tweets over longer periods.
We examine re-finding behaviour in 3 stages. We start by comparing re-finding with non-re-finding sessions. Next we investigate re-finding strategies by analysing the contexts in which Tweets are re-clicked. Here we discover that re-finding via user profile pages is a common strategy. Therefore, in a final step, we look more closely at how participants navigate to user profiles. This provides insight into what people re-member about sought-after Tweets and how they make use of these recollections when re-finding.
To discover how re-finding differs from typical Twitter us-age we compare the 176 re-finding sessions with 176 ran-domly sampled non-re-finding sessions. Using appropriate (Bonferroni corrected) non-parametric tests revealed 34 ses-sion features with significantly differing distributions. Re-finding sessions are longer in terms of session duration (492 secs vs 76), have more events in general (75.81 vs 29.66) and more search interactions (2.17 vs 0.37). Moreover, in-teractions were more likely to be in contexts other than the home timeline. During re-finding sessions more Tweets were viewed (75.51 vs 28.70), hovered over (16.24 vs 9.35) and clicked (5.14 vs 1.24). Also, relating to heavy down-ward scrolling (10416.44 px vs 5322.73) and mouse move-ment, participants tended to view Tweets much deeper in the timeline (25.62 vs 11.87) and consequently encounter older Tweets. The average age of a Tweet viewed in a re-finding session was typically much older than in non-refinding sessions (11.60 days vs 7.50). Finally, during re-finding sessions more user profiles are visited (0.75 vs 0.28) raising the questions of why this is the case and how users achieve this.

In summary, re-finding sessions are longer and contain more extensive and more varied behaviour. The analyses paint the picture of re-finding being much harder work than normal Twitter use.
Here we characterise re-finding by looking at the different contexts in which re-clicks on Tweets occur. This relates to the strategies people employ.

As in Section 5.2, we divide the re-clicked Tweets in short re-click period ( &lt; median) and long re-click period ( &gt; me-dian) and examine the URL in which the re-clicks take place. Figure 5 shows the distribution of re-click contexts. In short re-click periods the dominant context is the Timeline (65%), illustrating that often users need not leave their own stream to re-access content. This also means, however, that if a Figure 5: Comparison of different re-click contexts corresponding to re-finding strategies for short and long re-click periods. large number of active users are followed and if some time has passed since the Tweet was last seen, the user will be required to scroll a lot. This aligns with the findings in Sec-tion 5.3.1 where re-finding sessions were shown to contain significantly more scrolling. 25% of Tweets are re-accessed via the Notifications page. Other re-access strategies, such as keyword search (2.1%) or strategies that require certain preserving behaviour upfront e.g. FAVing (2.1%) or RTing (1.4%) are infrequently used. Thus, even if people are able to correctly predict they will need a Tweet in the future and bookmark -which Section 5.2 suggests to sometimes be the case for short time periods -they rarely make use of the bookmark when re-accessing.

The pattern changes dramatically for Tweets with a long re-click period. Re-finding via the notifications page or the Timeline decrease to  X  5%. Re-finding Tweets via the favourites list (2.9%) stays fairly constant, whereas search drops below 1%. In contrast re-finding via the own posted Tweets increases to about 5%. The context in which almost all Tweets get re-clicked, however, is another user X  X  profile page with 78.9% of re-accesses occurring in this context. This is of note as it suggests users associate Tweets with the author or poster of a Tweet or at least have a vague idea of who might have posted it. The fact that the author or sender of an information item is well remembered is known from previous PIM studies [12, 16] including on Twitter [10].
Surprisingly, it seems features designed to prolong Tweet life-cycles, such as FAVing and RTing are not the contexts in which Tweets are re-found. Instead Tweets tend to be re-accessed by scrolling either on the home timeline (after short periods) or another user X  X  timeline (after long periods).
Next, we look more closely at the paths people take to re-access Tweets. We do this by examining bi-gram events, i.e. two consecutive actions occurring prior to a user profile visit which, as we saw previously, was the most common context in which Tweets were re-accessed after longer time periods.
Table 3 shows the top 5 bi-gram events preceding a user profile event in re-finding sessions. The most frequent bi-gram is a home timeline visit followed by a search query. 30% of profile visits are proceeded by a search event. This suggests that although re-clicks did not occur in search con-texts, search is still important as it is used to locate people associated with the sought-after information. Users exhibit orienteering behaviour, narrowing down on the information source by searching for the user, before browsing through the user X  X  posted Tweets to re-find the desired Tweet. This fits the well known phenomenon in information seeking that people prefer to locate information via other people [20].
The remaining bi-grams all share one common event: the profile summary view. 4 By clicking on a mention or the Tweet author name the profile summary view is the link leading a participant to a user X  X  complete profile and his posted Tweets. This shows participants X  use of navigational links i.e. orienteering to get to user profiles. Overall 70% of bi-grams can be attributed as link-based orienteering solely relying on a browsing strategy.
In September 2015 (shortly after our study ended) the pro-file summary view of users was replaced with a hover effect showing user details.

PSV, Click on  X  X omplete profile X  button 9% (N=3) Table 3: Top 5 bi-grams events preceding a user pro-file event. PSV stands for profile summary viewed.
Section 5.1 showed that even on SMAs, which focus on real-time information, the re-finding of older information is prevalent and Tweets can offer utility for long time periods. The literature suggests that regardless of domain, re-finding can be challenging and frustrating [14, 31, 39] and the results in Section 5.3.1 seem to support this. Section 5.3.3 showed that teleporting strategies (e.g. searching directly to re-find Tweets) are almost never applied. Instead orienteering is preferred to narrow down on desired content. Orienteering can be search-based , where users submit queries to navigate to a specific context before browsing or link-based , where existing hypertext links are followed to navigate stepwise.
As users struggle with assessing the future utility of Tweets, we wanted to test how effective automated algorithms can be at predicting which Tweets will be re-clicked in the future.
We perform modelling experiments framed as a binary classification problem where the positive class consists of 217 of the re-clicked Tweets analysed above 5 . To attain 217 Tweets in the negative class we first randomly draw 100 clicked Tweets from each user who re-clicked a Tweet during the study. This is important as we do not want to bias the sample by including too many clicks from users who did not re-click at all. We then sample 217 non-re-clicked Tweets randomly from this set. 15 models are compared with varying degrees of com-plexity, in terms of the number of predictive features and the costs incurred in obtaining these features. 10-fold-cross-validation is performed on every iteration using a Random Forest classifier, as it has proven to be robust for classifica-tion problems [17]. We also experimented with other clas-sifiers including SVM, but none of these resulted in better performance. Therefore only results from the Random For-est experiments are reported, specifying F1, accuracy and the area under the ROC curve (AUC).
In our modelling we used four groups of predictive features (listed in detail in Table 4):
Tweet features describe general characteristics of Tweets with respect to their text ( CharCount, WordCount ), part of speech information ( POSTags ) [35] and use of Twitter features ( HashtagCount, MentionCount, LinkCount, max-FAVCount, maxRTCount ). Moreover we algorithmically as-2 of the Tweets were deleted and it is impossible to derive many of the features detailed below sessed a Tweet X  X  sentiment 6 ( sentiment.score ) and readabil-ity 7 ( readability.score ), as well as its type as established by human coders (Cohens Kappa: 0.48). The five content cate-gories were slightly adapted from [11]: Conversational, Sta-tus Message, News Providing, Broadcasting, Unclassifiable &amp; Spam.

Sender-related features: As senders were shown to play an important role in re-finding, we investigate a range of features describing a Tweet X  X  sender and the relationship between the participant and the sender. This group encom-passes a sender X  X  general account information ( SenderTweet-sPosted, SenderFollowerCount etc.) and several heuristics derived from the literature ( TweetsRT ) to determine whether the sender posts primarily about themselves ( X  X eformers X ) or about more broader topics ( X  X nformers X ) [34]. The user-sender-relation was captured by how many of a sender X  X  Tweets were received, clicked or specially interacted with by the participant ( TweetsPerSender, TweetsClickedPerSender, TweetsSIPerSender etc.).

Session features characterise a user X  X  behaviour dur-ing the session in which a Tweet was clicked for the first time. These include high-level session characteristics such as ( Duration, EventsTotal ), events per event categories (e.g. TimelineEvents, UserProfileEvents ), features with respect to Tweets ( TweetsHover, TweetsClick, TweetsBuffer ) infor-mation about Tweets on global level ( RTCount, FAVCount ) as well as information on a Tweet X  X  age and click-position ( TweetAge,TweetPosition ). Moreover a wide range of fea-tures related to mouse movement ( ScrollSummary, Down-ScrollTotal, UpScrollTotal, MouseMoveCount etc.) are part of this feature group. Finally, again with respect to the im-portance of senders, we integrate information regarding how many profiles are visited during the session ( ProfileVisits, TotalProfileTime ).

User features describe a participant X  X  overall Twitter be-haviour as recorded by the extension e.g. number of sessions in total, number of sessions per day ( SessionCount, Ses-sionsPerUserPerDay etc.) and account information ( User-TweetsPosted, UserFollowerCount etc.).

Some of the described features cost more to obtain than others. For example, Tweet features are freely available, given a reference to the clicked Tweet. Session-features can be recorded during regular Twitter use and not stored, if no Tweet was clicked. Finally, long term information about a user X  X  overall behaviour (user feature group) and her re-lation to other senders (user-sender-relation feature group) complete the picture, but are expensive in that they involve monitoring user behaviour over time and storing this in some way. Table 5 shows the results of the prediction experiments. The performance of all models is generally very good with only small gains in F1 and accuracy over the baseline model based only on (cheap to obtain) Tweet-features. The best model is a complicated model consisting of 115 features from three feature groups (Tweet + User-Sender-Relation + Ses-sion) and in practice would require long term observation.
To understand which features contribute most to model accuracy and whether it is possible to reduce the feature https://github.com/trinker/sentimentr https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/koRpus/ Table 4: Features used in the prediction task classi-fied by feature group. Features tagged with  X  have absolute and relative values. Features tagged with * have average and max values. space, we applied a cross validation function 8 for feature se-lection, which assesses prediction performance of different models by reducing the number of predictors in a stepwise
We used the rfcv function from the R package randomForest (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/) Figure 6: Accuracy vs #predictors. 3 top features obtain a similar performance to 80 or more.
 Table 5: Prediction performance for models with different feature groups sorted by F1. manner. Figure 6 shows that with the three features con-tributing most to model accuracy a random forest model can achieve a similar result as it would with 80 features or more. These features are: SessionCount , SessionsPerUserPerDay and TweetsClickedPerSender . All three are related to long-term behaviour and are costly to acquire. These features underline, however, that frequent Twitter users do seem to use Twitter as an information silo.

As we want models that work well for all users and don X  X  base predictions largely on detecting active users, we also tested variants which only utilise easily obtainable features and do not model long-term user behaviour at all. Remov-ing such behavioural features from the process still results in a model with many features (97), but achieves a high performance overall ( Tweet + Session F1: 0,79, Acc: 0,78).
Figure 7 shows the importance of the top 25 features in the Tweet + Session model as determined by the decrease in accuracy if the feature is dropped. The plot shows a dominance of variables from session group. However, two features from the Tweet-feature group (if a Tweet was part of a conversation ( POC ) and/or specially interacted with) are both good predictors for future clicks.
When summarising our findings it is important to con-cede that we only had access to a small sample of Twitter users and moreover only to interactions with the Twitter website via Chrome. A large proportion of Twitter usage is mobile/app-based 9 and these interactions were missing in our analyses. Nevertheless, in a way this makes our findings even more striking:
According to Twitter 80% of active users access via a mo-bile device (https://about.twitter.com/company).
 Figure 7: Top 25 features according to their mean decrease in accuracy of the model using only Tweet and session features. Each feature is colour-coded to show which feature group it belongs to. (i) Using a conservative proxy and missing cross-device interactions we can be certain we are under-estimating the frequency of re-finding, yet our results still indicate it is prevalent and the personal life-cycle of Tweets is longer than one might expect. Moreover, the data reveal that many older Tweets were interacted with, showing that Tweets can still be of value even after years have passed. (ii) Although participants were able to predict some short-term re-finding and bookmark these Tweets, hardly any of the longer-term re-accesses were RT X  X  or FAV X  X . This sug-gests that it is only later -induced by a then current informa-tion need -that the user becomes aware of the Tweet X  X  value (post-valued recall). This phenomenon has been observed in other PIM contexts [30, 49]. Even when participants did correctly predict a Tweet X  X  future utility and bookmark it, they tended not to use the bookmark to re-access. Forget-ting about bookmarks due to an  X  X ut of sight, out of mind X  problem has also been reported in the PIM literature [26]. (iii) Search is not used as IR-researchers might hope. Rather than searching for content directly ( teleporting ), par-ticipants first narrowed the space by searching for a person, then scrolled to re-access. This was one of two orienteer-ing strategies revealed and is most similar to the behaviour seen in email search [14]. The second orienteering strategy was link-based and reminiscent of the spatial navigation of-ten preferred when re-finding computer files [1]. The lack of teleporting strategies supports Teevan and colleagues X  deci-sion not to classify repeated queries as re-finding behaviour. (iv) We showed that future re-accesses can be predicted with reasonable accuracy. Different kinds of features are helpful, including long-term behavioural clues, which are costly to attain. Good performance can be attained, how-ever, using only predictors derived from Tweet content and meta-data. (v) Many of our analyses underline the importance of peo-ple in re-finding on Twitter: Re-finding sessions have more user profile requests, re-finding Tweets via the sender X  X  pro-file page is the most common strategy for Tweets older than a day and some of the most powerful predictive features for future re-access describe the relationship between the par-ticipant and the sender. Predictive models may offer utility in several ways as we outline below.
We have shown that some Tweets can offer relevance for longer than the period in which they are visible on the user X  X  timeline. Although Twitter is already taking steps to avoid the decaying visibility of Tweets by giving a recap of top Tweets via the  X  X hile you were away... X  feature 10 , the plat-form could do more to further help users return to relevant, older Tweets. We propose design implications for the two orienteering strategies observed in our study, but first make suggestions with respect to teleporting behaviour, which was not observed but is known from re-finding studies in other domains.

Support for teleporting: Although teleporting would be a more direct strategy to re-access Tweets, it is perhaps unsurprising that it wasn X  X  used. Twitter provides no obvi-ous means to apply search queries only to Tweets, which have appeared in the user X  X  own timeline. The one ex-ception being CTRL+F in the browser over the currently loaded Tweets. Twitter search queries can be restricted to return only Tweets posted by a specified user with the @-syntax, but we did not observe this in our data. It could be that users are unaware of the function. The auto-complete function also biases behaviour by immediately suggesting a user-profile page. Based on what we have learned, we be-lieve users would benefit from making the @-operator more prominent and allowing additional query terms to make the feature more usable for immediate re-finding.

There is also scope for improving the Twitter search algo-rithm directly to support re-finding. The features identified as effective in the prediction task, may also offer utility in a  X  X earning to rank X  approach to search. Similar to recent approaches for email search a decay function combined with behavioural features might lead to enhanced performance [8]. Our data could be used to run experiments similar to those in [8].

Support for orienteering: Support for re-finding via orienteering could be implemented via various different SUI features that support history mechanisms and help users return to previously viewed Tweets. One helpful change might be to subtly alter the colour of Tweets predicted to have future utility. This would make them easier to identify during the scrolling behaviour we identified as being typi-cal of re-finding sessions. This change could be applied on home timelines and on the profile pages of other users. An-other approach would be to allow such Tweets to re-appear amongst new Tweets. This idea has been shown to be effec-tive for web-page re-finding [43] and Facebook has started to do something similar with  X  X emories X , but several user stud-ies would be required to determine how many older Tweets to show, how to show them etc., as well as determine user tolerance for such an approach.
Analysing log data has proven very fruitful for IR research in recent years. We have used this technique to learn about information re-access and re-finding on Twitter. We have shed light on several aspects, demonstrating that re-finding https://blog.twitter.com/2015/while-you-were-away-0 is pervasive. That is, contrary to Jack Dorsey X  X  comments, people do  X  X o back in time X  and Tweets do sometimes prove useful for longer than they are typically visible in the ser-vice. We have investigated re-finding strategies applied and in doing so highlighted limitations of bookmarking strate-gies, both in terms of the accuracy in choosing which Tweets to bookmark and re-using them when they exist. A later step showed that automatic algorithms might be more ef-fective at predicting future utility. Based on our findings we made a number of design suggestions. In future work we hope to implement and evaluate some of the features we suggested. Nevertheless a deeper understanding of specific aspects would also be useful. For example we know from our analyses that people are important, but we don X  X  know which people are important nor why. Future studies might want to investigate what makes a person salient. Our next step, however, will be to think about how to perform al-gorithmic experiments similar to those described in [8] as mentioned above. [1] D. Barreau and B. A.
