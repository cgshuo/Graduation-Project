 People have their behavioral patterns, through which they determine how to seek and use information. People also exhibit established mobility pattern in their everyday lives. Meanwhile, the modern technologies such as smartphones, wearable devices, and eye trackers have allowed researchers to collect personal, contextual, and cognitive information of users, and create behavioral models from different per-spectives. Considering the analogy between information ex-ploration and geographical exploration, I want to identify the interconnections between these behaviors and predict individuals X  search behavior using personal and contextual signals. The proposal uses a mixed-method approach that involves a four-week field study, a game study, and a lab study, collecting data from 40 participants through mobile device, eye tracker, online logs, and weekly diary. Information seeking behavior; geographical exploration; ex-ploratory behavior
People develop their ways of information seeking over the life span regarding searching information in their everyday lives [3] and this behavior has been considered as an evolu-tionary instinct of individual [4]. Meanwhile, people show well-established mobility pattern in their daily life such as returners and explorers [1]. In this sense, interconnections between human information seeking behavior and foraging have been questioned. For example, Information Foraging theory [2] articulates that  X  X nformation foragers use per-ceptual and cognitive mechanisms that carry over from the evolution of food-foraging adaptations X .

Purpose of this work is to investigate and find hypothet-ical interconnections between geographical exploration and information seeking, with the following research questions: (RQ1) To what extent, if any, do offline/physical explo-ration behavior relates to information seeking behavior? ; and (RQ2) What aspects of offline/physical exploration can be used to explain and predict information seeking behavior?
The dissertation work consists of three studies: field study, game study, and lab study. The field study will capture par-ticipants X  physical exploration in everyday life and under-stand their information exploration both offline and online, installing an app on their phone and a Web browser plug-in on the computer. Along with the traces captured by GPS, participants X  intention and context will be collected through weekly diary during the four weeks. Regarding offline infor-mation exploration, participants are doing a treasure-hunt task that requires moving around in a physical space, look-ing for clues and answers to complete the given task. Online exploratory behavior will be examined through searching/ browsing histories during assigned search task(s).
The game study is designed to monitor and compare peo-ple X  X  information seeking behavior, bridging the possible gaps in findings from everyday life and controlled environment. Participants are playing a game that requires finding in-formation and clues in a limited space, such as an  X  X scape room X  game. The main reason for the study is to under-stand people X  X  cognitive process during information seeking in physical space, so we employ mobile eye tracker to observe their eye gaze during the game.

In the lab study, participants will be involved (1) an ex-ploratory search [5] task, asking the participant to collect as much information as possible to write a report, and (2) problem-solving task that requires more than simple query-ing to find answers to given puzzles.
