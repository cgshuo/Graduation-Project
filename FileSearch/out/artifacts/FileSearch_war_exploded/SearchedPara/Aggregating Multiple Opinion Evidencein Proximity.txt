 Blog post opinion retrieval is the problem of ranking blog posts according to the likelihood that the post is relevant to the query and that the author was expressing an opinion about the topic (of the query). A recent study has proposed a method for finding the opinion density at query term posi-tions in a document which uses the proximity of query term and opinion term as an indicator of their relatedness. The maximum opinion density between different query positions was used as an opinion score of the whole document. In this paper we investigate the effect of exploiting multiple opin-ion evidence of a document. We propose using the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator in order to combine the opinion score of different query positions for a final score of a document, in the proximity-based opinion retrieval system.

Blog post opinion retrieval is the problem of finding blog posts that express opinion about a given query topic. This problem was introduced in the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 2006 blog track and continued to 2008 [3]. The main challenge in blog post opinion retrieval is assigning query-related opinion scores to documents. A basic method is to use the average opinion weights of terms in a document as an opinion score of the document. This method assumes that all opinion terms in a document are referring to the query topic while does not consider the fact that a docu-ment can be relevant to many different topics but express opinion about topics other than the query. A recent study [1] proposed a proximity-based method for scoring documents based on the relevant opinion expressions in them. The proximity-based method, estimates the opinion density at every position of a document. Then aggregates the opinion density at different query term positions to assign an opin-ion score to the document. Average and Maximum were em-ployed in [1] to aggregate the opinion density at query term positions. While Maximum improved the opinion retrieval performance over the baselines, Average failed to achieve any improvement.

Although the maximum opinion density at query positions is the strongest opinion evidence, we believe that adding the opinion density of more query positions should not degrade the performance and can lead to great improvement in some cases. In this paper we investigate the effect of using the opinion density of more query term positions (as opposed to just the maximum value) in the proximity-based method. We show that better aggregation of these opinion evidence can improve the effectiveness of the system.
Proximity-based method, uses the distance of an opinion term to the query term as a measure of their relatedness. It considers a proximity-based density kernel centered at each opinion term which favors the nearby positions. The kernel is weighed by the opinion probability of the opinion term. The opinion density at every position of the document is the accumulated opinion probability from different opinion terms to that position. Thus the probability of opinion at position i in the document is estimated as: where, p ( o | t ) is the probability that term t is used to express an opinion (can be based on an opinion lexicon) and p ( j | i, d ) is the probability that term at position j is referring to the term at position i and is estimated using density kernel k as follows: here k ( j, i ), is the kernel function which determines the weight of propagated opinion from t j to t i .

The overall relevant opinion probability score, p ( o | d, q ) can be calculated by aggregating opinion evidence at differ-ent query positions. In the original paper Max and Average has been applied. This aggregation step is the focus of this paper and will be discussed in the next section.
In this paper we explore and compare different possibil-ities of aggregating the opinion evidence at different query positions in a document. As our baseline we use the Max which has been used in the previous work: The drawback of the Max method is that it relies only on the highest opinion evidence of every document and misses other available evidence that might be useful.

As a more general aggregation method which takes into account more opinion evidence, we use ordered weighted av-eraging (OWA) operator, which was introduced by Yager [4]. OWA provides a parametrized class of mean type ag-gregation operators, that can generate OR operator ( M ax ), AN D operator ( M in ) and any other aggregation operator between them like M ean . An OWA operator of dimension K is a mapping F : R K  X  R that has an associated weight-ing vector W , such that and where here a ind ( i ) is the i th largest element in the collection a OWA operators have different behaviours based on the weight-ing vector associated with them. Yager introduced two mea-sure for characterizing OWA operator [4]. The first one is called orness which characterizes the degree to which the operator behaves like an OR operator ( M ax ). The second measure is dispersion which measures the degree to which OWA operator takes into account all available information in the aggregation. To determine the weighting vector, we used the method proposed by O X  X agan[2]. He defines the problem as a constrained non-linear optimization problem. A predefined value of orness is the constraint for this prob-lem and dispersion is its objective function to be maximized. It is worth noting that based on the weighting vector, we can produce different aggregation methods including the simple methods like Max. For example if we want to combine five and average of the values respectively (the orness value is 1, 0 and 0.5 respectively). In our opinion retrieval system, we consider the K query positions with highest opinion density as the operands of the OWA operator. The value of K and the degree of orness are the parameters of the model.
In order to compare the results with the proximity-based method, we followed the proposed setting and parameters in [1]. The extra parameters of our model are the value of K and the degree of orness . We tried K values of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 and also orness values between 0 and 1 with step size 0.1 over the training set of topics. We chose the parameters that maximize the MAP. Table 1 presents the results on the Table 1: Opinion retrieval performance on TREC 2008 topics over top 4 standard TREC baselines us-ing different aggregation methods.

From the table, we can compare the effect of using Maximum (proxMax) or OWA operator over multiple query positions (proxTopK) in the proximity-based opinion retrieval framework. It can be seen that the proposed method is consistently effective across all TREC baselines.
In this paper, we investigated the effect of exploiting more opinion evidence compared to the maximum opinionated point in the proximity-based opinion retrieval method. OWA operator was used as an aggregator in our system. Experi-mental results over Blog06 collection showed the advantage of using multiple opinion query positions in comparing the opinion score of documents. In future, we plan to investi-gate the effect of adding other references to the query such as pronouns and use the opinion evidence in those positions.
