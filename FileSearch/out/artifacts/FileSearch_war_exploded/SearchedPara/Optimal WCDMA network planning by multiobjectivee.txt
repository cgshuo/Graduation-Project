 Fangqing Gu  X  Hai-lin Liu  X  Yiu-Ming Cheung  X  Shengli Xie Abstract The wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) network planning prob-lem requires to determine the location and the configuration parameters of the base stations (BSs) so as to maximize the capacity and minimize the installation cost. This problem can be formulated as a complex set covering problem. Compared to the classical set covering problems, the coverage area of each BS is unknown in advance. This makes that the selection of each BS location and configuration parameters is determined by the location and con-figuration parameters of the neighbor BSs. Accordingly, we will conduct a competition and cooperation model based on the re-covered area of the BSs to measure the relationship of the BSs. Then, an efficient genetic operation based on this model is proposed to generate new-quality solutions. Further, four BS configuration parameters, i.e., the antenna height, antenna tilt, sector orientation and pilot signal power, are taken into account as well. Since there are too many combination levels of the configuration parameters, an encoding method based on orthogonal design is presented to reduce the search space. Subsequently, we merge the proposed encoding method and genetic operation into the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm-based decomposition (MOEA/D-M2M) to solve the WCDMA network planning problem. Simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed encoding and genetic operation in comparison with the existing counterpart.
 Keywords Set covering problem  X  Wireless network planning  X  Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm  X  Orthogonal design 1 Introduction Due to the increasing demand for mobile radio services, wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) network planning has been becoming one of the most important research fields. The WCDMA network planning requires to select a subset of candidate sites (CSs) to (TPs) so as to maximize the capacity and minimize the installation cost. The WCDMA system is characterized by self-interference and  X  X reathing effect X  [ 27 ]. The greater the number of process, the relationship between coverage, capacity and interference should be fully taken into account.

In the past few years, a number of models have been proposed for wireless network and tabu search has been proposed to WCDMA network planning in [ 2 , 44 ], in which it plans the BSs location considering the signal quality constraints in both uplink and downlink. Furthermore, Yang et al. [ 45 ] have conducted programming model by taking into account soft handover and the fast transmission power control. Also, Amaldi et al. [ 3 ] have proposed a more comprehensive mathematical programming model for WCDMA network planning, in which it considers not only the BSs location, but also the BSs configuration parameters (i.e., Antenna height, Antenna tilt and Sector orientation). In addition, some multiobjective optimization models have been proposed to wireless network design in [ 32 , 39 , 46 ]. They proposed a multiobjective optimization model for resource assignment in wireless network. Also we proposed a multiobjective optimization model with iterative power control scheme in [ 24 , 36 ]. It can enhance the computational efficiency without degrading the performance evidently. We will concentrate on this model in this paper.

In the literature, a number of algorithms have been proposed to deal with the network planning problems. Some robust optimization algorithms in wireless network design have as a 0-1 programming problem and solved by cutting planes method [ 14 ]. The numerical stability is also the critical challenge to the wireless network planning model. Recently, mathematical formulation purely based on binary user-transmitter assignment variables was presented in [ 18 , 26 ], and a formulation using combinatorial benders X  cuts was presented in [ 42 ]. The mixed integer linear programming is used for planning the cost-efficient radio networks under network quality constraints in [ 21 ], in which the set covering method is used to obtain lower bounds on the number of BSs that need to serve a specific area, and an automatic two-phase network planning approach based on successively solving instances of the model has been presented. The tabu search algorithm described in [ 1 , 35 ] was utilized to solve the WCDMA planning models in [ 2 , 3 ]. A genetic algorithm optimization method in solving the network planning problem by using evolutionary algorithms have been done in [ 24 , 51 ]. In these works, it has shown that evolutionary algorithms are a promising and powerful tool for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems in their applica-tions.
The model in [ 36 ] formulates the WCDMA network planning problem as a complex set covering problem. In some literatures, the evolutionary algorithms have been utilized to solve lem as a  X  X lack X  box. It may force the evolutionary approach into unnecessary search and destructive mating. Also, the elements of the decision variable are not mutually independent in WCDMA network planning problem. That is, the best state for one BS in the WCDMA network planning models is determined by the state of the neighbor BSs. As far as we know, there are few articles taking into account the relationship among the elements of the decision variable [ 16 ]. Hence, we will first conduct a competition and cooperation model among BSs based on the re-covered area between the BSs. The competition and cooperation relationship Then, a specific and efficient genetic operation based on competition and cooperation model is in advance because of the  X  X reathing effect X  in WCDMA network, we can estimate the cov-erage area of each BS by the past populations. Moreover, four BS configuration parameters, i.e., Antenna height, Antenna tilt, Sector orientation and Pilot power, are taken into account in the model. Subsequently, an encoding method based on the combination levels of configu-ration parameters is proposed. Since there are too many combination levels of configuration parameters, it requires to sample a small, but representative subset of combination levels. automotive industry, marketing and other fields. The critical advantage of orthogonal design is that it allows the researcher to find a better combination level with fewer experiments. It is therefore utilized to decrease the combination levels of BS configuration parameters. In implementation, we shall merge the genetic operation and the specific encoding method into the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm-based decomposition (MOEA/D-M2M) [ 37 ] for solving WCDMA network planning problem. MOEA/D-M2M divides the multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) into a number of simple subproblems and then optimizes each subproblem in a collaborative way. Experiments have shown the efficacy of the proposed encoding and genetic operators in comparison with the existing counterpart. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are four-fold: 1) A novel coding method-based combination of the BSs configuration parameters is pro-2) A competition and cooperation model is conducted on the population, which can be used 3) A problem-specific crossover and mutation operators based on competition and cooper-4) We successfully specialize the MOEA/D-M2M approach to complex combination opti-
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 gives the overview of the mathematical model for WCDMA network planning problem. In Sect. 3 , we propose specific encoding and genetic operators for the WCDMA network planning problem. We merge the genetic operation and the specific encoding method into MOEA/D-M2M in Sect. 4 .We show the performance of the proposed encoding and genetic operators in comparison with the existing one in Sect. 5 . Finally, we draw a conclusion in Sect. 6 . 2 Overview of the model for WCDMA network planning 2.1 Assumptions and notations This section willsummarize the WCDMA network planning modelproposed in [ 36 ]. Suppose there are n CSs and only one BS can be installed in each CS at most. For each BS j  X  J ={ 1 , 2 ,..., n } , four configuration parameters, i.e., Antenna height, Antenna tilt, Sector orientation and Pilot power, are considered in this paper. Then, there are l combination levels of configuration parameter, and the set of all the combination levels is denoted as K ={ 1 , 2 , ..., l } . Meanwhile, a set of m TPs is also given. The asymmetrical traffic demand in the uplink and downlink is considered in this paper. The traffic demand of TP i  X  I = { 1 , 2 ,..., m } is represented by u u traffic demand of TP i is u i = u u i + u d i .

We assume that all the BSs are equipped with three identical sectors. The set of TPs, which are within the no-load coverage area of the sector  X  of BS j with the combination level k of TP i is corresponding to an active set J i , i  X  I which is composed with BSs whose no-load [ 36 ].

The propagation gain of the radio channels between CSs and TPs can be estimated by using prediction tools or obtained by actual measurements. Let G =[ g ijk ] mnl be the propagation gain tensor, where 0 &lt; g ijk &lt; 1 is the propagation gain between TP i and CS j with COST-231 Hata model [ 25 ] and vertical radiation diagram [ 9 ] in this paper. The COST-231 Hata model gives the attenuation due to signal propagation as a function of the distance between transmitter and receiver, the transmission frequency, and the base and mobile stations and the radial deviation from the signal main axis.

To describe the programming model, a binary variable matrix X =[ x jk ] n  X  l denotes the state of each CS, where x jk  X  X  0 , 1 } , j  X  J , k  X  K , satisfies CS j ; otherwise, x j = 0.

Meanwhile, a binary variable matrix S =[ s ij ] m  X  n denotes the state of each connection. s ij = 1 if and only if the connection between TP i and BS j satisfies the signal quality requirements in both uplink and downlink directions. That is i  X  I , j  X  J . The rest notations of the model are given in Table 1 . 2.2 The multiobjective optimization model for WCDMA network planning Considering the installation cost C cos and system capacity T cap , we formulate the WCDMA network planning as a MOP as follows: subject to the following constraints: where
Inthismodel,theconstraint( 3 )ensuresthateachTP i canbeassignedtooneBSatmostand parameter to be installed in CS j . Equation ( 5 ) makes that a TP i can be assigned to CS j onlyifaBShasbeeninstalledinCS j . The Quality of Service (QoS) of the network in the ensure the power emitted by the mobile stations, and base stations do not exceed the upper bounds. Finally, we consider the rate of coverage as constraint ( 11 ).

This model is a complex constraints nonlinear combination optimization problem. If X is determined, we can use the iterative power control scheme [ 36 ] to obtain the values of the determine the state of each connection. That is, the state of the connection s ij just depends the state of the connection s ij . Therefore, the model can be formulated as follows: 3 The specific encoding scheme and genetic operation 3.1 Encoding and decoding schemes based on orthogonal design For each BS, we consider four configuration parameters as follows: 1) Antenna height above the lower bound: h ; 2) Antenna tilt of each sector:  X  1 , X  2 , X  3 ; 3) Sector orientation:  X  ; 4) Pilot signal power:  X  p .
 The antenna height has an impact on the propagation gain tensor G . Since each BS has a specific lower bound of the antenna height according to the terrain variation, the antenna height is just a fine adjustment configuration. We consider the antenna height above the lower have an impact on the no-load coverage area I  X  jk and the TPs assignment.

In order to succinctly describe the configuration parameters of each BS, each combination level of configuration parameters is represented by a number. Subsequently, we can use a BSs configuration parameters. However, we can find that there are 6 6 = 46 , 656 combination levels of configuration parameters for each BS. The search space of configuration parameters combinations of the model is 46 , 656 n . As a result, it will be quite time consuming to find the best combination level of configuration parameters. Therefore, it is desirable to sample a used in many fields can do it.

To design an orthogonal array (OA), we denote OA as L R ( Q C ) ,where Q is the number of the levels and R = Q  X  is the number of the rows of the OA, where  X  is a positive integer fulfilling C = Q  X   X  1 Q  X  1  X   X  to minimize R = Q  X  ,where C is the number of the columns of the OA and  X  is the number of the factors (configuration parameters). In our research, Q = 6and  X  = 6, then we have  X  = 2, R = Q  X  = 36 and C = 7. In this study, we the last C  X   X  = 1 columns to get OA L 36 ( 6 6 ) .FromOA L 36 ( 6 6 ) , we know that there are only 36 combination levels for each BS. That is, the number of combination levels of configuration parameters is l = 36. It significantly decreases the search space of the model. y = l expresses that a BS is installed in CS j with configuration combination level l .That is, x jl = 1. For example, y 2 = 10 implies that a BS is installed in CS 2 with configuration combination level 10. The tenth row of the orthogonal array L 36 ( 6 6 ) is(2,4,5,6,1,2). Then, the information of the configuration parameters of BS 2 is available and it implies h = 1 , X  1 = 9 , X  2 = 12 , X  3 = 15 , X  = 0and  X  P = 1 . 2. Moreover, if there is no BS installed in CS j ,then y j = 0. Therefore, the problem ( 12 ) can be converted into the following problem in the solution y , i.e., the number of the nonzero elements of y .
 we obtain the configuration parameters of each BS according to the orthogonal array. The state matrix S l of the connections can be determined by the iterative power control method [ 36 ]. Then, we can obtain the installation cost and system capacity by Eqs. ( 1 )and( 2 )for the solution. 3.2 A competition and cooperation model between BSs In general, typical evolutionary algorithms suppose that the elements of the decision vari-able are independent. That is, these algorithms do not consider the relationship between the elements of the decision variable. However, the states of the BSs are not independent, but correlated with each other in WCDMA network planning problem. As described in Fig. 1 , between two BSs is too big, as described in Fig. 1 by BSs 2 and 3, it not only increases the interference between BSs, but also decreases the coverage area of one BS. Obviously, they each other with a small gap, as shown in Fig. 1 by BSs 1 and 4, some TPs cannot be covered. Further, if we add one BS between them, the re-covered area will be too big. They are also not suitable to be installed at the same time. In other words, we cannot assess in isolation how good the state of one BS is. That is, the best state of a BS is determined by the state of its neighbor BSs.

Toweighthetrade-offbetweeninstallationcostandcapacity,wesupposethattwoBSswith is defined according to the re-covered area between BSs to measure the relationship of the BSs. It features that the bigger r ij between BSs i and j is, the more suitable BSs i and j installed at the same time. That is, BSs i and j cooperate with each other. Conversely, they compete with each other.

However, the coverage area of the BSs is not available in advance because of the  X  X reathing effect X  in WCDMA network planning. Fortunately, we can estimate the re-covered area between BSs by the past populations. Note that each TP can be served by one BS at most in a solution. That is, there is no re-covered area between any two BSs. However, a TP can be served by multiple BSs in different solutions. Therefore, we can estimate the re-covered area the number of the TPs simultaneously covered by BS i and j , can be calculated as follows: matrix of the connections is S l , such that TP k can be covered by BS i in the solution. That is, Obviously, the TPs covered by BS i are the elements of  X  s i with the value 1. We can find area between BS i and j as the rate of the re-covered area relationship between BS i and j can be defined as where  X  is a parameter which is used to weigh the trade-off between installation cost and capacity. A larger value of r ij means that the system has greater capacity and needs larger amounts of installation cost. The re-covered rate of two neighbor BSs in cellular system is about 0.03, so that  X  = 0 . 03. r ij gets the maximum value as the rate of re-covered area is simultaneous installation of the pair of BS i and BS j is. 3.3 The crossover and mutation operators based on the competition and cooperation model Typical evolutionary operators, e.g., one-point crossover operator, multi-points crossover operator and random mutation operator which are widely used in combination evolutionary algorithms, tackle the problem as a  X  X lock X  box without considering the relationship between the elements of the decision variable. It may be invalid to generate good solutions. As shown in Fig. 2 , if we use the one-point crossover operator to generate the new solution, it may of the parents. Therefore, we propose a specific crossover and mutation operators based on relationship matrix R to generate the new solutions. 3.3.1 Crossover operator part in crossover, to produce one offspring y c . That is, we need to determine the number, the location and the combination level of configuration parameters of the installed BSs in the offspring. Specifically, our problem-specific crossover operator based on the relationship matrix R works as follows: It is set to that of one parent with equal probability. That is, active BSs in the parents y r 1 and y r 2 , respectively.

After that, we determine the location of the installed BSs in the offspring y c .Wemerge that J  X  J . Then, the BSs which are installed in the offspring y c are selected from J one by one. We describe the process of selecting in the following. At first, one BS is randomly selected from J as the first BS which is installed in the offspring. Then, suppose a set  X  J k with k installed BSs have been selected from J ,the ( k + 1 ) th BS, which is well suited to J  X   X  J k by solving the following problem. This process is performed until | y c | BSs are selected from J .

Finally, the combination level of configuration parameters of the installed BSs of the offspring is given as follows: If the BS is installed in two parents, its combination level of configuration parameters is randomly inherited from one parent with equation probability. Otherwise, its configuration parameters are inherited from exclusive parent. In the following, we give an example to illustrate the crossover operator.
 CSs is shown in Fig. 1 and the relationship matrix R is given as Then, the offspring y c is generated as follows: 1) AccordingtoEq.( 15 ), we assume that the number of the installed BSs in the offspring 3) Since BSs 2 and 4 only appear in one parent, their combination levels of configuration Figure 1 shows that y c has the good performance. 3.3.2 Mutation operator Mutation operator maintains the diversity of the population by randomly modifying the genes of a chromosome. However, since this problem is very complex, we primely focus on the convergence rate of the algorithm. Accordingly, we propose a problem-specific mutation operator based on the relationship matrix R to speed up the convergence rate of the algorithm. This mutation operator is comprised of two basic mutation operations: location mutation and parameter mutation.

Location mutation operator based on relationship matrix R modifies the location of the BS and swapping BS. (a) Adding BS: As the name suggests, we select one CS from J to install a new BS. Similar (b) Deleting BS: Deleting BS mutation means that the installed BS with minimum relation-(c) Swapping BS: Swapping BS mutation means to add a new BS with maximum relationship Parameter mutation implies to change the combination level of configuration parameter at random. We randomly select one BS from the set of installed BSs, and then change its combination level of configuration parameter. As shown in Fig. 2 , BS 5 is randomly selected and then further randomly change its combination level of configuration parameter. The procedure of mutation operation is described in Algorithm 1 .
 Algorithm 1 : Mutation Operator From the algorithm, we see that the probabilities of performing the adding BS, deleting BS and swapping BS are all 0.25. There is one BS whose configuration parameters are changed at random. 4 MOEA/D-M2M for WCDMA network planning 4.1 Decomposition scheme In order to adapt the problem ( 13 ) to MOEA/D-M2M, we transform the problem ( 13 )into the following minimization MOP: After such transformation, the objective space and Pareto front (PF), i.e., the set of all the Pareto-optimal vectors, of problem ( 18 )arein R 2 + .
 We use the MOEA/D-M2M [ 37 ] to solve the MOP described above. It decomposes the MOP into a number of simple MOPs and solves them in a collaborative manner. K direction where K is the number of the subproblems. Then, the first quadrant R 2 + is divided into K subregions 1 ,..., K ,where k ( k = 1 ,..., K )is: for any j = 1 ,..., K ,where u , v j is the acute angle between u and v j .Inotherwords, u is in k if and only if v j has the smallest angle to u among all the K direction vectors. Based on this division, problem ( 18 ) can be transformed into K constrained multiobjective optimization subproblems, where the subproblem k is:
Typically, we can use any selection schemes in MOEA/D-M2M. The Tchebycheff approach [ 40 ] is used in this paper. It considers the following scalar optimization problem: where w = (w 1 ,w 2 ) is a weight vector. For each Pareto-optimal solution point x  X  ,there be a set of even spread weight vectors which are uniformly chosen from the unit circle in the first quadrant, where N is the population size. These weight vectors are assigned into the subproblems. The weight vector w i ( i = 1 , 2 ,..., N ) is assigned into the k th subproblems is the number of the weight vectors which are assigned to this subproblem. Subpopulation k ( k = 1 ,..., K ) is for subproblem k . 4.2 The procedure of the proposed algorithm in CS j ; otherwise, y j is set at a random integer number in { 1 , 2 ,..., l } . At each generation, MOEA/D-M2M maintains K subpopulations: P 1 ,..., P K . Then, MOEA/D-M2M works as described in Algorithm 2 .

In general, we can use any selection schemes to initial and update the subpopulation. In this paper, the Tchebycheff approach is used to set the subpopulation P 1 ,..., P K . It works as described in Algorithm 3 . Algorithm 2 : MOEA/D-M2M for WCDMA Network Planning Problem Algorithm 3 : Allocation of Individuals to Subpopulations 5 Experimental simulations 5.1 Single-point crossover and random mutation operation Inordertodemonstratetheperformanceoftheproposedevolutionaryoperation,wecompared it with the typical single-point crossover and random mutation operation which are widely used in combinatorial optimization evolutionary algorithm. 5.1.1 Single-point crossover operation We choose the single-point crossover to create the offsprings. Given two solutions, this crossover operator creates a random integer number u between 1 and N  X  1andswaps u ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 11 , 12 ) ,if u = 2, the children will be y c = ( 0 , 10 , 0 , 11 , 12 ) . 5.1.2 Random mutation operation Themutationoperatorisusedtoescapeapossiblelocaloptimumandfindanewneighborhood with a potentially more promising solution. For each solution y c generated by the crossover operation, our implementation alters each component by selecting a random number between 1and N .Ifthe h th component of y c is selected to be mutated, we have of the configuration parameters. 5.2 Compared algorithms In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed evolutionary operation, we com-pared the proposed evolutionary operation with the single-point crossover and random muta-tion on MOEA/D [ 50 ], NSGA-II [ 20 ], HypE [ 5 ] and MOEA/D-M2M [ 37 ]. We denoted the algorithms, i.e., MOEA/D-M2M, MOEA/D, HypE and NSGA-II, employing the pro-posedcrossoverandmutationoperatorsasM2M-M,MOEA/D-M,HypE-MandNSGA-II-M, respectively. The algorithms which employ the single-point crossover and random mutation operators were denoted as M2M-S, MOEA/D-S, HypE-S and NSGA-II-S. In the following, we give a brief description of MOEA/D, NSGA-II and HypE. 5.2.1 MOEA/D Zhangetal.proposedamultiobjectiveevolutionaryalgorithmbasedondecompositionin[ 50 ]. The algorithm decomposes the MOP into a number of subproblems by adopting Tchebycheff approach and then optimizes them in a collaborative way. The MOEA/D proposed in [ 50 ] is for unconstraint MOP. A modified MOEA/D is proposed for the constraint MOP in this i associated with w i can be defined as
Moreover, for each w i , a neighborhood is defined as a set of T closest weight vectors in { w 1 , w 2 ,..., w N } ,where T is the number of the neighbors. The neighborhood of subproblem i is composed of the subproblems with the weight vectors from the neighborhood of w i . conditions is true. (1) Solution y i is feasible and y j is not; (3) Solutions y i and y j are feasible and g i ( y i | w i )&lt; g i ( y j | w i ) .
Thepopulation P isinitializedasdescribedinMOEA/D-M2M.Foreachindividual y i  X  P associated with subproblem i , individual y is randomly selected from the neighborhood of y . Moreover, an evolutionary operation is applied on y i and y and obtained  X  y i . The update if  X  y i is better than y j corresponding to g j ( y | w j ) ; otherwise, y j remains in P . 5.2.2 NSGA-II NSGA-II, which is one of the most widely used multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, was at next generation is generated from P t in the following way: In NSGA-II, the fast nondominated sorting makes the algorithm converges to the Pareto-optimal set and the crowded distance estimation method makes the algorithm have a good spread of solutions in the obtained set of solutions. 5.2.3 HypE A fast hypervolume-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, called HypE, was proposed preservationscheme.Thehypervolumeindicatorisusedtomaintainthespreadoftheobtained solutions. In general, the hypervolume indicator can also improve the convergence of the algorithm to a certain extent. HypE is available for download at http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/ sop/download/supplementary/hype/ . 5.3 Instance generator We conducted these algorithms with different evolutionary operators on some synthetic but realistic instances. These instances were generated by the instance generator tool described was usually selected by service providers considering traffic intensity in the area. A square service area D  X  D was considered in each instance. As shown in Fig. 3 ,wedividedthe Further, we assume that the numbers of the test point with high-, medium-and low-traffic demand were m h , m m and m l , respectively, so that m h + m m + m l = m .

The traffic demand of each test point was given as follows: We first selected the TPs which were assigned with high-traffic demand. A weight  X  i which was initially set to 1 was associated with TP i , i = 1 , 2 ,..., m . TPs were iteratively picked up with a probability p weights of the neighboring TPs which were not selected increased by 1. Once all m h TPs with high-traffic demand had been selected, the m m TPs with medium-traffic demand and the m l TPs with low-traffic demand were selected with the same procedure.
The position of n CSs was also randomly selected in the set of crossing points of the regular grid. The procedure we adopted was similar to the previous one. That is, each grid point was assigned a weight that is equal to the sum of the traffic demand of the neighboring TPs. After each iteration, the weight of the selected point is set to zero.

We conducted the proposed algorithm on four instances with different size generated by the method described above, i.e., small size, medium size, large size and huge size. Also, we let u u i = 12 , 6 , 2 for the TPs with high-, medium-and low-traffic demand in uplink, and u d i = 7 , 3 , 1 for the TPs with high-, medium-and low-traffic demand in downlink, respectively. We supposed the lower bound of the antenna height of the BSs were the same and set at 35 in meter. The other parameters used to generate the instances are given in Table 2 . 5.4 Experiment setting and performance metrics All the algorithms were conducted on theses instances with the different sizes. The parameters of the algorithms were given as follows:  X  The population size was set at 100 for all instances in all algorithms;  X  The number of the subpopulations was set at 10 in M2M;  X  The weight vectors were also uniformly chosen from the unit circle in the first quadrant, and the number of the neighborhoods was set at 10 in MOEA/D;  X  Stopping criteria: All algorithms stopped after 20 generations for small instance, 60 gener-ations for medium instance, 100 generations for large instance, and 200 for huge instance. The H-value [ 52 ] was used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. In addition, since the PF of this MOP is discrete, there are the finite Pareto-optimal solutions in the problems. We can use the proportion of the global nondominated solutions obtained by an algorithm, denoted as P -value, in the all global nondominated solutions to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Global nondominated solution is defined as the solution which is not dominated by any solutions obtained by all the algorithms. 5.4.1 H-value any Pareto-optimal objective vectors. Let S be the obtained approximation to the PF in the is dominated by S and dominates y  X  . In our experiments, the reference point of each instance isgiveninTable 3 . The larger the H-metric is, the better the approximation is. 5.4.2 P-value P -value is the proportion of the global nondominated solutions obtained by an algorithm in all the global nondominated solutions. This performance metric evaluates not only the However,thisperformancemetricmaynotworkwellfortheMOPwithmanyorinfinitePareto optimal solutions because all the solutions obtained by the algorithm may be nondominated solutions. 5.5 Experimental results Table 3 presented the H-value of the final solutions obtained by the algorithms employing the proposed evolutionary operators, i.e., NSGA-II-M, HypE-M, MOEA/D-M and M2M-M for the instances, and Table 4 presented the H-value of the final solutions obtained by the algorithms employing the single-point crossover and random mutation operators, i.e., NSGA-II-S, HypE-S, MOEA/D-S and M2M-S for each instance. The best results obtained by the compared algorithms for the test instances were highlighted in bold text. Comparing Tables 3 and 4 , it can be seen that the results obtained by the algorithms with the proposed evolutionary operators are better than the algorithms with single-point crossover and random mutation operators for all instances. This implies that the crossover and mutation operator based on the competition and cooperation model can greatly improve the performance of the algorithms. In addition, we can find that, in terms of H-value, M2M-M and MOEA/D-M had a similar performance as shown in Table 3 , and M2M-M was better than MOEA/D-M in Table 4 . Further, HypE-M and NSGA-II-M had a similar performance in both Tables. Moreover, M2M-M are better than HypE-M and NSGA-II-M in both Tables. A plausible reason is that the M2M had not only a good search capability, but also a good spread of solutions owing to the decomposition scheme.

Table 5 presented the P-value of the final solutions obtained by the algorithms for each instance. This table indicates that the global nondominated solutions are all obtained by the algorithms employing the proposed evolutionary operators. Evidently, the proposed evolu-tionary operators can improve the performance of the algorithms.

Figure 4 shows the distribution of the final solutions obtained by the algorithms for each instance in the objective space. The left column is for the algorithms employing the proposed evolutionary and the right column is for the algorithms with the single-point and random mutationoperators.Itcanbeseenthatthefinalsolutionsobtainedbythealgorithmsemploying the proposed evolutionary operators are much better than the algorithms with single-point crossover and random mutation operators. It implies that the proposed evolutionary operators can improve the performance of the algorithm. Further, MOEA/D-M is slightly worse than the other three algorithms in terms of spread and diversity, the former outperforms the latter ones in terms of convergence in the left column for the medium, large and huge size instance. Moreover, we can find that M2M had not only a good spread final solutions, but also the rapid convergence and high precision for all instances.

Figure 5 plots the H-value versus the number of the generations in the algorithms for the instances. The left column is for M2M-M, MOEA/D-M, HypE-M and NSGA-II-M and the right column is for M2M-S, MOEA/D-S, HypE-S and NSGA-II-S. From this figure, we can see that, in terms of H-value, the solutions obtained by running the algorithms employing the proposed evolutionary operators with 3 generations are better than the final solutions obtained by running the algorithms utilizing the single-point crossover and random mutation evolutionary can also accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithms.

Figure 6 plots the distribution of the active BSs of the solution with the least active BSs and most covered traffic demands found by M2M-M for the instances. It can be seen that the distribution of the actives is reasonable from the practical viewpoint. 6Conclusion We have proposed a novel multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to solve the WCDMA network planning problem, in which a cooperation and competition model is conducted on the population. Then, an evolutionary operator based on the cooperation and competition model has been presented to generate new-quality solutions. Such evolutionary operator has taken into account the relationship of the elements of the decision variable. Evidently, this evolutionary operator can be extended to the conventional set covering problems. We have applied the evolutionary operator to MOEA/D-M2M, MOEA/D, HypE and NSGA-II, and compared it to the traditional single-point crossover and random mutation operators on some synthetic but realistic instances. The simulation results have shown the efficacy of the proposed evolutionary operators in comparison with the existing counterpart. In addition, we have successfully specialized the MOEA/D-M2M to the complex combinatorial optimization problems. The simulation results have shown that MOEA/D-M2M features good spread solutions, rapid convergence and high precision.
