 We present study navigator , an algorithmically-generated aid for enhancing the experience of studying from electronic textbooks. The study navigator for a section of the book consists of helpful concept references for understanding this section. Each concept reference is a pair consisting of a concept phrase explained else-where and the link to the section in which it has been explained. We propose a novel reader model for textbooks and an algorithm for generating the study navigator based on this model. We also present the results of an extensive user study that demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed system across textbooks on different sub-jects from different grades.
 H.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Algorithms, Experimentation, Human Factors Data Mining, Education, Electronic Textbooks, Study Navigator, Reader Model
With the emergence of abundant online content, cloud comput-ing, and electronic reading devices, the multi-billion dollar text-book industry is poised for transformative changes. Notwithstand-ing understandable misgivings (e.g. Gutenberg Elegies [7]), text-books cannot escape what Walter Ong calls  X  X he technologizing of the word X  [18]. Already, there are initiatives such as  X  X o child left offline X  that are centered around the availability of electronic text-books for achieving the goal of  X  X ny time, any place, any pace X  learning [2]. These trends are not limited to USA or other de-veloped nations. For example, Government of India is said to be developing a low cost tablet, Aakash, pre-loaded with educational content for distributing to millions of students [3].

We believe electronic textbooks provide huge opportunity to in-vent new tools and techniques to facilitate effective use of this medium. Some of the new functionalities that can be enabled in future textbooks include: New navigations . The book can infer navigational aids beyond ta-ble of contents, back-of-the-book index, and simple hyperlinks. Adaptability . The book can be personalized to suit the student X  X  knowledge of the subject material as well as learning styles. The presentation can be dynamically modified to adapt to the require-ments of the student based on prior interaction with the book. Richer experiences . The book can be augmented with images, pic-ture galleries, videos, and live simulations to provide a better learn-ing experience.
 Continuous self-assessment . The book can offer personalized as-sessments and recourses in a non-invasive way.
 Collaborative learning . The book can propose interactions with other students, appropriate for the part of the book a student is studying. It can also suggest compatible study groups that can span different geographical regions.

This paper presents one particular study aid we have designed specifically for electronic books, called study navigator . The goal of the study navigator is to provide easy access to concepts ex-plained elsewhere in the book that are most relevant for understand-ing the present section. Refer to the pair consisting of a concept useful for understanding a section and the link to the section where it has been explained as a concept reference . The study navigator consists of significant concept references for every section in the book. It can be activated by a student while reading a particular section and shows the corresponding concept references. Only a small number of significant concept references are shown to avoid undue cognition burden on the reader.

Our main technical contribution is the algorithmic mining of the concept references in the context of a reader model we propose for textbooks. Our reader model is inspired by the random web surfer model and personalized PageRank computation. However, the ran-dom walk used in our model has significant differences, such as (1) the preference vector gets updated during certain types of transi-tions while it is fixed in personalized PageRank computation, and (2) return transition occurs with a large probability in our model unlike in PageRank computations [5]. We also present the results of an extensive user study showing that the judges found the refer-ences provided by the study navigator to be quite helpful. Authoring tools for adaptive navigation and presentation : A promi-nent system in this category is InterBook [8], a tool for creating an electronic book that can adapt to users with different backgr ounds, prior subject knowledge, and learning goals. The data required to enable this adaptation must be provided as input by the author. We aim to infer the concept references needed for building the study navigator by algorithmically mining the text of the book. Adaptive educational hypermedia systems : The goal of these sys-tems is to combine hypermedia systems with Intelligent Tutoring Systems to adapt web-based educational material to the needs of particular users. They aim to help educators manually setup person-alized courseware based on the cognitive style ( e.g. , AES-CS [24], EDUCE [15]) or learning style ( e.g. , KBS Hyperbook [13], IN-SPIRE [19]). They operate under the premise that the underlying information to enable this personalization is available to the per-son creating the courseware. We, on the other hand, aim to provide automated techniques.
 Exploratory hypermedia systems : We put various systems catego-rized as ASK systems ( e.g. , Trans-ASK [6] and ASKTool [11]) into this category. They aim to provide an interactive environment that mimicks conversing with an expert for its users to be able to find content of interest and/or ask follow-up questions to retrieve ad-ditional topics. In contrast, we look at the problem of identifying sections that are needed for understanding the current section. Text browser and search tools : SuperBook [20], ScentIndex [10], ScentHighlights [9], and Smart [22] are examples of such systems. In contrast to our system, these systems do not provide references to concepts/sections that are useful for understanding a given section. Back-of-the-book indices : While related, there are fundamental differences between a back-of-the-book index [17] and what we call concept references associated with each section of the book. In principle, one could do a sort on section numbers of a back-of-the-book index and thus find the important phrases present in each section. But it solves only half of the problem  X  if we know that a concept phrase  X  is important for understanding a given section, we can use this approach to know all the sections where  X  is possibly explained. But how do we know which  X  is critical for understand-ing the present section? In fact, it is quite likely that  X  might not even appear as a phrase in the present section. For the same rea-son, hyperlinking some phrases appearing in the current section is not sufficient. Another key difference is that back-of-the-book in-dex generation algorithms compute global significance of concept phrases at the book level without taking into account where in the book the reader currently is.
The study navigator system is designed to make it easy for a student to find concepts described elsewhere in the book that are most relevant to the material discussed in the present section. We refer to the pair consisting of a concept useful for understanding a section and the link to the section where it has been explained as a concept reference . For the purposes of this paper, we represent a concept as a phrase, and denote it as cphr . Our goal is to determine a few h cphr , section i pairs that are most relevant for understanding the current section.
Suppose that the set of cphrs contained in a section as well as the relationship between cphrs is available 1 . We then need to determine the concept references that are most significant for understanding
W hile multiple approaches are possible for computing cphrs and relationships between them [14], our implementation uses the ap-proach provided in [4] for this purpose. a given section s . For this purpose, we need a score denoting how significant is the description of a cphr c in a different section t for understanding section s . Given the significance scores of every cphr in every other section for understanding section s , we can order h cphr , section i pairs by their significance scores and include pointers to the top k h cphr , section i pairs in the study navigator for section s .

The significance score of a cphr in section t for understanding a different section s can be thought of in terms of how likely is the description of this cphr in section t to be referred when a reader is trying to understand section s . How do we formalize and quantify this likelihood? We surmise that while reading a book, a reader would refer to more significant cphrs more often.
 Reader Model : Consider a student who is reading a textbook start-ing from the first section. When she is reading a section i , she comes across the cphrs in the order c i 1 , c i 2 , c i 3 reader comes across a cphr c , with a large probability, the reader will be persistent in continuing to read the section. With a certain probability, she may not understand the cphr and hence may be forced to refer to another section to seek explanation.

Postulate that whenever the reader does not understand c , she refers to a section containing the same cphr c or a different cphr re-lated to c . More precisely, the reader picks a cphr c  X  from the set of cphrs related to c with equal probability, chooses an occurrence of and refers to the corresponding section i  X  to learn more about c  X  . It is possible that i  X  is a section earlier than i in the book or it is a later section. After reading about c  X  in i  X  , the reader has the following options: (a) return to the original section i with a large probability, and continue further reading, or (b) digress further to learn more about c  X  by referring to a section containing c  X  or a different cphr related to c  X  , that is, pick a cphr c  X  X  from the set of cphrs related to amongst all occurrences of c  X  X  with equal probability. In the latter case, the reader then returns to the original section i , or digresses further. Note that, while digressing, the reader can revisit a section i  X  ( e.g. , for reading about c  X  X  X  which is also explained in section i  X  and which is related to c  X  X  ). But the return from a digression is al-ways to the starting section i (irrespective of the number of hops digressed) as the reader is trying to understand section i and the purpose of the digression is to seek better explanation for c occur-ring in i . See Figure 1 for an illustration.
 Computing Significance Scores : Consider different students try-ing to understand section s . We obtain the significance score of a cphr c in section t for understanding section s by computing how often these students refer to the description of this cphr in section t when reading section s . More precisely, whenever a reader has difficulty understanding a cphr in section s and hence is forced to digress to other sections, we compute how likely is the reader to refer to cphr c in section t . We then aggregate these likelihoods over many readers and over all cphrs in section s . See Figure 2 for an illustration.

We next formalize the algorithmic intuition presented above, and precisely formulate the reader model and the computation of signif-icance scores.
Let S = { 1 , 2 , . . . , n } denote the set of sections in a given text-book. Let C denote the set of cphrs (concept phrases) in the book. For each cphr c  X  C , denote the set of cphrs related to it by R ( c ) . Note that R ( c ) includes c . Let  X  s ( c, t ) denote the significance score of cphr c in a different section t for understanding section s . Let k s denote the number of desired h cphr , section i concept ref-erences in the study navigator for section s . Table 1 summarizes key notations.
We formulate the reader model as a random walk over a concept graph G = ( V, E p  X  E d ) . Each node u = h i, c ij , j i  X  V is a h section, cphr , position i triplet corresponding to the occurrence of cphr c ij in section i and its sequential position j amongst the cphrs in the section. Denote the associated section i by  X  the associated cphr c ij by  X  c ( u ) . There are two types of directed edges in G . The set of persistence edges E p consists of directed edges corresponding to sequential reading of the book, that is, there is a directed edge from h i, c ij , j i to h i, c i ( j +1) last concept node in a section to the first concept node in the next section. The set of digression edges E d consists of directed edges corresponding to forced digression, that is, there is an edge from u associated with u ).

The random walk consists of three types of transitions: 1. Persistence transition: From any node u , follow the persis-2. Digression transition: From any node u , follow a digression 3. Return transition: From any node to which the reader has
The above walk requires keeping track of sequential position of the reader in the book because whenever the reader has digressed, she needs to return to the position from where the digression origi-nated. In other words, the return transition depends not only on the current state in the walk but also the state from which the reader started the digression. The Markov property can be achieved by creating |V| copies of the nodes (and digression edges) as follows. The modified graph consists of the set V of nodes, the set E persistence edges corresponding to sequential reading, and further, a copy of ( V, E d ) rooted at each node u  X  V . The digressions that originate from any node u are confined to the copy of V rooted at u and the return transitions point to u from all nodes in the copy rooted at u . By creating a separate copy of digression edges for each sequential position (node), we implicitly keep track of the state from which the reader started the digression and thus the re-turn transition can be determined based on just the current state.
Consider the random digression walk starting from an arbitrary node u (that is, the walk corresponding to the chain of digres-sions originating from u consisting of only digression and return transitions but no persistence transitions). In this walk, the return transitions always point to u a nd the digression transitions are de-termined based on the current state. Hence, this walk induces a Markov chain over the strongly connected component reachable from node u . This Markov chain is (a) finite (b) irreducible since the underlying graph consists of a single strongly connected com-ponent, and (c) aperiodic since the underlying graph is non-bipartite. Thus, the Markov chain satisfies the necessary conditions for ap-plying the fundamental theorem of Markov chains [16], leading to the claim below.

C LAIM 3.1. There is a unique stationary probability distribu-tion  X  ( u, . ) associated with the random digression walk starting from any node u in G .

By definition, the stationary probability  X  ( u, v ) denotes the prob-ability that the walk starting from node u is at node v in the steady state. In other words, this probability corresponds to the relative frequency with which the reader refers the cphr  X  c ( v ) correspond-ing to v when trying to understand the cphr corresponding to u and hence larger  X  ( u, v ) implies that the reader is more likely to refer to v . Thus  X  ( u, v ) is a measure of the relative significance of an occurrence of cphr  X  c ( v ) in section  X  i ( v ) corresponding to v for un-derstanding the cphr corresponding to u . Considering the random walks starting from each concept node in a given section s of the book, we can thus compute the significance of a single occurrence of cphr  X  c ( v ) in section  X  i ( v ) for understanding cphrs in section s . Our goal is to compute the significance of all occurrences of a cphr in a section. Hence we further aggregate the above score over all occurrences of cphr  X  c ( v ) in section  X  i ( v ) . In this manner, we also incorporate the frequency of the cphr in the section. Note that we chose not to include persistence transitions for significance score computation since sequential reading is the default reading behav-ior, and we want to take into account the reader X  X  deviation from this behavior in the form of forced digressions.

We thus define the significance score  X  s ( c, t ) of a cphr c in sec-tion t for understanding section s in terms of the combined station-ary probability associated with nodes corresponding to all occur-rences of c in t , summed over random walks starting from all con-cept nodes in section s . We remark that our definition of  X  takes into account the following desired factors: the frequency of c in t , the number of cphrs related to c and the likelihood that the description of c in t would be referred for understanding cphrs in section s in the book.

D EFINITION 3.2. Given the stationary probabilities  X  ( ., . ) as-sociated with the random digression walks, define the significance score of a cphr c in section t for understanding section s as
In the above definition, the inner summation is over all occur-rences of cphrs in section s (corresponding to the digressions by readers who are unable to understand different cphrs in section s ) and the outer summation is over all occurrences of cphr c in section t (corresponding to how often these readers refer to the description of c in section t ). Number of concept references : We note that the number of desired references for a section can be determined in multiple ways. It can either be a small fixed number across all sections, or be determined based on the distribution of the significance scores for each section. In the latter case, given a limit k max (say, 5) on the maximum num-ber of references to be shown and a desired coverage  X  (say, 75%), we can set k s to be the minimum of (i) k max and (ii) the number of top h cphr , section i pairs for section s needed to cover  X  fraction of the sum of significance scores over all h cphr , section i pairs for this section.
 Parameter Values : In our implementation of the reader model, there is effectively one parameter that determines the probabilities of the three types of transitions. When digression originates from a node, there are exactly two choices, to persist reading or to digress, and hence  X  +  X  = 1 . Similarly, for subsequent nodes in the digression, there are exactly two choices, to return back to starting node or to digress further, and hence  X  +  X  = 1 . Thus  X  =  X  = 1  X   X  . This relationship between  X  and  X  is in agreement with the following natural intuition: one X  X  tendency to read forward in a section is the same as the tendency to return to the starting point after a digression, since both these tendencies try to achieve the same goal of one X  X  disciplined reading and completion of the entire book.

We experimented with different choices of the digression factor, and confirmed that the results from our reader model are robust to these choices. We chose  X  = 0 . 3 in our implementation. This choice corresponds to the reader starting a digression 30% of the time and persisting to read sequentially 70% of the time.
The study navigator can be generalized to include only section references (that is, references at the granularity of a section) so that each section is treated as an atomic unit of reading. For this purpose, we compute the significance score  X   X  s ( t ) of section t for understanding section s and then modify our algorithm to return an ordered list of top k section references for section s , based on the significance scores.  X   X  s ( t ) can be computed either (1) by aggregating the significance scores at h cphr , section i granularity model to treat each section as an atomic unit of reading. For ex-ample, the reader can be modeled to read an entire section before referring to other sections for cphrs that she could not understand. Similarly, whenever she digresses to a different section, she reads the digressed section from beginning to end, and then determines whether to digress to another section or return to the starting sec-tion.
 Simplified Significance Score Computation : The significance score computation for section references can be approximated using the following simplified algorithm. For each cphr c in section s , deter-mine other sections that mention c (say, using the back-of-the-book index if present) and then obtain the significance score of section t for section s as the number of distinct cphrs that are present in both s and t . This algorithm tries to simulate a reader who uses the back-of-the-book index to determine other sections to refer to while reading a section. This algorithm uses only information local to a section and other sections that share common cphrs while the reader model based algorithm performs a global computation us-ing random walks. The former can be viewed as approximating the latter, analogous to how in-degree (a local measure) can be used to approximate PageRank (a global measure) [12].
We carried out extensive experiments to understand the perfor-mance characteristics of the study navigator system and present the results in this section. The goal of our evaluation is to determine whether users find the references provided by the study navigator system useful.
We used a corpus of Indian high school textbooks published by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). We selected this corpus because these books were readily available online. The corpus consists of books from grades IX X  X II, cover-ing four broad subjects: Sciences, Social Sciences, Commerce, and Mathematics. For the purpose of in-depth analysis, we use Grade XII Economics textbook. We also present results for two other books from very different subjects: Grade X Science and Grade XII History.
Given the unavailability of a standard benchmark, we used the following procedure to evaluate the usefulness of the references proposed by the study navigator. For a given section, we first deter-mined the top three sections referred by the study navigator. Ide-ally, we would have liked to compare them with those that an expert human judge (such as a teacher using the book or a student studying from the book) finds most useful after reading the entire book. In the absence of the availability of this subject population to us, we used the Turkers from the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform as judges. However, we could not recruit Turkers who were willing to read the entire book. We, therefore, changed the task to determine if the Turkers can differentiate the sections suggested by the study navigator from other sections. For this purpose, we obtained three arbitrary sections from the book and provided the original section along with these six sections to a judge, after scrambling the or-dering between the referred sections. The judge was asked to read the original section, followed by all the six referred sections. Then the judge was asked to select exactly three most useful amongst the referred sections. This exercise was carried out using multiple judges.

We employed Borda X  X  method to merge the votes of different judges. Borda X  X  method strives to achieve a consensus ranking and satisfies desirable properties such as reversal symmetry [21]. Each judge can be viewed as assigning one point each to three out of six referenced sections and zero point each to the remaining three. De-note the total number of points a section obtained from the judges as its vote score. Consider the set of three sections with the largest vote score. These are the sections voted as most relevant by the judges according to Borda X  X  method.

Out of these Borda winners, we determine the number of sec-tions that were also suggested by the study navigator and define the helpfulness index as the number of study navigator references in this set divided by three (size of the set). Thus, in the absence of ties, the helpfulness index for each section will be equal to one of the following four values: 1, 2 / 3 , 1 / 3 , and 0. A value of 1 means that the top three sections voted by the judges were the same as the top three study navigator section references and a value of 0 means that the judges considered the arbitrary sections as more relevant than the study navigator section references.

However, it may not be possible to uniquely determine the set of three sections with the highest vote because of ties. In this case, we compute the helpfulness index by taking the expectation over all possible choices of this set, as explained in the following ex-ample. Let i 1 , i 2 and i 3 be the study navigator section references with vote scores of 4, 3 and 3 respectively and r 1 , r 2 arbitrary section references with vote scores of 6, 3 and 2 respec-tively. The winner set always includes r 1 (section with the largest vote score) and i 1 (section with the second largest vote score). However, there are three possible candidates for the third section: i , i 3 or r 2 . Thus, possible choices are h r 1 , i 1 , i h r , i 1 , r 2 i , with corresponding helpfulness index of 2 / 3 , 2 / 3 and 1 / 3 respectively. Hence, the helpfulness index in expectation will be 2 / 3+2 / 3+1 / 3 3 = 5 / 9 . Thus, the helpfulness index for a sec-tion can be one of a small set of discrete values. In the results we present, in addition to the expected value, we also provide the two extreme possible values of the index, corresponding to the unfavor-able choice (where we favor the inclusion of an arbitrary section in the winner set over a navigator section) and the favorable choice (where we favor a navigator section over an arbitrary section).
Figure 3 shows the HIT (Human Intelligence Task) provided to the judges. In this example HIT, Sections 2.2, 4.3 and 5.2 are study navigator section references and Sections 1.1, 3.1 and 6.1 are arbi-trary sections. Notice that the sections have been randomly ordered.
Each HIT was judged by seven judges. There were 158 distinct judges who took part in the study. We specified that a judge spend a minimum of half an hour on a HIT. We required our judges to have performed at least 1000 HITs in the past with an approval rating of at least 96%. Such judges have a strong interest in retain-ing their high rating. The judges had at least High School degree. We followed best practices suggested in the literature in accepting HITs [1].

We also validated the quality of judgments along different di-mensions. We verified that the judgments did not exhibit position bias and judges were not unduly influenced by the (randomized) order in which the six sections are presented in each HIT. Simi-larly, we verified that the judges did not have a backward bias (that is, tendency to favor earlier sections in the book) or a forward bias (that is, tendency to favor later sections). See [5] for details.
The overall performance of the Study Navigator system for the three textbooks is shown in Figure 4. Each book is shown in the X-axis and the helpfulness index, averaged over all sections in the book, is shown in the Y-axis. The extreme values of the index are shown using an error bar. The results are very encouraging. The average helpfulness index for Grade XII Economics and Grade XII History books is 80% and 78% respectively, and this index is as high as 91% for Grade X Science book.
 We next show the performance broken down at the section level. Figure 5 gives the fraction of sections with certain helpfulness in-dex for the three books. For 71% of sections in Grade X Science book, the helpfulness index is 100%, that is, the judges considered all three study navigator section references as useful. For over 90% of sections, the helpfulness index exceeds 67%, that is, the judges considered at least two out of the three study navigator section ref-erences as useful. For 40% of sections in Grade XII Economics book and for 36% of sections in Grade XII History book, the help-fulness index is 100%. Furthermore, for 80% of sections in Grade XII Economics book and for 90% of sections in Grade XII His-tory book, the judges considered at least two out of the three study navigator section references as helpful.

Grade X Science book has a higher helpfulness index because chapters are relatively self-contained in this book. On the other hand, in Grade XII Economics and Grade XII History books, even an arbitrary section can be considered relevant to the original sec-tion since common concepts are discussed across many chapters.
We also performed in-depth analysis of the performance results by ourselves reading the books carefully. This analysis revealed that the cases where the judges preferred references other than those provided by the study navigator, it was mostly for sections that re-minded them of the material covered earlier, or described appli-cations of the material being discussed, or provided general tools ( e.g. , how to interpret a graph). See [5] for details.
The future of textbooks is electronic. Sven Birkerts thus opined about this brave new world [7]:  X  X hat the writer writes, how he writes and gets edited, printed and sold, and then read  X  all the old assumptions are under siege. X  However, the current technology is still quite nascent [23]. We anticipate a surge of innovations to make studying from electronic textbooks much more pleasant and productive. Electronic textbooks as a medium is fundamentally dif-ferent from printed textbooks, and hence has the potential to enable new kinds of functionalities.

We presented study navigator , one such novel functionality that can enhance the experience of studying from electronic textbooks. The goal of the study navigator is to help a student learn the mate-rial better and faster by providing easy access to concepts explained elsewhere in the book that are most relevant for understanding the present section.

The study navigator can be adapted to match a student X  X  infor-mation processing preference. In an extension of this work in [5], we consider two types of readers: curious and diligent . When read-ing a section, a curious student might be open to referring unread later sections that provide advanced information while a diligent student might prefer references only to earlier sections to refresh the material the student has already read. This extension, which we call the student-specific navigator , allows students to control the balance between sections that help refresh material already studied vs. sections that provide more advanced information by adjusting a curiosity-factor knob.

Though currently unavailable, rich data on reader X  X  actions can be obtained once electronic textbooks are widely deployed. In the future, we would like to investigate how reader X  X  actions can be incorporated to further enhance the study navigator. Another di-rection is to explore specializations of the study navigator for ad-ditional learning styles beyond the information processing orienta-tions of the reader. More generally, we are interested in designing tools that make use of the electronic format to imbue unique func-tionality in electronic textbooks along the lines described in the introduction to this paper.
