Event factuality results from the interaction between polarity and certainty. Here we reviewtheconnectionsofthesetwonotionswithotheronesinthestudyoflanguage.
Certainty. Theaxisofcertaintyisrelatedto epistemic modality ,acategorydealingwith thedegreeofcertaintyofsituationsintheworld.Epistemicmodalityhasbeenstudied ent traditions converge in analyzing modality as a subjective component of discourse (e.g., Lyons 1977; Chafe 1986; Palmer 1986; Kiefer 1987), a view that is adopted in the presentanalysis. 4 Traditionally,thestudyofepistemicmodalityinlinguisticshasbeen confined to modal auxiliaries (e.g., Palmer 1986), but more recently a wider view has beenadoptedwhichincludesotherpartsofspeechaswell,suchasepistemicadverbs, adjectives,nouns,andlexicalverbs(e.g.,Rizomilioti2006).
 evidentiality , concerned with the way in which information about situations in the world is acquired, such as directly experienced, witnessed, heard-about, inferred, and soon(vanValinandLaPolla1997;Aikhenvald2004).Differenttypesofevidencehave an effect on the way the factuality of an event is evaluated. For instance, something reported as seen can more easily be assessed as a fact than something reported as inferred.

Framework develops a taxonomy of the mechanisms employed for expressing sub-jective information such as attitude, its polarity, graduation, and so forth (Martin and White2005).

Inparticular,heusesthistermtoanalyzelinguisticconstructionsthatexpressdegrees fuzziness aspect of hedges, subsequent work extends the notion to include expres-sions for qualifying the degree of commitment of the writer with respect to what is asserted(Hyland[1996],amongothers).Bythisdefinition,hedgingandeventfactuality seem to be overlapping concepts. They differ on the extent of the phenomena they each cover, however. First, hedging is confined only to partial degrees of uncertainty, whereas factuality includes also the levels of absolute certainty. Second, in addition to degrees of writer X  X  commitment towards the veridicity of her statements, hedging (butnotfactuality)encompassesspeculativeexpressionsbelongingtootherscales,most sort of ,presentedbyLakoff[1973]),aswellaslackofknowledge(e.g, little is known ).
Polarity. Thesecondaxisconfiguringeventfactualityisthesystemofpolarity,socalled because it articulates the polar opposition between positive and negative contexts.
Due to its recent adoption in the NLP area of sentiment analysis, the term polarity is often taken to express only the direction of an opinion. Here, we use the term in its originalgrammaticalsense,thatis,asconveyingthedistinctionbetweenaffirmativeand negativecontexts(e.g.,Horn1989).Beingmoreabstract,thisdefinitionencompassesthe differentfacetsofthepositive/negativeopposition,andnotonlytheonethatisrelevant inopinionmining. 2.3 Key Elements in the Factuality System exploretheminthecurrentsection.

The factual value of markers such as possibly and probably is fairly transparent. What, however, is the contribution of elements like think , predict , suggest ,or seem ?
Interactions among factuality markers. The factuality status of a given event cannot be determined from the strictly local modality and polarity operators scoping over that event alone; rather, if present, other non-local markers must be considered as well to obtaintheadequateinterpretation.Consider: (6) a. SeveralEUmemberstateswill continue to allow passengersto carry duty-free allow , but receives a different interpretation depending on the elements scoping over that. In Example (6a), where allow is embedded under the factive predicate continue , carry ischaracterizedasafactintheworld.Example(6b),ontheotherhand,depictsitas acounterfactbecauseoftheeffectofthepredicate refuse scopingover allow ,andfinally,

Frequently sentences express more than one event (or proposition), each of them qualified with a different degree of certainty.

For example, thevisittothezoowithMaxinApril,IvetinAugust,andArletinDecemberarethree separateevents,giventhedifferenceinparticipantsandtemporallocation.Bycontrast, factuality is a matter of perspective.

It is not only the case that two participants can present different views about the same event, but also that the same (or different) participant presents adivergingviewatdifferentpointsintime.Consider: (10) a.

Factuality distinctions are established at a fine-grained level, and multiple perspectives on the same event are accounted for by means of the notion of source as a participant introduced by predicates of report, knowledge, belief, and so on. We begin by introducing the notion of a factuality profile (Section 3.1), and then formalize the basic components that have a role in it, namely:
ThealgorithmputtingalltheseingredientstogetherwillbepresentedinSection4. 3.1 The Factuality Profile of Events Whenever speakers talk about events, they qualify them with a degree of factuality.

Thevaluesforcharacterizingeventfactualitymustaccountfordistinctionsalongboth the polarity and the modality axes.

Event factuality is conveyed by means of explicit polarity and modality-denoting ex-pressions of a wide variety. Section 2.1 gave a brief introduction to the main types (namely, polarity and modality particles, the ESPs and syntactic constructions), and
Section2.3illustratedthenaturalinterplaythattakesplaceamongtheminthecontext of a sentence. In the current section we organize the factuality-relevant information present in lexical and syntactic structures so that it can be used by a model capable of accounting for the interaction of information across levels of embedding. The focus isonEnglishdata,buttheinformationiseasilyapplicabletootherlanguages, suchas thoseintheRomanceandGermanicfamilies. 12 factuality marker asthelevelofscopemostimmediatelyembeddingit.Forinstance,the context of the polarity particle never in Example (14) (subsequent paragraph) is set by themainclause. like nobody ) switch theoriginal polarity of itscontext (cf.Polanyi and Zaenen 2006): If itispositive,thepresenceofamarkerofnegativepolarityswitchesittonegative,and vice versa. Nothing changes if the original context is underspecified. For instance, in

Example (14c) the contextual polarity is underspecified, and so is the factuality value forevent train . (14) a.

Factualityinformationcanbealsoconveyedthroughsyn-tactic constructions involving subordination.

Thecoreprocedureofthefactualityprofilerappliestop X  X own,traversingadependency tree. Two reasons motivate a top X  X own approach. The first one is of empirical nature.
As seen, syntactic subordination is directly involved in the factual characterization of events (mainly through ESPs), and due to the recursive character of natural language, the factuality of a given event may depend on non-local information located several levelshigherinthetree(cf.thesetofsentencesinExample(6)).

De Facto, integrates the algorithm in the previous section, along with the linguistic resourceswithlexicalandsyntacticinformationstructuredaspresentedinSection3.4, andarticulatedaroundthescalardefinitionoffactualityvaluesdevelopedinSection3.2.

For developing and evaluating De Facto, we compiled FactBank, a corpus annotated with information concerning the factuality of events (Saur  X   X  and Pustejovsky 2009a). 286

TimeBank contains 183 documents (amounting to 88% of the documents in FactBank) and7,935events(83.6%oftheevents),andtheAQUAINTparthas25documents(12%) and1,553events(16.4%).

Furthermore, P&amp;R for the whole corpus is obtained by applying the measures of macro-and micro-averaging (last two columns in the table). Macro-averagingaveragestheresultobtainedineachclass,andmicro-averagingappliesover thesetofinstances,regardlessofclassdistribution.Thefirstmeasuregivesequalweight to each class and hence over-emphasizes the performance of the less populated ones, and the second one over-emphasizes the performance of the largest classes because it assigns equal weight to each instance.

 reason for that is the absence of event/source pairs tagged as NA by our system (as opposedtowhatwasappreciatedintheconfusionmatrixonTable7).Inthecorrected version, De Facto was able to follow the dependency tree, appropriately pair all the eventswiththeirsources,andreturnafactualityvalueforeachpair.

In addition, we added feature 13 given that our classifier was not aiming at identifying eventmentionsinthetext(contrarytoPrabhakaran,Rambow,andDiab X  X model),and features14and15tocopewithdistinctionsalongtheaxisofpolarity(notaddressedby thatsystem). the author source, but in our case an event can receive several factuality values from different sources.

The downside of that is potentially too much dependency on high quality linguistic data in order to obtain acceptable performance degrees.

De Facto, on the other hand, is grounded on thelinguisticexpressionthatarticulatesfactualitydistinctionsinnaturallanguage,and therefore does not depend as much on corpus size but on a good modeling of the interaction among the relevant linguistic structures. In this sense, the results shown herearequitepromisingregardingthecapabilitiesofoursystem,eventhoughitsuffers fromsomelimitations,aswillbeseennext. 5.4 Error Analysis

 to limitations in our system (84.4%), which mainly classify into insufficient coverage
Other disagreements are due to some inaccuracy in the gold standard annotation (7.5%), or to an incorrect analysis from the dependency parser which escaped our manual correction (8.1%). Table 11 shows the error type distribution, distinguishing betweenlexicalandsyntacticerrorwhenrelevant.

Insufficient coverage. Thereareanumberofsyntacticconstructionscruciallyinvolved in determining the factuality nature of events and which, nevertheless, have not been accountedforhere,mostcommonly:copulativephrases,cleftstructures(e.g., But it X  X  not equivalent). This amounts to 32.5% of the total error. De Facto also suffers from gaps at the lexical level, even though in a much lesser degree (1.9%). It lacks, for example, to do it ).

Ambiguity. De Facto does not cope with lexical polysemy of any type (18.1% of the total error). For example, the modal auxiliary would is employed in embedded contexts to express future (and hence CT +, which is how De Facto models this tense), buttherearecertainconstructionsinwhichitexpressessomedegreeofuncertainty.A furtherinterestingcaseinvolvesambiguityregardingthetemporalreferenceofevents.
De Facto assumes that aspectual predicates of termination (e.g., stop, finish ) qualify whereas the gold standard treats them as counterfactual (the event does not hold anymore).
 relativeandparticipialclauses,aswellasevent-denotingnouns,whenembeddedunder contexts of report, propositional attitudes, or uncertainty (28.1% of the total error).
Some of these ambiguities have long been discussed in the linguistics literature, and happened to be a source of remarkable disagreement among the FactBank annotators as well (cf. Saur  X   X  and Pustejovsky 2009b). The high error rate in this area seemed to suggest that the approach assumed in De Facto for these constructions (following Geurts [1998] and Glanzberg [2003]; see Section 3.4.4) was not completely adequate.
Thus,weexperimentedrunningDeFactowithoutthepartofthealgorithmdealingwith them(Algorithm2,lines1 X 9).Theresults,however,areinconclusive.Althoughthereis a slight improvement of 1 or 2 points over the F 1 of categories PS+ (from 0.59/0.61 to 0.61/0.63 when running on the original/corrected parses), and Uu (from 0.75/0.81 to 0.77/0.82 on the original/corrected parses), there is a decrease in other categories, such as PR+ (from 0.46 to 0.43, original parses) and CT  X  parses).

In some corpora, factuality-related information is annotated as information comple-mentary to the main phenomenon they target. It is, for instance, contemplated in different versions of the ACE corpus for the Event and Relation recognition task (see, e.g.,ACE2008),inthePennDiscourseTreeBank(Prasadetal.2007),andinTimeBank (Pustejovskyetal.2006).Inothercorpora,factualityinformationbecomestheepicenter of their annotations. For example, Rubin (2007, 2010) is concerned with the notion of certainty, the Language Understanding Annotation Corpus (Diab et al. 2009a) focuses on the author X  X  committed belief towards what is reported (a notion comparable to the modality axis in event factuality), and the small knowledge-intensive corpus by HenrikssonandVelupillai(2010)targetsdegreesofcertainty.

 determining the degree of factuality of events, but not sufficient if the values result-ing from these cues and their interactions are not provided. Complementary to this perspective, the second approach to factuality-related information puts the emphasis onidentifyingspeculativedegrees(alongthelinesassumedinthisarticle).Pioneering workwithinthisviewisLight,Qiu,andSrinivasan(2004),apaperexploringtheuseof speculativelanguageinsentencesfromMedlineabstracts.Itexperimentswithahand-craftedlistofhedgecuesaswellasasupervisedSVMinordertoclassifysentencesas either certain, high, or low speculative. Drawing on this, Medlock and Briscoe (2007) address the classification of sentences into speculative or non-speculative as a weakly supervised machine learning task and perform experiments with SVMs, achieving a precision-recall breakeven point of 0.76. This line of research is further explored by Szarvas (2008). On the other hand, Shatkay et al. (2008) use the corpus developed by

 multipleembeddings,nordistinguishbetweendifferentsources.Toourknowledge,the first system in which factuality-related information is computed applying top X  X own on a dependency tree, and hence potentially overcoming these limitations, is Nairn,
Condoravdi, and Karttunen (2006), who model the percolation of the polarity feature down the syntactic structure. A somewhat comparable perspective is adopted in the workonsentimentanalysisaddressingtheproblemfromacompositionalperspective.
Forexample,inMoilanenandPulman(2007)andMoilanen,Pulman,andZhang(2010) the well-known semantics principle of compositionality is applied for sentiment po-larity classification at the (sub)sentence level, and in Neviarouskaya, Prendinger, and
Ishizuka (2009), for recognizing emotions such as anger, guilt, or joy. All these cases involve the use of deep parsing and rich lexicons in a way very similar to the model presented here for event factuality. The main difference with respect to our approach, however, is that De Facto applies top X  X own, whereas these systems follow a bottom X  up processing of the data, as determined by the principle of compositionality. Such difference is not trivial. A top X  X own approach allows to keep track and compute the 294 nesting of the different sources involved in the factuality assessment, a computation thatdoesnotfollownaturallyfromprocessingbottom X  X p.

[2009b]) and approaches that distinguish among four (e.g., Henriksson and Velupillai 2010) or even five degrees (Rubin 2007, 2010). As a matter of fact, our linguistic-based distinctions are shared with the approach in Wilbur, Rzhetsky, and Shatkay (2006), the GENIA corpus (Kim, Ohta, and Tsujii 2008) and, in particular, that in Nawaz,
Thompson,andAnaniadou(2010). 7. Final Considerations Knowing the factuality status of event mentions in discourse is important for any
NLP task involving some degree of text understanding, but its identification presents tinuum, but a discrete scale appears to be a better approach for its automatic iden-tification. Second, the way language expresses the factuality of situations is complex because it involves multiple contributing and interrelating factors. And finally, the factuality of an event is always relative to the author but often involves other sources aswell.
 aim of contributing to a better understanding of this level of speculation in language.
The model is based on the grammatical structuring of factuality in languages such as English, and addresses the three aforementioned challenges. Specifically, it rests different sources (with potentially contradictory views), and it is strongly grounded on the information provided by linguistic operators (including polarity and modality particles,predicatesofdifferenttypes,andsubordinationconstructions)togetherwith theircross-levelinteractions.
