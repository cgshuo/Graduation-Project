 1. Introduction and motivation
Citation analysis, along with peer judgments and assessments of publication counts, is one of the most widely used meth-search.

As the fast development of bioinformatics as well as tremendous increase in the number of biomedical publications,
The TREC Genomics tracks organized by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology provided several benchmark datasets and relevance assessments to accelerate research in biomedical literature retrieval. Many research groups joined these annual campaigns to test their methods and systems. However, surprisedly, the citation information as an intuitive evidence that could be employed for improving literature retrieval performance was not used and tested in Genomics tracks medical literature retrieval is still uncleared.

In order to determine whether algorithms developed for the World Wide Web can be applied to the biomedical domain, Bern-scores can improve biomedical text retrieval accuracy.
 As described above, mining linkage information can help to improve the effectiveness of biomedical literature retrieval.
However, most previous studies of combining linkage information with content information are based on the empirical lin-exhaustive parameter tuning based on a training dataset is unavoidable. Therefore, how to exploit content information lem, a probabilistic model that integrated content matching and three uses of link information was introduced in Jin and mations to PageRank, in-degree, URL Length and Click Distance, then combined them with a BM25 baseline to improve Web erature retrieval.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows: First, we propose a general probabilistic combination framework that integrates the citation context into the content-based probabilistic weighting model. Second, based on a case study conducted on a subset of MEDLINE literature dataset, we find that the simple linkage analysis algorithm, Degree Distri-algorithms. Hence, the linkage information in this paper is based on degree, in-degree and out-degree distributions of nodes in a citation graph. Third, two strategies for modeling the linkage information are proposed, namely Model 1 which estimates the citation link distributions on a training dataset, and Model 2 which directly approximates the fre-as the content-based retrieval baseline, which employs BM25 ( Robertson &amp; Walker, 1994 ) as its weighting function.
Extensive experiments and systematic comparisons are conducted on three years TREC Genomics track datasets. Exper-imental results show that mining the linkage information from the citation graph with Model 2 and combining it with content-based information under the general combination framework can substantially and stably improve the retrieval performances.

In our preliminary study, we linearly combined content-based ranking scores with linkage-based ranking scores calcu-
We also include an additional Genomics collection to test the proposed approach with more extensive experiments and more comprehensive discussions and conclusive findings are included in this paper.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a case study of combining content-based ranking results and linkage-based ranking results. A general probabilistic combination framework is proposed in Section 3 .
Experimental results followed by analyses and discussions are presented in Sections 4 and 5 . Conclusions are presented in Section 6 . 2. Background: a case study
In order to find out how the most popular linkage analysis algorithms influence the performance of biomedical literature based ranking scores calculated by the PageRank, HITS and Degree Distribution algorithms respectively ( Yin, Huang, Hu, study. 2.1. Method
The TREC 2007 Genomics dataset is used as the testing dataset in this case study. The evaluation measure used here is the document mean average precision (MAP) ( Buckley &amp; Voorhees, 2005 ). The content-based information retrieval (IR) results are from the probabilistic model based Okapi IR system, which uses about the Okapi IR system is introduced in Section 4.2 .

A citation graph is constructed on the 2007 Genomics dataset. In the citation graph, biomedical literatures are repre-sented as nodes, and citation relationships among literatures are represented as directed edges. Therefore, linkage-based
HITS and Degree Distribution, three famous algorithms are used to calculate linkage ranking scores. We briefly describe these three linkage analysis algorithms as follows:
Degree Distribution (in-degree) is a simple node importance ranking algorithm, which ranks documents according to their &amp; Tsaparas, 2005 ).

PageRank extends Degree Distribution algorithm, which considers links between nodes with different weights, proposed by Brin and Page in 1998. The PageRank algorithm performs a random walk on the graph that simulates the behavior of a of a Web page A as: where PR  X  T i  X  denotes the PageRank of document T i which cites document A in our experiments. C  X  T references in document T i . And d 2 X  0 ; 1 is a damping factor which is usually set to 0.85 ( Brin &amp; Page, 1998 ).
HITS introduced by Kleinberg (1999) , is a more refined algorithm for calculating the importance of Web pages. The impor-resource itself. HITS computes two vectors of scores, which are defined as: where A in our experiments is the adjacency matrix of the citation graph, A wise, A ij  X  0 ; ~ a is authority vector where i th element denotes the authority score of document i ; while vector hub scores of documents.
 Similar to many previous studies, we combine two kinds of ranking scores based on the empirical linear combination: where k is the combination parameter. The optimal value of the k , namely the value that can be used to maximize the doc-ument MAP, is obtained by an ad-hoc approach. 2.2. Observations terms of document MAP when k P 0 : 8. But it is worth noting that among three algorithms, Degree Distribution outperforms PageRank and HITS. It is apparent that the document MAP is effected by k .

Experiments are also conducted on five Okapi baseline runs. We set different values to BM25 parameters k citation graph can achieve performance improvements on all chosen Okapi baseline runs. In Table 1 , Integrate achieves higher document MAP than the best result that was reported in the TREC 2007 Genomics track ( Hersh, Cohen, Rus-tuning is necessary when applying the method to different IR baseline runs.
 outperforms HITS. Consequently, we consider that compared with PageRank and HITS, Degree Distribution is a better choice for biomedical literature retrieval. We can also see that it is important to choose the optimal value of the combination parameter k for a better retrieval performance. Apparently, the empirical linear combination method is not the best way more flexible, a more decent combination method is required. 3. Our approach
In order to improve biomedical literature retrieval accuracy, we propose a general combination framework for integrating age information from a citation graph as an additional evidence to improve the weighting of documents. 3.1. A combination framework
We define a query q  X f q 1 ; q 2 ; ... ; q k g and the content of a document d  X f x document. If a word x i matches one of the query terms q j document is determined by an  X  X  X dds Ratio X  ( Robertson &amp; Jones, 1976 ). Formally, O  X  R j q ; d  X  X  sent  X  X  X elevant X  and  X  X  X on-relevant X  respectively.

In order to combine linkage information with content-based weighting model, we use L tion of a document d . Meanwhile, we make the following two assumptions: (1) the content of a document and the linkage information of this document are conditionally independent; (2) A document is represented as an unordered collection of conditionally independent words. Based on the above, the probabilistic framework that combines the content-based weight-ing and the linkage weighting can be expressed as:
In Eq. (5) , p  X  R j q  X  p  X  NR j q  X  is constant for each query. So O  X  R j q ; d ; L (5) , the log odds ratio can be written as: (1994) . Finally, it can be written as the BM25 weighting function.
 2005; Dorogovtsev &amp; Mendes, 2003 ), we define L d as P and the i th document. If a citation relationship exists between two documents, then L can be classified into three types: (1) Degree ,if L d i is defined as a directional citation link, L
L is adjacent to the node d or the tail endpoint of L d i is adjacent to the node d ; (2) InDegree ,if L citation link, L d i  X  1 if and only if the head endpoint of L
OutDegree ,if L d i is defined as a directional citation link, L then L d is the out-degree of the node d .

Note that Eq. (6) presents the proposed combination framework of integrating linkage information into the content-based pose two models for computing the linkage weighting of Eq. (6) . 3.2. Modeling linkage information
In this section, two models for the linkage information are proposed. The first model is based on distribution parameter based on the linkage information between two documents L d 3.2.1. Using parameter estimation: Model 1 negative binomial distribution that can account for overdispersion ( Tague, 1981 ). Therefore, we consider that  X  L  X  L j NR ; q  X  are subject to the negative binomial distributions: be expressed as: can be evaluated on the testing queries. Different estimated values can be obtained with the use of Degree, InDegree and
OutDegree scores. More details are shown in Section 4.3 . 3.2.2. Using frequency approximation: Model 2
Instead of estimating link distribution parameters as Model 1, we directly approximate link frequency with Model 2. Gi-ven a query q and the linkage information L d  X  P N i L d N = the number of documents in the collection, R = the number of relevant documents for query q , n = the number of documents which L d i  X  1, r = the number of relevant documents which L d i  X  1, consider the contingency of link distribution for L d i shown in Table 2 .
 We define two variables: p i  X  P  X  L d i  X  1 j R ; q  X  X  r works very well empirically. Eq. (10) thus can be presented as:
L . Therefore, the linkage weighting can be computed as:
D graph. 4. Experimental results 4.1. Experiment settings The Text REtrieval Conference (TREC), co-sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and US methodologies. Therefore, we choose the following three TREC datasets for our experiments.

TREC 2006 and 2007 Genomics datasets are full-text biomedical corpus consisting of 162,259 documents from 49 genom-ics-related journals indexed by MEDLINE. Documents in the datasets are in HTML format, and can be identified by their 2007 Genomics track are used as queries.

TREC 2005 Genomics dataset consists of 10 years of completed literature abstracts from MEDLINE exclusive from 1994 to the other two datasets, the 2005 Genomics dataset does not include the  X  X  REFERENCES  X  section. mation. Thus the citation graph built on 2005 Genomics dataset is an incomplete graph.

Genomics datasets only present a fraction of millions of biomedical literatures indexed by MEDLINE. However, to the best medical literature retrieval research so far.

Evaluation measures for both TREC 2006 and 2007 Genomics tracks were three level MAPs, namely document MAP, pas-sage MAP and aspect MAP. The definitions of these MAPs can be found in Hersh et al. (2007) . TREC 2005 Genomics track cus on document MAP 6 since both the linkage-based weighting and the content-based weighting in our framework are calcu-lated on document level. Also, document MAP is one of the most widely used measures in information retrieval. 4.2. Content-based IR system
We use Okapi Basic Search System as the content-based IR baseline run. Okapi is an information retrieval system based on the probabilistic model of Robertson and Jones (1976) . Retrieved documents from Okapi are ranked in the order of their probabilities of relevance to the query. Search term is assigned weight based on its within-document term frequency and query term frequency. The weighting function used is BM25. age document length, nq is the number of query terms, the k sibly on the nature of the queries and are empirically determined), K equals to k constant and indicates that its following component is added only once per document. In our experiments, the tuning con-stants k 1 and b are set to be different values. k 2 and k
In order to find out wether the proposed methods can work well on strong baselines as well as on average and weak base-line with medium document MAP, randomly choose three baselines from all baselines except the two baselines we already chose. Table 3 shows the performances and parameter settings of baseline runs used in our experiments. It is worth men-tioning that baseline runs Okapi05e and Okapi07e achieve higher document MAPs on Genomics 2005 X  X  and 2007 X  X  topics than the best results (automatic) that were reported in 2005 and 2007 Genomics tracks respectively ( Hersh et al., 2007, in TREC 2006 Genomics track ( Hersh et al., 2006 ). The best and mean results in terms of document MAP for 2005-2007

As introduced in Section 3.2.2 , Model 2 using the link frequency approximation method is another way of modeling the linkage weighting. Testing experimental results on Genomics 2005 X  X , 2006 X  X  and 2007 X  X  topics are shown in Tables 7 X 9 respectively, where means improvements over the Okapi baselines are statistically significant (Wilcoxon test at signifi-performance improvements on all baseline runs. Since only 10% of documents X  reference information in 2005 Genomics two algorithms. 5. Analysis and discussion 5.1. Effect of linkage weighting
As shown in Figs. 2 X 5 , combining the content weighting with the linkage weighting under the probabilistic combination framework can improve biomedical literature retrieval accuracy. Performance improvements can be observed over all base-line runs on both 2006 X  X  and 2007 X  X  topics.

From Figs. 2 and 3 , we can see that, for Model 1 the  X  X  X utDegree X  algorithm outperforms the  X  X  X nDegree X  algorithm. We consider that this is due to the difference of the distribution of L rithm achieves higher document MAPs compared with the  X  X  X utDegree X  algorithm when using Model 2. From Section 3.2.2 we can see that the linkage weighting of a document increases with the document X  X  degree, in-degree or out-degree using out-degree of the literature contains more useful information which results in the  X  X  X egree X  algorithm performs the best. 5.2. Comparison of two models In Section 3.2 , we introduced two models for the linkage weighting. Model 1 using the parameter estimation method and
Model 2 using the link frequency approximation method. The comparisons of the effectiveness of these two models in terms of document MAP are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 .  X  X  X egree06M1 X  and  X  X  X egree07M1 X  denote systems that use Model 1 with the denotes the system that uses Model 2 with the  X  X  X egree X  algorithm.
 Fig. 6 shows document MAP values on 2006 X  X  topics. Both models can improve retrieval accuracy over baseline runs.
However, for all baseline runs,  X  X  X egreeM2 X  using Model 2 outperforms  X  X  X egree07M1 X  using Model 1. Similar results are observed when experiments are conducted on 2007 X  X  topics. As shown in Fig. 7 , Model 2 ( X  X  X egreeM2 X ) still achieves higher document MAP than Model 1 ( X  X  X egree06M1 X ) on all baseline runs. Therefore, we consider that Model 2 is more suitable for biomedical literature retrieval compared to Model 1. This may lie in that the parameter estimation method used in Model 1 is a query-dependent method, the gap existed between training queries and testing queries results in over-fitting the training data. On the other hand, no training data is needed for Model 2. Thus, Model 2 is obviously more practical and simpler. Experimental results indicate the stability of Model 2 and its insensitivity with respect of queries.
 5.3. Comparison of combination methods
Most previous studies of utilizing linkage information to improve retrieval accuracy are based on the empirical linear combination method, which formally can be presented as: Score combination framework is derived from the query-relevant  X  X  X dds Ratio X  directly and naturally incorporates the linkage weighting with the content weighting. So it is worthwhile to compare the effectiveness of these two combination methods. employed the empirical linear combination.  X  X  X egreeM2 X  denotes the system that uses the general probabilistic combination framework with Model 2 and  X  X  X egree X  algorithm.  X  X  X egree06M1 X  and  X  X  X egree07M1 X  denote the systems that use the com-bination framework with Model 1,  X  X  X egree X  algorithm, and the link distribution parameters are estimated on 2006 X  X  topics and 2007 X  X  topics respectively.
 It is obvious that the general probabilistic combination framework with Model 2 performs the best on all baseline runs.
The performances of systems that use the combination framework with Model 1 are comparable with the performances of systems that use the empirical linear combination. The document MAPs achieved by the empirical linear combination are combination framework does not need parameter tuning when applying it to different content-based baseline runs. More-val performance. Since the exhaustive parameter tuning can be avoided when using the proposed combination framework, we can expect it is also more applicable in real applications. 5.4. Results on 2005 genomics dataset
The TREC 2005 Genomics dataset contains over 4 million biomedical citations. However, it is not a full-text collection,
Experimental results on 2006 and 2007 Genomics dataset demonstrate that Model 2 is simpler as well as more applicable for modeling the linkage weighting. Hence, we only apply Model 2 to the 2005 Genomics dataset. Experimental results on 2005 Genomics dataset shown in Table 7 indicate that the probabilistic combination framework can promote both document
MAP and R-Precision. However, the performance improvements on 2005 X  X  topics are not as significant as improvements on 2006 X  X  and 2007 X  X  topics. This can be explained by the incompletion of the citation graph and the lose of some important linkage information.

From Fig. 10 , we can see that improvements on R-Precision are more significant. This indicates that our approach can put more relevant documents in top R positions of the ranking list, where R equals to the number of documents that are judged as relevant documents for the topics by domain experts and biologists.
 5.5. Discussions
For combining multiple evidences with baseline ranking, there are mainly three broad approaches: the first approach is the rank-based combination; the second approach is combining an evidence as a language modeling prior; and the third ap-lely on ranks, which has the advantage of ignoring the score distributions. However, ranking scores containing more information, should be used. In a language modeling framework, prior probabilities were calculated for document length adjustment methods.

The probabilistic combination framework derived from the query-relevant  X  X  X dds Ratio X  directly provides the combina-tion of content-based information and linkage-based information a theoretical support. The proposed combination approach not only outperforms the empirical linear combination method, but is also more intuitively understandable. Moreover, exhaustive manual search for the empirical optimal value of the combination parameter can be avoided.
