 Complex network can be observed all over the place in the world, e.g., WWW, ci-tation networks, protein reaction network among others. It is reported that these complex networks often have the propert ies of scale free and/or small world[1] which means these networks are not a simple random or regular network. Analyz-ing network properties is one of the effective way to understand a structure and relationships among objects. Moreover , since most of the networks in the real world change over time, it is important to investigate not only a snapshot but also growth of the network, e.g., Leskovec et. al. studied the growth of citation network and reported densification power law[2].

Meanwhile, this paper focuses on physical damage on a fuel cell. Fuel cell is regarded as a highly efficient power generation system as well as low-pollution. However, a crucial issue in putting SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell) into practi-cal use is the establishment of a techniqu e for evaluating the deterioration of SOFC in the operating environment[3]. Since SOFC operate in a harsh environ-ment (i.e., high temperature, oxidation-reduction), this causes decrement of the reaction area by chemical/physical degradation, consequently the cell loses its performance. We (two of the co-authors) have previously developed a technique to measure the mechanical damage of SOFC using the Acoustic Emission (AE) method[4]. AE is an elastic wave (i.e., vibration, sound wave including ultrasonic wave) produced by expansion/contraction/crack/friction of materials[5]. The fi-nal goal of our research is to establish a technique to estimate damage type and clarify fracture mechanism (pattern).
 We have conducted an initial experiment using Sequence-based SOM (Self-Organizing Map)[7], which we modified the original SOM[6], assuming a group of similar AE waves represen ts certain type of damage. However, several AE waves (overlapped) AE types by cluster analysis since it does not represent relationship between objects. Therefore this pap er employed neighbor network, TOP k and k -MNN (Mutually Neighbor Network) are employed, which reflects the shared latent AE types implicitly (Fig.1). Network structure can be patterns of shared latent AE types, and also if occurrence pattern of latent AE types change as damage progresses, it should affect growth of the network. Hence, this paper studied the network growth in terms of typ ical network characteristics: power index of degree, cluster coefficient, and effective diameter. We confirmed from the results that the power index of degree dynamically changes as state of materials change. Also the decrease of cluster coe fficient and shrinking effective diameter in k -MNN network reflect the occurrence of various damage combinations as lowering the temperature. 2.1 Similarity Measure In advance of network construction, sim ilarity between extracted two AE waves where  X  x is a time-domain feature vector and  X  x is a spectrum-domain feature vector. Here, the time-doma in consist of the following 7 features[8]: duration, maximum amplitude, root mean square, cr est factor, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Also spectrum-domain features consist of K PC (Principal Component) score of the power spectrum obtained by PCA. All features are normalized to be each average is equal to zero and the sta ndard deviation is equal to one. Then similarity measure S ( x i , x j )isgivenby: where f s ( a , b )=exp  X  a  X  b / X  2 is a Gaussian function that maps Euclidean distance of two objects into [0 , 1]. Also  X   X  (0 , 1] is a balancing parameter be-tween time-and spectrum-domain features, and  X  is a scaling parameter,  X  =1 . 0 is used in this work. 2.2 TOP k Network N  X  N adjacency matrix of TOP k network A =( a x j by eq.(1) among the ranking of similarity between the nodes (AE waves) is within top k among all the combination. Since this network is an undirected graph, only the part i&lt;j is used. 2.3 k -MNN Network N  X  N adjacency matrix of k -Mutually Nearest Neighbor (MNN) network B = ( b i,j )isgivenby: within k nearest neighbor of x i and vice versa. 2.4 Configuration of Growth Network Though the configuration is backward removing process, which removes a node and related links at time t , once the network is configured the growth process can be replayed forward. Power Index of Degree. A network whose degree distribution follows power Cluster Coefficient. We employed the definition of cluster coefficient based Effective Diameter. We employed the effective diameter[2] that is the mini-4.1 Damage Evaluation Test Settings The schematic layout of the SOFC X  X  performance test apparatus is shown in glass ring (Fig.3). AE measurement was d one by using a wide-band piezoelectric transducer 1 . The AE transducer was attached to the outer Al 2 O 3 tube away from the heated section. The sampling rate is 10  X  6 sec, thus the maximum frequency is 500 KHz. The bar graph in Fig.3 indicates AE energy, which corresponds to the occurrence frequency of AE signals at that time.

Through 60 hours of running SOFC, 1429 AE waves were extracted by the burst extraction method[10], where the maximum burst level was set to five. From these AE waves, we prepared TOP 5000, 10000 and 15-, 30-MNN networks, where the number of links in 15-and 30-MNN networks were 5347 and 10818, respectively. 4.2 Network Overview Overview of the TOP 5000 network and the 15-MNN network are shown in Fig.4 and Fig.5, where only the maximum connection components are depicted. The networks are visualized by using Cytoscape 2 and the layout is done by the weighted spring embedded. Note that similarity values are used as the weights, however, the values are used only for visualization. Size of a node indicates the maximum burst level of correspond AE wave that represents damage scale. More-over, the networks are split into groups by means of Fast Modularity Community Structure Inference Algorithm 3 [11]. The balancing parameter in the similarity measure by eq.(1) was set to  X  =0 . 4 which gives the highest modularity (in average of four networks) among the candidates { 0 . 1 , 0 . 2 ,  X  X  X  , 0 . 9 } .
TOP 5000 network has a core in the center and there are mainly three groups around the core, while 15-MNN network has mainly five groups and the center seems almost random network.These groups are expected to be the same damage type, while diverse-linked AE waves can be considered as complex waves that contains various latent AE types. Mor eover, the nodes between the groups are expected to be AE waves that share latent AE types of both groups. 4.3 Change in Degree Distribution Fig.6 and Fig.7 show change in power index of degree over time. Corresponding actual time and temperature are indicated in Fig.3. The networks whose con-figuration is the same (TOP k or k -MNN) show the same trend even though k changed. However, TOP k and k -MNN networks show greatly different trends. The power index in both networks change up and down rapidly till about t = 400, afterwards it gradually increases in TOP k network, while it gradually decreases in k -MNN network. In particular, k -MNN network does not follow power law in the last part and around t = 100. This result is reasonable because k -MNN net-work is limited to have k links per node even though possible nodes are increasing.
An interesting part from perspective of damage progress is that dynamical changing points, t =50  X  100 , 200  X  300, can be considered as phase transition points in the damage progress. Actually, heating period is till t = 113 from Fig.3 that damage types different from l owering period may occur. While about t = 200  X  300, we have already confirmed by the previous work that is sequential cluster analysis using Sequence-based SOM[7], very large AE waves overlapping a lot of latent AE types, which may be high degree nodes, were produced in this period. This is probably a crack progress because of the initial small cracks or unevenness of the material, which is not serious damage. The result conforms with the previous work. 4.4 Change in Cluster Coefficient Fig.8 and Fig.9 show change in cluster coefficient over time. Both networks, TOP k and k -MNN, show similar trends, it gra dually decreases. Although the number of links are almost the same between TOP k and k -MNN networks, the gradient in k -MNN network is higher than that of TOP k . This is because that k -MNN network grew from clustered area s and then diverse-linked area grew, which is the center area in Fig.5 and does not appear in TOP k network. We also confirmed this growth process by time-seri es visualization (though the detail is spared because of short of space). Thi s growth process could not be found by the previous work[7].
 4.5 Change in Effective Diameter Lastly, Fig.10 and Fig.11 show change in effective diameter over time. The diam-eter increased and ne arly steadied in TOP k network. While in k -MNN network, it rapidly increased till about t = 300( k = 15) and 500( k = 30) as clustered ar-eas grew. Since these areas are not highly connected each other, it becomes long diameter. Afterwards, as di verse-linked area grew the diameter is getting shorter since shortcuts within the network increase. This shrinking diameter may be by the same reason that we discusse d about cluster coefficient.

We can speculate from the result abo ut damage progress as follows. Since glass seal does not solidify till about 400  X  C(t=300, turning point of the diam-eter), almost single type of damage o ccur even containing several latent AE types. However, as solidifying the glass seal and compressing the electrodes and the electrolyte (after 400  X  C), chaining various types of damages may occur such trodes and electrolyte. This may produce various combination of AE types, which leads growth of the diverse-linked area. We analyzed the growth of neighbor networks, namely TOP k and k -Mutually Neighbor networks, on observed AE waves that is damage progress in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell. The results show that the power index of degree dynamically changes when the occurrence pattern of AE dynamically changed, which was a reason-able result. Also decrease of cluster coefficient and shrinking effective diameter in k -MNN network reflect occurrence of div erse-linked waves which is various combination of damages. This is initial experiments trying to see the effective-ness of network analysis for AE waves, other network analysis, e.g., correlation among neighbors, should be studied.
