 A special issue on Algorithms and Resources for Online Reputation Management AIMS AND SCOPE In recent years, Online Reputation Management (ORM) has become an indispensable part of corporate marketing strategy. It allows companies to be aware of the content published online in relation to their brands and to react accordingly.
The spectacular growth of ORM is linked to the increased popularity of social media that allow information to spread quickly and widely, multiplying the potential reputational impact. However, the volume of news and user-generated content produced every day prohibits its manual analysis, motivating the development of advanced, automatic methods to process large amounts of data. For such methods to be successful, collaborations between professional reputation analysts and academic and industrial experts in information retrieval, natural language processing, and related communities are needed. One crucial problem to date has been the lack of standardized test collections for ORM that allow for systematic comparisons of industrial solutions and research prototypes, as well as a consensus on problem statements, evaluation methodologies and metrics.

RepLab, a competitive evaluation campaign for ORM technologies organized for the first time at the CLEF Conference in 2012, fills the gap by providing standardized test collections as well as a platform for networked discussion and formalization of the main technical challenges.

In its successive campaigns (2012 X 2014), RepLab has tackled tasks such as filtering, classification, and clustering of Twitter posts and profiles, focusing on specific ORM needs and dealing with company relatedness, topic similarity, author influence, reputation polarity, and reputation dimensions.

The RepLab task definitions and resources -created in collaboration with ORM experts -have been made available to the research community and are being adopted by researchers. After three years of RepLab, we can conclude that the datasets, evaluation methodology, metrics, and -most importantly -the research developed in the context of RepLab has produced advances in the state of the art for automatic approaches to ORM-related problems, motivating the compilation of this Special Issue.
