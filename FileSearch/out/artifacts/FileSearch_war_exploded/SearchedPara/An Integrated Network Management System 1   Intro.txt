 to network operation, user management and security management are becoming more communication network is required to provide high-level QoS and more bandwidth to increasingly.
 breaker? When network is congested, how can we find the bottleneck rapidly? How to management system (short for NMS) which we are using in our campus for our daily CERNet. 2.1 Functions 2.1.1 Traffic Monitoring protocol analysis. hosts whose traffic exceeds the criterion established by CERNET. information, interdict the connection when necessary. impacted by burst traffic. targets, which all can be taken as auditing factors. 2.1.2 Charge Management user-info-maintenance, are provided in the User-Management Module. 2.1.3 Address Management granted at any moment. Devices of Cisco and HUAWEI are supported. 2.1.4 Access Admission Access admission includes source-based admission and target-based admission. In the traffic by comparing the domestic route table maintained by CERNET. 2.1.5 User Self-service password, query his deposit status and access details. 2.2 Technical Characteristics To utilize high performance of Linux kernel in our NMS, we adopt module-in-kernel mode instead of kernel-user space mode in which much data are transferred between between kernel and user-space are greatly reduced, performance of the NMS is much improved. address, protocol, source port number and destination port number. 
MySQL DLLs are employed in the NMS to build an embedded database server. It When publishing the NMS, copyright and installation of database system are no more restricted. 
An embedded Web sever is also employed in the NMS. With its help, TCP performance of TCP redirection and interdictions of unauthorized access. TCP redirection is employed to interdict all the unauthorized access. By modifying no enough fee in his account. 
Dynamic protocol analysis is employed to summarize and analyze composition of intuitional visualization programming technique. and IP spoofing. It enables to improve the network more secure and traceable. 2.3 Architecture network, and it can be deployed in two methods: Bypass and Gateway. 2.3.1 Bypass NMS analyzes the traffic, configures access-control and carries out accounting. TCP flows can be interrupted or redirected by modifying TCP Three-Way Handshake. This cause single point fault or impact performance of the exporting link. 2.3.2 Gateway method can only monitor the TCP traffic. 2.4 Running Environment In the NMS, basic hardware configuration includes PIII500 CPU, 256M memory  X  2G disk-space, two 100M/1000M network interface cards. As to software, Linux Kernel 2.4 and MySQL v4.0 are required. and effectively.
