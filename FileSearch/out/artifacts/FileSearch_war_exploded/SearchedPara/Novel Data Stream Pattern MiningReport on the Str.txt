 This report summarizes the First International Workshop on International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, on July 25 2010 in Washington, DC. Data stream mining has gained in importance over the last years because it is indispensable for many real applications such as prediction and evolution of weather phenomena; security and anomaly detection in networks; evaluating satellite data; and mining health monitoring streams. Stream mining algorithms must take into account the unique properties of stream data, including temporal ordering, concept drifts and shifts, demand for scalability and that the data are unbounded.
 This workshop brought together scholars working in different areas of learning on streams, including sensor data and news streams. Most of the contributions were on unsupervised learning with clustering methods. Issues addressed included the detection of outliers and anomalies, evolutionary clustering and incremental clustering, learning in subspaces of the complete feature space and learning with exploitation of context, deriving models from text streams and visualizing them.
 The workshop received 15 submissions, from which 8 papers were accepted after a desk evaluation and a review process by two to three reviewers. The best paper of the workshop (see below) was selected for inclusion in this issue, as an extended version. All other workshop papers are available in the ACM Digital Library. The workshop was well attended with lively discussions and question sessions. In this report we discuss the works presented at the workshop, grouped into the following thematic areas: data mining on multiple data streams (section 2), detection of concept drift and outliers (section 3), and stream clustering (section 4). Dr. Le Gruenwald, IIS Program Director at NSF and Professor at the University of Oklahoma delivered the Keynote speech for the workshop. MDS involves examining disparate heterogeneous data sources with different characteristics and timing constraints. After introducing the concept of multiple data streams (MDS), she discussed some of the complex research issues associated with mining of MDS. Much work as been devoted to MDS within the database community, but there is still too little research on mining these streams. Dr. Grunewald urged data mining researchers to start to address some of these complex problems .
 In fact, MDS is the subject of the Best Paper of the workshop. In  X  X ully Decentralized Computation of Aggregates over Data Streams X  [2], Beccetti et al proposed a novel technique to perform aggregate operations on multiple data streams. The environment examined is one where many different nodes each receive data from a data stream and need to combine them for delivery to a collecting agent or coordinating node. To this purpose, each node keeps a summary, sketch, of the stream data it has seen. Sketch updates are propagated to neighbor nodes when the sketch values are deemed to be sufficiently different from the last propagation. In this manner, information concerning aggregation values ultimate migrates to all nodes in the network. Data streams usually exhibit concept drifts that occur slowly, or shifts that emerge suddenly. A crucial problem is distinguishing between a change of the concept and the appearance of outliers. At StreamKDD, we had three papers devoted to this subject. In [3] the authors outlined the approach they are currently working on for the detection of outliers: they use a density based approach to create an outlier score for an incoming point and decide whether a data point is an outlier, before the next one arrives. The authors of [4] propose CALDS, a context based learning technique that detects concept drift by exploiting context. The authors focus on context recurrence within the stream. To address this problem they propose to learn multiple models and apply the most fitting one when the context changes. New models are created if the arriving data are too dissimilar to all existing models.
 The third paper in this area examined the prediction of anomalies in the trajectories of ships [5]. For this trajectory surveillance application, the authors use conformal prediction. As a maxim, data stream clustering should be online, incremental, and single pass. Three StreamKDD papers investigated different aspects of this topic. Evolutionary clustering was examined in [6], focusing on the changes encountered in a sequence of clusters over text data, such as news feeds. Remarkably, the core idea is in combining stream clustering with frequent itemset mining over the feature space. In [7], the authors propose a clustering approach that adapts density based clustering to subspace clustering using a preference weighted distance function, by extending the algorithm PREDECON [9] into an incremental method.
 The last workshop paper proposed a visualization technique for news streams [8], based on heat maps, whereby heat models the frequency of occurrence of articles in different clusters over time. The first StreamKDD workshop at the ACM SIGKDD International Conference in 2010 has been motivated by research advances on data streams that were reported in the earlier KDD conferences, adjoint workshops and tutorials. The intention of StreamKDD X 10 has been to bring the researchers who contribute to the field together for the sharing of ideas and the identification of new research challenges. The contributing authors, the evaluating reviewers, and the engaged audience made StreamKDD X 10 a success. We would like to thank all authors who submitted papers to this workshop. Their work and their presentations were the key to the workshop X  X  success.
