 1. Introduction
Due to the imperfection of image acquisition systems and transmission channels, images are often corrupted by noise. This degradation leads to a significant reduction of image quality and then makes more difficult to perform high-level vision tasks such as recognition, 3-D reconstruction, or scene interpretation. The image denoising is important, not only because of the evident applications it serves. Being the simplest possible inverse problem, it provides a convenient platform over which image-processing ideas and techniques can be assessed. In most cases, this corruption is commonly modeled by a zero-mean additive white Gaussian random noise leading to the following additive
The wavelet transform can achieve good sparsity for spatially localized details, such as edges and singularities. Because such details are typically abundant in natural images and convey a significant portion of the information embedded therein, wavelet transform has found a significant application for image denoising. Recently, a number of advanced denoising methods based on wavelet transforms have been developed ( Dabov et al., 2007; et al., 2008; Pizurica and Philips, 2006; Scheunders, 2004 ). For typical natural images, most of the wavelet coefficients have very small magnitudes, except for a few large ones that represent important high-frequency features of the image such as edges. Since white noise is distributed evenly among all wavelet coefficients, removing small wavelet coefficients decreases most of the noise energy while preserving most of the image energy. This explains why as simple an operation as thresholding in the wavelet domain can effectively reduce noise while preserving image edges. Thresholding is just a very simple way to take advantage of the sparseness property of wavelet transform. Recently, multiple wavelet basis image-denoising methods ( Choi and Baraniuk, 2004; Zhu et al., 2008; Eslami and Radha, 2007 ) have been proposed, which generally may produce better denoising results than the conventional ones. The success of wavelet is mainly due to the good performance for piecewise smooth functions in one dimension. Unfortunately, this ability is lost when it is applied to two dimension or higher, and the inherent limitation of wavelets in higher dimension comes clearer and clearer. In essence, wavelets are good at catch zeroth-dimensional (point) singularities. However, 2-D piecewise smooth signals such as images always have first-order and zeroth-order singularity. In addition, 2-D wavelet transform commonly uses separate wavelet basis, which is obtained by applying a 1-D the 1-D singularity. To overcome the weaknesses of wavelets in high dimensions, researchers have recently considered multiscale and directional representations that can capture the intrinsic geometrical structures such as smooth contours in natural images, and proposed a serious of effective image-noising algorithms. Some examples include the curvelet transform ( Bao et al., 2008 ), contourlet transform ( Cunha and Zhou, 2006 , bandelet transform Mallat and LePennec, 2005 ), and ridgelets transform ( Chen and respective classes of noise, the distributions of which are presumed to be known. But, image denoising is usually particu-larly challenging for cases where we know little about the noise distribution.

Support vector machine (SVM) is a novel machine learning method introduced by Vapnik (1998) in early 1990s. SVM has been successfully applied to numerous classification and pattern recognition problems such as text categorization, image recogni-tion and bioinformatics. SVM-based classifier is built to minimize Therefore, SVM is claimed to lead enhanced generalization properties. Further, application of SVM results in the global solution for a classification problem. SVM-based classification is attractive, because its efficiency does not directly depend on the very useful in fault diagnostics, because the number of fault classification features does not have to be drastically limited. Cheng et al. (2004) proposed a manipulation of wavelet coefficients for the suppression of noise in images by fusing the wavelet transform with support vector regression (SVR). Zhang and Chen (2006) constructed a denoising system, which learns an optimal mapping from the input data to denoised data. The Morlet feature space SVM models take the form y  X  x  X  X  x T j  X  x  X  X  b  X  2  X  where the nonlinear mapping j  X  U  X  maps the input vector into a weight vector of the same dimension as the feature space.
SVM formulations start from the assumption that the linear separable case is x T x i  X  b Z  X  1 ; if y i  X  X  1 x T x i  X  b r 1 ; if y i  X  1 (
For the non-separable case x T u  X  x i  X  X  b Z  X  1 ; if y i  X  X  1 x T u  X  x i  X  X  b r 1 ; if y i  X  1 (
In this space, a linear decision surface is constructed with special properties that ensure high generalization ability of the network. By use of a nonlinear kernel function, it is possible to compute a separating hyper-plane with a maximum margin in a feature space.

We need to find, among all hyper-planes separating the data, an existing maximum margin 2 = 99 x 99 between the classes. The problem is transformed into a quadratic programming problem min 1 2 x T x  X  C s : t y  X  x T u  X  x i  X  X  b  X  X  1 f i ; f i Z 0 ; i  X  1 ; ... ; l where C is the trade-off parameter between the error and margin. The quadratic programming problem can be solved by using
Kuhn X  X ucker (KKT) conditions. The x can be recovered by using  X  vectors (SV).

The decision boundary is determined only by the SV. Let t rewrite.  X

RBF, and MLP, can be used within the SVM. This finally results in the following: y  X  x  X  X  sgn
In addition to linear classification, SVM can be applied to nonlinear classification problems. When applying SVM in non-linear problems, nonlinear mapping is used to generate the classification features from the original data. The nonlinearly separable data to be classified is mapped onto a high-dimensional feature space, where the data can be linearly classified (Vapnik, 1998). noisy image is formed by its spatial regularity.

One of the many advantages of the wavelet transform over other mathematical transformations is the retention of the spatial relationship between pixels in the original image by the coefficients in the wavelet domain. These spatial relationships represent features of the image and should be retained as much as possible during denoising. In general, images are comprised of regular features, and the resulting wavelet transform of an image generates few large, spatially contiguous coefficients, which are representative of the features given in the original image. We refer to the spatial contiguity of the wavelet coefficients as spatial regularity.

The concept of spatial regularity has the similar meaning as that of signal regularity in previous denoising approaches for selecting the wavelet coefficients. The key difference is that wavelet coefficients rather than statistical models such as Markov random sequences or (H  X  older) exponents in previous methods (Motwani and Gadiya, 2004) . These models are often computa-tionally complicated and still do not reflect the geometry of the features explicitly. As a result, the current method has a better performance even with a much simpler computation.

Because of spatial regularity, the resulting subbands of the wavelet transform do not generally contain isolated coefficients. This regularity can aid in deciding which coefficients should be selected for reconstruction, and which should be thrown away for maximum reconstructed image quality. The proposed coefficient selection method in which spatial regularity is exploited is shown as follows.

The first step for selecting the wavelet coefficient is to form a preliminary binary label for each wavelet coefficient, which collectively form a binary map. The binary map is then used to determine whether or not a particular wavelet coefficient is included in a regular spatial feature. The wavelet transform of f used to create the preliminary binary map I  X  x ; y I  X  x ; y  X  where t is a threshold for selecting valid wavelet coefficients in the construction of the binary wavelet coefficient map. A valid wavelet coefficient is defined as a wavelet coefficient C been selected due to its magnitude. After wavelet coefficients are selected by magnitude, spatial regularity is used to further examine the role of the valid wavelet coefficient: whether it is isolated noise or part of a spatial feature. The number of supporting binary values around a particular non-zero value spatially connected to I  X  x ; y .

A wavelet coefficient is spatially connected to another if there exists a continuous path of valid wavelet coefficients between the two. Fig. 2 b gives a generic wavelet coefficient map. The valid support any other valid wavelet coefficients in the wavelet coefficient map. However, wavelet coefficients C D and C F support coefficients given in Fig. 2 b.

Below, we summarize the steps taken by the proposed wavelet-based image-denoising algorithm using LS-SVM. (1) Perform a J level discrete wavelet transform (DWT) on the noisy image, and obtain a lowpass subband A 1 and a series of highpass subbands D 1 ; D 2 ; ... ; D 3 J . the high-frequency subband D k , we firstly compute the then, N k wavelet coefficients with the max support value are selected as the feature vector F 1 k ,and N k wavelet coefficients with the support value 0 are randomly selected as the feature ing to the selected wavelet coefficients is regarded as the
Here, N k is the max support value max high-frequency subband D k . ... ; 3 J ). So, the LS-SVM model can be obtained by training. (4) Classify the wavelet coefficients in high-frequency subband
D all high-frequency wavelet coefficients are classified into noisy coefficients and noise-free ones. Here, the wavelet coefficient is noise-free coefficient when the actual output is 1, and the wavelet coefficient is noisy coefficient when the actual output is 0. 26 28 30 32 34 36 PSNR (dB) 20 22 24 26 28 30 PSNR (dB) 256 256), 8-bit grayscale geometric image (size 512 512), and standard 24-bit true color image such as Barbara (size 512 512), corrupted by simulated additive Gaussian white noise with a standard deviation equal to 10,20,30,50. Several methods were used to filter the noisy image. multiresolution-based grayscale denoiser we know of. It consists of a multivariate thresholding-integrating both inter-and intrascale dependencies-performed in a highly redundant (eight orientations per scale) full steerable pyramid. (2) Luisier et al.

From the training samples, we find that the relationship between first-order polynomial to represent t and use the most popular linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) method to find the parameter associated with the polynomial. For the first-order polynomial, two parameters a and b are found such that  X  a s  X  b The choice of a and b will minimize the MSE between t e and t .

In a wavelet-based denoising scenario, color RGB images are generally mapped into the YUV space, and each YUV band is then filtered independently from the others. The goal here to see whether our method would give improved results. Fig. 6 displays the reconstructed images using ProbShrink-MB (Pizurica and detail of the original image and helps the reader observe the qualitative differences between the different methods. As the figures show, our method offers a better recovery of edge information relative to ProbShrink-MB (Pizurica and Philips, 2006) and SUREbivariate (Luisier et al., 2007) . In addition, our method outputs images that are visually more pleasant.
According to Figs. 4 X 6 , we see that the visual quality of restored images by the proposed method is competitive with the other tested methods. From the tabular results, it can be observed that the proposed image donoising can restore images with smaller relative errors and higher output PSNR values. The effectiveness of the proposed image-denoising method results from using the wavelet transform with LS-SVM, and in which the our denoised images is moreover characterized by fewer artifacts than the other methods.
