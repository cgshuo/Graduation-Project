 Federica Cavicchio 1 Overview  X  X  X andling emotions in human X  X omputer dialogues X  X , written by Pittermann, Pittermann and Minker, is a complete and interesting book about affective computing in spoken dialogue systems. Dialogue systems are an integrated part of our daily life. They generally mean simplicity, time saving and safety. For example, when driving, hand-free operations are necessary and therefore the possibility of giving commands through speech is a necessity. However, to implement more flexible dialogue systems, it is important that these systems can adapt to the speaker. In particular, it seems very important that dialogue systems should be able to recognize and cope with our emotions. To human, the emotions recognition process occurs in an automatic, unconscious, and effortless fashion. Emotions explicitly affect our autonomic nervous system (e.g., cardiovascular and skin conductance changes) and our somatic nervous system (motor expression in face, voice and body). We usually don X  X  have many problems in decoding the others X  emotions, though the mechanisms of emotion decoding and of empathy are still unclear.
In the last years a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to the detection of speakers X  emotive state from speech. A large number of studies establishes prosodic and lexical cues to detect the emotive state of the speakers. In this book the authors propose a novel approach combining emotive keywords recognition and classification of prosodic features extracted from the speech signal. A hybrid model integrating emotions in an adaptive dialogue management system is implemented. Finally, an evaluation of the dialogue manager system is presented.
 2 Summary In the Introduction chapter the authors sketch out the architecture of Spoken Language Dialogue Systems, described as  X  X  X he most natural, convenient and inexpensive way of communication X  X  (Preface, p. V) between humans and machines. They also review the challenges and the open issues regarding the management of the dialogue flow, the user modeling and dialogue systems evaluation. The development of the dialogue management system and the modeling of the user behavior are both key factors for the robustness and the success of the interaction. In addition, before the system is ready to be put into operation, it must be evaluated to ensure it suits the users X  needs.

In the second chapter, emotion theories are reviewed. A very important question the authors address is about the emotion labeling mechanism. Different languages differ with respect to the emotion vocabulary. Furthermore, the nature and the origin of the differences between the semantic fields of emotion terms in different languages is still an open question. Russell and Barrett ( 1999 ) claim that it is possible to investigate psychological  X  X  X rimitive X  X  of the affective feeling called  X  X  X ore affect X  X . The  X  X  X rimitive X  X  is a point in a low dimensional valence/arousal space and is the basis for the construction of a specific emotion category. On the contrary, the appraisal theorists deny the existence of such well-defined categories and consider emotive terminology a part of the dynamic representation of an emotion (Frijda 1986 , 2009 ; Scherer 2009 ). Pittermann, Pittermann and Minker also review some emotional speech corpora. As regards the selection of features and classifiers for speech-based emotion recognition, a large amount of work has already been done. There is a large variety of emotion recognizer with their own particular kind of unique features and performances. As a consequence, emotion recognizers are very difficult to compare.

Chapters 3 and 4 describe the dialogue managing system. Particularly, in the third chapter the authors focus on several approaches testing how information provided by an emotion recognizer can be processed to adapt to human X  X omputer dialogues. The authors X  first consideration is that humans interacting with machines behave differently from when interacting with another human being. The idea of adapting dialogues flow to ensure an efficient human X  X omputer interaction come from the work of Ukelson and Rodeh ( 1989 ). In this seminal paper, Ukelson and Rodeh X  X  aim is having an efficient interaction in terms of minimal number of questions to reach the information needed. In Ukelson and Rodeh X  X  view, a dialogue can be represented in a tree-like fashion. More recently, a cognitive modular approach has been applied to human X  X omputer dialogues. In this view, dialogue management systems are based on speech acts and include a reasoning module and a knowledge base with application description, grammar dialogue history etc. So, when the system asks for information, the reasoning module would pick up the right answer from the knowledge base. Other dialogue systems use a mixed model with a tree-shaped dialogue control model where statistical language models are trained with the aid of a user simulator. Emotions are integrated in the dialogue management as numerical values. The approach chosen by the authors is to consider a two-dimensional vector containing numerical values for both valence and arousal. Each emotional state is described with 2 numbers ranging from -1to ? 1. Therefore, a neutral state is (0, 0) while happiness, featuring a high valence and a high arousal is situated around (0.9, 0.8). The major drawback of this approach to emotion is that the developers must set up an enormous number of parameters to accommodate the dialogue flow. To solve this problem, the authors propose a semi-stochastic approach integrating a predefined set of dialogue states and rules with a stochastic model describing the transitions between the emotive states. In chapter 4 the authors X  speech based approach to emotion recognition is described. They train their system on the Berlin Emotion database, a large speech corpus collecting utterances generated by actors, in the six basic emotions. A phonetic and prosodic classification for speech recognition is combined with a prosodic and acoustic features extraction for the emotion classification. The acoustic model consists of a Hidden Markov Model. In this model each node represents one phoneme in one emotional state. As a consequence the complexity of the acoustic model grows linearly with the number of emotions to be recognized. This leads in turn to a bigger model complexity and lower emotion recognition. Therefore, to classify the emotive state of an utterance, the authors take into account the textual content too. They compile a keyword dictionary in which to each word (e.g., awful , cool , ridiculous ) or  X  X  X ffective X  X  burst (e.g., wow , yawn , yuk ) a positive ( ? 1), neutral (0) or negative ( -1) valence is attributed. When more than a word or affective burst is present in an utterance, the sum of the valence values is attributed to the utterance. Unfortunately, explicitly emotional keywords are rare in the utterances. But in combination with the phonetic emotion recognizer they seem useful to detect emotive states.

In chapter 5 the authors test several approaches to improve the emotion and emotive speech recognition. Following Campbell ( 2004 ), to optimize the emotion recognition, it is important to label the data with the emotion they express. The first level of labeling is attributing an emotion to the whole utterance. The second step is the detection of speech pauses. A third stage is to label each word with an emotion. The fourth and last phase is labeling every phoneme in the utterance with the emotion they express. Another approach to improve the emotions recognition is a reduction of the emotion set. This improves automatically the recognizer performance. Taking into account that in application such as a call center an emotion as disgust will not be encountered frequently, the authors decide to discard that label. Moreover, they change all the utterances previously labeled as expressing boredom with a neutral label as the acoustic and prosodic difference between the two emotions is difficult to disentangle. Another optimization they introduce is the distinction between female and male speakers expressing emotions, as the acoustic realizations are different. The authors call  X  X  X mophonemes X  X  the phonemes labeled with an emotion and the speaker X  X  gender. To allow the recognizers to become more robust, recognition of speech and of emotion are separated. Thus, the recognizer uses two distinct recognition networks. This seems the best option as in speech recognizers errors occur stochastically. A multiple recognition system taking into account multiple speech error is the ROVER system (Recognizer Output Voting Error Reduction; Fiscus 1997 ). The authors decide to use ROVER to implement both speech and emotion recognition.

In chapter 6 the authors evaluate their recognition system. The criteria to evaluate emotion recognition are often inconsistent, hence the difficulty to compare different classification methods. The authors run a huge number of simulations with different feature sets and recognizer setups. They obtain excellent recognition scores for word accuracy (between 82 and 89%) and emotion accuracy (between 76 and 89%) with the adapted ROVER method. Among the many experiments, these results show the more promising improvements in the recognition rate. Nevertheless, the use of multiple recognizer systems introduces enormous complexity in a Spoken Language Dialogue. User studies on the authors X  system show a high user-friendliness and user acceptability with respect to standard dialogue systems.

In the Conclusion the authors draw some future directions for their research. The first is the implementation of a stochastic recognizer for the emotion labeling. Furthermore, the authors say that more attention should be paid in the future to the combination of linguistic and paralinguistic cues, especially when that combination would be useful to widen the emotions recognizer performances and to avoid combination categories such as the neutral-boredom category. To do so, the authors plan to focus on a single emotion such as anger or fear (both of which are respectively frequent emotions in telephone and emergency call centers) or to detect only the emotion valence: neutral, positive or negative. 3 Evaluation Currently, recognition and classification of emotions are hot topics in human X  computer interaction studies.  X  X  X andling emotions in human X  X omputer dialogues X  X  is an interesting and valuable contribution to the NLP community. It offers an interesting and multidisciplinary view of spoken dialogue systems and emotions.
However, the way Pittermann, Pittermann and Minker categorize the emotion raises some doubts. In fact, many of the recognizer flows might be due to their database the authors use to train the model.

The Berlin Emotion database is a corpus produced by actors. In the last two decades, the emotive vocal expressions produced by professional or semi professional actors have been considered the  X  X  X olden standard X  X  for studying emotions. This is not completely true, as each actor X  X  production should be validated assessing the real closeness to the  X  X  X tandard X  X  emotion representation with the one that a group of annotators has in mind. Also, reliability test should be run on data annotation to avoid annotators X  agreement due to chance. The lack of such an analysis on the Berlin Emotion database material can be accounted for the difficulty the authors find in distinguishing between neutral and bored utterances. The discrete categories the authors X  use to label the emotions raise some questions as well. Emotions are dynamic rather than static events. They are driven by the results of sequential appraisal checks. In this view, emotions expressed by the face and the voice are not  X  X  X eadout X  X  of motor programs but indicators of mental states and evaluation of the communicative situations. Nevertheless, the book offers a complete and up-to-date view of the emotion recognition problems and some interesting insights on how to solve them. For those reasons  X  X  X andling emotions in human X  X omputer dialogues X  X  is an excellent book both for experts and for readers who want to specialize within the area of affective spoken dialogue systems.
