Contemporary search engines are optimized for look-up scenarios where the information target is well-defined and hu-man X  X achine interaction is limited to queries and search-result selections. In this role the search system serves as a cog-nitive prosthetic, temporarily enhancing people X  X  mental capabilities to provide access to additional information not known to the searcher or not readily accessible to them. However, this type of support is insufficient for tasks requiring more in-volved information interaction (e.g., where cross-query learning may be important) and situations where information behavior encompasses more than just information seeking . People may often possess more aspirational goals such as aug-menting their intellect ( Engelbart, 1962 ) and applying their knowledge to explore, learn, and make sense of the information they encounter ( Marchionini, 2006a ). To meet these demands search systems need to form a symbiotic relationship with their users, providing support for fluid and meaningful interaction between human and machine, and promoting critical thinking and increased interaction with information to facilitate cognitive development.

Human X  X omputer information retrieval (HCIR) is the study of methods that integrate human intelligence and algorithmic search to help people better search, explore, learn from, and leverage information ( Marchionini, 2006b ). It comprises a num-ber of sub-disciplines including exploratory search ( White &amp; Roth, 2009 ) which combines querying and browsing strategies to foster learning and investigation; information retrieval in context ( Ingwersen &amp; J X rvelin, 2005 ) which considers aspects of the user or environment that are typically not reflected in query statements; and interactive information retrieval (IIR), which is primarily focused on the interactive communication processes between the main actors in retrieval operations: users, systems, and optionally, intermediaries ( Ingwersen, 1992 ). All of these sub-disciplines share a common goal: under-standing and improving the way that people leverage technology to derive value from information. HCIR affords searchers self-actualization, deep involvement in the search process, and predominant roles in system design, use, and evaluation.
Over the past few decades, search behavior has converged on a small number of tactics that transform the user into a passive information receiver rather than an active information seeker ( Allan et al., 2012 ). HCIR systems empower searchers to be more proactive, critical thinkers during the information search process. To achieve this they must help users acquire better information search skills (through tutorials, tips, etc. ( Bateman, Teevan, &amp; White, 2012; Moraveji, Russell, &amp; Mease, 2011 )) and provide better system support for information interaction and understanding. Marchionini (2006b) proposed the following design goals for search systems where users have more control in determining relevant results: (i) help people making sense of information (cf. Dervin, 1998 ); (ii) amplify and reward good intellectual effort; (iii) have flexible architec-tures; (iv) situate themselves within a broader information ecology of memories and tools; (v) support the information life-cycle from creation to use; (vi) support tuning by users, and (vii) should be engaging and enjoyable to use. By realizing many of these goals, HCIR systems can help people become more effective information seekers and consumers, and more informed individuals generally.

Existing capabilities of search systems already provide some support for the objectives listed above. Beyond presenting a ranked list of search results chosen with respect to the provided query, features such as spelling suggestions and suggested queries provide mechanisms to lead the user to potentially relevant content. Importantly from an HCIR perspective, control over selection and interpretation of the suggestions offered still remains with the searcher. Systems are also becoming increasingly aware of their users and their situations that extend beyond the query statements they issue. Personalization employs user models to individualize search results to a particular user X  X  interests ( Teevan, Dumais, &amp; Horvitz, 2005 ). Rel-evance feedback (including implicit feedback from interaction behavior and biometrics from physiological sensors) enables search systems to develop richer representations of users X  tasks and search interests by capturing relevance judgments explicitly from searchers ( Rocchio, 1971 ) or mining them from their search interactions ( Kelly &amp; Teevan, 2003 ) or physio-logical signals ( Feild, Allan, &amp; Jones, 2010 ). The search behavior of other users (primarily queries and clickthrough) can also be mined in the aggregate and used to help rank results ( Agichtein, Brill, &amp; Dumais, 2006; Joachims, 2002 ) or suggest paths to follow through document collections ( Wexelblat &amp; Maes, 1999; White, Bilenko, &amp; Cucerzan 2007 ). Recent research on mining finer-grained search interactions, such as mouse movements to estimate searcher X  X  gaze attention, is a promising direction for richer behavioral modeling on the Web ( Guo &amp; Agichtein, 2010; Huang, White, &amp; Dumais, 2011 ). The application of information to garner insights and make decisions is another important requirement of HCIR systems.
Information visualization, visual analytics, summarization, and collaboration methods help users make meaning from the results returned for a query. Beyond better ranking and query formulation support, search systems can also provide task-appropriate forms of data display ( Shneiderman, Byrd, &amp; Croft, 1997 ) that allow users to explore, analyze and synthesize information, and interact and engage with information in more meaningful ways, amplifying cognitive capabilities ( Card,
Mackinlay, &amp; Shneiderman, 1999 ). Summarization helps aggregate or compress search results into a more human-consum-able form. Faceted search ( Tunkelang, 2009 ) is one such form of summarization that enables users to navigate information hierarchically, transitioning from a category to its sub-categories, but choosing the order in which the categories are exam-ined. Faceted navigation ( Hearst, 2009 ), like taxonomic navigation, guides users by showing them available categories (or facets), but does not require them to browse through hierarchies that may not reflect their search intentions or map well to how they want to explore the data. Another summarization method is search-result clustering ( Salton, 1971 ), which groups similar or co-occurring documents or terms allowing for analysis of the clusters themselves (which can be informa-tive in their own right) or use the clusters as a way to refine the search space. The output of summarization or analytics may be displayed as tables, charts, or summaries of aggregated data such as TreeMaps ( Shneiderman, 1992 ) which may be up-dated dynamically based on users X  manipulation of provided control mechanisms ( Ahlberg &amp; Shneiderman, 1994 ). Searchers may also seek answers from other searchers either as part of a collaborative search task ( Morris &amp; Horvitz, 2007 ) or in ques-tion-and-answer (Q&amp;A) scenarios where questions are posed broadly to online communities such as Yahoo! Answers (an-swers.yahoo.com) or to a group of knowledgeable (expert) answerers via a more focused medium such as instant messaging ( Horowitz &amp; Kamvar, 2010 ).

In addition to providing enhanced system support, HCIR systems need to be evaluated in a way that reflects the require-ments of their users. Most modern IR systems employ a ranked retrieval model, in which the documents are scored based on estimates of document relevance to a query. These systems are typically evaluated based on their performance over a set of benchmark queries in settings such as the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) ( Harman, 1993 ). Because of its emphasis on the role of human intelligence in the search process, HCIR requires different evaluation models. Early work on interactive IR leverages standard measures such as precision and recall but applies them to the results of multiple iterations of user inter-action, rather than to a single query response. One example of this is the work of Koenemann and Belkin (1996) , where they examine different levels of transparency in query suggestion. Other HCIR research, such as Borlund X  X  IIR evaluation model, applies a methodology more reminiscent of HCI, focusing on key issues such as the characteristics of users and the details of experimental design ( Borlund, 2003 ). More recent research on the evaluation of HCIR systems has shifted the focus toward the measurement of non-traditional, but nonetheless critical, aspects of the search process such as user engagement ( O X  X rien &amp; Toms, 2010 ), search satisfaction ( Fox, Karnawat, Mydland, Dumais, &amp; White, 2005 ), time-based gain ( Smucker &amp; Clarke, 2012 ), learning as a function of exploration time ( Rao &amp; Card, 1994 ), or the rate of grasping variable properties or inter-var-iable relationships during exploratory data analysis ( Pirolli &amp; Rao, 1996 ). Establishing a set of trusted metrics is critical for the development of effective HCIR systems and we expect to see more of these metrics emerge over time  X  including some that are outlined in this special topic issue.

This special issue makes progress towards more sophisticated modeling of searcher needs, discusses the provision of sup-port to help users, and covers issues in the design and evaluation of HCIR systems. It builds on the increased interest in HCIR, especially in light of the popular HCIR workshop series that has run annually for the past six years in the United States and has recently spawned a European counterpart in the EuroHCIR event. The goals of the special issue are twofold: (i) foster the design of search systems that support complex problem solving, that increase user control and responsibility, that facilitate intellectual development, that support the full information life cycle, and that are engaging and enjoyable to use; and (ii) provide an outlet for significant previously-unpublished research on HCIR. The special issue articles describe complete pieces of work that aim to enhance the community X  X  knowledge of existing search behaviors, demonstrate through sound experimentation how new interactive tools can assist searchers, or propose and validate new evaluation metrics and meth-ods for HCIR scenarios. The collection of articles in this special topic issue covers a range of pertinent topics including explo-ration, engagement, task effects, inferring knowledge from behavior, information visualization and collaborative search.
The acquisition of information and the search interaction process is influenced strongly by a person X  X  use of their knowl-edge of the domain and the task. Two of the accepted articles in this special topic issue specifically focus on searcher knowl-edge. In Examining Users X  Knowledge Change in the Task Completion Process Jingjing Liu and colleagues describe a study of changes in searchers X  topic knowledge as they attempt search tasks. They studied knowledge changes over time (across three search sessions) and demonstrated that users X  knowledge generally increases after each search session. They also found that knowledge was correlated with participants X  perceptions of task attributes and accomplishment, and that task type affects several aspects of knowledge levels and knowledge change. In Inferring User Knowledge Level from Eye Movement
Patterns , Michael Cole and colleagues also address the challenge of modeling user knowledge. They present an approach to infer domain knowledge by modeling a user X  X  information acquisition process during search using only measurements of eye movement patterns. They performed a user study in the genomics domain where they compared participants X  self-ratings of domain knowledge with measures of cognitive effort associated with reading patterns during search tasks. The authors con-structed exploratory regression models capable of predicting knowledge levels based on real-time measurements of eye movement patterns during a task session. The results show correlations between the cognitive effort due to reading and an individual X  X  level of domain knowledge.
Accurately measuring the effect of search systems on user perceptions is essential for improving existing HCIR systems and developing new systems. In Measuring Engagement in Search Systems using the User Engagement Scale , Heather O X  X rien and Elaine Toms present methods to measure the user experience during search, specifically focusing on user engagement.
They propose an experimental instrument, the user engagement scale (UES), that measures the user experience more com-prehensively than only satisfaction, allowing for the capture of dynamic, multifaceted experiences that evoke pragmatic and hedonic needs, expectations, and outcomes associated with exploratory search. The UES captures six factors, including sub-scales pertaining to usability, aesthetics, and attention. To perform rigorous reliability and validity testing of the UES, the authors ran a laboratory study with a large number of participants performing complex search tasks on a new search inter-face. They present findings from their analysis of the scale X  X  performance and showed that the some of the sub-scales were stable and others could be merged to form a single factor. In A Cross-Domain Analysis of Task and Genre Effects on Perceptions of Usefulness , Luanne Freund presents the findings of two studies of an approach to identify more useful documents through the relationships between searchers X  tasks and document genres. This research makes progress towards developing search systems that can distinguish between information that is on topic and information that is useful, i.e., suitable and applicable to the task at hand. Freund describes a questionnaire and a user study conducted in two domains that provide evidence that perceptions of usefulness are dependent upon information task type, document genre, and the relationship between these two factors. Aligned with the studies on user knowledge described earlier, Freund also shows that people X  X  domain knowl-edge affects their perceptions of usefulness.

As well as measuring aspects of the search process, HCIR is very much focused on the development of new systems to help people search and learn more effectively. In CIDER: Concept-based Image Diversification, Exploration, and Retrieval , Orland
Hoeber and colleagues describe support for image search that first performs automatic query expansion using Wikipedia as the source knowledge base, and then organizes the diverse search results using both conceptual information associated with each image, and visual features extracted from the images. This, coupled with a hierarchical organization of the concepts, provides an interactive interface that takes advantage of searchers X  abilities to recognize relevant concepts, filter and focus the search results based on these concepts, and visually identify relevant images while navigating within the image space.
The authors outline the key features of their system, and present the results of a preliminary user study that demonstrates its potential benefits to searchers conducting image retrieval tasks. In Adaptive Visualization for Exploratory Information Re-trieval , Jae-wook Ahn and Peter Brusilovsky propose the incorporation of interactive visualization into personalized search and introduce an adaptive-visualization-based search system. The system aims to enhance the effectiveness of personaliza-tion by supporting search interaction and promoting learning about the problem at hand. The authors evaluate their system in a user study and show that it can improve the precision and the productivity of personalized search while helping users discover more diverse sets of information.

Moving beyond the individual searcher, collaboration is an important aspect of human-centered IR. In Let X  X  Search To-gether, But Not Too Close! An Analysis of Communication and Performance in Collaborative Information Seeking , Roberto Gon-z X lez-Ib X  X ez and colleagues investigate different types of communication channels used by information seekers on a collaborative project. They describe a user study with 30 pairs (60 participants) in three different conditions: co-located, re-motely located with text chat, and remotely located with text as well as audio chat, in an exploratory search task. They show that pairs of collaborators who are remotely-located were more effective at exploring diverse information, and that adding audio support for remote collaboration helped participants to lower both their cognitive load as well as negative emotions compared to those working in the same space. The authors also show how these findings could lead to the design of more effective systems for collaborative information seeking tasks using adequate and appropriate communication.

Moving forward, the models of behavior that the HCIR community develops and the systems that they build based on those models should keep pace with technological advances and user demands. Search is expanding into new domains (e.g., leisure, diagnosis, and social) and how people are interacting with information is fundamentally changing ( Hearst, 2011 ). New modalities (e.g., natural user interaction such as multi-touch on tablets and smartphones, gestural interactions, speech input and output, augmented reality), different form factors (e.g., smartphones, laptops, tablets, immersive search and exploration environments), and are handling a broader range of tasks than ever before. Big data is also emerging as a critical component of current and future search systems, both in terms of searching new data sources (e.g., statistics, multi-media, sensor streams) and leveraging new types of data (e.g., search logs and social network graphs) to improve search per-formance and offer recommendations based on the aggregated behavior of other users. Earlier we pointed to some ways in which data can be helpful in directing users toward potentially-relevant results. However, there is still significant opportu-nity for searchers to learn from the activities of the masses or particular subsets with shared interests or more domain knowledge (e.g., subject matter experts).

The coming years will bring a revolution in the design of search technology driven by new capabilities (such as those highlighted above) but also a shift in people X  X  expectations for the support that search technology should provide to them.
Beyond simply finding information, more focus will be placed on enhanced capabilities to empower people to search more effectively, efficiently solve complete search tasks (not just single queries), and facilitate their cognitive development. We envisage that HCIR research, such as that presented in this special issue, will be central to this change and will play a pivotal role in creating the enlightened society that could follow.
