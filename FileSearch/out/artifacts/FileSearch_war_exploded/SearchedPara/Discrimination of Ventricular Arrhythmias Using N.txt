 Classifying cardiac arrhythmias using the elect rocardiogram (ECG) is in great need of Fuzzy neural networks (FNN) can be effectively used for this type of tool as a major abnormal behavior, the Filtering Transforms (FT) as filtering process is needed. The Fibrillation (VF), the most dangerous type of heart arrhythmia. The VF is represented by fast rhythm, abnormal and ineffective contractions of the ventricles and it finishes death. The survival probability for a human who has a VF attack outside the hospital ranges between 2-25% [14]. neural network with weighted membership functions (NEWFM) and the non-overlap area distribution measurement method [5]. The method extracts minimum number of input features each of which constructs an interpretable fuzzy membership function. including direct, transformation, and characteristic parameter estimation methods. FT Base method for detecting arrhythmias classification. This study has quondam that no decision can be reached for the interval.)[3], so the recalculated accuracy rates counted of NSR, VF, and VT are 82.5 %, 58 %, and 62.5 %, respectively. 
In this paper, the 15 generalized features from 19 PDF features are selected by non-neural network weighted fuzzy membership functions (NEWFM) [6][5]. The 15 features are interpretably formed in wei ghted fuzzy membership functions preserving of ECG patterns. Although reducing the number of features is advantageous to dependency on data sets or patients. 2.1 Filtering Transformation transformation process contained a filtering function file. The filtering function works in four steps as follows: A. Remove the average value of the signal from the signal. B. Apply a moving averaging filter in order to remove high frequency noise. produced by the heart and originate from external sources. D. Make a butterworth filter with a remove frequency of 30 Hz eliminates frequencies higher than 30 Hz, which seem to be of no relevance in our simulations. By defibrillator is reasonably simulated. 2.2 Probability Density Function (PDF) Transformation This PDF process is based on sampling the amplitude distribution of the same baseline cardiac rhythm signal. The distinct NSR, VT, and VF rhythm signal probability density curve has been shown in Fig.1. There are eight ranges in Y coordinate of the curve like every interval of the eight ranges are counted and then the every interval's average of some tests and are used as the NEWFM input data. 3.1 The Structure of NEWFM Neural network with weighted fuzzy membership function (NEWFM) is a supervised classification neuro-fuzzy system using bounded sum of weighted fuzzy membership contains n input nodes for an n featured input pattern. The hyperbox layer consists of m hyperbox nodes. Each hyperbox node B l to be connected to a class node contains n class node is connected to one or more hyperbox nodes. An h -th input pattern can be and A h is n features of an input pattern. winner for an input I h with class i and w li = 1. 3.2 Learning Scheme has three weighted fuzzy membership functions (WFM, grey triangles in Fig. 3) which randomly constructed before learning. Each the original membership function denoted as (.) i an input pattern A h for i features to the hyperbox B l , output of the B l is obtained by formulas (2) membership function weight strength of . of Adjust ( B l ) operation, the vertices the following expressions: where the  X  and  X  are the learning rates for from 0 to 1 and j=1,2,3. 
Fig. 4 shows BSWFMs before and after Adjust ( B l ) operation for i a . The weights and the centers of membership functions are adjusted by the Adjust ( B ) operation, e.g., toward a i , and scheme with Adjust( B l ) operation is repeated from the beginning by randomly the goal rate is reached. are used to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed NEWFM. The 15 generalized features among 19 generalized features are selected by non-overlap area measurement method [4]. The analyzed data set is taken from MIT/BIH Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmia second samples of each NSR, VT, and VF episodes in the 22 records are selected at random. Fig. 5 shows BSWFMs of the generalized 6 features among the generalized 15 features. The solid lines, broken lines and dotted lines represent NSR, VF, and VT characteristics of ECG visually, which enables the features to interpret explicitly. 
Chowdhury has quondam accuracy rates of NSR, VF, and VT is 94.3 %, 78.0 %, and 82 %, respectively. But this result doesn X  X  count the classification CT decision (the respectively. Table 1 shows the recalculated accuracy rates. The average accuracy rate is 67.5%. 
Table 2 shows the performance results of NEWFM using the generalized 15 features. In this paper, there is no CT decision. NEWFM classifies NSR, VF, and VT on all data sets. The accuracy rates of NSR, VF, and VT are 98.75 %, 76.25 %, and 63.75 %, respectively and the average accuracy rate is 79.16%. The BSWFMs of the 15 features trained by NEWFM are shown visually, which makes the features interpret explicitly. Since each BSWFM combines multiple weighted fuzzy membership functions into one using bounded sum, the 15 small-Defibrillators (AED). To improve the accuracy rates of NSR, VF, and VT, some kinds of mathematics X  method instead of PDF will be needed to study in real application of AED. On the other hand, some good results are achieved on economy index and stock forecasting which using NEWFM.
