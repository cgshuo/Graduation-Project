Algorithms, Experimentation Plagiarism Detection, Plagiarism Detection Systems, Citation-based Plagiarism Detecti on, Cross Language, Text Reuse State-of-the-art plagiarism detection approaches capably identify copy &amp; paste and to some extent slightly modified plagiarism. However, they cannot reliably identify strongly disguised plagiarism forms, including paraphrases, translated plagiarism, and idea plagiarism, which are forms of plagiarism more commonly found in scientific te xts. This weakness of current systems results in a large fraction of today X  X  scientific plagiarism going undetected. Prof. Weber-Wulff, the organizer of a regular performance evaluation of Plagiarism Detection Systems (PDS), gives a disillusioning summary regarding available systems: and  X  [...] for translations or heavily edited material, the systems While undisguised copy &amp; paste-ty pe plagiarism is software-recognizable and typically occurs in student essays where it has no serious consequences for societ y, a different story holds for disguised scientific plagiarism, which is currently non-recognizable. Plagiarized medical and pharmaceutical studies can jeopardize the safe treatment of patients when not based on original research. To address this problem, we proposed Citation-based Plagiarism Detection (CbPD) [2]. Compared to existing approaches, CbPD does not consider textual similarity alone, but uses the citation patterns within scientific documents as a unique, language-independent fingerprint to id entify semantic similarity. Evaluations of real-world plag iarism cases have shown that plagiarists commonly disgui se academic misconduct by paraphrasing copied text, but usually do not substitute or rearrange the citations copied from the source document. Motivated by these findings, we developed several CbPD algorithms; each tailored to a specific form of disguised plagiarism. We implemented the algorithms in a first citation-based plagiarism detection protot ype capable of detecting strongly disguised plagiarism, even when no textual similarity remains. We first demonstrated the advantages of the developed CbPD approach in evaluations using the plagiarized thesis of former German defense minister Karl -Theodor zu Guttenberg. While conventional detecti on approaches could not identify a single instance of translated plagiarism in the thesis, the novel approach detected 13 of the 16 translated plagiarisms present [2]. We used the bioscience full-text collection PubMed Central Open Access Subset (PMC OAS), which incl udes 200,000 publications, to demonstrate the practicability of the CbPD approach on a large corpus [4]. We machine parsed the citations (in text) and references (in bibliography) of documents in the PMC OAS and computed the citation-based similarities between all possible document pairs using each of the CbPD algorithms. The result is a database, which contains about 7 million references, 11 million citations and 750 million citation patterns. The database is the backbone of the presented protot ype, which is available under www.citeplag.org. Besides the 200,000 publications from the PMC OAS, the prototype also allows inspection of the plagiarized thesis of former German defe nse minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg. The screenshot in Figure 1: Scr eenshot of CbPD prototype (left plagiarized translation, right source document) shows an excerpt from this thesis on the left and the corresponding text from the English source document on the ri ght. The source document is an interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, which is translated nearly word-for-word, creating a plagiari sm spanning 21 pages. Despite plagiarism, aside from four correctly cited longer quotes. Only upon visualizing citation patterns using CbPD does the disguised plagiarism become obvious (Figure 1). As a raw measure of global docum ent similarity, we include the Bibliographic Coupling (BC) score, a simple measure of the absolute number of shared referen ces in the bibliographies of two documents, in our assessment . However, since BC does not consider the placement of citations in a document X  X  full-text, we developed three  X  X ine-tuned X  algorithms which make up the core of the CbPD approach: Citation Chunking (CC), Greedy Citation Tiling (GCT) and Longest Comm on Citation Sequence (LCCS). Details on these detection algorithms can be found in this publication [1]. The Citation Chunking set of algorithms identify individual matching citation patterns, termed  X  X itation chunks X . The Citation Chunking algorithms are resilient to slight transpositions of citation order and inserted or deleted citations. The Greedy Citation Tiling algorithms identify sets of matching citations in identical order, whic h we call  X  X itation tiles X . Longest citation pattern matches are iden tified first, subsequently the remaining shorter citation patter n matches are considered for citation tile formation. The Longest Common Citation Sequence represents the maximum number of citations two documents share in identical order, when skipping over the non-matching citations. A document pair has either exactly one LCCS or no shared citations. The CitePlag prototype features a customizable side-by-side document visualization, see mark er 1 Figure 1, to efficiently browse scientific documents for text and citation similarities and aid the user in identifying plagiarism. In this case, the suspicious document is displayed on the left and the source document is displayed on the right. When sele cting the highlighted text or citation similarity in either document, the respective section in the other document is retrieved. The visualization of text and citation similarities is customizable to th e user X  X  preferences in the menu bar under  X  X ettings X , see marker 2 Figure 1. A scrollable central document brow ser, see marker 3 Figure 1, schematically represents the documents to be compared and allows for quick interactive doc ument navigation. The document browser visualizes citation-based similarities according the CbPD algorithm selected, see marker 4 Figure 1. By highlighting matching citations in identical colors and connecting them in the document browser, see Figure 2, the CbPD approach visualizes not only the easy to spot global or copy &amp; paste plagiarism instances, but also local and heavily disguised plagiarism instances , which remain invisible to conventional PDS. The menu bar features document  X  X tatistics X , including graphs showing the sum of character-mat ches and bibliographic coupling strength per page. In a collapsibl e side tab, additional documents with high CbPD similarity scores are listed for comparison. The side tab also allows the user to set weighting coefficients for each of the CbPD algorithms, thus cr eating a hybrid CbPD algorithm with custom emphasis. The sour ce-code is published as open-source under a creative co mmons license 3.0. Using the CbPD approach allowed the identification of previously non-machine-detect able plagiarism cases. As a result, several publications, including a fraudulent medical study have already been retracted. The uncovered pl agiarism can be browsed using the prototype. Nevertheless, the CbPD approach should be viewed as a supplement to existing software-based plagiarism detection methods and not a stand-alone replacement, since the individual strengths of the text-based an d citation-based approaches to plagiarism detection complement ea ch other. The strength of text-based approaches lies in their ability to detect even short instances approach excels when little or no te xtual similarity is present, as in the case of translated and heavily disguised plagiarism.
