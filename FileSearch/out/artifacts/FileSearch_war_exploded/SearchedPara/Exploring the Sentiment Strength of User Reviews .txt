 With the rapid development and wide popularity of e-commerce application and Web 2.0 technology, more and more users express their experiences or sentiments on certain products through channels on Web, such as product websites, review websites, forums or discussion groups. For example, on the website of Amazon 1 , there are a great num-reviews, regardless of positive or negative, not only reflect users X  viewpoints and satis-faction levels, but also have a great impact on other consumers X  purchasing behaviors. Hence, sentiment analysis and mining [1] has become an important research issue which benefits manufacturers and managers to obtain users X  opinions on their products, as well as other potential customers to make proper decisions. 
There have already been extensive studies on sentiment analysis over the past few years [1-6, 9-17]. Most of them can be classified into the following two sub-tasks: (a) features extraction, which aims to extract features of products from reviews. These products, thus they are frequently commented and rated by users; and (b) sentiment classification, which focuses on determining the semantic orientation (usually three sentiments for each feature with the same polarity might have different sentiment strength reflecting different emotional intensity of users to the products or services. For  X  This is the most excellent book I have ever read. I love it very much.  X  and the other both express a positive assessment to the book, the sentiment intensity they convey is different. One can clearly feel that the first one reveals a stronger opinion than the sec-ond one from the evidence of the different strengths of adjective word  X  excellent  X  and  X  good  X . In spite of lots of existing works on positive and negative sentiment classifica-tion, few works were done on exploring the strength of user reviews. It is a new chal-lenging task in opinion mining and sentiment analysis. 
In this paper, we propose an approach to assessing the sentiment strength of user words (words expressing users X  positive, neutral or negative opinion) people used when commenting a product. For the above examples,  X  X ost excellent X  and  X  X ood X  are the opinion words. Considering that opinion words are mostly composed of adjec-tives, we measure the sentiment strength according to the strength of adjectives in opinion words. In linguistics, some adverbs (such as  X  X ery X ) are usually used to mod-views scenario. Therefore, the strength of ad verbs is also taken into consideration to accurately measure the sentiment strength. In this paper, we manually mark the strengths of a few frequently used adverbs with values ranging from -1 to +1 based on our intuitions. The strength of adjectives is calculated by a link analysis method based adjective and the directed edge between nodes is a kind of progressive relationship obtained through the search engine based on heuristic rules. We apply the proposed approach on a dataset consisting of hotel comments in Chinese in our experiment, and estimation 2 ). Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective for sentiment classification and achieves a good performance on the five-scale evaluation. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly introduce re-lated works on opinion mining and sentiment analysis. In Section 3, we give a detailed description of our approach to assessing review X  X  sentiment strength. The proposed results is provided in this section. Finally, we draw the conclusion in Section 5. Feature extraction and sentiment classification are two major tasks in the field of opin-ion mining and sentiment analysis. Specifically, feature extraction aims to identify their comments. Sentiment classification investigates methods to classify each review section, we will briefly introduce the related works from the above two aspects. 2.1 Opinion Features Extraction In customers X  reviews, people express their sentiments on certain products by com-menting the opinion features of products based on personal experiences. Therefore, extracting opinion features from review text is the first and an important step in opin-ion mining. It is also the foundation of sentiment classification. 
Turney [2] proposes an algorithm to extract phrases containing adjectives or adverbs which are good indicators of sentiment polarity demonstrated by previous works [3, 4]. He firstly tags the words in review text by a part-of-speech (POS) tagger, and then two consecutive words are extracted from the review text based on pre-defined patterns. the mutual information and classifying the review based on the averaged semantic ori-mental results. Hu and Liu [5, 6] propose another approach to extracting opinion/product features. Their method, which is based on techniques of data mining and natural language processing, is composed of the following steps: (1) A POS Tagging tool is executed quent words or phrases which co-occur in some sentences; (3) Two types of pruning strategies (compactness pruning and redundancy pruning) are used to remove incor-rect features. (4) They extract the opinion noun words from the review text according to the frequent features and the nearby adj ective words. (5) Finally, they also extract some infrequent features which also reflect the attributes of products/services. At the same time, they use synonyms and antonyms in WordNet [8] to determine the senti-ment polarity of words (either positive or negative). Their experiment conducted on customer reviews of electronic products shows that the proposed approach is effective for the opinion features extraction task. 2.2 Sentiment Classification negative (or sometimes neutral). Supervised machine learning methods and unsuper-[9] apply three different machine learning techniques (Na X ve Bayes, Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Machine) to classify movie reviews into positive and negative using various features extracted from reviews. Experimental results show that standard ma-chine learning techniques perform well on sentiment classification. Moreover, from the comparison result of the three machine learning methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieves the best performance, while Na X ve Bayes tends to be the worst one. Cui huge amount of online review data. A conclusion in their experiment is that a classifier combining with high order n-grams features could achieve better performance. Other related work of using machine learning methods for sentiment classification can be found in [11, 12, 13]. Zagibalov and Carroll [14] propose an unsupervised approach, problem of domain-dependency in sentiment classification. The experiment results ob-tained are close to, and sometimes better than those of supervised classifiers. 
Apart from the works of binary sentiment classification, there are also some works performed in terms of assigning the star rating to reviews. In [15], Pang et al. predict the star ratings of movie reviews on a five-scale using a meta-algorithm. Their evalua-tion results show that their method achieves significant improvements over both multi-class and regression of SVM method. Snyder and Barzilay [16] study the re-food, ambience and service, on a five-s cale. Williams and Anand [17] propose a knowledge-based approach to assign each adjective with polarity strength by measur-ing semantic distance between words of known polarity (seed words) and the target word according to WordNet [8], which is the most similar work to ours. However, different from theirs, we use the search engine and progressive rules to find progres-sive relationships between adjectives and measure polarity strength of each adjective based on a link analysis method. NLP-based technique is used to calculate the senti-ment strength of each review. Based on the calculated overall sentiment score, each review is graded with 1 to 5 stars accord ing to the predefined interval division. views in Section 3.1. The calculation of review strength based on the extracted sentiment strength in opinion phrase  X  adjectives and adverbs, are expounded in Section 3.3 and 3.4 respectively. 3.1 Extracting Opinion Phrases from Reviews The sentiment strength of a review is determined by the opinion phrases expressing the opinion holder X  X  sentiment. Extracting the proper opinion phrases from review is the posed in [6] to deal with the opinion phrases extraction as shown in the following steps. (1) The ICTCLAS [18] is used to perform the Chinese words segmentation and (2) Based on the POS tagging result, we pick out all the noun words, and then find (3) For each opinion sentence which contains the opinion noun words, we extract (4) We obtain all the opinion phrases from reviews which consist of the opinion For example, in the customer review  X  This is the most excellent book I have ever the nearby adjective  X  X xcellent X  and the adverb  X  X ost X  which modifies the  X  X xcel-lent X  as the opinion sentiment features. Hence, the opinion phrase here is  X  X ost excel-lent book X . 3.2 Review Strength Calculation After extracting all the opinion phrases from review, the overall sentiment strength of a review R is calculated by averaging the strength of opinion phrases as shown in the following formula (1). the sentiment strength of i th opinion phrase calculated by the product of adverb strength S ( adv i ) and the adjective strength S ( adj i ) as formula (2) described. The value of S ( adv i ) and S ( adj i ) ranges from -1 to +1. Some times, there is no adverb those two determined components will be described in details in the following two subsections. 3.3 Strength of Adjectives To determine the strength of adjective words, we utilize search engine and progres-sive rules to construct an adjective progressive relationship graph at first. Then, a link analysis method, propagation [19], is performed on the generated graph. The outcome value of each node (representing each adjectiv e word) is treated as the strength. The details of graph construction and the propagation algorithm are described as follows. 3.3.1 Graph Construction In Chinese, some pairs of adjectives are fr equently used in company with to express an emphasized emotion. For example,  X  She is very beautiful and very smart  X  (  X  X  X  X   X  X   X  X  ), and  X  She is not only beautiful but also smart  X  (  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ), etc. We define such kinds of patterns as progressive relation rules of adjectives. Based on those heuristic rules, we can associate the two adjectives (nodes) with a link, rep-resenting one support the other in sentiment strength. For example, if two adjectives from Adj i to Adj j . 
A total of 3,497 adjective words are collected from the Chinese lexicon. These ad-jectives are represented as the nodes in the graph. For each pair of adjectives Adj i and between them through the search engine. Three queries of the two adjectives Adj i and Next, we submit those three queries into the search engine (e.g., Google.com). The relation from Adj j to Adj i in the same way. 
We get in total 306,547 non-zero progressive relationship values for the adjective in formula (3). number of search result C ij . The logarithm is taken because the number of search re-some pairs would take dominant role in the computation as they have large weight. 
After obtaining the nodes of adjectives and the relation links with weight between adjectives, we can construct an adjective pr ogressive relationship graph. A sample of this graph is shown in Figure 1. In this figure, we can see that the word  X  X ice X  has a progressive support for the word  X  X eautiful X , and the progressive relation from  X  X ice X  to  X  X eautiful X  is captured by the rule patterns based queries described in Table 1 from search engine. 3.3.2 Propagation Algorithm each adjective. The basic idea underlyin g the propagation method in the adjective word will be offset if it is pointed by both positive and negative ones. 
Therefore, after obtaining the generated adjective progressive relation graph from last step in Section 3.3.1, we choose the nodes with no in-degrees, and mark each of calculation is iteratively performed according to the following calculation formula (4). where W ji is the progressive relationship link weight in the graph form adjective node adjective w i in the graph. 
In each iteration, the strength of each adjective is calculated based on the sentiment strength of itself and its neighbors derived from previous iteration. Next, each strength score is normalized by dividing it by the maximal adjective strength score of current iteration. 
The terminal condition of the iteration here can be described as two aspects: first, predefined value  X  . Base on the propagation theory [20], this approach is convergent. 
After performing the propagation algorithm, the sentiment strength of each adjec-strength, and the negative value expresses negative sentiment strength. Moreover, higher value means stronger positive sentiment and lower value indicates weaker negative sentiment. 3.4 Strength of Adverbs The adverb in opinion sentiment feature is us ed to modify the adjective. An adjective modified by different adverbs may express di fferent emotional intensity. For example,  X  X xtremely good X  expresses a more powerful sentiment than  X  X ery good X  does. Both of them express stronger emotion than  X  X ood X  which receives no modification of the adverb. Therefore, adverb has non-trivial im pact on the review sentiment strength of sentiment expression which can not be ignored. 
We collect all the adverbs which are used to modify the adjectives from a Chinese lexicon. Based on the different emotional intensity expressed by the adverb, we mark score expresses a stronger sentiment. For example, we consider that the adverb  X  extremely  X  has higher strength than  X  more  X  does, but lower than that of  X  most  X . Consequently,  X  most  X  is marked with +1,  X  extremely  X  with +0.9, and  X  more  X  with +0.6. Negative adverbs, such as  X  X ot X ,  X  X ever X ,  X  X ardly X ,  X  X eldom X , are marked with a negative score -1. There is about 100 such kind of adverbs graded by two people intuitively and we get the average score for each adverb as the final strength score. Table 2 shows examples of adverb and their strength used in our experiments. 4.1 Experiment Setting We use a real hotel review dataset, collected from Ctrip.com 4 provided by Tan on his website 5 . This dataset contains 2000 positive reviews and 2000 negative reviews in the form of Chinese. We choose 200 positive and 200 negative reviews randomly from the dataset and score each one with five-scale evaluation manually according to the expressed sentiment strength. 
As mentioned in the previous part, we get in total 3,497 adjectives and 100 adverbs from the Chinese lexicon. The strength of each adjective and adverb is obtained by the proposed approach as previously described. The parameter  X  used in determining the opinion noun word is chosen as 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 respectively. The threshold  X  and  X  in the terminal condition of propagation are set as 0.001 and 100 respectively. 
We evaluate our proposed approach from two aspects  X  positive &amp; negative senti-ment classification and five-scale evaluation. In the first experiment, we use the five-fold cross-validation and eval uate the average classification accuracy. We first choose parameter  X  for the best performance on accuracy. Then, we compare our proposed approach which considers the strength of adjectives with method which only consid-ers the positive and negative polarity of adjectives. 
In the five-scale estimation, we use two evaluation criterions, namely precision and distance precision, to evaluate the experimental results. The distance precision is cal-culated as shown in the following formula (5). score and t i is the labeled five-scale score for the i th review. 4.2 Experiment Results Positive &amp; Negative classification sentiment analysis. Reviews are classified into two categories  X  positive and negative based on the expressed sentiment. In our experiment, we calculate the strength score of each review using formula (1) and (2). According to the calculated score, reviews achieved positive scores are considered as pos itive ones and negative scores are nega-tive ones. 
We use the five-fold cross-validation, which divides the 4000 reviews dataset into single part is rotationally retained as the validation data for testing while the remain-ing four parts for training. Then, we calculate the average precision for the sentiment achieves the highest precision 71.65% when the parameter  X  is 0.01. Precision 71.5% 71.65% 71.35% 71.1% 71.28% 70.15% 66.13% 
We compare the precision of the sentiment classification of our approach with the baseline which doesn X  X  consider the strength but only the positive or negative polarity precision with 5.7% higher than that without considering it in the positive &amp; negative sentiment classification. Five-Scale Estimation and 5 stars is the best. Table 4 shows the mapping table between the number of stars a review achieves and its corresponding streng th score. For example, if the sentiment strength of a review is calculated as 0.47, it means four stars. We evaluate the preci-sion and distance precision for our approach and show the result in Table 5. From the sentiment strength of review. In this paper, we propose an approach to evaluating the sentiment strength of reviews. We first extract the opinion phrases which consist of the opinion noun word and the modified opinion sentiment features from reviews, and then calculate the sentiment strength of review based on the extracted feature phrases. The strength of the opinion phrase is determined by the strength of the adjective word along with the adverb that modifies it. We mark the strength of adverbs manually and employ the link analysis method for calculation of adjective strength based on a progressive relation between adjective words. Experimental results show that our proposed approach is efficient and reaches a precision performance which is 5.7% higher than that without consider-ing the adjective sentiment strength. Our approach also achieves a good performance on five-scale evaluation. The effectiveness and scalability of our approach will be further evaluated on more different review datasets in the future.
