There is a surge of community detection of complex net-works in recent years. Different from conventional single-objective community detection, this paper formulates com-munity detection as a multi-objective optimization problem and proposes a general algorithm NSGA-Net based on evolu-tionary multi-objective optimization. Interested in the effect of optimization objectives on the performance of the multi-objective community detection, we further study the correla-tions (i.e., positively correlated, independent, or negatively correlated) of 11 objective functions that have been used or can potentially be used for community detection. Our experiments show that NSGA-Net optimizing over a pair of negatively correlated objectives usually performs better than the single-objective algorithm optimizing over either of the original objectives, and even better than other well-established community detection approaches.

Recently a large amount of research has been devoted to the task of defining and identifying communities in so-cial and information networks. Loosely speaking, commu-nities are groups of nodes that are densely interconnected but only sparely connected with the rest of the network [3]. To extract such groups of nodes, one typically chooses an objective function that captures the intuition of a commu-nity as a group of nodes with better internal connectivity than external connectivity. As a consequence, the commu-nity detection problem ( X  ,O ) can be formally defined as a Single-objective Optimization Problem (SOP): determine the partition C  X  for which where  X  is the set of feasible partitions, C is a community structure of a given network G and O :  X   X  R is an ob-jective function. Without loss of generality, we assume O is to be minimized. Most conventional community detection algorithms are based on the SOP. Different algorithms vary in the objective function O and optimization techniques.
These single-objective community detection algorithms have been widely applied to both artificial and real problems. However, they also face some fundamental difficulties. These single-objective algorithms attempt to optimize just one ob-jective function and this confines the solution to a particular community structure property. Moreover, these algorithms may fail when the optimized objectives are inappropriate. In addition, one single fixed community partition returned by the single-objective algorithms may not be suitable for the networks with multiple potential structures (e.g., hier-archical and overlapping structures).

It might be more natural and reasonable to consider the community structure from different angles (i.e. multiple op-timized objectives ) at the same time. That is, in the multi-objective community detection problem ( X  ,O 1 ,O 2 ,  X  X  X  ,O we aim to discover the community structure C  X  for which where t is the number of objectives and O i represents the i -th objective. With the introduction of multi-objective, there is usually no single best solution for this optimization task, but instead, the notion of Pareto optimality should be embraced. For two partitions C 1 ,C 2  X   X , the partition C 1 is said to dominate the partition C 2 (denoted as C 1 C 2 ) if and only if A partition C  X   X  is said to be Pareto optimal if and only if there is no other partition dominating C . The set of all Pareto optimal partitions is the Pareto optimal set and the corresponding set in the objective space is called the non-dominated set, or Pareto front.

Compared to single-objective approaches, the multi-objective community detection has many advantages. (1) The optimal solutions of the single-objective community detection prob-lems defined by ( X  ,O 1 ) ,  X  X  X  , ( X  ,O t ) are always comprised by the Pareto optimal set of the multi-objective problem defined by ( X  ,O 1 ,  X  X  X  ,O t ). (2) The multiple objectives can measure characteristics of community structure from differ-ent angles, and thus it helps to avoid the risk that one single objective may only be suitable to a certain kind of networks. (3) The multi-objective community detection usually returns a set of community partitions according to the multiple op-timized objectives. These community partitions reveal com-munity structure from different angles, which help to dis-cover complex and comprehensive community structures.
In order to effectively solve the Multi-objective Optimiza-tion Problem (MOP), we propose a general solution, NSGA-Net, which simultaneously optimizes multiple objective func-tions with an evolutionary algorithm. As a general multi-objective community detection solution, NSGA-Net can op-timize over any multiple objective functions. For this new community detection paradigm, one important issue is that what type of objective functions should be optimized to im-prove the accuracy of community partition. To solve this issue, we first study correlation relations among 11 popu-lar objective functions and divide the relations between any two objective functions into three categories: positively cor-related, independent, and negatively correlated. Then we compare NSGA-Net optimizing over six pairs of objective functions from these three types of correlations (two pairs for each type) to a SOP based approach optimizing over the original single objective. Experiments demonstrate that NSGA-Net only with negatively correlated objectives usu-ally leads to a better performance than that can be achieved by any of the original objectives. We also show that with a pair of negatively correlated objectives, the NSGA-Net per-forms better than most conventional community detection algorithms.
In order to effectively solve the multi-objective community detection problem, we propose the NSGA-Net solution based on Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). EA has been proven to be an effective method for MOP. Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization (EMO) has become one of the main research fields in the EA community, which has also been applied in data mining [11]. Conventional EMO algorithms are de-signed for numerical optimization problems. When we solve a real problem with EMO, many components of EA need to be redesigned.

Multi-objective optimization mechanism . In this paper, we select NSGA-II [2] as the multi-objective optimization mechanism in NSGA-Net. Four parameters govern the run of NSGA-Net: the population size popSize , the running gen-eration gen , the ratio of crossover croRat and the ratio of mutation mutRat .

Genetic representation . We apply the locus-based adja-cency [4] to represent a partition. In this graph-based repre-sentation, each genotype g consists of n genes g 1 ,g 2 ,  X  X  X  ,g and each g i can take one of the adjacent nodes of node i . Thus, a value of j assigned to the i -th gene, is then inter-preted as a link between node i and j . In the resulting solution, they will be in the same community. The decoding of this representation requires the identification of all con-nected components. All nodes belong to the same connected component are then assigned to one community.

Genetic operation and initialization . The uniform two-point crossover is employed. In the mutation operation, NSGA-Net randomly selects some genes and assigns them with other randomly selected adjacent nodes. In the ini-tialization process, we randomly generate some individuals. For each individual, each gene g i randomly takes one of the adjacent nodes of node i .

Model selection . NSGA-Net returns a set of solutions, which provides Decision Makers (DMers) with more choices. Sometimes DMers may desire that the set of candidate solu-tions could be narrowed down to those of most interest. In this paper, we therefore propose the novel Max-Min Distance model section method to select one single recommendation solution from the Pareto front. Inspired by Gap statistic [4], the Max-Min Distance method selects the solution model that mostly deviates from the null models generated by NSGA-Net by running on random networks with the same distribution. Concretely, NSGA-Net firstly runs on the real network and randomly generated networks with the same scale. Thus the optimal solution set on the real network (called CandSet ) and the corresponding random network (called RandSet ) can be obtained, respectively. For each solution in CandSet , we calculate the minimum-distance with solutions in RandSet , and then we select the solution in CandSet with the maximum minimum-distance as the recommendation solution. Here, Euclidean distance is em-ployed. Intuitively, the recommendation solution is the most different one from the solutions in RandSet .

Objective function . Still NSGA-Net has an important component unsolved: objective functions. As a general multi-objective community detection solution, NSGA-Net can ap-ply any multiple objective functions. With NSGA-Net, we will examine the general performance of the multi-objective community detection. Furthermore, we explore what type of objectives is suitable for the multi-objective paradigm.
Many objective functions have been proposed to capture the intuition of communities. We summarize 11 objective functions that are already widely used in community detec-tion literatures or can be potentially used for community detection. Figure 1: Pearson correlative coefficients of the 11 objectives. 1-11 represent the objective functions O 1  X  O 11 , respectively.
We roughly classify the objective functions into three cat-egories. The first category contains the first four objectives from graph theory community, which are called the cut-based objectives. The three objectives ended with  X  X DF X  are called the degree-based objectives. Finally, the remain-ing objectives are classified into one category. These objec-tive functions come from different research fields, such as graph theory and physics. All these objectives attempt to capture a group of nodes with better internal connectivity than external connectivity, and thus they all can be poten-tially used in community detection.
We can observe that the definitions of some objectives are similar, such as the cut-based objectives. Namely, these objectives are correlated. Here we apply the Pearson cor-relation coefficients to describe their relations. Because it is difficult to analyze their correlations from the definitions directly, we perform experiments to estimate the Pearson correlation coefficients. The experiments are done with the following steps. (1) For a given network, we generate a set of random partitions. (2) For each partition, we calculate the values of the different objective functions. Thus each objective function has a vector of random samples. (3) We estimate the Pearson correlation coefficients among these objective vectors. (4) In order to reduce the estimation vari-ance, we repeat step 1 to 3 many times and get the average values.

The results are illustrated in Figure 1. We can observe that the cut-based objectives are highly correlated (espe-cially O 1  X  O 3 ). It is the same case for the degree-based Figure 2: The NMI comparison of NSGA-Net opti-mizing over three types of objective functions (i.e., positively correlated, independent, negatively corre-lated) and GACD optimizing over original single ob-jectives on artificial networks. The larger the NMI, the better the performance. objectives. In addition, we notice that InternalDensity is negatively correlated with Q and CommunityScore . The relations of these objectives can be roughly classified into three categories in terms of their correlation coefficients: positively correlated (e.g., { O 1 ,O 2 ,O 3 ,O 4 } , { O { O 8 ,O 9 ,O 10 } ), independent (e.g., { O 1 ,O 8 } , { O 1 and negatively correlated (e.g., { O 8 ,O 11 } , { O 10 ,O
In this section, we will test the performances of the multi-objective community detection method (i.e., NSGA-Net) and find what kind of objectives are suitable for the method. Here we only consider two objectives, rather than more ob-jectives, in order to focus on the effectiveness of the multi-objective method and reduce the complexity. From each of the three categories of objective correlations, we select two pairs as the optimized objectives in NSGA-Net. Par-ticularly, for the positively correlated objectives we choose { O 1 ,O 2 } , { O 8 ,O 9 } ; the independent objectives, { O { O 4 ,O 9 } ; and the negatively correlated objectives, { O 8 { O 10 ,O 11 } . For the SOP: min C  X   X  O ( C ), we choose GACD [12] as the single-objective community detection optimizer. NSGA-Net is equipped with the same parameters with GACD for a fair comparison. That is, popSize = gen = 200; croRat = 0 . 6; and mutRat = 0 . 4.

We use a popular artificial network with a known commu-Figure 3: The comparison of NSGA-Net with a pair of negatively correlated objectives (i.e., O 8 and O 11 ) with other popular algorithms on artificial networks. nity structure [5], which has the heterogeneity in the distri-butions of node degrees and community sizes. Same in ref. [5], each node in the benchmark graphs share a fraction 1  X   X  of its links with the other nodes of its community and a frac-tion  X  with the other nodes of the network. As  X  increases, it becomes harder and harder to identify the community struc-ture. To compare the built-in modular structure with the one delivered by different objectives, we adopt the Normal-ized Mutual Information (NMI), a measure of similarity of partitions borrowed from information theory [5].

We first run NSGA-Net on the artificial networks. The comparison results of NSGA-Net optimizing over six pairs of objectives and GACD optimizing over original single ob-jectives are shown in Figure 2. When the optimized objec-tives are positively correlated or independent, NSGA-Net X  X  performances have no obvious differences from the perfor-mances of the optimization on each single objective with GACD. Most results of NSGA-Net are between those of the single objectives. However, it is obvious that NSGA-Net with a pair of negatively correlated objectives has better performance than the optimization on the original single ob-jective, since their NMI are larger than those of the single objective in most conditions.
We further validate the performance of NSGA-Net through comparing it with representative community detection algo-rithms. NSGA-Net is equipped with a pair of negatively correlated objectives O 8 and O 11 . Other five algorithms are included in the experiments. It includes the betweenness-based heuristic algorithm [8] (named GN) and its improved version [1] (named GN Fast). The EA-based optimization al-gorithm [12] (named GACD) optimizes the O 8 . The information-theoretic framework based algorithm (named INFO) [7] opti-mizes the O 9 . Another multi-objective method MOGA-Net [10] is also included. In order to obtain one single recommen-dation solution, MOGA-Net also employs the Max-Min dis-tance model selection method. NSGA-Net and MOGA-Net are set as the same parameters with GACD. The benchmark is the same artificial networks as before.

The experimental results are shown in Figure 3. In most conditions, NSGA-Net obviously performs better than other five algorithms including not only the single-objective algo-rithms but also the multi-objective method, MOGA-Net. An important difference between NSGA-Net and MOGA-Net lies in the objective functions. We think the absence of the sufficient negative correlation between objectives in MOGA-Net causes its bad performances.
In this paper, we study the multi-objective community detection problem and propose a novel solution NSGA-Net. Aiming to exploit the universal validity of the multi-objective solution for community detection and its requisition on ob-jective functions, we first analyze the intrinsic correlations among 11 objectives. Then we compare the performances of NSGA-Net optimizing over different types of objectives to those of a single-objective based approach optimizing over the original single objective. The experiments show that NSGA-Net only with a pair of negatively correlated objec-tives remarkably improve the performance.
