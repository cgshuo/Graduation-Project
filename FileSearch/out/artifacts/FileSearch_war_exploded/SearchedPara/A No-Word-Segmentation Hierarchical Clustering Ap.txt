As a post-retrieval document clustering algorithm, there are several key require-Agglomerative Clustering algorithms are probably the most commonly used, but they ments [2]. Linear time clustering algorithms are the better candidates, for example K-means, Single-Pass [3]. However, there are some shortcomings with these partitioning algorithms. For example, they can not provide overlapping clusters. In addition, most of these traditional algorithms are based on Vector Space Model (VSM) [4] and need to segment Chinese texts to many words as vectors, so the clustering results are influ-enced by the performance and precision of Chinese word-segmentation algorithms. NWSHCA is composed of five logic steps: document preprocessing, similarity com-puting, partitioning clustering, cluster label generating and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. 2.1 Step 1: Document Preprocessing non-Chinese characters are deleted. 2.2 Step 2: Similarity Computing In NWSHCA, we use a new similarity measure between two sentences based on a applicable to Chinese texts. 
It is obvious that for two sentences the more co-occurrence strings (common sub-KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pras) [7] to search the common substrings between two docu-is i-th common substring between A and B. tween two sentences. The longer common substring the two sentences have, the more similar they are. The formula (1) defines the similarity between two sentences: fects the number of initial clusters. 2.3 Step 3: Partitioning Clustering document snippets is obtained. NWSHCA uses partitioning clustering method based similar documents into a cluster. The cluster is represented by a centroid which is the average similarity among the documents within the cluster. Next expecting document is selected and compared to the centroid, and if the similarity between them exceeds such documents, other two nearest documents are grouped to another cluster and the process iterates till no document left. 2.4 Step 4: Cluster Label Generating top K common substrings as cluster labels. In this paper, we define: Where j-th document that contains curs in the j d ; m is the total number of documents in the cluster; ) S ( of documents that only includes i S in the cluster. 2.5 Step 5: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering ated. We adopt hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC), which allows one document belonging to different clusters. However, HAC is typically slow when ap-plied to large number of Web documents. To improve the performance of clustering, we only input the generated cluster labels instead of full texts of documents to HAC. The experiments in section 3 proved that the improvement is effective. 
The algorithm is described as follows: a. Select two unprocessed cluster description labels which have largest similarity in b. If there still exist unprocessed clusters then turn to a, or turn to c. c. Take the new generated super clusters with the new labels as the initial object for 3.1 Speed The purpose of NWSHCA is to improve the speed of clustering, especially in similar-ity computing and hierarchical clustering. In the experiments we also find the HAC is quickly finished after a few iterations, mostly six times. For 100 queries and first 100 Figure 1. In addition, we separately record the clustering average time for STC (Suf-fix Tree Clustering) and NWSHCA shown in Figure 3. The Figure 3 shows that NWSHCA has higher performance than STC, as STC needs segmenting words for Chinese document. 3.2 Efficiently Browsable We use Baidu [8] as Web search engine in NWSHCA and the result is displayed as a navigational tree shown in Figure 3. We also compare cluster number formed by NWSHCA with those by Vivisimo [9], using the same 16 Chinese keywords to search. The comparison results are shown in Table1. It is easy to see that the cluster number generated by NWSHCA is very close to Vivisimo on Chinese results. NWSHCA can cluster the Chinese Web search results efficiently without word seg-played as a navigational tree for browsing with ease. However, NWSHCA is inde-pendent to Chinese dictionary and the common substrings are not semantic, so sometimes NWSHCA may generate inaccurate cluster labels, for example  X   X  X  X  X   X . Extensive work is needed to improve the performance of NWSHCA and try to solve these problems.
