 We studied the mobile users X  preferences and concerns o f using location -based assignments (LBA) and geotagging in cro wdsourced news making. First , nine readers who had submitted reader X  X  phtos were interviewed about their perceptions of LBA and geotagging scenarios . Second, a quasi -experiment in field conditions was carried out with nineteen participants. After completin g four LBA tasks with a mobile phone , participants were interviewed on their perceptions and asked to complete a quest ionnaire on their preferences for receiving LBA and usage of geotags . Findings indicate that the perceived benefits of LBA and geotagging are greater than the perceived risks. The task type, temporal context, preciseness of location query, proximity to the reporting location, parallel tasks, social context and incentives affected the participation preferences. We propose a framework for part icipation preferences to support further studies in location -based crowdsourcing and in the development of crowdsourcing processes and systems .

 Crowdsourcing, location, privacy, news, assignment, user -generated content, UGC, reader . Crowdsourcing by using tasks [13] to get readers to contribute news content is one way to collaborate with the audience in news making [43] . It can strengthen the relationship between the participating audience and the newsroom in a new and fruitful way. U sing readers X  content is a cost -effective way of getting news content , story ideas or new angles to reporting [14] [30] and to provide relevant a content for the audience [34] [45] . Currently, n ews industry widely encourages readers to send photos and videos with their mobile phones. For example, a hyperlocal news provider in Helsinki metropolitan ar ea in Finland received 2077 reader X  s photos in May 2012 and about 20,000 reader X  X  photos in 2011. Majority of these photos were sent as MMS (multime dia) messages from mobile phones.
 This article focuses on the process of news content creation collaboratively with reader s, who are recruited to collaborate in news making. We concentrate on location -based crowdsourcing, in which the initiator (news organization) sends a task or makes available a task based on the participant X  X  (reader X  X ) mobile phone location (location -based assignment, LB A) for voluntary undertaking using smartphones as an enabler for participation. In addition, we study the attitudes towards geotagging of news content and the use of geotags in news publishing.
 In order to succeed in collaborating with the readers in the news making process, it is crucially important to understand what affects readers X  willingness to participate and how they understand their position as collaborator s in news making with media organisations. Since the role of location information is rapidly increasing in importance in the news media, information that aids in the development of the collaborat ive news making processes is needed. Furthermore, using everyday technology such as smartphones as tools has great potential especially in the field of hyperlocal journalism where community repor ters are recruited for voluntary work . However, location information is considered as private [17] [ 29] [40] . T herefore we need to investi gate how its use is perceived by readers who participate in news making . Only a few user studies exist on using a mobile phone X  X  location information in crowdsourcing with tasks [1] [43] or o n using location -based assignments in news making [42] [43] , although mobile tools for crowdsourcing have been developed and reported [12] ,[23] ,[47] . Especially how readers perceive 1) the usage of their location information for location-based assignments sent by the newsroom and 2) geotagging of the news content they generate as well as 3) what their preferences in these cases are have received little attention. This paper addresses these issues by presenting re sults from two user studies . Research questions are: RQ1. What affects mobile users X  participation preferences in location -based crowdsourcing with LBA that is facilitated by a news organization? RQ2. How do users perceive the risks of sharing their location information in the context of news making? The p aper presents the following contributions: -Framework for the dimensions of readers X  preferences to -Implications derived from the findings to aid in developing The idea behind the term crowdsourcing has its origins in the notions about the wisdom of the crowds [16], [36] as well as in collaborative creation and production [16] ,[38] . In addition to using microtasks that can contribute to a larger problem to be solved [22] ,[33] , crowdsourcing is used in fields requiring specific domain knowledge, expertise or creative skills. Examples include open source software development [38] , open innovat ion [2] ,[35] , eScience [5] , and citizen or participatory journalism [34] ,[45] . In this paper we focus on partic ipatory journalism in which reader s or volunteers participate in news making that is facilitated and managed by a news organization [34] . The progress of collaboration with the audience in news journalism has been rather slow despite strong advocates of participatory journalism and collaboration with the audience [4] , [11] ,[14] ,[30] . There are only few newsrooms i n the world that have experimented with opening their whole work process from selecting the news topics to editing and distributing the content to the audience. Usually professional journalists in traditional news organizations are still keeping the decisi on making power at each stage of the news production to themselves [34] . Most explorative, collaborative and open processes in news making are usually found outside the traditional newsrooms. Typically volunteer contributors ar e not compensated for their participation in these models. For example, ProPublica trialed an advanced process for collaboration with volunteers in investigative reporting based on a reporting network which reports on given investigative tasks. ProPublica also taps into the specific domain knowledge of the network members as sources or experts on specific themes under investigation (see also [6] ). However, similarly to OhmyNews 2 and Huffington Post are news sites fo r citizen journalism, professionals still facilitate and manage to varying extent the participation of the volunteer s to news making , even in cases in which volunteers act in the role of content curators [7] ,[34] . To link the crowdsourcing to different types of collaboration between the participating readers or volunteers and the newsroom, we apply here the categorization of citizen science projects [5] . Bonney et al. [5] describe three categories of co -operation between volunteers and scientists: 1) contribution , in which volunteers contribute data, 2) collaboration , in which scientists design the project and do the reporting, but volunteers contribute data and may analyze data and 3) co-creation , in which both volunteers and scientists are involved in all parts of the project from planning to the interpretation of results. In the context of news making, a similar type of categorization can be used for describing the co -operation types. Crowdsourcing, when defined as tasks to be carried out by the crowd, can be seen to apply to at least the first two types of collaboration. In journalism, most often readers or volunteers contribute content, that is, they send comments, photos and videos to the newsroom and the journalists control the process and publish the news . This type of participation is typically enabled and encouraged by the news organization by provi ding a possibility to submit content directly from the mobile phone or through online sites. The advantages are clear: new ideas and topics flow from the audience to the newsroom, newsrooms receive cheap content that often interests people in a different w ay than the usual journalistic content and the process itself strengthens the relationship between citizens and media outlets. http://www.propublica.org/ion/reporting -network http://international.ohmynews.com/join -our -team/ http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ However, volunteers can attain a more equal position when they become reader reporters who create content more independently or h elp the newsroom with their special information or expertise. Here the news making process resembles more a collaborative process. The citizen X  X  role is more of an equal co -worker when the professionals and volunteers join forces to analyze data, such as i n open data projects, but where the reporting of the results is still done by professionals. Another example of collaboration are cases where professional journalists use eye -witnesses as informants when reporting breaking news when no professionals are pr esent, or when the eye-witnesses are mor e informed of the event or possess alternative viewpoints. Professional journalists are transforming into mentors, curators or enablers who are interacting with the users in various ways [7],[25] ,[45] . The benefits are clear here too -there is often, if not always, more expertise among the audience than in the busy newsroom. The third stage in the user -newsroom interaction can b e called a co-creative process. The citizen content creators and professional journalists are working as equals in ideating the news, collecting information and analyzing it, and collaborating even in the reporting jointly. This third stage is a rare model due to the difficulty of opening the journalistic work process into a more democratic one [11] ,[34] . It is also somewhat unclear as to what kind of economical agreement this kind of co-creation sho uld be based on. When do the volunteers turn into professionals? In order t o enable readers to participate in crowdsourcing by carrying out news reporting assignments , one solution is to deliver the assignments to or enable access to them via mobile handheld devices. Solutions vary from using text messages (SMS), social media (Twitter, Facebook) and email to dedicated mobile clients and platforms for news reporting and assignments [15] ,[43] . CNN is one of the first large news organizations to provide a list of themes to report on in their mobile application for registered reader reporters (iReporters 4 ). Readers are asked to share footage and ex periences on specific topics, such as the Japanese nuclear catastrophe in spring 2011. A step further is the San Jose State University campus news publication Spartan Daily provides a mobile client for mobile content creation (Tackable It geotags captured photos and places them onto a map. It also enables readers to search for assignments based on a map of the campus area. By carrying out tasks readers win points and earn rewards, such as free tacos, i.e., they receive monetary incentives. Moneta ry incentives are also used in the case of Scoopshot acts as an intermediary, that is, a market place, between the registered citizen photojournalists and the news organizations. It provides a mobile client that enables uploading of photos based on ow n initiative and pricing them. It also provides a listing of current available tasks to carry out based on the current location of the mobile phone. Tasks can be offered by news organizations to a larger crowd or to a media organization X  X  own recruited com munity of participants. http://ireport.cnn.com/ http://spartandaily.com/ http://www.tackable.com/about/ http://www.scoopshot.com/ As these examples show, the mobile solutions for mobile crowdsourcing with news reporting assignments vary from using simple text messages that are accessible by all who have a mobile phone to sophisticated mobile clients that require smartphones and a data subscri ption or access to a Wi -Fi network. Furthermore, participation and its compensation var y from voluntary work to semi -professional type of participation with incentives offered for the tasks carried out . In location -based crowdsourcing when using location -based assignments and geotagging, we are dealing with mobile users X  location information and the wher eabouts of the mobile users. This type of personal information that can reveal for example patterns of daily routines, personal time spending locations and personal spaces, is sensitive for many users [3] [9] [17] [20] [21] [28] [40] [41] . Especially in the case of location tracking services (other parties tracking the user X  X  location), the concerns are greater than w hen using position aware services that rely on the device X  X  knowledge of its own location [3] . Earlier research shows that users X  willingness to share their whereabouts varies. To reduce the users X  privacy concerns and increase the acceptability of LBS (location -based services) , feedback from the service [40] as well as context -aware solutions and adaptation of sharing can be used [29] . Furthermore, factors affecting willingness to disclose location information have been reported as 1) the identity of the requester (who), 2) the reason for requesting (why), and 3) the precision of the request (what) [9] . Recent studies report a number of other factors that affect the willingness to share location information. When looking at sharing location with their social network, users appear more comfortable sharing locations visited by a large and diverse set of people than places visited by fewer people [39] . Users want to protect their home location, obscure their identity and not reveal their precise location or schedule [8] . Approximate and vague levels of location disclosure are reported to be preferred [24] ,[32] . On the other hand, studies show that if users find that the sharing of location information is useful for them, they are more willing to disclose their location [1] , [10] . For example, in the context of news making participants assessed it to be useful that the newsroom could l ocate professional reporters working in the field as well as reporters in the field could locate each other for organizing the reporting work [42] . To sum up, the willingness to share location based information depends on who wants to know, why the information is needed and what precisely is asked, in addition to the usef ulness of sharing, fun and the social context. Previous studies have presented technical solutions for how users can use LBS without reveal ing their location information by using a location anonymizer and a privacy -aware query processor [27] . The r esearch has come to discuss technical implications , describing how privacy is related to security and trust [9] , how to prevent undesired attacks [37] , or the role of push and pull technologies [46] . Furthermore, Kelley et al. [20] found in case of location based advertising that more advanced privacy settings than simple opt -in, opt -out would make participants feel more comfortable with sharing their location with advertisers and lead to sharing more information with t hem. B eing able to control the sharing of information with rules related to the user X  X  time , place and sched ule , appear s to be the most resistant way to prevent users from mistakenly revealing location information they do not want to disclose [20] . As the aim of our research was to support the development of the future crowdsourcing processes by using location-based assignments, one of the issues to consider is the privacy related preferences of location information. Finding solutions that are acceptable to a wide variety of users is important to ensure not only the contributions but also the democratic representation of the voice of the audience. Privacy related issues are addressed in the findings of our studies and the implications for the development of crowdsourcing processes of news are presented. The goal of the first study was to support the development of new crowdsourcing processes in hyperlocal news production. One of the Finnish hyperlocal news publishers that publishes online news and two print tabloids in the Helsinki metropolitan area, is developing their reader reporter concept. The c ontribution of photos from the mobile context is currently enabled by MMS messages. In addition, email and online submission is enabled. Most of the reader X  X  photos are published in an online gallery . Incoming photos with short desc riptive texts of about 200 characters when submitted from the mobile phone are used by the online journalists to spot interesting story ideas and breaking news, such as accidents. When the journalist spots an interesting topic , he/she contacts the reader w ho submitted the photo as well as other relevant informants such as officials to inquire further information. In case of accidents, the news desk sometimes is ahead of the officials on the facts about the incident. The most interesting story ideas submitte d as photos are turned into online news stories by the j ournalists in 10-15 minutes. Some of these stories are also used in print tabloids. Furthermore, writing, submitting and publishing of reader X  X  stories is supported online. Monetary incentives are pai d for the reader X  X  photos published in print tabloids. These incentives usually vary from two movie tickets (value 17 euros) to a maximum of 100 euros. As the news organization was considering the use of locating and location-based assignments, we aimed to explore the readers X  perceptions on the use of mobile LBA and automatic geotagging of the news content to gain an initial understanding of the acceptability and related preferences to support the process development.
 In t he first study in September 2010 [43] , one of the themes we explored was how readers who participated in the hyperlocal news creation by contributing news photos perceived future scenarios on location -based assignments (LBA) and geotagging of news photos. We fo cus here on these results from the interviews (see also [43] ). Based on earlier research on privacy concerns, we expected that participants would primarily be concerned with locat ing and hesitant to disclose their location. Thi s proved to be the case on the personal level for many . On the other hand, participants identified the created value and particularly the perceptions towards geotagging were positive as described next. Participants . Nine readers were recruited to pa rticipate in an interview on their experiences and future processes by a journalist working in the newsroom of the hyperlocal news publisher . All participants had been rewarded recently for at least one photo, which had been published in a printed news tabloid. The r ewards they had received varied from two mov ie tickets (value 17 euros) to 100 euros. Five participants were 51-60 years old , and four were 16-39 years old . Four participants were female. Two participants had prior experience of using location-b ased services. Procedure. Three participants agreed to answer through an online questionnaire, and six were interviewed. The s ame questions were asked both in the interviews and in the online questionnaire. Questions related to subjective perceptions and views were asked after presenting the scenario. The themes for the questions were created by paying attention to privacy preference related themes from earlier literature [9] ,[17] ,[24] ,[29] ,[40] on when, where and in what situations they would agree or would not agree to locat ing in order to receive reporting assignments. We did not mention privacy in the intervie w questions , following the approach of Kindberg et al. [21] . The i nterviews were recorded and transcribed. The p articipants were compensated with two movie tickets (value 17 euros).
 Analysis . The d ata was analyzed by using a qualitative data -driven content analysis for open questions, using open coding for emerging themes. The c oding was fixed as the analysis emerged, grouping codes under higher level categories. When inquiring abo ut perceptions on locating and location-based news reporting assignments , the following scenario was first described to the participants: When presented with the scenario, four groups of participants X  perceptions emerged: 1) positi ve (1/9), 2) conditionally positive (3/9), 3) reluctant, i.e. who acknowledged the value of locationing for news reporting but who were not willing to be located themselves (3/9), and 4) negative, i.e. against the idea (2/9). The prerequisites mentioned by the participants for taking part in this type of scenario were related to minimizing disturbance by remaining in control over 1) the availability for receiving assignments, and 2) when and where to be located, as well as 3) the answering to the assignment so that it is not compulsory and one is able to decide whether to take part or not. The p references mentioned were related to temporal (holiday, workday, not all the time), situational (when occupied with something else, such as with the family), and loca tional (home, workplace, downtown) issues. Specifically, areas further away from home, for example, when on the move somewhere in the city, downtown or similar, were mentioned as acceptable places to locate for assignments. Privacy issues and concerns wer e mentioned spontaneously by the participants (4/9). Three mentioned privacy protection and two mentioned the  X  feeling of being watched  X  or  X  X bserved X  . One of the participants described how his/her attitude towards locating depends on the consideration of the perceived benefits and risks: On the other hand, some participants (3/9) explicitly expresse d that they would allow locat ing for receiving news reporting assignments if they would be compensated for carrying out the task and would r emain in control of the locat ing and availability. One of them did not bring out the privacy related issues during the interview, but rather approached locat ing and availability to be a n issue to be solved with technology :  X  X t would not bother me if it had One of the participants described how he/she considers the benefit and cost relationship of privacy on a personal level to depend on the expected incentive:  X  X f I get paid enough, I can give up my privacy. X  P-7 . Furthermore, two participants compared the activity to contract work: "One has to get a reward for contract work. X  P-8 . The r esults indicate that people may be willing to give up the privacy of their location in exchange for a monetary benefit. On the other hand, as the nature of the activity that the readers are to be engaged to changes , the expectations of the participants may change towards contracted freelancing work. These issues need to be considered when developing the crowdsourcing based activity further, for example, on how the new way of working is launched and how possible incentives are used in the case of a crowdsourcing type of activity. Geotagged, time-stamped media content submitted by the readers would help the news reporting work at the news desk by 1) giving accurate information of the location and time line of the capture, 2) proving the authenticity of the material and 3) being able to map the content automatically when publishing the news online. Privacy related issues and concerns have in recent years been discussed in the media , like the potential dangers such as stalking and burglaries when users reveal their geo loc ation in social media. We therefore inquired how the participants view the automatic geotagging of news content. T he following scenario was first described to them : The p articipants found geotagging to be useful and to create added value in the case of news related content 1) for the news reporting phase as well as 2) for the readers. One participant had used the automatic geotagging of content on a mobile phone. He mentioned that he could control geotagging eas ily , taking into account privacy issues as well. He found that geotagging helps the journalist to do his/her job more easily, since sometimes there are problems in placing an event to the right location.  X ... I feel that None of the participants spontaneously mentioned any places or locations that they would not want to geotag. When specifically asked for possible places that they would not like to geotag or disclose, three participants mentioned content created at  X  X ome X  . One participant mentioned as a possible case a situation whe re the person should have been some where else at the time of capturing: The se results on geotagging of media content therefore indicate that the participants may see more benefit than ri sk in the automatic geotagging of captured content for news reporting purposes . Furthermore, geotagging was perceived to create value in the process of news making by increasing the accuracy of the reporting. In order t o gain a deeper understanding of the perceptions and preferences related to receiving location -based news reporting assignments and the geotagging of captured news photos and videos , we conducted a quasi -experiment in field conditions [18] . We aimed to pr ovide the news publisher with information to further develop their collaboration and ne ws publishing activities . In the quasi -experiment we used a simulated mobile crowdsourcing process with location-based assignments (LBA) [43] . The a ssignments were delivered as SMS messages to the test phone. The experiment was carried out in the mobile context with a within -subjects design. The experiment consisted of 1) four tasks completed with the mobile phone, 2) an interview after completing all the tasks, and 3) filling forms , including a pre -and a post -test questionnaire [43] . The sample consisted of 19 voluntary participants, who were interested in new mobile services that enable to se nd reader X  X  content to news organizations [43] . P articipants (12 female, 7 male ) were recruited through email lists as well as university web pages to participate in a reader reporting experiment with mobile phones. The average age of the participants was 29 years (Md=24). Most participants (16/19) were aged between 20 and 30 years, and the rest were 43, 44 and 61 years old. Eleven participants were students studying engineering, journalism, visual journalism or media. One part icipant was a photographer and one a journalist. All participants had prior experience o f using mobile phones for photo capture. The majority (10/19) of the participants had exper ience of using a mobile phone for send ing or sharing photos or videos with ot hers. Three participants had prior experience of sending reader X  X  photos or videos to newspapers. Almost half of the participants (8/19) used a navigator or a navigation service on a mobile phone monthly or more frequently . Three participants had prior exp erience o f other location -based services. The p articipants were compensated with two movie tickets (value 17 euros). The mobile phone used in the quasi -experiment was HTC Legend. Both the phone  X  X  own functionalities (MMS, photo and video capture) and a dedicated mobile service client OKReportteri [43] was used for capturing and uploading mobile media content. SMS messages were used for delivering the LBA. Regarding location information, OKReportteri enabled the uploadi ng of captured photo and video content to a backend service, from which the uploaded content and related metadata including the location of media content capture could be browsed with a standard browser. As the capturing of media content with the client wa s started, an approximate location was searched with network -based locationing. This search was visible to the user on the mobile client X  X  user interface. After the capturing of a photo or video, the network -based approximate location was always attached, but a GPS based location was attached only if the user agreed to the searching of the precise location . In the experiment we simulated the newsroom locating the mobile users by indicating in the description of the test assignment s that the participant X  X  location was known [43] . The location -based assignments were sent to the test phone as text (SMS) messages prior to each task within the test session that was arranged in a predefined pedestrian area. T he assignments indicated an approximate location (central square, pedestrian street, downtown, close to the boulevard), the topic of the assignment and instructions for capturing and sending [43] . Each participant received two photo and two video assignments. The order of the test conditions was pseudo-randomly counterbalanced. The following tasks exemplify photo and video assignments: Prior to the test, the participants were asked to fill in a paper -based questionnaire with demographic and other background information. Next, the participants received training for using the mobile phone used in the experiment. After carrying out the four mobile location -based assignments in the mobile context, the participants were interviewed about their experiences. The interview questions covered how the participant perceived 1) the assignments generally, 2) the usage of the location information for assignments, 3) the advantages and disadvantages of using the location information, and 4) the needs related to situational, locational and temporal control in the case of LBA. Privacy issues were addressed only on the participant X  X  spontaneous initiative. After the post -test interview, the participants were asked to fill in a paper -based questionnaire [31] which addre ssed 1) their preferences to receive LBA under different context and assignment related characteristics , as well as to 2) geotag their content and 3) the usage of the content X  X  geotag information. By collecting this information at the end of the experiment , we aimed at getting more realistic perceptions than we would have received by asking for assessments without hands -on experience o f LBA. The post -test questionnaire had three components: 1) preference s to share location information in the case of geotagg ing and location -based assignments with six dimensions for participation preferences (Table 1) , adapting the privacy control dimensions by Myles et al. [29] and using prior research findings from sections 2.4 and 4.2, 2) assessment of the level of the participants X  privacy concern s, applying the IUIPC scale [26] , and 3) the participants X  perception of the benefits or risks [40] of precise location sharing for receiving LBA and geotagging of media (Table 1) . To get a general background measure for the participants X  privacy concern, we selected six items from the Internet User X  X  Information Privacy Concerns instrument (IUIPC) [24] ,[40] . We used the following items from the IUIPC scale: 1) Control (nr.2  X  X onsumer control of personal information lies at the heart of consumer privacy. X ), 2) Awareness (nr.3  X  X t is very import ant to me that I am aware and knowledgeable about how my personal information will be used. X ), 3) Collection (nr.4  X  X  X  X  concerned that online companies are collecting too much personal information about me. X ), 4) Unauthorized Secondary Use (nr.4,  X  X nline companies should never share personal information with other companies unless it has been authorized by the individuals who provided the information. X ), 5) Improper Access (nr.3  X  X nline companies should take more steps to make sure that unauthorized people cannot access personal information in their companies. X ) and 6) Risk Belief (nr.1,  X  X n general, it would be risky to give the newsroom a permission to locate the mobile phone. X ). The first five items were used as a scale for the general privacy concern of the participants. The higher the score the more concerned the person is for his/her privacy. The sixth item, Risk Belief, was used separately for the assessment of perceived risk of locat ing within the context of news reporting. A seven-point Likert scale was used for the assessment of the statements (1=Strongly disagree, 7=Strongly agree).

Table 1. Dimensions of participation preferences and assessment The audiorecorded post -test interviews were transcribed and analyzed with data-driven content analysis in NVivo8. As analysis eme rged initial open codes were replaced with fixed codes and categorized. Questionnaire data was analyzed with SPSS analysis tool using nonparametric methods, that is, descriptive statistics and with nonparametric correlations (bivariate with Kendall X  X  tau, 2-tailed). The 5 -item scale for privacy concern was tested for internal consistency reliability with Cronbach X  X  alpha ( X =.73). Based on the post -test questionnaire we calculated a general privacy concern score for each participant as the sum of the f ive IUIPC scale items (1-5) . All participants were concerned with their privacy (Privacy concern score: min=5, max=7, Md=6.5, M=6.39, SD=.58). However, based on nonparametric correlations, the privacy concern score did not have statistically significant correlations with any other questionnaire items. This indicates that the general privacy concern score does not give a prediction of participant X  X  perceptions of the privacy concerns in the specific context of crowdsourced news reporting. This is reflected w ith participants X  assessment the IUIPC item on Risk belief:  X  X n general, it would be risky to give the newsroom a permission to locate the mobile phone. X  Statement was disagreed with (Scale 1= X  X trongly disagree X , 7= X  X trongly agree X : min=2, max=7, Md=3, M=3 .68, SD=1.57). Our results therefore indicate that even though participants were concerned for their privacy in general, most of them did not find it especially risky to share their location with the newsroom if acting as reader reporters. Most of the par ticipants assessed giving permission to locate their mobile phone precisely mor e beneficial than risky (  X  X iving permission to the newsroom to locate my mobile phone precisely is... X  Scale: 1= X  X uch more risky than beneficial X , 7= X  X uch more beneficial than risky X ; min=2, max=7, Md=5, M=4.74, SD=1.33). This is consistent with the findings on Risk belief. Most participants therefore found benefit in sharing the precise location in the context of mobile news making and assessing the benefits higher than the risks involved.
 Geotagging precisely the location of the multimedia capture was assessed as more beneficial than risky by all participants (  X  X eotagging the precise location of the place of capture to the multimedia I send to the newsroom is... X  Scale: 1= X  X uch more risky than beneficial X , 7= X  X uch more beneficial than risky X ; min=5, max=7, Md=6, M=5.95, SD=.78). This finding supports our finding f rom the first study that in the context of news the participants see value in geotagging and in the use of geotags . The interviews revealed both advantages and disadvantages related to LBA. The mentioned advantages were: getting tip -offs for relevant content that newsroom is interested in, proving the authenticity of the material and therefore increasing the reliability of the reporting, enabling the newsroom to get what they are interested in , and enabling faster news reporting when the newsroom is able to spot someone close -by.
 The perceptions on the disadvantages of LBA were related to privacy and disturba nce (see Table 2). Three groups of privacy related issues emerged: 1) revealing personal and private time spending locations and patterns 2) the location information ending up in wrong hands or misused for stalking and 3) revealing some location accidental ly, which one would like to keep secret from friends or close -ones. One participant exemplified accidental revealing of a secret location that one could be  X  caught lying  X  and  X  end up in trouble  X . This could happen if one is somewhere else where one has tol d others, like friends, to be at, in case one submits news material based on location information and the identity is revealed. Only three participants specifically mentioned that there would be no disadvantages. The s pecific locations mentioned by the interviewees that they would not like to disclose or be located at were 1) places described as  X  X hady X  ,  X  X ot acceptable X  ,  X  X mbarrassing by their nature X  (4/19), and 2) home or other private places (2/19). By contrast , downtown was mentioned as a specific acceptable place to locate (2/19), similar ly to the first study. Some participants said that they would prefer locatio n obfuscation, that is, approximate or vague location disclosure over precise.
 Situations in which the participants mentioned a need to control the disclosure of the location were when one wants to be in peace, that is, undisturbed, like on a holiday or at work (3/19), or if doing something illegal (1/19). On the other hand, some participants mentioned that the need for the control of both location disclosure and availability would depend on the agreement made for reporting, and who has access to and is usi ng the location information. One participant spontaneously raised the monetary incentive to change his/her attitude towards being available for assignments , similarly to the first study. The post -test questionnaire focused on the part icipants X  preferences in the case of LBA and geotagging. We used the following type of questionnaire items. For example, in the case of agreement related to location, the item statement for  X  X pproximate location X  (see Table 1) was the following:  X  The n ewsr oom can locate my mobile phone at the precision of the neighborhood because I have given permission to the newsroom to locate my mobile phone X  . The scale used for all the items was a seven -point Likert scale (1= X  X trongly disagree X , 7= X  X trongly agree X ). To illustrate the results , we present the assessments in three groups of frequencies by combining disagreements (1-3) to one group ( X  X isagree X ), neutral to one group (4= X  X either agree or disagree X ), and agreements (5 -7) to one group ( X  X gree X ).
 Organization ty pe . The type of the news organization, whether 1) hyperlocal or 2) national, did not affect the preference to share or publish the geotag nor to receiv e LBA sent by the newsrooms (Table 3). This seems to indicate that the willingness to collaborate with an d trust in both types of organizations is similar. Table 3. Preferences related to the type of the news organization. Preference for the task type . Shooting photos and video clips was the most preferred task, followed by writing a news article (Table 4). We expected that making an interview would not be preferred by the participants, since it involves being in conta ct with externals and not being able to carry out the assignment in a very short time. As can be seen from Table 4, making interviews is the least preferred, but still over half of the participants were willing to carry out interview assignments as well. The r esults indicate that a diversity of contribution types can be asked for and used in the collaboration when using LBA.
 Temporal preferences to receive LBA . In general, the participants wanted to control when to receive LBA, but no specific best time can be identified for LBA based on the results (Table 5) . This calls for personal control of availability that could be supported by context -aware solutions or with a simple opt -in, opt -out solution.
 Location preferences . The p articipants assessed their p reference to receive LBA in four locations (see Table 6). The proximity to the reporting location seems to be the most important factor for the location related preference to receive LBA . Instead of the push based solution studied here, location -based retrieval (pull) of tasks is a relevant solution to be considered, such as that provided by Tackabl e or Scoopshot (section 2.3) or proposed by Alt et al. [1] . Table 6. Preferences related to the location of receiving LBA. Precision of location query . The p articipants clearly preferred the obfuscation of their location when it comes to locating their mobile phone. Both approximate and vag ue levels were preferred over precise locat ing. In addition, anonymous locat ing in the case of precise locat ing was preferred, compared with precise locati ng. Therefore, the obfuscation of the location by lowering the preciseness as well as using anonymity seems to be acceptable and less intrusive. Somewhat surprisingly , over half of the participants were willing to share their precise location with no obfuscation. However, as indicated by the previous results on preferring to receiv e LBA in the proximity o f the reporting location , us ing either approximate locati ng or using anonymous but precise locat ing seem a feasible solution. Preference for the situation to receive LBA. The p articipants were the most willing to agree to receive LBA for news content when they have nothing else to do (Table 8). The next most preferred times were i n leisure time and alone. Interestingly, about half of the participants were willing to receive LBA when working or studying or when in the company of others. It therefore seems that these participants do not perceive LBA as a disturbance.
 The goal of our research was to study the preferences to participate in location -based crowdsourcing of news content w ith location -based assignments (LBA) and attitudes towards geotagging of news co ntent. Our practical aim was to support the development of mobile location -based crowdsourcing processes for hyperlocal news . The presented framework for participation preferences can be applied when studying and implementing mobile crowdsourcing processes . We describe our findings and present implications for designing location-based crowdsourcing processes in the context of news journalism . Based on earlier research and the results of our first study , we created an initial framework for studying the partici pation preferences and concerns. It was used in the planning of the second study and in the development of the questionnaire items for users X  preferences. We created initially items for six dimensions of preferences (see Table 1): 1) Organization type, 2) Task type, 3) Temporal context, 4) Location to receive LBA, 5) Precision of location query, and 6) Situation (Social and task context). Organization type. Earlier research shows that who is asking for the location disclosure is important for the users [9] [29] . In our second study we investigated whether there is a difference if the news organization sending LBA or using geotags is national or hyperlocal. Participants were willing to share their location information independent of the news organization X  X  type for geotagging of news footage and for allowing the use of geolocated content by the news organization when published. No difference between national or hyperlocal news was found for LBA. A ll except one participant was willing to receive LBA . When using readers X  geolocated content in news publishing , the anonymity or pseudonymity of the content creator when publishing may further advance the will ingness to add the geotag to reader X  X  content. These results are promising as they open a v ariety of possibilities for different types of news organizations to develop their collaboration processes with the audience . Using geotags enables developing new forms of news stories for the audience to consume online and specifically with mobile devices. Geotags enable, for example, pull or push of location-based news . Furthermore, geolocated news could be available through existing social media solutions, such as Foursquare or Facebook or with augmented reality solutions (e.g. Leyar, Junaio or dedicated news clients). These could attract more participants to news making . Task type . In the second study, we looked at participants X  preferences to carry out four types of reporting tasks: Writing a story, carrying out an interview, shooting a photo and shooting a video clip. S hooting news footage (photos, video clips) was the most preferred, along with writing a news story. Conducting an interview was the least preferred, but still over half of the participants were willing to conduct interviews . Requested contribution type s of tasks (type of content, activity, needed effort) are therefore relevant aspect s to consider when planning the activities as also discussed by Alt et al. [1]. Contribution types or more generally the type of activity that is asked for could also be used in the profi ling of the participants, along with special skills, expertise, interests, and the reporters X  equipment [41] . Furthermore, the task description should provide the needed information in a compact and easily understandable form [42] . Temporal context . Temporal preferences are related to when participants are willing to receive or alternatively retrieve or carry out LBA. In both of the studies, the temporal preferences of the participants to receive LBA varied . T his indicates a need to be able to control the receiving of location -based assignments, such as using context -aware solutions that automatically adapt the availability for receiving LBA, like calendar information [29] . However, temporal preferences may also depend on other factors, such as the actual implementation of the LBA process such as: the type and nature of the technological solution or tool that is used for delivering LBA; the use of push or pull solutions; the intrusiv eness of the notification; the details of the possible official agreement between the organization and the reader reporter on LBA, such as incentives or a possibility to select and undertake the task to themselves, urgency of the request and whether the LB A is sent to one or a group reporters or generally to anyone involved. These issues are not only related to temporal preferences but also more generally to developing the models, mobile tools and processes of crowdsourcing [1] , [35] . Situation. When studying the preferences related to mobile user X  X  situation at the time of receiving the LBA, we looked specifically at the social (alone, in the company of others) and parallel task dimensions (when nothing else to do, in leisure time, when working or studying) of the context of use [19] . Receiving an assignment was the most preferred when a person had  X  X othing else to do X  followed by  X  X n leisure time  X  or  X  when alone  X . However , over a half of the participants of the second study were willing to receive LBA also  X  X hen working or studying X  or  X  X n the company of others X . Similar issues as presented for temporal context may affect the willingness to receive the assignments. As described for temporal context t hese aspects can be supported by technology and the developed crowdsourcing processes . Location. Finally, we studied in both of the studies the perceptions of using location information for LBA and geotagging. The location info rmation was clearly important for participants . In the first study the location related preferences and concerns were primarily related to the publicity of the place or the perceived private nature of the place, the ongoing activity or revealing things abo ut oneself that one would not want to share. These were echoed in the interviews of the second study as well. In the second study, we studied the preferences from the point of view of the place of receiving LBA and the precision of the location query for locating the mobile phone for sending LBA. The proximity to the reporting location was important ; the shorter the better. This indicates the importance of receiving relevant and potential tasks to carry out if these are delivered to the phone based on the l ocation of the reader reporter X  X  mobile phone. Alternatively, being able to retrieve LBA based on own location as in [1] or in real -life solutions of Spartan Daily or Scoopshot can be considered. Based on our findings, the eff ort required due to travelling is an important factor when reporter is considering whether to carry out a task or not . Therefore, solutions for delivering or retrieving LBA that are potentially relevant and feasible to the users to carry out is important.
 Obfuscation of location or identity information was clearly preferred over precise locat ing for LBA. The approximate level of location preciseness (neighbourhood) was preferred in addition to vague level. This seems a reasonable level for news reporting purposes as well. In addition, in combination with the proximity of the reporting scene to the participant, this seems a good option for locati ng especially when carried out by the news organization and not initiated by the mobile user . Although both locating by the news organization and user initiated retrieval of LBA based on location seem a possible solution, the user initiated retrieval may be more acceptable for a larger number of users, since it potentially decreases the feeling of being monitored or tr acked and the intrusiveness of the location request.
 Incentive. In addition to the six dimensions of preferences that we defined for the initial framework, findings indicate a seventh dimension, that is, incentives. The interview results from both of the s tudies indicate that a monetary incentive and possibly an a priori contract for carrying out the task may have an effect on the willingness to share location information when the LBA is sent based on the locating of the reporter X  X  mobile phone by the news organization. However, in practical terms news organizations need to consider as to what kind of effects incentives or contracts have on the activity and on the collaboration in hyperlocal news making. The reader participation to hyperlocal news is current ly based primarily on volunteering . In a further study on readers X  motivations to contribute to hyperlocal news [44], 39 active readers reported most often fun and the opportunity to get a reward as motivations. Informing other s of local issues was the third most often reported motivator . Results indicate that monetary incentives or other ways to get feedback are important [2] when designing crowdsourcing processes . Further dimensions for preferences. Our findings and previous research suggest also further dimensions to be included in the framework for preference dimensions. These include the anonymity or pseudonymity of the participants. In addition, as discussed earlier, the implementation of the pr ocesses and technology, such as use of push or pull of tasks is relevant to consider as a dimension [1] . These issues should therefore be considered when developing the crowdsourcing processes.
 In the first study, most participants were reluctant to share their location information wi th the newsroom to receive LBA, but they were willing to geotag the created news content. The participants of the second study were concerned for their privacy , when assessed for their general concern for sharing their private information . However, mos t of them did not find it risky to share their locatio n information with the newsroom . In additio n, most participants perceived the benefits of giving permission to locate their mobile phone and geotagging news footage greater than the risks . These findings along with the findings related to the first research question are consistent with findings from earlier studies e.g. [9] . When users identify who is requesting the location information and why the information is needed, as well as when the sharing is perceived as useful and creating or providing added value, they are mo re positive towards sharing location related information and privacy concerns are mitigated . Practical implications . Our results indicate that using location information in reader reporting activity is possible to implement in practice by the news organiz ations . In case of LBA , this should happen based on an informed consent and agreed terms especially in the case of locat ing the mobile users based on their mobile location and sending them location -based assignments (push) . As discussed earlier, user initiated retrieval of LBA (pull) may be more acceptable than push in terms of considering the privacy related issues. Furthermore, the participants mentioned as benefits for themselves in location -based crowdsourcing the tip -offs for reporting as well as the u sefulness and easiness of automatic geotagging for the activity carried out in mobile context [43] . Geotags were also mentioned to provide value by making it easier to identify and use accurate location information in geolocati ng. This in turn provides value for the audience when consuming news . Overall, the perceived benefits of using location information seem to be assessed higher than the risks indica ting that news organizations may explore this potential and develop their pr ocesses as well as reported news stories accordingly.
 Relevance, l imitations and future work. Overall, only a few user studies exist in the field of journalism that support the development of future location-based assignment processes [42] [43] . R esults and implications based on our studies can be used as initial guidelines when developing LBA and geotagging related processes and tools from the point of view of re aders  X  preferences . Furthermore, the a pproach presented to studying and categorizing the relevant preference dimensions provides an initial framework to develop and refine further . The results from our user studies are not directly generalizable due to the smal l number of participants, opportunistic sample and the studies not being long -term field trials in real -life journalistic processes. The first study inquiring the perceptions of the users based on scenarios of use and the second study being a quasi -experiment in field conditions provide indicative but not definitive results. In addition, the culture and the country in question may have an effect on the findings as well as the organization type may affect the results in the case of  X  X ellow press X , for example. Future research could addres s the use of mobile assignments as well as LBA in real -life crowdsourcing settings with news organizations and compare use of intermediaries, such as Scoopshot, with news organizations X  own reader reporter communities. Specific issues to address could include the motivations to participate in the activity, incentives, solutions for supporting high quality contributions by the participants, as well as the changes in the work processes, roles of the professionals and in the collaboration between the newsroom and readers , for example. We presented a framework with seven dimensions for the preferences of reader s to participate in location -based crowdsourcing of news content . The seven dimensions are 1) Organization type, 2) Task type, 3) Temporal c ontext , 4) Location to receive LBA, 5) Precision of the location query, 6) Situation (Social and task context) , and 7) Incentives . We found that all other dimensions except the organization type affected the willingness to receive LBA. Furthermore, w e found that most participants of the second study did not find it risky to share their location information with the newsroom. The benefits and created value of LBA and geotagging were mainly perceived greater than the risks, both on a personal level and for news production. Using location information of the reader reporters therefore seems to offer new possibilities for the news organizations. The presented framework can be used in future studies on location -based crowdsourcing and in informing the development of location -based crowdsourcing processes .
