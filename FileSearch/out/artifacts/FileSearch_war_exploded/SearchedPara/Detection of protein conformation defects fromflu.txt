 fl icts involve muscular intranuclear inclusions (INIs) indicative of fi cation accuracy and computational time are demonstrated by 1. Introduction
Protein conformational diseases (PCD) are pathologically diverse disorders in which speci fi c proteins accumulate in certain organs.
Each proteopathy of PCD is characterized by a disease-speci buildup of aggregated proteins within cells, or tissues, of the body.
Under the electron microscope, such deposits of abnormal protein aggregation often have a fi brillar appearance associated with at least 40 human diseases, including oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), Alzheimer ' sdisease,Parkinson ' sdisease,Huntington ease and prion diseases ( National Center for Biotechnology
Information, 1988 ). Patients with PCD may bene fi tfromearly diagnoses in order to receive pri mary care or undergo surgical procedures to address their progressive symptoms ( Westerheide and Morimoto, 2005 ). This study aims to provide the medical decision criteria, speci fi cally for detecting OPMD, to physicians, and may also assist them in identifying dif fi cult cases. The OPMD involves a cognitive decline and psychotic manifestations. There is currently no cure for OPMD. In most cases, the microscopic images of OPMD patients have certain muscular intranuclear inclusions (INIs) that are the hallmark of this disease ( The National Center for Biotechnology Information, 1988 ; Blumen et al., 2009 ).

For the OPMD microscopic images, it is dif fi cult to analyze the complex structures of the images because of irregular sizes of cell images and INIs. Possible approaches to detecting OPMD would be to apply the existing segmentation methods, such as the threshold selection in the spaces of RGB (for the red , green , and blue light) ( Rafael and Wood, 2008 ) and HSI (for the hue , saturation , and intensity )( Liu et al., 2007 ), mathematical morphology ( Shitong and
Ming, 2006 ; Thiran and Macq, 1996 ), graphical model design ( Murphy, 2010 ), active contour realization ( Yang et al., 2005 ; Ray and Acton, 2004 ), and watershed transformation realization ( Beare, 2006 ; Gao et al., 2008 ). However, much of the focus in ( Shitong and Ming, 2006 ; Thiran and Macq, 1996 ; Murphy, 2010 ;
Yang et al., 2005 ; Ray and Acton, 2004 ; Beare, 2006 ; Gao et al., 2008 ) has been on the information of shapes, and thus is unable to present quantitative measurements for image intensities from color images. In this study, by analyzing the local and global qualities of the images, we employ a bin threshold based techni-que to fi lter the image backgrounds into a histogram margin for the purpose of texture features extracting from a measurable region.

Nowadays, pattern classi fi cation problems often involve large feature datasets. For large datasets , the computational complexity of classi fi cation increases with each additional feature ( Bandyopadhyay and Pal, 2007 ). Feature synthesis is an approach to creating new functional features, using available basic features, with minimal user The approach consists of heuristics for data mapping from the hyperspace of basic features ont o the lower feature-synthesized dimensions. It has been applied t oproblemsrangingfromsimpleto complex with improved classi fi cation performance ( Guo et al., 2005 ; Krawiec and Bhanu, 2005 ; Costa et al., 2010 ).

Genetic programming (GP) is recognized as an effective research paradigm in various optimization tasks, such as machinery fault detection ( Guo et al., 2005 ), object recognition ( Krawiec and Bhanu, expectation maximization (EM) algorithm has been applied to segmenting sparse feature points in long image sequences involving independently moving objects, occlusion, and parallax effects ( Pundlik and Birch fi eld, 2008 ) and detecting the signals for multiple-antenna systems in wireless communications ( Chan and Choi, 2007 ). A combination of techniques based on the bin-threshold and feature-synthesis for an application for detecting OPMD, one variety of PCD, from fl uorescence microscopy images is an approach that has not been explored before. We propose a method involving evolutionary GP and the EM algorithm to synthesize feature functions based on basic features extracted from the Histogram Region of Interest Fixed by Thresholds (HRIFT-GP-EM) for the classi fi cation of OPMD.

We note that a preliminary version of this approach was reported in previous conference paper ( Guo and Bhattacharya, 2009 ). In this paper, we present an extended analysis of the approach, including formulating the Ave (CV%), and evaluating the affects of different feature sets in terms of their performance. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The background, including GP and EM, is addressed in Section 2 . Material preparation is introduced in Section 3 . Section 4 describes the proposed method for detecting OPMD. Section 5 reports experimental results and comparisons. The discussion and conclusion are given in Sections 6 and 7 , respectively. 2. Related background 2.1. Evolutionary GP
The evolutionary GP works in a loop structure as follows: (a) start with a randomly generated population of GP trees (candidate solutions to problems); (b) calculate the fi tness of each individual tree in the population; (c) produce a new population of GP trees using the operators of reproduction, crossover, and mutation on copies of the selected individuals. This process is repeated until a termination criterion (which is chosen according to a problem domain) is reached to stop the run. The details of GP can be found in ( Koza, 1994 ). 2.2. The EM algorithm
The EM algorithm is an ef fi cient iterative procedure to compute the maximum likelihood (ML) operation for the models having hidden data. In the ML operation, we wish to estimate the model parameter vector  X  in which the observed data are the most likely ( Dempster et al., 1977 ).

The EM takes the expected value E [ln P ( Y |  X   X  )/  X  , T ] over the probability distribution P ( Y |  X   X  ) to govern the random variable Y ,a combination of the observed data t i  X  T and unobserved data z The EM uses its current hypothesis, h , in place of the parameter vector  X  , including the mixing probability vector  X  , the mean vector  X  and the covariance matrix  X  . Given the observed portion T of the full data Y , the EM de fi nes a function Q (  X   X  |  X  In general, the EM algorithm is a two-stage (the E-step and M-step) iterative optimization approach to fi nding the ML solu-tions in probabilistic models ( Dempster et al., 1977 ; Bishop, 2006 ): 1. E-step: use the current parameter vector  X  ,  X   X  {  X  , to calculate the function of Q in the format of Q (  X   X  |  X 
Q  X   X   X  j  X   X  X  E  X  ln P  X  Y j  X   X   X  =  X  ; T :  X  1  X  2. M-step: derive the revised parameter vector  X   X  that maximizes the Q function.  X   X   X  argmax Q  X   X   X  j  X   X  :  X  2  X  3. return to the E-step and let  X   X   X   X  , if the convergence criterion is not satis fi ed.

See further details of the EM in ( Dempster et al., 1977 ; Bishop, 2006 ). 3. Materials
The microscopy image dataset of OPMD, named OPMD_PCD was acquired from the Centre Hospitalier de l  X  Universit X  de Montr X al, Montr X al. Associated with antibodies and molecular probes, green fl uorescence protein was engineered to produce various colored mutants that targeted the INIs of OPMD and the locations of cell organelles. Referring to the acquiring sequences of DNA (by fusing antibodies to speci fi c proteins) and parallel images (called the co-localization), pathology experts divided image cells on OPMD_PCD into healthy and sick conditions of OPMD. Illu-strated in Fig. 1 are four samples of fl uorescence microscopy images from OPMD_PCD in the binary classes of healthy and sick conditions of OPMD. Each sample contains a single cell on a white background with an 8-bit display (256 bin levels) in the JPEG (an acronym for the Joint Photographic Experts Group) format. 4. Proposed method
Fig. 2 is a fl owchart of the proposed method, HRIFT-GP-EM, for the classi fi cation of microscopic images as healthy or sick related to OPMD on OPMD_PCD. 4.1. The texture extraction technique
In color images, the term intensity denotes a color image component in certain color spaces. An intensity image is a data matrix whose values have been scaled to represent intensities. Grayscale images with an 8-bit display allow 256 different intensities, or bins (i.e., shades of gray). Composed exclusively of shades of gray, grayscale images, also known as black-and-white vary from black at the weakest intensity to white at the strongest.
The histograms of images provide a rich estimate of a region intensity distribution in image analysis ( Rafael and Wood, 2008 ). The histogram of a color image with L-bin levels is a discrete function, where the horizontal axis ( X -axis) corresponds to bin values and the vertical one ( Y -axis) corresponds to intensity levels (the number of pixels in the image). The grayscale histogram of an image illustrates the distribution of the pixels in the image in gray-level scales. Each pixel is placed in a bin corresponding to the color intensity of that pixel. Then in each bin all pixels are added up and shown in the grayscale histogram graph.

We begin by converting the groups of the images on OPMD_PCD (with an 8-bit display) into the grayscale 256-bin histograms.
Figs. 3  X  4 illustrates the histogram measurements for the categories of healthy and sick images on OPMD_PCD. From Figs. 3  X  4 ,withthe bin range of (0, 255) in the X -axis, we discover some notable characteristics on OPMD_PCD as follows: (1) The white background of all categories of healthy and sick images is fi ltered into the right margin of the histogram in the bin range of (200, 255), regardless of differences in size and shape (see Figs. 3  X  4 ). (2) The intensities of all healthy image cells are ranged from 0 to 75 with a unimodal gray-level histogram, i.e., having a single peak, indicating the low separation of intensity across the healthy image cells (see Fig. 3 ). (3) The intensities of all sick image cells, however, are in the large bin range of (0, 200) with either unimodal or bimodal gray-level histograms, due to their various degrees of optical luminosity emission (see Fig. 4 ). (4) Further examinations reveal that the lighter INIs of the sick images reside in the middle region of the grayscale histogram, partially overlapping the healthy cell histogram region in the range of (25, 75) without a distinguishable boundary between them (see Figs. 3  X  4 ); this indicates the low contrast of inten-sities between the healthy and sick image cells.

Accordingly, if we take into consideration the entire region of the grayscale histogram on OPMD_PCD, we could make errors in comput-ing the intensities of the INIs that possess discriminant texture.
In order to capture the color information of INIs, we apply a histogram-bin-threshold-based technique to limit the interval of their gray values, and name the interval the Histogram Region of Interest
Fixed by Thresholds (HRIFT). The upper threshold, T U ,ofHRIFTissetat a bin of 200, because of a near-zero intensity region centered at the bin of this value for both categories of healthy and sick images, see Figs. 3 and 4 . To determine the lower threshold T L ,wedesignthe

To avoid unnecessary computation, we select a bin-width of 5, rather than of 1, as an interval and then calculate the Ave(CV%) per unit of 5 in the bin range of (25, 75), as shown in Fig. 5 . A feature set with good stability and reliability should exhibit relatively lower variation to the mean among the samples ( Fukunaga, 1990 ).
In Fig. 5 , the optimal value of the bin should be at the lowest Ave (CV%), so we set the lower threshold, T L , at the bin of 50. Fig. 6 HRIFT-based texture extraction of (50, 200), together with the grayscale histograms of four sample images in Fig. 1 .
 Categories of the basic features extracted from the HRIFT The categories of 17 basic features, D1  X  D17, extracted from the HRIFT are as follows.

Moments (D1  X  D5)-q th order of moments ( Rafael and Wood, 2008 ):
D f  X   X  N HRIFT  X  z n  X  q p  X  z n  X  q  X  2 ;:::; 6 and f  X  1
Fourier Descriptors (D6  X  D11)-q th harmonic amplitude of Fourier descriptors ( Rafael and Wood, 2008 ):
Df  X  and b q  X  2 N Mean (D12)-average intensity ( Rafael and Wood, 2008 ): D12  X   X  N HRIFT z n p  X  z n  X  :  X  7  X

Here, z n indicates the intensity, q is the index of the moments in (4) and the harmonic amplitude of Fourier descriptors in (5) , n is the index of N HRIFT with n  X  1, 2, ... ,N HRIFT , p ( z n intensity levels, N HRIFT is the total number of intensity levels in the HRIFT (where N HRIFT  X  ( T U  X  T U ) + 1  X  151). At the end, the 17 HRIFT basic features are all normalized in the range of (  X  1, 1) to ensure that all input features are of the same order of magnitude. 4.2. The feature synthesis technique
The precondition for the technique of feature synthesis is the preparation of basic features. Upon receiving the input data X with the 17 basic features (D1-D17), the GP-EM begins to synthesize the features based on the data X for the data transformation via GP trees (see Fig. 2 ). As the input data of EM, the data T( transformed from X ) with the k known classes can be described in the mixture of the k Gaussians ( Bishop, 2006 ; McLachlan and Krishnan, 2008 ). In practice, the most common way is to assume the uniform probability, 1/ k , for the mixing probability vector  X  ; due to the independence for all the k components, the covariance matrix reduces to the variance matrix with  X   X  s 2 I , which contains only the common variance s 2 ( I denotes the identity matrix) ( McLachlan and Krishnan, 2008 ; Raymer et al., 2003 ). Therefore, via the EM, the learning task of the feature synthesis changes into the k -means problem with the parameter vector  X   X  {  X  }, which, when expressed in the two-stage process from (1) , (2) , is given by ( Bishop, 2006 ; Mitchell, 1997 ): the E step : E z ij  X  exp  X  the M step :  X   X  j  X   X  m i  X  1 E  X  z ij t i =  X  m i  X  1 E  X  z where  X  j is the mean of the j th Gaussian, E [ z ij ] is the probability bution, and z ij is a binary k -dimensional vector in which and only if t i is produced by the j th Gaussian.
 Following the generalization of the k -means problem via the EM, the design of the fi tness measure, the J value, aims to optimal solutions for the means of the k Gaussians by computing the inter-class separability and the intra-class homogeneity ( Fukunaga, 1990 ): J  X  ln j V  X  1 W V B j X  ln j  X  k j  X  1 n j  X   X  j  X   X  T  X  2 =  X  k where V W is the within-class scatter value, V B is the between-class scatter value, t i ( j ) is the i th sample from the j th class, n number of samples in the j th class and  X  T is the total mean value.
Next, the GP operators produce a new generation of synthe-sized features by varying the GP trees using reproduction, cross-over and mutation, see an example of a GP mutation in Fig. 7 .In the example, internal nodes are replaced with some mathematical operations, including addition, multiplication, sine and cosine functions. The leaf nodes receive the basic features, such as D2, D3, D5 and D11, from the output of HRIFT. The loop ends when the convergence test reaches the terminal criterion. After the com-plete run, as shown in Fig. 2 , the integrated technique of the approach yields the best solutions of synthesized features. 5. Experimental results
A collection of 600 microscopic images on OPMD_PCD is selected at random: 300 images are for training and 300 images for evaluation. To avoid any unnecessary computation, we choose a medium population size of 32 to help the approach sample the search surface to fi nd better solutions of synthesized features. Using a total of 17 basic features as the input, the training process is evolved in the maximum tree depth of 5. The GP terminal set consists of 17 basic features (see Section 4 ); for the GP function set, we select some mathematical operations using the signs of {  X  , , C , S, C, T, E, P, R, A, N}(see Table 1 ) with a random constant, as the synthesized features are designed for rational expressions via GP trees. The operations of division and square root are protected against divisions by zero and negative values, respectively.

In the evaluation, the minimum distance classi fi er (MDC) ( Fukunaga, 1990 ) is employed for both the feature synthesized by HRIFT-GP-EM and a certain number of the basic features extracted from HRIFT on the test set of 300 images. 5.1. The feature results
The number of evolutionary cycles prior to termination for the depends on whether an acceptable solution is reached. After evolving 350 cycles, the best resulting synthesized feature is given by: H f where D f represents the f th basic feature.

Fig. 8 shows the resulting data that are normalized in the range of (  X  1, 1). There are altogether 300 sample images from the binary healthy/sick classes, each with 150 images. We can see from Fig. 8 that the training data between the healthy and sick classes are clearly separated by the feature that is synthesized without any prior knowledge of the description of the training samples. 5.2. Classi fi cation results
The percentage of correctly classi fi ed test samples accounts for the performance of classi fi cation accuracy. Table 2 shows the classi fi cation results using the synthesized feature and a certain number of basic features with MDC on the test set of 300 images.
The synthesized feature yields at best 92.6% healthy/sick classi cation accuracy, as compared to the accuracies of 78.3%, 82.7% and 87.0% obtained by HRIFT using the 5 basic features (D1  X  D5), the 11 basic features (D1  X  D11) and the 17 basic features (D1  X  respectively. 5.3. Comparisons with SVM and MDC
A linear support sector machine (SVM) performs classi fi cation for the binary classes by constructing an N -dimensional hyper-plane to separate the data optimally into two categories. Asso-ciated with the underlying statistical learning theory, the SVM classi fi er provides a new approach to pattern recognition pro-blems, together with the regression estimation and linear operator inversion [ Bishop, 2006 ]. Fig. 9 presents the comparison using a certain number of basic features, D1  X  D17 (extracted from the
HRIFT) with the classi fi ers of SVM and MDC. From Fig. 9 , we can see that, compared with the performance with the MDC, an improved performance with the SVM ranging from 1.8% when using the 5 basic features (D1  X  D5) to 2.6% when using the 17 basic features (D1  X  D17). However, we observe that the highest rate of 89.6% obtained by using the 17 features (D1  X  D17) with the SVM is still lower than the rate of 92.6% by using the synthesized feature (see Table 2 ).

A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is commonly employed in medical decision systems. The areas below the ROC curves indicate the discrimination capabilities of the design systems ( Webb, 2002 ; Fawcett, 2006 ). In Fig. 10 , the synthesized feature achieves a sensitivity of 0.9 at a speci fi city of 0.95 under the ROC with an area of 0.961 (thick line), whereas the area for the performance of HRIFT using the 17 basic features (D1  X  D17 with the dashed line) is 0.932 at a speci fi city of 0.95 at a speci 0.92 with a sensitivity of 0.85. 6. Discussions
In real-time medical applications, it is important to design approaches that are able to discover useful information, which would be otherwise hidden, while maintaining the computational ef fi ciency of the technique ( Hortin et al., 2010 ). The approach, therefore, is able to provide many useful measurements in the histogram domain, such as intensity density, entropy, contrast, brightness, as well as simple and ef fi cient implementation.
Generally, the stages of OPMD can be described by the degree of INIs spread. Usually, a higher amount of INIs are correlated with aggressive OPMD, compared to the early-stage cases ( Blumen et al., 2009 ). Among the sick image cells, the spread of the pixel intensity of INIs within the HRIFT is variable, see Fig. 4 . This indicates that the texture derived from the HRIFT, associated with other clinical factors, could further serve as a stage detector for differentiating between early-stage (nonaggressive) and advanced (aggressive) OPMD. 7. Conclusion
In this study, we have shown that the HRIFT technique helps to constrain the problem space within the region of the color information, i. e., the slightly lighter INIs indicative of OPMD, regardless of image sizes, shapes and background structures. As a straight-forward extension of the HRIFT technique, the integrated technique of the achieves a higher accuracy score for detecting OPMD by an improved synthesized feature representation in a lower feature dimensionality.

The accuracy of an SVM model is mainly dependent on the selection of the model parameters. SVMs work well when there are only two target classes, but how do SVMs handle the case where the target variable has more than two classes? The challenge of it has been established [ Bishop, 2006 ]. In this paper, the approach is mainly concerned with differentiating between healthy and sick conditions regarding OPMD. In the future, by optimizing the SVMs parameter setting together, we plan to develop the method to diagnose three cases of healthy, nonag-gressive OPMD and aggressive OPMD in real-time clinical practice.
