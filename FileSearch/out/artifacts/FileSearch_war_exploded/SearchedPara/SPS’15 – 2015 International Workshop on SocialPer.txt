 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval X  Information filtering social personalization; social search &amp; navigation; recom-mender systems; user modeling
For the Social Personalization &amp; Search workshop 1 , we invite researchers working in the fields of Information Re-trieval, Personalization, User Modeling, and Recommender Systems where the social dimension plays a fundamental role. The workshop is examining several approaches that leverage the social side of the search process on two main contexts: (a) using social data for improving search and recommendations, and (b) search as a social process, collab-orative IR (e.g., [1, 4, 3, 2]).

On the first context, we expect to attract contributions that use the social dimension in different methods for per-sonalization and search, such as data from online social net-works, social tagging systems, online forums and community-based Q&amp;A. This topic is important because it involves leveraging new sources of information that are specific to social systems such as shared items and tags, user public profiles, online and offline social connections, and logs of user social activities in order to improve people X  X  informa-tion access in a wide variety of tasks and devices.

On the second context, the social dimension is emphasized as collaboration, so we aim to discuss works that consider information seeking as a collaborative activity. Here, re-searches can potentially use explicit social communication information (such as online, offline chat) to boost the per-sonalized search experience for each user, or in a community-http://socialcomputing.ing.puc.cl/sps2015/
