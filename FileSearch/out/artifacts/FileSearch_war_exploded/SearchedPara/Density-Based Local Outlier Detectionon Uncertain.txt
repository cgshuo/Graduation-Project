In these applications, outlier detection often is essential when analyzing uncertain data. In many real-world applications, determining whether the ob-ject is an outlier, not only its distance to neighbors is considered, but also the density of surrounding neighbors should be considered. As such density-based outlier detection can consid er local information [4].

Uncertain objects as referred to in this paper, by default, is in a d -dimensional numerical tuple. Given two uncertain instances u i and u j , the distance between these is denoted by d ( u i , u j ). In this paper, we employ the Euclidian distance metric, but the developed techniques can be easily extended to other distance metrics.

 Definition 1. Distance sum of k -neighbors: We assume that instance u j is of u i in W .Let dis k ( u i ) denote the distance sum of k-neighbors of instance u i in possible world W ,then Definition 2. Density of an instance: Let instances u j and u i be entities world W , the density of instance u i is defined as Definition 3. k-neighbor set of an instance: Let u i denote an instance of possible worlds, then Definition 4. Local Outlier Factor of an instance: Given that instance u denotes the LOF of instance u i .
 Definition 5. Local Outlier Factor of an uncertain object: Let u i denote denotes the LOF of u i . LOF ( u i ) is then defined as Definition 6. Density-based local outlier: When the uncertain objects are sorted in descending order based on their Local Outlier Factor, then the top-n uncertain objects are the density-based local outliers of the uncertain data set. In this section, we present an algorithm for Density-based Local Outlier detec-tion on Uncertain data ( UDLO ), which transforms the outlier definition into a probability problem. Density based outliers can be calculated based on the definition in a naive way by finding all k -neighbors in all possible worlds. This solution however is impractical as the number of possible worlds grows expo-nentially with the number of instances. To overcome this, we propose an exact algorithm to compute the density of an instance.
 Theorem 1.

If we assume that instance u j is a k -neighbor of u i ,then P k ( u j ) then the LOF is given by: We conducted several experiments on two real data sets and a synthetic data set to examine the efficiency and accuracy. In the remainder of this paper, these algorithms will be referred to as follows: outlier detection algorithm (denoted by UDLO ). For comparison, we implemented the outlier detection algorithms (denoted by BULOF and ULOF )whichareproposedin[7]. 3.1 Efficiency Efficiency is an important term frequentl y used in outlier detection studies. Fig-ure 1 shows the results on the two different datasets. As expected UDLO per-forms better than ULOF . Parameter n varies from 20 to 100, the running time increases as n increases. The running time of ULOF is much higher than UDLO algorithm. 3.2 Accuracy In this section, we give the experimenta l results on accuracy, as shown in Figure 3. Since of the outliers lie in the center of a cluster, it is hard for the ULOF algorithm to pick out this kind of objects from the entire dataset. The UDLO algorithm adheres more strictly to the outlier definition, and therefore the ac-curacy of UDLO algorithm is higher than that of ULOF . As expected, UDLO can deliver the best results on all datasets. Aggarwal, C.C. et al. [2] were the first to investigate the problem of outlier detection on uncer tain data. Wang et al. [8] focused on distance-based outlier detection on uncertain data, in which each data is affiliated with a confidence value. Jiang et al. [6] started with a comprehensive model considering both uncertain objects and their instances. I n Ref.[3] they attempted to find outliers by building a global classifier. However, it is difficult to build a clear boundary between normal data and abnormal data. Fan [5] proposed density-based top-k outlier detection algorithm on uncerta in objects. In their work, due to the distance between two objects is approxim ation, the density of object can not be accurate, so that affect th e detection results. In Liu et al. [7], the authors proposed a signed outlier detection algorithm based on local information (local density and local uncertainty level) on uncertain data. There are many important applications that require outlier detection on uncer-tain data. These applications always require that outlier are identified based on local information. We first derived an algorithm, which can effectively detect outliers without unfolding all possible worlds.
