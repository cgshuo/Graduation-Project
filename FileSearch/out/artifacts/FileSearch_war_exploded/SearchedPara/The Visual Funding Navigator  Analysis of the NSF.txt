 This paper presents an interactive visualization toolkit for navigat-ing and analyzing the National Science Foundation (NSF) funding information. Our design builds upon an improved 2.5D treemap layout and the stacked graph to contribute customized techniques for visually navigating and interacting with the hierarchical data of NSF programs and proposals. Furthermore, an incremental layout method is adopted to handle information on a large scale. The improved treemap visualization will help to vi-sually analyze the static funding related data and the stacked graph is utilized to analyze the time-series data. Through these visual analysis techniques, research trends of NSF, popular NSF programs are quickly identified.

Each year, NSF receives approximately 30,000 new or renewal support proposals. As the amount of information on the NSF web-site increases continually, decision-makers are often overwhelmed, something must be done to allow decision-makers to easily extract the information it contains. Information visualization is a powerful tool to help find the relations and trends of the data.

One interesting approach to presenting large volumes of data in a user-friendly manner is treemap visualization. The treemap visual-ization method, developed by Johnson and Shneiderman [2], maps hierarchical information to a set of nested rectangles whose areas correspond to some quantity (weight) in the data set. Treemaps are originally designed for visualizing a filled hard disk, now they have been successfully applied to a wide range of applications including financial analysis [4], software analysis [3, 1], etc. Another inter-esting approach is the stacked graph which is adopted by Martin Wattenberg in his NameVoyager [5]. This method is very effective for visual exploration of thousands of time series.

In this paper, we present the design of the visual funding nav-igator, a visualization system for exploring and analyzing online NSF funding data. The major feature of this navigator is that it pro-vides integrated support for static analysis and dynamic analysis. Treemap layout is adopted to analyze the static funding data. This analysis will help the user quickly discover the influential research organizations and projects in a particular topic area. Staked graph is utilized to dynamically analyze the time-series data. Such kind of dynamic analysis will help the user to track the NSF program trends, thus help the user to easily find the focus topic of interest.
Our visualization design builds upon the treemap layout and the stacked graph. Based on these visualization techniques, we con-tribute customized techniques for visually navigating and interact-ing with NSF Funding data, supporting visual analysis.
In this section, we propose a novel approach, 2.5D treemaps, to tree visualization. The 2.5D treemaps aim at highlighting the child-parent relations of the hierarchy without losing the ability of visu-alizing large data set within constrained space. The intuition is to make the depth of the tree an additional dimension. Since a full 3D representation would be computationally expensive and potentially difficult to navigate, we take advantage of a  X 2.5-Dimensional X  rep-resentation in which a  X  X eight X  coordinate is represented by an off-set factor. Figure 1 is an illustration of this basic idea.
Though the layout results are satisfactory, the improved layout algorithm described above is not efficient enough to be applied to huge data sets. To solve this problem, we designed an incremen-tal layout method, in which a simple level-of-detail calculation is adopted to handle information on a large scale. The basic idea of this method is that it will filter out low level nodes when the ar-eas assigned to the low level nodes are too small and treat their direct parent nodes as leaf nodes. Then the treemap layout method Figure 2: Visualization of the currently active awards on NSF website (31159 awards). described in Section 3.1 is utilized to map the filtered tree to the treemap first. Here, the weight of the parent node is the aggregation of the weights of its children. When the user clicks the node in this map, it will then smoothly zoom in to the selected node area, and the pseudo leaf node area are split again according to the weights of its children.
One major feature of this toolkit is that it provides hybrid anal-ysis that involves both static and dynamic analysis to help the user well understand the funding related information and reveal the re-search trend of NSF organization.
Static analysis will focus on analyzing the funding related hierar-chical data, which is organized by the NSF organization structure. In our treemaps of NSF funding data, the sizes of the leaf rectan-gles reflect the funding amounts of the awards. Thus such kind of treemaps provide a snapshot of the NSF funding distribution. The user can easily find
Figure 2 is the visualization result of the currently active awards (31159 awards) on NSF website. In this figure, the user can eas-ily find that MPS (Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sci-ences) and GEO (Directorate for Geosciences) are the two largest directorates in NSF, which offer more grants than other directorates. Thus the research areas they are funding are much more popular than other research areas.
In our toolkit, the staked graph [5] is utilized to dynamically analyze the time-series data embedded in the funding information, i.e., the time distribution of the funding amount for each of the 459 active NSF programs from 1992 to 2011.

The method to visualize the time-series data is as follow: given a set of the time distribution of the funding amount, a set of stacked graphs is produced, as in Figure 3. The x -axis corresponds to date, and the y -axis to the total funding amount for all the active pro-grams currently in view. Each stripe represents a program, and the thickness of a stripe is proportional to its funding amount at the given time step.

The above visualization method provides the following analysis capabilities: It allows the user to see and analyze the distribution of funding amount over time. The user can easily detect which pro-grams are the currently popular ones. For example, in Figure 3, programs  X  X uantitative Environmental Integrate Biology X ,  X  X ar-gins Program X ,  X  X cean Drilling Program X ,  X  X esearch Experiences for Undergraduates X , and  X  X ngineering Research Centers X  are the currently most popular programs. They received more funding in 2006.
In this paper, we present a visual funding navigator, which can help the user to navigate and analyze the funding data on the NSF official website. This toolkit allows the user to take the advantages of treemap visualization and stacked graph to understand the fund-ing related information more quickly. In future work, we are inter-ested in applying these techniques in a more traditional analytical context and conducting more rigorous evaluations.
