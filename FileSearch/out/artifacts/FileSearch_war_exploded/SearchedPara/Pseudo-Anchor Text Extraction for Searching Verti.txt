 This paper examines the problem of utilizing pseudo-anchor text to help ranking Web objects in vertical search. We adopt a machine learning based approach to extract pseudo-anchor text Experiments in academic search domain indicate that our approach is able to dramatically improve search performance. H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Search process; H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Retrieval models Algorithms, Experimentation Anchor extraction, Vertical s earch, Pseudo-URL, Pseudo-Anchor Modern search engines commonl y provide two categories of search functionalities to users: general Web search, and vertical search. With vertical search, we mean searching for a class of Web objects or information in a certain domain. Examples of vertical search include product search, image search, academic search, book search, people search , and others. Different from general Web search, vertical search commonly deals with information about certain types of real-world objects instead of general Web pages. Lots of current vertical search engines extract object information from the Web a nd provide indexing and search services for objects. For example, all the structured product data of the Windows Live Product Search (products.live.com) and a portion of the data in Froogle (froogle.google.com) are extracted from the Web, and ZoomInfo (www.zoominfo.com) extracts people information from multiple Web pages and integrates them. Anchor text plays a special important role in improving the performance of general Web sear ch. The importance of anchor text comes from the fact that it is fairly objective description for a Web page by potentially a large amount of other Web pages. To improve vertical search performance, anchor text would be useful if applied to vertical search as well. Borrowing the concepts of URL and anchor-text in general Web search, we may need to define the pseudo-anchor text for it by the contextual description around its pseudo-URL when this object is referenced (mentioned). Vertical objects typically lack explicit URLs to accurately identify them. And the anchor-text of a vertical object straightforward to extract and utilize pseudo-anchor text in vertical search. This paper proposes an approach to extract pseudo-anchor of vertical objects and utilize them in improving object ranking. One Web document may be describing multiple vertical objects, and the same object can appear in multiple documents. Our approach adopts a three-phase methodology to extract pseudo-anchors. In the first phase, for each time an object appearing in a document, we need to first identify an obj ect and then extract its related information as its candidate anchor block. Some entity extraction and surrounding text extraction work is related to this step. All candidate anchor blocks be longing to the same object are grouped in the second phase. As pseudo-URLs are often inaccurate descriptions of verti cal objects. Different pseudo-URLs may correspond to the same object. The challenge here is how to merge different pseudo-URLs of the same object in an effective way and with high accuracy. Data integration and high dimensional data clustering is related to this step. In the third phase, the ultimate pseudo-anchor text of each object is extracted by considering all ca ndidate blocks of the object. This is our focus in this paper. For objects of different types a nd in different domains, their candidate anchor blocks may share some common structures. Most candidate anchor blocks may be pieces of text with reference points (a reference point is one occurrence of an object in a document) within. Table 1 lists a paper object in academic search domain. Reference points are labeled by bold and italic text. The problem is: Given some candidate anchor blocks corresponding to an object, extract some text excerpts to best describe the object. We achieve this by adopting a machine-learning approach to learn a degree of belonging to anchor text for each term in the block set. Table 2 lists the features currently used for learning. IsInURL Whether the term appears in the pseudo-URL of the object. BlockLen Length of the candidate pseudo-anchor block Some of the above features should be normalized before they are used for learning. Please refer to [8] for more details. We demonstrate the effect of our approach in academic domain. All experiments are conducted based on Libra [5], our academic paper search system. We crawled and extracted 0.9 million paper objects from the Web, with nearly 0.4 million of them having full-text. Anchor text is extracted based on the 0.4 million papers. All the 0.9 million papers (with their anchor text) are indexed. We select 88 queries and, for each query, have labelers labeled the top relevance value from 1 ( X  X oor match  X ) to 5 ( X  X erfect match X ). We adopt nDCG (normalized DCG) [3] as a primary measure to evaluate search results. Table 3 shows the performance comparison between the results of a baseline paper ranking algorithm and the results of including pseudo-anchor text in ranking. The baseline algorithm considers the title, abstract, full-text and citation count of a paper. For each paper, we adopt the BM25 formula [6] over its text fields. And then the resulting score is linearly combined with the normalized citation count of the paper to get its final score. In addition, we compute an anchor score for each paper and linearly combine it with its baseline score (i.e. the score computed by the baseline algorithm). To compute the anchor score, a relevance score is computed for each anchor excerpt (still using BM25), and all the scores for the excerpts are combined by utilizing the homogeneous evidence combination technique [7]. Please refer to [8] for a detail description of experimental settings and results. 
Table 3. Comparison between the baseline approaches and our It was known in 1994 [4] that anchor text was useful to Web search. The idea of using contextual text in a certain vicinity of the anchor text was proposed in [1] to automatically compile some lists of authoritative Web resources on a range of topics. There has been some contextual de scription related work in some vertical search domains. In the academic search domain, Citeseer (http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu) [2] has been doing a lot of valuable work on citation recognition, refe rence matching, and contextual information displaying. Please refe r to our technique report [8] for a slightly detailed discussion of related work. We would like to thank Yunxiao Ma and Pu Wang for converting paper full-text from PDF to HTML format.
