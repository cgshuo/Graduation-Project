 Information Representation and Retrieval in the Digital Age. By Heting Chu. Assist Monograph Series 2003, ISBN 1-57387-172-9
Information Representation and Retrieval in the Digital Age is a detailed, yet non-technical, summary of information representation and retrieval methods and technologies. The author has taken great care to ex-plain the concepts and complexities of information representation and retrieval and to place them in the context of today  X  s digital environment.

The initial chapter ( X  X  X nformation Representation and Retrieval: An Overview) introduces the reader to the history of the field and important contributions and advances made in the field. The author also intro-duces the readers to information representation and information retrieval and the interconnection between these two concepts.

After this brief introduction, the next two chapters focus on information representation. Chapter 2 pro-vides a detailed description of the basic approaches to information representation X  X  X ndexing, categoriza-tion and summarization. The author compares and contrasts these approaches and discusses how these methods have been implemented. Chapter 3 discusses methods of information representation for digital information such as metadata, full text, and multimedia representation, the latter being presented in great detail. The author discusses the different implementations of each of these techniques, along with the chal-lenges and difficulties in the implementation.

Chapter 4 discusses the use of language in information representation and retrieval, and focuses on the two major methodologies, natural language and controlled vocabulary. The author discusses the different implementations of controlled vocabularies, such as thesauri, subject heading lists and classification schemes. Natural languages and controlled vocabularies are compared based on a number of issues such as synonyms and homographs. Finally, the author gives his opinion as to how controlled vocabularies can be used in the digital age.

Chapters 5 X 9 ( X  X  X etrieval techniques and Query Representation X  X ,  X  X  X etrieval Approaches X  X ,  X  X  X nforma-tion Retrieval Models X  X ,  X  X  X nformation Retrieval Systems X  X  and  X  X  X etrieval of Information Unique in Con-tent or Format X  X ) focus on information retrieval. Chapter 5 covers basic and advanced retrieval techniques, and the author evaluates the performance of each. This chapter also covers the topic of query representa-tion, the associated concepts, and the difficulties faced. Chapter 6 discusses two approaches to information retrieval, searching and browsing. The two approaches are defined and described in detail and the various strategies used in each approach are listed. The author describes the integration of the two approaches and also compares the two. Chapter 7 describes the various information retrieval models, and Chapter 8 covers various information retrieval systems, with particular emphasis given to Internet retrieval systems. The author describes Information Retrieval and Features of Internet Retrieval systems in great depth and cov-ers the evolution of Internet Retrieval Systems. Finally, Chapter 9 deals with the important issue of mul-tilingual and multimedia (e.g., image and audio) information.

Chapter 10 ( X  X  X he User Dimension in Information Representation and Retrieval X  X ) focuses on the inter-action between users and information systems, while Chapter 11 ( X  X  X valuation of Information Representa-tion and Retrieval X  X ) presents various criteria for evaluating information representations and retrieval systems.

The author describes the entire field from a high level perspective. Technicalities and implementation is-sues have been avoided to give the reader a broad theoretical grasp of the field. The book has been logically organized to show the relationship between information representation and information retrieval and to show how the latter depends on the former. Key concepts and techniques have been systematically explained.

The book covers the diversity of information types (e.g., image, sound, textual and multilingual infor-mation) with great clarity. The author clearly illustrates the difficulties associated with the organization of non-conventional information sources and the lack of a comprehensive and complete method of repre-senting such information relevantly.

Although the book title suggests a focus on  X  X  X he digital age, X  X  it lacks coverage of many recent innova-tions associated with search and retrieval on the World Wide Web. The author discusses the distributed nature of the Internet and difficulties associated with heterogeneous information types and representations.
However, the book does not cover the functioning of search engines such as Google, recommendation serv-ices, Web services, and other technologies that are redefining information retrieval on the Internet. More importantly, one could imagine devoting some time to explaining the quantity of information accessible through the World Wide Web and why that makes accurate and timely information retrieval methods crit-ical in the digital age.

Regardless, the book provides a strong introduction to the fundamentals of information retrieval. Many important topics are covered and explained clearly, making it a strong introductory text for undergraduate students along with those who want to become familiar with information retrieval techniques without get-ting into mathematical formalisms or implementation details. Readers can use the basic concepts in this book as background for deeper exploration of topics in more specialized texts.
 Designing Portals: Opportunities and Challenges. Edited by Ali Jafari and Mark Sheehan. Information Science Publishing, 2003, $67 ISBN 1-59140-108-9
Web-based portals are changing the way computer users access information. Growing from news and commercial information sites, portals offer a powerful way of connecting and presenting individualized con-tent to a user. Nowhere is this more evident than at institutions of higher learning, where portals provide the capability to present a wide range of content to the many audiences across a university. Deciding on what content to present, designing an interface, and addressing how the content can be accessed and by whom, offer unique challenges as portal designers are forced to coordinate applications and information
