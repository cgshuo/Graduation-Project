 1. Introduction
Negotiation is a common and important approach to resolve con fl icts and reach agreements between different parties in our daily life. With the advance and popularity of Web and e-com-merce, it is expected that a lot of previous negotiation activities between humans will be moved to electric platforms and greatly bene fi t from automated negotiation techniques ( Kersten and
Noronha, 1999 ). Automated negotiation techniques can, to a large extent, alleviate the efforts of human negotiators, and also aid human in reaching better negotiation outcomes by compensating for the limited computational abilities of humans when they are faced with complex negotiations. Until now, a lot of automated negotiation strategies and mechanisms have been proposed in different negotiation scenarios ( Faratin et al., 2003; Saha et al., 2005; Hindriks and Tykhonov, 2008; Jakub and Ryszard, 2006 ). is how to achieve optimal negotiation results given incomplete information on the negotiating partner. The negotiation partner usually keeps its negotiation strategy and its preference as its private information to avoid exploitations. A lot of research effort has been devoted to better understand the negotiation partner by either estimating the negotiation partner's preference pro ( Zeng and Sycara, 1998; Hindriks and Tykhonov, 2008; Coehoorn and Jennings, 2004 ) or predicting its decision function ( Zeng and
Sycara, 1996; Jakub and Ryszard, 2006 ). On one hand, with the aid of different preference pro fi le modeling techniques, the negotiating agents can get a better understanding of their negotiating partners and thus increase their chances of reaching mutually bene negotiation outcomes. On the other hand, effective strategy predic-tion techniques enable the negotiating agents to maximally exploit their negotiating partners and thus receive as much bene fi possible from negotiation. However, in most of previous work, the negotiating agents are usually assumed to be situated in a negotiation environment that strong limitations are put on the negotiation scenario or the negotiation opponent. For example, some work assumes ( Saha et al., 2005 ) that the agents negotiate over a single item only, however practical negotiation scenarios usually involve multiple items to negotiate over. There also exists some work that assumes that the negotiation agents can have access to their opponents' (partial) preferences. This can be unrea-listic especially in multi-issue negotiation scenarios in which the preferences of different agents may vary signi fi cantly, and the agents usually would not like to disclose their preferences to avoid being exploited. Another assumption commonly adopted ( Jakub and
Ryszard, 2006 ) is that the negotiation opponent is limited to choose from a speci fi c set of simple strategies, e.g., time-dependent or behavior-dependent tactics. Those strategies designed under this assumption may not work well against other negotiation partners with more complex state-of-the-art strategies.

To this end, in recent years a number of advanced negotiation strategies taking advantage of existing techniques have been proposed and agents employing these strategies have participated in automated negotiating agents competition ( ANAC )( Baarslag et al., 2010, 2013 ). The ANAC competition provides a negotiation plat-form which enables different negotiation agents to be evaluated against a wide range of opponents within a realistic negotiation environment. During the past three years, dozens of state-of-the-art negotiation strategies have been extensively evaluated in a variety of multi-issue negotiation scenarios and valuable insights have been obtained in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of different techniques, e.g., the ef fi cacy of different acceptance conditions ( Baarslag et al., 2011 ). It is still an open and interesting problem to design more ef fi cient automated negotiation strategies against a variety of negotiating opponents in different negotiation domains.
 In this paper, we propose an adaptive negotiation strategy
ABiNeS for automated agents to negotiate in bilateral multi-issue negotiation environments following the settings adopted in ANAC 2012 ( The Third International Automated Negotiating Agent
Competition, 2012 ). Bilateral multi-issue negotiations surround people's daily life and have received lots of attention in the negotiation literature. During negotiation, both the agents' nego-tiation strategies and preference pro fi les are their private informa-tion, and for each agent the only available information about the negotiating partner are its past negotiation moves. Considering the diversity of the available negotiation strategies that the negotiat-ing agents can adopt, it is usually very dif fi cult (or impossible) to predict which speci fi c strategy the negotiating partner is using based on this limited information. To effectively cope with different types of opponents, we introduce the concept of non-exploitation point  X  to adaptively adjust the degree that an ABiNeS agent exploits its negotiating opponent. The value of  X  is deter-mined by the characteristics of the negotiation scenario and the concessive degree of the negotiating partner, which is estimated based on the negotiation history. Besides, to maximize the possibility that the offer the ABiNeS agent proposes will be accepted by its negotiating partner, it can be useful to make predictions on the preference pro fi le of the negotiating partner.
Instead of explicitly modeling the negotiation partner's preference pro fi le, we propose a reinforcement-learning based approach to determine the optimal proposal for the negotiating partner based on the current negotiation history.

We evaluate the performance of the ABiNeS strategy compared with a number of state-of-the-art negotiation strategies from two different perspectives: ef fi ciency in terms of the average payoff obtained under a particular negotiation tournament and robust-ness in terms of how likely the agents have the incentive to adopt our strategy rather than other strategies. First, the ef fi evaluation is conducted under the negotiation tournament setting following ANAC 2012 using GENIUS 1 ( Lin et al., 2012 ) platform. Simulation results show that the ABiNes strategy can make more effective exploitations against a variety of negotiation partners and thus obtain higher average payoffs during negotiation tourna-ments and it is worth mentioning that the ABiNes strategy wins the champion of ANAC 2012 known as CUHKAgent . Second, we give a detailed analysis of the ABiNes strategy by investigating the in fl uence of its two major novel components. Through the detailed analysis, we aim at providing a clear understanding of why the ABiNes strategy can win the champion of ANAC 2012, and more importantly, offering valuable insights for the automated negotia-tion community for the future negotiation strategy design. Third, we propose adopting the single-agent best deviation principle to analyze the robustness of different negotiation strategies based on model checking techniques. According to the robustness analysis, the ABiNes strategy is shown to be very robust against other state-of-the-art strategies under different negotiation contexts.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , we give a description of negotiation model we consider in this paper. In Section 3 , the negotiation strategy ABiNes we propose is introduced. In Section 4 ,wegivedetailedevaluationofthe negotiation ef fi ciency and robustness of ABiNes compared with the state-of-the-art negotiation strategies under different negotiation contexts. An overview of related work on automated negotiation strategies is given in Section 5 .Lastlyconclusionandfuturework are given in Section 6 . 2. Negotiation model
In this section, we describe the negotiation model we consider in this work, which follows the settings adopted in ANAC 2012 ( The Third International Automated Negotiating Agent Competition, 2012 ). We focus on bilateral negotiations, i.e., negotiations between two agents. Speci fi cally, the alternating-offers protocol is adopted to regulate the interactions between the negotiating agents, in which the agents take turns to exchange proposals. For each negotiation scenario, both agents can negotiate over multiple issues (items), and each item can have a number of different values. Let us denote the set of items as M , and the set of values for each item m We de fi ne a negotiation outcome  X  as a mapping from every item m
A M to a value v A V i , and the negotiation domain is de the set  X  of all possible negotiation outcomes. For each negotiation outcome  X  ,weuse  X   X  m i  X  to denote the corresponding value of the item m i in the negotiation outcome  X  .Weassumethattheknowl-edge of the negotiation domain is known to both agents before-hand, and is not changed during the whole negotiation session.
For each negotiation outcome  X  , different agents may have different preferences. Here we assume that each agent i 's pre-ference can be modeled by a utility function u i such that 8 is mapped into a real-valued number in the range of [0,1], i.e., u  X   X   X  A  X  0 ; 1 . In practical negotiation environments, it is usually associated with certain cost in each negotiation. To take this factor into consideration, a real-time deadline is imposed on the nego-tiation process and each agent's actual utilities over the negotia-tion outcomes are decreased by a discounting factor  X  over time. Following the setting adopted in ANAC'12, each negotiation ses-sion is allocated 3 min, which is normalized into the range of [0,1], i.e., 0 r t r 1. Formally, if an agreement is reached at time t before the deadline, each agent i 's actual utility function U t mutually agreed negotiation outcome  X  is de fi ned as follows:
U  X   X   X  X  u
If no agreement is reached by the deadline, each agent i will obtain the negotiation scenario. The agents will also obtain their corre-sponding reservation values if the negotiation is terminated before the deadline. Note that the agents' actual utilities over their reservation values are also discounted by the discounting factor over time t . We assume that the agents' preference information and their reservation values are private and cannot be accessed by their negotiating partners.

The interaction between the negotiation agents is regulated by the alternating-offers protocol, in which the agents are allowed to take turns to exchange proposals. During each encounter, if it is agent i 's turn to make a proposal, it is allowed to make a choice from the following three options:
Reject and propose a counter-offer to its negotiating partner :
Overall, the negotiation process terminates when either of the following conditions is satis fi ed: (1) the deadline is reached ( End ); (2) an agent chooses to terminate the negotiation before reaching deadline ( Terminate ); (3) an agent chooses to accept the negotia-tion outcome proposed by its negotiating partner ( Accept ).
For each negotiation session between two agents A and B , let
A -B denote the negotiation outcome proposed by agent A to agent B at time t . Naturally a negotiation history H t A 2 B agent A and B until time t can be represented as follows:
H where t k r t l for k r l , i.e., the negotiation outcomes are ordered over time, and also t n r t . p k  X  p k  X  2 A f A ; B g , i.e., the negotiation process strictly follows the alternating-offers protocol.

Similarly, we denote the negotiation history during a certain period of time (between time t 1 and t 2 )as H t 1 -t 2 A 2 B mentioned, we know that a negotiation session between two agents A and B will terminate either when one agent chooses an action from the set f Accept ; Terminate g , or the deadline is reached.
Thus the last element of a complete negotiation history can be either one of the elements from the set S  X f Accept ; Terminate
A negotiation history by time t is active if its last element is not equal to any element in S . 3. ABiNeS : an adaptive bilateral negotiating strategy
ABiNeS in detail. For the ease of description, we refer to the ABiNeS agent as agent A and its negotiating partner as agent B in the following descriptions. The ABiNeS strategy mainly consists of four basic decision components. The fi rst component is Acceptance-Threshold (AT) component and it is responsible for determining the
ABiNeS agent's minimum acceptance threshold l A t at time t . The second component is Next-Bid (NB) component whose function is to determine the negotiation outcome x t A -B that the ABiNeS agent proposes at time t . The third component, Acceptance-Condition (AC) component, is used for determining whether to accept the current proposal from agent B or not. Given a negotiation history
H t A 2 B , its acceptance threshold l A t , and its negotiation outcome x t A -B to propose at time t , the AC component returns a boolean value indicating whether to accept the offer or not, which is
Condition (TC) component. It is responsible for determining whether to terminate the current negotiation or not. Similar to the AC component, given a negotiation history H t A 2 B , its accep-tance threshold l A t , its negotiation outcome x t A -B t , and its reservation utility ru A 0 , the TC component returns a boolean value indicating whether to terminate the negotiation or not, which is denoted as TC  X  H t A 2 B ; l t A ; x t A -B
Algorithm 1. Overall fl ow of the ABiNeS strategy. 21: Propose the negotiation outcome x t A -B to the 22: end if 23: end if 24: end for
The overall description of the negotiation strategy ABiNeS based on the above basic elements is presented in Algorithm 1 . At time t the acceptance threshold and the next-round negotiation outcome are calculated fi rst based on the AT and NB components respec-tively. If the ABiNeS agent is the fi rst one to make a proposal, then it is faced with two options: either proposing a negotiation outcome to agent B or terminating the negotiation (Lines 2
Otherwise, the ABiNeS agent makes a choice among three options: proposing a negotiation outcome to agent B , choosing to terminate the negotiation and accepting the offer from agent B (Lines 10
The decisions on whether to accept the offer or terminate the negotiation are determined by the AC and TC components respec-tively. We introduce each decision component in detail in the following sections. 3.1. Acceptance-threshold (AT) component
The AT component is responsible for determining the accep-tance threshold l of the ABiNeS strategy during negotiation. The value of the acceptance threshold re fl ects the agent's current concession degree and should be adaptively adjusted based on the past experience and the characteristic of the negotiation environment. Besides, it also has explicit in fl uence on the decision-making process of the other three components, which will be introduced later.

We assume that the negotiating partner is myopic self-inter-ested, and it will accept any proposal when the deadline is approaching  X  t 1  X  . 3 Therefore the acceptance threshold of an
ABiNeS agent should be always higher than the highest utility it can obtain when t  X  1. Speci fi cally, at any time t , the acceptance threshold l t of the ABiNeS agent should not be lower than u max where u max is its maximum utility over the negotiation domain without discounting. Since the negotiating goal is to reach an agreement which maximize the agent's own utility as much as possible, its negotiating partner should be exploited as much as possible by setting its acceptance threshold as high as possible.
On the other hand, due to the discounting effect, the actual utility the agent receives can become extremely low though its original utility over the mutually agreed negotiation outcome is high, if it takes too long for the agents to reach the agreement. In the worst case the negotiation may end up with a break-off and each agent obtains zero utility. Thus we also need to make certain compro-mises to the negotiating partner, i.e., lower the acceptance thresh-old, depending on the type of the partner we are negotiating with.
Therefore, the key problem is how to balance the trade-off between exploiting and making compromise to the negotiating partner. Towards this end, we introduce the adaptive non-exploitation point  X  , which represents the speci fi c time when we should stop exploitations on the negotiating partner. This value is adaptively adjusted based on the behavior of the negotiating partner. Speci fi cally we propose that for any time t o  X  agent always exploits its negotiating partner (agent B ) by setting its acceptance threshold to a value higher than u max  X  1 approaching this value until time  X  according to certain pattern of behavior. After time  X  , its acceptance threshold is set to be equal to u max  X  1 t forever, and any proposal over which its utility is higher than this value will be accepted. Formally, the acceptance thresh-old l A t of an ABiNeS agent at time t is determined as follows:  X  where the variable  X  controls the way the acceptance threshold approaches u max  X  1 t (boulware  X   X  4 1  X  , conceder  X   X   X   X  1  X  ). One example showing the dynamics of the acceptance threshold with time t with different value of  X  is given in Fig. 1 .
The remaining question is how to calculate the value of non-exploitation point  X  . The value of  X  is determined by the char-acteristics of the negotiation scenario (i.e., discounting factor and the concession degree of the negotiating partner. The smaller the discounting factor  X  is, the less actual utility we will receive as time goes by, which means more risk we are facing when we continue exploiting the negotiating partner. Therefore the value of should be decreased with the decreasing of the discounting factor  X  . The concession degree of the negotiating partner is estimated based on its past behaviors. Intuitively, the more number of new negotiation outcomes that the negotiating partner has recently proposed, the more it is willing to make concession to end the negotiation. Speci fi cally, the negotiation partner's con-cessive degree s t is de fi ned as the ratio of new negotiation outcomes it proposed within the most recent fi nite negotiation ing more concessive, we can take advantage of this prediction by postponing the time we stop exploitations, i.e., increasing the value of  X  .

Initially the value of  X  is determined by the discounting factor only since we do not have any information on the negotiating partner yet. After that, it is adaptively adjusted based on the estimation of the concession degree of the negotiating partner. The overall adjustment rule of  X  during negotiation is shown in Fig. 2 . 3.2. Next-bid (NB) component
The next-bid component is responsible for determining the negotiation outcome to be proposed to the negotiating partner. Given the current acceptance threshold l A t at time t , any negotia-tion outcome over which the ABiNeS agent's utility is higher than l can be a reasonable outcome to propose. To maximize the likelihood that the offer will be accepted by agent B , we need to predict the negotiation outcome  X  max which can maximize its utility among the set C of candidate negotiation outcomes (i.e.,
C  X f  X   X  u A  X   X   X  Z l t A g ). The negotiation outcome  X  max by the NB component as the offer to be proposed to agent B .
To obtain  X  max , we need to estimate agent B 's private pre-ference based on its past negotiation moves. Different approaches ( Hindriks and Tykhonov, 2008; Faratin et al., 2003; Coehoorn and
Jennings, 2004; Zeng and Sycara, 1998 ) have been proposed to explicitly estimate the negotiating partner's utility function in bilateral negotiation scenarios. To make the estimation feasible with the limited information available, we usually need to put some restrictions on the possible structures that the negotiation partner's utility function can have ( Hindriks and Tykhonov, 2008 ) or assume that the preference pro fi le of the negotiation partner is chosen from a fi xed set of pro fi les ( Zeng and Sycara, 1998 ). Instead of estimating agent B 's utility function directly, here we adopt a model-free reinforcement learning based approach to predict the current best negotiation outcome for agent B . The only assumption we need here is that the negotiating partner (agent B ) is indivi-dually rational and follows some kind of concession-based strat-egy when proposing bids, which is the most commonly used assumption in both game-theoretic approaches and negotiations ( Osborne and Rubinstein, 1994; Hindriks and Tykhonov, 2008 ).
Based on the above assumption, it is natural to assume that the sequence of past negotiation outcomes proposed by agent B should be in accordance with the decreasing order of its pre-ference over those outcomes. Intuitively, for a value v i m , the earlier and the more frequent it appears in the negotiation outcomes of the past history, the more likely that it weighs more in contributing to the negotiation partner's overall utility. There-fore, for each value of each item m i in the negotiation domain, we keep record of the number of times that it appears in the negotiating partner's past negotiation outcomes and update its value each time a new negotiation outcome  X  0 is proposed by agent B as follows: n  X  agent B ,  X  is the discounting factor re fl ecting the decreasing speed of the relative importance of the negotiation outcomes as time increases, and k is the number of times that the value  X  0  X  m item m i has appeared in the history.
 frequency f  X   X   X  as the criterion for evaluating the relative pre-ference of agent B over it. The value of f  X   X   X  is determined by the value of n  X   X   X  m i  X  X  for each item m i A M based on the current negotiation history. Formally, for any negotiation outcome accumulated frequency f  X   X   X  is calculated as follows: f  X   X   X  X   X   X  -greedy exploration mechanism. With probability 1  X  chooses the negotiation outcome with the highest f -value from the set C of candidate negotiation outcomes, and chooses one negotiation outcome randomly from C with probability  X  . The value of  X  controls the exploration degree during prediction. One exception is that the negotiation outcome  X  max will be selected as the best negotiation outcome proposed by the negotiating agent B in the history if the NB component has received the corresponding signal from the AC component, and this will be explained in detail in the next section. 3.3. Acceptance-condition (AC) component tance threshold l A t , and its negotiation outcome x t A -B time t , the AC component determines whether to accept the current proposal of agent B or not. The overall acceptance condi-tions are described in Algorithm 2 . The ABiNeS agent accepts the proposal  X  1 from its negotiating agent B if its utility over either higher than its current acceptance threshold l A t
Otherwise, it checks whether there exists some negotiation outcome above condition. If the answer is yes, then it will notify the NB component to propose  X  best next time (Lines 4  X  5).

Algorithm 2. Acceptance conditions AC  X  H t A 2 B ; l t A 1: Initialization:  X  best  X  BestNegotiationOutcome  X  H t A 2 B let  X  1 be the negotiation outcome proposed by agent B obtained from H t A 2 B . 2: if u A  X   X  1  X  4 l t A then 3: accept the offer (return true). 4: else if u A  X   X  best  X  4 l t A then 5: not accept (return false) and notify the NB component to propose the negotiation outcome  X  best next time. 6: else 7: not accept (return false). 8: end if 3.4. Termination-condition (TC) component
This component is responsible for deciding whether to termi-nate the negotiation and receive the corresponding reservation value or not. Here we treat the reservation value as an alternative offer from the negotiating agent B with a constant utility ru the termination conditions of TC component are similar to the acceptance conditions except that u A  X   X  1  X  is replaced with the reservation value ru A 0 . The only difference is that we do not need to check the best negotiation outcome proposed by agent B in the history since the reservation value is unchanged throughout the negotiation session. The detailed mechanism for TC component is shown in Algorithm 3 .

ABiNeS strategy against the state-of-the-art negotiation agents across a wide range of multi-issue negotiation scenarios in the tournament setting following previous evaluation criteria (i.e., ef fi ciency and robustness) ( Baarslag et al., 2010; The Second International Automated Negotiating Agent Competition, 2011; The
Third International Automated Negotiating Agent Competition, 2012 ) under the GENIUS (General Environment for Negotiation with
Intelligent multi-purpose Usage Simulation) ( Lin et al., 2012 )plat-form. The reason why the ABiNeS strategy can negotiate more ef fi ciently compared with other state-of-the-art strategies are also investigated in detail, which hopefully can reveal some insights for the automated negotiation community. GENIUS is a negotiation platform of ANAC ( Baarslag et al., 2010, 2013; The Third
International Automated Negotiating Agent Competition, 2012 ) developed for facilitating research on bilateral multi-issue negotia-tions and allowing different negotiation agents to be evaluated in practical environments. All the requirements described in the negotiation model in Section 2 are supported in GENIUS. 4.1. Experimental settings 4.1.1. Negotiation agents
The ABiNeS strategy is evaluated against the state-of-the-art negotiation strategies participated in ANAC 2012 ( The Third International Automated Negotiating Agent Competition, 2012 ). The ABiNeS strategy is implemented as CUHKAgent and has participated the ANAC'12 competition. In this work we evaluate its performance 4 against the state-of-the-art negotiation strategies which enters the fi nal round of ANAC 2012 ( The Third International Automated Negotiating Agent Competition, 2012 ): AgentLG , OMACAgent ( Chen and Weiss, 2012 ), TheNegotiatior Reloaded , BRAMAgent2 , Meta-Agent , IAMHaggler2012 ( Williams et al. 2012a,b ), and AgentMR . These negotiation agents are designed by different research groups independently and each agent has no information about other agents' strategies before-hand. Each agent can only learn about other agents' information within a single negotiation encounter and all information learned at previous negotiation encounter will be erased at the beginning of the next encounter by the GENIUS platform. The detailed implementations of all negotiation strategies are available at The Third International Automated Negotiating Agent Competition (2012) . 4.1.2. Domains
The negotiation domains are designed by different research groups and are targeted at modeling practical multi-issue negotia-tion scenarios in uncertain and open environments. The domains are different from each other in terms of the number of issues, opposition ( Baarslag et al., 2013 ), discounting factor, reservation values and so on. Opposition is used for re fl ecting the competi-tiveness degree of the negotiation domain between the negotia-tion parties, which is de fi ned as the minimum distance from all the negotiation outcomes to the point representing complete satisfaction of both negotiation parties (1, 1). During negotiations, each agent can only have access to its own preference over all possible negotiation outcomes and has no information about its opponent's preference.

The basic set of the negotiation scenarios consists of 24 different domains submitted by the past participants in previous ANAC competitions. The discounting factor and reservation value can be set to different values within the range of  X  0 ; 1 , which may greatly in fl uence the performance of negotiation strategies. There-fore, for each negotiation domain from the basic set, three variants are also generated with different discounting factors and reserva-tion values, which thus results in a total of 72 domains ( The Third International Automated Negotiating Agent Competition, 2012 ). The size and opposition degree (competitiveness degree) of the 24 domains are distributed equally. Speci fi cally, there are 8 small-size domains, 8 medium-size domains and 8 large-size domains, and there are 8 domains with high, medium and low opposition respectively. The details of the domains can be found in Williams et al. (2014) and The Third International Automated Negotiating Agent Competition (2012) . 4.1.3. Parameter setting of the ABiNeS strategy
The parameter setting of the ABiNeS strategy is given in Table 1 , which follows the setting used in the CUHKAgent implementation. Note that the parameter  X  is set to different values depending on the value of the discounting factor  X  of the current domain.
If  X  4 0 : 75, then  X   X  1.8; if 0 : 75 4  X  4 0 : 5, then  X   X  1.5; if 0 then  X   X  1.2. 4.2. Experimental results under tournament
In this section, we present the evaluation results over all domains, discounted domains and undiscounted domains. For each negotiation domain, each negotiation agent negotiates with all other seven agents (excluding itself) for 10 times on both sides in order to produce statistically signi fi cant results. All the results described in this paper are adopted from the of fi cial fi results of ANAC 2012 ( Results of The Third International
Automated Negotiating Agent Competition, 2012 ). We only high-light the overall results comparison and more detailed results can be found at the ANAC 2012 website ( Results of The Third
International Automated Negotiating Agent Competition, 2012 ). 4.2.1. Performance over all domains
The second column in Table 2 shows the overall ranking of the eight negotiation agents in terms of overall received utilities and variances averaged over all the 72 domains. We can see that our agent ABiNeS achieves the highest average score of 0.626478, ranking the fi rst place. AgentLG ranks the second place with the average score of 0.621981, which is slightly lower than that of the
ABiNeS agent. Both the OMACAgent and TheNegotiator Reloaded rank the third place since there is no statistically signi difference between their scores. 4.2.2. Performance over discounted and undiscounted domains
When the discounting effect is considered into the negotiation process, the agents need to make careful trade-off between exploiting and concession to the opponent. For the same domain, the negotiation outcomes when the discounting factor is consid-ered are usually signi fi cantly different than those cases with no discounting effects. To this end, we further evaluate the negotia-tion performance of our ABiNeS agent against others under discounted and undiscounted domains.

The third column in Table 2 shows the scores of each negotia-tion agent averaged over all discounted domains. We can see that our ABiNeS agent achieves the highest average utility among all agents. We hypothesize that it is because our ABiNeS agent can adapt its negotiation decision more ef fi ciently with respect to different discounting factors in terms of balancing between exploiting and concession to the opponent compared with others. Besides, it is worth noticing that the ranks of the BRAMAgent2 and
TheNegotiator Reloaded are reversed compared with the previous results averaged over all domains. This may indicated that BRA-
MAgent2 agent can make better adaptation to different discount-ing factors than TheNegotiator Reloaded agent under discounted domains.
 domains and the scores of all agents averaged over all undiscounted domains are shown in the last column of Table 2 .Wecanseethat there are signi fi cant changes among the relative ranking of the agents. TheNegotiator Reloaded agent ranks the fi rst place while our
ABiNeS agent ranks the second place. Under undiscounted domains, it is much easier for agents to make decisions since there is no discounting effect on their actual received utilities as time passes.
It is usually expected that the less concessive an agent is, the more utility that it will obtain under undiscounted domains. Accordingly, the overall ranking of the agents under undiscounted domains can largely re fl ect their relative concession degrees. 4.3. Detailed analysis of ABiNeS strategy strategy against other state-of-the-art strategies under different negotiation domains. However, it is still unclear which decision-making component contributes to the superior negotiation ef ciency of the ABiNeS strategy. Having a better understanding of this question can not only enable us to make further improvement of our strategy, but also make it possible for other researchers to incorporate the decision-making components of our strategy into their negotiation strategy design appropriately.
 nents inside our strategy as follows, which we believe make the most contributions to the overall negotiation performance of the
ABiNeS strategy: 1. The adaptive adjustment of the non-exploitation point  X  2. The two-stage way in which the acceptance threshold l A determined.

During negotiations, on one hand, each rational agent would like to obtain as much payoff as possible by exploiting its negotiation partners; on the other hand, due to the discounting effect and time constraints, it is also necessary to make certain compromise to the negotiation partners to avoid obtaining very low utilities in the end (possibly caused by a break-off or high discounting effect). The concession degree should depend on both the characteristic of the negotiation domain and the type of the partner we are negotiating with. Therefore, one key problem during negotiation is how to balance the trade-off between exploiting and making compromise to the negotiating partner.
In ABiNeS , the adaptive non-exploitation point  X  is introduced which represents the speci fi c time when we should stop exploita-tions on the negotiating partner. The value of  X  is adaptively adjusted based on the estimated behavior of the negotiating partner (i.e., its concession degree).

We hypothesize that the adaptive adjustment of  X  can help us to better exploit different negotiation opponents, and thus improve the overall utility obtained through negotiation.
To evaluate its in fl uence on the overall negotiation performance of ABiNeS strategy, we compare the performance of the original
ABiNeS strategy with the modi fi ed ABiNeS strategy in which the adaptive adjustment of  X  is removed (denoted as ABiNeS 0 ). The second column in Table 3 shows the average utilities obtained by both strategies against other seven state-of-the-art strategies in
ANAC 2012 in different domains. To make the evaluation results more general, for each domain the simulations are performed over four instances of the domains with different discounting factors (  X  1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25). All results are average over 100 times. From the second column in Table 3 , we can see that ABiNeS strategy can always obtain a higher average utility than ABiNeS 0 in all negotia-tion domains. The results thus successfully verify our hypothesis of the usefulness of adaptively adjusting the value of  X  based on the estimated behavior of the opponent. For the eight negotiation strategies participated in the tournament, each of them makes concessions during negotiation in various ways. Some of them (e.g., AgentLG) are more aggressive in exploiting the opponents while the rest (e.g., IAMHaggler2012) are less aggressive. In this context, the capability of adaptively predicting the concession degree of different negotiation opponents and making informed move (exploiting more or make more concession) accordingly enables the ABiNeS agent to make ef fi cient exploitation against different opponents. Speci fi cally, the ABiNeS agent is able to make more exploitation to gain more utility against mild opponents and make concession quickly to avoid low utility against tough opponents. Thus it is expected that ABiNeS strategy can obtain higher average utility than ABiNeS 0 strategy under different nego-tiation domains, which is con fi rmed by the simulation results shown in the second column in Table 3 .

Next we evaluate the in fl uence of the second component, the two-stage way in which the acceptance threshold l A t is determined, on the negotiation ef fi ciency of the ABiNeS strategy. The two-stage determination of the acceptance threshold works as follows: in the fi rst stage  X  t r  X   X  , the ABiNeS agent always makes gradual conces-sion to its opponent following certain pattern of behavior but always maintain its acceptance threshold higher than the pre-determined value u max  X  1 t ; in the second stage  X  t 4  X  any proposal in which its discounted utility is no less than u max The rationale behind is that we assume that the opponents are always rational in that any positive proposal would be accepted by the opponent at the very last moment of the negotiation, therefore the worst case is that ABiNeS agent obtains the utility of u max proposing u max at the very last moment of the negotiation to its opponent and the proposal is accepted.

We hypothesize that this assumption is essential in guarantee-ing that the ABiNeS agent would not be exploited signi fi its opponent during negotiation, and it is expected that the minimum utility u max  X  can always be obtained no matter how aggressive the opponent is. To evaluate the in fl uence of this assumption on the negotiation ef fi ciency of the ABiNeS strategy, we compare the average utility of the original ABiNeS strategy against the state-of-the-art strategies with the modi fi ed version in which this assumption is removed (denoted as ABiNeS  X  X  ). The last column in Table 3 shows the expected utilities obtained by both strategies against other seven state-of-the-art strategies in ANAC 2012 over different domains. Similar with the setting of previous part, for each domain we consider four instances of the domains with different discounting factors (  X   X  1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25). All results are average over 100 times. From the last column in Table 3 ,we can clearly see that ABiNeS agent is able to obtain higher average utility than ABiNeS  X  X  agent in all negotiation domains, which thus veri fi es the importance of adopting this assumption in improving as shown in Fig. 1 , the agent's acceptance threshold is usually increased gradually after the time  X  , while in contrast, the ABiNeS agent without the second assumption would just accept any proposal whose utility is higher than u max  X  1  X  after the time Therefore, we can see that the ABiNeS agent is able to gain more utility from negotiations by exploiting the assumption that the opponents are usually rational in that they would accept any positive proposal at the very last moment of the negotiation. 4.4. The empirical game theoretic analysis of robustness
The evaluation criterion adopted in Section 4.2 re fl ects the negotiation performance of different strategies in terms of average scores achieved within a fi xed tournament setting. However, it does not reveal much information about the robustness of the negotiation strategies in different negotiation scenarios, since it assumes that each agent's strategy is fi xed beforehand. For example, we may be interested to know whether an agent adopting our strategy ABiNeS has the incentive to unilaterally deviate to other strategies under a particular negotiation tourna-ment. Would any agent adopting other strategies be willing to switch to our strategy under different tournaments?
To answer the above questions, we adopt the game-theoretic approach to analyze the robustness of our strategy under different negotiation settings. Since there exists an in fi nite number of possible negotiation strategies that the agents may take, we cannot apply the standard game-theoretic approach to perform such an analysis by explicitly considering all possible strategies.
Therefore, in this paper we adopt the tool of empirical game theoretic (EGT) analysis to achieve this goal instead, which is originally developed by Wellman et al. (2005) to analyze the
Trading Agent Competition. EGT analysis is a game-theoretic analysis approach based on a set of empirical results. It handles the problem of the existence of in fi nite possible strategies by assuming that each agent only selects its strategy from a of strategies and the outcomes for each strategy pro fi le can be determined through empirical simulations. This technique has been successfully applied in addressing questions about robust-ness of different negotiation strategies in ANAC 2011 ( Baarslag et al., 2013 ). However, previous robustness analysis is based on the principle of best single-agent deviation, where only the agent with the maximum deviation pro fi t among all participating agents can deviate from its current strategy. However, this assumption may not be able to re fl ect the realistic scenarios, since each participat-ing agent usually represents different parties and makes decision independently. Each participating agent usually has its own free-dom to choose whether to deviate from its current strategy or not.
To this end, we propose adopting the principle of single-agent best deviation to perform the robustness analysis based on EGT analysis, where each agent is allowed to deviate from its current strategy in a rational way. Therefore, each participating agent has equal opportunity to choose whether it would deviate from its current strategy or not. We apply the EGT analysis to the bilateral negotiation setting as follows.
 In our EGT analysis, we consider a fi xed set S  X f C ; L ; ;
R ;
B ; M ; I ; A g 5 of negotiation strategies consisting of the top eight strategies from this year's ANAC competition. Different from the setting of ANAC, each agent is free to select any strategy from this set as its negotiation strategy. For each bilateral negotiation, the corresponding payoff received for each participating agent is determined as its average payoff over all possible domains against its opponent, which can be obtained through empirical simula-tions. The detailed payoff matrix for all possible bilateral negotia-tions is given in Table 4 . Note that for each strategy pro the row player's payoff is given since the game itself is agent-symmetric. Based on the bilateral negotiation outcomes in Table 4 , it is easy for us to construct the negotiation outcomes (the corresponding payoff pro fi les) for any possible negotiation tourna-ment among multiple agents. The average payoff of an agent in any given tournament can be determined by averaging its payoff obtained in all bilateral negotiations against all other agents participated in the tournament.

Given a negotiation tournament consisting of n agents, each agent chooses one particular strategy from the set S of strategies, which jointly constitutes a strategy pro fi le. An agent has the incentive to deviate its current strategy to another one if and only if its payoff after deviation can be statistically signi fi improved, provided that all the other agents keep their strategies unchanged. There may exist multiple candidate strategies that an agent has the incentive to deviate to, but here we only consider the best deviation available to that agent in terms of maximizing its deviation bene fi t. Following previous work ( Baarslag et al., 2013 ), given a pure strategy pro fi le under a negotiation tournament, if no agent has the incentive to unilaterally deviate from its current strategy, then this strategy pro fi le is called a empirical pure strategy Nash equilibrium . Another concept for analyzing the stability of the strategy pro fi les is best reply cycle ( Yong,1993 ), which is a subset of strategy pro fi les in which, for any strategy pro fi le within this subset, there is no single-agent best deviation path leading to any strategy pro fi le outside the cycle. cycle can be considered as two different interpretations of empiri-cal stable sets to evaluate the stability of different strategy pro
The basin of attraction of a stable set is de fi ned as the percentage of strategy pro fi les which can lead to this stable set through a series of single-agent best deviations. Accordingly, the robustness of a strategy is evaluated based on the basin of attraction of the stable set that belongs to Baarslag et al. (2013) . Given two strategies s and strategy s is more robust than strategy s 0 . 6 following two negotiation contexts: 1994 ) to perform EGT analysis by automatically identifying both empirical pure strategy Nash equilibrium and best reply cycle , and also determining the basin of attraction of the above two stable sets. Since the model checking technique is not the focus of the paper, we only show the robustness analysis results in the following part. Interested readers may refer to Hao and Song for details of how to apply model checking to perform robustness analysis. 4.4.1. Bilateral negotiations among eight possible strategies agents  X j P j X  2  X  and a set S  X f C ; L ; O ; R ; B ; M ;
Each agent can choose any strategy from the set S during negotiation. In general there exist a total of j S j j P j possible strategy pro fi les. However, since the bilateral negotiation itself is symmetric (e.g., a negotiation in which agent p strategy C and agent p 2 uses strategy L is equivalent with the case that their strategies are swapped.), we can simply reduce the number of strategy pro fi les from 64 to  X  j P j X j S j 1 j S j 1 indicates that the number of states of the MDP model generated by PAT for performing EGT analysis can be reduced from 64 to 36, which can help in reducing the veri fi cation time of PAT.
According to the veri fi cation results of PAT ( Hao and Song ), we fi nd that under bilateral negotiations, there is no empirical pure strategy Nash equilibrium and there exists only one best reply cycle , this cycle is 100%, i.e., for all possible initial strategy pro always exist a single-agent best deviation path which can lead to one of the strategy pro fi les within this cycle. Our strategy ABiNeS is contained in two strategy pro fi les (  X  C ; R  X  and  X  C ;
This indicates that our strategy ABiNeS is very robust against other strategies since it is always possible that the agents will be willing to adopt our strategy ABiNeS no matter what their initial strategy is in the long run.

Fig. 3 shows an example of the dynamics of how each agent may change its strategy between different negotiation tourna-ments under bilateral negotiations among eight strategies, which is generated automatically by the model checker PAT. In Fig. 3 , each node (state) is associated with a unique number representing a unique bilateral negotiation setting (strategy pro fi le) except node 1 which, as the initial state, consists of all the possible bilateral negotiation settings in which both agents choose the same strategy. The strategy pro fi le for each state is given by the label of its outgoing transitions. Each transition between any pair of nodes (states) indicates a single-agent best deviation for one particular type of strategy. For example, considering nodes 4 and 13, node 4 represents the bilateral negotiation in which both agents use strategy R and node 13 represents the bilateral negotiation in which one agent chooses strategy C while the other one chooses strategy R , and the transition between them indicates that there exists such a single-agent best deviation from node 4 to node 13. From this graph, we can also easily check that there only exists one best reply cycle from node 13 to node 11 to node 12 and back to node 13, and for any initial negotiation settings (strategy pro fi les) in the initial state (node 1), all of them will fi nally converge to one node within this cycle through a series of single-agent best deviations.

However, the analysis within bilateral negotiation setting does not give us much information about the robustness of our strategy within a tournament setting involving more than two agents, which will be described in the next section. 4.4.2. Eight-agent negotiation tournaments In this section, we analyze the robustness of our strategy ABiNeS within the context of the negotiation tournament among eight players. We start with a simple case in which each agent is only allowed to choose one strategy from the top four strategies in Section 4.4.2 , and then we perform the robustness analysis by taking all top eight strategies into consideration in Section 4.4.2 , following the setting of ANAC competition. For both cases, each participating agent negotiates with all the other participates. However, different from the setting in ANAC competition, the agents are free to choose any strategy from the set of strategies available and thus different agents may select the same strategy during the same tournament in our EGT analysis. The setting of ANAC competition can be considered as a speci fi c tournament in which each agent chooses a unique strategy among the eight strategies.

One natural way is to perform robust analysis over all domains, however, this can hide a lot of detailed information due to the averaging effects. Besides, most of the domains are relatively small and thus more easy for the agents to negotiate to get a high utility under the limited negotiation time (3 min). Therefore, we conduct the robustness analysis under the tournament setting over the challenging domain: Travel domain, similar to previous work ( Williams et al., 2012b ). The Travel domain is one of the largest and most complex domains in the competition, which thus can better re fl ect the practical negotiation scenarios which usually involve a large number of possible proposals to consider. In addition, different from Williams et al. (2012b) , we set the discounting factor of this domain to the low value of 0.5 instead of 1 (without discounting). Under the setting with high discounting effect, it requires the agents to delicately and adaptively trade off between concession to the opponent (be fear of obtaining lower payoff due to large discounting effect) and staying tough (hope to get higher payoff by letting the opponent concede fi rst) against different types of opponents. Therefore we believe that this setting can better re fl ect the behavior differences between different strategies.

Negotiation tournament analysis over top four strategies : In this section, we consider the eight-player negotiation tournament over the set S  X f C ; L ; O ; R g of the top four strategies. Similar with the analysis in bilateral negotiation, the total number of strategy pro fi les considered can be reduced from j S j j P j  X  65 536 to j S j 1  X  X  165 considering the symmetry of the negotiation. The robustness analysis is performed using the model checker PAT ( Sun et al., 2009 ). Based on the veri fi cation from PAT ( Hao and Song ), we observe that there only exists one empirical pure strategy strategy ABiNeS , and also for all non-equilibrium tournaments, there always exists a single-agent best deviation path leading to this equilibrium. This result indicates that our strategy is very robust under the setting of negotiation tournament, even though the agents' average payoff under this tournament is lower com-pared with some other tournaments (e.g., all agents adopting the strategy IAMHaggler2012 8 ). Similar phenomena (the inef fi Nash equilibrium from the social perspective) are commonly observed in non-cooperative game theory. For example, in the prisoner's dilemma game, mutual defection is the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium, but there exists another Pareto-optimal outcome of mutual cooperation under which all agents' payoffs can be signi fi cantly increased.

We give a speci fi c illustration of how the agents adjust their strategy choices between different tournaments under the EGT analysis in Fig. 4 . This deviation analysis graph is generated automatically using the model checker PAT's simulation tool, which can be interpreted in the same way as Fig. 3 . From Fig. 4 , we can clearly observe the overall trend that all agents choosing strategies different from C have the incentive to deviate from their current strategies to strategy C . This deviation analysis graph can be viewed as a graph with six levels, and the transitions between every adjacent levels i and j correspond to single-agent best deviations from states in level i to states in level j . At the last level, all agents originally choosing strategies different from C have switched to strategy C , thus converging to the terminating node 13 which corresponds to the pure strategy Nash equilibrium  X  C ; nodes (e.g., node 3) have multiple outgoing transitions, indicating that there exist multiple agents who have the incentives to deviate from their current negotiation strategies. However, previous robustness analysis based on the best single-agent deviation principle fails to model this kind of concurrent deviations.
Negotiation tournament analysis over top-eight strategies : In this section, we turn to the analysis of the complete eight-player tournament over the top eight strategies following the setting of
ANAC 2012. In this setting, the total number of strategy pro considered can be reduced from j S j j P j  X  16 777 216 to  X  j 6435 due to symmetry of the negotiation. According to the veri fi cation results from PAT ( Hao and Song ), a similar result as that in the previous case in Section 4.4.2 can be observed. There exists only one empirical pure strategy Nash equilibrium ,  X  C ;
C ;
C ; C ; C ; C  X  , where all agents adopt our strategy ABiNeS , and also the basin of attraction of this equilibrium is 100%. This indicates that our strategy ABiNeS is also robust under the full negotiation tournament setting over top eight strategies. Similar deviation trends as the case in Section 4.4.2 can also be found here: for any initial tournament, those agents choosing strategies other than strategy C have the incentive to switch to strategy C to maximally increase their individual average payoffs, and thus after a series of single-agent best deviations, fi nally the strategy pro fi verge to the pure strategy Nash equilibrium  X  C ; C ; C ; 5. Related work negotiation strategies for automated negotiating agents in the literature. The most typical approach in the literature is concession-based strategy such as ABMP strategy ( Jonker et al., 2006 ). The ABMP strategy agent decides on the next move based on its own utility space only and makes concession to its negotiating partners according to certain concession pattern.
However, since the dynamics and in fl uences of the negotiating partners are not taken into consideration, the weakness of this type of strategies is that it is dif fi cult to reach those mutually bene fi cial outcomes and thus is inef fi cient in complex negotiation scenarios.
 have been proposed to model certain aspects of the negotiation scenario to improve the ef fi ciency of the negotiation outcome such as the opponent's preference pro fi le and the knowledge of the negotiation domain ( Faratin et al., 2003; Saha et al., 2005; Hindriks and Tykhonov, 2008; Baarslag et al., 2011; Jakub and Ryszard, 2006; Chen and Weiss, 2012; Williams et al., 2012a;
Hindriks et al., 2006; Fatima et al., 2007; Robu et al., 2005; Fujita et al., 2012 ). Since our work is within the negotiation setting of
ANAC competition which focuses on the independent multi-issue negotiation, we only introduce representative works under the settings of the independent multi-issue negotiation in detail.
However, it is worth noting that designing effective negotiation strategy and protocol under interdependent multi-issue negotiation setting is also a very active research in the automated negotiation area. Until now, a large number of work has been done in this direction to address the challenges of accurate prediction of the opponent's nonlinear utility function (e.g., the scalability issue with the increasing of the number of negotiating items) ( Hindriks et al., 2006; Fatima et al., 2007; Robu et al., 2005; Fujita et al., 2012 ).
Saha et al. (2005) propose a learning mechanism using Che-bychev's polynomials to approximately model the negotiating opponent's decision function in the context of repeated two-player negotiations. They prove that their algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the actual probability function of the negotiating partner under in fi nite sampling. Experiments also show that the agent using their learning mechanism can outperform other simple learning mechanisms and also be robust to noisy data.
However, in their approach, it is assumed that the agents negotiate over one indivisible item (price) only, thus it is not applicable to more general multi-issue negotiation scenarios.

Hindriks and Tykhonov (2008) propose a Bayesian learning based technique to model the negotiating opponent's private preference in the context of bilateral multi-issue negotiations.
To make the learning of the opponent's preference feasible, they made two major assumptions: assumption on the structure of the opponent's utility function and the rational assumption of the opponent's tactic. Speci fi cally, they assume that the utility function modeling the opponent's preference is linearly additive and also the evaluation function for each issue can be modeled by means of three types of functions (downhill shape, uphill shape and triangular shape). Besides, they assume that the opponent makes its offer based on a speci fi c linearly concessive function. They evaluate this technique on several negotiation domains and show that it can improve the ef fi ciency of the bidding process by incorporating this preference prediction technique into a negotia-tion strategy. One notable application of this modeling technique is that it is integrated into a negotiation strategy called TheNego-tiator ( Baarslag et al., 2013 ) which participated in ANAC 2011 ( Baarslag et al., 2013 ).

Jakub and Ryszard (2006) propose a negotiation strategy based on the predictions of the negotiating partner's future behaviors using difference method. Based on the predictive move of the negotiation opponent, the negotiation can be modeled as multi-stage control process and the task of determining the optimal next-step offer is equivalent to the problem of determining the sequence of optimal control. Simulation results show that the agents using their mechanism can greatly outperform the classical approaches in terms of utilities. However, their mechanism is only applicable in the single-item negotiation scenario. Besides, they put strong assumption on the opponent's behaviors in that the negotiation opponent's strategy is the combination of time-dependent and behavior-dependent tactics, and thus may not work well against other opponents with more complex adaptive strategies.
 Chen and Weiss (2012) introduce a novel negotiation strategy
OMAC (opponent modeling and adaptive concession), which consists of two major aspects: ef fi cient opponent modeling and adaptive concession making. Different from previous work which directly models the opponent's strategy or its preferences, they propose predicting the OMAC agent's utilities of its opponent's future counter-offers using wavelet decomposition and cubic smoothing spline techniques. Based on the above prediction of the future utilities that the opponent is willing to offer, the OMAC agent adaptively adjusts its concession rate. They evaluate this strategy against the top fi ve negotiation strategies participating in the ANAC 2011 ( Baarslag et al., 2013 ) across a variety of domains under the Genius platform ( Lin et al., 2012 ), and simulation results show that the OMAC agent can outperform the top fi ve agents from ANAC'11. Another notable application of this strategy is that it is implemented as the OMACAgent that has participated in the ANAC 2012 and ranked the third place ( The Third International Automated Negotiating Agent Competition, 2012 ). 6. Conclusion and future work In this paper, we propose an adaptive negotiation strategy ABiNeS for automated agents to negotiate in bilateral multi-issue negotiation scenarios. We introduce the concept of non-exploitation point  X  to adaptively adjust the ABiNeS agent's concession degree to its negotiating opponent, and propose a reinforcement-learning based approach to determine the optimal proposal for the negotiating partner to maximize the possibility that the offer will be accepted by the opponent.

The performance of the ABiNeS strategy is evaluated using two different measures: ef fi ciency (average payoff) within a single negotiation tournament and robustness which is determined by the size of the basin of attraction of those strategy pro strategy belongs to under different negotiation tournament set-tings. Our strategy ABiNeS is shown to be very ef fi cient against the state-of-the-art strategies from ANAC 2012 and can obtain the highest average payoff over a large number of negotiation domains. Detailed analysis of the ABiNeS strategy in terms of the in fl uences of its two major decision components on the negotia-tion ef fi ciency is also provided, which gives us valuable insights of why it can win the championship in ANAC 2012. Last but not the least, we propose applying model checking techniques to perform EGT analysis to determine the robustness of the strategies, and the ABiNeS strategy is found to be very robust in both bilateral negotiations and negotiation tournaments among eight players following the setting of ANAC competition.

We believe that the performance of the ABiNeS strategy can be further improved in a number of ways. As future work, one worthwhile direction is to further re fi ne the estimation of the negotiating partner's concessive degree to further exploit the negotiating partner, by taking into consideration the magnitude of the utility that the negotiating partner proposes. Besides, it is worthwhile to further investigate the negotiation performance in ANAC 2012 and integrate the current existing negotiating techni-ques (i.e., preference modeling and strategy prediction) into the ABiNeS strategy under different combinations in different negotia-tion scenarios.
