 1. Introduction
Heat energy is an important factor in electrical equipment for increasing operational reliability. Electrical current passes through a resistive component and generates heat. The thermal energy generated from an electrical component is directly proportional to the square of the current passing through it and its resistance ( I loss). Therefore, an increase in resistance results in an increase in heat. Over time, the condition of the electrical components will begin to deteriorate because of various reasons, such as poor or dirty connections, overloading, insulation problems, load imbal-ances, corrosion, and wiring mistakes ( Korendo and Florkowski, 2001 ). Components show increased resistance and heat generation with increasing deterioration. The increase in heat energy can cause electrical equipment to fail and fi res to break out. The faults caused by the abnormal heating effect can be prevented if heat is detected at an early stage by effective screening and if necessary steps are immediately taken.

Infrared thermography (IRT) senses the heat produced in elec-trical components. The thermal pro fi les of different electrical com-ponents and connectors are captured by using an infrared camera. The thermal pro fi le (i.e., thermogram) consists of a heat picture and a scale of the temperature values of the equipment. The different colors of the temperature scale represent the different temperature zones in the equipment. By using this pro fi le, thermographers analyze the thermal images and classify the condition of hotspots on the basis of the priority level of repairs. The thermographers then provide suggestions for further action. Finally, the components with hotspots are tested and repaired according to the priority level ( Huda and Taib, 2013 ).

Both manual and Automatic Feature Extraction (AFE) methods are currently employed for the intelligent classi fi cation of the thermal conditions of electrical equipment on the basis of thermography.
Almeida et al. (2009) proposed an intelligent fault diagnosis system based on thermography for lighting arrestors by using 2 types of variablesasinputsofaneuro-fuzzynetwork.Thermographicand show approximately 90% accuracy. In one study, RGB color scale data and temperature data were used as the input features of Arti
Neural Network (ANN) to detect internal faults ( Sha fi  X  2010 ). The experiment obtained a 99.38% testing accuracy. Smedberg (2006) and Wretman (2006) proposed an intelligent classi fi system based on ANN to diagnose 3-phase fuses and different forms of connection problems. The 4 input parameters of ANN were used, namely, absolute max temperature, relative max temperature, mean temperature difference compared with the other regions of the image, and histogram distance to the other regions of the image. The test error rate was 9.5% when all 4 feature parameters are used as
ANN inputs, and the error rate was 31.2%when only histogram distance is used as input. The dataset comprised 74 infrared images.
One of the disadvantages of working with a small dataset is that the reliability of the results can s ometimes be questionable.
On the contrary, several studies have been conducted on the basis of the AFE method and intelligent classi fi cation system.
Nazmul Huda et al. (2012) proposed a semi-automatic system for electrical thermography. This system uses 15 statistical features and
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network to classify thermal conditions as normal, warning, and critical. This system achieved 78.5% accuracy. Another research proposed an intelligent system to detect faults of electrical equipment in ground substations based on
Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classi fi er and 22 image features of Zernike moments. The diagnosis obtained 68.42% accuracy ( Rahmani et al., 2010 ). In one study, 10 statistical features and MLP network were employed to differentiate between normal and defective conditions. The system achieved 82.40%accuracy ( Nazmul
Huda and Taib, 2013 ). In another study, 6 statistical features and MLP network were used to identify the overheated component; the system reached 79.4% accuracy ( Huda et al., 2014 ).
 To develop a robust and reliable system, a new Recursively
Constructed Fuzzy System (RCFS) is introduced in this study to classify the conditions of hotspots in components. The proposed system employs AFE and a novel intelligent classi fi cation system.
The gray scale images of infrared thermal images of components are segmented by using a manual thresholding technique. Then,
AFE system automatically extracts six intensity features (i.e., maximum, minimum, mean, median, standard deviation, and variance). The RCFS is a self-automated system that automatically detects the conditions of components and classi fi es the abnorm-alities of electrical equipment into classes, namely, normal, warn-ing, and critical. In this study, the RCFS is an output-context fuzzy system that recursively constructs the fuzzy rule base by deter-mining the prominent distinction on the output domain. The termination criterion for recursive algorithm is not threshold as presented in Wang et al. (2010) , which realizes from previous and present stages of evolving. The algorithm terminates by recogniz-ing the over fi tted partition of the system; therefore, an effective rule base is obtained by the proposed RCFS. After termination, a further evolving process will decrease the model performance.
Hence, the computational model of the fuzzy system is automa-tically designed by the RCFS rather than by human experts.
Neural fuzzy systems are hybrid systems that capitalize on the functionalities of fuzzy systems and neural networks ( Nauck et al., 1997 ). The black-box nature of a neural network can be resolved by integrating the interpretability of a fuzzy system into a connectionist structure ( Nauck et al., 1997; Tung et al., 2011 ).
Furthermore, introducing the learning capabilities of a neural network into a fuzzy system will enable the system to automati-cally re fi ne its parameters ( Bosque et al., 2014; Tung et al., 2011 ). The output-constrained cluster approach ( Wang et al., 2011 ) and
Semantic Cointention (SC) approach ( Mencar et al., 2011 ) consider the fuzzy c-means (FCM) to partition data. In the output-constrained cluster approach ( Wang et al., 2011 ), the output space is fi rst roughly partitioned by using FCM. Thereafter, the data within each output constraint are further re fi ned on the basis of  X  separability,  X  which refers to the connectivity of the inputs. Prior knowledge of rough clustering in the output space makes a fuzzy system unintelligent. The results in Wang et al. (2011) and Mencar et al. (2011) are highly subjective and uncertain because prior knowledge (user-de fi ned number of clusters) was used to design these fuzzy systems. The results are subjective in the sense that the user-de fi ned numbers of clusters are applied to the environ-ment. Nonlinear training or testing errors can be observed in the evaluation, and an absence of over fi tting/under fi tting assessment is present. Therefore, uncertain results (nonlinear training or testing error) are obtained for some clusters. For example, based on Mencar et al. (2011) for the ionosphere dataset, a nonlinear nature of the testing errors is observed while number of cluster increases. For the automobile dataset, Wang et al. (2011) shows that the training error increases and the testing error decreases with increasing number of rules. Nevertheless, inconsistent results between automobile and census datasets were found. The output domain is evenly partitioned similar to the method of Pedrycz and
Kwak (2006) ; therefore, the output domain ignores the local distribution of the input data. An evenly partitioned output domain may also cause under fi tting or over fi tting, therefore leading to inaccurate performance. The aforementioned limita-tions of the existing models are considered in the RCFS. The RCFS is a self-organizing process and evolves by considering both the input and output spaces. The evolving process continues until the termination criteria are ful fi lled and the RCFS successfully obtains an effective rule base.
 describes the necessity of IRT for fault diagnosis. Section 3 discusses the methodology of thermographic diagnosis. Section 4 covers the AFE technique. Section 5 elaborates on the RCFS and its algorithms.
Section 6 evaluates the expert system for thermographic diagnosis of electrical components. Section 7 concludes. 2. Importance of infrared thermography-based condition monitoring perature of an object by detecting the infrared energy radiated from the surface of this object. The IRT t echnique is an early internal and external fault diagnosis system for electrical components and pro-vides various advantages over conventional thermal condition and fault diagnosis tools ( Kregg, 2004 ). Some of the advantages of the IRT diagnostic system are described as follows. 2.1. Preventive/predictive maintenance (run-to-failure or preventive maintenance) are used. The run-to-failure approach is simple and straight forward. This approach does not involve an out fl ow of money for maintenance before the eventual failure of the equipment. The approach waits for equip-ment failure before any action is taken for maintenance. Therefore, this method is more expensive than preventive maintenance. By contrast, a thermography-based diagnosis system allows preven-tive/predictive maintenance for the early prevention of equipment failure without interrupting running operations, thus saving money. According to historical data in the United States ( TBPPM, 2011 ), the effective use of preventive/predictive maintenance will decrease about 33  X  50% of the maintenance cost wasted by most manufacturing and production plants. (I) Preventive maintenance: Preventive maintenance refers to electrical equipment maintenance according to the statistical or historical information on operating capacity, failure history, and Mean-Time-To-Failure (MTTF) instead of tracking equip-ment performance. A preventive maintenance program sche-dules the repairing and rebuilding activities for electrical equipment. Suppose an electric component operates for 10 months before needing any repairs. By using the preventive technique, the equipment will be removed from service and rebuilt after 10 months of operation. However, if the equip-ment does not need to be rebuilt after 10 months, labor and material will be wasted. If the equipment fails before 10 months, the problems should be fi xed after failure; this approach is usually more expensive than scheduled mainte-nance. Note that this case is just a random example and is not supported by any type of empirical data. (II) Predictive maintenance: Predictive maintenance refers to the maintenance of electrical equipment on the basis of the direct monitoring of actual operating conditions and the regular collection of data on measurements, ef fi ciency, heat distribu-tion, and other indicators instead of depending on statistical or historical data. A predictive maintenance program schedules all maintenance activities according to factual data and repairs the equipment if necessary before the occurrence of failure ( Epperly et al., 1997 ). 2.2. Fire prevention According to the reports of the Fire and Rescue Department of
Malaysia on the causes of fi res in buildings ( STAT, 2012 ), approxi-mately 2317 fi re-related incidents have occurred between January 2012 and June 2012, thus making the average number of incidents approximately 387 a month. The report says that a total of 1049 incidents were caused by electrical problems. This fi gure was almost 46% of the total causes of fi res in buildings and mainly involved electrical wiring problems (809 cases) and electrical equipment failure (240 cases). Failure of electrical distribution equipment can produce an ignition and fi re. One of the causes of ignition is excessive ohmic heating in electrical distribution. The causes of excessive ohmic heating can be classi fi ed into gross overloads, excessive thermal insulation, stray currents, ground faults, overvoltage, and poor connections ( Coutin et al., 2012 ).
These conditions tend to occur in old buildings with outdated and deteriorating electrical wirings or electrical wirings that are inappropriately amended or insuf fi cient for the electrical load.
However, newly constructed buildings are not immune to these conditions ( Plumecocq et al., 2011; Babrauskas, 2001 ). 2.3. Reduction of energy loss
The frequent monitoring of the thermal condition of electrical equipment is necessary to reduce the heat loss that occurs due to elevated surface temperatures. The thermal insulation survey of a 460 MW thermal power station in India reveals that approximately 0.426768 million kJ/h of heat loss occurs because of bare surfaces, inadequate/damaged insulation, or open cladding condition in all four units. This fi gure is equivalent to a coal loss of about 1847 Mt per annum. Further analysis shows that if the thermal condition these faulty insulated areas are monitored, a fi nancial saving of around 59,052 USD per annum will be achieved, thus amounting to a simple payback period of about one month ( Garnaik, 2011 ). 2.4. Reduced maintenance cost
The most ef fi cient and cost-effective ways to increase system reliability include identifying faults quickly before a critical condition arises, scheduling follow-up inspec tions, and repairing and diagnosing faults within an appropriate period. Thermographic inspection allows for the easy identi fi cation of potential problems, quanti potential energy savings, intervention scheduling, and priority setting for preventive and predictive maintenance or for immediate service to minimize the risk of failure and maintenance cost. 2.5. Avoiding unnecessary repairs
Thermographic inspection can display the actual defect area in equipment, thus reducing the need to disassemble, rebuild, repair, or replace good components. Hence, maintenance costs are reduced and revenue is increased. 2.6. Increased production and safety
The diagnostic system can diagnose faults without interrupting or shutting down the service, thus resulting in increased produc-tion. Furthermore, the failure of electrical components can be catastrophic and can injure or even kill employees, maintenance personnel, or the public. 2.7. Increased life time
The power rating of the equipment indicates the amount of energy that the equipment can exert without being damaged. Before failure, the equipment is operated at an excessive power level, which resists the electricity fl ow and generates heat. Therefore, the equip-ment overheats and operating ef fi ciency is decreased. However, thermography can increase the lifetime and ef fi ciency of equipment via the early detection of heat.
 3. Methodology of thermographic diagnostics 3.1. Image capture
An infrared camera is used to capture the thermal image of the targeted electrical equipment. In this study, a total of 253 hotspots from 139 infrared images were captured from the Main Switch Boards (MSB). The Fluke Ti25 thermal camera with fusion technology was used to capture the images. Table 1 shows the speci fi cations of Fluke
Ti25. For capturing the image, the thermal imager orientation is positioned directly toward the target equipment to obtain an accurate measurement. The emissivity val ue was set to 0.95, as recommended for the thermography of most types of electrical equipment. Note that the ambient temperature around the equipment is between 30 33 1 C during the inspection.

Selecting an appropriate distance between the target equip-ment and camera in fl uences the reliability of the thermographic inspection of electrical components. If the selected distance is incorrect, small points in the test object will remain undetected.
A thermal image captured from different distances is presented in Fig. 1 . The measured maximum temperatures of the same cable for Fig. 1 (a), (b), and (c) are 57.3, 59.1, and 59.5 1 C from distances of 5, 2, and 1 m, respectively. For varied distances, a small error occurs in the measurement ( Neto et al., 2006; Baranski and Polak, 2010 ). However, accurately detecting the ROI of equipment is a challenge because of the reduced image size with increasing distance. For example, the image at 5 m in Fig. 1 (a) shows a reduced ROI width compared with images at 2 and 1 m. Therefore, identifying the spots that need to be recognized is challenging if the images are randomly taken from long distances.

On the contrary, pixel intensity varies with ROI size and the proposed features depend on the pixel intensities of the target component. Therefore, the thermographic inspection should follow a distance criterion by assuming th attheROIcanbefocusedeasily.In this research, we consider the ROIs taken from a distance of 0.5 3.2. Typical condition monitoring by IRT
The manual monitoring of component conditions is based on the comparative temperature analysis between hot and reference spots ( Huda and Taib, 2013 ). This technology is simply called qualitative  X  T factor analysis. After capturing the thermal images, the hotspot and reference areas are identi fi ed visually by analyzing a color map. The hotspot supports the maximum temperature of faulty components, whereas the reference area is the minimum temperature of the same type, load, or the same repeated com-ponent of the equipment. Thereafter, the difference between the hotspot and reference spot temperatures is determined as the factor, which is used as the decision-making parameter for the condition of the overheated component. The  X  T factor can be interpreted directly from RGB data. Several standards for measur-ing  X  T include those of the International Electrical Testing Association ( STD, 2011 ) and the American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM) ( ASTM, 2012 ). The technique is widely used for electrical thermography because of its simplicity and minor emissivity in fl uence. However, the main drawback of this techni-que is that it does not work in a three-phase system because all phases over heat simultaneously; this situation is infrequent in electrical systems. Fig. 2 shows the fl owchart of the IRT inspection of a three-phase electrical system.
 ( 1 C) Z 15), 63 spots are in the warning condition (5 o  X  and 153 spots are normal (  X  T ( 1 C) r 5). All these component condi-tions (i.e.,  X  T ( 1 C)) are evaluated manually by using infrared image analysis software. Some examples of the conditions are illustrated in
Fig. 3 . Regions with high brightness (denoted by the red color) show more defects than regions with low brightness. For instance,
Fig. 3 (c) shows that the maximum temperature values of B and C are 72.7 and 90.9 1 C, respectively, whereas 64.6 1 C is the maximum temperature value of A or the reference area. The temperature difference between these two phases reveals that B and C are in normal and critical conditions, respectively. 4. Hotspot detection and feature extraction 4.1. Hotspot detection
Daime software version 1.3.1, which is a digital image analysis tool, is used to detect equipment defects and extract quantitative features from defect images ( Daims et al., 2006 ). Segmentation was performed to fi nd the hotspots of electrical components. Daime can segment hot regions on the basis of the threshold value. In the present study, the custom thresholding technique (i.e., manual thresholding) value is set to generate an image of a defect. The image of the defect was produced by setting the threshold value
T manually. The original grayscale image shows the hotspot clearly in the value of T ; thus, this value was selected as the threshold value for identifying the defect of an image. Thereafter, the image was segmented on the basis of the threshold image.

In this study, two cases were considered to select the desired hotspots: objects with the highest pixel intensity and objects with an area equal to or greater than the half of the maximum area object. The maximum temperature region of an image carries the maximum intensity value. Therefore, the maximum area of the component is generally the region with the highest pixel intensity.
In some cases, more than one hotspot is detected in the selected image. Some fake hotspots will be generated because of the electrical installation material and the special structure that causes a high re fl ection rate or re fl ection from the sun, thus jeopardizing the infrared emission measurement ( Chou and Yao, 2009 ). By using the object editor, hot defects are manually selected, whereas spurious defects and background are removed. Fig. 4 shows the different steps of defect detection in electrical equipment. 4.2. Automatic feature extraction
A total of six intensity features were computed by using the pixel intensity values of the connected image components. The features are maximum intensity, minimum intensity, average intensity, median intensity, standard deviation, and variance of intensity values. The extracted features are de fi ned as follows: Maximum intensity  X  max  X  l 1 Minimum intensity  X  min  X  l 1 Mean intensity ;  X   X  1  X  q  X  l 1 Variance ;  X  2  X  1  X  q  X  l 1 Standard deviation  X  where q is the number of distinct gray levels in the object image, p ( q ) is the histogram of the object's pixel intensity, and l is the object's possible intensity level. Mean intensity is the average pixel value, which determines the brightness or darkness of the de object image. Maximum and minimum intensities de fi ne the max-imum and minimum pixel intensity values of the object image, respectively. Variance determines the dispersion of gray-level pixels from the mean and standard deviation of pixel intensities, which is similar to variance but is different in value. If the intensity values are arranged in ascending order, the middle value is de fi ned as the median intensity value.
 5. Condition monitoring of hotspots: recursively constructed output-context fuzzy approach 5.1. Preliminaries: distinct points and effective rulebase
The main feature of the RCFS is its ability to identify prominent distinct points in the output domain and construct an effective rule base. Fig. 5 illustrates the prominent distinct points in the output domain. A prominent distinction point describes the highly distinct data which depict points with reasonable approximation errors. Therefore, selecting these distinct points to partition the output domain reduces the model error. Wang et al. (2010) , Kosko (1995) , and Ding et al. (2000) previously described the selection of splitting points to reduce approximation errors. However, unlike the ECSFS ( Wang et al., 2010 ) where the LSM algorithm is used to select the splitting points, the RCFS is evolved and self-determines the distinct output-context to obtain an effective rulebase.
Consider a modeling problem with n input variables and N data samples. Assume an input vector of i th training data  X  x ; input vector x i and the corresponding output d i and x  X  X  x ; THEN Mamdani-type fuzzy rule at the t th evolving stage: input variable. A Gaussian membership function is described for C and its corresponding A t ; s  X  X  p .  X  and  X   X  where c and  X  are the center and width of the membership function, respectively; a k  X  or b k  X  denotes that the data are located at the border of the k th output context;  X  4 0is a minimum membership value ( Tung and Quek, 2010 ) that is also a distinguishability factor that maintains the semantic value for the output contexts. context fuzzy system is shown in Fig. 6 . The RCFS employs the
Mamdani-type fuzzy system and starts with an initial domain of the whole output space followed by the further partitions of the output domain to identify the prominent distinction point(s). Adaptation is performed for both distinct output context and its corresponding input clusters. In the RCFS, each output-context associated with the input clusters is considered the output-context structure. Previous knowledge in the system and new knowledge from the training data are incorporated in the system to provide an accurate representation of the fuzzy model. Recursive partitioning and evolving processes are continued until a termination criterion is achieved to obtain an effective rulebase.

Therefore, Eq. (10) can be represented as follows:
A
Consequently, the output model of Eq. (9) can be re-written as follows: o  X  A
The accuracy of the model output depends on the tuning process of the output domain, C t ;  X  s  X  , which is depicted in Eq. (12) .
Hence, if proper tuning points (distinct points) are found in the output domain, a balanced partition of the output domain is realized with an effective rulebase that has reasonable accuracy.
The maximum compatibility grade with the new pattern is used to determine the winner rule. The winner rule ( Ishibuchi and
Nakashima, 2001 ) is expressed for Eq. (6) in Eq. (13) . y  X  C
A 5.2. Base step: knowledge of the whole output domain
The RCFS begins with the fi rst fuzzy rule by translating the knowledge of the global domain, the formation of the fi rst conse-quent part (when t  X  1, s  X  1) of the output-context, C t  X  1 ;  X  s  X  1  X  which can be described as follows: c where d 1 is the output of the 1st training data and  X  global of the output domain for the initial fuzzy rule. Both d 1 the Gaussian function are embedded in C 1 ;  X  1  X  .The fi part associated with the p th input variable can be written as Eq. (15) :

Remark 1. RCFS is a self-organizing method. The similarity measure ( SM ) of two consecutive Gaussian-shaped fuzzy levels has been described by Jin et al. (1999) . A similarity threshold ( best-matched output context with the presented value. A prominent distinction is observed and the RCFS forms a new distinct output context if the similarity measure between the output context and presented between the output context and presented value does not exceed the threshold value ( SM r  X  ), the RCFS fi nds the best-matched output best-matched output context structure provides a satisfactory descrip-tion of the presented value. The merging process is then applied to the presented value and the best-matched output context.
 The step-by-step process for the base step is referred to as
Algorithm 1 . The base step aims to realize a single fuzzy rule by translating the whole output domain in a self-organizing manner. A prominent distinction is undesirable for the base step ( Algorithm 1 ); hence, SM  X   X  is required to continue the self-organizing process depicted in Step 5.

RCFS begins with an initial rule, and  X  global is the width of the output domain in the fi rst rule that covers the whole output domain. Thereafter, the evolving process starts by decreasing the constant rate  X  evolve , thus increasing the fuzzy rules and terms. The constant width  X  evolve is taken arbitrarily such that the creation of the output partitions slowly increases. Consequently, this evolving process adds more fuzzy rules and terms to fi nd the optimum accuracy at a rational partition of the output context.

At the evolving stage t  X  2, the fi rst output context ( C morethanonerulegeneration( s 4 1) is considered, is formed as follows: c  X  evolve is taken arbitrarily such that the creation of the output partitions slowly increases. By assuming that an existing output context exists, the RCFS computes the similarities between the presented value and existing output-c ontext structures. The similarity match (see Remark 1 )betweentheoutput d i of the i th training data  X  x ; d i and an existing output context ( C t ;  X  s  X  ) is given as follows:
If SM 4  X  , a prominent distinction is observed and RCFS forms a new distinct output context at the evolving stage t . c
The similarity measure for a self-organizing system is described in Remark 1 . The merging process is conducted for the sigma (width) of the consequent part C t ;  X  s  X  (i.e., output context) according to the approach of TungandQuek(2010) . Assuming that  X  a 1 ; b 1 training data  X  x ; d i ,respectively.Points  X  a 1 ; b 1 ; denote the left support, right suppo rt, and center. Therefore, the average width  X  t ; s  X  X  avg between the best-matched output-context struc-ture and the present data d i can be written as Eq. (19) :
The recursive construction of the output-context fuzzy system is depicted in Algorithm 2 . The balanced number of rules ( BNR ) index is introduced to terminate the recursion, and will be discussed in Remark 2 .

Remark 2. In Algorithm 2 ,arecursionindex,namelythe BNR index, is used for the termination criteria. As the evolving stage proceeds, the width of the output context (or  X  t init ) becomes small. At a speci evolving stage, the width of the output context becomes so small and unbalanced that it cannot represent the data properly, thereby leading to a fuzzy system with a large number of rules and causing over fi tting (i.e., data are fi tted closely because of the small width of the output structure).

The BNR index is used to handle the situation from unbalanced partitions or over fi tting clari fi ed in Remark 2 . BNR ward index for recognizing unbalanced situations in the recursive process at the t evolving stage and for preventing the algorithm from further evolving.

BNR t  X   X  NR t NR t 1  X  where NR t and NR t 1 are the number of rules at the t and  X  t 1  X  evolving stages, respectively. The characteristics of the BNR index are as follows: (1) According to Eq. (20) , BNR A 0 ; 1  X  shows the balanced partition (2) If BNR t holds the fi rst criteria from Eq. (21) , the evolving (3) BNR t  X  0 indicates that the number of distinct output context (4) At a speci fi c evolving stage, the BNR index becomes greater (5) Let, BNR t 4 1 terminate the recursion procedure at t th evolving
This global learning by the BNR index fi nds the effective rule-base fuzzy system with the lowest approximation error and obtains reasonable accuracy for testing data. The standard root mean square error (RMSE) of the e th evolving process is given as follows:
E e  X  where N is the number of training data. o x i  X  X  and des i model and desired outputs of the i th training data, respectively. is ful fi lled for the RCFS algorithm. Therefore, an effective rulebase is found at the evolving stage e by using Eq. (6) , where minimum error is achieved. e  X f 1 ; 2 ; ... ; e ; ... ; j g and E e  X  min  X  E 1 ; E 2 et al. (2010) to terminate the over fi tting/under fi tting state. Over causes a large number of rules and parameters, whereas under leads to a fuzzy system with a small number of rules and parameters ( Wang et al., 2010 ). The proposed RCFS starts from a single output context (or single rule) and considers this state as an under with high error regions. Thereafter, the RCFS evolves by adding more rules (or output contexts) and the BNR index recognizes the over state. The EER index ( Wang et al., 2010 ) depends on the model error of the current and previous states. Furthermore, the EER index uses a 3% threshold value as a termination criterion to avoid under/over
By contrast, the proposed BNR index depends on the number of rules by using Eq. (20) toterminatetherecursiveprocedure.
 error is found by using Eq. (23) . Eq. (21) describes the features of the BNR index, which is fully online and does not have a prede fi ned threshold. RCFS handles the evolving process by using the self-organizing approach and terminates the over fi tting con-dition by using the BNR index. 5.4. Characteristics of the RCFS (1) RCFS automatically observes the prominent distinction point (2) The evolving process is terminated depending on the BNR index, (3) RCFS uses a number of rules (number of distinct points or output contexts) for termination. Nevertheless, the realization of the effective rule base uses both the feature (input) and output spaces because it considers the minimum error by using Eqs. (22) and (23) . Hence, the more accurate representa-tion of data can be achieved in the effective rule base. 6. Thermographic diagnostic of electrical components 6.1. Diagnostic preliminaries The expert system for thermographic diagnosis incorporates
AFE and condition of hotspots in order to construct an intelligent fuzzy classi fi cation system. AFE for the thermographic diagnosis of electrical components has been discussed in Section 4 and its actual output data  X  T is depicted in Fig. 7 . Section 4 shows the seven attributes in this datasets, including six input feature and its corresponding output  X  T . The classi fi cation of the condition and fuzzy rule creation will be discussed in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 , respectively. In this paper, a 10-fold cross validation is used to train and test the data. Training datasets are used to realize the effective rule base described in Algorithm 2 ( Section 5.3 ). There-after, the testing datasets are applied to evaluate the proposed RCFS. The examples shown in Tables 2  X  5 and Figs. 9 and 10 use a training dataset from the 10-fold cross validation to clarify the proposed RCFS.

The similarity threshold (  X  ) represents the similarity between two consecutive fuzzy levels;  X  4 0 is the minimum membership value different values of  X  and  X  is based on the study by Tung et al. (2011) .In the current paper,  X   X  0.8 is taken for similarity comparison. Further-more,  X   X  0.5 is considered to strongly cover the UoD and keep the average semantic meaning in the RCFS model. The evolving constant  X  evolve is taken arbitrarily to ensure that the rule number slowly increases. 6.2. Classi fi cation of conditions of electrical hotspots
RCFS starts with the fi rst fuzzy rule by translating the knowl-edge of the global domain;  X  global  X  7 : 5 is found from Algorithm 1 ( Section 5.2 ) as the base value for the initial fuzzy rule. The RCFS evolves the output contexts (or rules) by using Algorithm 2 the formation of the fuzzy rules ( Table 2 ). The termination point BNR 4 1 is found at the evolving stage, where  X  t init  X  2 BNR 4 1 causes over fi tting, that is, data are fi tted closely, thus leading to poor data representation ( Remark 2 ). Therefore, an effective rule base is found at the evolving stage with a minimum error. Hence, RCFS fi nds the effective rule base for the thermo-graphic diagnostic of electrical components by using Eq. (23) , where  X  t init  X  6 : 5 and two fuzzy rules ( Table 2 ). Fig. 8 depicts the consequent parts (or output contexts), which are realized by self-organizing, and distinct points show the semantic interpretability. Therefore, the evolving process recursively constructs the fuzzy system ( Table 2 ) and fi nally realizes an effective rule base with two points for the thermographic diagnostic of electrical components show  X  T values, which are used as the decision-making para-meters about the conditions of the overheated component. Table 3 shows the classi fi cation of the conditions of electrical components, namely, defect and normal. Hence, recommended actions and necessary steps can be taken according to the priority level.
However, the condition of overheated component (i.e.,  X  T ) sho-uld be lower than 7.1 1 C to reduce the priority level because it is Membership expected to ensure a highly predictive automated system with low  X 
T value(s). This highly predictive method enhances the acute diagnostic of electrical equipment. Therefore, further recursion of
Algorithm 2 may be required. Further recursion of Algorithm 2 evolves the output contexts and increases the fuzzy rules ( Table 4 ).
The termination point BNR 4 1isfoundattheevolvingstage,where init  X  1. Therefore, another effective rulebase is found at the evolving stage with minimum error. The RCFS fi nds the effective rulebase with four distinct points ( Fig. 9 ) for the thermographic diagnostic of electrical components, where  X  t init  X  2( Table 4 ). The evolving process recursively constructs the fuzzy system ( Table 4 ) and fi nally realizes an effective rulebase with four prominent distinct points  X  T 1 C  X  X  X  0 : 3 ; 7 : 1 ; 16 : 6 ; 23 : posed RCFS, nonlinear training errors when further recursion is considered are found in Table 4 . RCFS realizes the effective rule base by terminating the recursion by BNR 4 1( Table 2 ). Characteristic
Eq. (21) depicts that further recursion will cause an unbalanced partition( Section 5.3 ). Hence, further recursion reduces the overall performance accuracy( Section 6.3 ). The distinct points for thermo-graphic diagnostic of electrical components show the  X  T values used as decision-making parameters about the conditions of overheated component. Three recommended classes are realized by RCFS, namely, critical, warning and normal ( Table 5 ). These classi are conditions for  X  T ; therefore, an intelligent condition monitoring and an automatic defect analyzing system that improves the defect detection technique of electrical equipment abnormalities can be achieved. 6.3. Fuzzy rule creation and performance comparison mended classes) of the training dataset ( Tables 3 and 5 ). These classes are considered the consequent parts of the fuzzy rule. First, two classes of hotspots are considered by using Table 3 . Corre-spondingly, a total of two fuzzy clusters are identi fi ed by the RCFS for the input  X  output dimensions. Fig. 10 (a)  X  (c) illustrates the identi fi ed fuzzy clusters in the fi rst ( x 1 ), second ( x ( x 3 ) input variables while considering two classes of hotspots.
Given that the fuzzy clusters are ordered, the semantic meaning demonstrates the self-organizing abilities of the proposed RCFS. A total of two Mamdani-type fuzzy rules are realized by the RCFS while considering two classes, namely, defect and normal. These rules are listed in Table 6 , where L  X  low, M  X  medium, H  X  high, and VH  X  very high. Therefore, the electrical component is classi-fi ed as normal if all features ( x 1 x 5 ) are considered L, except for the sixth feature (variance of intensity values).

Table 5 . Four fuzzy clusters are identi fi ed for the input dimensions while considering three classes. However, Table 5 cannot represent the data properly because of further recursion. Therefore, over-lapping input clusters are initiated mostly for H and VH. Four
Mamdani-type fuzzy rules are realized by RCFS while considering three classes, namely, critical, warning, and normal ( Table 6 ). Hence, the electrical component is classi fi ed as normal if all features ( x 2 x 6 ) are considered L, except for the fi rst feature (maximum intensity).

The proposed RCFS is compared with well-known classi fi ers, such as ANFIS, SVM, MLP, and k NN, in terms of accuracy ( Table 7 ). These existing classi fi ers are embedded in MATLAB 7.10.0 (R2010a). In this paper, svmtrain() , train() ,and knnclassify() are used for SVM,
MLP, and k NN, respectively. However, svmtrain() does not support more than two classes. The ANFIS Editor GUI is used for the ANFIS classi fi er, where hybrid optimization, subtractive clustering method, and 100 epochs are used to train the data. However, the comparison in Table 7 shows the reasonable accuracy achieved by the RCFS. The
RCFS achieves better accuracy with respect to existing models while considering either two or three recommended classes. The RCFS realizes the prominent distinct points, which are considered the center of the output contexts (or rule consequents) ( Fig. 5 and
Section 5.1 ). Furthermore, the over fi tting condition introduced by the proposed RCFS terminates the recursive algorithm and realizes an effective rulebase ( Section 5.3 ). Hence, high classi racy for test data with respect to existing models depicts that the accurate representation of data can be achieved in the effective rulebase.

Classi fi cation accuracy is reduced while considering the three recommended classes ( Table 7 ). This phenomenon can be explained by the following conditions. Further recursion after the fi tion ( the BNR index. First, an effective rulebase is found when the over-fi tting state terminates the recursive algorithm ( Table 2 ). The over-fi tting state indicates that a further recursion process causes an unbalanced condition to the model (described in Eq. (21) of the BNR index). Therefore, a second effective rulebase by using Table 4 cannot represent the data properly because further recursion is considered ( Fig. 10 (d)  X  (f)). Classi fi cation accuracy is reduced while considering further recursion ( Table 7 ). However, existing models also achieve less accuracy while conside ring three recommended classes ( Table 7 ), thereby con fi rming the effectiveness of RCFS. 7. Conclusion
In this study, the early detection of hotspots and thermal condition monitoring based on the thermographic fault diagnosis of components is proposed to maintain the reliable and uninter-rupted operation of the power system, thus allowing predictive and preventive diagnosis before major failure occurs. Six intensity features (i.e., maximum, minimum, mean, median, standard devia-tion, and variance) are extracted from each hotspot. The extracted features are then fed to the Recursively Constructed Fuzzy System. The proposed RCFS automatically realizes the conditions of compo-nents that formulate the abnormalities of electrical components into classes, namely, normal, warning, and critical. The RCFS is an output-context fuzzy system that recursively constructs the fuzzy system by realizing the prominent distinction in the output domain. The termination of the recursive algorithm is fully online, does not depend on the threshold, and fi nds an effective rulebase for datasets. Therefore, the proper representation of datasets can be achieved by theeffectiverulebase.
 The characteristics of the expert system (including AFE and RCFS) are described in this paper and evaluated with the datasets of the thermographic diagnostic of electrical components. The evaluation intelligently realizes that  X  T (i.e., conditions of compo-nents) is acceptable. Therefore, an automatic defect analyzing system improves the defect detection technique of electrical equipment abnormalities. Furthermore, the proposed expert sys-tem employs a low number of fuzzy rules or distinct  X  T with reasonable accuracy, thereby showing the signi fi cance of the expert system. For future works, more ef fi cient image processing method and classi fi ers will be employed to acquire better perfor-mance for the intelligent system.
