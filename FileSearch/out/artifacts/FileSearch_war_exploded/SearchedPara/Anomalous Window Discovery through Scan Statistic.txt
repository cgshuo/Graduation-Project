 Anomalous windows are the contiguous groupings of data points. In this paper, we propose an approach for discov-ering anomalous windows using S can S tatistics for L inear I ntersecting P aths (SSLIP). A linear path refers to a path represented by a line with a single dimensional spatial coor-dinate marking an observation point. Our approach for dis-covering anomalous windows along linear paths comprises of the following distinct steps: (a) Cross Path Discovery: where we identify a subset of intersecting paths to be con-sidered, (b) Anomalous Window Discovery: where we out-line three order invariant algorithms, namely SSLIP, Brute Force-SSLIP and Central Brute Force-SSLIP, for the traver-sal of the cross paths to identify varying size directional win-dows along the paths. For identifying an anomalous window we compute an unusualness metric, in the form of a like-lihood ratio to indicate the degree of unusualness of this window with respect to the rest of the data. We identify the window with the highest likelihood ratio as our anoma-lous window, and (c) Monte Carlo Simulations: to ascertain whether this window is truly anomalous and not just a ran-dom occurrence we perform hypothesis testing by computing a p-value using Monte Carlo Simulations. We present exten-sive experimental results in real world accident datasets for various highways with known issues(code and data available from [27], [21]). Our results show that our approach indeed is effective in identifying anomalous traffic accident windows along multiple intersecting highways.
 H.2.8 [ Database Management ]: Database Applications X  Data Mining Algorithms, Experimentation Scan Statistic, Anomalous Window Discovery, Intersecting Paths, Traffic Accidents
Anomalous windows are the contiguous groupings of data points. These data points can be spread in a region, grouped along time or spread along a linear path. The focus of this paper is the discovery of anomalous windows along linear paths. A linear path refers to a path represented by a line with a single dimensional spatial coordinate marking an ob-servation point. For instance mile markers along highways are used in police reports of accidents, locations along gas pipelines refer to breaks in the pipes, markers along bridges and tunnels indicate fractures or tears in the structures. Discovery of anomalous windows along such paths is par-ticularly important in several real world applications such as discovering (a) accident hubs along highways, (b) weak spots in gas pipelines, (c) accidents hubs along air traffic routes, (d) significant tears or fractures along tunnels and bridges, (e) Railroad and Grade-Crossing fatalities, to name a few. An anomalous window here indicates a set of contigu-ous points, such as a group of mile markers with very high accident rates, which are indeed unusual with respect to the rest of the data. For instance, in a highway where various accidents and fatalities are recorded for the mile markers an anomalous window would be an accident hub along the road. Discovery of such well quantified anomalous windows may portend the arrival of a breakdown or an awaiting hazard. Identification of which, will lead to possible quick action in such critical areas. Traditional approaches to identify in-dividual unusual objects [2] (e.g., outliers) and partitioning (clusters) [5] are not suitable for such a discovery. This is primarily because they do not identify and quantify a group of contiguous objects, forming an anomalous window, with respect to the rest of the objects. Scan statistic has proven to be a promising technique in quantifying such anomalous windows [19]. It is used to test if a process is purely random, or if any clusters can be detected in the process output, in-dicating a non-random cause. This facilitates identification of unusual clusters in the data when compared to the rest of the population. Several applications of the scan statistic are discussed in [7]. A variation of the simple scan statis-tic is the spatial [15] and spatio-temporal [16] scan statis-tic, which detects unusual space or space-time windows. It uses a circular window for spatial and cylindrical window for spatio-temporal processes. The unusualness is measured in terms of a test statistic such as the likelihood ratio. [15] It uses a variable sized circular window, centered at each spatial location on the study region until it reaches an up-per size limit. Thus, the circular window is flexible both in location and size. The scan statistic provides a measure of whether the observed number of cases is unlikely for a win-dow of that size, using reference values from the entire study area. By searching for windows without specifying the size or location, this technique is able to avoid pre-selection bias. Other approaches address different shapes of windows such as square, rectangle [20], [11] flexible square shaped windows and other circular windows [3,25]. The linear semantic based scan statistic ( LS 3 ) [13] extends the scan statistic approach ( [19]) to discover windows along a linear path where their shape is fixed to a linear segment. However this approach does not address multiple intersecting linear paths and is not order invariant. In addition free form spatial [14] and spatio-temporal [18] windows have been discussed. How-ever none of these approaches address the discovery of di-rectional anomalous windows in multiple intersecting linear paths. We next present a motivating domain example in transportation to illustrate the importance of discovering such anomalous windows along linear paths.

Example 1. Although there are some very important lead-ing causes of accidents such as not wearing seat belts, driv-ing while intoxicated and so on. It is important to note that recurring crashes or high rates of accidents at or around certain intersections or road segments may indicate possibly correctible flaws in the infrastructure such as the positioning of lights, signage, number of lanes, mergings on to the road, etc. According to the Highway Research and Technology re-port [10] in 1999, 41,611 people were killed on US roads and in 2006 ( NHTSA [23]) there were an estimated 5,973,000 police-reported traffic crashes, in which 42,642 people were killed and 2,575,000 people were injured. The cost of traffic crashes in 1999 was $ 181 billion [10]. Economic costs to society will approach $ 2 trillion over the next 10 years. Fi-nally in a crash causation survey done by NHTSA [22] it was found that about 36% of the vehicles were turning or crossing at an intersection just prior to the crash. The process in-volved in analyzing years of data (such as [1], [21]) and iden-tifying dangerous highway segments and intersections leads to lost time and possibly many lost lives. Thus, it would be effective and useful if the data can be automatically analyzed to identify dangerous intersections and highway segments with unusual accident rates and pinpoint the cause of the unusual accident windows. Existing spatial anomalous win-dow detection techniques (such as [4, 12, 14, 15, 28]) are not suitable for such intersecting linear paths. Specifically, Spa-tial scan statistics [15] address the identification of anoma-lous windows using circular windows for spatial [15] events over a region. However, if a circular window is used along a linear path, then parallel or nearby (but non-intersecting) paths may be considered together in a window. This is be-cause, nearby objects are related to one another due to auto-correlation, but at the same time there exists heterogeneity, which may cause even nearby objects to behave differently. Although, linear paths such as highways are governed by the underlying spatial properties of heterogeneity and autocor-relation, often the spatial information may not be available and there may be a strong heterogeneity even in proximal paths. This becomes a critical factor since directionality of linear paths introduces a higher degree of heterogeneity, for instance in north bound and south bound highways. Hence the treatment needs to be different. We next discuss an ex-ample which illustrates these issues. Let us consider two intersecting highways r 1 and r 130 .

Now let us consider the circle based scan statistic [15]. Figure 1: Circular vs. Linear Directional windows The circle based scan which uses a variable sized circular window as shown in figure 1(a-d), is centered at each spa-tial location on the study region until it reaches an upper size limit. Thus, the circular window is flexible both in loca-tion and size. For each such window a statistic is computed (such as the likelihood ratio) to measure the unusualness of the window with respect to the rest of the data. The statistic tests whether the observed number of cases is unlikely for a window of that size, using reference values from the entire study area. Let us say for this example we consider the num-ber of accidents (shown as a X on the path) within a window normalized by the distance of the window as compared to the rest of the study region. The window with the highest value for this statistic is considered as the anomalous window, in this case is shown in figure 1(d) due to the high accident rates. However, it is very much possible that the highway segments which are not necessarily part of the window are also included, such as the non accident prone points in route 130. However, in intersecting linear paths the anomaly may not necessarily reside in a circle. Secondly the anomaly may have a specific directionality in its traversal. The circle based scan traverses from one location to the next in a random or-der without any directionality in the traversal. All the points within the circle are considered to be part of the window by virtue of their proximity defined in the circle. Thus there is an implicit assumption of spatial autocorrelation [17, 29].
Now let us consider a method where the window follows the directionality in its traversal along the path, leading to possible windows such as 1 (e-h) with the window 1(f ) as the most unusual window in terms of a test statistic. Thus if we are analyzing the intersecting routes r 1 ,r 130 ,thenwe need to slide the window not only across r 1 but also part of r 130 in such a way that we cover the bends along the in-tersection of r 1 and r 130 in all possible directions. Such a directional traversal should include within a window, the lo-cations which are clearly related by virtue of not only their explicit proximity but also their combined behavior which is unusual.

Thus following important challenges emerge which are not addressed in the existing approaches [4, 12, 14, 15, 28]:  X 
Directionality : In the setting of intersecting linear paths, directionality becomes a key issue not addressed by prior approaches. Anomalous window discovery first begins with the traversal of the data in such a way that most meaningful windows are captured. Subsequently a test statistic is measured on these windows to see it they are unusual as compared to the rest of the study region. Thus, traversal of a window in linear intersecting paths should be capable of distinguishing the directionality of the paths which, is missing in the current techniques [12 X 15]  X 
Spatial Autocorrelation : Spatial autocorrelation origi-nates from Tobler X  X  First Law of Geography [29], which states that everything is related to everything else but nearby objects are more related than distant objects. Au-tocorrelation [6, 8, 9] literally means the correlation of a variable to itself. Spatial autocorrelation refers to the cor-relation of the variable with itself in space. However, in some cases, even if the spatial objects are closer in prox-imity, they may exhibit different characteristics due to the variation of the values in attributes associated with them.
For instance, an accident pattern on the northern highway may be very different from southern highway. However the current techniques, such as the circle based scan [15], do not distinguish this difference in the window traversal.  X 
Order Invariance : Regardless of the starting point on a set of intersecting paths, any spatial marker on any lin-ear path, the approach should be able to identify the same anomalous window. This is particularly important in con-sistently finding the most critical anomalous window when several paths are intersecting with each other.
 It is important to note that none of the approaches [4, 12 X  15, 18, 28] address all of these aspects in combination. In this paper we propose a technique for discovering anomalous windows using S can S tatistics for L inear I ntersecting P aths (SSLIP), addressing these issues in combination. Specifically our contributions are as follows:  X 
We present multiple algorithms for the discovery of signif-icant anomalous windows along linear intersecting paths,  X 
Our algorithms are order invariant and address the issue of autocorrelation and directionality which are critical for discovery of windows along intersecting linear paths,  X 
We present detailed experimental results in real world highway accident datasets [21] for various algorithms to illustrate the efficacy of our approach. In addition we validate our findings with certain known anomalous win-dows [30] in these real world highway datasets, indicating the efficacy of our approach.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss our approach for discovering anomalous windows using S can S tatistics for L inear I ntersecting P aths (SSLIP) and outline multiple algorithms, in section 3 we discuss de-tailed experimental results for all our algorithms in NJDOT accident data [21]. Finally in section 4 we discuss our con-clusions and lay out future directions.
In this section we present our approach to discover anoma-lous windows using S can S tatistics for L inear I ntersecting P aths (SSLIP). Our approach comprises of the following dis-tinct steps: (a) Cross Path Discovery: for this we be-gin with a set of intersecting paths. However not all paths are intersecting each other. So we define the concept of in-tersections and connected markers. Thus from these paths we identify a subset of cross paths which are under consid-eration. (b) Anomalous Window Discovery: we out-line three order invariant algorithms for window traversal, namely SSLIP, Brute Force-SSLIP and Central Brute Force-SSLIP, for the traversal of the cross paths to identify varying size directional windows along the paths. In each of these algorithms we perform anomalous window discovery where we compute an unusualness metric  X  , in the form of a like-lihood ratio to indicate the degree of unusualness of this window as compared to the rest of the data. We identify the window with the highest likelihood ratio as our anoma-lous window. (c) Monte Carlo Simulations: to ascertain whether this window is truly anomalous and not just a ran-dom occurrence we perform hypothesis testing by computing Table 1: Summary of Terminology used in the paper a statistical significance in the form of p-value using Monte Carlo Simulations. We next outline each step in detail. The terminologies used in the paper are summarized in Table 1.
A linear path comprises of a set of one-dimensional spa-tial locations on the path, called markers placed at various intervals along the path. Each marker is associated with marker spatial coordinates and behavioral attributes. We first formally define a path (adapted from [13]):
Definition 1. [Path] Asetofpaths R = { r 1  X  X  X  r n } ,where apath r i  X  R is comprised of a set of one-dimensional spatial locations called markers m such that each r i = { m r i first m ordinates x r i j and a set of behavioral attributes BA {
For simplicity we consider only a single behavioral at-tribute a r i j . For instance in the case of highway accidents the marker could be a mile marker and the behaviorial attribute is the number of accidents that occurred at this spatial lo-cation.

In addition, all markers in r i = { m r i first  X  X  X  m r i ranged in ascending order of x r i j where  X  m r i p  X  r i  X  X  X  &lt;x r i
Several such paths may intersect. For instance if we con-sider a set of highways, in reality these highways often in-tersect leading to a complex mesh of roads. To facilitate the consideration of intersecting paths we next define an inter-section of paths as a spatial relationship.

Definition 2. [Intersection] Given R = { r 1  X  X  X  r n } where each r i  X  R has a set of associated markers such that r i { ship associated with intersection markers m I ij such that m { Further given R = { r 1  X  X  X  r n } , M I = { m I ij  X  X  X } is the set of all intersection markers that exist in R .
 Nowitispossiblethatseveralpathsmayintersectatone spatial location. So for example if we have three paths r ,r 5 ,r 6 which are intersecting at the same marker, then such a marker can be represented as m I 456 such that their intersection markers are essentially equal in terms of their spatial location, however the behaviorial attribute for this central intersection marker is the sum of each individual intersection marker. As mentioned before our aim is to discover anomalous windows which are a set of contiguous points. In our framework of paths and intersections we now define what these contiguous points are. Essentially these are connected markers along paths. We formally define con-nected markers as follows:
Definition 3. [Connected markers] Given R = { r 1  X  X  X  r n and M I = { m I ij  X  X  X } ,twomarkers m r k p and m r l q where m p  X  r k , m r l q  X  r l are connected in the following three situations: (1) r k = r l such that they are located on the same path. (2)  X  m I lk  X  M I such that r k intersects with r l . (3)  X  m r i s  X  r i where m r i s are connected with both m m
From these set of paths we identify a subset of cross paths which are under consideration.
 Definition 4. [Cross paths] Given R = { r 1  X  X  X  r n } and M
I = { m I ij  X  X  X } ,crosspaths CR = { r 1  X  X  X  r t } where CR is associated with M I CR such that CR  X  R and M I CR  X  M I , where all markers in CR are connected and t&lt;&lt;n . Such cross paths are shown in Figure 2 (a). In general the set of cross paths is much smaller than the set of paths. If we consider a mesh of highways. A cross path is a subset of two or more intersecting paths. Thus we focus on a smaller part of the universe of paths.
A scan window is a set of connected markers. Our aim is to discover the anomalous window that is most unusual as com-pared to all other scan windows. In order to quantify and discover such an anomalous window we first identify quali-fied scan windows that are composed of spatially connected markers along cross paths. W e next propose three meth-ods for identifying scan windows and discovering anomalous ones along cross paths, the main difference between them is in the way they identify scan windows. (a) SSLIP traverses through CR and identifies scan windows of varying size on these traversal paths. However these windows are only direc-tional linear windows. (b) Brute Force-SSLIP (BF-SSLIP) method identifies arbitrary shaped scan windows in a purely combinatorial way. (c) Central Brute Force-SSLIP (CBF-SSLIP) method speeds up the combinatorial process and identifies arbitrary shaped scan windows starting from the intersection markers on cross paths. Once we identify the scan windows using any one of the algorithms we then com-pute the linear scan statistic  X  for each of these windows. Subsequently we discover the anomalous window as the scan window with the highest  X  . Below we first explain the con-cept of an anomalous window and how we quantify it.
In each of the algorithms outlined above, we compute the linear scan statistic  X  for all the scan windows identified and subsequently find the highest  X  in them. Given a scan win-dow win on cross paths CR , the linear scan statistic  X  is computed as follows(adapted from [13]):  X  = ( a win  X  d win where a win is the value of our behavioral attribute of in-terest for the markers within the scan window, d win is the spatial length of the scan window, and a win and d win are their corresponding values outside the scan window which are computed by ( a all  X  a win )and( d all  X  d win ). That a is the total value of our behavioral attribute of interest in CR and d all is the total length of CR . This linear scan statistic  X  indicates the degree of unusualness of the scan window as compared to the rest of the data. The higher the  X  is, the greater the unusualness of the scan window is. The scan window with the highest linear scan statistic  X  is flagged as the anomalous window discovered. However, we also need to validate the highest  X  with a level of significance for which we perform Monte Carlo Simulations as discussed in sub section 2.3. We next present each of the algorithms in detail and then discuss the Monte Carlo testing.
SSLIP algorithm adopts a recursive technique to traverse markers in CR . Starting from a marker on a path in the CR , this traversal proceeds in a particular direction such that the paths in that direction form a sub cross path scr .
From Definition 3 given a set of connected markers { m r k m q } , we say that they are directionally connected if and only if there exists a path to visit each marker exactly once. In addition, given a path r i = { m r i first  X  X  X  m r i last direction means traversing from markers with smaller x r i to markers with larger x r i ,andviceversefor backward direc-tion. We next define sub-cross paths.

Definition 5. [Sub-cross paths] Given CR = { r 1  X  X  X  r t and M I CR = { m I ij  X  X  X } , sub-cross paths scr i are comprised of a set of markers such that scr i = { m r j start  X  X  X  m r  X  X  X  r k  X  CR and all markers in scr i are directionally con-nected.
 the start or end marker of r j such that m r j start = m r m
Such sub-cross paths are shown in Figure 2 (b). The Al-gorithm 1 outlines the discovery of scr and the discovery of anomalous windows using the linear traversal in scr . SSLIP starts from the first marker and the last marker of each path in the CR with an empty initial scr respectively as long as these markers are not intersection markers. This is depicted on lines 1-9, where we calculate the overall length and number of accidents in CR , and traverse from the first marker and the last marker of each path in the CR .The detailed traversal process is showed on lines 17-37. For ev-ery marker that we encounter on a given path, we simply add this marker in the scr . When the marker is an inter-section marker, we further separate the way by traversing forward and backward respectively on paths that intersect with the current path at this intersection marker. In addi-tion, we also continue to traverse the rest part of the current path. This process stops when no more markers are left in the current path or it encounters a marker that is already containedinthe scr . We recursively traverse all the paths in the CR . After the traversal ends, we slide over all pos-sible varying size scan windows in scr as depicted on lines 10-16 and invoke the LSSC procedure to compute the lin-ear scan statistic  X  , as outlined in Algorithm 2. The window traversal on lines 11-15 is adapted from the LS 3 algorithm as discussed in [13]. Once the window is determined, the  X  value is computed and compared to the existing highest  X  value to discover the anomalous window. r Algorithm 1 SSLIP : Scan Statistic for Linear Intersecting Paths
BF-SSLIP algorithm adopts a similar technique to Apriori [26] to identify all connected marker combinations c in CR , where these combinations are arbitrary shaped scan win-dows. A combination of markers c i is comprised of a set of markers such that c i = { m r j 1  X  X  X  m r k l } ,where r j and all markers in c i are connected. BF-SSLIP method is summarized in Algorithm 3. Essentially BF-SSLIP consid-ers connected marker combinations and merges the marker combinations similar to the way frequent itemsets are gen-erated in the Apriori algorithm. However BF-SSLIP has a high time complexity because the marker combinations do not exhibit an anti monotone property in their arrangement. Algorithm 2 LSSC: Linear Scan Statistic Computa-tion
Building on the BF-SSLIP, CBF-SSLIP algorithm is de-signed for speeding up the identification of arbitrary shaped scan windows centered around intersection markers. For this algorithm we define central cross paths ccr generated from CR . Let us consider a CR which comprises of three paths r ccr 1 , ccr 2 will be generated from this CR such that r 1 tirely in ccr 1 and part of r 2 which stops before its intersec-tion with r 3 is in ccr 1 .Nowin ccr 2 all of r 3 is included. However only part of r 2 which stops before its intersection with r 1 is in ccr 2 . ThisisshowninFigure2(c).
 Algorithm 4 depicts the CCR generation on line 2 where CR is separated into multiple ccr s, where each ccr is com-prised of certain number of path segments and one intersec-tion marker. Now consider a cross intersection ccr i which has p number of path segments r i . For marker combinations that don X  X  contain the intersection marker, we can simply identify them by scanning each r i . For marker combinations that contain the intersection marker we define something called as sub-central cross paths sccr ccr i i . CBF-SSLIP iden-tifies these sccr ccr i i through a iterative process. The process is showed in Algorithm 4 on lines 7-24. The identification starts with a 1-marker combination which contain the inter-section marker only. Then in each iteration, one k-marker combination generates at most p number of (k+1)-marker combinations by adding one marker from each r i into the combination if there still are markers left in that r i .The iterative process stops when no more markers can be added into the combination. Monte Carlo Simulation is used for a test of significance. We define the null hypothesis H 0 , which states that the groupings discovered by the linear scan statistic in the data are random or by chance alone. To prove that our discovery is not a random result, but indeed reflects the real state of affairs, we compute the p-value, a well-known statistical test to prove that the result is not a random occurrence. Essen-Algorithm 3 BF:SSLIP tially, the p-value of a statistical test is the probability of obtaining a value of a given linear scan statistic  X  as equally or more extreme than that observed by chance alone. In other words, the linear scan statistic  X  is associated with a p-value to decide whether or not the null hypothesis should be rejected in the hypothesis test.

If the p-value is large the data supports the null hypoth-esis. This is determined by the level of significance, which is generally between 1% to 5%. Thus if p-value is less than .01 or .05 then H 0 can be rejected and the result is sig-nificant. For the computation of p-value, values of behav-ioral attribute associated with the markers are shifted, while keeping the coordinates of one-dimensional spatial locations unchanged. The linear scan statistic is computed again with the shifted data to obtain  X  value. This process is repeated sufficiently large number of times resulting in the Monte Carlo Simulations. The position of the original  X  in the list of  X  values determines the p-value. This process is outlined in Algorithm 5. Experiments were performed on a 2.50GHZ HP notebook PC with 2G of memory, running Windows Vista 32-bit. All algorithms were implemented in Java and running on JRE 1.60. The experimental data was stored on a SATA 5400 RPM internal hard drive. The algorithm code is available from [27]. The entire datasets we used is available from [21]. We report results obtained fro m experimental data, and then compare and evaluate our methods. The following metrics are used in evaluation and comparison:(a) Accuracy of iden-tifying accident hubs from intersections with known issues, (b) Likelihood ratio - X  value, (c) Statistical significance-p-value, (d) Running time, and (e) Memory cost. Below we discuss our experiments in details.
 Algorithm 4 CBF:SSLIP
Our experimental data consists of seven datasets as shown in Table 2. All of them are extracted from the raw data of 1998 and 1999 crash records from the New Jersey Depart-ment of Transportation website [21]. Such records are also used for analysis by transportational experts [31]. These crash records list detailed crash data which contains crash location with the exact milepost on routes for most crashes in 21 counties in New Jersey from 1998 to 1999. We use these one dimensional crash locations as markers for each route in our datasets, where each marker is associated with the location X  X  spatial coordinates in the form of a milepost and number of accidents occurred. In addition, we also gathered data regarding the exact mileposts where routes intersect with each other, from Wikipedia and Straight Line Diagrams that are available f rom New Jersey Department of Transportation as well [24]. Table 2 summarizes the key characteristics of each of the dataset. Some of these datasets such as Dataset 1,2,3,4, involve only two routes. Dataset 5 is much more complex with 4 intersecting routes. Dataset 6 and 7 are subsets of dataset 2 and 3 which are used to facilitate the processing of BF-SSLIP and CBF-SSLIP con-sidering their high time complexity. These two datasets only keep a certain number of markers around the intersections and discard the others. Each of the routes we selected in datasets have had known issues along certain mileposts as discussed in the report from NJDOT [30]. We consider these mileposts with known issues, which we refer to as known windows, as labels for a qualitative analysis of our results. This will help us to not only support the quantitative re-sults we find namely  X  and p-value for the anomalous win-dows but also show if our approach is effective in discovering actionable knowledge in real world datasets. Algorithm 5 Monte Carlo Simulation
In the following, we first discuss the quality of results ob-tained by the SSLIP algorithm, and then compare the per-formance of SSLIP with other two algorithms BF-SSLIP and CBF-SSLIP using the metrics listed earlier. Lastly, we eval-uate SSLIP under different parameter settings. Note that NJDOT crash dataset is used as a test-bed to measure the efficacy of the data mining algorithms. The windows dis-covered may complement the domain experts analysis and should not be used independently to imply conclusive results for accident hubs along highways. Further analysis with the domain expert will be required to validate the implications of the windows discovered.
As presented in the Table 3, all the anomalous windows that SSLIP method discovered accurately identified the ac-cident hubs listed in State accidents severity report for 1998 and 1999. We discuss results in terms of how our approach handles single and multiple intersections and incomplete data -sets.
 Single Intersection: The intersection of U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 130 at the milepost 24.6 of U.S. Route 1 was identified to have known traffic issues [30]. By scanning the dataset 1 comprising of these routes, SSLIP discovered the anomalous window between milepost 24.57 and 24.77 of U.S. Route 1. This anomalous window precisely covers the known window within 0.2 mile that is already the narrowest width possible under our setting. Its associated  X  is 18.450 and the p-value is 0.060. From the statistical perspective, this p-value is not good enough. It may be because U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 130 are both major transportation routes, there may exist other accident hubs containing markers with large number of accidents on these two routes. Thus it is very likely that these large number of accidents could be randomly shifted into adjacent markers forming anomalous windows with higher  X  than the original one. For dataset 2, dataset 3 and dataset 4, SSLIP also all accurately iden-tified the known windows on these routes from [30] within its anomalous windows. The widths of three windows are precisely 0.2 mile, 0.21 mile and 0.21 mile with  X  values of 16.041, 22.140 and 11.669 respectively. Their p-values are all 0.001 which prove the statistical significance of our discoveries and hence the windows SSLIP found indeed rep-resent statistically significant windows which match known windows with traffic issues.
 Multiple Intersections: Above four datasets are all single intersection datasets, next we evaluate SSLIP method with a more complex multiple intersection dataset. Note that for situations of multiple intersections and multiple accident hubs, SSLIP naturally discovers the most dangerous acci-dent hub in them. In dataset 5, where all three intersections were reported as known windows and ranked 26th, 23rd and 26th respectively in State seve rity report, SSLIP accurately identified the highest severity ranking accident hub of U.S. Route 1/9 and NJ Route 139 intersection at milepost 54.5 of U.S. Route 1/9 within its anomalous window from milepost 54.48 to 54.68 of U.S. Route 1/9. The associated  X  is 9.852 and p-value is 0.056 for this window. Similar to dataset 1, the anomalous window is also not as statistically signifi-cant as the previous three windows discovered in dataset 2, dataset 3 and dataset 4. As we mentioned before, other ac-cident hubs could be a possible factor affecting the p-value of the result. In this case, the existence of the other two high ranking intersections might be the reason for the less statistical significance of this anomalous window. Incomplete Datasets: Even for largely incomplete datasets which only contain small portion of markers around acci-dent hubs, SSLIP is still able to identify correct accident hubs within its anomalous window. For example, as shown in Table 3, the anomalous window discovered in dataset 6 is between milepost 3.4 of NJ Route 4 and milepost 12.47 of NJ Route 17, where the known window is at milepost 3.3 of NJ Route 4 which is precisely covered by SSLIP window, and the anomalous window discovered in dataset 7 is be-tween milepost 23.92 of NJ Route 73 and milepost 8.32 of NJ Route 70, which identified known window at milepost 8.3 of NJ Route 70 as well. Note that datset 6 and dataset 7 only contain about 16% and 12% number of markers com-paring to the complete datasets. Moreover, the p-values of these two SSLIP windows are 0.004 and 0.006 respectively, which prove their statistical significance.

All above experimental results validate the accuracy and efficacy of SSLIP method in terms of identifying known win-dows. Below, we compare SSLIP with the other algorithms proposed in this paper, to show its effectiveness.
Unlike SSLIP which discovers directional anomalous win-dows, BF-SSLIP and CBF-SSLIP methods are able to dis-cover arbitrary shaped anomalous windows. However, due to high time complexity, the time cost would become unac-ceptable for experiments when the size of testing datasets goes large. Therefore, we compared SSLIP to BF-SSLIP and CBF-SSLIP only on smaller single intersection datasets namely dataset 6 and 7. Note that BF-SSLIP and CBF-SSLIP generate same output when handling single intersec-tion datasets.
Arbitrary Shaped Window: The results obtained from dataset 6 are summarized in the Table 4. As we can see, BF-SSLIP and CBF-SSLIP discovered the same T-shaped anomalous window between milepost 3.33 to milepost 3.4 of NJ Route 4 and milepost 12.34 to milepost 12.45 of NJ Route 17 with the highest  X  value of 8.060 and p-value of 0.001, where the intersection of NJ Route 4 and NJ Route 17 is at milepost 3.34 of Route 4 and milepost 12.33 of Route 17. It demonstrates that BF-SSLIP and CBF-SSLIP can discover arbitrary shaped anomalous windows. On the other hand, SSLIP discovered the directional anomalous window between milepost 3.4 to milepost 12.47 of NJ Route 17 with a  X  value of 7.954 and a p-value of 0.004. Hence, BF-SSLIP, CBF-SSLIP and SSLIP all accurately identified the known accident hub at milepost 3.3 of NJ Route 4 with statistically significant windows. Although their anomalous windows are not exactly the same, comparing the  X  value of BF-SSLIP, CBF-SSLIP window and SSLIP window, the difference is less than 2%, which indicates that SSLIP window is almost as precise as BF-SSLIP and CBF-SSLIP window. And the huge advantages of SSLIP show when we look at the time and memory costs of these three methods. As presented in Table 4, for dataset 6, SSLIP spent 97 seconds to finish anomalous window discovery and 999 iterations of Monte Carlo simulations, where BF-SSLIP and CBF-SSLIP took 1068779 and 22798 seconds respectively, which are 11018 and 235 times the running time of SSLIP. For memory cost, SSLIP X  X  8672k is only about 7% of BF-SSLIP X  X  114012k and 10% of CBF-SSLIP X  X  84094k.
Similarly for dataset 7, as showed in Table 5, BF-SSLIP and CBF-SSLIP accurately covered the known window at milepost 8.3 of NJ Route 70 in their cross shaped anoma-lous windows and SSLIP also identified it within its direc-tional anomalous window. The difference of their  X  value is less than 2% and all these windows have low p-values. The time and memory costs for SSLIP are still much less than these for BF-SSLIP and CBF-SSLIP. Figure 3 and Figure 4 clearly show SSLIP X  X  huge advantages in terms of costs as compared to BF-SSLIP, CBF-SSLIP. In summary, SSLIP essentially performs far more effectively and efficiently than BF-SSLIP and CBF-SSLIP with almost no loss of accuracy and precision.
Minimum width of anomalous window is the only model parameter used in the SSLIP approach. This parameter ap-points a starting point by way of minimum width of the window, although the window size is varying. By compari-son, we found that the initial window size between 0.1 mile and 0.2 mile balance the accuracy with the precision best. In experiments presented above, the minimum width of anoma-lous window was set to 0.2 mile for all methods.
In this paper, we proposed an approach for discovering anomalous windows using S can S tatistics for L inear I ntersect -ing P aths (SSLIP). We presented extensive experimental results in real world accident datasets for various highways with known issues. Our results indicated that our approach indeed is effective in identifying anomalous traffic accident windows along multiple intersecting highways and the SSLIP algorithms is the most efficient and effective in doing so. We would like to compare our approach with various spatial scan statistics methods such as [4,14,15,28]. In this approach we have looked at the spatial aspect of this data. We would like to explore the spatio temporal aspect of this analysis by performing an unequal width discretization of the data along the temporal dimension and performing the analysis in each of the discrete intervals. It will be interesting to see the efficacy of this novel research that can have a far reach-ing impact on several real world applications such as traffic, pipelines, railroads and so on.
