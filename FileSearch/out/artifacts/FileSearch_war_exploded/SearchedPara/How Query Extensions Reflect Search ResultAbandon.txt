 It is often considered that high abandonment rate corre-sponds to poor IR system performance. However several studies suggested that there are so called good abandon-ments , i.e. situations when search engine result page contains enough details to satisfy the user information need without necessitytoclickonsearchresults.Inthisworkwepropose to look at query extensions. We will show that an extension by itself might motivate abandonment type ( good or bad ) for the underlying query to some degree. We also propose a way to find potentially good abandonment extensions in an automated manner.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Experimentation, Verification, Human Factors query log analysis, query reformulation, search result aban-donments
Abandonment rate is one of the most broadly used online user satisfaction metrics to evaluate the quality of informa-tion retrieval (IR) system. It is often considered that high abandonment rate corresponds to poor IR system perfor-mance. However in [4] it was suggested that some abandon-ments might be good : user decided not to click on search results because her information need were satisfied with a search engine result page (SERP) itself. Such situations were further studied in [3] where cursor movements were proposed to measure user satisfaction when no clicks had been issued. In all previous works authors relied on human judgements to decide whether particular query resulted in a good abandonment or not without evaluating actual user be-havior. Work [1] even suggested that users tend to go to the original document (click on the page/URL) even if the snip-pet shows the information they were needed. So, we wanted to find real-world evidence for these good abandonments.
We started with the query log of a large commercial search engine. We extracted queries that were issued at least 10 times in 10-days period and calculated abandonment rate. We say that the query q was abandoned if it was not followed by any click on a search result item X  X  url/image. If we had some clickable ads or Answers 1 present we counted these clicks as usual. If the query was followed by another search request and user did not return to the query q we still mark q as abandoned.

After that we performed automated extraction of query extensions. If query q matched pattern  X  sq  X  X r X  qs  X  X or some query q and some suffix/prefix s ( s consists of one or more words) and queries q and q were both present in our dataset D ,wesaidthat q is an extended query for q : q = e ( q ), where function e is parametrized by either suffix or prefix. Then we compared abandonment rates a for the query q and its extended variant q . For each extension e we calculated the following value:
If the value is greater than 1 we may claim that this partic-ular extension e increases abandonment rate, being applied to the query. We have an intuition that some query ex-tensions may correspond to very specific information needs that can easily be answered directly on a search engine re-sult page. The top and the bottom  X  values are presented in Table 1.

We performed hand labeling of 190 popular query ex-tensions found in our dataset 2 . The question was simi-lar to that used in [4] to find potential good abandonment queries:  X  X iven an extension e is it true that queries with such an extension have a dominant information need that could theoretically be achieved by an internet search engine result page? X . As in [4] possible answers were  X  X es X ,  X  X o X  or  X  X aybe X . In order to confirm correlation of  X  value and potential good abandonment label we sorted all extensions according to  X  (in descending order) and split them to 10 bins of equal size. Label distribution in each bin is visual-ized in the Figure 1. We can see that the portion of potential good abandonments decreases with decrease of  X  while the portion of potential bad abandonments increases. Some de-viations from this trend may be motivated by poor search
As in [2] we use the notion of Answers : specially designed search result items.
Queries with such extensions represent 4% of all search engine traffic. result quality, unusual user behavior or the expert X  X  uncer-tainty.

It is important to note that we did not perform labeling of the SERPs (we labeled extensions only). As it was shown in [1] user behavior on good-looking SERPs may not neces-sarily result in abandonment: 68% of participants said that they still click on the page/URL even if the snippet shows the information they were looking for. So we decided to have clean assessors instructions in order to avoid problems with rating process.

We also experimented with a somewhat different task. We provided assessors not only with extension itself but also with a small sample of extended queries 3 with this exten-sion. That different task resulted in almost identical label-ing and we decided not to include the results to this work. It was interesting finding that information contained in an extension itself is generally sufficient to determine potential abandonment type.

CORRELATION . In order to compute numerical repre-sentation of the results shown in the Figure 1 we calculated correlation value of potential abandonment type and  X  .For each extension e i we computed x i =  X  i  X  1and Once we have two vectors x and y we can compute correla-tion coefficient:
Corr ( x, y )= where w is a weight vector. we used 10 Figure 1:  X  and Potential Good Abandonments
If we used unit weight vector, we got correlation equal to 0.507 .Whenweset w i equal to the number of different queries used with the extension e i we got correlation equal to 0.518 .
In this paper we performed analysis of query extensions and their effects on query abandonments. We found that some extensions usually result in higher abandonment rate while others decrease abandonment rate dramatically. By performing hand labeling we found that median abandon-ment ratio is correlated with potential abandonment type of the extension: potentially bad extensions decrease aban-donment rate while potentially good extensions increase it. These results may be exploited by search engines to im-prove Answers quality 4 . Now rules to fire an Answer are usually selected by humans and do not necessarily reflect actual user needs. In this work we showed that queries with several extensions (with high  X  value) are very likely to be good abandonments and therefore are good candidates to be presented with Answers . For this task we need to filter out queries with Answer already present and sort the exten-sions according to the  X  value. We did not show the results here, but they look very similar giving us weighted correla-tion with potential good abandonment equal to 0.588 and unweighted correlation equal to 0.469 . [1] O.
