 1. Introduction
In this research, we investigate learning theory for understanding information searching. Specifically, we aim to dis-cover an inferential framework based on learning theory for indentifying the cognitive category of a searcher X  X  need based on characteristics of the information searching process. By information searching, we mean  X  X  X he  X  X icro-level X  of behavior employed by the searcher in interacting with an information system X  (Wilson, 2000, p. 49 ). While many have studied individual differences in information searching (c.f., Saracevic, 1991 ), no one has proposed a model that relates individual differences to information searching. Saracevic comments,  X  X  X e are still lacking a theoretical frame-work and/or explanation for all these findings (concerning individual differences). Without such a framework, the work on individual differences in (information retrieval) will continue to proceed as in the past, using a shotgun approach. X  (Saracevic, 1991 , p. 85). Ford, Miller, and Moss (2003) make similar assertions concerning the need for such a concep-tual model.
There has been prior work on classifying individual searching tasks rather than the specific need that generates these tasks. Several researchers have investigated individual searching tasks classifications. For example, MacMullin and Taylor (1984) present a classification of information seeking tasks. Bystr X m and J X rvelin (1995) explore the relationship between task and complexity in a work environment. Rose and Levinson (2004) present a classification of Web searching tasks based task research stream); however, our focus is in discovering a framework for classifying the underlying need that leads to a specific searching task.

The most commonly presented frameworks for understanding information searching needs are problem solving and decision making. Donohew and Tipton (1973) comment on the close relationship between information seeking (of which information searching is a component) and decision making (p. 251). March (1994) distinguishes between decision mak-ing and problem solving, commenting that searching relates directly to making decisions. Many other researchers have investigated aspects of information searching from a decision making or problem solving perspective (c.f., Belkin, 1988; Kraft, 1973; Lopatovska, 2007), and Case (2007) provides a review of decision making research for information seeking research.

However, the recognition of problem solving as a conceptual framework for information searching is not universally ac-cepted. Sperber and Wilson (1995) argue that problem solving does not apply to all information searching situations. More solving. Most of the published works that discuss the relationship between decision making and searching are descriptive in nature (i.e., the proposed decision making model is not predictive). Few laboratory studies linking information searching behaviors with decision making currently exist.

Some researchers have questioned whether decision making and searching are actually related. For example, in investi-gating the relationship between decision making and information searching, Jansen and McNeese (2005) administered the Problem Solving Inventory (PSI) survey instrument to approximately 40 participants of an information searching study. The
Jansen and McNeese (2005) showed no statistically significant relationship between problem solving self-efficacy and searching performance or between perceptions of problem solving ability and searching characteristics. If prior work on information searching as a problem solving activity is correct, one would expect some relationship between problem solving
Based on these findings, we sought potential approaches other than problem solving or decision making to describe accu-rately the information searching process.

One likely potential approach is that searching is a learning process. Schmeck (1988), p. 3 defines learning as  X  X  X n inter-manent change in behavior potential that occurs as a result of experience X . Bloom, Englehard, Furst, and Krathwohl (1956) state that learning occurs at the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains.
 ing-by-doing X  (1916) is often used to provide the pedagogical underpinning for interactive learning environments. Wittrock (1974) describes the process of knowledge construction in which the learner relates new information to old, building en-hanced knowledge structures. Yankelovich, Meyrowitz, and van Dam (1985) draw an analogy between education and hyper-related to both problem solving and learning (p. 5 X 6). Budhu and Coleman (2002) consider information processing as a fun-damental cognitive activity underlying the process of learning.
 Are there specific searching behaviors that one can map to a particular learning model? If so, what are these mappings? lowing sections, we present a literature review of learning as a model for understanding information searching, followed by search aims. 2. Review of literature
Information need is a core concept of information science (Wilson, 1981 ) and typically refers to the underlying motivation ing the evaluation of the usefulness, relevance, and authority of retrieved content in searching. As such, a better cause individuals to engage in searching. 2.1. Searching as learning
The information science literature contains some hints of learning as a vehicle for understanding people X  X  needs ( Leh-mann, 1999; Zhang, Jansen, &amp; Spink, 2006 ), although many times the learning element is subsumed within other frame-works, including sense making and searching in online environments.

In a sense-making paradigm, Dervin (1992) defines information need as something constructed internally to address a sense-making is theoretically grounded in the constructivist learning theories of Dewey (1933) . Dewey argued that learning can only occur through problem solving. Similarly, Kuhlthau X  X  information seeking process (1993) includes a significant tion seeking is caused by the introduction of new information that conflicts with previously held constructs. Kuhlthau does process.

Defining learning as the development of new knowledge, Marchionini (2006) elaborates on the learning elements inher-evaluation of retrieved results. The researcher specifically employs terminology from Bloom X  X  categorization to describe attributes of learning while searching for information.
 Some researchers have investigated elements of learning within a searching framework using empirical methods. Hill and
Hannafin (1997) attempt to identify strategies that adult learners employ when using a hypermedia information system. The to affect the strategies employed. Budhu and Coleman (2002) propose that Web technologies allow for interactive learning environments that in turn can foster an increased understanding of science and engineering concepts.

Continuing this empirical line of research, Tang (2002) analyzed the searching behaviors of 41 public library patrons and categorized them into two groups based on their exhibited searching strategies, either resource-oriented or query-oriented. query reformulation. Halttunen (2003) studied whether there were relationships between learning style, academic domain, tions of information retrieval understanding. The students who were primarily concrete learners reported computer skills and information retrieval methods as important. Students who were reflective learners viewed information retrieval as the knowledge of information needs analysis, methods, and assessment.

Tsai and Tsai (2003) explored the relationship among students X  information searching strategies in Web-based science learning activities and the influence of students X  Internet self-efficacy. The researchers reported that students with high the similarity between the features of the Web and those characterizing creative individuals, Shoshani and Hazi (2007) pos-
Focusing on query construction as a learning process, Zhang et al. (2006) discuss the similarities between the linguistic characteristics of query formulation and learning to formulate words in a spoken language. Most queries are lists of one or nouns before predicate terms X  (1982, p. 327) and  X  X  X n early-production vocabularies, nouns greatly outnumber verbs X  (p. nouns to articulate their needs. Researchers in cognitive science also pointed out that, in many languages, nouns have pro-totypical functions in discourses X  (Lakoff, 1987, p. 64 ).

Related to learning, Ford et al. (2003) have investigated the influence of study habits, building from a series of pre-electronic environment. The researchers reported that comprehension learners used broader search strategies while operational learners used narrower strategies. In a subsequent study on the relationship between preferred study habits and searching strategy, Wood et al. (1996) found that comprehension learners used a greater number of searches, more new terms, and more unique terms. These students were also more aware of search techniques for broadening or nar-rowing the query. Ford et al. (2001) investigated the association between individual differences at the cognitive level on searching outcome. Ford et al. (2003) investigated to what extent the selection of search strategies is influenced by study approaches. Using factor analysis, the researchers found correlations with the use of Boolean searching by ac-tively intereste d but anxious individuals. Students who were effective time managers used either Boolean or best match.

Previous research has postulated the relationship between searching and learning; however, limited prior empirical re-exhibited information searching behavior, we can understand the nature of the underlying information need ( Allen, 1996 ), and importantly, we can posit a learning process as an appropriate model to view information searching. To accomplish this we employed an established taxonomy of cognitive learning and a survey of individual learning styles as a possible moder-ating effect. 2.2. Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  refine to Bloom X  X  taxonomy
One of the most widely accepted cognitive learning frameworks is Bloom X  X  taxonomy. In 1956, a team of educational the-
Bloom X  X  taxonomy is now a well known classification of learning in the cognitive domain (Bloom et al., 1956 ). Bloom X  X  tax-initial publication, a number of investigations have examined the theoretical validity of Bloom X  X  taxonomy with mixed re-use, the taxonomy is regarded as a functional and, therefore, successful tool (Seddon, 1978 ).

One of the governing principles of the taxonomy is its descriptive scheme in which every type of learning goal can be mine the level of existing questions. However, one can also use the taxonomy to develop appropriate questions for each le-which is the specific taxonomy that we employed in this research. 2.3. Individual learning styles
It is widely acknowledged that people have a variety of preferences when they learn and process information, and there are many learning style systems to describe and categorize such preferences (c.f., Felder &amp; Silverman, 1988;
McCarthy, 1980 ). Therefore, we believed that we had to assess the learning styles of the individuals in some way. For this research, we desired a survey instrument that would identify a searcher X  X  general learning style, so we selected a simpli-similar learning style approach was used by (Halttunen, 2003 ), so we this provides some comparison among findings.
Kolb X  X  learning theory articulates four distinct learning preferences and is based on a four-stage learning cycle. For the and reflections are assimilated and distilled into abstract concepts producing new implications for action which can be ac-tively tested, creating new experiences (Kolb, 1985 ).

The simplified test (Al-Mahmood et al., 1998 ) identifies one X  X  preferred processing and perception styles and is adapted trums. The active/reflective spectrum refers to how the person processes information, and the abstract/concrete spectrum ter et al. (1998), p. 58 and Al-Mahmood et al. (1998) .

We selected Kolb X  X  experiential learning theory model because the four-stage learning model fits nicely with the concept of information searching and the data-information-knowledge-wisdom (Ackoff, 1989 ) classification. Additionally, Kolb X  X  experiential learning theory model is aimed specifically at adult learners, which fit the demographic population from which we would draw our sample. We selected a simplified version of instrument, as assessment of learning styles was not our main research focus but a moderating component.
 3. Research questions and hypotheses
A variety of information science models address the concept of individual differences and interaction with information and infer the learning context underlying the information need. As such, this research will significantly inform aspects of various models of information searching, including search tactics and cognitive aspects of the searcher.
To these aims, we specifically address two research questions. 3.1. Research question I: are searching episodes learning events? order to analyze this question, we used Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  (2001) redesign of Bloom X  X  taxonomy of learning in the cognitive domain to develop searching tasks for each of the six categories within the taxonomy. In a user study, we then analyzed the exhibited searching characteristics of each searching category with established online searching parameters to detect if there were differences in exhibited searching behavior.

Prior to design the research study, we had to operationalize this research question. During the normal interaction be-tween a searcher and Web search engine during information searching, there are a limited number of measures that occur sen, Taksa, &amp; Spink, 2008 ), we investigate seven hypotheses addressing this research question, which are: Hypothesis 1. There will be a significant difference in the number of queries per session among the classifications in Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy.
 Hypothesis 2. There will be a significant difference in the average query length per session among the classifications in Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy.
 Hypothesis 3. There will be a significant difference in the number of unique terms per session among the classifications in Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy.

Our first three hypotheses focus on the query. Although an acknowledged imprecise representation of the underlying information need (Croft &amp; Thompson, 1987 ), the query is the central aspect of information searching and information retrieval (Robertson, 1977; van Rijsbergen, 1975 ). Numerous empirical studies have focused on the various aspects of (Wang et al., 2003 ), and use of keywords ( Wolfram, 1999 ). Therefore, we believe the number of queries per session, query length, and number of unique terms used in the session are appropriate searching characteristics for this study. We define a session as the series of interactions between the searcher and information system(s) while addressing one of the given searching scenarios.
 Hypothesis 4. There will be a significant difference in the number of topics per session among the classifications in Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy.

For simple information needs, a one-to-one correlation usually exists between need and topic. For complex information needs, one or more topics may comprise the overall need. Due to the dynamics and complexity of the Web information environment, people are becoming more involved in coordinating multiple searching behaviors ( Waller, 1997 ). Studies also indicate that users X  searches may have multiple goals, topics, or problems in information seeking and retrieval con-texts ( Miwa, 2001; Spink, 2004 ). Therefore, this hypothesis examines the number of topics searched in a given session. Hypothesis 5. There will be a significant difference in the duration of sessions among the classifications in Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy.

Time on a system has been a consistent measure of information searching and retrieval studies as one of a variety of indic-2000).

Hypothesis 6. There will be a significant difference in the number of result pages viewed per session among the classifications in Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy.

The number of result pages viewed is one aspect of implicit feedback used to determine the level of difficulty of a searching task or how well a searching system is satisfying a user X  X  information need. Researchers have explored var-ious aspects of interactions as measurements of implicit feedback. For example, Goecks and Shivalik (2000) used hyper-links clicked, scrolling performed, and processor cycles consumed. Seo and Zhang (2000) studied reading time, scroll-ing, link selection, and bookmarking as potential implicit feedbacks and found that bookmarking had the strongest relationship with interesting documents, but scrolling had no relationship. Claypool and colleagues ( Claypool, Le,
Waseda, &amp; Brown, 2001 ) measured mouse clicks, mouse movement, scrolling, and elapsed time as the implicit feedback metrics. Kelly and Belkin (2001) studied reading time, scrolling, and interaction. Kelly and Belkin (2004) also examined the display time as the implicit feedback and found no direct relationship between the display time and the usefulness of documents. Shen, Tan, and Zhai (2005) employed previous queries and clickthrough information as the implicit feed-back measures.
 Hypothesis 7. There will be a significant difference in the number of search systems used among the classifications in Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy.

Anderson and Krathwohl (2001), p. 85 state that the higher order learning processes are multiple phases and that the stu-dent draws upon elements from many sources, piecing them together, crafting a novel structure or pattern relative to prior knowledge. As such, we are interested in the number of information systems used, expecting that higher order clas-sification will require more systems than the lower order classifications require. We define an information system as a mechanism for acquiring, storing. Indexing, and retrieving an organized body of data, information, or knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia, WebMD, HowStuffWork). We also include search engines in this definition (e.g., Ask, Googe, MSN Live,
Yahoo!). learning style?
While research question one is the major focus of the paper, research question two addresses possible moderating effects controlling for learning styles.
 Hypothesis 8. There will be a difference in exhibited searching characteristics based on learning styles.
One would expect some difference among learning styles in exhibited searching behaviors, although there would be ben-such as an information searching scenario. Halttunen (2003) reports that learning styles generate differences in informa-tion retrieval self-efficacy. Therefore, we would expect some differences in searching characteristics among searchers with difference learning styles. Some other information searching and seeking studies have highlighted that individual learning styles may affect aspects of the searching process (Ford et al., 1994; Wood et al., 1996 ). For this hypothesis, we investigate the information searching characteristics of queries per session, topics per session, duration of session, query length, number of unique terms, number of result pages, and number of search systems used. 4. Methods
As the foundational elements for our research, we draw on constructs of learning levels in the cognitive domain and pre-and Kolb X  X  learning styles (Kolb, 1985 ). 4.1. Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  Taxonomy
For this research, we devised two searching scenarios for each of the six-levels of Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy, and travel) to provide a common grounding for the participants as they moved through the searching scenarios.
We pilot-tested the scenarios twice before using them in a laboratory study. Similar to Bloom X  X , Anderson and Kra-the complete list of searching scenarios presented in Appendix A .
Budhu and Coleman (2002) suggest that information use behaviors for learning can be indentified using educational the-ories. We take the opposite approach, namely deducing levels of learning based on online searching behaviors.
We use the phrase searching scenarios to be consistent with user study literature calling for information searching re-needs and information tasks. Defining what is an information need or task has been the subject of much debate and with taxonomy was the most appropriate approach.

Developing questions based on Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy is not straightforward. Although the categories re-ment process for each level.

Our scenario development went through several rounds of redesign before we arrived at a set that we were happy with implementing in a study. After two rounds of pilot testing, we were comfortable that our scenarios were in line with the learning levels for our target demographic of traditional college age students. There are several guides for writing objec-tives using Bloom X  X  and Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  learning taxonomies. In addition to published works, we utilized the guidelines from the Center for Teaching and Learning at the University of North Caroline  X  Charlotte. lines for implementing Bloom X  X  and Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  learning taxonomies take similar approaches, namely a link-age from the learning level  X  to keywords  X  to questions or objectives. We followed this approach for our scenario generation. 4.2. Kolb X  X  learning styles then totaled the columns, providing preferences for each of the learning styles. See Appendix B for the complete survey instrument. 4.3. User study procedure
To investigate our research questions, we conducted a quantitative study using a laboratory experimental design. A con-&amp; Shepherd, 2007; Meadow, 1982; Toms, Dufour, &amp; Hesemeier, 2004 ).

Over the course of two weeks, 72 participants engaged in a laboratory study (59 males and 13 females; mean age 20 years with a standard deviation of 1.9 years). Concerning, the imbalance of gender, Hupfer and Detlor (2006) found no gender dif-self-rating their searching expertise a mean 4.1 on a five-point scale (standard deviation 0.5).

A moderator first had each participant complete administrative and demographic paperwork. Then, the moderator pre-sented each participant with six searching scenarios and instructed them to answer the questions and verify their answers. The six searching scenarios were each on an individual sheet of paper with blank spaces on the sheet for answers or notes.
We imposed no time limit on searching sessions. We counterbalanced the searching scenarios among the participants using a Graeco-Latin square approach. At the conclusion of the searching session, the moderator administered the learning style inventory to the participants.

During the study, participants recorded their answers to the searching scenarios on the worksheets. Each participant had
Once all participants had completed the study, we analyzed participant interactions in accordance with standard characteristics of information searching using transaction log analysis as the methodological approach and ANOVA for the statistical evaluation. We analyzed the data using SPSS version 15. We employed the parametric tests, ANOVA, rather than non-parametric tests, such as the Wilcoxon signed test, because the parametric tests are more stringent in their analysis. The main advantage of using non-parametric tests is they do not need data in normal distribution. However,
Hull (1993) has shown that the parametric tests performed extremely well with skewed and non-parametric data, rec-ommends that they be used whenever possible, and are well-suited for the use in studies such as this one. 5. Results
In the following sections, we report our results and examine if there is any differences in searching characteristics among

 We used a one-way ANOVA statistical analysis to compare means and variance among the classifications. The one-way ences. Tamhane X  X  T2 Test does not assume equal variances among the samples.
Tamhane X  X  T2 results indicate that the collection of learning tasks classified as applying was significantly different from different from the others would be a fully supported hypothesis.

There will be a significant difference in the average query length per session among the classifications in Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy.

There will be a significant difference in the number of unique terms per session among the classifications in Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy.

Again using a one-way ANOVA, our results indicate that there is a significant difference among the groups ( F (5) = 3.34, for each of the six classifications. 5.1.4. Topics per session Hypothesis 4. There will be a significant difference in the number of topics per session among the classifications in Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy.

Using a one-way ANOVA, our results indicate that there is a significant difference among the groups ( F (5) = 8.613, ported. Fig. 1 shows the mean topics per sessions of the six classifications. 5.1.5. Duration of session Hypothesis 5. There will be a significant difference in the duration of sessions among the classifications in Anderson and
Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy.
Again using a one-way ANOVA, our results indicate that there is a significant difference among the groups ( F (5) = 2.68, of remembering . Hypothesis 5, therefore, is partially supported. Fig. 4 shows the mean durations of sessions for each of the six classifications. 5.1.6. Result pages view per session
Hypothesis 6. There will be a significant difference in the number of result pages viewed per session among the classifications in Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy.

Again using a one-way ANOVA, our results indicate that there is a significant difference among the groups ( F (5) = 2.26, viewed for each of six classifications. 5.1.7. Systems used per session Hypothesis 7. There will be a significant difference in the number of search systems used among the classifications in Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy.

Again using a one-way ANOVA, our results indicate that there is a significant difference among the groups ( F (5) = 2.21, of remembering and evaluating . Hypothesis 7 , therefore, is partially supported. Fig. 6 shows the mean number of systems for each of six classifications.

The distribution of systems that the participants used is interesting because of the predominance of Google as the main the searching scenarios. Table 4 shows the use of systems for all searching scenarios for all participants in the study.
As shown in Table 4 , there were 495 total instances of use of 33 systems. The general-purpose search engine, Google, rep-resented more than 72% of all instances of use. Most participants used one information system to address the searching sce-narios, along with some destination Website or page. However, more than 18% of the participants used two systems, with the
Website an information system or just a  X  X ocument X ? Based on our definition of information system, for this research, we have included the general-purpose search engines. 5.1.8. Second research question
Research Question 2: Are searching characteristics within Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy affected by the learning style of the searcher? Table 5 shows the numbers of the participants in each learning style.

From Table 5 , more than 45% of the participants were concrete learners, although there where sizable numbers of reflec-way ANOVA and Tamhane X  X  T2 Test to compare group means to identify specific differences. Our results are reported in Table 6.
 We did not perform post hoc tests for concrete  X  active and concrete  X  active  X  reflective due their low occurrences. From with what one would expect if information searching were a learning process. Focusing primarily on groups with nine or more participants (Concrete, Reflective, Active, and Abstract), we see that Abstract learners exhibited the most unique pages viewed. The implications are that in studies of searching systems, those users with Abstract learning styles probably should be control variables. 6. Discussion and implications
In this research, we conducted a laboratory study to investigate whether learning theory provides a basis for investigating lying learning need.

Utilizing Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy of the cognitive domain as the overall learning paradigm, we designed searching scenarios consistent with each classification of the six-levels of the taxonomy. We employed two searching sce-narios for each classification, used a large number of participants, and logged their searching actions. We then measured appropriate model through which to view searching. All hypotheses were partially support using these designated searching characteristics.

Primarily, the middle classification of applying was generally statistically different than remembering and sometimes understanding (i.e., number of queries, number of topics, session duration, number of result pages viewed, and number of nitive tasks of evaluating and creating (i.e., number of queries, unique terms, number of topics, number of result pages viewed, and number of systems used).

In examining the overall relationship between learning level in the cognitive domain and exhibited searching difficulty (i.e., lengthier, longer, higher, etc.) of the task, we get an inverted curve as shown in Fig. 7 .
 ingly, they seem to engage in the same activities at the higher level, presumably just to verify facts and information they pend more on the users X  creativity and viewpoints. The additional knowledge that searchers need to complete the task ap-pear to be fact-finding tasks. Obviously, in these cases, searchers may be missing serendipitous findings and alternative viewpoints. This aspect would be a case for developing searching interfaces to facilitate exploratory searching. However, complex searching needs.

Interestingly, these factors appear to be consistent across users with different learning styles, although there are some statistically significant differences in exhibited search behaviors. These differences are especially notable with Abstract ited differences in searching characteristics, with the exception of Abstract learners.

Naturally, there are limitations with a controlled laboratory study; namely the lack of realism that is present in natu-ralistic studies. However, we believe that the methodology is consistent with our research aims of isolating to the degree possible the learning aspect that appear inherent in information searching tasks. Another limitation is, of course, the searching scenarios. Although we designed the scenarios to be consistent with each level of cognitive learning, there is with a variety of searching scenarios would be beneficial. However, given the study design, it appears that some unique search, it seems reasonable that other cognitive, affective, and situational factors also influence the expression of the underlying information needs. A wide range of information science, computer science, and other domain literature well documents these factors. For example, Oliver and Oliver (1997) have commented that the amount of retained knowledge gained is influenced by the activity context and purpose. We also acknowledge that learning and decision making may be inter-related processes or embedded with each other, as noted by (Tang, 2002 ). Learning and problem solving activities may also be intertwined in the performance of a Web searching activity. Further research is necessary to tease apart these multiple and intertwined factors. Finally, there is the issue of gender imbalance (i.e., were more male than female partic-gender differences within information searching. However, Hupfer and Detlor (2006) in their comprehensive study re-ported no such difference.
 learning taxonomy, which anchors the study within both the learning and searching domains. Second, the use of a controlled laboratory study to examine the relationship of individual variables highlighted the effect of the searching scenarios on exhibited searching characteristics. Third, we examined multiple searching characteristics for differences among the learn-ing categories, which allowed for multiple dimensional examination of searching as learning.
 that Web searchers have simple information needs may not be correct. Some of these simple expressions may be indicative finding.

Second, learning theory may be a way of modeling online searching in a predictive manner. There are many paradigms for information searching (Dervin, 1992; Kuhlthau, 1993; Saracevic, 1996; Wang et al., 2000 ), many studies on information ever, linking these three areas of study in a meaningful way has been lacking. Formulation of need is an important and usu-of information retrieval systems, emphasis should be directed from query construction to analyzing search tasks, informa-these needs, tasks, and problems within the learning framework of Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy appears to be appropriate .

Finally, there are benefits of modeling searching as a cognitive learning process, namely that Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  taxonomy also presents a second dimension concerning the information needed (the Knowledge Dimension), as shown in Table 7 (Forehand, 2005 ).

Anderson and Krathwohl X  X  Taxonomy has a knowledge dimension that, when combined with the cognitive process dimension, results in a 24-cell matrix where one can link cognitive process to the type of knowledge required. These infor-mation needs follow nicely with information needs as noted in various information science and information retrieval liter-need and content by viewing information searching as a learning process.

The implications of this linkage between the cognitive processes, searching characteristics, and desired content are extre-for the development of information searching systems. Marchionini (2006) speaks of building supporting information tools if study, it appears that classifying information searching episodes by levels of the cognitive domain can possibly provide to a real linkage between users, system features, and content. 7. Conclusion and future research their arguments during the search process. Similarly, we could present people with multiple perspectives on an argument search interfaces assuming various modes that correspond to searcher goals and intentions.

Although this research provides a solid basis, it is clear that more work is needed to highlight the relationship between reasons in terms of learning needs. The results from this research suggest one can categorize such searching intentions and searching characteristics that actually link to some cognitive process such as applying or creating .
