 Integrated Document and Content Management: Strategies for Exploiting Enterprise Knowledge. By Len Asprey and Michael Middleton. Idea Group Publishing, Hershey, PA, 2003. xxiv + 526 pp., hardback $80, digital $60, ISBN 1-591-40055-4
Our graduate interdisciplinary program, Information Architecture and Knowledge Management (IAKM) at Kent State University (KSU), was founded two years ago through the work of a number of departments and schools: Communication Studies, Computer Science, Graduate School of Management, Journalism &amp; Mass Communication, Library and Information Science, and Visual Communication Design. The rich mosaic of experience and knowledge represented by this interdisciplinary program is a perfect set-ting for teaching Organizational Memory Management (OMM). I chose an easy to read, thorough, and comprehensive text to convey the learning outcomes for this course. That book is Integrated Document and Content Management: Strategies for Exploiting Enterprise Knowledge .

Many of our KSU-IAKM learners are mid-career professionals, managers, and executives who seek a blueprint and framework for constructing and sustaining new approaches to Knowledge Management (KM). Len and Michael have provided a rich foundation in the pragmatics of OMM and have developed a method of conveying practical information and knowledge about the dynamic and evolving corporate memory environments represented by institutions, businesses, and governments.

The book is both topical and rich in a field where very few useful monographs have been published. The book should be used as a foundational text in Information Science, Information Systems, Knowledge Man-agement, and MIS fields because of its valuable coverage of concepts, guiding principles, methods, and tools. This monograph is ideally suited as a handbook to design a new course that helps the learner pro-totype a successful and innovative IDCM system in an organization. As a fellow author, I can appreciate both the effort and quality that must have been expended to produce this book.

Len and Michael simultaneously cover both the broad and significantly deeper aspects of IDCMs. They begin by establishing a business planning framework as a context for architectural design; highlighting anti-cipated institutional outcomes; describing cultural, behavioral, and change management issues; and outlin-ing infrastructural interface challenges. Subsequently, they depict leadership and executive sponsorship concerns; illustrate life-cycle management processes; summarize the trials involved in project planning, migration, and conversion activities; and explain the difficulties involved with the pursuit of team collabo-ration. They have furnished very useful and easily understandable diagrams, figures, and tables throughout the text.

The book is segmented into 5 parts, where each part methodically and systematically covers the details of sub-topics that will be important to the roles of a Business Champion, Project Manager, and Business Analyst:  X  Part 1: The Business Context  X  X ncluding: business planning frameworks; characteristics of enterprise document environments and IDCM systems; business systems interfaces; and IDCM opportunities;  X  Part 2: Preliminaries  X  X ncluding: project life-cycle planning and methodologies; a policy framework; ele-ments of a feasibility study; and the components of the business case;  X  Part 3: Requirements Analysis And Definition  X  X ncluding: a requirements analysis and definition frame- X  Part 4: Package Selection And Implementation Strategies  X  X ncluding: package selection and implemen- X  Part 5: Appendices  X  X ncluding: a glossary and detailed bibliography; informative websites; IDCM soft-they do capitalize on international and national standards that are intrinsic to the field of OMM (or IDCM as they refer to it). Their approach is fresh and grounded in the practical problems of IDCM project work.
This book fulfils the needs displayed by many highly motivated corporate learners as well as new graduate students who wish to comprehend and learn to apply the foundational elements required to construct and launch a corporate IDCM.
 are focused on the requirements management problems, issues, concerns, and obstacles that can impede organizational success if not properly addressed. All the checklists are instantly useful for the creation of a matrix of user and functional requirements for a project.
 copy of this first edition. It is well written, appropriately outlined, sequenced, and framed, and an easily digestible codification of years of experience and teaching. The suggestions I would make are more relevant to the release of a 2nd edition. Well-described case studies with specific best practices or lessons learned in an appendix or at the end of a chapter would add significant value to the context. This would help the lear-ner to understand the direct application of the topic covered in each chapter.
 would enrich the learners  X  educational experience by enabling the instructor to concentrate on teaching by example. Even if the documents had to be made anonymous for the purpose of maintaining confiden-tiality, the value to the learner would be the insight provided by a written sample of the subject under dis-cussion. Moreover, the use of screen shots from actual IDCM products could also help focus the learner on the actual instantiation of the sub-topics and the user requirements being discussed.
 practice the knowledge they had hopefully acquired during the study of a chapter. I would specifically sug-gest an individual project where the learner is challenged to execute a consulting study that recommends options from three software applications that he/she should consider for personal use on a laptop or work-stations. I used this approach in my class and found the learners quickly and accurately applied the com-prehensive information contained in the chapters and checklists.
 dent could then be instructed through numerous activities and steps to identify other Personal Knowledge
Management Systems (or single-user Document Management applications) that may be downloaded as trial applications and reviewed for functionality. The result would be to instill in learners a much richer appreciation for the use of an IDCM, even something as basic as the ubiquitous MS-Windows Explorer.
Management Educational Framework (KMEF) because it contains rich material with which I can effec-tively teach KM, and specifically OMM. Based upon the experience of learners in my course, I can highly recommend this book to instructors and academics, as well as practitioners. Adaptive Information: Improving Business through Semantic Interoperability, Grid Computing, and Enterprise Integration. By Jeffrey T. Pollock, Ralph Hodgson. Wiley Series in Systems Engineering Management, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2004. $75, ISBN 0-471-48854-2
The business environment is so dynamic that managers are always trying to catch up with the changing world in which they operate, which prompts enterprises to adapt themselves efficiently in order to stay ahead of their competitors. To achieve this, managers have to understand the facts lying behind the change to support better decisions. Unfortunately, that is not easy, not only because it is difficult to find out the true reality behind the phenomenon, but also because it is not easy to communicate the interpretations be-tween each other.

Business successes inevitably require collaboration, especially in the information age where information technology (IT) is indispensable for all business. However, there exist a communication problem between business strategists and the IT team, as they may have different vocabularies and languages. In most cases, even when they are probably talking about the same concept, or at most with a little deviation, they mis-understand each other.

This book is about how to develop a new dynamic and adaptive information infrastructure to learn new behaviors, find patterns, rebuild organizations for different platforms, transform data on the fly and estab-lish new communications without programming, and follow process rules without knowing about specific services in advance. The authors attempt to achieve the aim by using semantic interoperability technologies, which is the key concept of this book.

As described in (Miller, 2000):  X  X  To be interoperable , one should actively be engaged in the ongoing process of ensuring that the systems , procedures and culture of an organization are managed in such a way as to max-imize opportunities for exchange and re-use of information , whether internally or externally.  X  X 
In this book, Pollock and Hodgson define semantic interoperability as  X  X  a dynamic enterprise capability meanings of digital content without human involvement X  X hich in turn drives adaptive business processes , enter-prise knowledge , business rules , and enterprise application interoperability.  X  X  (Pollock and Hodgson, p. 6).
The authors claim that business benefits can be achieved through the use of technologies that support semantic interoperability. They can:  X  increase profits by faster response to market demands, better decision making, and cheaper adoption of new strategies.
