 One consequence of the expressive richness of natural langu ages is that usually more than one means exists of expressing the same (or approximately the same) me ssage. As a result, speakers are often confronted with choices as to how to structure their intende d message into an utterance. At the same time, linguistic communication takes place under a host of c ognitive and environmental constraints: speakers and addressees have limited cognitive resources t o bring to bear, speaker and addressee have incomplete knowledge of the world and of each other X  X  st ate of knowledge, the environment of communication is noisy, and so forth. Under these circumsta nces, if speakers are rational then we can expect them to attempt to optimize the communicative pro perties of their utterances. But what are the communicative properties that speakers cho ose to optimize? The prevalence of ambiguity in natural language X  X he fact that many structura l analyses are typically available for a given utterance X  X ight lead one to expect that speakers seek to minimize structural ambiguity, but both experimental (Arnold et al., 2004, inter alia) and corp us-based (Roland et al., 2006, inter alia) investigations have found little evidence for active use of ambiguity-avoidance strategies. In this paper we argue for a different locus of optimization: that sp eakers structure utterances so as to opti-mize information density . Here we use the term  X  X nformation X  in its most basic informa tion-theoretic sense X  X he negative log-probability of an event X  X nd by  X  X nf ormation density X  we mean the amount of information per unit comprising the utterance. If speake rs behave optimally, they should structure their utterances so as to avoid peaks and troughs in informat ion density (see also (Aylett and Turk, 2004; Genzel and Charniak, 2002)). For example, this princi ple of uniform information density (UID) as an aspect of rational language production predicts that speakers should modulate phonetic duration in accordance with the predictability of the unit e xpressed. This has been shown by Bell et al. (2003, inter alia) for words and by Aylett and Turk (200 4) for syllables. If UID is a general principle of communicative optimality, however, its effec ts should be apparent at higher levels of linguistic production as well. In line with this prediction are the results of Genzel and Charniak (2002); Keller (2004), who found that sentences taken out of context have more information the later they occur in a discourse. For phonetic reduction, cho ices about word duration can directly modulate information density. However, it is less clear how the effects of UID at higher levels of language production observed by Genzel and Charniak (2002) and Keller (2004) come about. Gen-zel and Charniak (2002) show that at least part of their resul t is driven by the repetition of open-class words, but it is unclear how this effect relates to a broader r ange of choice points within language production. In particular, it is unclear whether any choice s above the lexical level are affected by information density (as expected if UID is general). In this paper we present the first evidence that speakers X  choice during syntactic planning is affected by i nformation density optimization. This evidence comes from syntactic reduction  X  X  phenomenon in which speakers have the choice of ei-ther marking a phrase with an optional word, or leaving it unm arked (Section 3). We show that in cases where the phrase is marked, the marking reduces the phr ase X  X  information density, and that the phrases that get marked are the ones that would otherwise be t he most information-dense (Section 4). This provides crucial support for UID as a general princi ple of language production. The possibility that speakers X  use of syntactic reduction o ptimizes information density leads to ques-tions as to how speakers estimate the probability of an upcom ing syntactic event. In particular, one can ask what types of cues language users employ when estimat ing these probabilites. For example, speakers could compute information density using only surf ace cues (such as the words immediately preceding a phrase). On the other hand, they might also take s tructural features of the utterance into account. We investigate these issues in Section 5 using an in cremental model of structured utterance production. In this model, the predictability of the upcoming phrase markable by the optional word is taken as a measure of the phrase X  X  information density. Th e resulting predictability estimate, in turn, becomes a covariate in a separate model of syntactic re duction. Through this two-step mod-eling approach we show that predictability is able to explai n a significant part of the variability in syntactic reduction, and that evidence exists for speakers using both structural and surface cues in estimating phrasal predictability. We begin with the information-theoretic definition that the information conveyed by a complete ut-terance u is u  X  X  Shannon information content (also called its surprisal ), or log utterance u is realized in n units (for example, words w sum of the information conveyed by each unit of u : For simplicity we assume that each w space (written language). Optimization of information den sity entails that the information conveyed by each w in which UID may be optimal. First, the transmission of a mess age via spoken or written language optimized near the channel capacity, where speakers maximi ze the rate of information transmission while minimizing the danger of a mistransmitted message (se e also Aylett (2000); Aylett and Turk (2004); Genzel and Charniak (2002)). That is, UID is an optim al solution to the problem of rapid yet error-free communication in a noisy environment.
 Second and independently of whether linguistic communicat ion is viewed as a noisy channel, UID can be seen as minimizing comprehension difficulty. The diffi culty incurred by a comprehen-der in processing a word w ( problem of low-effort comprehension . UID would be optimal in several ways, but do speakers actuall y consider UID as a factor when making choices during online syntactic production? We addr ess this question by directly linking a syntactic choice point to UID. If information density optim ization is general, i.e. if it applies to all aspects of language production, we should find its effects ev en in structural choices. We use variation in the form of certain types of English relat ive clauses (henceforth RCs) to test this hypothesis. At the onset of an RC speakers can, but do not have to, utter the relativizer that . 2 We refer to the omission of that as syntactic REDUCTION . (1) How big is [ NP the family i [ RC ( that ) you cook for i ]]? Our dataset consists of a set of 3,452 RCs compatible with the above variation, extracted from the Switchboard corpus of spontaneous American English spe ech. All RCs were automatically annotated for a variety of control factors that are known to i nfluence syntactic reduction of RCs, including RC size, distance of the RC from the noun it modifies , data about the speaker including gender and speech rate, local measures of speech disfluency, and formal and animacy properties of the RC subject (a full list is given in the appendix; see also ( Jaeger, 2006)). These control factors are used in the logistic regression models presented in Sect ion 5. From a syntactic perspective, the choice to omit a relativiz er means that the first word of an RC conveys two pieces of information simultaneously: the onse t of a relative clause and part of its internal contents (usually part of its subject, as you in Example (1)). Using the notation w the context preceding the RC and w two pieces of information can be expressed as a Markov decomp osition of w Conversely, the choice to use a relativizer separates out th ese two pieces of information, so that the only information carried by w If the overall distribution of syntactic reduction is in acc ordance with principles of information-density optimization, we should expect that full forms (ove rt relativizers) should be used more often when the information density of the RC would be high if the relativizer were omitted. The infor-mation density of the RC and subsequent parts of the sentence can be quantified by their Shannon information content. As a first test of this prediction, we us e n -gram language models to measure the relationship between the Shannon information content of th e first word of an RC and the tendency toward syntactic reduction.
 We examined the relationship between rate of syntactic redu ction and the surprisal that w have if no relativizer had been used X  X hat is, log 1 Figure 1: RC n -gram-estimated information density and syntactic reduct ion. Dotted green line indicates lowess fit. P ( w 1 | w  X  X  X  X  1 ) may be low precisely because that is normally inserted between w  X  X  X  X  1 and w 1 ), we estimated P ( w were omitted. That is, if we compare actual English with a hyp othetical pseudo-English differing only in the absence of optional relativizers, are the overt r elativizers in actual English distributed in a way such that they occur more in the contexts that would be of highest information density in the the trigram probability P ( w if no relativizer had been used , regardless of whether a relativizer was actually used or no t. We then examined the relationship between this probability an d the outcome event: whether or not a relativizer was actually used. Figure 4 shows the relations hip between the different quantiles of the log-probability of w common when the probability P ( w Section 4 provides evidence that speakers X  choices about sy ntactic reduction are correlated with information density: RC onsets that would be more informati onally dense in reduced form are less likely to be reduced. This observation does not, however, pr ovide strong evidence that speakers are directly sensitive to information density in their choices about reduction. Furthermore, if speakers are sensitive to information density in their reduction choice s, it raises a new question: what kind of information is taken into account in speakers X  estimation o f information density? This section addresses the questions of whether reduction i s directly sensitive to information density, and what information might be used in estimates of informati on density, using a two-step modeling approach. The first step involves a incremental stochastic m odel of structured utterance production. This model is used to construct estimates of the first term in E quation (2) contributing to an RC onset X  X  information density: the predictability (conditional probability) of an RC beginning at a Figure 2: A flattened-tree representation of a sentence cont aining an RC. The incremental parse through world consists of everything to the left of the dashed line. given point in a sentence, given an incremental structural r epresentation for the sentence up to that point. Because the target event space of this term is small, a wide variety of cues, or features, can be included in the model, and the reliability of the resultin g predictability estimates is relatively high. This model is described in Section 5.1. The resulting p redictability estimates serve as a crucial covariate in the second step: a logistic regression model in cluding a number of control factors (see Section 3 and appendix). This model is used in Sections 5.3 as a stringent test of the explanatory power of UID for speakers X  reduction choices, and in Section 5.4 to determine whether evidence exists for speakers using structural as well as surface cues in their predictability estimates. 5.1 A structural predictability model In this section we present a method of estimating the predict ability of a relative clause in its sen-tential context, contingent on the structural analysis of t hat context. For simplicity, we assume that structural analyses are context-free trees, and that the co mplete, correct incremental analysis of the that is, the probability that a phrase of type RC appears in th e utterance beginning at w the incremental structured utterance h w duction as a fully incremental, top-down stochastic tree ge neration process similar to that used for parsing in Roark (2001). Tree production begins by expandin g the root node, and the expansion process for each non-terminal node N consists of the following steps: Steps (b) and (c) are repeated until a special right-sister e vent  X  EN D  X  is chosen in step (c), at which point expansion of N is complete. As in Collins (2003) and Roark (2001), this type of directed generative process allows conditioning on arbitr ary features of the incremental utterance. After each word w active node N Figure 2 gives an example of an incremental utterance just be fore an RC, and illustrates how Equa-tion (5) might be applied. 8 At this point, NN would be the active node, and step (b) of expa nding NP (3) would have just been completed. An RC beginning after w ceivably modify any of the NPs marked (1)-(3), and all three o f those attachments may contribute probability mass to P ( RC make no further expansion. 5.2 Model parameters and estimation What remains is to define the relevant event space and estimat e the parameters of the tree-generation model. For RC predictability estimation, the only relevant category distinctions are between RC,  X  EN D  X  , and any other non-null category, so we limit our event space to these three outcomes. Furthermore, because RCs are never leftmost daughters, we c an ignore the parameters determining first-daughter event outcome probabilities (step (a) in Sec tion 5.1). We estimate event probabilities We included five classes of features in our models, chosen by l inguistic considerations of what is likely to help predict the next event given an active node in a n incremental utterance (see Wasow et al. (ress)): The complete set of features used is listed in a supplementar y appendix. 5.3 Explanatory power of phrasal predictability the information-density hypothesis to a more stringent tes t. We evaluate the explanatory power of phrasal predictability in logistic regression models of sy ntactic reduction that include all the control variables otherwise known to influence relativizer omissio n (Section 3). To avoid confounds due to clusters of data points from the same speaker, the model was b ootstrapped ( 10 , 000 iterations) with set listed in Section 5.2) was entered into this model as a cov ariate to test whether RC predictability co-determines syntactic reduction after other factors are controlled for. Phrasal predictability makes demonstrates that phrasal predictability has explanatory power in this case of syntactic reduction. 5.4 Surface and structural conditioning of phrasal predict ability The structural predictability model puts us in a position to ask whether empirically observed patterns of syntactic reduction give evidence for speakers X  use of so me types of cues but not others. In particular, there is a question of whether predictability b ased on surface cues alone (the NGRAM features of Section 5.2) provides a complete description of information-density effects on speakers X  choices in syntactic reduction. We tested this by building a syntactic-reduction model containing two predictability covariates: one using NGRAM features alone, and one using all other (i.e., structural, o r all-but-NGRAM ) feature types listed in Section 5.2. We can then test whethe r the parameter weight in the reduction model for each predictability measure differ s significantly from zero. It turns out that both predictability measures matter: all-but-NGRAM predictability is highly significant (  X  2 (1) = While NGRAM and all-but-NGRAM probabilities are strongly correlated ( r 2 = 0 . 70 ), they evidently exhibit enough differences to contribute non-redundant in formation in the reduction model. We interpret this as evidence that speakers may be using both su rface and structural cues for phrasal predictability estimation in utterance structuring. Using a case study in syntactic reduction, we have argued tha t information-density optimization X  the tendency to maximize the uniformity of upcoming-event p robabilities at each part of a sentence X  X lays an important role in speakers X  choices abou t structuring their utterances. This ques-tion has been previously addressed in the context of phoneti c reduction of highly predictable words and syllables (Aylett and Turk, 2004; Bell et al., 2003), but not in the case of word reduction. Using a stochastic tree-based model of incremental utterance prod uction combined with a logistic regression model of syntactic reduction, we have found evidence that wh en speakers have the choice between using or omitting an optional function word that marks the on set of a phrase, they use the func-tion word more often when the phrase it introduces is less pre dictable. We have found evidence that speakers may be using both phrasal and structural infor mation to calculate upcoming-event predictabilities. The overall distribution of syntactic r eduction has the effect of smoothing the in-formation profile of the sentence: when the function word is n ot omitted, the information density of the immediately following words is reduced. The fact that our case study involves the omission of a single word with little to no impact on utterance meaning made the data particularly amenable to analysis, but we believe that this method is potentially a pplicable to a wider range of variable linguistic phenomena, such as word ordering and lexical cho ice.
 More generally, we believe that the ensuing view of constrai nts on situated linguistic communication as limits on the information-transmission capacity of the e nvironment, or on information-processing capacity of human language processing faculties, can serve as a useful framework for the study of language use. On this view, syntactic reduction is availabl e to the speaker as a pressure valve to reg-ulate information density when it is dangerously high. Equi valently, the presence of a function word can be interpreted as a signal to the comprehender to expect t he unexpected, a rational exchange of time for reduced information density, or a meaningful del ay (Jaeger, 2005). More generally, reduction at different levels of linguistic form (phonetic detail, detail of referring expressions, as well as omission of words, as in the case examined here) provi des a means for speakers to smooth the information-density profile of their utterances (Aylet t and Turk, 2004; Genzel and Charniak, 2002). This raises important questions about the specific mo tivations of speakers X  choices: are these choices made for the sake of facilitating production, or as p art of audience design? Finally, this view emphasizes the connection between grammatical optionalit y and communicative optimality. The availability of more than one way to express a given meaning g rants speakers the choice to select the optimal alternative for each communicative act.
