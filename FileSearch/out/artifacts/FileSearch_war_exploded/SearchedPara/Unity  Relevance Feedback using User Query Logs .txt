 Search, one finds a discrepancy. The first five refinements are: monty python, ball python, colt python, burmese python, python snake. A possible reason for this discrepancy is that web page creators are more tech savvy (in terms of linking documents, creating content) than average users. Thus, the links that are created online may not be the best measure for disambiguation of an ambiguous query. In addition to the above, there are queries like Britney Spears , which is often an in-news query, and queries like Turkey, which can be a seasonal/temporal query. These issues of ambiguity, variety, freshness and temporality are well known in the IR community but are not fully addressed by major web search engines. In this paper, we propose a solution to address these issues in a generic way using user query logs. The central idea is to use search refinements as a source for establishing a global truth (sense) for a given query and tune our search results in various ways including query expansion, interleaving results, and re-ranking of results. We generate search refinements using a technology called Units (See also: [1]). Units are defined as the atomic constituents or  X  X oncepts X  in user queries. They are generated from the search query logs through an automated statistical approach. User queries are made up of one or more words. Some examples are hawaii , new york city , and new york city law enforcement . We believe that human beings do not naturally think in terms of queries but rather in terms of natural concepts . Hence, hawaii and new york city are different queries as measured by number of words but they are both made up of one concept each. new york city law enforcement is different from them as it is made up of two distinct concepts new york city and law enforcement . Units are generated using an iterative statistical approach using canonicalized query logs. The Unit generation algorithm takes as its input a consolidated query file, which has distinct queries and their frequencies over a specific time interval. In the first iteration, all single words in all queries are considered as units or concepts and their frequencies are stored. In subsequent iterations, every query is tokenized into the existing set of units. Co-occurring units are merged to form possible units and are stored to record their total co-occurrence frequencies over the entire query file. At the end of the iteration, possible units are validated to determine if they are actual units (based on mutual information and other statistical measures). One of the important applications of Units is the generation of query refinements. Query refinements are determined from what are called extensions and associations . An extension of a unit is a larger unit that contains all the words in the first unit. An association of a unit is another unit with which the first unit appears often in queries. We applied the Units and refinements generation processes on Yahoo! Search query logs. The resulting refinements have been tested and the suggestions are used as one of the inputs in the Also try feature assumed that clicks based on the title and abstract shown on search results page would indicate that the users found the suggested results relevant. This test was conducted using a benchmark of 10000 queries selected randomly from a subset of queries which were frequently refined by users. The top 20 results for each query were then generated using the Implicit re-ranking algorithm . The re-ranking was done such that there was rarely a change in the top 5 results for every query. The test was conducted for a week where a bucket of 2% of Yahoo! Search users was targeted with our results and there was a control bucket of 2% users who were shown the original search results. The users in both buckets were chosen randomly. We were interested in finding out the click distribution for the top 20 ranks coming from each of the buckets. Figure 1 shows the improvement in percentage clicks received by Unity as compared to default Yahoo! Search results at various ranks from 1-20. The results show a very positive indication about the relevance of Unity results. The graph shows significant improvements with Unity results below rank 5 after which most of Unity X  X  re-ranking came into play. It should be noted that we get this improvement even after introducing the results beyond the first five results, which tend to get most of the user attention. Users had to scroll or go to the next page (if their number of results on first page is set to 10) to see the newly introduced results. We plan to conduct more tests with introduction of more Unity results starting higher up than rank 5. We would also like to integrate the system more closely with the search engine and evaluate the impact. The paper described a novel method for relevance feedback using user query logs. The proposed algorithms make use of refinement queries as an indication of concepts closely related to the given query X  X  original concept. We make use of a technology called Units for generation of query refinements. Our tests show promising improvement over Yahoo! Search X  X  original results in terms of click ratios. As mentioned in the previous section, we plan to conduct further aggressive tests starting the re-ranking from ranks higher than 5 including 1 st and 2 nd ranks. We would also like to evaluate the other two strategies, namely, Implicit/Explicit interleaving and Click based replacement further. It should be noted that the proposed techniques can be applied in the area of any vertical search products like news, blogs, shopping, images, video, etc. We can make use of query refinements from the vertical or web search or a merge of both for this purpose. Similarly, instead of considering refinements generated from weekly logs, we can consider refinements generated per day or even per hour to identify any change in user interests as early as possible. Towards an end goal, we would like to investigate how we can pursue personalization of search results using user specific search query refinements. [1] Pavlov, D., Balasubramanyan, et al .
