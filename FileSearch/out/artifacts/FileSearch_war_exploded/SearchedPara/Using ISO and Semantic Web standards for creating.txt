 In spite of the progress reached in the field of Medical Informatics, it is still difficult for Health care professionals and other health actors to reg-ister and codify clinical data in daily practice . The link between Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and international English classification systems used to codify the clinical data is often complex, not well integrated and hampered by a translation gap, both in terms of language and of world of reference (patient, general practitioner, medical speciali st, etc.). the goal of semantic interoperability entails con-struction of interface terminologies, defined by (Rosenbloom et al., 2006) as a  X  X  systematic co l-lection of healthcare-related phrases (terms) to supp ort clinicians X  entries of patient -related in-formation into computer programs such as clin i-cal  X  X ote capture X  and decision support tools, facilitating display of computer-stored patient information to clinician users as simple human-readable texts X  X . These kinds of interface term i-nologies can be used for problem list entry, clin i-cal documentation in EHRs, text generation and care provider ord er entry with decision support. The question is whether existing interface term i-nologies are sophisticated enough to support s e-mantic interoperable c om munication of the clinical data between partners in a multilingual health care system. Until now, interface term i-nologies have been either limited to one lan-guage (often English), or either providing an interface to only one nomenclature (e.g. SNOMED) or classification (e.g. International Classification of Diseases). tectural structure for a multilingual medical in-terface terminology, following both lexical and terminological ISO standards on multilingual terminologies and using Semantic Web techno l-ogies and languages (RDF/OWL, SPARQL, Linked Data, etc.). The ambition of this multilin-gual resource for general practitioners, patients, medical professionals, and allied health person-nel is to span the gap between human language (as addressed in Natural Language Processing systems) and machine language (used to manage concepts and their lexical representations) and to map to a variety of well-respected international medical nomenclatures, thesauri and classific a-tion systems). gives an overview of the state of the art in the field of Medical Terminology. Section 3 d e-scribes the approach to building the structure for a hybrid interface terminology. Section 4 is d e-voted to present a use case on Heart Failure and preliminary results. Finally, Section 5 provides some discussion and conclusions. Over the last two decades, research on medical terminologies and classification systems has b e-come a popular topic and much work has been done to map between several nomenclatures ent in structure and purposes and used by phys i-cians during their patient s X  health care visits. on the extensive use of UMLS as a knowledge resource for extracting semantic mappings ( see Fung and Bodenreider, 2005). ogies in the biomedical domain has lead ed to promising results in terms of information int e-gration across heterogeneous resources. Exa m-ples are the use of Resource Development Framework (RDF), triple stores and SPARQL queries in integrating consumer-oriented term i-nologies with standard classification systems in UMLS (Cardillo et al., 2012), or for aligning standardized nomenclatures with thesauri (Bodenreider, 2008). Many tools have been cr e-ated for automatic alignment between resources. more useful to ontology alignment. Results of these kind of alignment algorithms are recorded in healthcare is the formalization of existing medical terminologies or classification systems in ontologies. SNOMED-CT (Rector and Brandt, 2008) and the upcoming ICD-11 (Tudorache et al., 2010) represent a good example of this pra c-tice. Important is also the creation of medical on-tology repositories, such as Bioportal 10 , a We b-based open repository where users can search and browse biomedical ontologies as well as cr e-ate mappings for them. useful, above all if integrated in EHRs or in Pe r-sonal Health Records (PHRs), since they give structuring and semantics to the recorded info r-mation. With predefined mappings of vocabula r-ies used in the original data, they also allow for aggregation, reuse of knowledge, automated re a-soning on data, search and retrieval of data from diverse original source systems. launched for the creation of consumer-oriented terminologies or classification systems. Exa m-ples of this challenge are: the Open Access Co l-laborative Consumer Health Vocabulary for English, developed by (Zeng et al., 2006) and available in the UMLS Metathesaurus; the Italian Consumer Medical Vocabulary (ICMV), deve l-oped by (Cardillo, 2011) using a lexi-ontological approach, and the Multilingual Glossary of Popular and Technical Medical Terms, in nine of the European Commission. of application in the domain of medical term i-nology of two ISO terminological standards, namely Lexical Markup Framework (LMF, ISO 24613, 2008) and Te rminological Markup Framework (TMF, ISO 16642, 2003), the ab-sence of a multilingual approach. We propose a Medical Interface Terminology, that is composed of two types of domain-specific resources: a multilingual reference terminology (linked to international classifications, thesauri and nomenclatures), on the one hand, and unilin-gual end-user lexicons the other hand. nology to be used in the primary domain for in-formation storage, encoding, translation, and retrieval, we used a hybrid approach that consists in the combination between onomasiological and semasiological approaches. On one hand we build the structure of the reference terminolo gy starting from essential concepts of the domain and then look for their lexical representations in different international classificatio ns. On the other hand, we build also the structure of an end-user lexicon following the opposite approach, so starting with a word (or phrase) and looking for its different meanings, and in particular to which concept in the onomasiological resource the wo rd refers to. As mentioned in Section 1., to build this interface terminology we advocate our choice for standard frameworks, using the ISO norms on Terminological Markup Framework (TMF) and on Lexical Markup Framework (LMF), whose meta-models perfectly fit with our requirements. For each type of resource of the interface terminology, we explain our approach to apply the mentioned standards, and to build the two recourses with data categories and do-data category registry (ISO 12620, 1999). Fina l-ly, we describe the approach for publishing these resources as Linked Open Data (LOD). 3.1. Creating a TMF based Reference A reference terminology comprehensively and rigorously defines reference concepts and ex-pressions within the biomedical domain, includ-ing interrelations between concepts (Rosenbloom et al., 2006), and provides a common reference point for comparisons and aggregation of data about the entire health care process, recorded by multiple different individuals, systems or institu-tions. It allows the concepts to be defined in a formal and computer-processable way and to be mapped to existing standard nomenclatures and classification systems. This allows to support consistent and understandable coding of clinical concepts and so is a central feature for use in EHRs. lingual reference terminology, following the standard TMF (Romary et al., 2006), conceived to structurally address multi lingualism. Th e TMF meta-model, which keeps the traditional onomasiological view of a terminological entry, decomposes the organization of a terminological database into five basic components: i) the te r-minological resource (Terminological Data Co l-lection); ii) the concept (Terminological Entry) ; iii) the language chosen (Language Selection) ; iv) the term(s) in the language chosen (Term En-try); v) components of the term (Term Comp o-nent Section). internationally accepted data categories, relevant to the functionalities of the reference terminolo-gy (e.g., entrySource , languageIdentifier , preferredTerm ) that have been selected from the already mentioned ISOcat.org platform. Detailed explanations on the TMF meta-model and on the selected data categories can be found in (Roumier et al., 2011). Markup Language (TML) that comprises the mappings between the Meta-model, the data cat-egories and their domain values. The resulting TML has been serialized using the XML schema we were inspired by the TML created in the cepts to a respectable minimum (between 7.000 and 15.000 concepts). For each concept, the level of granularity is assessed. Pre-coordinated con-cepts are kept to a minimum (based on frequen-cy-of-use criteria). el (language independent), selected concepts are incorporated in the TMF resource. To each con-cept a definition in English is assigned and i f possible, a perfect match for that concept is looked for in the SNOMED-CT nomenclature, or in the UMLS Metathesaurus. Otherwise, the concept is genuinely defined within the system. Each concept in the reference terminology is cat-egorized according to medical categories (sym p-tom, disease, medical procedure, body part, etc.) . In addition, to ensure semantic interoperability, links to international terminologies (SNOMED-CT and UMLS) and classification systems (ICD ICPC-2) are provided, with the corresponding qualitative nature of the mapping (exact match, nearly exact, match to higher or lower level of granularity, match not possible). guage dependent) the concept is labeled with one preferred term (the most suitable clinical term used by physicians to coin the concept in this language) and one admitted term (the most suit a-ble lay term used by consumers and patients to coin the concept in that language) for each pa r-ticipating language. In case the concept has a SNOMED-CT exact match, a  X  X tandardized term X  is also given (literal translation of the fully specified SNOMED-CT name). hierarchical (broader-narrower) links or links between related concept into our system, nor any other attempt to self-generated ontological map-ping. We decided to rely on the mappings to the international nomenclatures and classifications to explore the semantic relations between the con-cepts in our resource, and not to invest energy in the possibly redundant activity of creating a new ontology. 3.2. Creating an LMF based end-user The second type of resource in the interface te r-minology is a series of unilingual end-user lex i-cons that must be linked to the multilingual reference terminology described above. These end-user lexicons (one for each language) can be linked to Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, and can be oriented to patients and to professionals. common standardized framework for NLP lex i-cons. This model deals with linguistic complex i-ties, and, as TMF, uses the ISOc at source for the association of linguistic data categories (e.g., partOfSpeech , namedEntity ). Furthermore it can be linked to TMF and other concept based repr e-sentation systems. Resources in LMF can also be linked to existing lexical NLP resources (such as WordNet). LMF meta-model contains a mech a-nism to deal with multiple senses (Francopoulo et al, 2007 ). words (or phrases) that are selected from everyday interactions between doctors and patients (occurrences in medical records, in guidelines, in web consultations, etc.), based on frequency count and relevance. Various methodologies for human or automated term extraction can be used. For each of the selected words (or phrases), the possible senses (i.e. medical and non-me dical ones ) are clearly defined and entered as such in the LMF end-user lexicon of the originating language. type of resource, the multilingual reference terminology and the end-user unilingual lexicons: In the unilingual end-user lexicons, links to syn-onyms for selected words (or phrases) in the s e-lected sense can be provided. At this level, also subtle differences between related languages (e.g. Portuguese in Portugal and in Brazil, Eng-lish in the UK and in the US, Dutch in the Neth-erlands and in Belgium) are addressed. 3.3. Publication in Linked Open Data The TMF model of the reference terminology, described in Section 3.1, is implemented as an OWL-DL ontology, which is an efficient way of defining the components (represented as hierarchically organized classes) and the vocabulary (consisting of data and object properties that can be easily reused in other data sets) and ensuring the consistency of the data. classes, while data categories are represented as OWL object properties. Classes, whenever possible, are linked to similar concepts in other international recognized classifications, available on the web as Linked Data, using the owl:equivalentClass property (which, in this case, should be preferred to owl:sameAs to avoid undesired effects when using reasoners (Halpin et al., 2010). Because a one-to-one correspondence c annot always be found between all the classifications, in some cases entries can be grouped in more general categories with the owl:unionOf property. OWL/RDF allows for the publication of the data accessible via SPARQL queries. Linked Data principles encourage reuse, reduce redundancy, maximize its real and potential inter-connectedness, and finally enable network effects to add value to data (Bizer et al., 20 09). proposed model for modeling lexicons and m a-chine-readable dictionaries based on LMF and, similarly to our TMF terminology, using Seman-tic Web technologies and ISOcat data categories (McCrae et al., 2012). The functionality to pub-lish the content of the lexicons in Linked Open Data is an established part of the LEMON framework. To populate the structure of our interface terminology with a test sample, we have chosen to extract relevant concepts and words or phrases from a Belgian bilingual (Dutch and French) guideline on Heart Failure for general practitioners, published by the Scientific Associations of Primary Care Physicians (Van Royen et al., 2011). For this study we worked with the French version as a starting point. We describe a manual concept extraction and an automated term extraction, along with the procedures to populate both the TMF and LMF-LEMON resources. 4.1. Concept extraction to the TMF A general practitioner, expert in medical classif i-cations, analyzed the French version of me n-tioned guideline, and after a careful reading and tagging, selected 168 concepts, relevant for the clinical domain of heart failure and pertaining to the reference world of general practice. entered in the TMF resource, at the Term Entry section of the French language section. concept, together with a reference to the French guideline from which the concept was extracted. For each concept, a preferred term (representing the technical term used by physicians) and one or more admitted terms (representing the lay term used by patients for that concept) were chosen . For some technical terms the corresponding lay term was a simple description of the term itself (e.g. the French admitted term  X  eau dans le ventre  X  for the technical term  X  ascite  X ). Entry level was addressed. The corresponding concepts were looked up in ICPC-2, the reference classification for general practice. Then, the cross mapping to ICD10 were sought after. Next a search in the SNOMED-CT web browser was made and finally the relevant corresponding definitions were extracted from the UMLS Metathesaurus, using a dedicated tool. In case a perfect match with a SNOMED-CT concept was possible, its Fully Specified Name was entered (as well as its French literal translation). In case the concept could not be matched in SNOMED-CT, a definition in English was sought (and the event recorded for notification to the international SNOMED-CT governance group IH TS DO ). concepts selected from the guideline, 153 were mapped to ICPC-2, 131 to ICD-10, 161 concepts to SNOMED-CT, and 116 to UMLS definitions. SNOMED-CT were the too broad and general nature of the selected concept, and mismatches between  X  X orld of references X . For instance, in the guideline, the concept  X  X exual problems X  was repeatedly used at this broad level to convey information (and thus necessary in the communication). Some concepts (e.g. drug side effect  X  X ry mouth X ) were not within the scope of SNOMED-CT, as the category  X  X ymptom and complaint X  (very important for primary care) is alien to SNOMED-CT. Both UMLS and SNOMED-CT use semantic types to categorize concepts. However, the conceptual framework of these semantic types is different, which also leads to difficulties in finding an exact conceptual match for locally used medical terms in international nomenclatures. With regard to mapping to ICD-10, we noticed that 15 of the 168 concepts referred to aspects of functional status (e.g. nutritional status, exercise intolerance), which is difficult to represent in ICD. This provoked difficulties to map to this classification (oriented towards morbidity and mortality classification). Similarly, a number of terms related to medical procedures could not be mapped. Regarding ICPC-2, some of the selected concepts were mapped to more than one ICPC-2 rubric (e.g.  X  X lcoholic cardiomyopathy X  mapped to  X  X eart disease other X  (K84) and  X  X hronic alcohol abuse X  (P15)) and in most cases they were mapped to broad rag bag ICPC-2 rubrics as in the case of the concept  X  X aladie de Paget X  mapped to the ICPC-2 rubric  X  T99 -M usculoskeletal other diseases X  . section was populated with a translation of the preferred term and of the admitted term. This was performed with the help of Italian speaking domain experts and a terminologist, sustained by mapping to an existing Italian medical vocabulary oriented to healthcare consumers (the already mentioned ICMV). A similar work is to be made for English and Dutch language sections, and further expanded as described above. 4.2. Term extraction to the LMF resource. The two versions (Dutch/French) of the heart failure guideline (30 pages of text) were submi t-ted to the term extraction program TExSIS (Macken et al., 2013) , which provides tokeniz a-tion, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, d e-tection of phrases, named entity recognition, and bilingual sentence alignment. The term extra c-tion resulted in an aligned bilingual glossary of 774 words and phrases. matching to the French preferred terms of con-cepts in the TMF resource was performed. Su r-prisingly only 77 French preferred terms among 168 had a string match with the 774 word and phrases extracted by TExSIS. These 77 French terms were then entered in the French LMF -LEMON resource and linked to the identification number of the concepts in the TMF resource. the TMF resource, resulting into an increase of entries in the LMF-LEMON resource to 138 lex-ical entries. For 16 admitted terms there was no difference with the French preferred term. Among the 138 lexical entries, 114 were phrases, and were then decomposed into single words, the total of entries to 298 in the LMF-LEMON r e-source. This rapid increase in the number of terms is however unlikely to be linear, since some words are part of several phrases (e.g.  X  insuffisance cardiaque  X   X   X  insuffisance r X nale  X  ). mation, such as part-of-speech tag, lemma, spelling variants and inflected forms. The med i-cal senses of the entries are linked to the refe r-ence terminology, and the other senses to 4.3.

We presented a first attempt, with in a small use case, to create a sophisticated, hybrid medical interface terminolo gy, aiming at multilingual so-lutions, at semantic interoperability, and at open source availability as Linked Open Data in the Semantic Web.

In fact, in order to provide semantic interoperability between different healthcare information systems and between different health actors and patients, multilingual access to international terminologies is needed. tem, relying on ISO standards and Semantic Web languages and tools, published as Linked Open Data supports : (i) the efficient use of existing medical terminologies and their legacy data in the activity of clinical encoding ; (ii) links b e-tween professional language and lay language, and healthcare information system integration (e.g. between EHRs and PHRs) ; (iii) multilin-gualism in its core approach to semantic interop-erability; (iv) information retrieval, and (v) creation of information through epidemiological research. Our interface terminology will enable physicians to find the right medical entry at the right moment at the point of care, and to int e-grate their data with standard classifications for their encoding, being consistent with the r e-quirements of their Health Authority (e.g. the mandatory use in the General Practice of ICPC, or ICD as coding system for diagnoses or prob-lem lists), and finally to exchange their data with other healthcare professionals and within various healthcare information systems in an interoper a-ble way. coverage of our reference terminology selecting other use cases (e.g. contra-indications of med i-cation) and to extend the range of participating languages. based management platform for the extension and maintenance of the proposed Multilingual Medical Interface Terminology.
