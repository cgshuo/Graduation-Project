 Grid technology [1] has recently become an active research field. Resource discovery covery is a sticking point in Grid research field. 
In this paper, we put forward a Grid service discovery framework based on multi-work: service description language (SDL) and service matchmaking mechanism. vices such as resources, information, and particular domain-specific problem-solving capabilities; request-agent requests some specific services; medium-agents provide means to find relevant service-agents for request-agent. Request-agent communicates with corresponding service-agents and decide s whether to subscribe to their services. 
The key of this framework is how to perform the service matchmaking embedded in the medium-agents. The process of service matchmaking mainly involves: z class hierarchy to represent terms used in the descriptions of services, 3.1 Possibilistic Reasoning We propose a representation for uncertain information and an inference mechanism based on possibility and necessity measures [3] proposed by Dubois and Prade.  X  ,( , ) rr rN  X   X , where r denotes a classical proposition, r N denotes the lower bound  X ,( , ) rr rN  X   X  means that the degree of ease to say that r is false is at most equal to  X  and the degree of ease to say that r is true is at most equal to 
A general formulation of inference rule in cluding multiple antecedents is expressed as follows: probabilistic entailment [4] proposed by Nilsson. 3.2 Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPN) nodes, called places and transitions. A typical interpretation of Petri nets is to view could be uncertain. To take uncertain info rmation into account, we define a Fuzzy Petri nets as follows. Definition 1. A Fuzzy Petri net (FPN for short) is defined as a five-tuple: ures to represent the uncertainty about the connectivity. ()() FPT TP  X  X  X  X  X  is a set of arcs. :{1,2,3,} WF  X  L is a weight function. 012 {(), ( ), , ( )} m MMpMp Mp = L with necessity and possibility measures) in i p . possibilistic tokens from its each input place, adds new possibilistic tokens to its each will be computed according to the possibilistic reasoning. 3.3 Using FPN as a Basis for Service Description Language We use Fuzzy Petri net as a basis for servi ce description language to provide a speci-fication to publish, request and match services in Grid environment. A simple exam-ple is illustrated to demonstrate the use of FPN-SDL as follows. Example 1. Suppose that there is a mechanic working in Beijing and specializing in fixing Van . Meanwhile, there is a man whose truck is broken in Tianjin and requests to repair his Truck . This is represented in Fig. 1. 3.4 Ontology for SDL Ontology [6] defines a common vocabulary for users to share information in a do-main. It includes definitions of basic concepts (classes) and relations among them. class hierarchy. In Example 1, there are tw o class hierarchies needed to represent the relations of classes related to Vehicle and World (see Fig. 2). 4.1 Possibility and Necessity Measures Between Two Classes To permit partial match, we use degree of possibility and necessity to represent confi-dence level that a service-agent can provide the relevant service for request-agent. The matchmaking mechanism quantifies the possibility and necessity of matching between two classes by computing a similarity between two classes in a class hierarchy. unique degree of similarity, denoted as 12 (, ) Sc c , ranging from 0 to 1. denoted by 12 (, ) CS c c . We have: where (, ) su x y indicates that x is a superclass of y . by 12 (, ) Sc c . We have: For example, (, )070.8 SVanTruck = X  in Fig. 2 . Inspired by the concepts of degrees of consistence and implication proposed by Ruspini [7], we define degrees of consistence and implication between two classes to quantify the confidence level that a service can fulfill a request. by 12 () Cc c  X  . We have: 
In fact, the degree of consistence between two classes can be considered as the pos-sibility measure. Therefore, 12 12 ()() ccCcc  X  X  =  X  . We have: 
In fact, the degree of implication between two classes can be viewed as the neces-sity measure. Therefore, 12 12 ()() Nc c Ic c  X =  X  . 4.2 Matching Algorithm is chosen to match the request by the following algorithm (see Fig.3(a)). Algorithm 1: Example 2. Let us consider a more complex situation in Example 1, suppose there are respectively, which denotes the confidence level about the satisfying of the precondi-triggered sequentially, and we thus obtain that the degree of necessity and possibility to serve the request by mechanic A is (0.56,1). Similarly, in the case of mechanic B , necessity measure to accomplish this request. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework for Grid service discovery, which for a service. Meanwhile we give a semantic-based service matchmaking mechanism integrated with class hierarchies, it permits a relaxed matching through possibility and necessity measures. 
Our future research work will consider service composition to collaboratively ful-fill a request.
