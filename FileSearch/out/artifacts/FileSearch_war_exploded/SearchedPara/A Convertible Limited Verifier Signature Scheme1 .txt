 In the ordinary digital signature schemes, anyone can verify signature with signer X  X  public key. However, in some case, it is not necessary for anyone to be convinced a justification of signer X  X  dishonorable message such as a bill. It is enough for a receiver only to prove a justi fication of the signature if the signer does not execute a contract. Undeniable signature scheme[2], the designated verifier signature[6] and the limited verifier signature[1] can solve this problem above. However, the undeniable signatures are only verified with the cooperation of the signer. It is very inconvenient and impractical in real life, for example, the signer should be unavailable, or refuse to verify. The designated verifier signa-ture solves the above problem, but the des ignated verifier ca n not transfer the signature to convince any third party in the designated verifier signature scheme. To overcome the above two problems, we propose a novel scheme: the limited verifier signature scheme .
 the case in which a receiver and a signer are a public office and a public officer, respectively, and a signer must sign an official document that will be published after the legal time. In such a situation, our proposed limited verifier signature scheme will be shown to be more efficient than undeniable signature schemes with respect to computation and application cost. In 1999, S.Araki et al first gave convertible limited verifier signature scheme. Unfortunately, F.G. Zhang [4] showed that the scheme was universally forgeable, and everyone can obtain the original signature from the converted signature in S.Araki et al scheme. It might result in information leak.
 Our Contribution: In this work, we propose a novel convertible limited veri-fier signature scheme based on the CDH assumption and the difficulty of solving inverse of hash function, and give proof security. Moreover, the conversion of the proposed scheme doesn X  X  need the cooperation of the original signer. The scheme has a standout property that only the limited verifier can convert the limited verifier signature into an ordinary signature, even if the original signer cannot also convert the original signature instead of the limited verifier. Due to the property, our converted signature has intrinsically the confirmation func-tion,Namely, when the signature need to be confirmed, if the limited verifier can correctly convert the original signature, then it means that the signature was produced by the original signer. When the original signer violated the rules, the limited verifier can provide a converted signature to convince a Judge that the original signature was indeed produced by the original signer.

The detail procedure is as follows: [System parameter setup] Let p, q be two large prime numbers, and satisfy p =2 q +1, g is a generator of order q and g  X  Z  X  p , h ()is collision-resistant hash function, for example (SHA-1,MD5).
 key with x A = q  X  1 , and computes the corresponding public key y A = g x A (mod p ) . A limited verifier U B randomly chooses a number x B  X  Z  X  q as his privacy key and computes the corresponding public key y B = g x B (mod p ); m denotes the signed message. [ Signing phase ]: To produce a signature on message m ,thesigner U A computes as follows: then the resultant signature is ( r 2 ,s,J ). To be secure transmission, the original signer can encrypt the signature with the public key of the limited verifier. [ First verifying phase ] : Given a signature ( r 2 ,s,J )fromthesigner U A , U B need verify whether the following equation is valid. if the signature ( r 2 ,s,J ) satisfies the equation (1), it means that the signature is valid, or else, it is invalid. [ Converting phase and the second verification ]: When confirming the sig-nature or after the legal time, the limited verifier can convert the original signa-ture produced by the signer U A into an ordinary digital signature, so that the signature can be publicly verified, Namely, everyone can verify the converted signature valid without a cooperation of the signer or the limited verifier. The conversion of the limited verifier is as follows: 1. randomly chooses a number  X   X  Z q , and computes y l = y  X  A mod p and the equation. following security analysis. Without loss of the generality, we assume that y l is the format of the exponential value of y A . Then the converted signature ( m,  X ,  X , r 2 ,y l , (  X  c,  X  s )) can be briefly denoted as ( m,  X ,  X , r 2 ,y l ). In this section, we give security analysis to our proposed signature scheme, and show that security of the scheme is based on the CDH assumption and the difficulty of solving the inverse of hash function.
 Theorem 1. Asignature ( r 2 ,s,J ) produced on message m by the honest signer must pass the verifying equation (1).
 Proof. It is obvious.
 must pass verification of the limited veri fier. Thereby, it guarantees correctness of our scheme. We demonstrate that our proposed scheme is provably secure by the following several theorems.
 Theorem 2. if an adversary can forge a signature ( r 2 ,s,J ) on message m in polynomial time in non-negligible advantage Adv ( ) , then the adversary can break the CDH assumption in polynomial time in non-negligible advantage Adv ( ) . Proof. Suppose there exists an adversary A to forge a signature ( r 2 ,s,J )onthe message m in polynomial time in non-negligible probability Adv ( ), and then there is an adversary A which can break the CDH assumption in polynomial time by performing subroutine A . input and outputs a valid signature ( r 2 ,s ,J ) on a message m which satisfies the verification equation of the limited verifier, and then the adversary A can break the CDH assumption in polynomial time in non-negligible advantage Adv ( ). ture should satisfy from the above equation, we have it means that this adversary can compute negligible advantage Adv ( ). Then he can break CDH assumption. Obviously, it is in contradiction to the difficulty of the CDH assumption.
 Remark 1. suppose an adversary Adv can forge a converted signature ( m , X  , X  ,r 2 ,y l ), and then the signature should satisfy we know the adversary Adv can compute the right side of the equation (4), then it means that he can solve the inverse of hash function. Namely, find a message m satisfying It is in contradiction with the difficulty of solving the inverse of hash function. if he chooses ( m , X  , X  ,r 2 ) to compute y satisfying the verification equation, it is equivalent to solving the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem. Theorem 3. the original signer cannot produce a converted signature nomial time in non-negligible probability .
 Proof. Though the signature ( r 2 ,J,s ) is produced by the signer, and he can instead of the limited verifier.
 y ) on message m . Because the signature ( r 2 ,J,s ) is produced by him, and he can by the limited verifier; then the signature ( m,  X  , X  ,r 2 ,y l ) should satisfy Hence, we have Whereas, we know that the signature ( m,  X ,  X , r 2 ,y l ) converted by the limited verifier satisfies the above equation (5) and (6), thus the original signer can compute the privacy key of the limited verifier: g in polynomial time in non-negligible probability. It is in contradiction with the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem in finite field. Hence, it satisfies the non-replaceability. In some cases, we needn X  X  be any one to verify signature valid. In this paper, we proposed a provably secure convertible limited verifier signature scheme without the random oracle model. Security of th e scheme is based on the CDH assumption and the difficulty of solving inversion of hash function. The limited verifier can independently convert the original signature into the ordinary without the help of the original signer. It is open problem to design a designated oriented-group limited verifier signature scheme.
