 Research in ranking networked entities is widely applica-ble to many problems such as optimizing search engines, building recommendation systems and discovering influen-tial nodes in social networks. However, many famous rank-ing approaches like PageRank are limited to solving this problem in homogeneous networks and are not applicable to heterogeneous networks. Faced with this problem, we propose a co X  X anking method to evaluate scientific publica-tions and authors. This novel approach is a flexible frame-work based on a set of customized rules taking into account both topological features of networks and the included ci-tations. The approach ranks authors and publications it-eratively and uses the results of each round to reinforce the ranks of authors and publications. Unlike traditional approaches to assessing publication, which require a great number of citations, our method lowers this requirement. This co X  X anking approach has been validated using data col-lected from DBLP and CiteSeer, and the results suggest that it is effective and efficient in ranking authors and publica-tions based on limited numbers of citations in heterogeneous networks and that it has fast convergence.

Research on quantitatively evaluating researchers X  contri-butions has become an increasingly hot topic because of its practical importance for making decisions in science, such as matters of individual promotion and allocation of grants.
Naturally, the quality and quantity of publications has a significant contribution on assessing researcher performance. As a result, bibliometric indicators such as citation counts, publication numbers and different types and versions of im-pact factor [12, 21, 16] are widely used. These methods are based on a natural rule that high quality papers are more likely to attract recognition and be cited frequently. In fact, fetching accurate and complete citation networks is challeng-ing and results may be controversial [29]. For example, sur-vey and review papers are generally more frequently cited than other papers, but this may not be a measure of the quality of research. Taking all references and citations into consideration results in very dense and complex academic networks. Furthermore the complexity of computation also increases as papers often have more than twenty references.
Accordingly, a great amount of research has been con-cerned with ranking entities of networks and qualifying their importance based on the topological structure of networks. Many different centrality measurements have been proposed and applied [33, 30, 4]. For example, a vertex could be ranked highly if it has many neighbors or a short average distance to other nodes. However, most centrality measure-ments are introduced and applied on homogeneous networks which contain only one type of node and relationship. By contrast, in the real world, we have to consider multiple typed nodes and relations simultaneously. For example, net-works could contain coauthorship, citation and authorship relationships. Coauthorship relationships are between au-thors. Citation is between publications and authorship is between authors and publications. Networks of this sort are heterogeneous information networks [27].

So as to overcome the problem of involvement of too many citations and extend the ranking approach to heterogeneous networks, in this paper we propose a new approach to link analysis for co X  X anking authors and their publications to-gether in coauthorship, authorship and citation networks. The proposed co X  X anking approach is a novel and flexible ranking framework to evaluate authors and publications si-multaneously in an iterative process on heterogeneous net-works. Experiments on real world datasets suggest that this approach is more effective, more efficient and more flexible than other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, for effec-tiveness, the results of our ranking require less citations than those of PageRank and HITS, both using a much larger set of references. In terms of efficiency, the complexity of com-putation for our approach is lower than PageRank. Fur-thermore, our approach is more flexible because it can be customized by defining and changing the rule set.

The contributions of this paper are summarized as follow-ing: 1. We introduce a novel co X  X anking framework for entity 2. The proposed approach is adapted to rank authors and 3. This model combines the methods based on citations 4. We evaluate the flexibility of our approach by allow-5. One assessment of ranking approaches is introduced
The rest of this paper starts from reviewing related work (Sec. 2) of ranking entities in both homogeneous and het-erogeneous networks followed by describing the experimental dataset in Sec. 3. The core ranking method and its imple-mentation are covered in Sec. 4 and Sec. 5 respectively. Re-sults and extensive case studies are presented in Sec. 6 and a conclusion commenting on our proposed method is given in Sec. 7.
The history of ranking scientists and their work can be traced back to the 1960s [13]. Since then, citations have been used as a major source to evaluate scientific literature. In 1972, Garfield [12] proposed a citation matrix (the Sci-ence Citation Index) to evaluate the importance of journals, the first time that papers were systematically ranked using a large dataset. The matrix not only introduced a way to assess journals but also publishers by the journal impact fac-tor (JIF) [11]. Later, he refined this method by taking more attributes into consideration, such as disciplines, and assign-ing weights to publishers recursively. In particular, incoming citations from more authoritative journals contributed more weight to the others cited and prestigious publishers gave more weight to journals. Similarly, notable researchers tend to publish in more authoritative journals. However, those findings failed to attract enough attention and simpler mea-sures remain in use today.

Using citations to evaluate a publication is similar to a voting mechanism. This idea motivated Brin and Page to invent the famous PageRank algorithm [5] to rank web pages and the Google search engine is based on this. Kleinberg [17] initially extended the ranking work from homogeneous net-works to heterogeneous networks. His famous method, the Hyperlink Induced Topic Search (HITS), confirms that rank-ing can be reinforced through interactions between nodes of various types. As a result, many famous papers with a few citations can be assigned high ranks. Since then, numerous papers on link analysis X  X ased ranking based on PageRank or HITS have appeared [2, 10]. A recent work [32] looks into the co X  X anking problem by applying PageRank on each relation separately and then using random walks to balance ranking results of different types of nodes.

Recent advances in graph theory and corresponding meth-ods have enriched ranking methods by incorporating topo-logical features. It is believed that if a paper or its authors are located in a key position in networks, they can be per-ceived to be important. Many centralities [25] are proposed to achieve this purpose. Liu et al. [23] compared the rank-ings of scientists by PageRank with three other rankings us-ing degree, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality. The results confirmed that centrality measures are effective each with their own advantages and that without consid-ering citations, famous but not so highly cited papers are ranked very high. Another work [8] exploits social links and uses local information only to find the top-k users in a co-authorship network based on a probabilistic model using random walks.

Finally, Han [27] implemented a low-cost clustering method based on a new ranking approach called Authority Ranking. The main idea is that the rank of an object in a hetero-geneous network is determined by its authority and that authors can be clustered by authority. For example, highly ranked authors tend to attend highly ranked venues and highly ranked venues attract highly ranked authors. The approach is applied to co-ranking authors and venues on the DBLP dataset and experimental results are very effective. This novel idea of ranking inspired us greatly and we mod-ify and extend authority ranking to be adaptable to co-rank authors and publications.

Nevertheless, to our best knowledge, we are not aware of any attempts to do ranking of both authors and publi-cations simultaneously considering citation and topological features. Accordingly, we propose a co-ranking framework to comprehensively address the ranking problem in hetero-geneous networks.
The dataset depicting the heterogeneous network used in our experiment is built from the DBLP digital library [22] and website [14]. The latest version of the DBLP 1 dataset includes more than 1.8 million publications by 0.8 million authors. Those records provide a way to trace the work of researchers and to retrieve bibliographic details when com-posing lists of references for new papers. However, it fails to provide citation relations among publications and this is the reason why we need to refer to the CiteSeer 2 database which is a popular search engine and digital library with a collection of 1.2 million scientific documents.

In the experiment, we treat data from DBLP as our main information as it has a clear and effective mechanism to process name disambiguation. CiteSeer mainly provides in-formation about citations. In the formed heterogeneous aca-demic network, each vertex represents an author who pub-lished at least one paper in one of the major venues for the data mining and database communities between 2006 and 2010. Each edge links two authors who co-authored at least one paper. The vertex properties are the number of publi-cations in each of the 10 selected conferences. http://dblp.uni-trier.de/ http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/ Table 1: Statistics of the academic network used to validate the proposed co-ranking approach Figure 1: An example of a bibliographic informa-tion network that we use for co-ranking. Authors are connected by coauthorship in an author layer while publications are linked by citation in a publi-cation layer. Authorship connects authors and pub-lications across the layers. Circles represent authors and rectangles represent publications.

We gathered different citation sets to test the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed co X  X anking framework. As our method has a low requirement for number of citations, we just kept those references which belong to the set of selected publications. Moreover, we also collected a citation set for the selected publications which contains 67,258 references and 282,463 citation relationships for comparison.
This section begins with a discussion of the problem defi-nition followed by a description of the data model.
Consider a bibliographic information network (Fig. 1) with two types of entities (authors and publications) and multi-ple typed relations (citation, coauthorship and authorship). The heterogeneous network is comprised of a coauthorship network connecting authors. The citation network connects papers and the bipartite authorship network ties the previ-ous two networks together. Unlike traditional ranking ap-proaches which just focus on one type of entity and relation-ship, our aim is to find significant authors satisfying rules of the co-authorship network, citation network and authorship network. Details about the rules will be given in Sec. 5.1. Figure 2: Data model of the proposed co-ranking framework.
A heterogeneous network of authors and publications is denoted as G = ( V,E ), where V is the set of vertices and E = V  X  V the set of edges. The network G is constituted by three sub-networks: the co-authorship network G A , the citation network G P and the authorship network G AP .
G A = ( V A ,E A ) is the weighted undirected graph (co-authorship network) of authors. V A is the set of authors, while E A is the set of edges, representing co-authorships. The number of authors is n = | V A | and the set of authors is V A = ( a 1 ,  X  X  X  ,a n ).

G P = ( V P ,E P ) is the unweighted directed graph (cita-tion network) of publications, where V P is the publication set, E P is the set of links, representing citations between publications. The number of publications is m = | V P | . In-dividual documents are denoted as V P = ( p 1 ,  X  X  X  ,p m )
G AP = ( V AP ,E AP ) is the weighted bipartite graph rep-resenting authorship. V AP = V A  X  V P . Edges in E AP con-nect each publication with all of its authors. In the author-ship network, we take the order of authors into considera-tion. The weight of author a i to publication p j is defined as w
AP ( a i ,p j ) = 1 /order ( a i ,p j ), where order ( a i tion to retrieve the position of author a i in the naming list of publication p j . For example, the weight of first author is 1, and that of n th author is 1 /n .
For the purpose of storing and calculating weights easily, we use matrix (Equ. 1) to represent this bi-typed biblio-graphic network G .
 where M is the adjacency matrix of the network G , and M
AA , M AP , M P A and M P P each denotes a type of rela-tion between authors ( A ) and publications ( P ). The weight of author X  X uthor ( M AA ) edges is the number of co-authored papers. M AP indicates the number of papers that an author has published taking into consideration the order of the au-thor lists. The citation relationships are described in M M
P A is the transposed matrix of M AP .
In this section, we describe and explain our proposed co-ranking approach in detail. The proposed ranking method is an extension of Han X  X  Authority Ranking [27] which was originally created to rank venues through authors. Unlike traditional ranking app-roaches, this method is based on a set of rules to rank entities and reinforce ranking results by a recursive ranking process. In our work, we extend this method to co-rank authors and publications simultaneously. The rules, given below, have parameters (  X  pp , X  ap , X  aa , X  pa ) taking values ranging from 0 to 1, which determine how much weight to put on each rule. The values for these parameters can be assigned based on experience, special requirements or experimental datasets. In this paper, we assign them to be 1, which means that we consider each relationship equally.
 The four rules are:
Rule 1 : Highly ranked papers tend to cite other highly ranked papers.
 In this equation, a publication j is ranked highly if the m papers which refer to it, indexed by k , have high ranking scores.

Rule 2 : Highly ranked authors publish many highly ranked papers.
 The above equation describes that author ranking scores are determined by the quantity and quality of papers they publish. A high rank publication j with rank Rank P ( j ) can increase the ranking score of author i .

Rule 3 : Highly ranked authors tend to co-author with other highly ranked authors.

Rule 4 : Highly ranked authors generally publish highly ranked papers.

The above ranking rules show clearly that publications are ranked through other publications and authors and that authors are also ranked through publications and other au-thors. Thus the co X  X anking framework is based on a mutual reinforcement by repeatedly ranking authors and publica-tions.

Figure 3 illustrates our approach for co X  X anking. It shows that apart from application of the four ranking rules, there is a starting point and an end point to this co X  X anking frame-work. The main contents of initial status are to choose a start point of this repeating process. According to the dataset, it is reasonable to start ranking publications by ci-tations. This is in the  X  X nitial phase X  in Fig. 3. In this phase, there are many approaches we can choose to rank publica-tions, ranging from basic in X  X egree counting, through to ran-dom walk or the advanced PageRank. However, the choice does not strongly affect the final results, as the mutually ranking processes stably converge to the primary eigenvector of M AA , M AP , M P A and M P P respectively [28]. According to the end point, users, certainly, can choose the number of Figure 3: The flow between different rules in the co-ranking method. iterations. Another way of controlling the number of itera-tions is to use the difference between the current iteration and the previous iteration. That is, where | V | is the number of vertices of network G and func-tion rank ( i,t + 1) is the ranking score of vertex i in the t + 1th iteration.

Another key point in this framework is normalization. Af-ter each round of co X  X anking, we normalize the matrices M
AA , M AP , M P A and M P P . Although this does not change the ranking position of objects, it gives a relative importance score to each object.

The time complexity of the proposed co X  X anking frame-work is O ( t | E | ), where t is the number of iterations through the framework and | E | is the number of edges in the ho-mogeneous network. Our proposed ranking method gives an importance measure to each type of entity based on the whole network, rather than its local neighbourhood.
Evaluating ranking results is a challenge because differ-ent ranking approaches have different definitions of impor-tance. Furthermore, when we address ranking problems in heterogeneous networks, the weights of different relations can differ. For example, in our proposed ranking method, we regard authorship, co X  X uthorship and citations as con-tributing to author and publication importances equally.
Here we propose a way to assess different ranking ap-proaches using their correlation. Considering two ranking approaches a and b , r a ( w ) and r b ( w ) are two sets containing the top w ranked entities on a dataset. The correlation of two ranking methods can be defined as
If we take the positions of elements in r a ( w ) and r into consideration, the correlation of the two methods a and b is computed as CP ( a,b ) = where function F ( r a ,i ) is calculates the position of element i in the set r a ( w ). If i /  X  r a ( w ), F ( r a ,i ) = 0.
The main reason for this evaluation is to evaluate the ef-fectiveness of new ranking methods, as it provides a way to compare new approaches with existing ones. In our ex-periment, we evaluate our proposed co X  X anking approach with two state-of-the-art methods, PageRank and HITS, for ranking publications and authors respectively. 1. Ranking publications 2. Ranking authors
This section describes the experimental settings and re-sults, followed by the performance evaluation.
Following the strategy presented in Sec. 4, we load au-thors, publications, and co X  X uthorship and authorship re-lationships from the DBLP dataset together with citations from the CiteSeer dataset and build the academic network in heterogeneous form. Before running our co X  X anking method, we perform a simple statistical analysis of the graph densi-ties (defined as | E | / | V | ). Fig. 4 shows the graph densities of co X  X uthorship ( G A ), citation ( G p ) and authorship ( G networks. The major links are from co X  X uthorship relation-ships rather than citation relationships as we constrain the selection of references to belong only to the selected set of pa-pers. Overall, this heterogeneous network is still very sparse ( | E | | N | 2 ). Accordingly, the generated matrices M M
AP , M P A and M P P are sparse which means that most elements are zero. Therefore, a better approach to acceler-ating the co X  X anking process is to compress these matrices by removing rows and columns that are all zeros.
As mentioned, although the initial step contributes little to the final ranking results, we choose to rank publications by citations as our starting point because the number of citations is an indispensable index to rank the papers and assessment of publications before co X  X anking can accelerate the rate of convergence. In this phase, we estimate the im-portance of papers by applying a citation count on network G
The iterative process of co X  X anking is shown in Fig. 5. In the initial phase, citation count is applied to rank the pub-lications and that authors are unranked. However, due to the limited number of citations, most publications have a very low value (from 0 to 0.1) except for some widely cited papers such as [18] and [3]. Highly ranked papers in this phase have the common feature that they are very general and therefore receive many citations. After the first itera-tion, more than 50% of publications are assigned relatively large rank ranging from 0.2 to 1 and authors are ranked based on co X  X uthorship, authorship and ranking scores of publications. After the third iteration, the distributions of both publication and author ranks show a similar pattern. Nevertheless, most authors have low ranks. From iteration 5 on, distributions of both papers and authors are becoming consistent and stable, showing a Gaussian distribution. It is interesting to see that most low ranked authors are students or junior researchers with a few papers.

We list the top 10 papers and authors by the co X  X anking approach (Tab. 2). It is pleasing to see that the researchers and papers are all highly ranked in DBLP and CiteSeer when taking all the citations into consideration. This means our approach is effective in ranking authors and papers with limited citations. The paper  X  X ondrian multidimensional k -anonymity X  [20] is the highest ranked paper as it is coau-thored by two top 10 ranked authors: David J. DeWitt and Raghu Ramakrishnan. Han is usually ranked after Srivas-tava in many experiments [32, 27] as Srivastava has co X  authored more papers. In fact, when considering the order of authors in papers, Han outperforms Srivastava as he is often the first or second author. Another interesting finding is that the top 10 ranked papers are from three conferences: SIGMOD (accounting for 4 of the top 10 papers), ICDE (4) and VLDB (2), which implies that these three venues have higher ranks than others. This result is also confirmed by Han X  X  experiment [27] ranking venues using a combined ranking and clustering framework.
After ranking, we compared the results of our proposed co X  X anking approach with other ranking methods (Tab. 3) by choosing the top 100 ranked authors and publications af-pairs of graphs shows the distributions of publication and author ranks. ter 20 iterations. The most interesting finding is that the ranking results of the co X  X anking method with limited ci-tations are similar to those of PageRank and HITS with a complete set of citations. The results of PageRank and HITS using limited citations is not satisfactory, giving the low cor-relation values of 0.62 for publications and 0.82 for authors. The less the number of citations, undoubtedly, decreases the cost of computation. As a result, it can be safely concluded that our co X  X anking is effective as we can get similar results compared with PageRank and HITS with a limited number of citations. The major advantage of our ranking method is flexibility. It allows users to take multi X  X yped entities and relationships into consideration simultaneously based on a given set of rules. Meanwhile, modifying the parameters of rules can easily change the relative weight of relationships. C ( PageRank,Co  X  ranking ) 0.62
CP ( PageRank,Co  X  ranking ) 0.54 C ( PageRank,Co  X  ranking ) 0.92 CP ( PageRank,Co  X  ranking ) 0.88 C ( HITS,Co  X  ranking ) 0.82
CP ( HITS,Co  X  ranking ) 0.76 C ( HITS,Co  X  ranking ) 0.94 CP ( HITS,Co  X  ranking ) 0.91
Figure 6: Convergence of Ranking Computation
The rates of convergence of co X  X anking on limited cita-tions compared to PageRank and HITS using a complete set of citations are illustrated in Fig. 6. It is clear the rank-ing scores converged very quickly in our co X  X anking method, while the other two ranking approaches converge relatively slow, partly because they work on the complete set of cita-tions. HITS converges more quickly than PageRank as in our experiment. The reason for this is that we apply HITS to rank authors by publications and their ranks, which are determined by PageRank on the complete set of citations.
Most current ranking methods on heterogeneous networks are extensions of famous ranking methods on homogeneous networks such as PageRank or HITS. This paper proposes a new co X  X anking method by setting up rules about relation-ships between high ranking publications and authors. Ex-periments on a real world data set suggest that the proposed co X  X anking approach is effective on academic networks even having only a small set of citations. Our approach over-comes the limited number of citations by ranking authors and publications mutually. The proposed co X  X anking frame-work is based on a set of rules which confers flexibility to our method. Experimental results illustrate that the rules can be customised easily, for example to consider the order of authors on publications, and that this has a strong effect on the results.

Possible directions of future research include: (1) testing our approach on dense networks, as the derived academic networks tend to be sparse; (2) deriving a formal analysis of the new co X  X anking framework is required including the effect of rule parameters on the ranking results, the speed of convergence, stability, etc.; and (3) extending our co X  ranking framework to include clustering. Finally, the exper-imental dataset used in this paper covers the major database and data mining conferences. We would like to extend the experiments to consider academic networks in other domains that have different publishing practices than computing. [1] D. J. Abadi, D. S. Myers, D. J. DeWitt, and S. R.
