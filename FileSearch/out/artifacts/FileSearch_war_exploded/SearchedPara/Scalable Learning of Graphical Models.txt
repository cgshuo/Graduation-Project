 From understanding the structure of data, to classification and topic modeling, graphical models are core tools in ma-chine learning and data mining. They combine probabil-ity and graph theories to form a compact representation of probability distributions. In the last decade, as data stores became larger and higher-dimensional, traditional al-gorithms for learning graphical models from data, with their lack of scalability, became less and less usable, thus directly decreasing the potential benefits of this core technology. To scale graphical modeling techniques to the size and di-mensionality of most modern data stores, data science re-searchers and practitioners now have to meld the most re-cent advances in numerous specialized fields including graph theory, statistics, pattern mining and graphical modeling.
This tutorial covers the core building blocks that are nec-essary to build and use scalable graphical modeling tech-nologies on large and high-dimensional data.

Learning graphical models from data is a core machine learning and data mining technology, both for its own sake and as a enabler to the many technologies that rely on it. This is for several reasons:
The tutorial is aimed at anyone with a general background in data mining or machine learning. We anticipate three main profiles of researchers and data practitioners that could be interested in this tutorial: 1. General data mining/machine learning researchers who 2. PhD students who want to be brought up to speed 3. Data practitioners and domain experts who want to
The main principles and models are explained illustra-tively, but we present some advanced statistical techniques which require knowledge on basic mathematical concepts (undergraduate level mathematics).
This tutorial will draw on major following work from the literature: [4, 8, 11, 5, 6, 3, 9, 17, 1, 2, 7, 10, 14, 12, 13, 16, 15].
