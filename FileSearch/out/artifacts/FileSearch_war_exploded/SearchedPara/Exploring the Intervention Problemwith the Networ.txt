 Intervention is pervasive in many fields: some insignificant events may cause a great disturbance on the internet by a small group of intended online promoters; some tiny mutations of an single gene may cause the critical illnesses for human; several news events may result the financial crisis for the whole world.
To study the rules of the intervention phenomenon in the microblog from a heterogeneous network view, our main contributions of this paper are: (1) propos-ing the networked Poisson process (NPP) to model the patterns for the dynamic tweeting process in the social network b y considering the interaction between the latent features of people, and propo sing a parameters learning algorithm, NPP-learning, to generate the NPP model ; (2) formalizing the concepts about the intervention and defining the problem of the intervening impact maximiza-tion(IIM); proving that the problems IIM is NP-hard;(3) proposing algorithms greedy-IIM to find the solutions for the problems IIM; (4) providing the experi-ments on the real microblog data to verify the effectiveness of our methods. We extend the methods in [1] to define the heterogeneous social network. Definition 1. Heterogeneous Social Network. Let V be a set of users from R types X = { X r } R r =1 , then a heterogeneous social network is a weighted graph G = V,E,W ,where R  X  2 ;edgeset E is the relations between the users in V , and W is the set of the trust degrees among the users v 1 , v 2 (  X  v 1 ,v 2  X  E ). Definition 2. Networked Poisson Process (NPP) model. Let G be a het-erogeneous social network with 2 types of users ( X r 1 = intended, X r 2 =or-dinary), then { N ( t ) v }  X  v  X  V is a networked poisson process, where N ( t ) v is a Poisson-distributed random variable with  X  v,t representing the tweeting rate of v at time t; for  X  v in type X r 1 ,  X  v,t  X   X  v ( t =0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ... ) ;for  X  v  X  V and v in type X r 2 , the initial  X  v, 0 is the initial tweeting rate of v ,and  X  v,t for t&gt; 0 can
In definition 2, NBS ( v ) is the neighbors X  set of v in G , W u,v is u  X  X  trust degree toward v ,  X  (  X   X  [0 , 1]) is a priori parameter to adjust the weight of the social relationships; T is the average time period for the observation;  X  v is a constant, and it measures the  X  X weeting times per hour X  of v .
 Definition 3. Intervening Action and Impact. Given a heterogeneous so-cial network G = V,E,W with 2 types of users ( X r 1 = intended, X r 2 = ordinary), an intervening action of v ( v  X  V ), A ( v ) r 2 ,r 1 , happens when v turns his role from X r 2 to X r 1 ;If A ( v ) r 2 ,r 1 takes place by setting v  X  X  tweeting rate to  X  v , then the intensity of the A ( v ) r 2 ,r 1 is  X  v ; denote this intensity as I ( A ( v ) r 2 ,r 1 ) =  X  v ;The intervening impact of S ( S  X  V )on G , Y ( S | G ) T,T , can be calculated by the equation: Y ( S | G ) T,T = E (  X  v  X  V | N ( v ) T  X  N ( v ) T | ) .
Where T and T are two non-intersected time periods; N ( v ) T and N ( v ) T are the simulated tweeting numbers for v by the NPP model within T and T . In the rest sections, when the context is fixed, we use A ( v )toinstead A ( v ) r 2 ,r 1 and simplify Y ( S | G ) T,T to Y ( S | G )or Y ( S ).
 Problem 1. Intervening Impact Maximization, IIM. Given a heterogeneous social network G = V,E,W and its corresponding NPP in the time period T 0 , suppose  X  v  X  V are in type X r 1 initially; the problem IIM is to find out the best set S ( S  X  V ) with k users to make the maximum Y ( S | G ) T 0 ,T by taking the intervening action A ( v )for  X  v in S with the fixed  X   X  in a time period T . Theorem 1. The problem IIM is NP-hard.
 Proof. By the definition 2 and 3, for a set S 1 of intended users, we have: (in type X r 2 ) will be in the set of NBS ( v ), the increasing speed of NBS ( v ) S 1 is slower than S 1 .Thenwiththetwosets: S 1 , S 2 ( S 1  X  S 2 )and v ( v /  X  S 1 ), the equation Y ( S 1 { v }| G )  X  Y ( S 1 | G )  X  Y ( S 2 { v }| G )  X  Y ( S 2 | G ) holds. There-fore, Y ( S | G ) is a non-negative monotone submodular function, by [2], to search aset S of k users to maximize Y ( S | G ) is NP-hard, and the greedy algorithms canbeappliedonittomakea(1-1 e )-approximation [3]. Algorithm for the NPP Learning. We list the detail steps of the algorithm NPP-learning in the algorithm 1. Where  X  X oisson-random( u,  X  u ) T  X  is a Poisson random number in time period T ( D test ); D train and D test are the training and testing set, and the  X  is a vector of the  X  v for  X  v in V .
 Algorithm for IIM. The pesudocode of the algorithm for IIM is listed in the algorithm 2. In algorithm 2, the function  X  X rg max v  X   X  V (*) X  contains the detail steps to search the best node to make the maximum intervening impact. Data Set and Configs. We extracted the tweets and user relations related to 3 hot topics on Twitter. The details of this data are listed in the table 1. We set the trust degrees to 1 for all the pairs of users to simplify the computation. Parameters Learning for the NPP. Figure 3 records the results of the ex-periments about the parameters learning for NPP. One can see from figure 3 that the learning error (RMSE) for NPP is converging with the progress. We did another 2 experiments on the topics  X #GalaxyS4 X  and  X #NBAplayoffs X , and both results show the similar converging rules. The more, with the decreasing of  X  , the learning error is getting smaller. This proves that the tweeting behaviors of the users in Twitter are really affected by their social relations. Comparison for NPP, IC, LT. We implemented the algorithms greedy-IC and greedy-LT by following [4][5]. We compare the intervening impacts and the information spreading range for the top users discovered by the algorithms in the table 2. As it is shown in the table 2, the greedy-IIM found out the set S with the biggest intervening impacts and the information spreading range. In this paper, we model the microblog as a heterogeneous network, propose the NPP model to capture the tweeting behav iors for the users in the microblog, and address a NP-hard problem: the intervening impact maximization (IIM). Then, we propose the algorithm NPP-learning to learn the NPP model, and propose the algorithm greedy-IIM to solve the IIM. Our experiments show that NPP captured the real interaction patterns for the users in the microblog, and greedy-IIM can discover the users to make more intervening impact than the results of greedy-IC and greedy-LT. Our future work will focus on the knowledge discovering in a heterogeneous network with more than two types of individuals. The more, how to predict the best time or the users to take actions and how to apply our methods to solve the intervention problems in other fields are also the interesting and challenging topics for our future research.
