Group Recommender Systems (GRS) suffers from a main barrier: how to formulate group profile as preferences of members are conflicting.
 er occasionally or randomly, not because of social relation or anything in com-mon (e.g. passengers occasionally taking the same airplane). Existing relevant researches primarily concentrate on aggregation of group members and can be aggregate members X  ratings towards candidate items into a single value as group profile by simple aggregation functions like average. The latter merge members X  recommended lists into a singe list for the group by similar aggregation functions. Nevertheless, single aggregated values fail to distinguish conflicting characteris-tics of groups, and thus cannot well reflect actual group profile. Fig. 1 gives an typical example of such case. Let mean value  X  denote aggregated group profile and variance value  X  2 denote conflicting degree of the group. Though  X  A and  X  B are close, Group B is more heterogeneous than Group A.

Thus, a novel G roup Re commender System From the Perspective of P reference distribu tion ( Greption ) is proposed. First, idea of Label Distribution Learning (LDL) [4] is introduced to finely model group profile. Then, by proposing a modified VIKOR method, we transform the pro-cess of selecting items for a group into a multi-criteria decision making process (MCDM).

Existing relevant researches primarily concentrate on aggregation of group mem-bers and can be divided into two categories: aggregation of individual ratings and aggregation of individual recommendation lists.
 each member a member contribution score and aggregates members X  profiles in-to the group profile. In [5], Kagita et al. took transitive precedence of items of all members into consideration to construct a virtual user to represent group. In [6], Kim et al. presented a recommender system that adopt graph-based approach to model relation between users and items, and then aggregated members into historical records, and then proposed a NLMS method to suggest group rec-ommendations. In [12], Ortega et al. aggregated members by average method performed group recommendations using Matrix Factorization based Collabora-tive Filtering.
 each item, and items are ranked accordingly. Then, rankings are aggregated. In [1], Baltrunas et al. aggregated the individual lists of recommendations pro-duced by a collaborative filtering system to realize group recommendation. In [9], Meena et al. developed a novel approach based on Kemeny optimal aggre-gation using genetic algorithm to aggregate rankings. In [14], Salehi et al. firstly predicted unknown individual preference with form of ranking through proba-bilistic inference, and then aggregated the individual preferences into a whole by simple aggregation.
 of group members. Some aggregate individual ratings, while some aggregate individual rankings. However, these methods cannot well reflect comprehensive group profile in terms of conflicting characteristics. In this section, we first introduce framework of the Greption Mechanism shown in Fig. 2. Then, its mathematical modeling is described. 3.1 Framework Suppose that a number of users make up a group G , and that a set of candidate items I = { I 1 ,I 2 ,...,I M } will be recommended to the group. In order to gener-ate group profile, LDL is introduced to formulate a model to predict group profile on candidate items. To estimate model parameters, user registry that contains historical items X  ratings given by group members will be input as training set. The obtained group profile on items I l ( l = 1 , 2 ,...,M ) is a type of preference distribution, and is represented as d y I gested on the basis of predicted group profile. To achieve this, we transform the process into a MCDM and a modified VIKOR method is proposed. Finally, top-m recommendation result for the group, represented as L G = { L 1 ,L 2 ,...,L m } , can be suggested by ranking candidate items accordingly. 3.2 Modeling of Prediction of Group Profile LDL is a general learning framework that views each instance as a distribution of labels rather than a single label or multiple labels. In a label distribution, a real number P y  X  [0 , 1] is assigned to each label y , representing the degree that the corresponding label describes the instance. The numbers for all the labels sum to 1, meaning full description of the instance.
 set contains a number of users constituting a group G as well as n items rat-ed by users, and that the ratings given by users comprise c levels. And not note items of training set. Let y j ( j = 1 , 2 ,...,c ) denote all the labels. And let P ( y j ) denote label distribution of x i . The input space of LDL is obtained as is to learn a conditional p.d.f. d  X  R c with parameters: where  X  is the vector of parameters. Due to the fact that degree that each label describes an item is in range of [0 , 1], the description degree of labels of x i is modeled utilizing logistic function: W  X  R c and b  X  R c are the model parameters.
 sion analysis can be adopted to solve it. Logistic regression cannot well deal with operations with high computational complexity, thus is not suitable for learning from label distribution. Therefore, Multi-dimensional support vector regression (MSVR) [15] is instead employed to solve the problem, leading to solving the following optimization problem: In MSVR, L 1 norm-based loss function will be calculated for each dimension independently, which will make solution complexity grow with the number of dimensions [15]. Instead, loss function is expected to be formulated as L 2 norm: In order to predict group preference distribution, it is expected to learn model parameters by finding solution of 3. Unfortunately, substituting Eq. (2), (4)-(6) into Eq. (3) cannot lead to a convex quadratic form. Therefore, it is hard to find the optimum as well as to apply the kernel trick. [3] proposed an alternative loss function [3] which can reform the Eq. (3) to a convex quadratic programming process: minimizing the following target function: It is still hard to obtain exact problem of the transformed problem. Instead, an iterative quasi-Newton method called Iterative Re-Weighted Least Square (IR-WLS) [13] is utilized to search for approximate solution. Due to the space limit, we leave out the detailed process of derivation of optimal solution finding. Finally, the optimal solutions w j and b j can be obtained and then substituted into Eq. (2) to calculate predicted label distributions of candidate items I l ( l = 1 , 2 ,...,M ) who are to be recommended. So far, group profile d y I 3.3 Decision of Recommendation Results items for the group. However, preference distribution is highly ambiguous, and is composed by some components. Here, we propose a modified VIKOR method that incorporates fuzzy set theory, in order to transform the item selection prob-lem into a MCDM.
 ing from a set of alternatives uncertainty with conflicting criteria. To construct MCDM, following assumptions are established: VIKOR method can be described as: to find optimal ranking order for items I ( l = 1 , 2 ,...,M ) under c criteria.
 Criteria Assessment: As c criteria possess different meanings, we firstly adopt fuzzy set theory to assess the nature of criteria. Here, the c criteria are divided into three clusters C 1 , C 2 , and C 3 with the aid of membership function: where Decision Matrix Generation: A pseudo decision maker is simulated to as-sess criteria values of item I l ( j = 1 , 2 ,...,M ) and give decision scores for each utility. And for criteria of C 1 , higher values imply dissatisfaction. Their decision scores are assumed to range from 0 to 100. Yet criteria of C 2 are relatively neu-tral, their decision scores are not expected to be too high or too low, and are assumed to range between two positive integers a 1 and a 2 . Therefore, decision score of criteria can be calculated as follows: where Z lj denotes the decision score of j th criteria of l th item. Thus, decision matrix D of the pseudo decision maker can be constructed: Item Ranking: For all criteria, we denote the best value by f  X  j and the worst value by f  X  j . Due to different nature of three categories of criteria, best value and worst value can be determined as follows: We denote the aggregated value of l th item with a maximum group utility by S l and compute as following formula: We denote the aggregated value of l th item with a minimum individual regret of  X  X pponent X  by R l and compute as following formula: where w j is the weight of criterion j , and is initially defined as: We denote value of benefit ratio for l th item by Q l and compute as following formula: where  X  is a weight for the strategy of maximum group utility, and 1  X   X  is the weight of individual regret.
 spectively in ascending order, obtaining three ranking lists. If the following two conditions are satisfied simultaneously, then the scheme with minimum value of Q in ranking is considered the optimal solution. The two conditions are: i. Acceptable advantage: ii. Acceptable stability in decision making: The item I  X  must be also the best In this section, we present an empirical study of our approach on a real dataset, and analyze the results. 4.1 Experimental Setup We employ the  X  X ovieLens 10M X  dataset 1 which includes 10681 items and 10000054 ratings from 71567 different users. And the ratings range from 1 to 5. In experiments, only users who have rated between 15 and 35 items are selected, in order to avoid the group profile covering all the items. Items that have been rated by group members but will not be recommended to the group again. The dataset is split into two parts consisting of a training set and a test set. We randomly select 60% of the data for training and 40% for testing. Groups are formed by randomly selecting users who have no explicit shared preference relevance. And the group size are set to 200, 300, and 400 respectively.
 the attributes in Tab. 1 are either numerical attributes or categorical attributes. Thus, we set a threshold  X  and re-assign a new value  X  X ther X  to those who appear less times in the dataset than the threshold, in order to simplify the complexity of data. The categorical attributes are then transformed into numerical ones by numbering each value of all the categorical attributes. Finally, all the numbers are normalized to the same scale through the min-max normalization.
 and the weight  X  in Eq. (19) is set to 0 . 5. As for the  X  X ovieLens 1M X  dataset, the number of labels is 5. 4.2 Metrics and Baselines To evaluate the proposed recommender system based on recommendation lists, we adopt normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) and F measure as metrics. siders accuracy but also takes recommendation order into account. Let L G = { L 1 ,L 2 ,...,L m } be the top-m recommendation list for group G and U be a member of group G . DCG is defined as: and the corresponding nDCG is defined as: where IDCG is the optimal possible gain value for member U where recommen-dations are re-oriented in descending order based on their ratings in the obtained list.
 whether an item is accepted as 3. Then, true positive (TP), false positive (FP), and expected recommendations (ER) are defined respectively. Among, TP and FP are defined for items recommended to group G , while ER is defined for item set I . TP for an item is when all the member ratings for that item are higher than 3 (ignoring members whose rating for the item is unknown). FP for an item is when all the member ratings are no higher than 3. ER for an item is when all the member ratings are higher than 3. Thus, F measure can be deduced as follows: To measure the improvement of our Greption approach, we implement several popular group recommendation approaches as baselines:  X  LM [10]: the group profile is generated using the least misery strategy which  X  AVG: the group profile is generated using the average strategy which gives  X  AM [8]: the group profile is generated using the average without misery  X  MCS [17]: the group profile is generated using weighted individual preference, 4.3 Results and Analysis Fig. 3 shows the nDCG results obtained by LM, AVG, AM, MCS, and our approach with the change of m and group size. And it has three subfigures, denoting results with different group size values respectively: 200, 300, and 400. Obviously, recommendation lists obtained by Greption method are more ideal that other methods, because it can model group profile more finely. Thus, higher unity gain will be obtained. In the meanwhile, different from previous methods, the Greption method is designed to serve groups with large scale. Therefore, when group size grows, Greption method has better performance.
 with the change of group size G . The values m are set to 5 and 10 respectively. Obviously, the Greption approach outperforms other methods under any group size in the experiment. The MCS method has better performance than AVG, LM, AM in most cases. However, when group size is increasing, performance of the MCS method decreases distinctly. But the proposed Greption framework can work well in the experiment.
 cale and high heterogeneity, the proposed Greption approach can attain better performance.
 In order to tackle with problems that recommend items to group of users rather than individual users, we propose Greption, a novel group recommender system from the perspective of preference distribution. Specifically, framework of Grep-tion mechanism is proposed and its mathematical modeling is described. Besides, we present a series of experiments as the demonstration of our approach X  X  effi-ciency.
