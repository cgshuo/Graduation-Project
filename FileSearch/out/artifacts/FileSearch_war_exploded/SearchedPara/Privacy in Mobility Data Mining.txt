 As mobile telecommunications and ubiquitous computing pervade our society, the location of mobile users can be con-tinuously sensed and recorded. This has given rise to a set of novel applications that deliver or manage content based on users X  location. Examples of such applications are the well-known location based services and, more recently, the loca-tion based social networks (e.g., Foursquare, Gowalla) and the participatory sensing systems (e.g., CycleSense). These applications allow users to take dynamic decisions on issues like transportation, visiting of places of interest, or meeting friends in nearby locations. Furthermore, they enable the participation of users in campaigns that involve the collec-tion of data from certain locations (through sensor-equipped mobile devices) and its transmission to remote servers to support different forms of analysis. Apart from on-line ap-plications, the recent advances in database systems have made possible the storage and processing of large amounts of mobility data that can be used to support off-line anal-ysis. All these emerging applications, arising from mobility data, pose unique challenges to the data mining community. Specifically, the mining of personal mobility data collected through these applications can produce reliable knowledge to aid traffic engineers, city managers and environmentalists towards decision making in a wide spectrum of tasks, such as urban planning, sustainable mobility, intelligent trans-portation, and environmental pollution, thereby enhancing the way we live today.
 Although mobility data represents a very useful source of information, the sharing of user location or movement infor-mation raises serious privacy concerns that need to be ad-dressed in order for data mining to be more accepted in this domain. On one side, revealing user location to untrustwor-thy service providers (e.g., for the offering of location based services) may risk privacy attacks, allowing the discovery of personal and sensitive information about the users. On the other side, publishing user trajectories to support analytic or other purposes, may come at a high cost to the privacy of the individuals whose movement is recorded in the data, once sensitive personal information is disclosed to malicious users. Privacy concerns are also important barriers for the adoption of new applications, whose offering depends on user location. As it becomes evident, in both on-line and off-line settings, sophisticated privacy-enhancing solutions are nec-essary to protect the location and mobility information of the individuals from potential privacy attacks.
 This issue is dedicated to the area of privacy preservation in the context of mobility data, which is an emerging field for the KDD community. We invited three survey articles that cover the state-of-the-art on privacy models and data trans-formation techniques for protecting user privacy in location based services, as well as the state-of-the-art on anonymiza-tion methods for privacy-aware trajectory data publishing. In addition, we invited an article that reports on interesting privacy challenges in a new class of emerging applications, known as participatory sensing , and proposes a method to address some major privacy leaks in participatory systems. To make this issue of value to the largest possible audi-ence, the invited articles are written at a level that does not require from the readers significant prior knowledge of the area, and contain several figures and examples to explain well the presented concepts. The invited papers that are published in this special issue cover different research directions in the area of privacy for mobility data. In what follows, we provide a concise sum-mary of the content that is covered in each article. The first article, titled  X  X rivacy preservation in the dissem-ination of location data X , is authored by Manolis Terrovitis and provides a survey on the attack scenarios, the offered privacy guarantees, and the data transformation approaches for protecting user privacy in the context of location based services. Location based services (LBS) and location based social networks are popular applications as they enable users to take dynamic, informed decisions on issues like trans-portation, identification of places of interest, or the oppor-tunity to meet a friend or a colleague in a nearby location. The article presents the three LBS architectures that have been considered for the communication of the users with the LBS providers, as well as elaborates on the different pri-vacy models that have been proposed in the research litera-ture and on the privacy guarantees that they offer. Attacks against user identity, user location, and user query content are discussed and analyzed, with emphasis being placed on the so-called snapshot LBS, in which only one (current) lo-cation of the user needs to be reported to the LBS provider to allow the offering of the service. Moreover, the article dis-cusses privacy challenges that arise in the context of location based social networks, and reports on recent initiatives to help users control access to their data. Some open technical i ssues and promising research directions on privacy preserv-ing location data dissemination, are also given. The second article is titled  X  X rajectory privacy in location based services and data publication X  and is authored by Chi-Yin Chow and Mohamed F. Mokbel. It surveys the state-of-the-art approaches that have been proposed for the offer-ing of privacy in the context of continuous location based services, and trajectory data publication. Unlike snapshot LBS, in continuous LBS a mobile user has to report her lo-cation to the service provider in a periodic or on-demand manner, in order to be offered the requested continuous ser-vice. Protecting location privacy in continuous LBS is a very challenging problem because adversaries can use the spatiotemporal correlations in the reported location sam-ples for the users to infer their location with higher cer-tainty and breach their anonymity. Continuous LBS can be partitioned into two categories depending on whether they require consistent user identities to offer the service, or do not require user identities. The authors discuss five families of privacy-preserving methods for continuous LBS, namely spatial cloaking , mix-zones , vehicular mix-zones , path confu-sion and fake location trajectories , and present approaches that fall in each family. Following that, they cover two well-studied trajectory anonymization approaches, namely the clustering-based approach and the generalization-based ap-proach , that have been recently proposed for the offering of privacy in trajectory data publishing. The paper concludes with some interesting directions for future research. The third invited article is titled  X  X rajectory anonymity in publishing personal mobility data X  and is authored by Francesco Bonchi, Laks V. S. Lakshmanan and Hui (Wendy) Wang. The authors survey the state-of-the-art develop-ments in anonymity-preserving data publishing of personal mobility data. Unlike the case of location based services and participatory sensing systems, where privacy has to be of-fered in an on-line, potentially dynamic, and service-centric manner, in anonymous personal mobility data publishing the goal is to construct and publish a dataset that effec-tively maintains most of the utility of the original mobility data, while it effectively protects the personal and sensi-tive information of the users from potential attackers. The approaches that have been proposed so far assume that a trusted entity collects trajectories representing the move-ment for a large number of users. This data has to be shared with a set of potentially untrustworthy entities for data anal-ysis purposes, e.g. to enable traffic optimization research. To accomplish this goal, the trusted entity has to anonymize the mobility data so that no privacy breach, based on the assumed models of adversarial attacks, may occur when the data is published. The authors categorize adversary knowl-edge into two types, namely location based knowledge , and mobility pattern-based knowledge . For each category, they explain the considered privacy model and elaborate on the anonymization methodologies that have been proposed to offer user privacy. Last, they discuss some interesting open research directions in this popular research area. The fourth invited article is titled  X  X  privacy-aware frame-work for participatory sensing X  and is authored by Leyla Kazemi and Cyrus Shahabi. It reports on some interest-ing privacy challenges that arise in the context of a new class of emerging applications, known as participatory sens-ing , in which people aim to contribute content (e.g., images, video), collected by their mobile devices, to central data servers. This content can be used at a later point to sup-port analytic tasks or other types of data processing. Par-ticipatory sensing systems can be either unsolicited (e.g., Flickr or Youtube), where users participate by arbitrarily collecting data, or campaign-based (e.g., CycleSense), when a coordinated effort of the participants is necessary to collect the data that is needed by the data server to support some purpose (e.g., collect traffic information). The authors for-mally define the problem of P rivacy-A ware P articipatory A ssignment ( PAPA ) in participatory sensing systems and introduce a privacy-aware framework that enables the par-ticipation of users to these services without compromising their location privacy. Although there exist several tech-niques for the offering of location privacy in conventional LBS, there are certain unique characteristics of participatory campaigns that constitute these approaches inapplicable. The authors propose a method, called P artical-i nclusivity and R ange i ndependence  X  PiRi , which solves the PAPA problem and is experimentally verified to be efficient. The invited articles in this issue cover the research in the two principal directions of privacy for mobility data: user privacy in location based services, and anonymity in the publication of personal mobility data. Furthermore, they report on privacy issues in emerging applications, such as location based social networks and participatory sensing sys-tems. Applications arising from mobility data pose unique challenges to the data mining community. Data mining tech-niques, when applied on data collected by location based applications, have a lot of potential in supporting decision making in tasks such as urban planning, intelligent trans-portation, and environmental pollution. However, privacy-enhancing methods are necessary to ensure that the col-lected data are protected against privacy threats. With this special issue we wanted to bring the state-of-the-art on pri-vacy issues in this newly emerging domain to the attention of the KDD community.
