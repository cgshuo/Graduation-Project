 To analyze the e ect of the oceans and atmosphere on land climate, Earth Scien tists have dev elop ed climate indices, whic h are time series that summarize the beha vior of se-lected regions of the Earth's oceans and atmosphere. In the past, Earth scien tists have used observ ation and, more recen tly, eigen value analysis techniques, suc h as principal comp onen ts analysis (PCA) and singular value decomp osi-tion (SVD), to disco ver climate indices. However, eigen value techniques are only useful for nding a few of the strongest signals. Furthermore, they imp ose a condition that all dis-covered signals must be orthogonal to eac h other, making it dicult to attac h a physical interpretation to them. This pap er presen ts an alternativ e clustering-based metho dology for the disco very of climate indices that overcomes these lim-itations and is based on clusters that represen t regions with relativ ely homogeneous beha vior. The cen troids of these clusters are time series that summarize the beha vior of the ocean or atmosphere in those regions. Some of these cen-troids corresp ond to kno wn climate indices and pro vide a validation of our metho dology; other cen troids are varian ts of kno wn indices that may pro vide better predictiv e power for some land areas; and still other indices may represen t poten tially new Earth science phenomena. Finally , we sho w that cluster based indices generally outp erform SVD deriv ed indices, both in terms of area weigh ted correlation and direct correlation with the kno wn indices.

Fig-ure 1 sho ws the correlation between the NINO 1+2 index and land temp erature anomalies, whic h are deviations from the mean. Observ e that this index is highly correlated to the land temp erature anomalies on the western coast of South America, whic h is not surprising given the pro ximit y of this region to the ocean region de ning the index. However, few outside the eld of Earth Science would exp ect that NINO 1+2 is also highly correlated to land regions that are far away from the eastern coast of South America, e.g., Africa and South-East Asia.

Most commonly used climate indices are based on sea level pressure (SLP) and sea surface temp erature (SST) in ocean regions. These indices can ease the disco very of relation-ships of SST and SLP to land temp erature and precipita-tion. These variables in turn, impact plan t gro wth, and are therefore imp ortan t for understanding the global carb on cy-cle and the ecological dynamics of the Earth.

Because of this, Earth Scien tists have dev oted a consid-erable amoun t of time to dev eloping/disco vering climate in-dices, suc h as NINO 1+2 and the other indices describ ed in Table 1. One of the approac hes used to disco ver cli-mate indices has been the direct observ ation of climate phe-nomenon. For instance, the El Nino phenomenon was rst noticed by Peruvian shermen cen turies ago. The shermen observ ed that in some years the warm south ward curren t, whic h app eared around Christmas, would persist for an un-usually long time, with a disastrous impact on shing. In the early 20th cen tury , while studying the trade winds and Indian monso on, scien tists noticed large scale changes in pressure in the equatorial Paci c region whic h they referred to as the `Southern Oscillation.' Scien tists dev elop ed a cli-mate index called the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) to capture this pressure phenomenon. In the mid and late 60's, the Southern Oscillation was conclusiv ely tied to El Nino, and their impact on global climate was recognized. Needless to say, nding climate indices in this fashion is a very slow and tedious pro cess.

More recen tly, motiv ated by the massiv e amoun ts of new data being pro duced by satellite observ ations, Earth Scien-tists have been using eigen value analysis techniques, suc h as principal comp onen ts analysis (PCA) and singular value de-comp osition (SVD), to disco ver climate indices [16]. While eigen value techniques do pro vide a way to quic kly and auto-matically detect patterns in large amoun ts of data, they also have the follo wing limitations: (i) all disco vered signals must be orthogonal to eac h other, making it dicult to attac h a physical interpretation to them, and (ii) weak er signals may be mask ed by stronger signals. These points are discussed in more detail in Section 3.

This pap er presen ts an alternativ e clustering-based metho d-ology for the disco very of climate indices that overcomes these limitations. The use of clustering is driv en by the in-tuition that a climate phenomenon is exp ected to involve a signi can t region of the ocean or atmosphere, and that we exp ect that suc h a phenomenon will be `stronger' if it in-volves a region where the beha vior is relativ ely uniform over the entire area. SNN clustering [2, 3, 4] has been sho wn to nd suc h homogeneous clusters. Eac h of these clusters can be characterized by a cen troid, i.e., the mean of all the time series describing the ocean points in the cluster, and thus, these cen troids represen t poten tial climate indices. This ap-proac h o ers a num ber of bene ts: (i) disco vered signals Figure 2: A simpli ed view of the problem domain. the `mon thly Z score' transformation, whic h tak es the set of values for a given mon th, calculates the mean and standard deviation of that set of values, and then `standardizes' the data by calculating the Z-score of eac h value, i.e., by sub-tracting o the corresp onding mon thly mean and dividing by the mon thly standard deviation. The Z-score transfor-mation also reduces temp oral auto correlation signi can tly. Since we used time series spanning 41 years (12 mon thly measuremen ts eac h year), we also detrended the data be-fore our analysis. For further details on these issues, we refer the reader to [15] and [17].
 Table 1: Description of well-kno wn climate indices. Figure 3: First righ t singular vector of SST (blue) plotted against the NINO4 index (green). Limitations of SVD Based Approac hes
The performance of SVD in the above example, is impres-sive: a well-kno wn climate index was disco vered straigh tfor-wardly . However, there are a num ber of limitations of SVD analysis, most of whic h are well-kno wn. For example, SVD nds the strongest patterns best since its goal is to pro-vide the best rank k appro ximation to a matrix, 1 k rank(data matrix) [1]. Thus, sligh tly weak er patterns may not `sho w up' as well as the stronger patterns. For this reason|as well as the orthogonalit y constrain t describ ed below|only the rst few SVD vectors are typically regarded as trust worth y. For example, in Earth science time series, seasonalit y dominates all other patterns. Thus, for SVD analysis, if the seasonalit y is not remo ved from the data, at least the rst few strongest patterns will be seasonal pat-terns of di eren t types. Indeed, other strong patterns, suc h as El Nino, emerge more clearly once seasonalit y is remo ved. However, El Nino and other strong patterns, e.g., AO, may in turn mask yet other patterns. Of course, clustering is somewhat sub ject to the same problem|small clusters are look, i.e., clusters of low or medium densit y whic h represen t relativ ely uniform regions `surrounded' by non-uniform or higher densit y areas. With resp ect to Earth Science data, SNN clustering pro duces high qualit y clusters, whic h are al-most alw ays geographically con tiguous, and automatically selects the num ber of clusters. Because of space considera-tions, we omit a detailed description of the SNN algorithm and refer the reader to [2, 4]. Note that [4] con tains exp eri-men tal results indicating that SNN clustering works better than DBSCAN or K-means when the goal is to nd clusters of relativ ely uniform densities.
To evaluate poten tial ocean climate indices, we need a nu-merical measure of the strength of the asso ciation between the beha vior of a candidate index and land climate. Earth Scien tists have traditionally used correlation [9] to measure the degree of asso ciation between two time series. In general, we are only interested in using a time series (cluster cen troid, or otherwise) as an index if it sho ws a strong correlation| positiv e or negativ e|with the beha vior of a well-de ned re-gion of the land and if the strength of that correlation is comparable to that of kno wn indices.

To evaluate the in uence of climate indices on land, we use area-weighte d correlation , whic h is the weigh ted average of the correlation of the climate index with all land points, where weigh t is based on the area of the land grid point. Area-w eigh ted correlation is computed as follo ws. We rst compute the correlation of the time series of the candidate climate index with the time series asso ciated with eac h land point. We then compute the weigh ted average of the abso-lute correlations of eac h land point, where the weigh t asso ci-ated with eac h land point is just its area. (W e use absolute correlation because we are interested in the strength of the connections between ocean/atmosphere and land, not the di-rection.) The resulting area-w eigh ted correlation value can be at most 1 (this would be the case where all land time se-ries have a correlation of 1 or -1 with the candidate index), but is normally much lower. The minim um value of area weigh ted correlation is 0.

Note that if area weigh ted correlation of a candidate index is too low, it could mean that either it is not a good index, or it impacts only a small num ber of land grid points. Accoun ting for Lags
As men tioned earlier, since the same Earth Science phe-nomenon can occur at di eren t times in di eren t places, we want to use a form of area weigh ted correlation that tak es these lags into accoun t. Thus, it is necessary to compute the area-w eigh ted correlation for various shifts. This in-volves shifting two time series to sim ulate leads (lags) of up to six mon ths, computing the correlation, and then taking the `best' (highest positiv e or negativ e value) as the corre-lation. This pro cedure is used in all of our evaluations. A Baseline for Area Weigh ted Correlation
We need a baseline to compare the values of the area weigh ted correlations of candidate indices. First we decided to look at the area weigh ted correlation of random time se-ries since this gives us a means of judging how spurious the area weigh ted correlation of a time series migh t be. The histogram of the area weigh ted correlation of 1000 random Because of space constrain ts, we mostly focus on SST, al-though some SLP results are also presen ted. As part of this discussion, we also compare poten tial climate indices deriv ed by an SVD approac h to the cluster-based indices.
We applied SNN clustering on the SST data over the time perio d from 1958 to 1998. There are 107 clusters found by SNN, as sho wn in Figure 7. Note that man y grid points from the ocean do not belong to any clusters (these are the points belonging to the white bac kground), as these points come from regions that are not relativ ely uniform and ho-mogeneous. Since we are mainly interested in nding strong candidate indices, we rst eliminate all clusters with poor area-w eigh ted correlation, i.e., below the speci ed baseline of 0 : 1. The cluster cen troids of the remaining clusters are poten tial candidate indices.

For further evaluation of the candidate indices, we divided the cluster cen troids into 4 groups, G0, G1, G2, and G3, de-pending on the correlation of the cluster cen troids to kno wn indices. Cluster cen troids (G0) that are very highly corre-lated to kno wn indices represen t a redisco very of well-kno wn indices and serv e to validate our approac h. Cluster cen troids (G1) that have a high correlation to well-kno wn indices rep-resen t varian ts of existing indices, but can be useful alterna-tives if they are better predictors of land beha vior, at least for some regions of the land. Finally , cluster cen troids (G2 and G3) with medium to low correlation may represen t po-ten tially new Earth science phenomena. These four groups of clusters are sho wn in Figures 8-11.
 Candidate Indices Similar to Kno wn Indices
Figure 8 sho ws clusters that repro duce some well-kno wn climate indices. In particular, we were able to replicate the four El Nino SST-based indices: cluster 94 corresp onds to NINO 1+2, 67 to NINO 3, 78 to NINO 3.4, and 75 to NINO 4. The correlations of these clusters to their corresp onding indices are higher than 0.9, as sho wn in the second and third columns of Table 3. In addition, cluster 67 is highly corre-lated to the CTI index, whic h is de ned over a wider area Figure 10: G2: Clusters with correlation to kno wn indices between 0.25 and 0.4.
 Figure 11: G3: Clusters with correlation to kno wn indices 0.25. for other clusters in this group.
 Candidate Indices that Ma y Represen t New Indices
The clusters that are less well correlated with kno wn in-dices (G2 and G3) may represen t new Earth science phenom-ena or weak er versions or variations of kno wn phenomena. Again, some of these cluster cen troids pro vide better `cover-age,' i.e., higher correlation, for some areas of the land. This is illustrated in Figure 13, whic h compares the El Nino in-dices to that of clusters 62 (G2). Once more, areas of yello w indicate where the cluster cen troids have higher correlation, while areas of blue indicate where the El Nino indices have higher correlation. Observ e that cluster 62 `outp erforms' the kno wn indices for some areas of the land. In con trast, clusters 4 and 5 in the group G3 deriv e most of their area weigh ted correlation from the land areas located close to the clusters. Hence, they do not app ear to represen t signi can t teleconnections.
 Figure 13: Cluster 62 vs. El Nino Indices. (Best view ed in color.) Figure 14: Area weigh ted correlation of highest SST cluster cen troids to land temp erature. the SVD comp onen t is better than the cluster based index, while for WP the rev erse is true. However, in both cases, the correlation is poor.

The best correlated SVD comp onen t for eac h well kno wn index is sho wn in the last column of Table 3. Notice that the candidate indices pro duced by clustering SST matc h the El Nino-based indices much more closely than the SVD com-ponen ts.

Finally , Table 4 compares the area weigh ted correlations of the cen troids and SVD comp onen ts chosen as most highly correlated to the kno wn indices. As can be seen, for the El Nino based indices, the area weigh ted correlations for the cluster cen troids are comparable to or better than the area weigh ted correlations for the actual indices in most cases.
Figure 16 sho ws the clusters we found for sea level pres-sure (SLP) between the time perio d of 1958 to 1998. Since pressure di erences are imp ortan t in weather and climate, negativ e correlations between pairs of clusters are also im-portan t. Indeed, most of the well-kno wn pressure-based in-dices (Table 1) are de ned as the di erence of two pressure time series. Therefore, for the SLP clusters, we generated Figure 17: Smo othed pairwise correlation of SLP clusters. (Only negativ e correlation values sho wn.) that have the strongest correlations to the resp ectiv e indices. For SOI and the El Nino based indices, the area weigh ted correlation of the cluster pair is signi can tly higher than the area weigh ted correlation of the corresp onding SVD comp o-nen t. In fact, for SOI and NINO1+2, the cluster pairs have higher area weigh ted correlations compared to their actual indices. For AO and NA O, area weigh ted correlations of SVD based indices are higher than the cluster pairs. But note that the same SVD comp onen t is chosen for both in-dices, indicating a possible mixing of the time series.
Recen tly a new index, the Indian Ocean Dip ole Mo de in-dex (DMI), has been disco vered [11]. (Because the time series for this index is shorter than other kno wn indices, we do not incorp orate this index into our analyses above.) This index is de ned as the di erence in SST anomaly be-tween the region 5 S-5 N, 55 E-75 E and the region 0 -10 S, 85 E-95 E, and is an indicator of a weak monso on over the Indian sub con tinen t and hea vy rainfall over East Africa. Figure 18 sho ws a plot of c16-c22 versus the Indian Ocean Dip ole Mo de index. Note the close connection be-tween the two time series: the correlation between them is Figure 18: Plot of c16-c22 versus the Indian Ocean Dip ole Mo de index.

In the future, we plan to extend our curren t work to ad-dress sev eral unresolv ed issues. Speci cally , we want to determine if there are any climate indices that cannot be represen ted using clusters. Also, we have also begun to in-vestigate the e ect of eliminating any correlations whose magnitudes are below a certain threshold. The idea is to eliminate noise and to see if looking only at stronger corre-lations pro duces better results. Finally , we intend to extend our analyses to other land and ocean variables and to inves-tigate ways of aggregating the data so as to mak e patterns easier to detect.
