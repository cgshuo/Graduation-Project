Our proposed ranking framework SKYRANK can be easily adapted to user-de the skyline graph. Notice that SKYRANK ranks the skyline points without requiring any user-de subspaces of the data space. For example, a user looking for a hotel may prefer to of m preferred subspaces PRF ={ U 1 , ... , U m }, with U vertices, which in our setting correspond to skyline points. Let us assume a skyline graph G that correspond to the skyline points SKY . The i -th element of the personalization vector u jump chooses the i -th vertex p i . If the personalization value is set to u vertex. Notice that  X  i =1 | SKY | u i =1. In the following, we demonstrate how to de to favor skyline points of preferred subspaces.

Given a set of preferences PRF ={ U 1 , ... , U m } where U points of the graph, we set the values of the personalization vector in such a way that for each preferred subspace U  X  vector u j is increased by 1 m  X  j SKY preferred subspaces.
