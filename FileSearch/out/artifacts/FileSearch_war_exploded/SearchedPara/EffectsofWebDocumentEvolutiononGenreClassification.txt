 The World Wide Web is a massiv e corpus that constan tly evolves. Classi cation exp erimen ts usually grab a snapshot (temp orally and spatially) of the Web for a corpus. In this pap er, we examine the e ects of page evolution on genre classi cation of Web pages. Web genr e refers to the type of the page characterized by features suc h as style, form or presen tation layout, and meta-con ten t; Web genre can be used to tune spider crawling re-visits and inform relev ance judgmen ts for searc h engines. We found that pages in some genres change rarely if at all and can be used in presen t-da y researc h exp erimen ts without requiring an updated version. We sho w that an old corpus can be used for training when testing on new Web pages, with only a marginal drop in accuracy rates on genre classi cation. We also sho w that features found to be useful in one corpus do not transfer well to other corp ora with di eren t genres.
 H.3.3 [ Information Searc h and Retriev al ]: Retriev al mo dels Exp erimen tation Genre, text classi cation, corp ora
Web page genre is a relativ ely untapp ed source of searc h information. Standard topic queries can be enhanced by specifying page genre. Instructors may look for pages with good questions or tutorials for their studen ts. Academics may want scholarly articles on some topic. Shopp ers may want reviews about speci c pro ducts.

Additionally , genre may inform how often pages must be revisited by spiders. Cho and Garcia-Molina [3] estimated that 50% of the Web changes every 50 days. However, the distribution of change is domain dep enden t { with appro xi-mately 40% change every day in .com sites and only 1 to 2% in .edu and .gov sites [3]. This a ects the eciency of spider crawls for searc h engines. Systems trade o between crawl-ing new areas on the Web and revisiting pages that have already been crawled to incorp orate changes in the page. Kno wing the genre of a Web page (through automated clas-si cation) may help determine whether the page is likely to change over time, and to what degree.

Studies of Web genre have focused on iden tifying the types of genres that are useful for the Web and the techniques for automated classi cation of genre (e.g., [5, 4, 7, 9]). In eac h case, the authors collect Web page examples of eac h of their genres in a corpus; the corpus is analyzed and used for evaluating classi cation. The rate of change in the Web calls into question whether conclusions dra wn from these corp ora are likely to be valid in the future or whether the corp ora migh t be e ectiv ely used to evaluate subsequen t researc h.
In this pap er, we presen t an analysis of two corp ora for genre classi cation of Web pages. Because of the adv antages of having commonly accepted corp ora to supp ort evaluation and the possible utilit y of genre classi cation for tuning Web spider revisits, we focus primarily on analyzing the e ect of the passage of time on classi cation. We seek to answ er the follo wing three questions: 1. How much do Web pages change over time within eac h 2. Can we e ectiv ely train a genre classi er on an old 3. How well do the features selected based on a corpus
The con tribution of this pap er is an in-depth analysis of two corp ora used previously in genre classi cation. We ob-tained versions of the pages in the corp ora from speci c dates (via a Web archiv e) and analyzed the evolution of doc-umen ts within eac h genre, the use of old corp ora for train-ing and testing on new pages for genre classi cation, and the ecacy of feature transfer between corp ora for genre classi cation.

We found that the rate of change of Web pages does indeed vary between genres, whic h supp orts genre use for optimiz-ing spiders. We also found that, to a large exten t, classi -cation transfers from old to new corp ora, thus supp orting con tinued use of old corp ora in evaluation exp erimen ts and in classi cation of genres, but that, not surprisingly , infor-mativ e features are speci c to the genre set, suggesting that new corp ora need to be dev elop ed to supp ort extended genre sets. Studies of Web genre have used six corp ora, as listed in Table 1. Four of the six corp ora are considered to be old, meaning the pages were downloaded before 2000. Tw o cor-pora were iden ti ed as recen t, downloaded in 2003/2004. The WebKb corpus [4] is freely available on the Internet at the CMU website. The three other old corp ora are no longer available according to the authors. Cro wston and Williams [6] published a list of the URLs used for their FAQ corpus, whic h allo ws it to be reconstructed, but it only con tained one genre. The Mey er zu Eissen corpus was e-mailed to us by the authors. The Boese corpus was available as well, but we could not nd enough old versions of its pages to supp ort our retrosp ectiv e study .
According to the headers of the WebKb corpus les, the dataset was downloaded in Nov/Dec of 1996 [4]. It con tains 4,518 Web pages classi ed to one of six genres commonly found on computer science departmen t websites (course, de-partmen t, facult y homepage, pro ject, sta homepage and studen t homepage) and an other category con taining 3,764 Web pages. Eac h genre con tains a set of pages from four uni-versities (Cornell, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin) and a set from various univ ersities.

The original WebKb corpus con tains man y empt y Web page les and error messages, whic h were remo ved. The WebKb corpus also con tained a few incorrectly formatted pages, including one page with the le:// proto col, four pages with the ftp:// proto col, and three pages without the full URL. We also remo ved all pages in the other category . After pruning errors and pages with Flash or HTML frames, the WebKb corpus sized down from 4,518 to 4,249 pages.
Classi cation exp erimen ts on WebKb have been done us-ing three of the univ ersit y sets in conjunction with the set from various univ ersities for training, and testing on the held-out univ ersit y set [4]. Because of the low num bers of departmen t and sta pages, most exp erimen ts follo wing the held-out univ ersit y test set pro cedure had to classify based only on the four other genres.

We adopted a di eren t metho dology for classi cation; we use only one page from eac h Internet address 1 and classify on selections from ve of the genres (sta still does not con-tain enough pages). By limiting the num ber of pages from the same Internet address within a genre, we prev ent bias towards a particular univ ersit y's style of pages or rep etition of words.
Mey er zu Eissen and Stein [9] dev elop ed a corpus of 1,209 pages across 8 genres. They selected genres based on a user 1 An Internet address example would be \cs.colostate.edu", as opp osed to the domain name whic h is \colostate.edu". study to determine the most useful genres according to stu-den ts who use searc h engines.

We cleaned the corpus follo wing the pro cedures listed pre-viously . We also ensured unique Internet addresses within eac h genre, but this wasn't really an issue in this corpus. We decided to remo ve the \discussion" genre when we found only one discussion page available from 1999 (see next sec-tion for details of aging).
Our exp erimen ts are designed to assess the e ects of page evolution on genre classi cation. To con trol for the di er-ences in when the corp ora were downloaded, we used 1999 and 2005 as our benc hmark years for analysis. We selected the most recen t 1999 version available through the Internet Arc hiv e website (www.arc hiv e.org) and downloaded all new versions in April of 2005. This allo wed us to see the amoun t of change across corp ora over an equal time frame.
To obtain 1999 versions of the Web pages for both corp ora, we used the Internet Arc hiv e website. Since 1996, the Inter-net Arc hiv e has been building an 'Internet Library' of on-line digital documen ts. For Web pages, the Internet Arc hiv e also main tains copies of the pages after updates through time. Not all Web pages are accessible through the archiv e, due to rob ots.txt exclusions, JavaScript issues, serv er-side image maps and pages not crawled by Alexa Internet. Therefore, no claims can be made concerning the exact origination date of a page, nor the accessibilit y of a page at a point in time before the rst entry of the page in the archiv e.
To create a recen t version of eac h corpus, we downloaded eac h URL in April 2005. We used a 30 second time-out pe-riod for downloading. We recorded the HTTP status codes and last mo di cation dates of eac h page, if available. How-ever, custom error pages designate a HTTP serv er resp onse of 200 \OK", but the actual Web page returned was an error page. These are considered to be 'soft-errors' because a Web page is deliv ered instead of an HTTP error status code.
We cleaned eac h corpus by remo ving all empt y pages, serv er-customized error pages (e.g., 'soft-404', permission and serv er errors), dynamic pages (e.g., documen t.write scripts), ftp pages (uses the ftp:// proto col) and re-directs (e.g., \per-manen tly moved" and HTTP refresh meta-tags under 30 seconds). One page that used the redirect meta-tag was kept in the corpus, because it app eared to be a legitimate news refresh of the page. Pages with frames and Flash programs were also remo ved, since the focus this of researc h is text and HTML classi cation, not multi-media and multi-page anal-ysis. In the pro cess of cleaning the corp ora, we disco vered that most pages under 500 bytes were errors and pages under 1KB were either custom error messages or pages with very low information con ten t. Fletc her found that Web pages un-der 5KB and over 200KB had a lower signal to noise ratio [8]. The only exception we found was the personal home-page, where a legitimate Web page may simply con tain the person's name and con tact information.

Table 2 sho ws the distribution of Web pages and the num-ber of unique Internet addresses across genres for both the old and new corp ora for WebKb. The list of URLs used for both the old and new WebKb corp ora are available at: http://www.cs.colostate.edu/ ~ boese/Resea rch/Co rpora. html. For the Mey er zu Eissen's corpus, our pro cess resulted in downloading 327 pages from 1999 and 761 pages from 2005. recen t Mey er zu Eissen and Stein (2004) 8 1,209 Jan '04 From authors within the Internet Arc hiv e in 1999 or earlier.
Exploitation of genre requires automated classi cation of documen ts. For classi cation, documen ts are represen ted as sets of features. Web page features can be deriv ed from three overlapping categories: style, form and con ten t [1]. These three categories encompass the categories previously iden ti ed by Web genre researc hers. We used the follo wing feature types in our exp erimen ts: Style Form Con ten t A general description of eac h category and its feature sets are pro vided below. A full list of the features used in our exp erimen ts is available at: http://www.cs.colostate.edu/ ~ boese/Rese arch/C orp ora .html. Style refers to the structure and readabilit y of the page. Style features include: readabilit y scales (e.g., Flesh Index score), sen tence information (e.g., use of questions, passiv e sen tences), word usage (e.g., use of conjunctions, pronouns) and sen tence beginnings (e.g., prep ositions, articles). A to-tal of 45 style features were used in our exp erimen ts, deriv ed from the output of the UNIX style program.

The form of a Web page consists of the presen tation lay-out or format of the page. It includes text statistics (e.g., # of paragraphs) and HTML analysis (e.g., emphasis tags, im-ages, links). We analyzed 42 features related to form, some of whic h overlap with the style and con ten t feature sets.
The content is comp osed predominately of term frequency coun ts (or binary coun ts or normalized percen tages) of terms that app ear in the page. A term is a group of characters sep-arated by white-space or other non-alpha-n umeric sym bols. Binary coun t main tains either a zero for terms that do not app ear or a one for terms that do app ear in the page. Ex-amples of non-alphab etic terms are phone num bers, dates and times, other numerical values, sym bols and closed-w ord sets.

Closed-w ord sets are word groups that have a nite (usu-ally small) num ber of related terms. For example, we ana-lyzed the mon ths of the year, days of the week, salutations and seasons.

We also analyzed punctuation, num ber of emphasized terms, terms found in the HTML title tag com bined with terms from the URL, and num bers of particular HTML tags to determine presen tation con ten t suc h as the num ber of im-ages and tables on the page. Emphasized terms are those speci ed in bold, headings, and/or italics as speci ed by HTML tags. We applied a Porter Stemmer to the words in the page and the title and URL words [11].

Our list of features is not exhaustiv e; there are other fea-tures commonly used in genre classi cation researc h suc h as: part-of-sp eech tagging [2], stop-w ord lists for term reduc-tion and link text analysis [1, 4]. Although part-of-sp eech tagging has been found to be successful for genre classi -cation, it is computationally more exp ensiv e than simple binary coun ts of term frequency . We used a subset of POS statistics for determining the style features of the page.
Use of stop-w ord lists have been used to reduce the fea-ture space. Stop-w ord lists range from 100 to over a thou-sand words. However, some studies of genre classi cation Figure 1: The accessibilit y of pages for the WebKb and Mey er zu Eissen corp ora. Percen tages are ex-pressed with resp ect to the num ber of URLs listed in the original corpus. have found stop words to be imp ortan t for distinguishing between genres [10, 12]. For example, Nigam et al. (2000) found the word \my" to be very helpful in discriminating the personal homepage, based on Web pages available in 1999. We therefore analyzed the use of stop-w ords to help determine the style of the Web page text.
 Link text is the text app earing in an HTML href tag. In our previous researc h [1], we achiev ed high classi cation accuracy by com bining as a feature the text from a link pointing to a Web page with the text from the HTML title tag and URL comp onen ts of the page. In this pap er, we only considered the com bination of the title text with the URL comp onen ts. We could not use the link text information because it was una vailable for the Mey er zu Eissen corpus. For future work, we intend to investigate gathering link text information for all the corp ora we have compiled. We address three issues concerning the e ect of time on Web pages with resp ect to genre: the degree of evolution of Web pages, whether we can use old corp ora on new pages for genre classi cation, and whether selected features from one corpus could be transferred to another corpus with di eren t genres.
We chose to look at three measuremen ts of change: the accessibility of the pages today, the last modi c ation dates of pages accessed in 2005, and the degree of page simi-larity from 1999 and 2005 using the cosine metric. These measuremen ts become increasingly complicated and infor-mativ e. The rst simply chec ks existence of the page, the second considers the amoun t of time between changes, and the third assesses how much the page changes with resp ect to genre. The follo wing three subsections describ e these in turn.
The base measure of change is the persistence of the URL, i.e., whether the page is even available at di eren t points in time. Figure 1 sho ws the accessibilit y of URLs for the WebKb and Mey er zu Eissen corp ora in 1999 and 2005.
For the WebKb corpus, while 82% of the pages originally downloaded in 1996 were still available in 1999, the percen t-age had dropp ed to 42% by 2005. Persistence varied across genre. A chi-square test comparing num ber of documen ts found in the original corpus versus num ber found in 2005 was highly signi can t ( 2 = 213 : 59, p &lt; : 0001), suggesting that accessibilit y is dep enden t on genre. Speci cally , only 54% of the URLs from the course genre were still accessible in 1999 (via Internet Arc hiv e), where the other genres were all between 70% and 80%. Man y of the genre di erences are not surprising. For example, man y course URLs con tain the semester and/or year of the course -whic h is no longer salien t after the course nishes. The studen t genre had the largest drop of 50%, whic h re ects the fact that studen ts are exp ected to graduate and move on; therefore, the stu-den t homepage genre should have a high turn-o ver rate. The departmen t genre had the least drop in accessibilit y between 1999 and 2005, whic h is also exp ected. The errors on most the departmen t Web pages were due to a change of Internet address for the URL.

For the Mey er zu Eissen corpus, the trends are similar if somewhat more pronounced: the further from the original date, the lower is accessibilit y. Mey er zu Eissen was cre-ated in 2004. Thus, 1999 is a retrosp ectiv e look; in 1999, only 406 (or 33%) of the URLS already existed. Giv en the massiv e expansion of the Web in the interv ening years, it is hardly surprising that the sampling from 2004 would have a higher represen tation of new pages. In 2005, a year after its creation, most of the pages (63%) still existed.
Accessibilit y indicates how useful a corpus is for evalua-tion and training of classi ers. Additionally , crawlers can tailor their e ort based on whic h types of pages previously indexed are more likely to still be accessible and whic h pages may no longer be accessible. If the crawler kno ws a page is from a genre with a high turn-o ver rate, it can visit the page more often to verify its existence or remo ve it from the index. This could be used to prev ent searc h engines from rep orting relev ant Web pages that no longer exist.
As with accessibilit y, last mo di cation date pro vides a crude estimate of change { just when rather than how much. To assess rate of change, we queried eac h URL for its last mo di cation date. Not all HTTP heading requests resp ond with a last mo di ed date; we recorded as man y as we could get, as indicated in the last section.

We found that some genres haven't changed in years and others have a tendency to change more frequen tly. A chi-square of last mo di cation year by genre sho ws that the date is statistically signi can tly dep enden t on genre ( 2 = 103 : 2 ; p &lt; : 0001 for WebKb and 2 = 192 : 8 ; p &lt; : 0001 for Mey er zu Eissen).

Figure 2 sho ws a plot of last mo di cation year for a sub-set of genres from the WebKb and Mey er zu Eissen corp ora. The articles genre was selected to sho w that most of the articles do not change once published on the Web. Discus-sion Web pages tend to con tain threads of messages that are updated as new posts are made. Faculty falls in be-tween in frequency of updating. The di erence in change date should be roughly predictable from a mo del of these observ ed changes dates per genre. Figure 2: Last mo di ed dates on three genres from WebKb and Mey er zu Eissen corp ora.
The third exp erimen t analyzed the similarit y of pages within genres over time. We used the well kno wn cosine similarit y metric: where o is the feature vector for 1999 pages and n is the fea-ture vector for 2005 pages. This can be used to determine how much change occurs in pages within a particular genr e . The cosine measure is useful because it can scale to any num ber of dimensions and normalizes the feature space for more ecien t pro cessing. Table 3 displa ys the cosine simi-larit y metrics for the WebKb corpus and sho ws that within a genre similarit y is high, suggesting that most pages within a genre do not change a great deal over time.
 Table 3: Cosine values comparing 1999 and 2005 versions of WebKb pages.
Genre can enhance Web searc h or help tune the perfor-mance of Web spiders. Neither role can be accomplished unless genre can be automatically detected. In this section, we consider two related issues: Can an old corpus be used to train and test new pages? Are the features iden ti ed from an old corpus still informativ e for new data?
As a baseline, we trained and tested on the 2005 corp ora using strati ed 10-fold cross-v alidation. We used WEKA's LogitBo ost algorithm for classi cation [13]. Classi cation resulted in 79.6% and 74.8% accuracy on average for WebKb and Mey er zu Eissen resp ectiv ely, with a lot of variabilit y across the genres as sho wn in Tables 4 and 5.

For WebKb, studen t homepages were most dicult to classify accurately . Most of the mis-classi ed studen t pages were classi ed to the facult y genre. We hypothesized that this could be partially due to the lack of pages in the stu-den t genre. To test this hypothesis, we tested classi cation accuracy when limiting eac h genre to only 31 pages, and obtained an average classi cation accuracy of 65%. The next step was to look at the new Web pages for studen ts. Out of the 31 used in the classi cation exp erimen ts, 14 of them stated the studen t was curren tly a professor or re-searc her somewhere else, listed their publications and in-dicated when/where they nished their Ph.D. Man y fac-ulty pages con tain similar information. Consequen tly, more careful classi cation or de nition will be needed for studen t pages. An additional ve con tained low information con ten t and should have been remo ved (no text, directory listing and serv er error message). The confusion sho ws that some pages may need to evolve (switc h genres) as their owners switc h their status.

We also trained classi ers on the 1999 corp ora and tested them on the 2005 corp ora to determine whether classi ers can be exp ected to con tinue to be accurate. We achiev ed an accuracy of 76.3% (as sho wn in Table 6), whic h is only sligh tly lower than the 79.6% using just the new corpus. Ta-ble 7 sho ws a similar e ect on the Mey er zu Eissen corpus. Tables 8 and 9 summarize classi cation results for sev eral variations on the corp ora. Although the acurracy rates are similar for all versions of the Mey er zu Eissen corpus, the true positiv e percen tages for eac h genre varied across train-ing and test sets. We found that the num ber of documen ts used in training partially a ected these results.
Automated genre classi cation dep ends on iden tifying salien t features. In this analysis, we looked at whic h features were most informativ e at di eren t points in time and assessed whether features con tinued to be informativ e over time.
As our rst pass at the analysis, we used all the terms found for the page's feature vector. However, we found this caused some over-tting, where terms suc h as a particular univ ersit y's name would app ear after feature selection meth-ods were emplo yed. Because of this, we performed an initial feature selection based on thresholding. Terms had to ap-pear in at least 10% of the pages within a genre to qualify for our feature vectors. This was still problematic when the num ber of pages within a genre were less than 30; so we also required a minim um of 3 for the thresholding.

We analyzed the features found at the two time points under our thresholding and under feature selection as in the WEKA pac kage. Tables 10 and 11 sho w the total num bers of features found at the two points in time under our thresh-olding and feature selection, the percen tage of features that were common to both time perio ds, and the classi cation rates given all features or just the features that were com-mon to both time perio ds. The relativ ely high rate of clas-si cation given the common features suggests that genre as de ned by automated classi cation is quite stable over a six year perio d.
To assess the usage of corp ora for evaluation, we also examined whether there was any commonalit y of features across corp ora. We looked at the features chosen by fea-Boost. using LogitBo ost. ture selection for the WebKb and Mey er zu Eissen corp ora. We iden ti ed the common features for eac h corp ora based on the features chosen during feature selection for both the 1999 and 2005 corp ora. We found 33 features common to the old and new WebKb corp ora, and 19 features common to the old and new Mey er zu Eissen corp ora. Table 12 sho ws the common features in both corp ora; only one feature over-lapp ed between the two corp ora with di eren t genres. Note that most features are from BO W.
 Table 12: Common features selected using WEKA's Correlation-based Feature Subset Selection algo-rithm. Terms listed are found in both the 1999 and 2005 subsets for the corpus. TU = word app earing in either the HTML title tag or the URL (or both).
A closer look at the data sho ws, not surprisingly , that the BO W terms are not transferable. However, the style readabilit y metrics are all somewhat similar, and the fact that both WebKb and Mey er zu Eissen corp ora selected a readabilit y measure and num ber of links could be consid-ered transferable. Additionally , the num ber of table tags (selected in WebKb) and the num ber of tr tags designating a table row within a table (selected in Mey er zu Eissen cor-pus) are fairly similar as well. Predominately , however, the features required for genre classi cation tend to be domain speci c.
In this pro ject, we have looked at primarily temp oral fac-tors that a ect the value of corp ora for genre classi cation. In future work, we intend to expand our analysis to further iden tify critical factors that should be accoun ted for in the construction of corp ora. For example, man y other features may be salien t as in [1], as well as additional closed-w ord sets suc h as \Ph.D." and \M.S.".

Feature selection and thresholding clearly exert an in u-ence and should be further explored. Although we found 5% too small for thresholding, 10% was chosen but problematic on small corp ora. A form ula is needed that appropriately thresholds features selected based on the size of the corpus. Another issue concerns whic h pages should be disregarded. At presen t, we considered discarding pages under a partic-ular size. However, for an expanded genre set suc h thresh-olding may be inappropriate.

Finally , the genre corp ora include a restricted set of gen-res, pages and judgmen ts about what constitutes a genre. We intend to dev elop a larger corpus with a wider set of genres and test the sub jectivit y of the assignmen t of genres to pages. This migh t also permit assigning a single page to multiple genres. Thresholding 627 737 555 88.6% 75.3% 75.7% 71.4% 70.2% Feature selection 53 63 33 75.0% 52.4% 79.1% 79.6% 74.5% Thresholding 5,156 4,456 3,975 77.0% 89.3% 69.7% 73.3% 71.7% Feature selection 51 53 19 36.5% 35.2% 69.6% 74.8% 73.3%
Genre classi cation of Web pages is still a relativ ely new and unexplored domain. Genre kno wledge can be used for impro ving the eciency of a spider updating its kno wledge base and for query relev ance in searc h engines.
Genre classi cation of Web pages dep ends on how the corpus is organized. Using unique Internet addresses within eac h genre can help prev ent bias towards particular website styles, and testing should be done on Internet addresses that have not yet been seen by the classi er. Prop er threshold-ing for feature selection is required to prev ent over-tting. Classifying very small les with little information con ten t (e.g., links and images only) is dicult and may not achiev e the desired goals of relev ance to users' information needs.
We sho wed how one genre could evolve over time to an-other genre (studen t to facult y homepage). One speci c metric isn't enough for validation; for example, studen ts who become facult y mem bers have a high cosine similar-ity between old and new versions of a Web page yet they'v e evolved into a di eren t genre.

Predominately , the features required for genre classi ca-tion tend to be domain speci c. This is problematic for attempting to use the features from one corpus in other cor-pora.

Most imp ortan tly, we have demonstrated that although the Web, in general, changes rapidly , the de nition of genre, as manifest in classi ers, app ears remark ably stable. Genre can be used for both tuning spiders and for enhancing searc h. Conclusions dra wn from evaluation on old corp ora are likely still to hold. Classi ers trained on old documen ts in corp ora still work well on updated versions of the pages.
