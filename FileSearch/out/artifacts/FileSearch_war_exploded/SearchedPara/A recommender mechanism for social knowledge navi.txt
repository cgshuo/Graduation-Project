 1. Introduction
People exchange information and experiences to generate and enrich their personal knowledge. Knowledge is important recent years, Web 2.0 applications and social media have provided a convenient environment for people to share their per-sonal knowledge on the Internet. Many people and enterprises also enrich their own knowledge by means of this convenient environment ( Cole, 2008 ).
 Online collaborative encyclopedias are one of the most famous Web 2.0 applications for knowledge sharing ( Leshed, Haber, cles are of good quality ( Giacomo, 2008 ). The shared content is also a good resource for knowledge learning.
There are many online encyclopedias that provide a lot of knowledge, and people seek new knowledge from them every 2012 ), surpassing Chinese Wikipedia in this respect. Hudong is the largest Chinese encyclopedia, news, and neologism  X  importance of online encyclopedias for seeking and sharing knowledge.

Online collaborative encyclopedias still have several weaknesses, however, in terms of seeking and reusing knowledge resources, and many researchers have identified the disadvantages of online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia ( Wu &amp; Wu, 2011 ). For example, there are several questions which users ask, such as  X  X  X hich article is important and worth reading? X  X   X  X  X hat is the concept in related articles? X  X   X  X  X ow can I get comprehensive understanding of new knowledge by reading just a few articles? X  X  Lacking a practical way to reduce these disadvantages and improve performance, the results would be a waste of time and information overload. As a result, a recommender mechanism of social knowledge navigation which can support people to reuse the huge volume of available knowledge urgently needs to be established.
In order to solve the above problems, this research proposes a novel social knowledge navigation system (SKNS) to sup-port users in knowledge navigation of online free encyclopedias. This study proposes an innovative recommender mecha-nism of knowledge visualization and navigation which would contains related knowledge findings, judges the importance of knowledge, and offers a visualized knowledge navigation interface. It would construct a more comprehensive view of the knowledge map and highlight the important knowledge flows so people could find knowledge information efficiently.
In the proposed system, a knowledge seeker could key in a word and the system would help to find the specific knowledge information required. If the query results were not in accordance with the users X  requirements, then the system would gen-erate sub-concepts as suggestions which would direct the user to search again.
 the research topic. Section 3 details the social knowledge navigation recommendation system, which is combined with rel-evant knowledge network construction, knowledge importance analysis, knowledge concept ontology construction, and a prehensive experiment results and evaluations. Section 6 concludes and suggests future research directions. 2. Related literature 2.1. Social media and social knowledge
In recent years, in the light of emerging trends and the growing popularity of social media, researchers have attempted to analyze the characteristics and enhance the practical uses of social media. Social media gives researchers an unprecedented ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content X  X  ( Kaplan &amp; Haenlein, 2010 ). The information created on the social media platforms can be divided into two categories; user-generated content and non-content information (for example the links between articles and user feedback ratings) Wikipedia is a form of output of social knowledge; it is a product generated from the wisdom of the crowd. Cheong and
Choudhury et al. (2008) analyze the communication dynamics of blogs and use it to determine correlations with stock mar-ket movements. Stein and Maier (1995) discuss how to use online forums as a powerful tool for problem solving.
The present research considers that social knowledge is not only a good resource for problem solving or decision-making, but that it also helps people to seek and learn new knowledge. Therefore, this study aims to improve learning effectiveness by utilizing the power of social knowledge in online encyclopedias. 2.2. Knowledge relevance and analysis of importance
In today X  X  network environment, a huge amount of user-generated content and non-content information is created on tify high quality of information is an important. Traditionally, information retrieval (IR) techniques were used to improve search performance. Recently, network structure mining techniques, such as link mining, have been successfully used with (2010) propose a context-aware citation recommendation system for finding high-quality citation articles. Social network analysis (SNA) pays attention to the relationships between interactive social entities. Graph theory, theoretical concepts movies, hotels, etc.). Agichtein et al. (2008) explores methods of using community feedback (ratings) to automatically rec-ognize essential and high-quality content. Social rating systems are increasing in popularity among commercial sites (e.g. Digg.com, Amazon.com and Netfix.com).

In our work, social rating theory is used as a theoretical foundation for social interaction (SI), and we use social rating mechanisms to evaluate which articles are worthy to read and learn in the knowledge network. The importance of social interaction (feedback rating) is measured by counting the views of the crowd and the experts.

One of the most common approaches used to find the similarity between two Web contents is a text mining approach quantifying similarity between different objects and text documents can be used in many different modules and Web appli-comparison of collocation-based similarity approaches to determine extra search terms support query expansion; Yuan and
Sun (2005) present a structured cosine similarity (SCS) method for document summarization; Singh, Krishna, and Saxena (2009) propose an augmented Jaccard similarity function for the preservation of privacy.

This research considers and integrates the methods of the above studies in order to construct a comprehensive method for analyzing knowledge relevance and importance, and aims to provide important and relevant knowledge articles for knowledge seekers. 2.3. Knowledge maps and knowledge flow
Knowledge visualization investigates ways of using visual illustrations to enhance knowledge sharing between two peo-problems of overload, misinterpretation, and misuse.

A knowledge map is one of the methods used in knowledge visualization, and can be defined as  X  X  X  tool or technique that enables visualizing knowledge and relationship in a clear form via a way so that the relevant features of the knowledge can et al. X  X  (2005) research, text mining and SOM categorization are used to construct a knowledge map for reducing the infor-mation overload on online news websites. Wang, Su, and Hsieh (2011) propose an implicit knowledge extraction mechanism to build a knowledge map in order to carry out more effective assessments. Other research summarizes the advantages and information than hierarchical displays.

A Knowledge flow fulfills people X  X  knowledge requirements and the referencing of the order of articles about the tasks ing mechanism X  X  ( Zhuge, 2002 ). It can offer task-related knowledge to help meet people X  X  knowledge demands quickly and
Therefore, in order to avoid the information overload problem inherent in seeking new knowledge on online encyclopedia platforms, this study uses knowledge visualization to reduce it, and chooses a map display format for the visualization of knowledge articles. It also uses knowledge flow to help knowledge seekers view necessary knowledge effectively. If suffi-ciently supported by the information displayed on the knowledge map and a knowledge flow, people can seek new knowl-edge effectively. 3. The system framework
A framework of the proposed social knowledge navigation mechanism used in online encyclopedias is designed and presented in this section. Fig. 1 depicts the main components and procedures of the proposed social knowledge navigation system (SKNS) architecture, which includes four main modules.

The first component is a relevant knowledge network construction module; the aim of this component is to collect rel-evant articles from the online encyclopedia platform. The second component is a knowledge importance analysis module; the purpose of this component is to evaluate which articles are worth reading. The third component is a knowledge concept ontology construction module; it is used to find and construct sub-concepts contained inside special knowledge. The last component is a knowledge visualization and navigation interface. With this component, the study can help knowledge seek-ers to understand the information and knowledge in the knowledge network effectively. 3.1. Relevant knowledge network construction module
The aim of this module is to collect relevant articles from online encyclopedia platforms. In order to discover and learn new knowledge from online encyclopedia platforms, this system gathers relevant articles and filters out unrelated articles.
The processes of the module can be divided into two steps. 3.1.1. Knowledge network construction
The first step is to construct the knowledge network, which includes articles relevant to the knowledge the users want to learn. This study uses the keyword as the input from a knowledge seeker, and regards it as the seeking target. The keyword search is one of the most common methods used to explore unknown knowledge, and the keyword search function is provided on almost all of the online encyclopedia platforms. Therefore, this study uses the keyword input as a knowledge seeker X  X  seeking target, and uses it to find the start page of the knowledge article.

Almost all of the knowledge article pages contain internal hyperlinks, and a huge amount of reference and extension information can be obtained by accessing them. The internal hyperlinks may include sources about further readings related which are closely related to the learning object of users. In this knowledge network, each article page is represented by a node and each internal hyperlink is represented as an edge. The knowledge network is constructed by expanding the hyper-links and including the referenced articles recursively. 3.1.2. Knowledge relevance evaluation
The purpose of this step is to identify which articles included in the constructed knowledge network are highly relevant to the seeking target of a knowledge seeker. When a knowledge seeker wants to learn new knowledge on the encyclopedia plat-form, he/she is only interested in the articles matching his/her seeking target. To achieve this purpose, the technique of the knowledge network. The formula of cosine similarity score is calculated as: object of the knowledge seeker. 3.2. Knowledge importance analysis module
The purpose of the knowledge importance module is to find the articles which are worth reading and learn from the con-
The importance of social structure is evaluated according to the node X  X  importance in the network structure. 3.2.1. Social interaction analysis
The importance of social interaction (SI) includes two parts, crowd rating (CR) and expert rating (ER), which stand for the clopedia platform. The formula of CR i is written as: indicates the greater value of knowledge article i which the general users perceive.

The encyclopedia platform can also recruit knowledgeable people as experts to rate the articles, so this study provides ER as the expert rating for a typical article i . The formula of ER where er k i is the article i  X  X  average score of experts X  feedback on metric k .

Combining the crowd and expert ratings measured above, the knowledge importance for article i , evaluated from the social interactions SI i , can be formulated as: where w r is the weight of CR i , and (1 w r ) is the weight of ER 3.2.2. Network structure analysis
We can further measure the importance of an article from the aspect of knowledge network structure. This research con-used in Wu and Wu X  X  (2011) study. The formula of structure strength ( SS ) for article i is represented as: where KN is the set of the articles included in the knowledge network and w between article i and the other articles in this knowledge network. H articles inside this knowledge network, the study considers the degree centrality of each node. Let U further score aggregation.

Next, if articles i and j have a higher common in-links and out-links, the tie strength of relationship between them is stronger. A common in-link means two articles have the same source or reference information; conversely, a common out-link means they are used in the same application or method. The tie strength of the relationship between articles i and j is measured as: mulated as: 3.3. Knowledge concept ontology construction module
The knowledge concept ontology construction module is developed to extract the sub-concepts and their relationship from the constructed knowledge network according to the user X  X  seeking target. Ontology is a structured knowledge base denotes a ontology, where NC is a set of knowledge concepts and R is the parent-child relation between two different knowl-of concepts a typical article i involves can be expressed as: The set of aggregated concepts extracted from the knowledge network can be written as:
To construct this parent-child relation from the extracted concepts, this study uses the platform X  X  category and sub-cat-which a circle represents a unique concept, and the link represents their parent-child relationship. For example, c ent relationship with c 1 ; on the contrary, c 1 has a child relationship with c
The construction process of the knowledge concept is illustrated by the following example. Assume a user wants to seek ship is built between c 2 (category: social network) and c 3.3.1. Sub-concept finding
The aim of sub-concept finding is to construct the knowledge map satisfying the seeking target. The main steps needed for the sub-concept finding are as follows. The first step is to map the concepts of each article to the knowledge concept ontology. The second step is to calculate each article X  X  concept score by the concepts it has.

The knowledge concept ontology is the forest-like structure in the encyclopedia platform. Each root of a tree in the forest represents a main sub-concept. The score of a sub-concept equals the number of nodes included in the path from article node regarded as this article X  X  sub-concepts. For instance, there are two main sub-concepts  X  X  X ocial network X  X  (node c the only category labels contained in the  X  X  X ocial network analysis X  X  article (node c c ). The score of the main sub-concepts (c 3 ,c 4 ) with respect to c concept of the  X  X  X ocial network analysis X  X  article is node c article is node c 3 ( X  X  X ocial network X  X ) and node c 4 ( X  X  X ocial networking service X  X ).
 3.4. Knowledge visualization and navigation interface
In order to let knowledge seekers understand the information in the knowledge network effectively, this study builds a visualized social knowledge map and navigation interface with NodeXL, which provides a Microsoft Excel 2007 and 2010 reading sequences for knowledge seekers. The following paragraphs describe how to build the knowledge map and reading sequence. 3.4.1. Knowledge map generation
This study uses a knowledge map to help users to understand the overall relationships and sub-concepts of target knowl-edge. The knowledge map is generated in the following steps. According to the knowledge concept ontology, we map the sub-concepts of each article in the knowledge network. Then, these sub-concepts corresponding to the article on the knowl-edge network are expressed by different symbols and colors. The knowledge map with the sub-concepts is shown by
NodeXL. In this step, a knowledge seeker can see the sub-concept information related to the seeking target, such as  X  X  X hat are the main sub-concepts of this special knowledge? X  X  With the support of this knowledge map, knowledge seekers can understand new knowledge effectively. 3.4.2. Knowledge flow recommendation
In order to help knowledge seekers to learn the new knowledge effectively, a knowledge flow recommendation is gener-ated for the seeking target. The knowledge flow recommendation is a reading path highlighted by the knowledge map. An this proposed system only recommends a few articles. Then, the system uses the evaluated knowledge importance, the arti-cle node X  X  link, and the knowledge concept ontology to build the sequence in the following steps.

First, we use the keyword X  X  article node as the start node and locate the position of the keyword node X  X  concepts in the the following two conditions must be met: the candidate nodes should be among the top five in terms of knowledge impor-didate node with the maximum number of related concepts is selected as the first cause node. The out-linked candidate node with the maximum number of related concepts is selected as the first effect node. By repeating the above rules, we can fur-the reading sequence. 4. Experiments
Our proposed framework is implemented and validated on a famous online encyclopedia platform, Wikipedia, which is a knowledge-sharing website. Wikipedia provides a huge amount of knowledge article resources supplied by countless volun-of this site X  X  visitors are from the USA, and Wikipedia X  X  audiences are often users who browse at work and school ( Alexa, 2012b ). We use Java and NodeXL to develop a Wikipedia application called SKNS (social knowledge navigation system).
The detailed data analysis and experimental procedures are described as follows. 4.1. Data description
These three keywords represent relative but different academic fields. This research invited people who have used the Eng-with these seeking targets. In May 2012, 94 users (35% male, 65% female) participated in our experiment on the seeking tar-work X  X  as an example to describe how to implement this system on Wikipedia. The participants are asked to join quiz and self-evaluation with two different systems (basic Wikipedia vs. SKNS) for assessing learning performance and use the five-point Likert scale to verify the recommendation of knowledge flow on learning performance.

Human experts are invited to evaluate the relevance between the recommendation articles and the recommendation and 30 graduated students major in MIS or Marketing is formed to judge whether an recommender article is related to the seeking target or not and evaluate the quality of knowledge map. 4.2. Data analysis 4.2.1. Relevant knowledge network construction old value for cosine similarity. The initial knowledge network is shown in Fig. 3 . The detailed information on the initial knowledge network is shown in Table 1 . 4.2.2. Knowledge importance computing
We measure the importance of an article based on social interaction analysis and network structure analysis. For the performance.
 (8) . The value of KIS is interval [0,1], and the threshold value of KIS is 0.5.

The characteristics of the knowledge network for  X  X  X ocial network X  X  in Wikipedia are shown in Fig. 6 . The detailed infor-mation on the final knowledge network for  X  X  X ocial network X  X  is shown in Table 2 . 4.2.3. Knowledge concept ontology construction in Wikipedia
After knowledge importance analysis, we obtain a knowledge network in which all of the nodes are important and relevant to the seeking target. To provide the knowledge map and recommendation reading sequence, we construct the knowledge concept ontology related to the seeking target. The final social network knowledge concept ontology is shown in Fig. 7 . Note that to present a more concise and clear knowledge map, some category labels are reorganized. For example, simplifying it as  X  X  X ethods X  X  and  X  X  X ociology X  X . After the label simplification process, some of category levels can be consolidated. 4.2.4. Knowledge visualization and navigation strategies
The final step is to recommend articles of high importance and good quality to knowledge seekers. In order to reduce the information overflow problem, this study provides a knowledge map and reading sequence. A knowledge map can help a knowledge seeker to view the knowledge overview of the seeking target. A knowledge flow offers a reading path so they face is shown in Figs. 8 , 9 and 10 are respectively the recommended knowledge map and knowledge flow for seeking the target  X  X  X ocial network. X  X 
To show whether our approach has better performance to help user to learn new knowledge than today X  X  Wikipedia plat-form, the participants are asked to join the three-stage experiments with two different systems (basic Wikipedia vs. SKNS). dia vs. SKNS) in the experiment. In the seeking stage, the participants are allowed to spend a maximum 30 min searching for and learning the knowledge about the learning objects (e.g. social network, electronic commerce, and marketing). After the choice questions, which are randomly selected from the question database. Finally, this study requests the participants to evaluate the learning effect by previous experience (evaluation stage). Here this work uses a questionnaire of five-point Likert scale. This study repeats those three stages on two different systems. This study starts the experiment in the basic
Wikipedia interface first. The day after the completion of the experiment in the basic Wikipedia interface, this study learning effectiveness can be evaluated and compared. 4.3. Experiment processes
In order to verify the performance of our approach, this study uses and compares three different approaches to generate a knowledge map and knowledge flow for each seeking target. Four types of recommendation approach were used: 1. Random approach: the easiest approach to determining the recommendation article, knowledge map, and knowledge flow for a seeking target. It simply follows the article X  X  internal hyperlinks and randomly selects some of those articles as the recommended reading articles. 2. Important degree approach: this approach decides the knowledge map, knowledge flow, and recommended reading arti-cles based on the article X  X  feedback rating. It selects the articles with high feedback rating as the recommended reading articles. 3. Similarity-based approach: this mechanism uses the similarity of other articles and the seeking targets to determine the recommended articles. Articles which are less similar will be filtered out in this mechanism. 4. SKNS approach: the approach we propose in this study. This approach uses similarity analysis and knowledge importance analysis to determine the recommended articles.
 1988 ). Lin and Hsueh (2006) and Su and Wang (2010) adopted precision to evaluate the quality of recommended knowledge map. Precision measures the percentage of relevant documents in relation to the number of documents retrieved. In this study, we view a seeking target as a category designation, and adopt precision and measures to evaluate how accurate the knowledge map creation method complies with experts in assigning documents to specific categories and use the five-point Likert scale for users to verify the recommendation of knowledge flow on learning performance. U the set of documents allocated to a category by an expert, and U the knowledge map creation method. The formula of recommendation X  X  precision rate ( PR ) is written as:
The whole knowledge map X  X  precision rate is calculated by averaging the values of precision and recall respectively from all categories of the modified knowledge map. 5. Results and evaluations
In this section, the experimental results and inspect insights which obtained from the observation and analysis are cles for knowledge seekers. Then, we compare the knowledge learning performance between the basic Wikipedia interface and the SKNS interface. A quiz and self-evaluation questionnaire is used to verify the navigating performance of knowledge seekers ( Shee &amp; Wang, 2008 ). 5.1. Article recommendation accuracy
In this paper, our recommendation approach is compared with three other benchmark approaches via evaluating the pre-but the method used to filter out irrelevant articles is different. The results of different recommendation approaches are to all three seeking targets. 5.2. Knowledge map quality
We compare the quality of the knowledge map generated by the proposed SKNS approach and the three other approaches. To examine the quality of knowledge maps, we invited experts to evaluate them with a score ranging from zero significant level the knowledge map generated by the SKNS approach significantly outperforms those of the other three approaches. 5.3. Knowledge flow quality
We also compare the quality of the knowledge flow generated by the proposed SKNS approach and the other three significant level the knowledge map generated by the SKNS approach significantly outperforms those of the other three approaches. 5.4. SKNS learning performance
Pretest-posttest, which measures the change resulting from experimental treatments, is widely used in behavioral the knowledge-seeking performance of proposed SKNS mechanism with that of Wikipedia. Quiz is one of the most common methods to evaluate people X  X  learning performance. This research invited the participants to answer three questions after a randomly selected from the question database as shown in Appendix A . To assess the validity of the questionnaire, it was examined by 37 MIS or Marketing researchers. The internal consistency and reliability were tested by means of the Cron-interfaces. The average number of correct answers of quiz is 2.6129 and 2.0323 in the posttest and the pretest on seeking and shown in Table 9 . At the 95% significant level, the test results show that the seeking knowledge performance with SKNS interface (posttest) significantly outperforms than basic Wikipedia interface (pretest) in all three seeking targets. 5.5. Learning interface satisfaction performance
Because the learning effective is a kind of subjective feeling, it cannot be measured by simply using quiz. So, this study
The detailed content of questionnaire is shown in Table 10 . Then, according to this questionnaire, this study can find the results show that the overall learning satisfaction in the SKNS interface significantly outperforms than basic Wikipedia interface (see Table 11 ).
 6. Discussions and conclusion
In online encyclopedia platforms which have a large amount of data, it is essential to find those articles which are worth reading. For example, Wikipedia, a free encyclopedia with more than twenty two million articles contributed by countless information is an important.
 To obtain information need from a collection of information resources, information retrieval (IR) techniques ( Cheong &amp;
Lee, 2009; He et al., 2010 ) were used to improve search performance. However, it cannot answer the question, such as  X  X  X hich article is important and worth reading? X  X . To solve the above issue, link analysis or social rating mechanisms ( Wu and misuse. A knowledge map is one of the methods used in knowledge visualization to represent the relationships between relevant articles. A knowledge flow can provide relevant knowledge to people that helps them seeking their knowledge needs quickly and effectively.

This paper proposes a social knowledge navigation recommendation system for online encyclopedias. The proposed knowledge concept ontology building, to recommend a knowledge map and knowledge flow (article reading sequence) of knowledge map and knowledge flow can effectively assist the knowledge seeker to acquire the relevant knowledge. 6.1. Research contributions
This study makes several significant contributions as follows. First, from the methodological perspective, it provides a novel and useful approach utilizing the techniques of text mining analysis, social network analysis, and knowledge ontology building to visually recommend articles on an online encyclopedia platform. Moreover, this proposed framework could be applied to develop recommendation applications in other text-based knowledge sharing platforms. Second, from the prac-tical perspective, according to the experimental results, this study provides a visualized interface that can effectively improve the learning activities of knowledge seekers in online encyclopedias. The proposed visualized knowledge map and knowledge flow can reduce the information overflow problem in online encyclopedias. Because the system investigates and organizes the whole structure of an article, seeking and learning new knowledge in online free encyclopedias is easier and more effective. In addition, according to the experimental results, we found the proposed mechanism can increase not only the participants X  leaning performance but also the overall learning satisfaction, besides system precision commonly used in information retrieval.
 6.2. Limitations and future work
With regard to the study X  X  limitations, knowledge seekers have to express explicitly what they want to learn without ambiguity and the keywords have to exist in the encyclopedia platform. In this context, semantic analysis is an important procedure that can be used to further improve the system and solve the ambiguity problem. Second, although our system platform and there is still an information overload problem for some knowledge seekers. Therefore, summarizing the articles would be another way to improve article quality and reduce the information overflow problem. Third, our mechanism only properly, the views of both article readers and editors should be taken into account in future work. Lastly, the proposed mechanism does not provide personalized recommendations, even though the requirements of different knowledge seekers must vary. If future research included the inputs of personal preference and experience, the recommendation results would be closer to the knowledge needs of individuals.
