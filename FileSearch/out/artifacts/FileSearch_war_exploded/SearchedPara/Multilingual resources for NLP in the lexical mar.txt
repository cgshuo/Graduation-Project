A second aspect involves optimizing the process leading to their integration in applications. With this respect, we believe that a consensual specification on monolingual, bilingual and multilingual lexicons can be a useful aid for the various NLP actors. Within ISO, one purpose of Lexical Markup Framework (LMF, ISO-24613) is to define a standard for lexicons that covers multilingual lexical data. Keywords LMF Standardization Lexicon Multilingual ISO-TC37 1 Introduction Lexical markup framework (LMF) is a model that provides a common standardized framework for the construction of natural language processing (NLP) lexicons. The goals of LMF are to provide a common model for the creation and use of lexical resources, to manage the exchange of data between and among these resources, and to enable the merging of a large number of individual electronic resources to form proposal range from morphology, syntax and semantics to translation information organized as different extensions of an obligatory descriptive core package. LMF is intended for NLP lexicons to be used in a non-restricted range of applications and languages. LMF is also intended for machine readable dictionaries (MRD), which are not within the scope of this paper.

In this paper, we offer a snapshot of how the standard proposed for representing multilingual information looks like. The full technical specification may be found in (LMF 2008 ). 2 History and current context been studied and addressed by a series of projects like EUROTRA-7, GENELEX (Antoni-Lay 1994 ), MULTEXT (Ide and Ve  X  ronis 1994 ), EAGLES (Calzolari 1996 ), PAROLE (Zampolli 1997 ), SIMPLE (Lenci 2000 ), ISLE (Atkins 2002 ) and MILE (Bertagna 2004 ). Although the standards issued by these projects had been widely adopted by research institutions and academy, they also needed adoption within the industrial community to support advanced language technologies for content access and sharing. In order to reach wide industrial audience, production and ratification by an official International body seemed necessary. In 2002, the ISO-TC37 National delegations decided to address standards dedicated to resources for NLP.
These standards are currently elaborated as high level specifications and deal with word segmentation (ISO 24614), annotations (ISO 24611, 24612 and 24615), upon.

These standards deploy low level specifications dedicated to constants, namely data categories (revision of ISO 12620), language codes (ISO 639 or IETF BCP-47 tags for the identification of languages ), script codes (ISO 15924), country codes (ISO 3166), dates (ISO 8601) and Unicode (ISO 10646).
This is the essence of the  X  X  X tructure-adornment X  X  binomial which neatly separates the standardization effort into high-level specification (the structure) and low-level specification (the adornment). In LMF, this combination allows the implementation of standard-conformant lexical resources.

The two level organization has been devised to form a coherent family of standards with the following simple rules: (1) the high level specifications provide structural classes. Each class is defined by (2) the low level specifications provide standardized constants and attribute name. 3 Scope and challenges challenges posed by most of existing lexical models which are complex and very different in nature from each other, because they contain different types of information and are aimed at different purposes.

LMF addresses the following topics:  X  Represent words in languages where multiple orthographies (native scripts or  X  Represent explicitly (i.e. in extension) the morphology of languages where a  X  Represent the morphology of languages where a description in extension of all  X  Easily associate written forms and spoken forms for all languages.  X  Represent complex agglutinating compound words like in German.  X  Represent fixed, semi-fixed and flexible multiword expressions.  X  Represent specific syntactic behaviors, as defined by EAGLES.  X  Allow complex argument mapping between syntactic and semantic descriptions,  X  Allow a semantic organisation based on SynSets (like in WordNet) or on  X  Represent large scale multilingual resources based on interlingual pivots or on 4 Modeling standard used by LMF The LMF specification complies with the modeling principles of Unified Modeling Language (UML) as defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) (Rumbaugh 2004 ). UML is a general-purpose visual modeling language that is used to specify, visualize, construct and document data structures. The modeling language is intended to unify past experience of modeling techniques and to incorporate current software best practices into a coherent approach.

UML has been chosen for the following reasons:  X  UML is the  X  X e facto X  standard for modeling in the Industry. That means that a  X  UML is well defined and documented;  X  The use of diagrams is very efficient when a model needs to be presented and  X  UML allows designers (and readers) to partition large models into workable  X  Various powerful UML tools are available now in order to ease the design
UML captures information about the static structure and dynamic behavior of a although XML is just one way of expressing an LMF model. We defined an XML DTD for the purpose of driving any LMF process and designing concrete lexicon instances. This DTD can be used automatically by a program to check the conformance of a given lexicon. 5 Structure and core package LMF sticks to the very well consolidated ISO strategy to split the specification into two separate objects: the structure and the content. LMF defines the structure of the lexicon while the features that encode information in form of attribute-value pairs are not defined here but are recorded in the ISO Data Category Registry as specified by ISO-12620 ( 1999 ). More precisely, LMF defines class names, class usages, class relations by means of English texts and UML diagrams. This specification goes with attribute-value pairs like/grammatical gender/and/feminine/are not defined within LMF.
LMF is comprised of two types of packages: (1) the core package that consists of a structural skeleton in order to represent the (2) extensions to the core package that reuse the core classes in conjunction with
From the point of view of UML, an extension is a UML package. Current extensions for NLP dictionaries are: NLP Morphology, 2 NLP Morphological pattern, NLP Multiword expression pattern, NLP Syntax, NLP Semantic, Constraint expression and Multilingual notations, which is the focus of this paper. The core package is specified by the following UML class model (Fig. 1 ).
The class called Lexical Resource represents the entire resource and is a container for all the lexical entries of the same language.

The Lexical Entry class is a container for managing the top level language instances. As a consequence, the number of representatives of single words, multi-word expressions and affixes of the lexicon is equal to the number of lexical entries in a given lexicon. The Form and Sense classes are parts of the Lexical Entry . Therefore, the Lexical Entry manages the relationship between sets of related forms and their senses.
 If there is more than one orthography for the word form (e.g. transliteration) the Form class may be associated with one to many Form Representations , each of which contains a specific orthography and one to many data categories that describe the attributes of that orthography.

Definition is a class representing a narrative description of a sense. It is displayed for human users to facilitate their understanding of a Lexical Entry and is not meant to be processable by computer programs. Each Definition instance may be asso-ciated with zero to many Text Representation instances in order to manage the text definition in more than one language or script. Statement is a class representing a narrative description and refines or complements Definition . 6 NLP Multilingual notation extension 6.1 Overview mapping between two or more languages in an LMF resource. The model is based on the notion of Axis that links Sense , Syntactic Behavior and Context that are defined in semantic, syntactic, and MRD packages. Syntactic Behaviour is a class illustrate the particular meaning of a Sense instance. Axis is a term taken from the languages. 6.2 Considerations for standardizing multilingual data The simplest configuration of multilingual data is a bilingual lexicon where a single link is used to represent the translation of a given form/sense pair from one language into another. But a survey of actual practices clearly reveals other requirements that make the model more complex.
Consequently, LMF has focused on the following ones: (1) Cases where the relation 1 to -1 is impossible because of lexical differences (2) The bilingual lexicon approach should be optimized to allow the easiest (3) The model should cover both transfer and pivot approaches to translation, (4) A situation that is not very easy to deal with is how to represent translations to (5) The model should allow for representing the information that restricts or 6.3 Structure The model is based on the notion of Axis that link Sense , Syntactic Behavior and Context instances pertaining to different languages. An Axis instance is not specific Lexical Resource instance.

Axis instances can be organized at the lexicon manager convenience in order to and one or several relations.
 The UML class model is a UML package as follows (Fig. 2 ).
 6.4 Sense Axis Sense Axis is used to link closely related senses in different languages, under the facilitates the representation of the translation of words that do not necessarily have the same valence or morphological form in one language and in another. 6.5 Interlingual External Ref A Sense Axis instance may be associated with one or several Interlingual External define a bridge to one or several system s. Interlingual External Ref is provided for this particular purpose.
 6.6 Sense Axis Relation Sense Axis Relatio n permits to describe the linking between two different Sense Axis specialization of  X  X  X leuve X  X  compared to  X  X  X ivie ` re X  X  and  X  X  X iver X  X . 6.7 Transfer Axis Transfer Axis is designed to represent multilingual transfer approach. Here, linkage refers to information contained in syntax. For example, this approach enables the manque X  X  =&gt; eng:  X  X  X  miss her X  X . 6.8 Transfer Axis Relation Transfer Axis Relation links two Transfer Axis instances. 6.9 Source Test and Target Test Source Test permits to express a condition on the translation on the source language side while Target Test does it on the target language side. 6.10 Context Axis Context Axis supplies documentation for sample translations. The purpose is not to record large scale multilingual corpora. The goal is to link a Lexical Entry with a typical example of translation. 6.11 Context Axis Relation Context Axis Relation links Context Axis instances. 7 Two examples 7.1 Simple example of a near match represent a near match between  X  X  X leuve X  X  in French and  X  X  X iver X  X  in English. There are two senses in French and one sense in English. In the diagram, French is located on the left side and English on the right side. Multilingual notations are located in the middle. The axis on the top implements a direct semantic equivalence between more specific term in French is not linked directly to any English sense because this notion does not exist in English (Fig. 3 ).
 7.2 Example in three languages of a shared transfer structure A second example shows how to use the Transfer Axis relation to relate different information in a multilingual transfer lexicon (Fig. 4 ).
 While the more general sense links the English  X  X  X evelop X  X  and the Spanish  X  X  X esarrollar X  X , a second correspondence expresses restrictions that should be tested in the source language: if the second argument of the construction refers to a certain Italian verbs. 8 Other modeling options for multilingual notations For NLP lexicons, we did not retain models based on simple bilingual links because when the number of pairs of language increases, the number of links explodes to unmanageable proportions. Such an organization cannot be named as multilingual. Another option would have been to consider that the notion of a concept is the most important notion in the resource. According to this organization (usually named as written forms are the leaves. This organization is the one retained by TBX (i.e. ISO DIS-30042) for instance. This structure is quite simple and is well suited for simple mono and/or multilingual terminologies but it appears that language representations The main point is that linguistic descriptions, for a given language need to be both more powerful and highly shared.

More precisely:  X  Syntactic representations like subcategorization frames need more complex  X  Transfer representations (see Transfer Axis class in LMF) that are so important  X  An interlingual pivot must not be mandatory for the words that are specific to a  X  Morphological patterns that are mandatory for representing complex languages  X  Multiword expression patterns must also be defined and shared.

The option that we retained is to have both the notion of lexicon (holding wants to have only interlingual axes, LMF allows this option. This user just has to use the notion of lexical resource and to manage Sense Axis instances. But obviously, as a consequence, such an NLP lexicon without any morphology or syntax does not allow very powerful processings. 9 LMF in XML 9.1 Chosen option A DTD is provided as an informative annex in the ISO document (LMF 2008 ). following XML tags: 9.2 Other options There might be differing modeling approaches concerning XML serialization. We decided to use an XML DTD in the ISO document because:  X  a DTD is still the most accessible mechanism for tag structure, due to the fact  X  a DTD is concise, thus is more easily readable than a more lengthy specification.
But three other technical options are possible: a Relax-NG specification (i.e. ISO 19757-2), a W3C schema 5 or an RDF description. In the near future, if our users require such specifications we could easily write an additional ISO technical report that will be associated to the LMF document. 10 Comparison A serious comparison with previously existing models and concrete usage of consult the technical report  X  X  X xtended examples of lexicons using LMF X  X  located at: Monachini et al. 2007 ). 11 Conclusion The present description is based on the LMF model specified in the Final Draft for International Standard (FDIS) version. The final International Standard (IS) stage is scheduled for Winter 2008. 6 In this paper we presented the results of the ongoing research activity of the LMF ISO standard. In order to reach a consensus, the work done has paid careful attention to the similarities and differences of existing lexicons and the models behind them. In the future, the LMF users will be able to:  X  use an interoperable model;  X  have a model that allows a wide range of representations;  X  use standard based tools like interactive software platforms, lexicon mergers or References
