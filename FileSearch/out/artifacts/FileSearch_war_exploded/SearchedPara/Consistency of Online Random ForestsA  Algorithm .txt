 Candidate split dimension A dimension along which a split may be made. Candidate split point One of the first m structure points to arrive in a leaf. N Algorithm 1 BuildTree Require: Initially the tree has exactly one leaf (TreeRoot) which covers the whole space Require: The dimensionality of the input, D . Parameters  X  , m and  X  .

Proof of Proposition 3 L We can write By assumption  X  ( I c ) = 0, so we have the integral and the limit, and by assumption the conditional risk converges to the Bayes risk for all I  X  X  , so which proves the claim.

The above two conditions must be satisfied. 3. Another structure point must arrive in A to force a split. t  X  t 1  X  t 2  X  t 3 = t we have We can rewrite the first and last term in more friendly notation as large enough that and so make sufficiently large.
