 1. Introduction
Gait analysis is becoming a crucial assessment tool in clinics and hospitals. It provides new insights into human locomotion for assessing gait abnormalities and treatment outcomes. The pre-dominant method for human gait analysis is the optical motion system using high-speed cameras to record human 3-D motion ( Karaulovaa et al., 2002 ; Gavrila and Davis, 1996 ; Holt et al., 2000 ). However, there are a number of limitations to this technique: the optical gait analysis system requires expensive equipment and a relatively large amount of space; it requires data processing times that preclude clinical application in real time; and limb movements cause obscuration of the reflective markers, requiring reliance on extrapolation by auto-tracking paradigms.
An alternative method for measuring internal forces generated from the locomotion is using body-worn inertial sensors ( Bonato, 2005 ; Giansanti et al., 2005 ; Jasiewicz et al., 2006 ; Luinge and Veltink, 2005 ; Mayagoitaia et al., 2002 ; Pappas et al., 2001 ;
Tao et al. (2009) reported that all eight gait events can be detected for healthy subjects using three gyroscopes and one accelerometer attached to the foot, shank, and thigh segments. Pappas et al. (2001) designed a gait phase detection system to detect gait phases for both healthy and impaired gait subjects using a gyroscope on foot and three force sensitive resistors.
 healthy subjects by Lau et al. (2008) , a small sensor unit compromising an accelerometer and a gyroscope was developed to detect motions of segments, the captured kinematic data were used to classify five walking conditions: stair ascent, stair descent, level ground, upslope, and downslope. Moreover, classification of walking, running, and cycling conditions has been carried out by
Parkka et al. (2006) . The physical activities for Parkinson X  X  disease patients were monitored by Salarian et al. (2007) , where periods of sitting and standing were detected using three inertial sensors units: one sensor unit was attached to the trunk and included a bi-axial accelerometer and a gyroscope, the two other sensors were attached to the shanks and each consisted of a gyroscope.
Additionally, a commercial product, the IDEFA s (Minisun, Cali-fornia, USA) has been developed to monitor physical activity using a portable data logger and five inertial sensors. studies have investigated different techniques such as statistical analysis methods, mathematical transforms, and machine learn-ing approaches (support vector machine, neural networks, and fuzzy logic). It is found that the traditional statistical methods are the most widely applied and understood for gait analysis. Statis-tical classifiers of gait kinetic data have been adopted in Jonesa et al. (2006) and Takahashi et al. (2004 ). However, it often provides limited additional insight into gait data ( Chau, 2001a ), and has fallen short in meeting persistent challenges of quanti-tative and objective analysis ( Chau, 2001b ). Mathematical trans-forms were investigated for kinetic data ( Kohle and Merkl, 2000 ;
Mezghani et al., 2008 ) and for kinematic data ( Ismail and Asfour, 1999 ). Transforms compute approximation coefficients that are used as feature vectors to represent gait data. A limitation of the mathematical transforms approach based on its frequent applica-tion to univariate signal and little guidelines on selection of wavelet basis for gait data ( Chau, 2001b ).
 represent and analyze gait data. This approach demonstrates the ability to capture patterns and to model the complex non-linear relationships in gait data. Support vector machine (SVM) was investigated for the automatic recognition of kinematic and kinetic gait patterns in Begg and Kamruzzaman (2005) , Lau et al. (2008) , and Lai et al., 2009 ). Neural networks (NN) was examined in Hanson et al. (2009) , Kohle and Merkl (2000) , and
Parkka et al. (2006 ). A drawback of these methods lies in the performance dependence on internal learning parameters (e.g. weights and biases, network size, and selection of initial weights for NN, and regularization parameter for SVM), which are difficult to interpret. Fuzzy clustering technique has been used in O X  X alley et al. (1997) , Salarian et al. (2007) , and Tan et al., 1999 ). Clustering techniques categorize and classify gait data into groups or clusters for the purposes of diagnosing gait abnormalities or classification of everyday physical activities. Rarely, gait analysis is used to make medical diagnosis. Most commonly, it is requested to provide quantitative information about the mobility state of a medical disorder in order to help in the prescription of treatment and the assessment of its outcome ( Simon, 2004 ). tigated. Fuzzy logic exhibits the benefits of: (1) reducing the massive data extracted from gait kinetics and kinematics in 3D, (2) easy to interpret and understand, (3) offering insight into non-linear relationships among gait variables, (4) providing two independent force plates mounted beneath the belts as shown in Fig. 1 . Each force plate consists of strain gauge load transducers that precisely measure GRFs in three directions ( F X : mediolateral, F Y : anterioposterior, and F Z : vertical).
The GRF data were acquired at a frequency of 100 Hz and filtered using 20 Hz second-order Butterworth low pass filter. F Z , the vertical component of GRF was used to determine the gait cycle and the associated phases; the phases start when one foot contacts the ground and ends when the same foot contacts the ground again. Based on Perry (1992) and Yu et al. (2010 ) seven gait phases are defined in a full gait cycle as follows: loading response (0 X 10%), midstance (10 X 30%), terminal stance (30 X 50%), preswing (50 X 60%), initial swing (60 X 70%), midswing (70 X 85%), and terminal swing (85 X 100%).

Time-normalization was accomplished by re-sampling and expressing each stride in percentages rather than in time ( Winter, 2009 ). Moreover, the mean value of the GRFs was calculated across all strides within the three minutes duration of the trial, the total strides were based on the speed, whereby the minimum number of strides was 70. The amplitudes were normalized based on the maximum value of the mean. 2.2.2. Wearable sensors
A wearable inertial sensor system was developed to acquire the kinematic data (accelerations) of body segments ( Lau et al., 2008 ; Mayagoitaia et al., 2002 ; Sarkodie-Gyan et al., 2011 ; Takeda et al., 2009 ; Tao et al., 2009 ). The system consists of ADXL330 iMEMS s accelerometers (Analog Devices Inc.) and 12-bits analog to digital converter A/D (National Instruments Inc.). The ADXL330 is a low power and three axis accelerometer with a minimum full-scale range of 7 3 g. An array of eight accelerometers was used for both left and right legs to record the accelerations in three directions; four accelerometers were fitted on each leg at the foot, shank, thigh, and hip. Fig. 2 depicts the placement and coordi-nates of the sensors.

The output of the sensors was acquired at a frequency of 100 Hz, a 6 Hz second-order Butterworth low pass filter was applied to lower the noise and improve the resolution of the accelerometers ( Winter, 2009 ). In a similar way to GRF data processing, the acceleration data were averaged and normalized across all strides. 2.3. Fuzzy rule-based relational matrix 2.3.1. Fuzzy sets
The fuzzy set of GRF data was described as the force compo-nents, x , from GRF collection X , expressed as x A X , X  X f F X F Y F Z g , where { y } indicates the 3D GRFs.

The first relational matrix was defined as P ( x , y )  X  the relation between the GRF data and gait phases, the second relational matrix was defined as Q ( z , y )  X  the relationship between accel-erations and gait phases. P ( x , y ) and Q ( z , y ) relational matrices of sizes 3 7 and 12 7, respectively, are expressed as
P  X  x , y  X  X 
Q  X  z , y  X  X  representing the strength of association or interaction amongst the elements of gait functions (GRFs, accelerations, and gait phases). 2.4. Fuzzy similarity algorithm input test data and the reference rule-base data. This algorithm
Fig. 3 depicts the 3-D GRFs for both healthy and MS subjects within the full gait cycle, whilst Fig. 4 illustrates the 3-D accelerations of the lower extremity segments for both healthy and MS subjects within the full gait cycle.

Utilizing the fuzzy relational matrices described above, a rule-base, relational matrix, was established to represent the feature
P test ( x , y ) for individual subject, and the similarity matrix between them is expressed as
P ref  X  x , y  X  n P test  X  x , y  X  X  curve of healthy subjects exhibits the M shape with two peaks to reflect the weight transfer from the heel to the mid-foot and to the ball of the foot for push-off. These differences were repre-sented by the low grades of similarity for F Z within the swing phases ( Similarity  X  0.179 for initial swing ( phase5 ), 0.008 for midswing ( phase6 ), and 0.289 for terminal swing ( phase7 )), and the moderate similarities for both F Y and F Z within the loading response phase ( phase1 )( Similarity  X  0.634 and 0.659, respec-tively) as shown in Table 2 .

In MS subjects, the long stance phase, and therefore lack of sufficient swing phase, is caused by the abnormal muscle activ-ities of shank (tibialis anterior), thigh (quadriceps), and hip (gluteus medius). This abnormality also leads to insufficient accelerations (forces) of the thigh and the hip as shown in Fig. 4 . The acceleration curves of the thigh and the hip, Hip Y , demonstrate low value of accelerations for MS compared to healthy subjects throughout most of the gait phases with some variations. This can be observed in Table 3 by the low grades of similarity for the thigh within some gait phases (the lowest grades of similarity are 0.461 for Thigh X and 0.456 for Thigh Y within the preswing phase ( phase4 ), and 0.467 for Thigh Z within the terminal swing phase ( phase7 )), and the moderate similarity for the anterioposterior acceleration of Hip, Hip Y (the average similarity for 4 gait phases is 0.542).

The behavior of the foot acceleration depicts that the MS subjects exhibit sharp increased acceleration at the initial contact and lack of foot clearance at the initial swing phase as shown in Fig. 4 .

In view of these results, a quantitative assessment of the neurological state of the subject can be evaluated. This algorithm may serve as an assessment tool for clinician and doctors to gain substantial insight into the neurological state of gait and evaluate the outcomes of surgery and/or therapy. 5. Conclusion
In this paper, gait data including limb-segment accelerations and GRFs in 3D were collected simultaneously during the experi-mentation. The collected data served as input into a rule-based relational matrix built upon the principle of fuzzy computational algorithm (Eq. (1)). Fuzzy similarity algorithm was used to per-form the comparison between the reference rule-based data and an input test data (Eq. (2)). The proposed methodology was tested and evaluated using two groups of subjects: healthy subjects were recruited to establish the reference rule-base, and MS patients to establish the input test rule-base, and the grade of similarity between them was evaluated ( Tables 2 and 3 ). Sig-nificant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to limb-segments accelerations and GRFs data throughout the gait phases.

This study demonstrates an efficient method of gait character-ization utilizing wearable sensors through building and comparing the reference rule-base of healthy subjects with an input rule-base of impaired subjects using a fuzzy similarity algorithm. This similarity can provide a quantitative assessment of the neurological state of the subject, which may be useful for clinician and doctors to identify pathological gait impairments, prescribe treatment, and assess the improvements in response to therapeutic intervention.
With further development of these concepts and methods, it may be possible to develop novel systems for quantification of gait function and disability. More specifically, it may be suggested that the combination of wearable sensors and the fuzzy algorithm analysis utilized in this study are worthy of further exploration as a potential basis for more flexible, efficient, and cost-effective technologies for clinical gait assessment.
