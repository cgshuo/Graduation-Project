 With the rapid development of information technology, the availability of huge amounts of online information makes retrieval a hard task for the average user. R ecommender systems (RS) have been employed across several domains to e ase this so -called  X  X nformation overload X  problem since the mid -1990s . Recently, context -aware recommender systems (CARS), aiming to further improve the performance accuracy and user satisfaction by fully utilizing contextual information ( such as time, location , mood and company ) into RS, has become one of the h ottest topics [1] . Although a certain progress has been made , CARS still has to face to many challenges . This thesis investigates some key problems in CARS and then proposes some tested and untested approaches to min e the latent relationship among users, context ual information and items (such as movies, web pages and mobile services) . In this thesis , the first task is how to elicit contextual user preferences i mplicitly . All of the existing CARS are based on the assumption that there are available explicit contextual user ratings (e.g.,  X  Sam  X  Avat ar  X  Morning  X  Home  X  3 X ) . However, it is hard to obtain sufficient context ual user preferences in practice. This thesis propose s a MAUT (multi attribute utility theory) -based approach to i mplicitly elicit contextual user preferences through analyzing contextual user behavior s. It consider s every type of context as an attribute of items , elicit every unidimensional contextual user preferences based on a n ew context -b ased IF-IDF formula , and finally elicit multidimensional contextual user preferences after identifying different weights of different contexts . We design a personalized mobile services -oriented prototype system as a test bed to elicit contextual user preferences as well as generate contextual recommendations. I perform experimental comparison of this approach against the other baseline approaches, attaining significant improvements . Secondly, how to alleviate the sparsity problem in CARS is a key incorporating contextual information, the problem of sparse in CARS becomes even more serious. I propose a HOSVD-based contextual recommendation approach , called TensorCARS [2]. It first construct s an N -order tensor to represent multidimensional contextual user preferences and decomposes it into ( N -2) 3 -order tensors according to different context s, then use s the HOSVD technique to predict unknown unidimensional contextual user preferences, and then calculate s every contextual influence coefficient that each context factor influences user preferences, and finally construct s a new N -order tensor using weighted linearization method. I perform experimental comparison using the prototype system , showing Ten sorCARS can help alleviate the sparsity problem and increase the prediction accuracy . Thirdly, I consider mood as an imp ortant context and design two mood-based hybrid collaborative filtering approaches . ACM CAMRa2010 [3] releases two datasets gathered by the Moviepilot and Filmtipset. I participate in the Moviepilot challenge track which addresses the contextual dimension related to a user  X  X  mood. I first propose a new mood-based user -based collaborative filtering approach based on the assumption that user s with similar mood -preference patterns may have similar user preferences to items , and then propose two new hybrid ones through fusing the former presented approach and the traditional user -based CF (i.e., a multiple -step KNN similarity fusion and a weigh ted predicted rating fusion strategy respectively ). Both hybrid CF approaches outperform the other user -based CF ones in terms of all three evaluation metrics ( i.e., MAP, P@ N ( N =5, 10) and AUC ). Lastly, I focus on bring social network analysis into CARS in order to further improve recommendation accuracy . Intuitively , user needs are not only affected by his interest s and environment, but also by many other factors such as social network relationship ( due to the content and information contributed or distrib uted through the Social Web ). Now I am designing a general model of social network -based c ontext -aware recommender systems (SCRS) to search nearest neighbors in high dimensional spaces that contain both social network s and contextual user preferences data. I plan to perform experiments on the public Filmtipset dataset . This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 60872051. [1] G. Adomavicius and A.
