 We consider the task of extracting entities of a given category (e.g., hiking trails ) from web pages. Previous approaches either (i) assume that the same entities appear on multiple web pages, or (ii) require information such as seed examples (Etzioni et al., 2005; Wang and Cohen, 2009; Dalvi et al., 2012). These approaches work well for common categories but encounter data sparsity problems for more specific categories, such as the products of a small company or the dishes at a lo-cal restaurant. In this context, we may have only a single web page that contains the information we need and no seed examples.

In this paper, we propose a novel task, zero-shot entity extraction , where the specification of the desired entities is provided as a natural language query. Given a query (e.g., hiking Figure 1: Entity extraction typically requires ad-ditional knowledge such as a small set of seed ex-amples or depends on multiple web pages. In our setting, we take as input a natural language query and extract entities from a single web page. trails near Baltimore ) and a web page (e.g., http://www.everytrail.com/best/ hiking-baltimore-maryland ), the goal is to extract all entities corresponding to the query on that page (e.g., Avalon Super Loop , etc.). Figure 1 summarizes the task setup.

The task introduces two challenges. Given a single web page to extract entities from, we can no longer rely on the redundancy of entities across multiple web pages. Furthermore, in the zero-shot learning paradigm (Larochelle et al., 2008), where entire categories might be unseen during training, the system must generalize to new queries and web pages without the additional aid of seed examples.
To tackle these challenges, we cast the task as a structured prediction problem where the input is the query and the web page, and the output is a list of entities, mediated by a latent extraction predicate . To generalize across different inputs, we rely on two types of features: structural fea-tures, which look at the layout and placement of the entities being extracted; and denotation fea-tures, which look at the list of entities as a whole and assess their linguistic coherence. When defin-ing features on lists, one technical challenge is be-ing robust to widely varying list sizes. We ap-proach this challenge by defining features over a histogram of abstract tokens derived from the list elements.

For evaluation, we created the O PEN W EB dataset comprising natural language queries from the Google Suggest API and diverse web pages re-turned from web search. Despite the variety of queries and web pages, our system still achieves a test accuracy of 40.5% and an accuracy at 5 of 55.8%. We define the zero-shot entity extraction task as follows: let x be a natural language query (e.g., hiking trails near Baltimore ), and w be a web page. Our goal is to construct a mapping from ( x,w ) to a list of entities y (e.g., [ Avalon Super Loop , Patapsco Valley State Park , . . . ]) which are extracted from the web page.

Ideally, we would want our data to be anno-tated with the correct entity lists y , but this would be very expensive to obtain. We instead define each training and test example as a triple ( x,w,c ) , where the compatibility function c maps each y to c ( y )  X  { 0 , 1 } denoting the (approximate) correct-ness of the list y . In this paper, an entity list y is compatible ( c ( y ) = 1 ) when the first, second, and last elements of y match the annotation; otherwise, it is incompatible ( c ( y ) = 0 ). 2.1 Dataset To experiment with a diverse set of queries and web pages, we created a new dataset, O PEN W EB , use the method from Berant et al. (2013) to gen-erate search queries by performing a breadth-first search over the query space. Specifically, we use the Google Suggest API, which takes a par-tial query (e.g.,  X  X ist of movies X  ) and out-puts several complete queries (e.g.,  X  X ist of hor-ror movies X  ). We start with seed partial queries  X  X ist of  X   X  where  X  is one or two initial let-ters. In each step, we call the Google Suggest API on the partial queries to obtain complete queries, Table 1: Rules for generating new partial queries from complete queries. ( X and Y are sequences of words; w is a single word.) and then apply the transformation rules in Table 1 to generate more partial queries from complete queries. We run the procedure until we obtained 100K queries.

Afterwards, we downloaded the top 2 X 3 Google search results of each query, sanitized the web pages, and randomly submitted 8000 query / web page pairs to Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). Each AMT worker must either mark the web page as irrelevant or extract the first, second, and last entities from the page. We only included exam-ples where at least two AMT workers agreed on the answer.

The resulting O PEN W EB dataset consists of 2773 examples from 2269 distinct queries. Among these queries, there are 894 headwords ranging from common categories (e.g., movies, companies, characters) to more specific ones (e.g., enzymes, proverbs, headgears). The dataset con-tains web pages from 1438 web domains, of which 83% appear only once in our dataset.

Figure 2 shows some queries and web pages from the O PEN W EB dataset. Besides the wide range of queries, another main challenge of the dataset comes from the diverse data representa-tion formats, including complex tables, grids, lists, headings, and paragraphs. Figure 3 shows the framework of our system. Given a query x and a web page w , the system generates a set Z ( w ) of extraction predicates z which can extract entities from semi-structured data in w . Section 3.1 describes extraction pred-icates in more detail. Afterwards, the system chooses z  X  Z ( w ) that maximizes the model probability p  X  ( z | x,w ) , and then executes z on Figure 3: An overview of our system. The system uses the input query x and web page w to produce a list of entities y via an extraction predicate z . w to get the list of entities y = J z K w . Section 3.2 describes the model and the training procedure, while Section 3.3 presents the features used in our model. 3.1 Extraction predicates We represent each web page w as a DOM tree, a common representation among wrapper induction and web information extraction systems (Sahuguet and Azavant, 1999; Liu et al., 2000; Crescenzi et al., 2001). The text of any DOM tree node that is shorter than 140 characters is a candidate entity. However, without further restrictions, the number of possible entity lists grows exponentially with the number of candidate entities.

To make the problem tractable, we introduce an extraction predicate z as an intermediate represen-tation for extracting entities from w . In our sys-tem, we let an extraction predicate be a simplified XML path (XPath) such as
Informally, an extraction predicate is a list of path entries . Each path entry is either a tag (e.g., tr ), which selects all children with that tag; or a tag and an index i (e.g., td[1] ), which selects only the i th child with that tag. The denotation y = J z K w of an extraction predicate z is the list of entities selected by the XPath. Figure 4 illustrates the execution of the extraction predicate above on a DOM tree.

In the literature, many information extraction systems employ more versatile extraction predi-cates (Wang and Cohen, 2009; Fumarola et al., 2011). However, despite the simplicity, we are able to find an extraction predicate that extracts a compatible entity list in 69.7% of the develop-ment examples. In some examples, we cannot ex-tract a compatible list due to unrecoverable issues such as incorrect annotation. Section 4.4 provides a detailed analysis of these issues. Additionally, extraction predicates can be easily extended to in-crease the coverage. For example, by introduc-ing new index types [1:] (selects all but the first node) and [:-1] (selects all but the last node), we can increase the coverage to 76.2%.
 Extraction predicate generation. We generate a set Z ( w ) of extraction predicates for a given web page w as follows. For each node in the DOM tree, we find an extraction predicate which selects only that node, and then gener-alizes the predicate by removing any subset of the indices of the last k path entries. For in-stance, when k = 2 , an extraction predicate ending in .../tr[5]/td[2] will be general-ized to .../tr[5]/td[2] , .../tr/td[2] , .../tr[5]/td , and .../tr/td . In all ex-periments, we use k = 8 , which gives at most 2 8 generalized predicates for each original predicate. This generalization step allows the system to se-lect multiple nodes with the same structure (e.g., entity strings y = J z K w from the page (highlighted in red). table cells from the same column or list items from the same section of the page).

Out of all generalized extraction predicates, we retain the ones that extract at least two entities from w . Note that several extraction predicates may select the same list of nodes and thus produce the same list of entities.

The procedure above gives a manageable num-ber of extraction predicates. Among the devel-opment examples of the O PEN W EB dataset, we generate an average of 8449 extraction predicates per example, which evaluate to an average of 1209 unique entity lists. 3.2 Modeling Given a query x and a web page w , we define a log-linear distribution over all extraction predi-cates z  X  X  ( w ) as where  X   X  R d is the parameter vector and  X  ( x,w,z ) is the feature vector, which will be de-fined in Section 3.3.

To train the model, we find a parameter vec-tor  X  that maximizes the regularized log marginal probability of the compatibility function being sat-isfied. In other words, given training data D = where p ( c = 1 | x,w ) = Note that c ( J z K w ) = 1 when the entity list y = J z K w selected by z is compatible with the annota-tion; otherwise, c ( J z K w ) = 0 .

We use AdaGrad, an online gradient descent with an adaptive per-feature step size (Duchi et al., 2010), making 5 passes over the training data. We use  X  = 0 . 01 obtained from cross-validation for all experiments. 3.3 Features To construct the log-linear model, we define a fea-ture vector  X  ( x,w,z ) for each query x , web page w , and extraction predicate z . The final feature vector is the concatenation of structural features  X  ( w,z ) , which consider the selected nodes in the DOM tree, and denotation features  X  d ( x,y ) , which look at the extracted entities.

We will use the query hiking trails near Balti-more and the web page in Figure 4 as a running example. Figure 5 lists some features extracted from the example. 3.3.1 Recipe for defining features on lists One main focus of our work is finding good fea-ture representations for a list of objects (DOM tree nodes for structural features and entity strings for denotation features). One approach is to define the feature vector of a list to be the sum of the feature vectors of individual elements. This is commonly done in structured prediction, where the elements are local configurations (e.g., rule applications in parsing). However, this approach raises a normal-ization issue when we have to compare and rank lists of drastically different sizes.

As an alternative, we propose a recipe for gen-erating features from a list as follows: Figure 6: The recipe for defining features on a list of objects: (i) the abstraction step converts list elements into abstract tokens; (ii) the aggregation step defines features using the histogram of the ab-stract tokens.
 Step 1: Abstraction. We map each list element into an abstract token. For example, we can map each DOM tree node onto an integer equal to the number of children, or map each entity string onto its part-of-speech tag sequence.
 Step 2: Aggregation. We create a histogram of the abstract tokens and define features on proper-ties of the histogram. Generally, we use E NTROPY (entropy normalized to the maximum value of 1), M age of tokens sharing the majority value), and S
INGLE (whether all tokens are identical). For abstract tokens with finitely many possible values (e.g., part-of-speech), we also use the normalized histogram count of each possible value as a fea-ture. And for real-valued abstract tokens, we also use the mean and the standard deviation. In the actual system, we convert real-valued features (en-tropy, histogram count, mean, and standard devia-tion) into indicator features by binning.
 Figure 6 summarizes the steps explained above. We use this recipe for defining both structural and denotation features, which are discussed below. 3.3.2 Structural features Although different web pages represent data in different formats, they still share some common hierarchical structures in the DOM tree. To cap-ture this, we define structural features  X  s ( w,z ) , which consider the properties of the selected nodes in the DOM tree, as follows: Features on selected nodes. We apply our recipe on the list of nodes in w selected by z using the following abstract tokens:  X  T AG , I D , C LASS , etc. (HTML attributes)  X  I NDEX (position among its siblings)  X  P ARENT (parent node; e.g., P ARENT -S INGLE
Additionally, we define the following features based on the coverage of all selected nodes:  X  N O H OLE , H EAD H OLE , etc. (node coverage  X  P AGE C OVERAGE (node coverage relative to Features on ancestor nodes. We also define the same feature set on the list of ancestors of the se-lected nodes in the DOM tree. In our experiments, we traverse up to 5 levels of ancestors and define features from the nodes in each level. 3.3.3 Denotation features Structural features are not powerful enough to dis-tinguish between entity lists appearing in similar structures such as columns of the same table or fields of the same record. To solve this ambiguity, we introduce denotation features  X  d ( x,y ) which considers the coherence or appropriateness of the selected entity strings y = J z K w .

We observe that the correct entities often share some linguistic statistics. For instance, entities in many categories (e.g., people and place names) usually have only 2 X 3 word tokens, most of which are proper nouns. On the other hand, random words on the web page tend to have more diverse lengths and part-of-speech tags.

We apply our recipe on the list of selected enti-ties using the following abstract tokens:  X  W ORDS C OUNT (number of words)  X  P HRASE S HAPE (abstract shape of the phrase;  X  W ORD S HAPE (abstract shape of each word;  X  P HRASE POS and W ORD POS (part-of-In this section we evaluate our system on the O
PEN W EB dataset. 4.1 Evaluation metrics Accuracy. As the main metric, we use a notion of accuracy based on compatibility; specifically, we define the accuracy as the fraction of examples where the system predicts a compatible entity list as defined in Section 2. We also report accuracy at 5 , the fraction of examples where the top five predictions contain a compatible entity list. Table 2: Top 10 path suffix patterns found by the baseline learner in the development data. Since we allow path entries to be permuted, each suffix pattern is represented by a multiset of path entries. The notation [ * ] denotes any path entry index.
To see how our compatibility-based accuracy tracks exact correctness, we sampled 100 web pages which have at least one valid extraction predicate and manually annotated the full list of entities. We found that in 85% of the examples, the longest compatible list y is the correct list of entities, and many lists in the remaining 15% miss the correct list by only a few entities.
 Oracle. In some examples, our system cannot find any list of entities that is compatible with the gold annotation. The oracle score is the fraction of examples in which the system can find at least one compatible list. 4.2 Baseline As a baseline, we list the suffixes of the cor-rect extraction predicates in the training data, and then sort the resulting suffix patterns by frequency. To improve generalization, we treat path entries with different indices (e.g., td[1] vs. td[2] ) as equivalent and allow path entries to be permuted. Table 2 lists the top 10 suffix patterns from the de-velopment data. At test time, we choose an extrac-tion predicate with the most frequent suffix pat-tern. The baseline should work considerably well if the web pages were relatively homogeneous. 4.3 Main results We held out 30% of the dataset as test data. For the results on development data, we report the average across 10 random 80-20 splits. Table 3 shows the results. The system gets an accuracy of 41.1% and 40.5% for the development and test data, respec-tively. If we consider the top 5 lists of entities, the accuracy increases to 58.4% on the development data and 55.8% on the test data. Table 3: Main results on the O PEN W EB dataset using the default set of features. (Acc = accuracy, A@5 = accuracy at 5) 4.4 Error analysis We now investigate the errors made by our system using the development data. We classify the er-rors into two types: (i) coverage errors , which are when the system cannot find any entity list satis-fying the compatibility function; and (ii) ranking errors , which are when a compatible list of entities exists, but the system outputs an incompatible list.
Tables 4 and 5 show the breakdown of cover-age and ranking errors from an experiment on the development data.
 Analysis of coverage errors. From Table 4, about 36% of coverage errors happen when the extraction predicate for the correct entities also captures unrelated parts of the web page (Reason C1). For example, many Wikipedia articles have the See Also section that lists related articles in an unordered list ( /ul/li/a ), which causes a prob-lem when the entities are also represented in the same format.

Another main source of errors is the in-consistency in HTML tag usage (Reason C2). For instance, some web pages use &lt;b&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; tags for bold texts interchangeably, pect that this problem can be solved by normaliz-ing the web page, using an alternative web page representation (Cohen et al., 2002; Wang and Co-hen, 2009; Fumarola et al., 2011), or leveraging more expressive extraction predicates (Dalvi et al., 2011).

One interesting source of errors is Reason C3, where we need to filter the selected entities to match the complex requirement in the query. For example, the query tech companies in China re-quires the system to select only the company names with China in the corresponding location column. To handle such queries, we need a deeper understanding of the relation between the linguis-tic structure of the query and the hierarchical structure of the web page. Tackling this error re-Table 6: System accuracy with different feature and input settings on the development data. (Acc = accuracy, A@5 = accuracy at 5) quires compositionality and is critical to general-ize to more complex queries.
 Analysis of ranking errors. From Table 5, a large number of errors are attributed to the system selecting non-content elements such as navigation links and content headings (Reason R1). Feature analysis reveals that both structural and linguis-tic statistics of these non-content elements can be more coherent than those of the correct entities. We suspect that since many of our features try to capture the coherence of entities, the system some-times erroneously favors the more homonogenous non-content parts of the page. To disfavor these parts, One possible solution is to add visual fea-tures that capture how the web page is rendered and favor more salient parts of the page. (Liu et al., 2003; Song et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2005; Zheng et al., 2007). 4.5 Feature variations We now investigate the contribution of each fea-ture type. The ablation results on the development set over 10 random splits are shown in Table 6. We observe that denotation features improves ac-curacy on top of structural features.

Table 7 shows an example of an error that is eliminated by each feature type. Generally, if the entities are represented as records (e.g., rows of a table), then denotation features will help the system select the correct field from each record. On the other hand, structural features prevent the system from selecting random entities outside the main part of the page. Table 7: System outputs for the query UK news-papers with different feature sets. Without deno-tation features, the system selects the daily circu-lation of each newspaper instead of the newspaper names. And without structural features, the sys-tem selects the hidden navigation links from the top of the page. 4.6 Incorporating query information So far, note that all our features depend only on the extraction predicate z and not the input query x . Remarkably, we were still able to obtain rea-sonable results. One explanation is that since we obtained the web pages from a search engine, the most prominent entities on the web pages, such as entities in table cells in the middle of the page, are likely to be good independent of the query.

However, different queries often denote enti-ties with different linguistic properties. For exam-ple, queries mayors of Chicago and universities in Chicago will produce entities of different lengths, part-of-speech sequences, and word distributions. This suggests incorporating features that depend on the query.

To explore the potential of query informa-tion, we conduct the following oracle experi-ment. We replace each denotation feature f ( y ) with a corresponding query-denotation feature ( f ( y ) ,g ( x )) , where g ( x ) is the category of the query x . We manually classified all queries in our dataset into 7 categories: person, media title, loca-tion/organization, abtract entity, word/phrase, ob-ject name, and miscellaneous.

Table 8 shows some examples where adding these query-denotation features improves the se-lected entity lists by favoring answers that are more suitable to the query category. However, Ta-ble 6 shows that these new features do not signifi-cantly improve the accuracy of our original system on the development data.

We suspect that any gains offered by the query-denotation features are subsumed by the structural features. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two experiments, the results of which are shown in Table 6. First, we removed structural features and found that using query-denotation features im-proves accuracy significantly over using denota-tion features alone from 19.8% to 25.0%. Second, we created a modified dataset where the web page in each example is a concatenation of the orig-inal web page and an unrelated web page. On this modified dataset, the prominent entities may not be the answers to the query. Here, query-denotation features improves accuracy over deno-tation features alone from 19.3% to 29.2%. 4.7 Comparison with other problem settings Since zero-shot entity extraction is a new task, we cannot directly compare our system with other systems. However, we can mimic the settings of other tasks. In one experiment, we augment each input query with a single seed entity (the second annotated entity in our experiments); this setting is suggestive of Wang and Cohen (2009). Table 6 shows that this augmentation increases accuracy from 41.1% to 52.9%, suggesting that our sys-tem can perform substantially better with a small amount of additional supervision. Our work shares a base with the wrapper induc-tion literature (Kushmerick, 1997) in that it lever-ages regularities of web page structures. However, wrapper induction usually focuses on a small set of web domains, where the web pages in each do-main follow a fixed template (Muslea et al., 2001; Crescenzi et al., 2001; Cohen et al., 2002; Arasu and Garcia-Molina, 2003). Later work in web data extraction attempts to generalize across different web pages, but relies on either restricted data for-mats (Wong et al., 2009) or prior knowledge of web page structures with respect to the type of data to extract (Zhang et al., 2013).

In our case, we only have the natural language query, which presents the more difficult problem of associating the entity class in the query (e.g., hiking trails ) to concrete entities (e.g., Avalon Su-per Loop ). In contrast to information extraction systems that extract homogeneous records from web pages (Liu et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2009), our system must choose the correct field from each record and also identify the relevant part of the page based on the query.

Another related line of work is information ex-traction from text, which relies on natural lan-guage patterns to extract categories and relations of entities. One classic example is Hearst pat-terns (Hearst, 1992; Etzioni et al., 2005), which can learn new entities and extraction patterns from seed examples. More recent approaches also leverage semi-structured data to obtain more ro-bust extraction patterns (Mintz et al., 2009; Hoff-mann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012; Riedel et al., 2013). Although our work focuses on semi-structured web pages rather than raw text, we use linguistic patterns of queries and entities as a sig-nal for extracting appropriate answers.

Additionally, our efforts can be viewed as build-ing a lexicon on the fly. In recent years, there has been a drive to scale semantic parsing to large databases such as Freebase (Cai and Yates, 2013; Berant et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013). However, despite the best efforts of information extraction, such databases will always lag behind the open web. For example, Berant et al. (2013) found that less than 10% of naturally occurring questions are answerable by a simple Freebase query. By using the semi-structured data from the web as a knowledge base, we hope to increase fact coverage for semantic parsing.

Finally, as pointed out in the error analysis, we need to filter or aggregate the selected entities for complex queries (e.g., tech companies in China for a web page with all Asian tech companies). In fu-ture work, we would like to explore the issue of compositionality in queries by aligning linguistic structures in natural language with the relative po-sition of entities on web pages.
