 Weibo is one of the most popular social media which enjoys a rapid develop-ment in China. People can freely express their opinion, attitude and emotion with it. According to a report released by China Internet Network Information Center(CNNIC)[1], the quantity of Weibo users totaled 204 million and nearly half of the weibo X  X  updates are sent via mobile phone. Recent trends in Weibo X  X  development have led to a proliferation of studies on social media analysis. A well-designed, fine-grained and large-scale annotated corpus can be benefit to lots of research and applications of social media sentiment analysis.
 have made some progress. Based on Twitter data, Pak et al.[8] established a subjective corpus containing positive and negative sentiment text. Ptaszynski et al.[9] builded a corpus based on a large-scale Japanese blogs, they labeled both sentiment and emotion including sentiment polarity and emotion icon. In Jacob X  X  study[4], a CRF-based model which can effectively reduce human workload was adopted to extract expressions of opinion object to build an object dictionary in interdisciplinary datasets.
 notated corpus. Xu et al.[13] labeled nearly 40,000 sentences with sentiment polarity based on Chinese textbooks for primary schools, screenplays and liter-ature periodicals. After analysing characteristics of the annotated corpus with million-words level, some statistical results like the distribution of sentiment and its transfer pattern was given in their study. Based on this research, they designed an framework for product reviews labelling, and annotated the attributions of product and their corresponding opinion expressions in word-level, sentence-level and document-level respectively[14]. For entity-level labelling, Deng et al.[3] have published an entity-level corpus named MPQA3.0, they annotated entities and event targets on the basis of previous work. Dai et al.[2] annotated 5,000 reviews of product with opinion object and sentiment polarity, they also labelled some implicit sentiment, default object and polarity transfer. But on the one hand their corpus suffered from the lack of hierarchy relationship between opinion objects and attributes, on the other hand the product reviews are not much di-versity comparing to Weibo data. Recent developments of Weibo have heightened the need for social media oriented annotated corpus. Yao et al.[15] established a emotion annotated corpus contains 14,000 pieces of weibo and 45,431 sentences. They labelled the sentences with 7 kinds of emotion class and 3 kinds of emotion strength.
 media oriented annotation and its corresponding specifications. Compared to other resource construction method, our framework can effectively reduce the manual work by using the classifier and automatic aspect extraction method as the initial labelling and assistance. Besides, a random cross-validation process is introduced to minimize the difference of human cognition. Using the framework, we complete a sentence-level opinion corpus X  X  annotation which contains 15,679 pieces of weibo, 20,154 sentences, and a hierarchical aspect-level opinion corpus with 13,787 sentences, 24,093 pairs of triples annotated. We also annotate a part of sentences containing implicit opinions. Moreover, we present a set of evaluation methods for the task of fine-grained opinion aspect extraction. These methods have been used in the fifth to seventh Chinese Opinion Analysis Evaluation[11, 12, 6].
 cations in the next section. The main process of annotation will be described in section 3 and a detail analysis of the corpus will be given in section 4. We then present the method and indexes of evaluation in section 5. The sixth part shows the result and analysis of Chinese Opinion Analysis Evaluation 2015 which used the corpus as task dataset. Conclusion and future work are presented in the last section. 2.1 Granularity of annotation The authors of Weibo express their opinions or emotions with brief words. These sentences usually contain dense opinions or emotions but suffered from ill-formed expression. Therefore, a large-scale corpus with detailed, fine-grained annotation plays a important role for social media oriented research. In this paper, we choose sentence-level as the basic granularity of annotation, then a hierarchical aspect-level annotation of triples &lt; object, attribute, polarity &gt; will be done on the set of sentences which contain opinions 2.2 Annotation of implicit opinion The expressions of opinion in Weibo text are consist of explicit and implicit ones. Explicit opinion refer to the phrase or sentence express sentiment polarity with sentiment words which can be effectively identified through a sentiment dictionary, while the implicit ones are made up without sentiment words. Liu[7] defined the implicit opinion as a kind of objective statement contains the gen-eral opinion or comparative one which express a subjective feeling of satisfy or unsatisfy. Usually, there are two ways for expressing implicit opinion, namely factual description based and rhetorical description based. For example. while the second one is metaphorical.
 sentences which collected from a famous car reviews website named Autohome ? in China, nearly one third of the sentences contain implicit expression. Implicit sentiment words, and most of the current research has focused on explicit opin-ions[7]. For that reason, we add the labelling of implicit opinion into our corpus for related research in the future. 2.3 Classification of annotated opinion In this paper, we focus in annotating the sentiment polarity of sentences and triples, and the explicit/implicit class of opinion sentence. We define the classi-fication of annotation as the following table 1. 3.1 Selection of original data and preprocessing We use a dataset with 10 million weibos which was crawled from the largest and most popular social media named Weibo in China as the original data. This dataset was also used as task data for new sentiment word identification in COAE2014[12]. Comparing to other source, the Weibo dataset is domain inde-pendent which covers a wide coverage such as digital product, cars review, food, travel, entertainment and so on. Moreover, a large number of weibos X  contents are suffered from arbitrary and ill-formed expression. Therefore, cleaning and preprocessing of the original data need to be finished firstly to reduce the noise. It is consist of two steps.
 rule-based filter to finish this task. The rules mainly includes, 1)weibos with the length less than 10 Chinese characters; 2)all emoticons or punctuation composed ones; 3)the ones containing mobile phone number or QQ(a famous IM software in China) number, because this kind of weibos are mostly advertisement; 4)com-pletely duplicate ones.
 of annotation. For that reason, we segment all the weibos into sentences by using the following rules. 1)split the weibo by the segment characters set S = {  X . X ,  X  "  X ,  X ! X ,  X ? X ,  X : X ,  X . . .  X  } ; 2)if the period( " ) or dot(.) is between two numbers or characters, skip the segment process for it is usually means a number or abbreviation; 3)preserve the first sentence only if it follows with repeating segment characters in S . 3.2 Process of annotation The main process of annotation in this paper is consist of two stages. Firstly, in the sentence-level opinion annotate stage, we use a dictionary-based opinion sentence identification method proposed in Song X  X  research[10] to select candi-date opinion sentences, then send the filtered result to annotators for manual annotation and cross validation. Then we adopt the method proposed by Liao[5] to extract opinion aspect pairs on the selected opinion sentences in stage 1. This pairs can be used as a initial labelling and reference for annotators in aspect-level triplet annotate stage, and a cross validation for consistency is completed after that. The framework of annotate process is shown as the following figure 1. Annotation of opinion sentence In this stage, we distinguish the opinion sentences from the dataset and annotate sentiment polarity label. Compared to previous work, we add the annotation of implicit opinion. The basic rules for labelling are defined as, if the sentence which contains opinion has explicit sentiment words, we consider it as a explicit opinion sentence and label the corresponding polarity. While a sentence will be regarded as implicit opinion one if the containing opinion is expressed by factual description or rhetorical description like metaphor and personification.
 will be marked as a explicit negative sentence for it has an explicit sentiment word /  X  P 0 (Ceezy). While the sentence / \M  X  ;  X  Y  X   X  3 , H  X   X  iphone  X  0 (How stupid are you buying an iPhone on south Taisheng road.) expresses a negative opinion using a metaphor / M  X  ;  X  Y 0 (stupid like the head is crashed by a door).
 Annotation of opinion triplet In the fine-grained opinion aspect triplet anno-tate stage, we try to extract all the opinion triplets &lt; object, attribute, polarity &gt; in the opinion sentences. During the annotation, we define a set of rules in order to achieve a clear, complete, high-consistency result. The rules are defined as follows.
 each other with hyphenation  X   X   X  or  X  !  X  will be regarded as a whole aspect. While the aspects concatenated by conjunction  X   X   X  or  X   X   X (both means  X  X nd X  in Chinese) are divided into different triplets.
  X   X d  X   X  5 7 ,  X  5  X  |  X   X   X  O !  X   X  ! M # "0 (Apple, Samsung earned 99% profits of the global mobile phone market. The price re-ducing of domestic cellphone without limit will result in cut-throat competition inevitably, let alone quality, innovation.) 3 u A X  X   X   X  ^ 5  X  U  X  5 A O  X  ! 0 (I used the MOTOROLA series A from the end of 2002 to October 2010 for the reason that each generation of series A enjoyed an excellent usability and continuity.) triplets in pairs and the polarity of them depend on the result of comparison.  X   X  '  X  C r "0 (I tried the new PASSAT today, feel better than MAGOTAN, at least the power system and noise reduction are better than its.) aspect, we preserve the longest range.

  X  3 { I  X   X   X   X   X   X   X  F  X  u  X  "0 (#New Cars Boardcasting#Now, the Volvo s60 2013 is available, this car achieved the best in a evaluation in US and defeat other German and Japanese premium cars overwhelmingly.) means the aspect is default in current sentence.
 Consistency of annotation The annotation of corpus needs collaboratively work. The result of labelling of different annotator is unavoidable different. We design the following process try to reduce the inconsistency.
 tors set as H, the annotator X  X  labelling can be marked as L ( s,h ), s  X  S , h  X  H , L (  X  ) = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 } .
 in S uk , an annotator labels the sentiment polarity. After that, we get an initial S lk . Integrate the subset by S l = S l  X  ( S lk  X  S be abandoned for it is hardly to get an agreement. Then add the rest subset to labelled set by S l = S l  X  ( S d /S 0 d ).
 unlabelled set S u in current stage. Similarly, divide S u into k groups, and get the S uk ,h  X  H } , triple ( s ki ,h ) means the opinion aspect triple &lt; object, attribute, polarity &gt; . S We have completed a corpus with 15,679 weibos, 20,154 sentences which covers a wide range such as automobile, electronics, mobile phone, food, entertainmen-t and so on. Among the opinion sentences, we annotate 13,787 sentences with 24,093 pairs of opinion aspect triplets. A detail analysis like sentiment distribu-tion, explicit/implicit proportion, lexical diversity will be shown as follows. 4.1 Sentiment distribution of opinion in sentences and aspects The statistical result of sentiment distribution of opinion in sentences and aspect triplets is shown as the following table 3. positive from table 3. However, users prefer to express negative or mixed opinion through implicit expression. This phenomenon is in accordance with the general cognitive pattern that people will speak highly of others directly, while a more euphemistic tone will be adopted when delivering criticism or alternative view-points. In consideration of the proportion of opinion aspect triplets, comparing to sentence-level opinion, triplets express more certain sentiment polarity with less mixed opinion ones, for the triplet enjoyed a finer granularity. This can be somehow a support for the idea that aspect-level fine-grained opinion expressions can accurately portray the sentiment information of a document. 4.2 Analysis of lexical diversity in fine-grained opinions The lexical diversity can effectively describe the coverage and generalization of the corpus in fine-grained aspect annotation. The analysis of lexical diversity is shown as table 4.
 ical diversity of implicit is more abundant then explicit for the reason that, 1)it has a less average word frequency(2 . 70 &lt; 4 . 22); 2)each opinion attribute in im-plicit triplets corresponds 1.71(803 / 468) objects while the ratio is 1.39(4598 / 3306) in explicit ones. 4.3 Analysis of consistency Consistency of opinion sentence annotation. We introduce the  X  -coefficient to measure the consistency of opinion sentence annotation. For the labelling of 11 annotators, we calculate the  X  value on total, explicit, implicit opinion re-spectively. The result and analysis is given as follows, see table 5.
 a low performance in implicit ones. The reason is that there is no clear definition of implicit expression in linguistics, we only set a few rough rules to restrict it to a wide range, so the annotators have to identify the ambiguous concept from their own cognition.
 Consistency of fine-grained aspect triplets annotation. To measure the consistency of this stage, We use the evaluation method mentioned in section 5, regarding the initial labelled result as testing set S t and the second validated result as key set S k . Calculate the index value of fully match and fuzzy match respectively. The result is shown as following table 6. The  X  X ll fully/fuzzy X  means the opinion object and attribute of instance in testing set must fully/fuzzy match the corresponding item of key instance at the same time and their sentiment polarity is the same. Namely, O t matches O k , A t matches A k and P t = P k , O t matches O k and P t = P k .  X  X ttribute fully/fuzzy X  means A t matches A k and P annotation is hardly satisfied, the main problem is the different cognition on the hierarchical relation between objects and attributes, the boundary of aspects and so on. To evaluate the performance of fine-grained opinion extraction system, we design two match patterns, namely fully match and fuzzy match on three evaluate target as opinion object-polarity, opinion attribute-polarity, object-attribute-polarity using the indexes of precision, recall and F1. Denote the extracted aspect in testing set S t as x , the human labelled aspect in key set S k as y , the corre-sponding sentiment polarity as P t , P k respectively, some definition is shown as follows.

 matches y .
 the testing aspect is  X   X  4  X (screen) or  X   X  E  X   X (resolution), it is not considered as fuzzy match but a fully one.
 and y greater than threshold, then x matches y . Coverage is defined as, The threshold of coverage is usually set as 0 . 2, 0 . 5 or 0 . 8 ?? . the testing aspect is  X   X  4  X (screen) and current threshold is 0.2, then the cov-erage value of this instance is 0.4 and it is regarded as a valid match. Part of the corpus established in this paper was used as the task data for so-cial media oriented opinion analysis, including opinion sentence identification and opinion aspects extraction in the seventh Chinese opinion analysis evalua-tion(COAE2015). Unlike previous evaluation, there are two type of evaluation on each task this year, namely resource limited and resource unlimited. The former focus on the proposed methods and models by limit the using of unof-ficial resources, while the focal point of the latter is the performance of each participating system. 6.1 Result of opinion sentence identification and classification There are 19 teams with 44 results submitted in this task. 13 teams with 18 submissions are resource limited while the number of unlimited is 15 and 26. We list the best and medium result of all the submissions in following table 7. mong the submissions. From table 7 we can know that, 1)on the task of Chinese opinion sentence identification, most teams achieve a acceptable performance but still need to improve on mixed opinion sentences. This kind of data usual-ly contains both positive and negative opinions which is hard to be recognized correctly. 2)Compared with limited resource evaluation, there is only a 4% im-provement in average of the unlimited resource. In some sense, it demonstrates that only adding extra resource will hardly work when dealing with social media text. 6.2 Result of opinion aspects extraction The number of participating teams in this task is much less than the previous one, however the aspect extraction is harder and more meaningful for a fine-grained opinion analysis will accurately portray short text like the social media data. There are 10 teams with 20 results submitted and 5 teams with 6 sub-missions are resource limited. 15 unlimited results were submitted by 9 teams. Results can be seen in the following table 8.
 mance of this year decreased 10% in average, using Weibo data which is domain independent instead of some product BBS may be the main reason. mixed opinions needs improving. However, the result is still acceptable for there is only 1.47% of the triplets containing mixed opinion in aspect-level granularity. answers reached an agreement by more than three teams. This phenomenon demonstrates that there exists great difference among the teams. average. For social media oriented data, we shall lie our focal point on models and representation. In this paper, we design a framework for fine-grained, hierarchical, social media oriented labelling and its corresponding specifications. We complete a sentence-level opinion corpus X  X  annotation which contains 15,679 pieces of weibo, 20,154 sentences including explicit or implicit opinions. In addition, a hierarchical aspect-level opinion corpus with 13,787 sentences, 24,093 pairs of triples are established for aspect-level sentiment analysis. A dataset based on our labelled corpus was used as a task dataset in COAE2015 and effectively promote the development of related research on social media sentiment analysis. This dataset is now avail-able on the website(http://115.24.12.5/web/resource.html) for academia. In fu-ture work, we will build a larger and more detailed corpus for implicit sentiment analysis.
