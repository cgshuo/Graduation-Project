 This paper reports from a field st udy of a hospital ward and dis-cusses how people achieve coordination through the use of a wide range of interrelated non-digital artifacts, like whiteboards, work schedules , exam ination s heets , care records , pos t-it notes etc. These artifacts have m ultiple roles and functions which in com bi-nation facilitate location awaren ess, continuous coordination, cooperative planning and status overview. We described how actors achieve coordination by us ing different aspects of these artifacts: their material qualities, the structure they provide as templates and the signs inscribed upon them that are only mean-ingful to knowledgeable actors. We finally discuss the implication for the design of CSCW tools from the study . H.0 [Information sy stems] Design, Human Factors Artifacts, collaboration, cooperative work, healthcare, pervasive computing. In this article we attempt to achieve a better understanding of how collaborative work is accom plished by actors through the inter-weaving of interrelated practices and m ultiple coordinative arti-facts. Whereas a number of previous studies have focused on single artifacts (e.g. [12, 26] ), we want to explore more how mul-tiple coordinative artifacts are interwoven into a web of artifacts by actors when accom plishing their work (an interes t we s hare with e.g. [21] ). We base our argument on an ethnographic study of a hospital ward which we think can be especially beneficial for the study of collaborative work, becaus e the hos pital ward s imultaneous ly dis play s characteris tics of the intens e, collocated collaboration of e.g. control rooms (e.g. [8] ) and the low intensity , distributed work s ettings of e.g. a was tewater plant (e.g. [5] ). Social &amp; Health care assistants (SHA), nurs es and phy sicians at the ward continu-ous ly shift between being engaged in face-to-face collaboration and distributed collaboration where they cannot see nor talk to each other but have to com municate via m essages and notifica-tions. In som e situations, instan t and precise action is required, whereas in other situations the work process is slow. Another characteristic of the hospital wa rd is simultaneous ubiquity of plans and procedures and ad hoc coordination due to ever arising contingencies. A plethora of coor dinative artifacts , such as white-boards, plans, schemes, proce dures and templates designed to provide order to and coordinate the m ultiple work processes are present at the hospital ward, but working at the hospital ward is never routine. We want to understand how health care personnel achieve their work, which is characterized by a m ix of co-located and dis trib-uted work and of procedure and contingency at the same time, and we hope that this can contribute to a better understanding of collaborative work and to the design of computer support for such w ork. We focus es pecially on 1) the m aterial characteris tics of thes e artifacts, 2) on how they order the world by providing templates, 3) on how they provide overview and signal ad hoc status, 4) on the importance of acknowle dging the importance of meaning in collaboration, and finally 5) on the importance of supporting sec-ond order articulation work. We will proceed by outlining our theoretical fram ework for un-derstanding collaborative work and collaborative artifacts (section 2), describe practices and artifacts at the hospital ward (section 3), dis cuss what the artifacts enable (s ection 4), and how they do this in their m aterial and conceptual form (s ection 5). We proceed to point at the importance of mean ing and second order articulation work (section 6) and unfold the design implications of our case (section 7). Section 8 summarizes the findings. A salient feature of collaborative work in m any settings is the pres ence of a wide range of coordinative artifacts that enable actors to coordinate their activities and get an overview of the state of a work process. For exam ple, lists of activities to be done which are marked by check m arks whenever accom plished, pro-cedures that describe in which order to perform tasks and tem-plates that provide categories through which to order the world and hence provide a structure to the evolving activities. amount of  X  X rticulation work X  need ed to achieve an alignment of the various actions of actors.  X  X rtic ulation work X  [23] is the effort of coordination tasks and res ponsibilities between distributed collaborators, and can be lessene d by developing divisions of work, routines, conventions and by the use of artifacts such as schedules, plans and schema. Most collaborative settings of som e complexity display work practices ordered through e.g. divisions of work and routines and linked to various coordinative artifacts. In addition to such establishe d  X  X oordination mechanisms X  [20] , actors often in addition to this  X  X irst order X  articulation work ongo-ingly have to coordinate their wo rk, s ince the es tablis hed mecha-nism s of coordination often cannot take into account any contin-gency that may aris e: whereas some work proces s can be s ub-jected thoroughly to work flow order or even automated (e.g. the tay loristic work processes of ch emical plants), other kinds of work processes cannot. Providing health care for patients at a hospital, for example, involves kinds of complex collaboration between multiple actors and departm ents that cannot be subjected to routines and procedures entir ely . Hence  X  X econd order X  articula-tion work has to be carried out ongoingly in the course of work [19: p28] which in addition to ad hoc coordinative talking m ay be achieved through m utual awareness of the activities of colleagues [8, 9, 18] . Understanding collaborative work hence implies understanding how people achieve their work by the integration of material and im material mechanis ms of coordi nation, i.e. coordinative artifacts and divisions of work, and furthermore how people ongoingly achieve coordination of their work. A central prem ise in such an understanding is that people act on the basis on meaning and that hence the understanding of collaborative work: whereas the envi-ronment of actors may provide huge amounts of data, it is only by becom ing meaningful that data becom es inform ation. As we will show, this has im plications for how action, artifacts and actors interrelate. In particular, it has im plication for how awareness can be produced and not be produced. Our focus in this paper is on how m ultiple coordinative artifacts form a network, which comprises an  X  X rdering sy stem X  [21] , and which is used in a hospital ward by nurses to achieve their work, e.g. provision of care and treatment to patients at the ward. As organizations, hospitals have over the last 100 y ears developed as spatially and tem porally highly differentiated spaces organized around the tasks of providing diagnosis, care and treatm ent to ill people. In parallel to differentiation of s pace into places for ad-ministration, examinations, patient s, m edicine, etc., an extens ive array of coordinative mechanisms have developed: elaborate divi-sions of work between specialized professions (e.g. phy sicians, nurses, laboratorians. porters and their numerous sub-specializations ), procedures (e.g. allocations of patients to particu-lar departm ents according to diagnos is) and an array of coordina-tive artifacts (On work at hospitals in general, see [24] ). Seen from the trajectory of the individual patient, documentation of diagnosis and planning of care and treatment is primarily articu-lated through the patient record and the care record. The patient record is primarily used by phy sicians for the documentation and accum ulation of inform ation about the patient X  X  disease, present cord, see [4] ). The care-record on the other hand is used by nurses and SHAs to docum ent and accum ulate inform ation on diagnosis, treatm ent and evaluation of s pecific care-problem s and the pa-tient X  X  overall well-being. Booking sy stems, work schedules, procedures etc. form an inte-grated part of this prim ary artic ulation of collaborative work at hospitals in order to align work trajectories and coordinate within and between wards. This articul ation work, however, is com pli-cated by the fact that new events cons tantly force hos pital s taff to re-schedule: staff m embers becom e ill; patients get worse or bet-ter than expected, technology breaks down, other work trajecto-ries becom e delay ed, etc. As a consequence re-planning has con-stantly to be done. Our focus here is upon the fine-grained coordination of collabora-tive and dis tributed work as it takes place within a single ward. The ward in question is part of a departm ent s pecialized in hem a-tology (i.e. blood diseases). It normally attends to 24 patients and the staff is divided into two team s, which split the ward X  X  work-load and patients between them . Each team cons ists of phy sicians , nurses and SHAs. SHAs do much th e same work as nurses, but are, for example, not allowed to administer intravenous medicine. One of the authors conducted ethnographic fieldwork at the ward fieldwork observation was carried out. During the fieldwork ex-tensive notes were taken by hand and written out in prose the same day or the day after. At th e conclusion of the fieldwork, 12 interviews lasting 1 hour each with nurses (8), SHAs (2), and phy sicians (2) were made. The interviews were based on open-ended questions with regards to the planning and coordination of hospital work. The other author has conducted extensive field-work at the sam e hospital. As a work arrangem ent, the ward is peoplewis e characterized by the general division of work at the hospital (phy sicians, nurses, SHAs , secretaries , porters etc.) and the divis ion into two team s taking care of each their 12 patients . Spatially , the ward is divided into room s for patients, an office for secretaries , two room s for the two teams taking care of patients; rooms for medicine, for utensils and for hospital clothing and linen; and for private hy giene. Temporally the ward X  X  work a rrangement is based on nurses operating on a three shift basis (day , evening and night shift) and phy sicians on a two shift basis (day shift, on duty shift), and treatment and care of patients has to be achieved across these different shifts of people. In the daily work, a vast and complex amount of coordination, planning, s cheduling and s tatus -m aking takes place: patients have to be washed, given medicine, ta ken for radiology examinations, have blood-samples take n, given extra blood, chemotherapy must be set up and taken down, etc. It is not just that these tasks have to be carried out, but also that they need to be coordinated between other activities, patients, different professions, and working shifts. While the patient and care records are invaluable tools for the long-term coordination of hospital work around the patient, they are less im portant for this daily , short-term coordination of work between staff. Here a num ber of com plem entary artifacts are used. Figure 2 illustrates these: two different kinds of white-boards; a  X  X ork schedule X ; the ex aminations sheet; personal notes; and post-it notes. In combination these artifacts support handing over information about the location of patients and staff, creation of overviews, sy nchronous and fine-grained coordination, and articulation of status. The  X  work sc he dule  X  (figure 3 below) consists of two A4-size sheets of paper, which horizonta lly cover the nurses X  and SHAs X  three working-shifts (evening-, night-and day -shift, i.e. 24 hours starting from 4pm every day ), and vertically list the team  X  X  pa-tients and their respective bed-num ber. In the header the nam es and working hours of nurses and SHAs of the day in question are written into pre-printed colum ns, and the header thus provides a tem plate for getting an overview of the available s taff. Next to the name of a patient, the attending nur se and a detailed list of tasks, observations, examinations and othe r things that should be taken taken care of and their pres ent s tate. In the m orning the s chedule is used to note the morning X  X  measurements of blood pressure, tem perature and puls e. The work s chedule is either located in the team room or on the round-trolley . All nurses and SHAs may make entries upon it. The team room X  X  w hiteboard is 1 by 1.5 meters large and bolted to the wall in both team rooms. Like the work schedule, the whiteboard in the team room indi cates the patients X  room and bed num ber, the patients X  nam es, wh ich nurse or SHA will take care of her/him that day , and the patie nt X  X  hy giene regime. In addition which the team -leader (alway s a nurs e) thinks the phy sician should take the patients during the round is indicated. Finally there is space for writing notes on major events that are due, for exam ple  X  X-ray 10am  X  or  X  hom e F riday  X . The ward office X  X  w hiteb oard is 1 by 2 meters large and bolted wards 24 patients, their actual r oom and bed number, their hy -giene-regime and which nurse take s care of the patient. It is up-dated by the doctor X  X  secretaries , the team -leaders and the head-nurse. Upon the examination sheets all exam inations and sam ples pre-scribed by the phy sician and their pres ent s tatus are regis tered; (i) are they to be ordered, (ii) have they been ordered, (iii) have they been taken, and (iv) have the re sults com e back y et? Nurs es as well as SHAs m ake entries when pres criptions are m ade by the phy sicians and they are located with the care-records or on the round-trolley . Post-it notes are us ed by the phy sician and the team -leader m ak-ing the m orning round for writing up new tasks, prescriptions or examinations whose implementation should be handed over im-mediately . They will either put on the whiteboard in the team room next to the patient X  X  name or given to the nurse or SHAs taking care of the patient. Personal notes are kept by almost all phy sicians, nurses and SHAs to list their respective patients (including name, bed-number and hy giene regime) and task s that have to be taken care of. These are individual notes that are kept in the staff X  X  own pocket and are usually not shared with others. At a first glance there seems to be a redundancy of information within this sy stem of artifacts. For example, information about a patient X  X  room and bed number, associated nurs e, and hy giene regim e is repeated on the works -schedule, all the whiteboards and the personal notes. Similarly , ex aminations and giving of blood and chemotherapy are listed on the work schedule, the whiteboard in the team room , on the exam ination-sheets and possibly on the individual notes. There are, however , also some slight, but impor-tant differences in inform ation and the phy sicality of these arti-facts. Work schedules can be carried around and have a high de-gree of detailed inform ation, whereas the whiteboards are large, bolted to the wall and carry com paratively little inform ation. The examination-card is mobile and has detailed information on ex-aminations also found on the work schedule. These differences reflect differences in the com bination of purpos es they serve. These purposes, we suggest, can be grouped into considerations of producing overviews, viewing data differently , revealing status, planning of cooperation, continuous coordination, and passing on messages and notificati ons, as well as providing indi-vidual work-s paces . All of the above artifacts serve the purpose of providing care-staff overview, but of different kinds . Starting from the most general level the whiteboard in the secretaries X  office gives an overview of how m any patients are adm itted at the ward at present, their location, their as sociated nurs e and their hy giene regim e. This provides secretaries information they often need when giving directions to visitors and staff from other wards . The s ecretaries can tell where to find a patient, which nurse to talk to about the patient X  X  pres ent s tate, and where to find the nurs e, since she probably is with or close to the pa tient. In addition, the s ecretaries can advise as to whether the visitors need to put on masks, white-coats becaus e of special hy giene precautions . The ward X  X  head nurse furthermore uses this wh iteboard to acquire an overview when allocating beds to newly ad mitted patients and has to solve the puzzle of making requirement of single-sex rooms, hy giene regimes and personal situation meet. The whiteboards in the team room s carry the sam e inform ation and s erve, on team -bas is, the same overviews. In addition, how-ever, they have information on the order in which patients are taken in the phy sician X  X  morning round (from 9-12.30 pm), on the patients X  particular disease and on the main points on the patients X  schedule. This helps locate patie nts ( X  X he X  X  off for X-ray  X ) and staff, s ince the latter can be as sumed to be engaged with one of the tasks listed for the patient, if not actually close to the patient. The round-order where patients are marked when attended to furtherm ore makes it eas ier to locate the phy sician, whos e deci-sion and advice is often needed. During the day , a nurse or SHA will often open the door and take a few steps into the team room (or the office), cas t a quick glance at the whiteboard and hurry on. She gets within a second, the information she wants from the whiteboard on the wall. The information on the work schedule also enables location-facilitation, but since it is carried around with the m orning round and its writi ng is sm all, it is not as acces-sible as the whiteboards . Characteris tically , thes e whiteboard are only updated during the morning shift and not during the other shifts where staff is less and the work schedule is available. The main planning artifact in each team is obviously the work schedule. In the morning the team -leader can as sign nurs es and SHAs to their respective patients based on the inform ation on the work schedule about the staff X  X  individual working hours and on the attention individual patients and their as sociated tas ks. In the assignm ent, the team -leader als o takes into cons ideration the com petencies and experience of individual nurses and SHAs. While the work schedule enables cooperative planning at the level of the team, the examination-sh eet enables cooperative planning from the perspective of the individual patient. The examination-sheet gives information on which tests, checks and portions of blood are due, and thus information on when and where the pa-tient should be on respective day s. This information is also pro-vided by the work schedule and the whiteboard in the team room, but whereas these only cover the next twenty -four hours, maxi-mum, the exam ination-s heet provi des an overview up to several weeks or months. Finally , cooperative planning is also carried out on the whiteboard in the office by the head nurse when she assigns newly adm itted patients to their beds, and on the whiteboard in the team room s, when the team -leader num bers the team  X  X  patients in the order in which she thinks the phy sicians should take his round (figure 3). The phy sician and the team-leader, who make the round, thus in a glance know which patients will be due next and m ay therefore arrange journals accordingly . This order, however, als o serves as continuous planning , to which we will pay attention below. 
Figure 4. Cooperative Planning a nd Continuous Coor dina-Once the m orning conference is over, the nurs es and SHAs en-During the day , however, there is a need for continuously coordi-nating tas ks, since some res ources are s carce (e.g. pum ps that infuse chemotherapy ) and since some tas ks need to be carried out in a specific order. Thus , while chem otherapy m ay already be prescribed for the day , it cannot be commenced before the results of a blood-sample from the patient in question have been returned and acknowledge by a phy sician. Si milarly , patients will not be taken for a shower if the phy sician X  X  round is imminent. Other tasks, like the giving of blood and chemotherapy requires two nurses, since the procedures prescribes double checking of infor-mation to make sure that patients are given the right blood or that the doses of chemo-pharmaceuticals have been calculated cor-rectly. This kind of continuous coordinati on relies, of course, to a large extent on verbal communication, but since the staff is spread out and locating specific persons takes an effort, the network of arti-facts is also applied. Informa tion on approximately when the phy-sician X  X  round will get to a certain patient can be gathered from the order written on the whiteboard in the team rooms (figure 3). Especially, since numbers in the order are erased as patients have been seen to. A more detailed, continuous planning is enabled by the list of tasks on the work schedule, which enables the staff to get an overview of all important tasks that have to be taken care of within the team. This is, in particular, enhanced by the ability of the work schedule to give a status overview . Most tasks listed on the work schedule have little signs like  X   X 
Y  X  or  X  X  X  attached to them. These signs indicate the status of a single task. Thus  X  /  X  means that a task still has to be commenced,  X 
Y  X  means it has been commenced, whereas  X  X  X  indicates that the task has been completed. Many task move from  X  / away, typically if there is con tinuity between commencement and completion. The  X  Y  X  is usually applied to the giving of blood or chemotherapy, which may take between  X  hour to 6 hours, and where the staff may attend to other tasks while the fluids run into the veins. On top of having the function of a checklist, this system of little signs, enables colleagues to assess in quite some detail the status of other tasks. Especially, since the staff uses their experi-ence of the ward X  X  routines to combine the individual tasks and assigned signs into an overall picture of the situation. A similar system of signs is applied in connection with the tasks listed on the whiteboard in the t eam rooms, and on the individual notes of the staff. As mentioned previously, the whiteboa rd in the team room is used by the team-leader for putting on messages to nurses about deci-sions made by the physician during the round: i.e. decisions that imply new tasks or a revision of previous tasks. Through the notes, the team-leader can achieve continuous coordination of tasks without having to actually get hold of people. Such new tasks are also written on the work schedule, but they are more obvious when put on the whiteboard on a yellow piece of paper. Finally, the individual notes provi de nurses and physicians with what we term personal workspaces, where lists of official tasks, i.e. tasks that figure on the work schedule and personal items can be listed. The latter may include details of the official tasks or matters that arise when patients are attended to and which must be remembered. Some of the latter may be entered into the care-record, on the whiteboard or in the work schedule if they have to be handed over, whereas other items just have to be temporarily remembered and will be deleted when accomplished. The advan-tages of the individual notes are obvious: they are mobile, handle-able, and can be fitted into a pocket. They alleviate the need to go to one of the whiteboards or find the work schedule whenever a person is in doubt about tasks. As we have tried to unfold in the previous sections, the different artifacts serve multiple purposes. In different degrees and combi-nations, they serve the purpose of cooperative planning, continu-ous coordination, keeping a stat us overview, locating people, providing individual workspaces and serve as media for the pass-ing on of messages. All in all, this network of artif acts supports the staff in achieving a  X  X mooth flow of work X  [7] across contingencies. The network is a kind of  X  X ork-flow within X  in the sense of Bowers et al. and sup-ports  X  X he local and internal accomplishment of the ordering of work X  [6; p63]. Though tasks are listed and their present state marked, it is the sequencing imposed by the staff X  X  priorities that determines when what is done and not the coordination mecha-nisms nor the network. The network of artifacts operates as a resource for action and not as a model or plan that has to be ad-hered to [25]. The support that artifacts provide can be accorded to three differ-ent aspects: their materiality, the templates they provide and the linkage of real world changes to notification. As described by e.g. [11, 22], sh eets of paper have the distinct advantage of being highly mobile and handable, which the work schedules, examination-sheets and individual notes make use of because to fit these artifacts with the highly mobile hospital work [2]. In order to assist memory and to document diagnosis, care and treatment physicians and nurse s bring along patient records, care records, work schedules et c. Whiteboards on the other hand have other distinct advantages [ 26] which in this case is to pro-vide at-a-glance overview at a fixed place. Being fastened to the wall, nurses know that they can always find certain information here as opposed to looking for information in the work schedules, examination-sheets or records which move around. Large boards with relatively little detail of information provide for overviews at a glance and from a distance at a fixed place, while the detailed information of the small-sized wo rk schedules (A4-size) and indi-vidual notes (A5-size) provide an overview and status of the shift X  X  tasks. We thus go from mobility to stationary, from small to large size information boards. The different coordinative artifact s all provide templates which structure which kind of informati on it is relevant to inscribe upon them. Patient names, bed &amp; r oom number, nurse or SHA in charge of the patient has a column or entry field in almost all of the coordinative artifacts mentioned and in addition the work schedule and the whiteboards in the team rooms have entry fields for which tasks have to he carried out. This information forms the basics of work at the hospital: who (patient), where (e.g. bed-room number), whom (e.g. attending nurse or physician making the round) and what (which tasks). The why is provided by acronyms for the respective diagnosis (differentiated kinds of blood cancer) which also listed on these artifacts. This information is im portant for which kind of care and treatment particular patients receive, of course, but also implies different attitudes towards the patie nt: different kinds of diseases imply different perspectives for the patient X  X  future health and hence different kinds of attitude towards the patient from physi-cians, nurses and SHAs (this is pa rt of what [24] call  X  X wareness context X ). The how of achieving treatment is often indicated by an acronym for the kind of standard chemotherapy that has been prescribed. To the knowledgeable clinician this implies a certain rhythm since chemotherapy most often involves a series of treatments and en-tails a set of expected problems that occur at certain stages of treatment. As work progresses finalized tasks are erased and new tasks are added to the whiteboards and work schedules in accordance with the effort of achieving continuous coordination. More fine grained, the who, where, whom , what, why and how is supple-mented by notation marks ne xt to different tasks - X   X  X  X  ( X  X o do X ,  X  X n progress X  and  X  X one X  respectively) -which pro-vide the when of the work setting, and signaling that status of work and timing is of central concern at the ward. Moreover, the progress of the medical round is marked on the white boards in the team rooms by giving patients numbers according to the order in which they will be attended to and placing a check-mark when-ever a patient has been seen. It is important, however, to rea lize that while the artifacts support work through their material characteristics, the templates they provide and the linkage between notification and real work changes, work at the ward relies on a considerable amount of second order articulation work and on knowledgeable clinicians attributing meaning to the information here. While the network of coordinative artifacts provide a lot of in-formation (about who, where, w hom, what, why, how and when) clinicians still have to juggle ta sks and coordinate actions with others continuously. The coordinative artifacts provide overview and to a certain degree stipulate what has to be done, but they do this according to the single patient and single task, whereas clini-cians have to take care of severa l patients and tasks at the same time. They hence have to align tasks and work trajectories of individual patients into a coherent work trajectory for themselves and this is not taken care of by the coordinative artifacts. The artifacts mainly served as  X  X aps X  that help clinicians to get orien-tation and plan and not as  X  X cripts X  [17] that provide a step-to-step procedure along which work as a whole can be planned. In order to achieve a coherent work trajectory, clinicians rely on the coordinative artifacts described, but also to a high degree on  X  X eading X  the ward: based on knowledge upon routines and rhythms of the ward [1, 6, 13] clinicians know when is the best time to do what. By combining the information of the coordina-tive artifacts about colleagues X  tasks and  X  X eading X  the activities going on, they can also infer when is the most likely time to get hold of another clinician, e.g. in order to give blood or chemo-therapy which presupposes the attendance of two clinicians at the same time. More experience of the work at the ward enables bet-ter readings of the activities going on and make inferring more accurate, and hence lead to more effective second order articula-tion.  X  X eading the ward X  is highly connected to the fact that meaning is central to people X  X  action at all. While the net of artifacts provides a material-semiotic basis which supports work, the network and its individual artifacts are only comprehensible to people that have learned about medical work, as anyone new to a ward will experience: you know that things in your surrounding has signifi-cance, because the place is cramped with stuff, signs and texts but you do not know what it means. Newcomers may look at the whiteboard in a team room, but have a hard time working out what the inscriptions upon it means. Most often newcomers go to the secretaries X  office (which has a sign visibly designating it as such) and are guided on from there to the particular room where they have to stay or where their relative is. Only patients or rela-tives that have long-time experien ce with the ward progressively learn how to read meaning into its artifacts and activities. One implication of this is that the division between public and private spheres of information is not only secure by walls, closed doors and hushed speech, but also by the mere impossibility of being able to understand the meani ng of information. Patients and relatives may easily see the info rmation of whiteboard and even work schedules, but they will most often not be able to understand its meaning and implication. The information is most often pro-vided in acronyms (e.g. diagnosis, kind of chemotherapy, initials of attending nurse) or numbers (e .g. bed &amp; room number) or the context of the information is not known and the information is only data with no meaning. Patie nts and relatives may also see and follow the work of clinicians as it progresses, but still not understand what it means and how it fits into the work trajectories of clinicians and the ward as whole. From the above description and analysis of work at the hospital ward a number of design issues arise. The above analysis reveals how coordination of work activities at the ward is done by applying a wi de range of interwoven artifacts, which each represent important but context-specific information about the overall status of work at the ward. This can be analyzed according to the levels of the hospital, department, ward, group, and person. In a hospital, the same information is represented in numerous places across all organizational units; much of the same information is re-written on va rious whiteboards and on various paper-based schemas, schedules , plans, and personal notes. The computer as a platform is especially well suited to create a centralized data server with c lients having different views on the same pool of data and thereby decouple information from its rep-resentation [14] with less effort th an paper records that require re-writing redundant information of different artifacts. A typical information system could store su ch redundant information in one place which can be distributed and viewed in other place on dif-ferent devices. However, our analysis shows how users have different views upon the same information  X  views which are tailored to their needs, tasks, working context, and collaborative setting. The main implication from our analysis is that the exact look-and-feel of views on a shared pool of data is highly dependent on its concrete usage context. When looking at the way the different physical artifacts at the ward are used, it is striking how they are constantly adapted to the actual context. For example, the  X  X hiteboard view X  on data is tailored according to its physical placement in the of-fice, and hence to the role it plays in continuous planning and providing at-a-glance overviews, whereas the personal notes of the nurses are tailored to their specific, and more personal needs. Hence, the design of such  X  X iews X  must be made in a way to allow users to adopt it to the requireme nts of its usage context. While some of the information may be the same, the templates through which it is represented differ, because the individual nurse re-quires a different view and differe nt level of granularity on her personal notes than is feasible on e.g. the whiteboard or the work schedule. Such computerized artifacts may also be context-aware and thereby adapt to the changing working context of the clini-cian. For example, provide easy access to a patient X  X  medical data while close to this patient. Furthermore, systems need to help clinicians to  X  X ead the ward X  and to help to maintain and develop the material-semiotic linkage between coordinating artifacts and the actions taking place. This linkage is not static but devel ops continuously. Hence, new signs, abbreviations, and templates are constantly developed and old ones become obsolete. For this r eason, it is important to make plastic systems which enable users to tailor the specific views to this evolution of meaning. For example, the signs used on white-boards may change over time and new signs are needed to support the coordination of new actions. Such sign then again may need to be distributed to some of the inte rlinked artifacts, e.g. between the whiteboard and the nurses X  persona l notes. It is our impression that such a tailorable, distributed, collaborative sign systems would be beneficial in general in a hospital setting. The work of designing and engineer ing software systems are typi-cally described as one of modeling real-world objects into the computer. By using e.g. object-o riented methods the software engineer takes the objects, like th e work schedule, and  X  X uts them into the computer X  [16]. However, in this process the work sched-ule looses most of its natural usage affordances  X  like the possibil-ity to take notes on it, erase thi ngs, add post-it notes to it, mobil-ity, etc. Based on our case, revealing the interrelationships between dif-ferent artifacts, the main impli cation for design of coordination systems is to look at how the objects can be brought  X  X ut of the computer X  again, once they are put in there. It is highly relevant for a software designer to consider how a computerized work schedule can be made available in different places like the white-boards, the personal notes, the structured examination plan, etc. The computerized objects must in a sense enter the real-world again and augment existing ways of coordinating work and enable mobility, changing and adding information, etc. Our metaphor of a  X  X etwork of artifacts X  can be used to illustrate this point. If you design a system where you try to  X  X ull X  an object  X  e.g. the examination sheet  X  into the computer, you will notice that this artifact is  X  X ttached by rubber bands X  to other artifacts. As a designer, it is important to understand this interconnected nature of the artifact and design for new ways of connecting the artifact to its context. One way of doing this is to move the whole web of artifact into the digital ar ena. This however seems to be a utopian vision [10]. Thus, it is important to look for ways to link the digitalized artifact with the r eal-world ones and to even blend physical and digital  X  X aterial X  into one artifact. Linkage between the digital and the physical world is a central research theme within Pervasive Computing and Augmented Re-ality. Here physical artifacts can be linked to digital data and rep-resentation via e.g. barcodes or RFID technology. Hence, one could imagine that the work schedule (figure 3) is equipped with an RFID tag which links to a di gital counter-part in a computer-ized planning and coordination syst em. In this way, work sched-ule as a material artifact maintain it physical affordances and advantages while acting as a phy sical bookmark into the digital world and thereby providing easy access to the schedule X  X  digital representation. However, from our study we would like to point to another kind of linkage, namely the linkage between digital as well as physical representation of the same information. Much of the same information is re-represented on the various artifacts in question. Hence, there is a need for creating a design that ensures that whenever data changes in one modality, it is reflected in the other. For example, when the nurses make con tinuous planning, such changes must be reflected on all the individual work sheets  X  computerized as well as paper-based. Moreover, we find it important not only to design for the linkage between data in the two worlds, but also to design for blending the two worlds. By blending we mean that a combination of rep-resentations of data in both wo rlds together form a coherent whole. For example, consider the role of whiteboards (figure 4) in the coordination of work at the ward. When creating systems for the coordination of work, it might be essential to project the digi-tal material back onto a whiteboard type of device. An obvious candidate is a computerized whiteboard. However, we would argue that the need for having a real whiteboard might still be relevant. There are a wide range of annotations made to the white-board, that might not be relevant (or feasible) to model in a computer system. Hence, we think that projecting basic data (like patient data, medical indications, etc.) to a real whiteboards and then continue to use it as today might be a more feasible solution than to try to computerize all the different thing this whiteboard is used for. This is blending information from the two worlds be-cause it is only together the data provides the whole picture. The change from paper to computerized distribution of informa-tion often entails discussion around privacy issues, since  X  so the argument goes  X  the information can more easily be spread to more people. Thus computerizati on often implies the provision of individual login-id and passwords, and this is certainly necessary in order not to uncritically distribute information such as what is found in the records of patients. However, looking at the web of coordinative artifacts such personal logins would prevent the web to work  X  it would, for example, be rather awkward to require users to login on wall-based displays like the whiteboards since the whole point is that they are publicly available. Looking at the way things work today, privacy may not such a pertinent issue since much written information to the lay person is coded. The acronyms, abbreviati ons and terminology used are only understandable to people who know the ward. Hence, we would argue for a more relaxed privacy model where some infor-mation and some views on this info rmation may not be subject to user authentication. However, physical space has a profound im-portance in this question. To rev eal status on a whiteboard in the team room, for example, is not privacy issue exactly because it is located in the team room and viewable only there. If, on the other hand, this whiteboard was distri buted on e.g. a web page it may be accessible from outside the hospital. Therefore, we find that a security and user authentication model based on physical prox-imity is essential in setting like the hospital [3]. Hence, people at the ward may see the informati on on the whiteboards without user authentication, while people outside the hospital may not. The use of such location-tracki ng technology, then again, poses its own privacy challenges to the clinicians working at the hospi-tal. At the Eden Medical Center in California, nurses were as-signed to wear personal locator badges which allowed hospital administrators to locate them anywhere at any time. According to hospital management, the system is meant to help nurses answer patient calls faster and allow the hospital to track nurses more easily in case of emergency, but the nurses think that the badges invaded their privacy and interfere with patient care by disrupting conversations between nurses a nd patients. Accordingly, the nurses have handed in their badges [15]. One issue in systems like the one in Eden Medical Center is whether location information should be stored historically, but we did not find any need for his in this case. To support the smooth flow of work and the coordination of distributed activities the important thing to know is wher e a colleague is now and where you may expect him or her to be in the near future. Historical data on where people were a minute ago is not relevant. Another issue, however, is whether it is at all necessary to track people and hence raise the issue of surveillance in order to sup-port coordination. While centralized coordinative artifacts cer-tainly can be advantageous, they may also be highly disruptive of work. (see 7). As described above, clinicians after a while become very skilled at reading the activities going on at the ward. Conse-quently, instead of tracking people and artifacts it may be possible to provide signs that signal ac tivities in other ways: indicating through differently colored light for example how many patients and clinicians are in a room or indicating how busy secretaries are picking up phones calls. Because of the existence of centr alized coordinative artifacts at the ward already, e.g. the whiteboards, it is tempting to envision computer support by augmenting already existing artifacts and replace the whiteboard with an online, large computer-screen and, for example, display the location of clinicians on a map of the ward. This would lead into the direction of the case above and into discussions of privacy and surveillance. However, it should be recognized that the existing ne twork of coordinative artifacts is only one part of the arrangement of work which supports coordi-nation. On the one hand, the material characteristics of these arti-facts, the templates and notifications applied provide central in-sights into central concerns of the work. From these artifacts can be gathered the who, where, w hom, what, why, how and when of the work processes. On the other hand, however, clinicians still contribute with a considerable articulation work, since the infor-mation of the coordinative artifacts has the individual patients as a starting point, whereas the challenge for the clinician to achieve a coherent work trajectory across mu ltiple patients and tasks. At present this construction of a wo rk trajectory is only indirectly supported by the existing network of coordinative artifacts, which provides the information from which the clinicians can make such a construction. The whiteboards, for example, indicate which patients a particular nurse is attends to, and another nurse may hence by looking at this information and the tasks associated with these patients infer the location of her colleague: e.g. Nurse A amongst other things has to give chemotherapy to Patient 1, and since the pharmacy X  X  delivery usually arrives at 10.30, Nurse B may infer that Nurse A is most likely to be in the Flow Room (See figure 1). The clos est example of direct support for construc-tion of work trajectories are the individual notes of the clinicians that may provide a starting point for design of computer support for articulating work trajectories instead of the more visible and structured coordinative artifacts like the whiteboards and work schedule. This may, however, once again lead directly into con-troversial privacy and surveillance discussions if, for example, the information on the individual notes became centrally available. Alternatively, one should look at indirect support in form of col-ored light signaling presence and number of people or the work intensity of secretaries, as mentioned above. This paper has reported from fiel d studies of coordination and cooperation at a hospital ward. A network of highly interwoven non-electronic coordination artifacts were analyzed, showing how these artifacts play multiple roles and offer different views upon the same information while at the same time adding special fea-tures depending on context. Mobility, at-a-distance-at-a-glance overview, and easy change or adding of information was pre-sented as some of the affordances of these artifacts. These arti-facts in varying combinations function as coordinating mecha-nisms by the facilitation of (i) loca ting staff and patients, (ii) co-operative planning, (iii) continuous coordination, (iv) status over-view, (v) notification and (vi) personal workspace. We have pointed at the challenges of designing for collaborative work by discussing the relationship between information and representa-tion, how to link the physical with the digital, provide for a more relaxed privacy model based on the physical layout of hospital premises, and how to support s econd order articulation work. The Danish National Center of Information Technology (CIT) funded this research. We would lik e to thank the staff at the hos-pital ward for their warm reception of us and their forbearance with our presence and questions. [1] Bardram, J., Temporal Coordi nation.
