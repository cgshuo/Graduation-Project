 Tech Mining: Exploiting New Technologies for Competitive Advantage. By Alan L. Porter and Scott W. Cunningham, John Wiley &amp; Son, 2005, 384 pages, $84.95, ISBN 0-4714-7567-X
Tech Mining is a book about how to inform technology management by mining a wide variety of pub-licly available databases on science and technology, notably scientific publications and patents. The pri-mary aim of the book is to introduce the basic objectives and tools of tech mining. The book aims to introduce pragmatic methods for what is also known as research profiling so as to inform decision making with the  X  big picture  X  of growing technologies.

The 16-chapter book is written with two distinct groups of readers in mind, corresponding to the two-part organization of the book. The first part, consisting of Chapters 1 through 5, aims to provide concep-tual bases for practical tech mining actions, for example, how it works, what it can do, and what to watch for in tech mining. A particular emphasis is on understanding how science and technology leads to success-ful technology commercialization. This part is especially written for professionals and managers, engineers, researchers, and business analysts. The second part, from Chapter 6 to Chapter 16, is devoted to detailed descriptions of how to put tech mining in practice. This part is primarily for information scientists, patent analysts, R&amp;D managers, and strategic planners.

According to Porter and Cunningham, tech mining is the application of text mining tools to science and technology information, informed by understanding of technological innovation processes. They distin-guish tech mining from data mining and text mining by its reliance on science and technology domain knowledge to inform its practice.

The book is also sending a strong message that tech mining is an integral part of a decision-making process. Porter and Cunningham utilize Herbert Simon  X  s three-phase decision making process to delineate the practical and procedural characteristics of tech mining, namely (1) intelligence , (2) design/analysis , and (3) choice . Using the three-phase process model has the advantage of describing how tech mining ought to be done in practice and how tech mining is actually performed; it contributes greatly to the clarity of the book.

The intelligence phase is introduced in Chapters 6 X 9. In particular, Chapter 6 is on finding the right sources. Chapter 7 is on forming the right query. Chapter 8 is on getting the data. Chapter 9 is on basic analyses.
 The design and analysis phase is developed in Chapters 10 X 12. Chapter 10 is on advanced analyses. Chapter 11 is on trend analyses. Chapter 12 is on patent analyses.

The choice phase is demonstrated in Chapters 13 X 16. Chapter 13 focuses on generating and present-ing innovation indicators. Chapter 14 addresses issues concerning managing the tech mining process.
Chapter 15 discusses measuring tech mining results. Chapter 16 includes an in-depth analysis example of tech mining on fuel cells.

A nice feature of the book is the end-chapter Take-Home Messages, which summarize the key concepts and principles discussed in each chapter. The book also contains four appendix sections of valuable resources, including publication and patent databases of science and technology information, text mining software, and statistical models of text analysis. The book also includes many informative sidebars along-side the main theme.

The book has several appealing features. It provides a very accessible and practical resource for tech mining. Practitioners in business decision making, technology forecast, and science and technology indica-tor generating and monitoring will find this book an informative source. The book is well organized, which is largely benefited from the use of the three-phase decision making process model. The prose is simple, easy to read, and straight to the point. Technical contents are introduced clearly and concisely with no require-ment for any statistics or artificial intelligence background. The procedural steps are explained in such de-tail that readers could get started tech mining with a copy of the book in hand. In addition, in-depth examples such as fuel cells illustrate the objectives of tech mining and how it may improve our understand-ing of changing technologies.

The authors include numerous examples generated by a software product VantagePoint . VantagePoint is commercialized for Windows 98/NT/XP users by Search Technology Inc., where the author Alan Porter is the R&amp;D Director. VantagePoint is designed as a broadly viable software tool for technology assessment, monitoring, and forecasting using bibliographic data sources. VantagePoint includes a range of functions for scanning, profiling, mapping, trending, and forecasting. Scanning is for identifying new technologies and new uses of existing ones. Profiling is for finding key people and organizations. Mapping and decom-position tools can be used for identifying key dependency relationships among technologies. Trend analysis tools in VantagePoint facilitate the analysis of emerging technologies and underlying factors. Forecast tools allow users to project how a technology could evolve. VantagePoint is an appropriate vehicle for authors to convey details of tech mining at the operational level. The book also provides sufficient background mate-rials for readers who are interested in tech mining with other software.

In terms of what more we could expect from a book on tech mining, in addition to the very detailed fuel cells examples already in the book, I would like to see more real-world stories of tech mining in action X  both successful and failure stories, and how findings in tech mining are translated to decision making acti-vities in a real-world setting.

In summary, this is a clearly written and easy-to-read tech mining book primarily for two broad groups of readers and practitioners. To researchers and practitioners in the fields of text mining and knowledge discovery, this book presents a promising area of applications and how a diverse range of underlying information processing and management techniques could work together towards achieving an ambitious goal.
