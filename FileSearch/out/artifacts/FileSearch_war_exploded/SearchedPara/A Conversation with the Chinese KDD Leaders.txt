 In August 2012, the 18 th Annual ACM SIGKDD Conference, KDD 2012, wil l be held in Beijing, China. This is the first time for this flagship knowledge discovery and data mining conference to be held in Asia, and the second time for it to be held outside North America. As before, the KDD 2012 conference will be a central pla ce where researchers, practitioners and students from academia, business, government and industry converge to exchange the newest and most exciting ideas and results in the KDD area. Unlike previous KDD conferences, however, many new faces will be seen, n ew voices heard, and new perspectives discussed. This is particularly true because this KDD will be held in Beijing, the heartbeat of China X  X  universities, research institutes, industrial and governmental offices; the epicentre of the rapidly rising and o pening China. Over the years, we have seen a dramatic increase of interest in KDD from China, both in research and practice. Social networks, microblogging (Weibo) and online commerce have been flourishing, with user populations at hundreds of million s strong and rapidly expanding. A recent KDD related workshop held on a weekend in Beijing easily attracted more than 500 students and researchers with almost no advance notice, thanks to the rise of social media. This hunger for knowledge is rivaled on ly by the grandeur of the nation X  X  capital, as exemplified by the magnificent Great Wall, which serves as the perfect stage to host us all. Thus, the KDD 2012 conference will be a perfect bridge for East 13 of the top Chinese leaders in KDD -related academic and industrial research areas to tell us about the history of KDD in China, their own work, and their views on how KDD throughout the world can move forward. In selecting the interviewee s, we have been careful to provide a balanced view on perspectives, by choosing among scholars and researchers from machine learning, AI, databases, statistics and industrial applications. In this written interview, we have given them three questions to a nswer: Q1: What is your view on the history and important milestones of the Chinese KDD research and applications area? Q2: What is your expertise and contributions to KDD research and development? Q3: What is your view on the future of KDD, both in China and the world? Below are their answers, for which we would like to express our sincere thanks to all of them for taking their precious time to
