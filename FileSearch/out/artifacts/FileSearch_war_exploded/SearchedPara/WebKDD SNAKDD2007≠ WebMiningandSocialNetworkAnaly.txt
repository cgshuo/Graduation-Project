 In this rep ort, we summarize the con ten ts and outcomes of the recen t join t WebKDD/SNAKDD 2007 workshop on Web Mining and Social Net work Analysis that was held in con-junction with the 13th ACM SIGKDD International Confer-ence on Kno wledge Disco very and Data Mining (KDD 2007), August 12-15, 2007, in San Jose, California. In 2007, We-bKDD was organized for the nin th time in a successful series of workshops on kno wledge disco very on the Web. The rst SNA-KDD workshop is created to bring together researc hers who curren tly con tribute to di eren t asp ects of social net-work analysis, including kno wledge disco very and data min-ing in social net work, social net work mo deling, multi-agen t based social net work sim ulation, complex generic net work analysis. The join t 9th WEBKDD and 1st SNA-KDD work-shop was co-held with KDD 2007 and solicited pap ers on broad overview sub ject \W eb Mining and Social Net work Analysis". We re ect on the results of the workshop, as captured in the invited talk and presen tations.
 Web Mining, Social Net work Analysis, comm unit y disco v-ery, recommender systems WEBKDD' 07 is the 9th in a successful series of workshops on kno wledge disco very on the Web. It has built a tradition of serving as a bridge between academia and industry by bringing together practitioners and researc hers from both areas in order to foster the exc hange of ideas and the dis-semination of emerging solutions for intelligen t Web-based applications using Web usage, structure and con ten t mining. SNA-KDD' 07 is created to bring together researc hers who curren tly con tribute to di eren t asp ects of social net work analysis, including kno wledge disco very and data mining in social net work, social net work mo deling, multi-agen t based social net work sim ulation, complex generic net work analysis and other related studies that can bring inspirations or be directly applied to social net work analysis. The workshop is concerned with inter-disciplinary and cross-domain studies spanning a variet y of areas in computer science including graph and data mining, mac hine learning, computational organizational and multi-agen t studies, information extrac-tion and retriev al, and securit y, as well as other disciplines suc h as information science, and social science. The join t workshop of WEBKDD and SNA-KDD '2007 aims to bring together practitioners and researc hers with a spe-ci c focus on the emerging trends and industry needs asso-ciated with the traditional Web, the social Web, and other forms of social net working systems. The theme of the 9th WebKDD workshop and 1st SNAKDD workshop was \W eb Mining and Social Net work Analysis", encompassing lessons learned over the past years and new challenges for the years to come. This join t workshop fo-cuses on emerging trends and industry needs asso ciated with the traditional Web, the social Web, and other forms of social net working systems. The workshop solicited exp eri-men tal and theoretical work on Web mining and social net-work analysis, including (1) data mining adv ances on the disco very and analysis of comm unities, on personalization for solitary activities (lik e searc h) and social activities (lik e disco very of poten tial friends), on the analysis of user beha v-ior in open fora (lik e con ventional sites, blogs and fora) and in commercial platforms (lik e e-auctions) and on the asso ci-ated securit y and priv acy-preserv ation challenges; (2) social net work mo deling, scalable, customizable social net work in-frastructure construction , dynamic gro wth and evolution patterns iden ti cation and disco very using mac hine learn-ing approac hes or multi-agen t based sim ulation. There were 23 pap ers submitted to WebKDD/SNAKDD 2007. Eac h of the pap ers was strictly review ed by at least three review ers from the WebKDD 2007 program commit-tee. Due to the qualit y and div ersit y of the submissions, we accepted 8 pap ers as regular pap ers and 5 as short pap ers. The workshop pap ers, whic h are available at http://w orkshops.so cialnet work analysis.info/w ebsnakdd2007 , have been divided into three categories dep ending on their topics: (1) Comm unit y Structure Disco very; (2) Web and Online Comm unit y Mining, (3)So cial Dynamics and Mo d-els. In addition to accepted pap ers, we also invited Dr. Ragh u Ramakrishnan from Yaho o to give a talk on The workshop attracted interest from a large num ber of con-ference participan ts. Among them include participan ts from academia and governmen t agencies, Web related industry , as well as practitioners from other companies. The workshop included an invited talk session and three pap er presen ta-tions, as describ ed below. The pap er, \No de Roles and Comm unit y Structure in Net-works" by Jerry Scripps, Pang-Ning Tan and Ab dol-Hossein Esfahanian, de nes comm unit y-based roles that the nodes can assume (am bassadors, big sh, loners, and bridges) and sho ws how existing link mining techniques can be impro ved by kno wledge of suc h roles [11]. A new comm unit y-based metric is introduced for estimating the num ber of comm uni-ties link ed to a node. Using this metric and a mo di cation of degree, the authors sho w how to assign comm unit y-based roles to the nodes. The pap er also illustrates the bene ts of kno wing the comm unit y-based node roles in the con text of link-based classi cation and in uence maximization. The pap er, \Comm unit y Detection in Large-Scale Social Net works" by Nan Du, Bin Wu, Xin Pei , Bai Wang and Li-utong Xu, presen ts an algorithm ComT ector ( Com munit y De tector ) whic h is more ecien t for the comm unit y de-tection in large-scale social net works based on the nature of overlapping comm unities in the real world [4]. This algo-rithm does not require any priori kno wledge about the num-ber or the original division of the comm unities. Exp erimen-tal results sho w that this algorithm can extract meaningful comm unities that are agreed with both of the objectiv e facts and intuitions.
 The pap er, \Sp ectral Clustering in Telephone Call Graphs" by Miklos Kurucz, Andras A. Benczur, Karoly Csalog any and Laszl o Luk acs evaluates various heuristics for hierar-chical spectral clustering in large telephone call graphs and prop oses a solution that enables k-w ay cuts in eac h step by immediately ltering unbalanced or low qualit y clusters before splitting them further [6]. Exp erimen tal results indi-cated that this prop osed approac h can give geographically much more homogeneous clusters with the size distribution of our clusters resem bling to that of the settlemen t structure. The pap er, \Wh y We Twitter: Understanding Microblog-ging Usage and Comm unities" by Aksha y Java, Xiao dan Song, Tim Finin and Belle Tseng presen ts the observ ations of the microblogging phenomena by studying the top ological and geographical prop erties of Twitter's social net work [5]. In this pap er, the authors nd that people use microblog-ging to talk about their daily activities and to seek or share information. Finally , the authors analyze the user inten tions asso ciated at a comm unit y level and sho w how users with similar inten tions connect with eac h other.
 The pap er, \Lo oking for Great Ideas: Analyzing the In-novation Jam", by Claudia Perlic h, Mary Helander, Ric k Lawrence, Yan Liu, Saharon Rosset and Chandan Reddy discusses the Inno vation Jam that IBM carried out in 2006, with the objectiv e of iden tifying inno vativ e and promising \Big Ideas" through a mo derated on-line discussion between IBM worldwide emplo yees and external con tributors [9]. The authors describ e the data available and investigate sev eral analytical approac hes to address the challenge of under-standing \ho w inno vation happ ens" and to facilitate the success of future Jams. They also demonstrate the social net work structure of data and its time dep endence, and dis-cuss the results of both sup ervised and unsup ervised learn-ing applied to this data.
 The pap er, \Automated Social Hierarc hy Detection through Email Net work Analysis" by Ryan Rowe, German Creamer, Shlomo Hershk op and Sal Stolfo pro vides a novel algorithm for automatically extracting social hierarc hy data from elec-tronic comm unication beha vior [10]. The algorithm is based on data mining user beha viors to automatically analyze and catalog patterns of comm unications between entities in a email collection to extract social standing. The adv antage to suc h automatic metho ds is that they extract relev ancy between hierarc hy levels and are dynamic over time. The authors illustrate the algorithms over real world data using the Enron corp oration email archiv e. The results sho w great promise when compared to the corp orations work chart and judicial pro ceeding analyzing the ma jor players. The pap er, \Applying Link-based Classi cation to Lab el Blogs" by Smriti Bhagat, Graham Cormo de and Irina Rozen-baum studys the problem of inferring the classi cation of all the objects from a lab eled subset, using only the link-based information amongst the objects [2]. The authors presen t two classes of algorithms, based on local and global simi-larities. This pap er focuses on multigraphs induced by blog data, and carefully apply their general algorithms to specif-ically infer lab els suc h as age, gender and location asso ci-ated with the blog based only on the link-structure amongst them. They perform a comprehensiv e set of exp erimen ts with real, large-scale blog data sets and sho w that signi can t accuracy is possible from little or no non-link information, and their metho ds scale to millions of nodes and edges. The pap er, \A Recommender System Based on Local Ran-dom Walks and Spectral Metho ds" by Zeinab Abbassi and Vahab Mirrokni designs recommender systems for weblogs based on the link structure among them [1]. The authors prop ose algorithms based on re ned random walks and spec-tral metho ds. First, they observ e the use of the personalized page rank vector to capture the relev ance among nodes in a social net work. The authors apply the local partitioning algorithms based on re ned random walks to appro ximate the personalized page rank vector, and extend these ideas from undirected graphs to directed graphs. Moreo ver, in-spired by ideas from spectral clustering, the authors design a similarit y metric among nodes of a social net work using the eigen values and eigen vectors of a normalized adjacency matrix of the social net work graph. The exp erimen tal re-sults justify the use of a link-based recommender system for social net works with large average degree. The pap er, \Exploiting Time-V arying Relationships in Sta-tistical Relational Mo dels" by Umang Sharan and Jennifer Neville presen ts an initial approac h to mo deling dynamic re-lational data graphs in predictiv e mo dels of attributes [12]. More speci cally , this pap er uses a two-step pro cess that rst summarizes the dynamic graph with a weigh ted static graph and then incorp orates the link weigh ts in a relational Bayes classi er. The authors evaluate this approac h on the Cora dataset (where co-author and citation links vary over time) sho wing that our approac h results in signi can t per-formance gains over a baseline approac h that ignores the temp oral comp onen t of the data.
 The pap er, \Learning to Rank Typed Graph Walks: Local and Global Approac hes" by Einat Mink ov and William Co-hen considers the setting of lazy graph walks over directed graphs, where entities are represen ted as nodes and typed edges represen t the relations between them [8]. This frame-work has been used in a variet y of problems to deriv e an extended measure of entity similarit y. In this pap er the authors con trast two di eren t approac hes for applying su-pervised learning in this framew ork to impro ve graph walk performance: a gradien t descen t algorithm that tunes the transition probabilities of the graph, and a re-ranking ap-proac h that uses features describing a set of traversed paths. An empirical evaluation on a set of tasks from the domain of personal information managemen t sho w that re-ranking performance is usually sup erior to the local gradien t descen t algorithm. However, the metho ds are complimen tary and yield the best results when com bined. The two metho ds are also complimen tary in terms of their qualitativ e prop erties and applicabilit y.
 The pap er, \Dynamics of Collab orativ e Documen t Rating Systems" by Kristina Lerman constructs a mathematical mo del to study how collab orativ e rating and promotion of news stories emerges from indep enden t decisions made by man y users [7]. The mo del tak es into accoun t user beha vior: eg, whether they read stories on the fron t page or through the Friends interface. Solutions of the mo del qualitativ ely repro duce the observ ed dynamics of votes receiv ed by actual stories on Digg.
 The pap er, \Inferring Agen t Dynamics from Social Com-munication Net work" by Hung-Ching (Justin) Chen, Ma-lik Magdon-Ismail, Mark Goldb erg and William A. Wal-lace, presen ts a mac hine learning approac h to disco vering the agen t dynamics or micro-la ws that driv es the evolution of the social groups in a comm unit y [3]. The authors set up the problem by introducing a parameterized probabilis-tic mo del for the agen t dynamics: the acts of an agen t are determined by micro-la ws with unkno wn parameters. Their approac h is to iden tify the appropriate micro-la ws whic h cor-resp onds to iden tifying the appropriate parameters in the mo del. To solv e the problem this pap er dev elops heuristic exp ectation-maximization style algorithms for determining the micro-la ws of a comm unit y based on either the observ ed social group evolution, or observ ed set of comm unications between actors. The authors presen t the results of exten-sive exp erimen ts on sim ulated data as well as some results on real comm unities, e.g., newsgroups.
 The pap er, \DBConnect: Mining Researc h Comm unit y on DBLP Data" by Osmar Zaiane, Jiyang Chen, and Randy Goebel introduces DBconnect, a protot ype that exploits the social net work coded within the DBLP database by dra w-ing on a new random walk approac h to rev eal interesting kno wledge about the researc h comm unit y and even recom-mend collab orations [13]. In his invited talk, Dr. Raph u Ramakrishnan presen ted \Comm unit y systems: Social Net working Applications and Platforms". He elab orated the \so cial searc h" concept and how it can be used to impro ve searc h engine performance. After reviewing a few related emerging topics suc h as question-answ ering comm unities, comm unit y information managemen t, he prop osed \PeopleW eb" concept and illustrated the impli-cations on future searc h engines. The WebKDD/SNAKDD 2007 workshop con tinued a tradi-tion of exp osing strong and ever more inno vativ e researc h in critical areas of Web mining and social net work analysis, in particular, comm unit y disco very, collab orativ e ltering and recommender systems in general [1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11]. Moreo ver, this year saw increasing interest in new topics, mostly invigorated by the popularit y of the Web 2.0 and large scale social net works. Suc h topics included graph min-ing [8], comm unit y based data mining [13], and Web blogs and online forum analysis [2, 5, 9]. In addition, the dis-cussions that follo wed eac h presen tation and before closing the WebKDD/SNA-KDD 2007 workshop help ed raise sev-eral questions and bring to ligh t sev eral interesting future directions and challenges in the area of Web mining and so-cial net work analysis. In particular, participan ts discussed the imp ortance of researc h in new problems and applications that are becoming more prev alen t in the Web 2.0 con text. We would like to thank the authors of all submitted pa-pers. Their creativ e e orts have supp orted the comp eti-tive technical program of WebKDD/SNAKDD 2007.
