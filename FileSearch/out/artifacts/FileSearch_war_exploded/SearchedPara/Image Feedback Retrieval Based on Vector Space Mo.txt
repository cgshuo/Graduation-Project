 popularity of digital image equipments, there is an increasing number of digital image in research field. 
Traditional keyword-based retrieval is difficult to realize key-word automatic found to be a sealy hard job. Meanwhile the increasing number of image files and the influence of a marker X  X  subjective consciousness also makes difficult assigning correct annotations to each image file. In order to solve this problem, researchers put forward the CBIR (Content Based Image Retrieval). However, the chosen image features with CBIR are the basic visual characters of color, texture, shape, etc., which are unable to discern the real object, i.e, unable to convey the high level of semantic meanings in the images. For example, the retrieval of a sunset image will be followed CBIR system based on basic visual features can not meet the practical requirement of the common users. 
To make up the deficiencies of CBIR, the user X  X  relevance feedback retrieval is suggested. As a mutual retrieval process between a person and a computer, the relevance feedback technique enables the user to evaluate the retrieval results and to point out whether the results are relevant (positive examples or feedback) or not (negative examples and feedback) to the index destination. Based on this evaluation, an adjustment, which can be repetitive, is made for further retrieval until a satisfying retrieval result appears. 
Two strategies are adopted in this relevance feedback retrieval: moving inquiry vector and modulating re-weighing [1].The famous Rocchio[2] formula successfully negative feedback. Through generating the image feature vectors similar to text vectors, MARS (Multimedia Analysis and Retrieval System) employs this formula for image feedback retrieval [3]. 
Rui[4] and other researchers provide a hierarchically modulating re-weighting method, which observes the individual weighting arrangement of a feedback vectors in various dimensions of feature space. The distributed feature vectors of a feedback vector on i-th dimension are measured by its standard deviation i r . If the i r is bigger, then the degree of relevance between the weighing and the retrieval, then it becomes increased. 
Ishikawa [10] and others who have employed ellipsoid distance to presume the vector, have ameliorated the efficiency of feedback retrieval when the inquiry samples are insufficient. Recent combination of SVM and relevance feedback technique further advances retrieval accuracy [11]. of feedback technique based on vector model transformation for the sake of higher image will be regarded as the relevant information and turned into a new inquiry vector model. In the vector database, the vect or model is taken as the basic point. The inquiry basic point, furthers the spatial distance between irrelevant feature vectors and the inquiry point, and then reaches a better retrieval accuracy. A prototype system of the image database index is implemented. Compared with the relevant traditional methods, this retrieval technique is proved through experiments to have obviously improved the analogical retrieval of image. 
This paper puts forth the background and purpose of our study at the very beginning. Then the method of image feedback retrieval based on vector model transformation is introduced in section 2. Section 3 focuses on the experiment results work. 2.1 Basic Ideas No matter what kind of features a content-based image retrieval technique may have or no matter what kind of distant testing strategy is used, semantic meanings of images can not actually be represented. In addition, the user X  X  different emphases result in changing responses towards the retrieval objects, and the result is completely inquiry demand and then improve the inquiry results based on the forecast of the user X  X  inquiry intentions. 
Nakajima [5] and others have put forward a difference amplification feedback and some similar positive images that are not chosen by the user. Modulation of this difference can create new retrieval vectors corresponding to the user X  X  inquiry intentions. This technique requires the feature vectors to be clustered as a part of the organization of the database. 
With the application of user feedback information the documents transfigure the feature space, drawing positive feature vectors to and widening negative feature realized[6]. 
Grounded on these two ideas, a retrieval system is designed in which the user only needs to choose their intended image samples. Then, based on those positive samples intention. Furthermore, we amend the equation for the document in the retrieval system and change the feature vector spaces of the images of relevant positive feedback. In this way the relevant images X  feature vectors move gradually to the inquiry vector. Conversely the vector spaces of irrelevant images are more and more distant from the inquiry basic point. Then a clustering of vector spaces based upon the inquiry vector is realized. 
Our retrieval system runs according to the following processes. 1 The user appoints an inquiry sample in the general CBIR system. 2) Relevant retrieval is conducted on the basis of the user X  X  appointed inquiry sample. image samples among the retrieval results. transform the feature vector space model. 5 Skip to step 2). 2.2 Reproducing the Inquiry Vector In CBIR, if a suitable inquiry sample is chosen, then an ideal effect can be achieved. Hence, the choice of samples is most important. What X  X  more, in each retrieval step, even if the user chooses the comparatively suitable sample, the index result may not be satisfactory. At the same time, many experiments illustrate that user chosen positive feedback images bear strong similarities in semantic meaning and usually belong to the same semantic category, though they can be different in content. results. 
By improving on the former equation for inquiry movement, we use the user X  X  feedback samples to generate a new inquiry vector which can represent in some data of positive feedbacks are considered. In this way, the user only needs to choose their intended inquiry sample (as a positive sample) rather than give the relevant and irrelevant information as well as the qualifying degree, etc. in the retrieval. formula. 
Where, M is the sum of the chosen sample images. 2.3 Transformation of Vector Model Though the inquiry vector generated by the above formula can make, to a certain scope of the feature vector will reduce spontaneously with comparatively low similarities of the user X  X  chosen feedback images. For example, the user chooses some flag images as the feedback samples among the suggestive ones. But these images similarities for retrieval. 
Therefore, we adjust the feature vectors in the database of relevant images inquiry vector q , feedback vector j f and relevant vector i d is illustrated in Fig. 1. feedback. } { 1 K K i d d d = presents feature vector in the database. Transformation from vector i d to inquiry vector can be described in the following formula. 
In formula (3), parameter  X  and c  X  are two standard factors. Parameter i u is the similarity guideline, and parameter n is a punishment coefficient. In the process improved through constant change of these parameters. This hypothesis is proved by our experiment a results. M j K 1 = in the formula is the number of user X  X  feedback inquiry vector ' q . 2.4 Similarity Measurement In CBIR, the Euclidean or weighted Euclidean distance is usually applied to similarity measurement of feature vectors. However, experiments prove that only through certain sum of positive feedback samples can Euclidean ameliorate retrieval result. 
Ishikawa[10] and others have achieved the relevance feedback retrieval through utilization of elliptical distance measure function. This distance measurement can handle some special situations. Therefore, in our feedback retrieval system the elliptical distance function is adopted for the similarity measurement of features vectors. (Illustration by the right picture of Fig. 2. ) distance measurement of bevel or even of arbitrary directions. 
The measurement of elliptical distance is described with the following formula: positive symmetry rank of n n  X  . 3.1 Construction of the Image Database Based on previous ideas, a prototype system of image retrieval is constructed. In our image database 51138 images of various kinds are collected and classified according among the same sort of images still exists in the terms of content. Two feature data of images are introduced: color and texture. 
As the distance between colors counted by RGB color space can not represent the actual difference between the two colors sensed by the user, an L*u*v color scheme is thus adopted to accord the definition of color distance with the user X  X  visual features. A description on how to transform RGB to L*u*v can be found at [7]. 
As for texture features, as introduced by Tamura [9] and used by QBIC [8], they basically correspond to the degree of finish and orientation of textures in an image. 
With these two types of features combined, 48 dimensions of color features and 48 dimensions of texture features, we have adopted a total of 96 dimension features for our retrieval implementation. 3.2 Experiment Results and Evaluation user X  X  selection order, a relatively ideal retrieval result is acquired when the digressive extent is 0.2. In the experiment of formula (2), the ideal index effect will be obtained 
Recall and Precision are adopted to judge the retrieval function: 
Where, retrieval donates collection of the returning retrieval objects from the system; relevant indicates collection of the actually relevant objects in the database. retrieval in the system, it can be observed that the retrieval accuracy is improved to a great extent especially that of the retrieval of flag (Fig. 3). 
A comparison is made between the traditional retrieval methods and the technique described in this paper. Each experiment sub-catalog is retrieved ten times and the feedback is gained correspondingly. The comparative study of the average maximal retrieval accuracy is illustrated in the vertical square plot in Fig. 5. 
And Fig. 6 is a comparative plot of retrieval precision based on the changes of parameters in formula (2).
Fig. 7 is an evaluation plot of the influence from the number of feedback samples over index function. In the system, the first 100 images are sorted into 5 pages. Each found in the experiments that for the feedback sample with a single feedback the relatively higher than that of the general CBIR system. When the number of feedback samples reaches 7, the system will achieve its ideal retrieval effect. 
Also tested was the influence of the number of times feedback. It was given that 3 or 4 times can result in an ideal retrieval effect, which is what the user expects to get. 
Built on Linux server, our prototype retrieval system was created in C and PHP whole (CPU: Intel Pentium III 800 OS: Vine Linux 2.6). 
The experiment results indicate that retrieval accuracy of this method is much higher than the traditional feedback index. This paper proposed a technique of transforming the characteristic vector space on the Contrasted with the traditional retrieval method, this one has the benefit of self-study prototype system designed in this way, shows that the suggested method can obviously improve the efficiency of relevant feedback retrieval. 
Henceforth, based on its prototype further expansion of this system X  X  function will be conducted, which will mainly include the following aspects: (1) To summarize the visual characteristic of images and to make inquiry more suitable to the user. (2) To implement better self-study and self-adoption; to reduce the noisy images among retrieval results, and to further improve the index precision.
