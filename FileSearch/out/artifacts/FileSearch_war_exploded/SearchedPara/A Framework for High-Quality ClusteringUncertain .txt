Analyzing and mining such kinds of data stream have be-coming a hot topic. Mining uncertain data stream is much more difficult than mining tasks over deterministic data stream.

Clustering is one of the most important tasks in data mining field. Most of tra-ditional clustering methods in an uncertain data set treat the distances between tuples as the unique factor to cluster. However, when the data is uncertain with error, not only consider the expected va lue, but also consider the uncertainty of the data. The presence of uncertainty can significantly affect the results of clustering. In the clustering process, the data with higher uncertainty may be treated differently fro m those which have lower uncertainty [1] [2].
In this paper, we adopt the sliding window model and Voronoi diagram to cluster uncertain data stream. Our main contributions are as follows: (1) We provide a method to quantify tuple uncertainty in order to distinguish the uncertainty of different estimated error.
 (2) The cluster algorithm is proposed with Voronoi diagram over sliding win-dow. (3) We also implement a series of experiment evaluation, showing that our method is effective and efficient.
 This paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we propose a metric to quantify uncertainty of tuple in Section 2. In section 3, we propose an algorithm for clustering uncertain data stream with Voronoi diagram over sliding windows, and elaborate the implementation details respectively. Section 4 we will discuss the experimental results. Finally, we give a brief conclusion and point out the future work in Section 5. In this section, the method which is introduced to quality of uncertainty is used for distinguishing the quality of uncertain data. We assume it is available that the estimated error of the data stream. Each point is composed of tuple value and estimated error of each dimension. In fact, it X  X  an uncertainty deduction procedure. We can see that the smaller t he range of tuple, the less uncertainty of it. If we can obtain certain data, its uncertainty will reduce to zero, then it transforms to a deterministic situation. Above analysis indicates that estimated error of a tuple is highly correlated with its uncertainty. We further define the tuple uncertainty as the function.
 Definition 1. (tuple uncertainty) tuple x i is two-dimensional data, the tuple un- X  ( x d i )(1  X  d  X  2) is the error value of the d-dimensional of x i . Property 1. (low bound) u ( x i ) &gt; 0, uncertainty of tuple x i is greater than zero. Property 2. (upper bound) u ( x i ) &lt; 1, uncertainty of tuples x i is always less than 1.
 Proof. suppose the inequality further implies that obviously, this inequality does not hold, the assumption is not true. So the un-certainty of tuple u ( x i )isalwayslessthan1.
 Property 3. Tuple uncertainty is only a function of estimated error. It does not depend on the actual values of tuple, but only on its estimated error for each dimension.
 By Definition 1, the uncertainty of tuple is available. Through uncertainty of tuple, uncertainty of cluster can be obtained.
 u x i represent the uncertainty of the x i , the uncertainty of cluster is define as Based on the quantification of uncertainty, we propose the algorithm to cluster uncertain data stream with Voronoi diagram over sliding windows. Although in [1], Aggarwal and Yu proposed Error based Cluster Feature (ECF) to handle uncertain data stream. However, the influence of uncertainty has not been con-sidered in the procedure of uncertain stream clustering, which affects the quality of cluster results. In this paper, we emphasize the influence that uncertainty to cluster results. 3.1 Problem Definition We assume that uncertain data stream consists of a set of two-dimensional un-T Estimated error of tuple for each dimension is  X  ( x d i )(1  X  d  X  2) respectively. 3.2 Framework The micro-clustering model was first proposed in [3] for large data sets, in order to cope with the uncertain stream model, a variety of micro-clusters are defined, named Micro-Cluster Feature (MCF)(Definition 3).
 Definition 3. (MCF): A Micro-Cluster feature(MCF) for a set of d-dimensional (1  X  d  X  2)) points with time stamps T 1 , T 2 ,  X  X  X  , T i ,  X  X  X  , T n , for any i&lt;n , T entries. The definition of each of these entries is as follows:  X  For each dimension, the sum of squares of the data values is maintained in CF 2 x ( C ) .Thevalueofj-thentryis n i =1 ( x i ) 2 .
  X  For each dimension, the sum of the data is maintained in CF 1 x ( C ) .The j-th entry of CF 1 x ( C ) is equal to n i =1 x i .  X  The number of points in the cluster is maintained in n(C).  X  The uncertainty of cluster is maintained in U(C).  X  The time point of the most recent point is maintained in t(C).
 We note that error based micro-clusters maintain the important additive property which is critical to its use in the clustering process.
 Property 4. (MCF additive): Let C 1 , C 2 denote two sets of points. MCF ( C 1  X  C ) is available, according to MCF ( C 1 )and MCF ( C 2 ).
 The values of entries CF 2 x ( C ), CF 1 x ( C ), and n ( C ) are the sum of the corre-sponding entries in MCF ( C 1 )and MCF ( C 2 ).Thesingletemporalcomponent one, when new data point arrived, MCF o f the new cluster can be calculated easily and rapidly.

In the practical application, people of ten more care about the most recent dis-tribution of the data stream, sliding window model can be used to better present the characteristics of current data stream. The algorithm we proposed is based on sliding window, can phase out outdated data in a timely manner, present the characteristics of current data stream really. In this section, we adopt the model to update uncertain data stream over sliding window was proposed in [4]. 3.3 Clustering Algorithm For the m points arrived early, we establish micro-cluster for each point, and build voronoi diagram. In Figure 1, when the next uncertain data x i arrives, cal-culate the uncertainty of tuples, by Definition 1. At the same time, we determine whether the range of data point is within a cluster in the voronoi diagram. If it is true, calculate the distance d is from expected value of x i to centroid of the cluster, when d is &lt; X  (  X  is the threshold) add uncertain data x i to the cluster, update the MCF. Otherwise, we merge the two clusters, create a new cluster for the current data. If the range of data x i is on the junction of n clusters, we calculate the distance fr om expected value of data x i to centroid of the n clusters respectively, and select some of them ( d is &lt; X  ), assuming the data are added to each cluster, calculate U ( C ) of each cluster, pick up the cluster with maximum value of to absorb the data point x i . 3.4 Update Voronoi Diagram While a new data point is added to a cluster, the centroid of cluster may be changed, in Figure 2, point c 1 is centroid of the cluster, however, c 1 is the new centroid of the cluster after it was merged a new point, we update the Voronoi diagram, only need to recalculat e perpendicular bisector from c 1 to centroid of adjacent cluster, and no need to change other parts of Voronoi diagram. This reduces the number of unnecessary calculations, to improve updated speed. In this section, we employed UMicro [5 ] as the competitive method. To evalu-ate the clustering quality, efficiency of the H-QCUDS and UMicro algorithm, both real and synthetic data sets are used in our experiments. Specifically, we show the algorithm that we proposed can get high quality clustering result. The method can achieve superior performan ces and it is scalable to fit for the stream requirement. 4.1 Clustering Quality We use uncertainty mean (UM) to measure the level of uncertainty in clustering result.As[2],the UM is defined as the average uncertainty of overall online micro clusters. In general, the smaller UM value is, the greater quality of the clustering result.

Figures 3 shows the clustering quality comparison results. It is clear that, in each case, the H-QCUDS provided superior quality to UMicro under UM crite-rion. The high clustering quality of H-QCUDS benefit from that our algorithm pay more attention to the uncertainty of the data tuples. 4.2 Efficiency Test In Figures 4, we illustrate the efficiency of the clustering method on the different data sets. We can see that both the execution time of H-QCUDS and UMi-cro grow linearly as the stream proceed s, and H-QCUDS is more efficient than UMicro. It is clear that the H-QCUDS method is able to process thousands of points per second in each case. From thi s perspective, our H-QCUDS method is not only effective, but also a very efficient clustering method for uncertain data stream. In this paper, we proposed H-QCUDS, an algorithm used to cluster uncertain data stream with Voronoi diagram over the sliding window. A Micro-Clustering Feature (MCF) is presented to tracking the uncertain data streams. In order to improve clustering quality, H-QCUDS algorithm adopts a two phase stream clustering selection process. The experim ental results show that the clustering quality of the H-QCUDS algorithm is higher than that of UMicro algorithm. Next steps of our work are taking more complex uncertain data stream into account, such as high-dimensional.
