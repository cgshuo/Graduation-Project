 1. Introduction
In this paper, we present a formulation and case studies for patenting content-based retrieval processes retrieval systemgeneratesindexes toimagesbyvisualfeatureextraction andalsoclassifiesthosegenerated indexes to perform a certain retrieval function. Data-processing means, i.e., processes, here for content-basedretrieval,constitutecomputer-relatedinventionsintheformofcomputerprograms.Thoseinventions often combine prior disclosed means, and also comprise means for parameter setting as is adjusted to retrieve specific kinds of images in certain narrow domains. Inventors and practitioners demand a for-mulation of the conditions for patenting those data-processing processes. We formulate the conditions on patentability of processes for performing content-based retrieval in combining the prior disclosed means and/orcomprisingthemeansforparametersettingfromthepracticalstandpointsoftechnicaladvancement (nonobviousness) and specification (enablement). Our formulation follows the standards of patent exam-ination and litigation on computer-related inventions in the US. We confirm the feasibility and account-ability of our formulation by applying it to several inventions patented in the US. 1.1. Motivation: parameter setting components for content-based retrieval
Memory storage capacity has expanded tremendously to enable large-scale storage of image data in digital libraries. The digital library community demands an automatic and scalable solution for retrieval, especially in image libraries. After elaboration on keyword-based (or text-based) image retrieval, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is introduced to the digital library community. CBIR is appreciated for its automatic indexing to digital contents stored in multimedia digital libraries. CBIR also promotes a new technology, i.e.,  X  X  X omain-specific approach X  X , which is a type of content-based retrieval focused and optimizedtospecifictargetdomains,e.g.,afieldofbrainimages.Inthedomain-specificapproach,asearch engine classifies images stored in a digital library by its thresholding function that evaluates structural similarity of visual features of those stored images.

A component for  X  X  X arameter setting X  X  takes the form of a computer program and realizes the thres-holding function witha setofrangesofparametricvalues.In CBIR, thoseparametric values determineas thresholdswhichcandidateimageissimilartoanexemplaryrequestedimagebycomputationofsimilarity semantic similarity in certain specific domains.

Theparameter setting component isfamiliarinmechanicalinventions.Its typicalexampleisapatented thermostat invention for crude petroleum purification, which automatically monitors and fixes crude oil temperatureatacertainrangeunderitsexplosivepoint.Anotherexemplarypatentisathermostaticdevice in an automatic temperature controller in air cargo, which adjusts the body temperature of raw fish inside thecargointheproperrangesotheydonotgetfrozenbutkeepchilledduringthecourseoftransportation.
The parameter setting components in computer-related inventions define the scope of patent enforcement on computer programs with clear boundary. 1.2. Background: content-based image retrieval as patentable computer-related invention Akeyword-based retrievalsystemprovides imagesstoredinadigital librarywithpre-fixedindexterms.
Its search engine performs keyword-based retrieval by pattern matching of those index terms pre-fixed to candidate images with a certain requested keyword. A keyword-based (or text-based) retrieval system is often implemented in current Web search engines, e.g., Google (Brin &amp; Page, 1998, Brin, 1998).
Acontent-basedretrievalsystemextractsvisualfeaturesoutofimagesandgeneratesindexesoutofthose extracted features, classifies those generated indexes based on similarity computation and finds certain images, which are similar to a certain requested image, from candidate images stored in a digital library.

Images are then indexed by grouping those extracted features. The example indexes in the figure take the formofdecimaldata.Its finalprocessingstepdynamicallyclassifies thoseautomaticallygeneratedindexes by computing correlation of the values of those indexes every time users request a search. The retrieved images as data-processing results are ranked based on the structural similarity of their classified indexes.
The structural similarity represents semantic similarity of those retrieval results in the certain selected domain.
CBIRhastwotypesofretrievalapproachinitsapplieddomains:thedomain-generalapproachandthe domain-specific approach (Smeulders, Worring, Santini, Gupta, &amp; Jain, 2000, Rui, Huang, &amp; Chang, 1999). The domain-general approach is applied to broad domains that include various kinds of visual features extracted out of images. Its typical implementation includes Virage Image Retrieval (Bach et al., 1996):USPat.#5,893,095inventedbyJainetal.(1999),QBIC(Flickner,Sawhney,&amp;Niblack,1995):US Pat.#5,647,058invented by Agrawal,Equitz, Faloutsos,Flickner, andSwami (1997),WebSeek (Smith &amp;
Chang, 1997), and also, VisualSEEK (Smith &amp; Chang, 1996). The domain-specific approach is applied to narrowdomainsinwhichseveralspecificvisualfeaturesextractedoutofimagesrepresentthesemanticsof the target domains. Its typical implementation includes medical image retrieval systems, e.g., US Pat. # 6,125,194 invented by Yeh, Lure, and Lin (2000) and fingerprint image retrieval systems, e.g., US Pat. # 6,356,649 invented by Harkless, Potter, Monro, and Thebaud (2002).

Broad domains describe  X  X  X heir semantics only partially X  X , though specific domains restrict their  X  X  X ari-ability X  X  on the extracted features in the  X  X  X imited and predictable X  X  scope (Smeulders et al., 2000). Fig. 2 outlinesthedata-processingofthedomain-specificapproachusingahypotheticalexampleofstarfishimage retrieval. Its pre-processing step is almost the same as the data-processing outlined in Fig. 1, but for the processing of restricted selection of features and classification comprising the means for  X  X  X arameter set-ting X  X , i.e., the means for selecting and/or adjusting parametric values on operating parameters. Its classi-fication step determines whether the classified indexes fall within certain pre-defined ranges of parametric valuesontheparametersetting(e.g.,forsimilaritycomputationoftheindexes).Thehypotheticalrangesof values take  X 125 in the double-lined box of Fig. 2 as approximated ranges of parametric values for thresholding of each generated index in the form of decimal data. 1.3. Issues: requirements for patentability of content-based retrieval processes
CBIR realizes its retrieval function by performing a number of  X  X  X rocesses X  X , i.e., methods or means embodied in computer-related inventions that take the form of computer programs. Those processes for CBIR consist of combinations of data-processing means, some of which are prior disclosed inventions.
Also,thoseprocessescomprisethemeansforparametersettingthatisadjustedtoretrievespecifickindsof images in certain narrow domains as in the domain-specific approach. The domain-specific approach implements its best mode by selecting parametric values, such as weights, on parameter setting that index and classify the extracted features in certain specific narrow domains.

Inventors and practitioners demand a detailed formulation of the conditions for patenting those data-processing processes, here, content-based retrieval processes in digital libraries, as computer-related inventions in the form of computer programs as combinations of processes with parameter setting com-ponents.

Thescopeofthispaperis,nonetheless,limitedtoseveralrequirementsforpatentability:nonobviousness (technical advancement) on a combination of prior disclosed computer programs and enablement (speci-fication) on parameter setting components in the domain-specific approach of CBIR.
 Therestofthispaperisorganizedasfollows.InSection2,weformulatetheconditionsonpatentability.
In Section 3, we provide case studies to confirm the feasibility of the formulated conditions. In Sections 4 and 5, we conclude with discussions on our formulation. 2. Conditions on patentability
In Section 2, we formulate the conditions on patentability of processes for content-based retrieval in digital libraries, i.e., the processes for performing CBIR functions as computer-related inventions in the form of computer programs in combining prior disclosed means, and also in comprising the means for parameter setting.
 Those formulated conditions are described in the block diagram of Fig. 3 with the list of conditions in
Table1.Thedouble-lined-boxesintheblockdiagramrepresentthemostcriticalconditionsconcerningthe combination of means and the parameter setting components. Our formulation follows the standards of patent examination and litigation in the US practice. We provide the formulation with a simulation example, i.e.,  X  X  X irage Image Retrieval X  X . 2.1. Procedural diagrams of the formulated conditions
The formulated conditions consist of the following three requirements for patentability:  X  X  X atentable subject matter X  X  (entrance to patent protection),  X  X  X onobviousness X  X  (technical advancement) and  X  X  X nable-ment X  X (specification).Patentablesubjectmatteris X  X  X heissueofwhichtypesofinventionswillbeconsidered for patent protection X  X . Nonobviousness is  X  X  X he technical advancement reflected in an invention X  X . In general, nonobviousness is the ultimate condition on patentability, though enablement has received increasing attention as  X  X  X he technical specification requirement X  X  since the late eighties of the previous century in the US practice (Merges, 1997). 2.1.1. Requirement for patentable subject matter in the form of computer programs
The processes for performing CBIR functions are patentable subject matter when their patent appli-cations claim the means for parameter setting which perform certain retrieval functions.
Otherwise, the discussed processes are considered not as specific inventions of the data-processing processesforperformingCBIRfunctionsbutastheinventionsthatareperipheralorjustrelatedtogeneral retrieval functions.

In the US practice, a data-processing process or method is patentable subject matter in the form of a computer-related invention, i.e., a computer program (US Patent Act, 2003, Jakes &amp; Yoches, 1989) as a  X  X  X eans-plus-function X  X  (In re Trovato, 1995) as long as the  X  X  X pecific machine ... produce(s) a useful,
Alappat, 1994). A process must  X  X  X erform independent physical acts (post-computer process activities) X  X , otherwise,  X  X  X anipulate data representing physical objects or activities to achieve a practical application (pre-computer process activities) X  X . A process must not  X  X  X erely manipulate abstract idea or solve a purely mathematical problem without any limitation to a practical application X  X  (US Patent &amp; Trademark Office, 1996a, 1996b).

The processes for performing CBIR functions are patentable subject matter because they comprise the meansforparametersettingandthosemeansperformphysicaltransformationofdata,i.e.,imageretrieval processing. CBIR functions generate indexes as physical results on a computer and a memory, and also require pre-and post-computer process activities through data processing between feature extraction and indexing,alsobetweenindexingandclassification,asindispensableprocedure.Inthecaseofnoclaimingof themeansforparametersetting,thoseprocessesdonotrealizeanyspecificadvancementoncontent-based general retrieval functions.

Finally,theUSpracticedemandsthatinventionsbeof X  X  X echnologicalarts X  X .Thatrequirementdoesnot limit patentability of computer-related inventions because technological arts are fully equivalent to, in a broad sense, the concept of useful or practical arts (Merges, 1997). 2.1.2. Requirement for nonobviousness on data-processing means of combination
The processes for performing CBIR functions are nonobvious from the prior arts when they (1) comprise combinations of prior disclosed means to perform certain functions that are not predicated (2) realize quantitative and/or qualitative advancement.

Otherwise, the discussed processes are obvious so that they are not patentable as the processes for per-forming CBIR functions.

First,acombinationofpriordisclosedmeansshouldnotbe X  X  X uggested X  X  X romthedisclosedmeans X  X  X ith the reasonable expectation of success X  X  in the US practice (In re Dow Chemical Co., 1988). Second, its asserted function must be superior to conventional functions that are realized in the prior disclosed or patented means. On the latter issue, several solutions for performance evaluation are applicable. Studies (M  X  uller,M  X  uller,Squire,Marchand-Maillet,&amp;Pun,2001,ManchesterVisualizationCenter,2003)propose benchmarking of CBIR functions. The patent application for US Pat. # 6,259,809 invented by Maruo (2001) reports a suggestive solution for performance evaluation by comparing the computational order of its instant inventive process with one of a conventional disclosed process. Another general strategy is restriction of the scope of claims to a certain narrow field to which no prior arts have been applied. This claiming strategy is a kind of local optimization of application scope. 2.1.3. Requirement for enablement on parameter setting components
TheprocessesforperformingCBIRfunctionsmustbedescribedclearlyenoughtoenablethoseskilledin the arts to implement the best mode of those claimed processes by satisfying the following conditions: (1-a) The descriptions of the processes must specify the formulas for parameter setting. Otherwise, (1-b) the disclosed inventions should have its co-pending application that describes the formulas in detail. In addition, (2-a) the processes must perform a new function by a combination of the prior disclosed means.
Otherwise, (2-b) theprocessesshouldhavetheimprovedformulasforparametersettingbasedonthepriordisclosed meansforperformingCBIRfunctionsandalsogiveexamplesofthevaluesontheparametersettinginthe descriptions. 1-a and 1-b determinewhetherthediscussedprocessesarepatentablecombinationsofthepriordisclosed means for performing CBIR functions. 2-a determines whether the discussed processes are patentable as a domain-general approach. 2-b determines whether the discussed processes are patentable as a domain-specific approach when the processes specify the improved formulas for parameter setting based on the previous disclosed means.

For 2-b , the processes must specify the means for parameter setting by  X  X  X iving a specific example of preparing an X  X  application (Autogiro Co. of America v. United States, 1967, Unique Concepts, Inc. v.
Brown, 1991) to enable those skilled in the arts to implement their best mode of those processes without undue experiment. The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) suggests in its Guidelines and Training
Materials that a process comprising the means for parameter setting should comply with the requirement forenablementbygivingexamplesofspecificvaluesonparametersetting(USPatent&amp;TrademarkOffice, 1996a, 1996b).

The processes comprising the means for parameter setting must disclose at least one of the following examples of values on parameter setting: (i) Working or prophetic examples of initial values or weights on the parameter setting; (ii) Working examples of the ranges of values on the parameter setting.

The  X  X  X orking examples X  X  are parametric values that are confirmed to work in the laboratory or as prototype testing results (In re Strahilevitz, 1982). The USPTO has also accepted in practice so-called  X  X  X ropheticexamples X  X ,especiallyintheareaofbiotechnologyafterthedecisiononInreStrahilevitz(1982).
Those prophetic examples are given without actual work by one skilled in the art. Fig. 4 describes the hypothetical example that provides the example range of parametric values, here weights on parameter values.

The parameter setting components defines the scope of patent enforcement of computer programs as processpatents.Itisacriticalproblemtodefinethescopeofequivalentmodificationofprocesspatents.Its typical case is found in the computer programs comprising parameter setting components. The scope of patentenforcementextendstotheequivalentsofthestructureofmeans-plus-functionclaimsasfarasthey arepredictablefromthoseclaimsanddescriptions(PennwaltCorp.v.Durand-Wayland,Inc.,1988,Graver

A simulation example for the formulated procedural diagram  X  X  X irageImageRetrieval X  X (VIR)wasdevelopedintheearly1990sasatypicalcontent-basedretrievalof visual objectsstoredindigitalimage libraries.

Its claims consist of  X  X  X unction containers X  X  as means-plus-functions for feature extraction and similarity computation. Its first claim, as described below, constitutes the primitives as the means-plus-functions.
Those primitives realize a domain-general approach of CBIR by the formulas on parameter setting with  X  X  X eighted sums X  X .

Fig. 5 outlines the application of our formulation to the VIR invention. First, on its patentable subject matter, its retrieval processes consisting of the formula for parameter setting are to be determined as patentable subject matter in the form of computer programs. Those data-processing processes generate physical transformation on a specific machine, i.e., a computer memory with certain classification results.
Second, on its nonobviousness, those data-processing processes are inventive steps that consist of combi-nationsofthepriorartsonthresholdingfunctionsasimplementedintheintegrationofclassificationbased on similarity computation, visual feature extraction and automatic indexing techniques. Those combina-tions are not predicated from any conventional keyword-based retrieval technique.

In the rest of Section 3, we confirm the feasibility and accountability of the formulated conditions on patentability of data-processing processes for performing CBIR functions in digital libraries by applying the formulated conditions to several instances of patents disclosed in the US.

Those search terms are wide enough not to miss inventions performingCBIRfunctionsbutdescribedintermsofpatternrecognition.Table2listseightpatentsthatwe selected from the above 385 patents for case study by screening out the other peripheral data-processing processes that do not perform CBIR functions. The first case in the list is a typical one of the latter peripheral inventions for general retrieval functions. Among the remaining seven cases, five cases take the domain-general approach while the remaining two cases take the domain-specific approach. 3.1. Patentable subject matter cases
Seven patents claim the means for parameter setting in their processes as patentable subject matter of technological arts. The remaining single case is an exception that is not patentable as a process for per-forming content-based retrieval functions. It is an invention that is just peripheral or related to general retrieval functions. US Pat. # 6,253,201 invented by Abdel-Mottaleb and Wu (2001) realizes a data-pro-cessingprocessforlistingthepre-indexedimageidentifiers,whicharebasedonthepriorartsofcolorand/ or edge detection for performing fast classification, as described in its first claim.

Nonobviousness cases
The processes for performing CBIR functions must realize quantitative and/or qualitative technical advancement with a combination of prior disclosed means. 3.2.1. Quantitative advancement
A typical case of quantitative nonobviousness is the US Pat. # 6,259,809 invented by Maruo (2001), as described in Table 3. Its process realizes, as an inventive step, a new function of edge detection of the rotated, magnified or minified images of linear components, e.g., semiconductor wafers, without pre-determined angles for rotation, etc. by combining the prior arts on the Hough transformation and thres-holding on similarity computation. Its description asserts its superior performance by comparing the computational order of their instant inventive method with ones of conventional disclosed methods, as described in its detailed description of the preferred embodiments.

Qualitative advancement
A typical case of qualitative nonobviousness is the US Pat. # 6,240,423 invented by Hirata (2001), as described in Table 4. Its process realizes an inventive step that provides drawbacks of conventional means for CBIR with a solution that isa newfunction of object-based CBIR. That inventive step consists of a twofold processing of region detection and boundary detection, which is based on another process patented by the same inventor. Its description asserts its superior property by comparing it with leading systems, here, Virage and QBIC, as described in its below detailed description of the preferred embodi-ments.

A certain domain-specific approach not only performs a new function by a combination of prior dis-closed means but also has certain improved formulas for parameter setting based on the prior disclosed means in order to perform CBIR functions. In this case, the descriptions of the process for the domain-specific approach must give its parameter setting with examples of parametric values that are the working or prophetic examples of initial values or weights, otherwise, the working examples of the ranges of parametricvalues.ItstypicalcaseisUSPat.#6,356,649inventedbyHarklessetal.(2002),asdescribedin Table 6.

CBIR is promising for retrieving images in a large-scale digital library. In particular on application, its domain-specific approach has received attention and elaboration in several areas including the following fields: medical image retrieval systems of radiological or MRI images of nodules in brains, abdomens, intestines, etc.; product deficit image retrieval systems in artificial manu-factures including semiconductor wafers; and authentication systems based on human skin and pupil patterns, etc.

Our formulation focuses on parameter setting components that determine, with their thresholding functions, whether a candidate image is similar to an exemplary requested image in certain specific do-mains.Inventorsaspatentapplicantsshouldprovide parametersetting withexamplerangesofparametric values, otherwise exemplary initial values or weights.

Our formulation is limited to several requirements for patentability: patentable subject matter, non-obviousnessandenablement.Noveltyandotherproceduralissuesshouldbeconsultedwithgeneralpatent law research. 5. Conclusions
In this paper, we have formulated the conditions on patentability of data-processing processes for performing content-based retrieval functions as combinations of prior disclosed means and also on pro-cesses comprising the means for parameter setting. There exist two critical issues in satisfaction of requirements for patentability on those processes. One is nonobviousness on a combination of the prior disclosed means. Theotherisenablementonparametersetting thatrealizes adomain-specific approachof content-based retrieval. Our formulation follows the standards of patent examination and litigation on computer-related inventions that are practiced in the US. The case study shows the feasibility and accountability of our formulated conditions on patentability that facilitate patenting those functional processes of CBIR in the US.

We are preparing a paper that formulates systematic digital library protection by using patentable content-based retrieval processes (Sasaki &amp; Kiyoki, 2003, 2004).
