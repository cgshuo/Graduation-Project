 Bilingual lexicons are essential for translation practice, and fundamental for example-based machine translation (Piao, 2002). They are also valuable resources for comparative language studies. However, the instances of unlexicalised concepts in a target language present particular difficulties to the building of bilingual lexicons. One of the most appealing instances involving the Chinese language concerns the concept  X  X den-tity X . This concept is deep ly trenched in western tradition and closely associated with other key notions such as  X  X erson X ,  X  X ndividuality X ,  X  X uman rights X . However, personal identity does not op-erate similarly in Eastern cultures. In a Chinese social context, a person X  X  identity very often de-pends on his/her social network  X  e.g., who his/her family members are, who he/she knows well, which social group he/she belongs to. The concept of personal identity is not readily lexi-calised in Chinese (cf. 2.2). There is therefore no clear counterpart of identity in the Chinese lan-guage. However, the present study makes use of parallel corpora to gather the instances of transla-tion of  X  X dentity X  into Chinese, in an attempt to make suggestions for potential candidates that render the concept into Chinese. In this section, we will survey the definitions of identity in dictionaries and in the research on WordNet, and review previous research on the problem to translate  X  X dentity X  into Chinese. 2.1 Entry in dictionaries and WordNet Different dictionaries define  X  X dentity X  in differ-ent scopes and varied fine-grainedness. We sur-veyed several commonly-used dictionaries  X  Collins Cobuild Advanced Dictionary of English (seventh Edition) , Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners , Oxford English Diction-ary , English-Chinese Dictionary  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (by Lu Gusun), and New Time English-English English-Chinese Dictionary (by Yan Yuanshu). Each dictionary denotes two to five senses of the entry  X  X dentity X  (we excluded obsolete, technical, regional usage). The typical senses include (a) the distinctive characteristics of a person or a place, (b) who a person is, and (c) sameness be-tween two entities. The online dictionary.com provides a visual thesaurus that displays four major senses of  X  X dentity X  in the form of four branches  X  personal identity, identicalness, iden-tification, and (mathematical) identity operator (http://www.visualthesaurus. com). Such a visual representation closely resembles the four senses used in WordNet. We examine all the senses of  X  X dentity X  in our research, except the mathematic one, e.g., identity operator. 2.2 Difficulty to perceive the concept Previous research has documented that Chinese learners of English tend to find the western con-cept of personal identity unfamiliar to their own practice and feel it is difficult to perceive lan-guage use associated with this concept (Richter and Song, 2005). The problem may stem from the Confucius tradition  X  it attaches importance to collectivism, universal virtues, common good of a community, but disfavours personal endeav-ours for self realisation (Yum, 1988). In the so-cial context of China today, individuals X  power and identity heavily derive from their social net-work, family ties, and social in-groupness. Rich-ter and Song X  X  (2005) study demonstrates that Chinese speakers encounter much difficult to translate the key concepts such as identity, self, myself into Chinese. Their informants provided a range of solutions, which are understandably of-ten disagreeable and dissatisfactory. We examine the major senses of  X  X dentity X , ex-cluding the mathematic use of the word. We col-translations into Chinese from parallel corpora. 3.1 Parallel corpora There are four resources used for data in the pre-sent study: 
We used all the search results (27 in total) of the first three resources and 73 results from the fourth one to build a sample of 100 pairs of Eng-lish-Chinese sentences for this research. The in-stances of reduplications and conspicuous typos and mistranslations were laid out. 3.2 Data analysis method A close examination of the 100 instances of  X  X dentity X  in our sample enabled its major senses to emerge and be classified in main groups. We will then investigate the possible equivalents in Chinese for each of the senses. 3.3 Results There are four major senses that emerged in our sample: (A) self-identity, (B1) public identity, (B2) an entity X  X  distinctive characteristics, and (C) sameness between two things. We can now examine each of the senses and the most fre-quently used items in Chinese to render the sense. 
A. Self-identity . This sense points to a per-son X  X  defining characteristic. It relates to his/her individuality, personality, and manhood. It does not have to be his/her public image, or titles and labels given by his/her social affiliations and networks. It is something deep inside, at the heart of his/her being. People tend to be aware of their own identity and consider it extremely im-portant and dear to them. Our sample contains nine instances of identity using Sense A. The translations into Chinese do not display any read-ily equivalent item. This echoes the finding of previous research that it is difficulty to express this sense of  X  X dentity X  in Chinese. The transla-tions in our sample tend to use paraphrase or specify most probable contextual meaning of the word (Baker, 2011). Here are some examples (underlines added): (1) a . I am conscious of my own identity. b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (2) a. It X  X  a serious situation if one loses b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (3) a. You can lose your identity when you join b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (4) a. They inevitably diminish the new individ-b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  The translators used their own interpretations in the context to explicate the meaning expressed by  X  X dentity X   X  e.g.,  X  X  X  cun zai  X  X xistence X  or  X  X eing X  in (1b),  X  X  ge xing  X  X n individual X  X  character or disposition X  in (2b) and (3b), and  X   X  ren ge  X  X anhood X  or  X  X ersonality X  in (4b). This indicates the absence of a cover term in Chinese to render Sense A of  X  X dentity X . Our sample also suggests other alternatives to render this sense  X  e.g.,  X  X  X  X  X  geren cunzai  X  X xist-ence of an individual X   X  as well as more adaptive translations such as  X  X  X  X  shiluo gan  X  X ense of loss X  to convey the fee ling of losing of one X  X  identity, and  X  X  X  X  X  yinxing maiming  X  X o hide one X  X  family and given na mes X  for the situation in which one purposely conceals of his identity. 
B1. Public identity . It tends to serve an in-strumental function  X  to single out an entity from a population by recognising its unique character-istics. Such characteristics are often physical, measurable, and operationalisable to a large scale of population. The typical collocations include identity card, proof of identity, digital identity, and identity parade. Unlike self-identity, such an identity can be designed, assumed or even stolen: (5) a. A credit card is not a valid proof b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (6) a. The journalist did not want to reveal b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (7) a. How do I report online fraud and identity b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ? (8) a. Managing digital identity is a critical is-b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (9) a. This lets you manage identity ranges man-b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (10)a. but for feeling certain that the man had no b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X 
Of the four senses of  X  X dentity X , this sense (B1) is most readily translatable into Chinese. There are 74 instances of Sense B1 in our sample. The most frequently used translations are  X  X  shen fen (n= 32) and  X  X  shen fen (n= 12)  X  both are pronounced identically and often used inter-changeably, although the first term tends to be used for identity card and documents (5), while the second for social status of a person or a legal person (6). A similar translation  X   X  X  X  X  X  shenfen jianbie  X  X uthenticating an identity X  (8)  X  is used twice in our sample, which emphasises more on the act of authenticating or appraising. Another translation  X   X  X  X  biao shi  X  X arking X  (9)  X  occurs seven times in our sample and ex-presses more technical meaning of marking out distinctive features. There are also several more adaptive translations in our sample, which ex-press the contextual meaning of  X  X dentity X , e.g.,  X  X  X  ren chu  X  X ecognising X  (10),  X  X  shi shui  X  X s who X , and  X  X   X  X s him X . 
B2. Distinctive characteristics . This sense, somehow related to Sense B1, reveals more dis-tinctive characteristics of an entity. The eight instances of Sense B2 tend to be translated into  X  X  te xing  X  X pecial features X ,  X  X  X  te zheng  X  X pecial characteristics X  (n= 3 for the two terms) and  X  X  X  xing xiang  X (special) image X  (n= 2). (11) a. The countries have kept their own distinct b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (12) a. Language and identity in Caribbean litera-b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (13) a. I want to design the corporate identity. b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X 
The terms  X  X  X  (11) and  X  X  (12) appear to be close equivalents in Chinese for Sense B2. 
C. Sameness . This sense of  X  X dentity X  points to sameness and identicalness between two enti-ties through rather objective or factual compari-son. It is not difficult to be translated into Chinese with several commonly used terms: (14) a. Identity of interests is the bond that unites b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (15) a. As to the cloning of dictators and celebri-b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  (16) a. Identity and continuity are not the same. b.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  Several terms are able to convey Sense C into Chinese:  X  X  yi zhi  X  X n agreement X  (14),  X  X  X  xiang tong  X  X ameness X  (15),  X  X  X  deng tong  X  X quality (16). Other alternative translations into Chinese include  X  X  X  tong yi  X  X nity X  and  X  ...  X   X  X  shi ... wei yiti  X  X aken as a unity X . 
Table 1 summarises our findings in and shows the most frequently u sed Chinese translations: This research demonstrates the value of parallel corpus for bilingual lexicon building. From par-allel language materials, the main senses of  X  X dentity X  emerged. Our results lend support to distinction between personal identity and public identity, a position advocated by John Locke (1632-1704) (see discussion by Richter and Song, 2005, p. 92). Our data showed that the former (Sense A in this study) points to a seman-tic vacuum in Chinese  X  an unlexicalised concept  X  while the latter can be readily translated into Chinese. From the perspective of frame seman-tics, when Chinese speakers have difficulty to establish a core (keyword) to a semantic network using Sense A of  X  X dentity X , they would have problem to perceive its associated words and col-locations, e.g., self, myself, individuality (Fill-more, Johnson, &amp; Petruck, 2003). However, based on our evidence from parallel corpora, alt-hough Sense A is not lexicalised in Chinese, par-allel corpora provide a variety of solutions that translators have used to solve the problem (cf. Table 1). Our investigation also reveals some constrains of using use parallel corpora. We have observed a few cases of typos, mistranslations, rather questionable adaptions in translation. The present study investigates the problem of unlexicalised concept in the target language in relation to the building of bilingual lexicon. Par-allel corpora demonstrate advantages of using real-life language materials to allow the main senses of the word in qu estion to emerge. Our results show the distribution pattern of the main senses of  X  X dentity X  and present the most fre-quently used terms in Chinese to render each sense. Such terms are candidates for English-Chinese lexicons. Our findings reinforce the pre-vious research that self-identity (Sense A in this study) is unlexicalised in the Chinese language and therefore can hardly be captured by a single cover term. It requires paraphrase or contextual-ised renditions as commonly used translation methods. By contrast, the other three senses of  X  X dentity X  are more readily translatable into Chi-nese. A variety of lexical items serve as close equivalents (cf. Table 1). The potential of using parallel corpus deserves to be explored in future studies in relation to the problem of bilingual corpus construction, machine translation and translator training.
