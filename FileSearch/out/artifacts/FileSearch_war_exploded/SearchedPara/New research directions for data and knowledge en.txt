 1. Introduction Suppose you live in Scotland or some  X  X old X  climate.  X  X  X ere you born in a tunnel? X  your mother asks as you enter the room.
While you might be tempted to reply humorously,  X  X  X o, in a hospital X , you know what she means and you turn back and shut the door. Tunnels are draughty places (and in other parts of Britain  X  X unnel X  is  X  X arn X  and in Sweden,  X  X hurch X ).
Ontologies and knowledge bases are often constructed from texts and attempt to model the meaning of the text. But this can be difficult when texts include such statements as this, because the meaning of the text is not immediately obvious from the words or phrases used (what we will call text-meaning), but must take account of how it is used in the lives of speaker or hearer (what we will call life-meaning).
This may be illustrated by the simple task of text retrieval. A user who wished to find texts that refer to the closing of doors would completely miss those that included  X  X  X ere you born in a tunnel? X  unless they possessed the life-knowledge that this idiom is sometimes used when  X  X  X lease shut the door X  is intended. Alternatively, a researcher might wish to deter-mine the frequency of use of various idioms for  X  X  X lease shut the door X , and again the life-meaning is essential to high quality text retrieval. However, once the idiom has become widespread in society, then the text retrieval search engine itself might learn that  X  X  X orn in a tunnel X  refers to door-closing.

This kind of semantic link lies at the root of Berners-Lee X  X  [6, p. 169] vision for the Web:  X  X  X achines become capable of analysing all the data on the Web  X  the content, links and transactions between people and computers. A  X  X emantic Web X , which should make this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines, leaving humans to provide the inspiration and intuition. The intelligent  X  X gents X  people have touted for ages will finally materialise X .
But will they? Should they? Winograd [64, p. 11] warns that such a vision is not only difficult but likely to be inappro-priate, and suggests,  X  X  X  key design issue: let people do the interpretation of natural language, and let the program deal with explicit declara-tions of structure X .

Life-meaning is one reason why Berners-Lee X  X  vision might be inappropriate
Life-meaning can affect at least the following tasks in data and knowledge engineering (DKE) that involve interpretation of lan-guage (spoken or written):
Knowledge base construction  X  If the knowledge engineer misunderstands what the domain expert says, the resulting knowledge base will misfunction, or at least mislead its users.

Ontology construction  X  It is important to find the exceptions as well as the average knowledge if the ontology is to be generally applicable, and many exceptions relate to human life.
 Intelligent agents  X  These should behave as human agents would in similar situations.
 Virtual worlds  X  They need to be believable in all respects.

Model checking and comparison  X  The tacit life-assumptions inscribed into each model can modify its intended meaning in major ways.

Information systems development (ISD)  X  Misunderstandings between members of the ISD team can arise from different assumed life-meanings.
 Life-meaning can also affect the following tasks in natural language processing (NLP):
Text understanding  X  Models and ontologies automatically derived from texts will be deficient unless the full meaning of texts is taken into account.

Text summarization, indexing and correction  X  Unless life-meaning is taken into account, summaries and indices might be misleading, and wrong corrections might occur.

Text generation  X  Text generated from models tends to be bland and boring if it states explicitly what is taken for granted by its readers and does not employ devices like humour.
 Machine translation  X  see the example in Section 2 !
If these tasks are to be applied in non-technical applications or those outside the professional arena, such as social net-working, virtual worlds or computer games, then life-meaning will be crucial to their success; as we shall see below, it can also be important in technical applications. If this list is at least partially correct, then the potential benefits of more pow-erful, computer-supported, partially automated NLP could be huge. We shall reflect on this point again in the conclusions.
Before the benefits can be reaped, we need to admit that it is by no means simple to explain how life-meaning could be taken into account. Understanding life-meaning in general is a prerequisite for addressing the more technical types of life-meaning encountered in some of the tasks above. In particular, it is now generally accepted that it is impossible to capture the entire meaning in rules or other structures expressed in a knowledge representation language. Much of the life-meaning, especially of the user, will be applied during the very act of interpreting the information presented by the computer system. In such cases, it is not necessary to encode the life-meaning in rules or structures within the computer system, supporting
Winograd X  X  view above. Regardless of whether life-meaning is encoded or is left to the user, it is important for researchers to understand how the life-meaning of texts (in the widest sense) affects human understanding and machine interpretations. It therefore needs to be made as explicit as possible. Very little research in DKE or NLP has tackled this and therefore it is an appropriate topic for this article.

Text analysis research is strongly influenced by what Winograd [64] calls the traditional perspective on language, which begins with syntax, ventures into semantics when this fails, and only then, and grudgingly, takes pragmatics into account.
This order is reversed for the Language/Action Perspective (LAP): first pragmatics, then semantics and lastly syntax. Lyytinen [37] briefly reviewed five major perspectives on language and argued that the perspective taken has major impacts on infor-mation systems (IS) research and information systems development (ISD). The significance of language perspectives for DKE and NLP has seldom been discussed.

The main purpose of this article is to make a strategic proposal that DKE/NLP research should be directed at approaches that can take life-meaning into account alongside text-meaning, and that taking certain perspectives on language might en-able this. Though primarily strategic in purpose, the article X  X  scope includes some suggestions that could be activated imme-diately; these help to clarify ideas and to illustrate potential practical relevance.

When advocating new directions in a field it is difficult to establish the need for it merely by reference to extant literature because that focuses on issues of importance to current approaches. In order to show the need for the proposed research strategy, Section 2 introduces four examples, to which this article will continue to refer throughout. These examples, three of which are drawn from outside the professional arena, highlight a number of issues that challenge DKE/NLP tasks and clar-ify the notions of life-meaning and text-meaning. Section 3 then introduces seven perspectives on language. The first four of these are restricted to text-meaning while the last three acknowledge life-meaning, while not denying the importance of text-meaning as well. Section 4 discusses how the various perspectives might enable DKE/NLP researchers to analyse the four examples. Section 5 makes some suggestions how the three life-meaning perspectives can open up new directions in
DKE/NLP research. The concluding section raises some broader issues that need attention when implementing the research strategy that is the main concern throughout this article: how can we understand texts properly? An answer to this question forms the foundation for most other NLP and DKE tasks at the semantic and pragmatic levels.

In this article the word  X  X ext X  is interpreted very broadly as in philosophical hermeneutics, to include not only formatted strings but also diagrams, gestures, speech, conversations, showing of pictures, and contents of databases and models  X  that is anything that can convey meanings to a user by means of symbols of any kind. 2. Difficulties in DKE/NLP without life-meaning
What are life-meaning and text-meaning and why is the issue important? The terms  X  X ife-meaning X  and  X  X ext-meaning X  call for clearer characterization. It is not our intention here to define them exhaustively, but merely to indicate the kinds of issues that are likely to be encountered in practice in the near future in the DKE and NLP communities in the light of tasks and types of application typical of DKE/NLP research.

Where within the existing discourse in the philosophy of linguistics can we locate life-and text-meaning? Morris [39] originally suggested that syntactics is the study of the relationship between signs and signs, semantics, of that between signs and their designata, and pragmatics, of that between signs and their interpreters. So text-and life-meaning might be seman-tics and pragmatics. However, from the perspective of research on human language since Morris (beginning with Wittgen-the relationship between semantics and pragmatics but, from our perspective, even Szab X  X  X  own definition, that semantics concerns linguistic meaning while pragmatics concerns the context of utterance, is not entirely appropriate, because we are concerned with more than context. We might, alternatively, tie life-meaning to Husserl X  X  analysis of consciousness as the locus of intention that is expressed through language use, to Schutz and Luckmann X  X  [45] notion of lifeworld, to Wittgen-stein X  X  [66] notion of language games that are associated with different roles or  X  X orms of life X , or a combination of the above.
The notion of forms of life is ambiguous, however, and not quite identical with what we mean by life-meaning. At this stage of language research we do not want to commit to specific definitions too early. Rather, each language perspective studied below should be free to address text-meaning and life-meaning in its own way as it advances the frontier of human language theories.

What may be said is that the terms life-meaning and text-meaning indicate two attitudes with which researchers and other interpreters might approach a text. Taking an attitude makes certain issues visible and important to study, taking an-other, makes others visible. Life-meaning refers to the meaning or significance that a text has within the life of human beings who engage with it, which cannot be derived from its text-meaning. Text-meaning refers to the (broadly agreed) meaning that a piece of text has without reference to how it might be used in actual live situations of diverse communities who en-gage with it. A rough, practical characterization of the difference is that much text-meaning can be encoded in a good lexicon that allows a rich diversity of lexical relationships, such as WordNet [38] , while most life-meaning cannot.
It may also be said that almost everywhere that text-meaning is important, life-meaning is also important. This is because our interest in text-meaning is an interest in the meaning a text has, and that inevitably involves life-meaning as well as text-meaning. That is, in most DKE and NLP research oriented to semantics, life-meaning can be important. Sometimes the life-meaning makes little difference, but in many places it can make a surprisingly substantial difference. 2.1. Some examples of importance of life-meaning
In order to clearly characterize the terms  X  X ife-meaning X  and  X  X ext-meaning X , we shall examine four examples, which illus-trate and demonstrate some of the issues that arise from omission of life-meaning in NLP or DKE and show why they are important. We will refer to these four examples throughout the article. Three are taken from texts, and one from an infor-mation system. The first is the one with which the article opened. The second example relates life-meaning directly to tra-ditional organisation-oriented information systems development. The third and fourth raise a number of more challenging and diverse issues, which, even if not currently researched, are likely to become a future focus. Aspects like humour and reli-gious belief are evident. Though not common in technical applications, these aspects are given attention here because they might be increasingly encountered in applications outside the professional arena and have so far received less attention than they deserve.

In the simple example,  X  X  X ere you born in a tunnel? X , some life-meaning lies in the intention of uttering it (getting the door closed). This cannot be derived from its text-meaning, a question about birth-place in which  X  X unnel X  might be a spec-ialised type of gynaecological technology; that this meaning of the question is not intended by the mother is obvious from the life-knowledge that mothers usually know where their children were born! Instead, the intended meaning employs idi-omatic use of words. Further, it would not be universally appropriate: if your mother were angry, she would most likely have ordered,  X  X  X hut the door! X .

The second example 2 is a library information system designed to process the borrowing and return of books. The concept of borrowing involves transferring some good from one person/institution to another, but with the rule that the good has to be brought back. Text-meaning includes such things as that the borrowing agent can never be a book [8] , or that one cannot return an item before it has been borrowed, and this can provide the basic knowledge from which to construct the IS, such as recording the episodes of lending and return.

However, to make it work well requires life-meaning. Life-meaning tells us that return is important, so the IS should help ensure returns. Life-experience tells us that people forget to return books, so the library system might send out reminders when books become overdue. Next, we find that this makes people angry because they must always pay fines, so the system is modified to send out reminders just before books become overdue. Further, there are cultures in which reminders might be inappropriate. In Japan, with its culture of status, it may be the case that returning goods does not apply to special persons of higher rank, so the automatic issuing of reminders would be inappropriate. In older  X  X entlemanly X  Western culture, it was considered a matter of honour and courtesy to return what was borrowed, so reminders were seldom needed. Thus the life-meaning of  X  X orrow X  depends on cultural expectations, assumptions and values. In such ways, life-meaning can impact on IS design. The difficulty is that when one designs an IS one might not be aware of how life-meaning will modify its require-ments, indicating that it is wise to build in cultural flexibility. Pace Berners-Lee (above), even  X  X ureaucratic X  tasks involve intuition; pace Winograd, it is sometimes useful for some of the life-meaning to be encoded in the program, as long as we are aware of cultural implications. 2.2. A more challenging example
For the third example, suppose that there was a need to investigate book titles, including the nature of the link between titles and book contents, by semantic analysis of book-seller websites. For Chomsky X  X  [9] Aspects of the Theory of Syntax , the link is obvious and directly inferable from the text-meaning of the title. For Lynne Truss X  [56] book, Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves , however, the link with contents is far from obvious. The website classifies the book as about punctuation, but this is not derivable from reading the title at first and looking at the cover. The cover shows a picture of a panda standing on a ladder. The back cover shows a picture of a panda with a gun and presents the following story:
A panda walks into a cafe. He orders a sandwich, eats it, then draws a gun and fires two shots in the air.  X  X hy? X  asks the confused waiter, as the panda makes towards the exit. The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.  X  X  X  X  a panda, X  he says, at the door.  X  X ook it up! X . The waiter turns to the relevant entry and, sure enough, finds an explanation: Panda. Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.
This strongly suggests the book should be about pandas, though perhaps fictitious ones. Then we notice more text on the back cover, further down and less conspicuous,  X  X  X o, punctuation really does matter, even if it is only occasionally a matter of life and death. This is the zero tolerance guide. X  and on the front cover, we now notice a relatively inconspicuous subtitle,  X  X  X he Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation X . (This was actually the sequence in which the author who contributed this example perused the covers.) So, the book is about punctuation. But why this title suits the book can only be ascertained by reference to life-meaning.

A semantic analysis of cover text (in which we might include the graphics, when graphical analysis becomes possible) would yield two guesses  X  that the topic is either pandas or punctuation  X  but how could one tell which it is? (The website information might be wrong.) Using methods sometimes employed in NLP suggests pandas: there is more text on the cover about pandas than about punctuation, and the most conspicuous material is about pandas; also, from a lexicon we might find that  X  X unctuation X  has special meaning in biology (punctuated evolution). Why the title suits a book on punctuation is still obscure.

That this is indeed a book about punctuation despite these reasons must be explained as follows, all of which are life-meaning and cannot be derived from text-meaning: that forceful words like  X  X ero-tolerance X  indicate something important, that in some styles of writing, it is the final, short sentence which contains the main message, that the story portrays a sit-uation which we know is unusual (shooting in a restaurant), and that humour can be used for the titles of popular books. The humour here, however, is not the normal play on words but employs an uncommon device: the title is an example of the problem, rather than an expression of the problem (the erroneous comma between  X  X ats X  and  X  X hoots X ). Above all, the title  X  X orks X  for this book because it is fun, and fun is appropriate to this kind of book. 2.3. A multi-layered example
Our fourth example is the most intricate, and has several levels at which it works, each level furnishing us with different examples of the need for DKE and NLP to take life-meaning into account. It is taken from the folklore in the classical liter-ature on the limits of machine translation dating back to the 1960s. The well-known phrase,  X  X  X he spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak X . was translated as  X  X  X he drinks are good but the meat is poor X .

We can easily see from homonym text-meaning why the mistranslation occurred:  X  X pirit X  can mean strong alcoholic drinks expected to be served at a party or, as it originally meant, inner human aspiration or good intention, and  X  X lesh X  can mean either meat (again as served at a meal) or the bodily desires that subvert our good intentions. But why is it that we also know that the translation is inappropriate? Why do those particular homonyms work? Why does it make us smile?
To understand this, we must understand the life-meaning of the statements at several levels: first, that of the original situation of  X  X  X he spirit is willing ...  X  (Jesus Christ and his disciples, 2000 years ago), then that of the Christian church and Western cultures, and finally those of the AI community and the authors of this article.

The original statement was spoken by Jesus Christ as part of an ongoing situation in the Garden of Gethsemane. There are two almost identical accounts of this situation in the New Testament, one found in Mark (Ch. 14, vv. 32 X 42), and one in Mat-thew (Ch. 26, vv. 36 X 46). Using text from the New International Version [42] , it is reproduced in full in order to discuss the relationship between an utterance and its context of use.  X  X Un] X  identifies the various utterances to be referred to below.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them,  X  X it here while I go over there and pray [U1]. X  He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them,  X  X y soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death [U2]. Stay here and keep watch with me [U3]. X 
Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed,  X  X y Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me [U4]. Yet not as I will, but as you will [U5] X .

Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping.  X  X ould you men not keep watch with me for one hour? [U6] X  he asked Peter.  X  X atch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation [U7]. The spirit is willing, but the flesh [U8] X .

He went away a second time and prayed,  X  X y Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done [U9] X .

When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing [U10].

Then he returned to the disciples and said to them,  X  X re you still sleeping and resting? [U11] Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. [U12] Rise, let us go! [U13] Here comes my betrayer! [U14] X .
We are attempting to find a way to process this portion of natural language that does justice to the meaning it expresses and thus accounts for why it is well-known in cultures that have been historically informed by Christianity.
In contrast with previous examples, the statement in which we are interested, [U8], contains neither idiom nor humour, and cultural assumptions do not greatly modify its text-meaning. It is still replete with life-meaning, however. Like the tun-nel example, its extra-lingual intention is not easily derived from its text-meaning. It is a statement of generic spiritual real-ity, but its purpose was to support the entreaty immediately preceding it, to  X  X  X atch and pray X . Peter had previously boasted of his loyalty, but here we find him sleeping rather than supporting Jesus by praying. Jesus believed he was thus in danger of weakening when under pressure (which is what actually occurred a little later).

However, another kind of life-meaning is evident: how speaker and hearer experience the utterance in the immediate situation of its use. According to this narrative, the life-situation in which the statement was spoken was an intense struggle of Jesus to submit to God X  X  will while he faced death by crucifixion and had to cope also with the failure of the disciples to support him. Was the statement a condemnation, or expression of annoyance? That is unlikely because the words carry a gentleness, an affirmation along with a challenge. As Babajide-Cole [4, p. 1197] remarks,  X  X  X f they are to avoid falling, they must watch and pray. Jesus conceded that in their spirit they really did want to stand with him, but they were prone to fail-ure because their bodies were weak. X  That Jesus could, in the midst of intense anguish, treat the friend who had disappointed him so positively is remarkable.

It this way, the affirmatory challenge may be felt by those outwith the situation to be not only a generic statement in-tended to support an entreaty, but also an example of an admirable attitude. This is perhaps why  X  X  X he spirit is willing ...  X , as part of a corpus of religious writing (the New Testament), has become famous in cultures informed by Christianity, which span the globe and are not confined to English-speaking ones (our second level of engaging with it). In this process its status as a generic theological assertion has predominated, namely that our good intentions can be compromised by bodily desires gious figure. In post-Christian cultures, we also frequently use it rather flippantly, to excuse ourselves when we allow our good intentions to be thwarted for whatever reasons.

The rationale for placing the original statement alongside its mistranslation (our third level) is to make the point that NLP exhibits flaws. This  X  X orks X  because of the humour, which itself depends on life-meaning in that (a) both spirit (as drink) and flesh (as meat) are what we might find at a social party (b) a light-hearted party contrasts incongruously with a revered reli-gious figure either speaking general theological statements (as Western culture has it) or engaged in an intensely serious situation (as the narrative has it).
 Finally, at a fourth level, its use in this article is to open up issues of life-meaning.

While we recognise that an example drawn from the sphere of religion might at first sight be unusual, we do not apol-ogise for this. Partly this is because most academic writings draw examples from professional life and, for our purposes, it is useful to escape the biases of the usual mould. It is also partly because such applications might become important in the near future; in these days in which the importance of religious faith has become more evident than it used to be and it might be vital that the developers of DKE/NLP methods properly understand faith-intention(s) and the type of text that is part of faith-conversations  X  if not, they would misunderstand, with potentially political consequences. We are not assuming any reli-gious faith on the part of the reader. 2.4. Issues related to life-meaning
The semantic difficulties in these four examples arise not only from subtleties of syntax or homonyms, but from their grounding in the lives of people. Life-meaning is a challenge because it can modify or even subvert the text-meaning. There are several ways in which it can do so.

The examples illustrate that life-meaning and text-meaning are not entirely independent of each other. Life-meaning depends on text-meaning (e.g. on the text-meaning of  X  X unnel X ), though the way it does so is not always straightforward.
Text-meaning is not some absolute property of the symbols but emerges over a period from life-meaning by intersubjective agreement. Thus the boundary between them is fuzzy, as reflected in the ongoing debate about the relationship between semantics and pragmatics [53] . Rather than entering that debate this article will focus on clear differences, identifying a number of issues that were encountered in the four examples.

From the tunnel example, we see that the meaning of an utterance can come more from its extra-linguistic intentions than from its text-meaning. There the life-meaning subverts text-meaning, but in the Gethsemane example  X  X  X he spirit is will-ing ...  X  it only modifies it. While such intentions have been recognised in DKE/NLP, the complexity of intentions has perhaps not been so widely recognised. The mother who utters  X  X  X ere you born in a tunnel? X  does not only want the door closed, but also has a secondary didactic intention, of reminding the child of what they should already have learned.

Idioms ( X  X  X orn in a tunnel X ) do subvert the text-meaning because their meaning is not derivable from the text-meaning of their parts, except by a logic that is not immediately obvious. If they are standard ones, then they might be incorporated into a lexicon, but idioms are dynamic and many micro-communities such as families use their own for short times, and onlook-ers might not even realise that an idiom is being used. Yet they can greatly alter the meaning of what is being heard or read.
What have received less attention are the situations in which idioms are appropriate or inappropriate, such as whether play-ful or angry. To recognise both extra-lingual intentions and idioms is important in the tasks of model building, text summa-rization and correction, and in knowledge engineering.

At the instant of use, a text not only has an extra-linguistic intention, but also an existential life-meaning , especially to its hearer or reader, which is how the utterance is experienced in the immediate situation of its utterance or use. Thus  X  X  X ere you born in a tunnel? X  is experienced by us as light-hearted, and  X  X  X he spirit is willing ...  X  was (we argued) experienced as
Existential meaning of a text (even a database record) can differ every time we engage with it and even for each participant in a social situation. By contrast, extra-lingual intention does not vary so much:  X  X  X ere you born in a tunnel? X  almost always means  X  X lease shut the door. X  Existential life-meaning is likely to be important in creating believable virtual realities and intelligence agents, in other modelling tasks and in making generated text more lively.

Cultural assumptions, expectations, values, aspirations, etc. (life and world views: LWVs) can also contribute to the mean-ing of words, utterances or even whole conversations. We would expect a mother to know where her child had been born.
We know that people  X  X orget X  to return books and so should be reminded  X  except perhaps for high-status Japanese. Cultural knowledge presents challenges. It is usually tacit or taken for granted, difficult to predict where and how it will prove impor-tant, and is highly diverse. Cultures encountered in the examples include the cold-climate family, the library profession, the community of popular authors who wish to make an impact, Jewish culture under Roman rule 2000 years ago, the cultures of the Christian church over the past 2000 years, modern academic life in artificial intelligence (which Adam [1, p. 179] char-acterizes as  X  X  X rivileged, white, middle-class, male X ) and that of the DKE and NLP communities for whom this paper is writ-ten. In DKE/NLP research it will not be sufficient merely to recognise the pertinence of cultural differences, collecting them on an ad-hoc basis. Rather, a well-grounded approach to understanding this diversity is needed.

Yet, despite the many cultural differences, we do seem able to understand something of other cultures; we can all empa-thise with Jesus X  anguish at trying to do the right thing and his disappointment when his friends did not support him. Is there some common, trans-cultural understanding ? In the library example, the difference between borrowing and giving or selling seems more fundamental than the need, or not, to send reminders. If so, then it would be useful to have a basis for exploring trans-cultural understanding.

Humour is found in the book title and the mistranslation, and much text in applications outside the professional arena makes use of it and presents major challenges to NLP. The essence of much humour is to go against cultural expectations, to the point of deliberate unintelligibility or even absurdity, and thus humour is often specific to a culture. Much humour in texts plays on words, but as we have seen in the book title, not all humour does. 2.5. Life-meaning in DKE/NLP Table 1 summarises how the issues above  X  and we cannot assume this is a complete list  X  are important to the DKE and
NLP tasks in various ways. In the examples we can detect at least three ways in which we might engage with a text, each of which brings a different life-meaning. as originator : writer or speaker, e.g. mother, Jesus; as user : reader, hearer or other recipient, e.g. disciples, the early AI community, the authors of this article; as recorder : archiver, editor or publisher, e.g. the gospel writers or Christian church.

In face-to-face conversation there need be no recorder. The recorder selects, collects and edits texts and stores them on a persistent medium for later use, including notes, databases, websites or corpuses like the New Testament. The purpose of storing, the recorders X  cultural background and their attitude while storing all contribute to the recorder life-meaning, and this affects not only editing but what is selected and what, omitted. IS designers are recorders.

While there is a considerable amount of work on text-meaning in the DKE and NLP communities, there is very little work on life-meaning. In an examination of the main papers in the 1999 edition of Advances in Automatic Text Summarization and in the proceedings of the 2004 and 2007 conference of Natural Languages Data Bases we did not find a single reference to authors whom we would have expected in discussions of life-meaning. In volumes 56 and 57 of Data &amp; Knowledge Engineer-ing , out of 632 references, only four referred to authors who might have any connection with life-meaning, and the reference to them was peripheral.

Typical of the focus on text-meaning is a recently reported system [54] to build domain ontologies by searching the Web, starting from a word like  X  X ancer X . It recognises that the Web exhibits high dynamicity, untrustworthiness and noise (from graphics, etc.) but assumes that, because of the Web X  X  size, statistical methods will average these out and obtain good do-main knowledge. Life-meaning is completely ignored. Their method promises to yield good averaged-out ontologies of a technical domain like medicine, but in non-technical domains in which idiom and humour abound, in applications where averaging out is not appropriate (such as knowledge based systems) and in situations where one wishes to obtain a good picture of what texts say rather than an ontology abstracted from them, their method is likely to by inappropriate. A sug-gestion for using their approach for life-meaning is made towards the end of this article.

Contrary to this trend, however, is the LIKE project (Linguistic Instruments in Knowledge Engineering), which was initi-ated by van de Riet [57] in the early 1990s and is still current. It is notable for two reasons. One is because it has attempted, over a long period, to bring DKE and NLP together. It has spawned a number of important ideas and tools, most of them motivated by interest in linguistic representations, owing to the inadequacy of knowledge representation formalisms for representing real-world knowledge [58] . Work that was motivated by this same interest, some formally part of the LIKE project, others not, ranged from theoretical exploration of the relationship between linguistic and domain knowledge [22] , and of Dik X  X  [16] Functional Grammar [8,58] , extending Sowa X  X  [50] Conceptual Graphs [34,41] , to devising methods for constructing models from text [8,21] , devising a Conceptual Prototyping Language [51] and creating better lexicons for NLP such as enhancing WordNet [12] . (See also the article  X 25 years of Mokum X  in this special issue.)
The other is that some strands of its work do recognise some aspects of life-meaning which we discuss below and refer to primary authors like Searle and Habermas. However, with the current state of theoretical foundations in text analysis it is difficult to do justice to life-meaning. Even conceiving of any research that might make it possible to do so in the future in-volves understanding the various perspectives on language that could govern our research. For this reason, we now intro-duce a number of perspectives on language, and then discuss their potential in tackling life-meaning issues. 3. Perspectives on language
Lyytinen [37] presented a very useful outline of five major perspectives on what language is, discussing briefly the impli-cations for IS research, which he called: Fregean core Chomskian Cognitive Behaviourist (Skinnerian) Ordinary speaking (based on Austin and Searle X  X  Speech Act Theory).

A main message of his paper was that the perspective which he called  X  X rdinary speaking X  is very different from the others and the most important for IS researchers to adopt. What differentiates it from others for us is that it begins to acknowledge life-meaning. Twenty years have passed since then, and it has become clear that his  X  X rdinary speaking X  category is not homogeneous. At least two more perspectives on it can now be found, thus rendering three language perspectives that can take life-meaning into account, albeit in different ways and to differing degrees: the Language/Action Perspective and a perspective derived from the Cosmonomic Philosophy of Dooyeweerd.

We will briefly examine each of these seven perspectives on language, drawing on various sources, but especially on [37] , to which the reader is referred for more on the first five perspectives. 3.1. Fregean core perspective
Gottlob Frege was a mathematician who was fascinated by the question of how and why mathematical symbols can stand for (signify) anything, and his explorations of this made a contribution to the theory of language. Frege saw language as a vehicle to express logical reasoning, denoting things in the world and valid processes of reasoning about them. He is famous for highlighting, and struggling with, the difference between sense and reference tence is determined by the meaning of its parts).

The perspective on language that Frege pioneered sees language working in terms of entities, propositions, predicates, denotations and truth-values  X  and this view is common in information systems; so Lyytinen dubbed it the Fregean Core perspective.

This perspective is stamped with the precision of a mathematician, and it does not matter whether the language is of indi-viduals or of groups (which is an advantage over the next three perspectives). But a too-narrow focus on truth value of sen-tences that assert something makes it difficult for this perspective to acknowledge directive commands, fictional things, or language constructs like synonyms. The Fregean core perspective completely ignores life-meaning, because it completely ignores the human being and focuses entirely on the symbols and the world they denote, and thus provides us with no basis even on which to differentiate human from non-human. 3.2. The Chomskian perspective of transformational, generative grammar
Chomsky X  X  perspective is, from one viewpoint, the opposite of the Fregean, in that it recognises the human. He held that language is a (supervening) property of the state of a certain system that is found in all human minds/brains, which he called the language system. As the language system develops, so the language of that individual develops. This language,  X  X -lan-guage X , is purely internal to the individual. He acknowledges an external, E-language, which is social in nature, but he held the dogma that only the I-language is a proper object of study (as do his fellow internalists, the connectionists [7] ). To this study, the only significance of the external world is that it impinges on the individual and thus contributes to the develop-ment of the I-language.

This perspective is more comfortable accounting for how language expresses fictions and uses pronouns. Language need not express logic, but merely concepts  X  where the word  X  X oncept X  is a short-hand label supervening on a particular state of part of the mind/brain. Chomsky X  X  [9] contribution to work on syntax has been enormous, but his internalist view drove him to the conclusion that  X  X  X t is possible that natural language has only syntax and pragmatics X  [10, p. 132] , and thus deny, or at best ignore, semantics. Further, by focusing on the (brain processes of the) speaker, the Chomskian perspective can find it difficult to give due attention to the hearer and to treat texts as such as objects of study, for example, ancient documents, which is a basic prerequisite of NLP research.

At first, this perspective might appear to acknowledge life-meaning, because it recognises the human being. In fact, how-ever, it does not; it recognises only psychological processes of brains.  X  X xternalists X  like Dummett [18,19] cited by [7] argue that it cannot easily recognise the possibility that we can be mistaken about the meanings of words in our language (of which examples abound on web pages). Neither can it do justice to issues like the suppression of minority languages by so-cial elites or dictators, where the language is independent of any particular speaker. Chomsky replied [10, p. 49] , not with argument, but by simply ruling such  X  X  X ociopolitical, historical, cultural and normative-teleological X  issues out as  X  X  X omplex and obscure ... they plainly lie far beyond any useful inquiry into the nature of language or the psychology of users of lan-guage. X  Yet these are the very issues that can be important in life-meaning tasks. 3.3. Cognitive perspective
What Lyytinen calls the cognitive perspective sees language as a cognitive activity, but at a higher level than Chomsky al-lows. It is not restricted by Chomsky X  X  dogma that concepts are nothing more than (short-hand labels for) brain patterns, but it presupposes the notion of concepts with semantics rather than exploring and explaining it. It recognises cognitive structures, such as cognitive maps, and takes account of such psychological phenomena as memory and intelligence. The main interest of this perspective is not in language as such but to develop a theory of cognition, one major application of which happens to be to language. Piaget [43] was a main developer of this perspective, and Lindsay and Norman [36] were a major developer of this view in relation to knowledge representation in computers. Research carried out under this perspective tends to be descriptive and empirical, and is governed by the criterion of explanatory capacity. Like the Chomskian perspective, it focuses on the indi-vidual rather than the group, but unlike it, is interested in the reader/hearer as well as the the writer/speaker.
The cognitive perspective sees the human being as mentally active agent and the language produced is an expression of the mental activity. While one might argue that the mental activity is an expression of the life of the human being, this per-spective provides no basis for differentiating text-meaning from life-meaning. 3.4. Behaviourist perspective
The behaviourist perspective arises from the work of Morris [40] and Skinner [48] , and sees language as just one type of behaviour: language as a type of stimulus and a type of response. It thus shares with the cognitive perspective a focus on psychology and sees language as just one among several types of behaviour of the individual, though it does so at the behavi-ourist rather than the cognitive level. When it addresses language, research driven by this perspective focuses on the rela-tionship between language and observable behaviour, and the linguistic elements this research recognises are linguistic stimuli and responses, and contexts of stimulus-response pairs.

The behaviourist perspective likewise makes no difference between life-and text-meaning. Language is seen as some-thing that results from our responses or which stimulates us. Text is seen as no different in principle from environmental stimuli such as physical knocks. One might argue that therefore language is seen as part of life and thus must involve life-meaning but, even more than the Chomskian and cognitive perspectives, it fails to provide any basis on which to differ-entiate between life-and text-meaning, because it finds it difficult to even consider meaning as such. Though Lyytinen [37] suggested that it works at the level of semantics, it is probably more accurate to say that it works at the lexical level. 3.5. Speech act theory
What Lyytinen called the  X  X rdinary speaking X  perspective is largely speech act theory as developed by Austin [3] and refor-mulated by Searle [46] . It is the first of three that are differentiated from the above four in that they provide a basis for addressing issues of life-meaning.

Speech act theory (SAT) sees language as human action, with not just locutionary intention (the meaning of the words used) but illocutionary intention (what the speaker or writer intended to achieve by making the utterance). This is very like the extra-lingual intention in our examples. In SAT, text-meaning is accounted for by locutionary intention, and life-meaning by illocutionary. While Austin drew attention to this latter (which he called performative intention), Searle delineated a sounder classification of five main possible types of illocutionary intention: To assert that something is the case.

To make a promise or other commitment of the speaker. To direct the hearer to take some action.
 To declare some social state into being (e.g. a marriage).
 To express feelings.

For Searle, language X  X  primary function is to foster social interaction. The elements with which it concerns itself are the speech act itself (or utterance; this might or might not coincide with sentences), its illocution and the context. Speech act theory enables us to differentiate between defective and successful speech acts by means of normative rules. Research in-formed by this perspective seeks to understand intentions and may be judged by the completeness and consistency of rules it recognises.
 In addition to Austin and Searle, Lyytinen cites the later Wittgenstein [66] as another proponent of this view of language. Wittgenstein X  X  notion of language games  X  that language use is a like a game we play  X  corresponds reasonably well with
Searle X  X ustin speech acts, but is more abstract and less functionalistic. Lyytinen X  X  treatment focuses more on speech acts than on language games.

SAT is, however, limited in its treatment of life-meaning since its focus is on the individual utterance, rather than on-going life of the human beings involved. It also focuses on the originator rather than the user or recorder.  X  X rdinary speech X  is more subtle and diverse than would be allowed for under speech act theory. 3.6. The language-action perspective
The Language-Action Perspective (LAP) was initiated by Goldkuhl and Lyytinen [24] but it was Winograd and Flores X  clas-sic work  X  X nderstanding Computers and Cognition: A New Foundation for Design X  [65] , which became its flagship. Its view of language has attracted attention in various IS communities, culminating in a special issue of the Communications of the ACM in 2006 devoted to  X  X wo Decades of the Language Action Perspective X  [59] . Like SAT, the LAP treats language as part of human life, but whereas SAT focuses on single acts and individual utterances, the key notion of the LAP is that utterances are part of on-going conversations or other social activity and so cannot be understood properly apart from this activity. This implies the importance of shared understanding of meaning and of communities to create it.
 Hirschheim et al. [30] provide a good overview of the LAP, especially in relation to IS development. They stress its root in
Habermas X  [26,27] theory of communicative action, which itself incorporates SAT. From TCA comes a distinction between
Rational action is founded on reason as evidenced through knowledge of proper evidence as established by maximal criti-cism in informed debate. X  Rational social action may be undermined by inability to obtain proper information, by subjective bias (including lack of understanding) and by distortions due to conflicts of interest, power relations or unjust social conditions.

Habermas suggests that in rational social action our use of language is directed to three distinct  X  X orlds X  (the external world of objective facts and objects, the internal subjective world, and the external social world, presumed to be shared by the community in question). Each world direction implies a criticisable claim to validity (respectively, truth , sincerity and social or moral appropriateness ). For example,  X  X  X ere you born in a tunnel? X , is valid in all three ways: factually referring to the open door, sincerely expressing mother X  X  wish for it to be shut, and appropriate to the family situation (it would have been inappropriate in a formal situation). Only when these validity claims are met, suggests Habermas, can conversation theory of Universal Pragmatics.
 Habermas [26] delineates a number of basic types of social action:
Instrumental action on (physical) objects to achieve given ends. Objects in this context are inanimate or treated as if the were inanimate (animals, prisoners, anonymous masses).

Strategic action is making a claim to power to get people that are assumed to have the same rational capabilities as we ourselves to do what we want; primary example: warfare.

Communicative action, by which mutual understanding is sought. (Discursive action is sometimes differentiated from communicative action on the grounds that it involves suspending the ongoing conversation topic in order to give expla-nations or arguments that may be needed to restore the background prerequisites for maintaining intelligibility and acceptance of what is has being said.) Normatively regulated action, which is constrained by socially agreed values and norms;
Dramaturgical action, by which we choose to reveal something from our inner (subjective) world by expressing ourselves to others. It is constrained by primarily focusing on the speaker X  X  inner world and usually presumes an understanding audience (in contrast to instrumental action).

Communicative action is the least constrained of all types of social action, its only constraints being the four validity con-ditions above.  X  X  X ommunicative action X  says Habermas [27, p. 120]  X  X  X elies on a cooperative process of interpretation in which participants relate simultaneously to something in the objective, the social, and the subjective worlds X . In this cooperative process, participants draw upon  X  X  X  reservoir of taken-for-granteds, of unshaken convictions X  [27, p. 124] . Habermas [27, p. 121] illustrates this with an example of a junior worker at a construction site in Bavaria being sent for beer during a morning snack break. The validity of this situation rests on three types of concrete assumptions [27, p. 122] :  X  X  X lement[s] of the objec-tive world X , such as that either the nearby shop is open on Mondays or the junior has a car, a  X  X  X ormative component of the social world X , such as Bavarian cultural values (mid-morning beer at work would be totally unacceptable in Anglo-saxon society), and a  X  X  X rivate element of a subjective world X , such as degree of thirst.

Habermas calls this reservoir of shared background meanings the lifeworld; it is a background, shared understanding by which we interpret things and whatever is said. 5 The lifeworld differs from the other three worlds in that we do not direct ourselves towards it from the outside, as it were, but rather orientate ourselves within it [27, p. 126] . This means that while we can talk or write about objective things, inner feelings and social/moral norms, we cannot do so about  X  X hings X  in the life-world. The lifeworld remained to Habermas a mysterious thing that evaporates as soon as we try to take it up with our thinking.
This is why lifeworldy meanings have a background character. For the LAP, the lifeworld is of central importance in explaining the meaning of utterances.

Winograd [64] propounds a specific version of the LAP, in which conversation is the main type of social action. He illus-trates it with the example of the conversation of nurses about the care of a patient, which included reporting the patient X  X  state to each other, deciding which information to trust, negotiating changes in treatment, prompting for a forgotten test, investigating why medicine had not been delivered and finding out why a test was needed. Just as SAT delineates five types and for orientation . These types are referred to later. For each type a different model is appropriate, and Winograd develops the model for an action conversation, allowing for utterances that request, decline, accept, promise, counter and declare complete. Hoppenbrouwers and Weigand [31] also examine conversations for clarification.
 We conclude this section with a review of some criticisms of the LAP. Weigand [59] cites Suchman [52] as criticising the LAP for ignoring issues of power, ambiguity and tacit knowledge. Her criticism might be misdirected, however, because both
Hirschheim et al. [30] and Hoppenbrouwers and Weigand [31] discuss the relevance of the LAP to power relations and tacit knowledge. The former suggest two criticisms of their own [30, p. 231] : the concepts of speech acts and conversations are not sufficiently well-defined, and there have been practical problems in applying them. These problems, presumably, can be resolved, given time.
 There might be, however, more fundamental limitations inherent in the LAP, which affect its applicability to DKE/NLP. The LAPassumes X  X  X eopleactthroughlanguage X  [64]  X  X ndthusitcannotaddresssocialactioninwhichcommunicationisminimal.
It assumes rational social action, in which critique of validity claims is important  X  and thus provides no basis for addressing social action that might be deemed irrational or for which the validity claims might be irrelevant. It assumes the kinds of language use that are designed to facilitate logical argument ( [30] stresses the role of generation and exchange of evidence, and [31] assumes definition and argument will be central). As a result, it is not surprising that much application of LAP is in organisational settings, with a focus on coordination and commitments [15] . A consequence of this is that the LAP, as currently constituted, might not yet be able to provide us with a basis for understanding such things as poetry, humour, worship, games or social networking. These possible limitations are thrown into sharp relief by the seventh perspective, derived from
Cosmonomic Philosophy (short: DCP). It may help to overcome the limits in the way in which the LAP defines rationality. 3.7. Perspective derived from Cosmonomic Philosophy
The late Herman Dooyeweerd (1894 X 1977), a mid-twentieth century Dutch philosophical thinker, pioneered Cosmonom-ic Philosophy. He did not himself construct a perspective on language, but one may be derived from his philosophy that acknowledges life-meaning, but does not assume that all human life can be seen in terms of language or tacit background knowledge.

Because much of Dooyeweerd X  X  work and the debate surrounding it are in Dutch, good material in English is scarce (though two useful summaries are [5] and [11] ). Therefore we must explain something of Dooyeweerd X  X  philosophy before we can outline a perspective on language derived from it. Though Dooyeweerd X  X  thrust was to counter the reductionism of his day in ways that thinkers of that period would understand, Smith [49, xiii] insisted that Dooyeweerd should be viewed as a  X  X roto-postmodern X  theorist. Because of Dooyeweerd X  X  focus on diversity and his worked-out position that reason is fun-damentally unable to produce any grand narrative, Smith ventured,  X  X  X ndeed, perhaps it is only now that we can begin to read
Dooyeweerd. X  3.7.1. Dooyeweerd X  X  approach in philosophy
Dooyeweerd X  X  main work, A New Critique of Theoretical Thought [17] was first published in 1955 in four volumes. Volume I contains an extensive immanent critique of 2,500 years of theoretical and philosophical thinking. He argued that the philo-sophical ground on which most Western thought stands is shaky because of the kinds of deep presuppositions on which it rests. This critique would include Searle and Habermas. He proposed a new philosophic approach to such issues as meaning, knowledge, being, time, functioning, normativity, theory, practice and social structures. His approach is useful to us because at its very root it provides grounds for treating life-meaning and the lifeworld as important (though he never used those terms). We will briefly set out here the parts of his thought essential for the purposes of this article, bypassing much else.
Dooyeweerd X  X  philosophy suggests to us that we should approach the issue of language from a direction completely dif-ferent from all six previous perspectives. While they begin with the phenomenon of language as such and seek to understand it, Dooyeweerd began with everyday reality, of which language is part. On the basis of Dooyeweerd X  X  critique of Western thought, we could examine the roots of the problems in the previous perspectives, and would find two principle criticisms: reductionism  X  an undue narrowing of the focus onto certain aspects, resulting in the perspective being unable to address many of the life-meaning issues encountered in real-world texts  X  and over-theorizing. The latter leads to assuming a too abstract attitude in trying to understand language. This likewise prevents us from being open to the diversity of the life-world. As has been seen, even the LAP is affected by this because of the Kantian heritage in Habermas X  thinking. Our purpose here, however, is not to critique with the intent of competing with and ultimately replacing existing language perspectives.
Rather, our goal is to provide a vantage point from which the biases of SAT and the LAP can be addressed in future research.  X  X  X f I consider reality as it is given in the na X   X  ve pre-theoretical experience ...  X  wrote Dooyeweerd [17, p. I:3] at the very start of his New Critique , inviting his readers to do the same. We thus begin by attempting to understand reality, our shared knowledge of which we have called the lifeworld, rather than by understanding any particular aspect of it such as language or logic. Most of what Habermas said of the lifeworld  X  its background character, its intersubjective nature, and so on  X  can be substantiated in Dooyeweerd, but such philosophical discussion would be of little help to DKE/NLP research. Instead, we will focus on one main difference, which leads to the part that is most useful to us.

Habermas X  view prevented him from asking what the contents of the lifeworld are, because he believed that to speak about something you need to stand outside the  X  X orld X  to which it belongs. Dooyeweerd did not make that assumption, and so we are able to speak (or write) about lifeworld contents. The difficulty to which Habermas alludes is real, but it lies not in language itself but in the attitude we take when we use language  X  a theoretical or pre-theoretical attitude. In the theoretical attitude, we  X  X tand over against X  some aspect of reality (Dooyeweerd used the term  X  Gegenstand  X ) and it becomes, to us, a distinct  X  X orld X  seen, in Habermas X  terms, from the  X  X utside X . Habermas X  three  X  X orlds X  (objective, social, subjective) might correspond approximately to three aspects of reality which Dooyeweerd delineated (analytical, social, psychic; see below for fuller list).

In the pre-theoretical attitude, we engage with all the aspects instead of standing over against them. We are usually unaware of them  X  echoing Habermas X  notion of being  X  X nside X . To Dooyeweerd, this lifeworld is not a separate world; it is a pre-theoretical attitude to reality, which accommodates all the aspects thereof. A theoretical attitude separates aspects from each other conceptually, but the aspects resist such separation because each is inextricably intertwined with the others. 3.7.2. Dooyeweerd X  X  notion of aspects
The notion of aspects is not unique to Dooyeweerd. Most thinkers speak of aspects when they want to make distinctions among things that cannot be reduced to each other. Adam [1, p. 180] uses the term informally  X  X  X he way that a number of aspects of knowing are not reducible to propositional knowledge, ...  X  Even Habermas uses the term [27, p. 126] : X  X  ... singles out above two aspects of ... the teleological aspect ... the communicative aspect ...  X . Thinking aspectually is so natural that we usually take it for granted.

Dooyeweerd, however, addressed the nature of aspects, their intertwinement and the possibility of separating them out conceptually. This enabled him (and invites us) to do what Habermas was prevented from doing, namely to ask what aspects are there with which we engage in the lifeworld attitude. Theoretical thought might separate them out but can never arrive at any final, complete suite of aspects [17, II:556] . Nevertheless, from a lifetime of sensitive reflection (together with some philosophical techniques to test this, described in [5] ), Dooyeweerd delineated fifteen such aspects, each of which expresses a distinct kernel meaning: quantitative aspect: amount spatial aspect: continuous extension kinematic aspect: moving physical aspect: fields, energy and mass biotic aspect: life functions psychic aspect: feeling, and consequently responding analytic aspect: making distinctions; conceptualizing; logic formative aspect: deliberately shaping things, setting goals, planning, achieving lingual aspect: signifying by means of symbols social aspect: relating to others with respect economic aspect: managing limited resources with frugality aesthetic aspect: fulfilling the harmony in things with surprise, play, beauty, etc. juridical aspect: ensuring each receives their due; appropriateness ethical aspect: giving of self without expectation of reward pistic (faith) aspect: being committed to a vision of who we are and what is Ultimate.

The kernel meaning of each aspect is surrounded by a constellation of related meanings. While such a suite of aspects cannot be taken as any final truth, there are good reasons to adopt Dooyeweerd X  X  suite when considering issues in IT/IS [5] . We will adopt his suite here.

Later we will find it useful to employ the aspects as categories, but to Dooyeweerd they are much more than that. They are spheres of meaning that define distinct types of rationality, and also enable the entire cosmos to Be, and they are spheres of law that enable the cosmos to Occur and which guide the cosmos toward the Good. While they are irreducibly distinct (which is why they are useful to form categories), they are also inherently interwoven with each other in relationships of dependency and analogy, so that as we function in one aspect we cannot but function also in all the others simultaneously. All human activity is multi-aspectual. Dooyeweerd extends Winch X  X  [61] idea of multiple rationalities.

All things, especially those that resulted from human activity, exhibit all aspects. For example, a poem functions forma-tively (it has structure), lingually (it is writing), economically (frugal use of words), aesthetically (harmony of style and play on words), juridically (copyright), and so on. Certain aspects, however, are more important than others: the poem can still be a poem without copyright, but would hardly be a poem at all if it were not aesthetic writing. The aesthetic and lingual as-pects seem particularly important for a poem, though in different ways. The lingual aspect refers to the  X  X aterial X  of which the poem is made, the process by which it came into being; Dooyeweerd called this its founding aspect . The aesthetic aspect refers to the type of normativity that determines its quality and its further development as a poem; Dooyeweerd called this its qualifying aspect . With this aspect-based notion of thingness, Dooyeweerd was able to account for our intuitive notion of the nature of things without positing a Kantian thing-in-itself or relying on Aristotelian substance concepts, for types and subtypes, for being, becoming and ceasing to be, and much more.
Dooyeweerd believed that the kernel meaning of the aspects can never be penetrated by theoretical thought, but can be grasped by our intuition. For example, we can never define justice but intuitively know what it is. He saw reality as having two sides, the law side, which is the aspects, and which governs the cosmos and enables it to Be and Occur in all its diversity of meaning, 7 and the subject side, which is the entire cosmos as it actually exists and occurs, we know them, such as in the USA Constitution, are subject-side because they have concretely occurred as part of the historico-legal functioning of the cosmos, and the learned intuition that most US Americans share about this is of a different kind from the intuitive grasp of aspectual meaning. This offers the idea of law-side and subject-side types of intuition, which is useful below.
This brief explanation of a tiny portion of Dooyeweerd X  X  philosophy is enough to give us a perspective on language. Doo-yeweerd himself did not develop one, but demonstrated how a perspective in a scientific area might be developed by doing not be seen as a full philosophy of language. 3.7.3. Deriving the DCP perspective
When we attempt to understanding text, Dooyeweerd would recommend that we begin not by examining the thing that is text, nor any one aspect thereof, but by considering the whole multi-aspectual coherence of reality. The human activity of speaking, writing, hearing, reading, editing and so on is to be seen as multi-aspectual human functioning that is qualified by the lingual aspect (that is, in which the activity of signifying is of primary importance). Except for such things as private scribbling, most of this activity exhibits a strong social aspect, suggesting a secondary qualifying aspect (the social).
Life-meaning is accounted for by reference to this multi-aspectual functioning, and text-meaning by the lingual signification with its social overtones. The arrows in Fig. 1 show life-meaning and text-meaning as two ways in which text relates to the aspects: functioning and signifying.

Text is a product of, or object involved in, this lingually qualified multi-aspectual functioning. Dooyeweerd X  X  approach to thingness allows at least three levels of qualification for text objects: text as such: lingually qualified with social overtones text for a particular (social) purpose (reminiscent of Winograd X  X  types of conversation and Habermas X  action types): qual-ified by the aspect(s) related to that purpose each utterance in the text: qualified by yet another aspect that determines its role(s) in the above.

This can account for, and help us analyse, the extra-lingual intentions of text. Table 2 illustrates such an analysis of the utterances in the Gethsemane example. For most text objects the founding aspect is the lingual because text comes into being by lingually qualified activity (the multi-aspectual functioning of its originator). This is the most frequent case but
Table 3 below shows the aesthetic can sometimes be the founding aspect.
How a thing (e.g. a text) is actually used or experienced in a given concrete situation need not be restricted to the qual-ifying aspect, however. Our concrete experience of a thing is multi-aspectual, and includes, for example our feeling while engaging with the text, our distinguishing, our planning, our social respect or otherwise, and our ethical attitude. This can account for existential life-meaning. Humour may be seen as a combination of the above in which the aesthetic aspect is particularly important.

Lingual signification directs itself to the meaning of any and all aspects, as depicted in the right-hand arrows of Fig. 1 . This allows structured thoughts to be set down outside of, and to have a separate existence from, their originator, and as a result they can be shared with others or stored for later. Each text unit (word, phrase, utterance, etc.) may be used by its originator to express any desired meaning  X  though never fully  X  and, to be understood by others there must be mutual agreement about what each unit signifies and how it may be used. This applies also to idioms like  X  X  X orn in a tunnel X . The social process of agreeing and codifying such rules (e.g. in a dictionary) is multi-aspectual, involving especially the analytic, lingual, social and juridical aspects, and at first involves Gegenstand . Later the usage becomes taken for granted in a particular cultural con-text, and we engage with the units in a pre-theoretical attitude, employing them without analytical thinking. Many words express meaning of (are qualified by) one aspect. Utterances are more richly multi-aspectual but likewise have a qualifying aspect, which may be analysed as shown in Table 2 . This is a brief account of text-meaning.

The process of internalisation ( Gegenstand to engagement) also applies to life-meaning usage of texts; for example we learn that  X  X  X ere you born in a tunnel? X  is not for formal situations. This accounts for the culture-specific lifeworld as under-stood by the LAP. Dooyeweerd however offers an additional type of lifeworld, a different type of background understanding, which we all share. This is our intuitive grasp of the kernel meaning of the aspects, and it constitutes a trans-cultural background understanding, which remains behind the culture-specific background, even when occluded by it. Thus the above-mentioned law-side and subject-side intuitions might provide us with the possibility of both trans-cultural and culture-specific background understanding.

All the elements of Habermas X  example (shops shut on Mondays, Bavarian culture, degree of thirst, and so on) are concrete (subject-side), and Habermas seems to take it for granted throughout his discussion of the lifeworld in [27] that they will be. However, we can also detect Dooyeweerd X  X  proposed law-side intuitive grasp of aspectual meaning in Habermas X  example.
Behind the cultural assumption that it is the junior worker who goes for beer lies a kernel norm of the social aspect, of re-spect. In the Bavarian construction industry it takes the specific form of junior-senior respect; in other cultures it might take a different form.

Many cultural life-and-world-views (LWVs) arise from, and are constituted in, the elevation of a single aspect. weerd X  X  [17] ,I:120] examples included philosophical ones like Intellectualism, Aestheticism, Mysticism, Moralism, but we can also see aspectual elevation in cultures in organisations, such as those of the legal and financial departments. Words and other absolutizing it, the more other aspects are made invisible, resulting in people talking past each other.

The application of Dooyeweerd X  X  thought to information systems is relatively recent (see [5] for an overview), but it is attracting interest because it is characterized by an interdisciplinary attitude and a focus on the meaningfulness of things, including technical things, in life and cosmos, which transcends the human. 3.8. Overview What SAT offers to enable us to address issues of life-meaning is Language as individual acts with illocutionary intention, which cannot be derived from locutionary intention. The issues that the LAP would draw our attention to are Language as social action (Habermas) or conversation (Winograd); Rationality and critique of validity claims; Lifeworld as shared background understanding.
 The notions that DCP would draw our attention to, in addition to those above, are Language as multi-aspectual human functioning;
A well-thought-out suite of aspects that guide, and give meaning to, such functioning  X  especially a lingual aspect con-cerned with symbolic signification (text-meaning), a social aspect concerned with shared meanings, respect and institutions; Each aspect indicates a distinct type of meaning that can be signified.

Two types of background shared understanding (lifeworld), namely trans-cultural law-side and culture-specific subject-side.
How these are useful to DKE/NLP will be explored, first by examining the examples raised in Section 2 , then by making some practical proposals for DKE/NLP research based on each of the three life-meaning perspectives. 4. Example analyses
The purpose of this section is to discuss what insights might be revealed by each of the perspectives when applied to the four examples portrayed earlier. By their nature, perspectives do not of themselves give us answers about meaning of texts, but each perspective directs us to ask certain questions of the text by making certain types of things meaningful. It is by ask-ing the perspective X  X  questions that we might find answers about the meaning of texts. The first two examples are straight-forward but the other examples are more challenging. 4.1.  X  X  X ere you born in a tunnel?  X 
The Fregean Core perspective directs us to determine the referents of individual words or phrases ( X  X orn X ,  X  X unnel X , etc.) and employ the principle of compositionality to deduce the meaning of the whole utterance. But this hides the possibility of it meaning  X  X  X lease shut the door X . Though Frege recognised that sense is different from reference, because he did not define it, this cannot help us ask the appropriate questions that might lead us to its life-meaning.

Neither can the Chomskian perspective, because it directs us to see the utterance as a property of brain patterns of the speaker  X  what our mother was thinking at the time. It directs to ask about the structure rather than meaning of the text, so the Chomskian approach cannot arrive at the text-meaning, let alone the life-meaning. The Skinnerian perspective is, like-wise, of little help, because its view that language is merely a response or stimulus provides no basis on which to explore language as language.

The Cognitive perspective directs us to map out the concepts and their relationships, perhaps, by reference to the wider map of the whole situation. It provides, however, no grounds for thinking that mother X  X  question means anything other than its text-meaning. None of these first four perspectives can direct us to questions which would reveal the life-meaning.

SAT however does do so. It directs us to ask what is the illocutionary intention of the statement. It introduces the possi-bility that life-meaning might be completely different from text-meaning. But this might be as far as SAT is able to go. The illocution appears from its text-meaning to be assertive, but we know it is directive. SAT on its own does not provide any good means of determining this.

The LAP takes us further, because it directs us to ask what the social action or conversation is, whether it is valid (in four ways) and what the shared background knowledge might be. It is clearly a conversation for action and a normatively regu-lated social action. By reference to the cold climate and open door, it could suggest the utterance might relate to these, and by reference to cold-climate background understanding about open doors giving draughts which make us cold and coldness being unpleasant, we can arrive at the possibility that the utterance is a request to shut the door. It can handle the special uses of phrases by micro-communities like families. The LAP can also recognise that the request to shut the door ( X  X ere you born in a tunnel? X ) might not just be to prevent mother feeling cold, but might be part of a wider conversation that includes confidential material which others should not hear  X  hence the need to shut the door. Finally, we can test the validity claims.
As already mentioned, the statement could be intelligible (depending on family lifeworld), is socially appropriate, is factually true and is sincere.

However, some of that is cheating, because we have imported a particular set of background assumptions  X  the relation-ship between our entering room, doors being open, draughts, coldness, unpleasantness, and this being a motivator for a directive speech act. These are key to understanding that mother means  X  X  X lease shut the door X . From where do we obtain them? The LAP provides no guidance.

The DCP, however, could provide such guidance, via its aspectual model of the normativity of the cosmos. From various aspects, we could obtain the following: Physical aspect: Draughts come through openings.
 Biotic aspect: Heat loss can be detrimental.
 Psychic aspect: Feeling cold is unpleasant.
 Formative aspect: Entering room with door implies creating an opening. Determine to change the situation ... Lingual aspect: ... by speech act.
 Social aspect: It is appropriate for parent to give child directive. Also, employ pool of family idioms.
 Aesthetic aspect: Light-heartedness leading to use of idiom.
 And so on.
 In this way we see a progression of ability to understand the life-meaning from the text-meaning perspectives through
SAT to LAP and DCP. The issues that have been explained here include intentions, appropriateness and idioms. In the remain-ing examples, we will focus on other issues. The four text-meaning examples will not be mentioned because their limitations are largely as in this example.
 4.2. The library lending system
SAT directs us to ask what is the illocutionary intention of each library action. Johannesson [34] has analysed a library lending system according to illocutionary points: the request for a book is directive, the offer to loan the book (on the book becoming available) is commissive, the loan itself is also commissive because of an implied promise of return, and the re-minder that the book is (nearly) overdue is a directive. But this cannot direct us to ask whether reminders are appropriate to Japanese or gentlemanly cultures.

The LAP provides the basis for asking this question, with the validity claim of social appropriateness. As long as we know the lifeworld background assumptions of these two cultures, we can critique the validity of issuing reminders (and other library actions) and modify the system accordingly. Again, this presupposes an existing knowledge of lifeworld.
The DCP can take us a little further, by analysing it using Dooyeweerd X  X  aspects. The founding aspect is the lingual: pro-cessing of information. The qualifying aspect is the juridical ( X  X o each, their due X ), since borrowing (as opposed to giving or selling) implies return. This is law-side understanding which may be expected to apply across all cultures, whereas the need to issue reminders comes from our concrete (subject-side, culture-specific) experience of human functioning in another as-pect, the psychic, that people  X  X orget X  to return books. The latter is less fundamental and may be questioned if we wish to increase cultural flexibility. In cultures where people believe they are honour-bound (social aspect) to return what they have borrowed, reminders are less necessary.

It is impossible to specify all the conditions under which a rule holds. However, a useful design heuristic is that law-side understanding of the founding and qualifying aspects should indicate the core functioning of the IS (or model or ontology) and subject-side understanding, especially of other aspects, may be used to indicate additional functionality that makes the
IS work well in particular cultures. 4.3.  X  X  X ats, shoots &amp; leaves  X 
SAT directs us to seek to identify what the illocutionary intention of the title might be, regardless of its (locutionary) text-meaning. The illocutionary intention of any book title would seem, at first sight, to be assertive  X  to tell the reader what the book is about. But the title of a book is also a promise about what the book will deliver, hence there is some commissive intention here too. If we look at the panda X  X  use of the statement (on the back cover)  X  he first read it in the wildlife manual as asserting what pandas do  X  but then he used that as a norm to guide his action, which indicates a directive intention. Not only SAT has opened the way to a richer analysis than is possible from the text-meaning alone, but it also provides a basis on which we might differentiate the meaning of the utterance to different  X  X eople X  associated with it (panda and author). But none of this reveals that the book is about punctuation; in fact SAT has simply generated confusion. SAT on its own cannot help us resolve the fruitful confusion it has caused, and is powerless to help us understand the humour involved.
The LAP directs us to ask in what way  X  X  X ats, Shoots &amp; Leaves X  is part of social action. If we consider the statement as part of the panda X  X  explanation of why he discharged a firearm, the LAP can provide some insight which SAT cannot, such as that it is communicative social action and might be a conversation of accusation and defence (if such conversation types are recognised).
 If we consider the title as uttered by its author, the LAP finds a number of challenges. Whereas in most discussion of the
LAP, such as [25,64] , utterances are parts of on-going conversations, this title is not. (Lynne Truss might have discussed pos-piece intended to signify something general across a range of social activities. So, what type of social action or  X  X onversation X  is happening between author and those who read the title (in our case, researchers)? None of the types offered by Habermas or Winograd seem to fit well, though communicative action would almost fit. This distinction between texts that are part of an on-going conversation and those that are not primarily so, is invisible to SAT but challenges the LAP.

Secondly, the LAP directs us to critique the validity claims of the utterance. As uttered by the panda, it is quite intelligible, truthful and sincere, but socially inappropriate. As uttered by Lynne Truss, however, it is misleading rather than intelligible.
Habermasian theory would suggest this is a defect, but the unintelligibility is deliberate, as it is in many utterances with an aesthetic or humorous purpose. Critique of validity claims in this case is not particularly enlightening.

Thirdly, would knowledge of the lifeworld help? For example, readers and author share the understanding that discharg-ing a firearm in a restaurant is unusual, and hence might warn us to expect unusual interpretations. It would be almost impossible, however, to recognise why this title is for a book about punctuation, because to do so relies on going against our background shared understandings. It is the very essence of humour to do so. Unfortunately, the lifeworld element of the LAP, especially as it has been discussed by Habermas, provides very little basis for understanding such counter-lifeworld uses. It is possible that the notion of lifeworld can be extended to include this, but we are not aware of any such attempt.
Moreover, the humour lies not where we would ordinarily expect it, as a play on the text-meaning of the words, but in the presence of a piece of punctuation.

The DCP can take us further, because it approaches the issue from a different direction. Rather than focusing on the entity that is the speech act, conversation or social action, it focuses on the meaning and normativity that pervade the situation(s).
It recommends that we make aspectual analysis both of what the text signifies and also of the role the title plays in the life of people (author, readers, etc.), of the kind exemplified in Table 2 . Such an analysis might reveal that titles are supposed, as their life-meaning, to be informative (lingual aspect), suitable for the reader (social and juridical), succinct (economic), and pleasing (aesthetic); informative is, arguably, the most important and hence the qualifying aspect. The founding aspect is the aesthetic since the  X  X aterial X  of which the title is made is humour. While there is nothing in DCP to indicate that Lynne
Truss X  extraordinary type of humour is being employed, Dooyeweerd X  X  distinguishing of the aesthetic aspect from others, especially from the lingual and social, is helpful to us. It gives us a basis for expecting aesthetic surprise.
Moreover, because Dooyeweerd X  X  philosophy is not primarily about language, it can be more open to the idea that the humour might not be the usual play on text-meaning of words but can be found in the behaviour of its author, who gives an example of the topic rather than words that denote it or a play on words. Thus it is possible that DCP might at least point us in the right direction, not by giving us answers but by furnishing us with more questions to ask (arising from the aspects) than can the other perspectives. 4.4.  X  X  X he spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak  X 
This statement has at least three contexts, those of originator (Jesus and disciples), recorder (the gospel writers) and users (the early AI community and the authors of this article). The latter will be discussed below. The illocutionary intention of
Jesus, to which SAT directs us, would seem at first to be assertive, but when coupled with the entreaty that preceded it  X  X  X eep watch and pray that you will not fall into temptation X , then SAT might recognise a directive intention. But it does not provide us with any basis on which to reject the food-and-drink interpretation.

The LAP does provide us with a basis on which to reject the food-and-drink interpretation, because it directs us to critique the claim of the statement to validity as part of the social activity: speaking about quality of food and drink would be com-pletely inappropriate to the seriousness of the situation.

The LAP also directs us to analyse the part the utterance plays as part of social activity; in Habermas X  [26] terms, it is com-municative action, with some discursive. It is possible to see at least two conversations going on here, interleaved with each other, the main one with God, the other with the disciples. In the main conversation, which seems to be a conversation for gives them understanding of their situation and of why it was necessary for them to struggle to pray rather than fall asleep. It thus contributes some orientation.

What might not be fully accessible to this element of the LAP is the existential life-meaning: the tone of the statement as affirmatory challenge rather than annoyed condemnation. Critique of validity of the statement does not help, because both tones would satisfy all types of validity, including being socially and even morally appropriate. Reference to the lifeworld might reveal the existential life-meaning. Consider the following background knowledge: It is important to submit to God X  X  will, and sometimes it is a struggle to do so.

Given that God transcends us and is more meaningful than our personal trouble, a seriously religious person can, even in the midst of torment, maintain a clear understanding of generic spiritual realities such as this statement expresses.
A person who is undergoing extreme distress can expect their closest friends to support them, and might be disappointed when they do not.
 A good person can, even in their torment, think of others and try to affirm them even when they disappoint him.
From this, it seems reasonable to conclude that a tone of affirmatory challenge is more likely than one of condemnation. (How much more likely is not an issue here.)
The question is raised, however, would these background assumptions be reasonable to those living in the Jewish culture of 2000 years ago in a Roman-controlled province? Unfortunately, the LAP has developed within a research culture that emphasises differences rather than commonalities between cultures, and consequently has little basis on which to distin-guish background understanding that might be culturally dependent from that which might be trans-cultural. pre-theoretical experience tells us that some trans-cultural understanding is possible, at least of such basic aspects of human assumptions could prove very useful in DKE/NLP research.

Perhaps the Dooyeweerdian notion of law-side shared background could come to our rescue here. If Dooyeweerd was cor-rect that we grasp the kernel meaning of aspects with a type of law-side intuition that is deeper than our historical or the-oretical processes, then certain types of understanding are indeed shared with all cultures across all time and geography. The four background assumptions above arguably exhibit this even if not perfectly, the first two emerging from the faith aspect, the third from the social and the fourth from the ethical aspect of self-giving. This becomes clearer if we contrast them with subject-side background that we might expect to have been shared by Jesus and his disciples at the time, for example about
Roman rule in Palestine, about Jewish religious laws and practices, about precise formulae for prayer. If this is so, then we have a basis for cautiously relying on the possibility of some trans-cultural understanding.

More penetrating aspectual analysis of the situation can support this by asking, which is the most important life-meaning aspect in making the utterance? Taking our statement with [U7], why did Jesus utter [U7,U8]? Is it social as in [U1-3], to obtain Peter X  X  support for himself? If it had been, we might have expected him to say  X  X  X atch and pray, to ask God that I will not fail. X  Another possibility, centred on the faith aspect, one that has been assumed by large portions of the Christian church, is that Jesus was primarily making two theological statements of universal utility, that we should pray, and that our good intentions are often thwarted by our own weakness. Neither seem to be the thrust of the statements in their ori-ginal situation. Rather, from the wording, Jesus seems to have been wanting to help Peter rather than himself, despite his own anguish; this is the ethical aspect of self-giving coupled with a challenge to Peter to fulfil his potential (faith aspect). This makes it the more likely that the existential meaning of the statement is affirmatory challenge.

Intuitive grasp of aspectual meaning is good at understanding everyday living, and exposing the important issues therein, which are frequently overlooked in discussions of professional or business contexts. Here we have demonstrated how it may be used, first to extract those background understandings which transcend cultures, second to make more penetrating aspec-tual analyses of actual statements. The latter, the reader will have noticed, relied on intuitive rather than strictly theoretical reasoning. 4.5. Flaws in NLP
This subsection considers the use of  X  X  X he spirit is willing but the flesh is weak X  by the early AI community and the current authors. It is used as X within the utterance,  X  X  X  was translated as Y X , where Y is  X  X  X he drinks are good but the meat is poor. X  This analysis will be much briefer.

SAT directs us to consider the illocutionary intention.  X  X  X  was translated as Y X  does indeed seem assertive, but SAT com-pletely misses the use of humour. It would be helped by having an illocutionary type of  X  X umorous X .

Humour depends on the lifeworld to make it work as humour. As mentioned above, in Western culture it is taken to refer to a notion that our good intentions are often thwarted by our weaknesses, which, again by the lifeworld, is seen to be a of these yields humour. Both the LAP and DCP can probably get us that far, using the avenues outlined above.
But on what basis would this humour draw our attention to the proposition that machine translation exhibits flaws? The analysis would have to indicate absurdity. This might be accomplished in DCP because Dooyeweerd argued that if we con-flate two irreducibly distinct types of aspectual rationality, we end up with antinomy. Briefly, in  X  X  X  is translated as Y X , X ex-presses something of the faith aspect while Y expresses something aesthetic (relating to the quality of food and drink at a party). So we have such a conflation, which might warn us that absurdity is intended. 4.6. Synthesis of results
So far we have seen that the three perspectives, SAT, the LAP and DCP can help us to ask questions whose answering re-veals the life-meaning in the examples. Table 3 summarises what the life-meaning analyses above revealed about the var-ious utterances. It states their social situation, the types of illocutionary intention as categorised by Searle [46] , types of social action as introduced by Habermas [26] , types of conversation as proposed by Winograd [64] and qualifying and found-ing aspects (cf. Section 3.7.1 ) as delineated by Dooyeweerd [17] . Explanations, where not already indicated above, are given in brackets; question marks indicate our degree of uncertainty or ambiguity about the categorization.

It is worthwhile noticing the preponderance of communicative action types. This might be expected since we are dealing with text; it is also in line with Habermas X  claim that CA is the most basic in human affairs. However, it also suggests that the
Habermasian action types might not be particularly useful to discriminate between types of life-meaning; in the earlier dis-cussion validity claims of Universal Pragmatics seemed more useful. Likewise, illocutionary types do not seem to discrimi-nate very usefully.

On the other hand, there seems to be a useful correlation between the founding aspect and whether the life-meaning sub-verts or merely adds to the text-meaning (aesthetic founding subverts it, lingual does not). The qualifying aspect seems al-most as varied as the life-meanings we discovered. These issues deserve further research.

In sketching out how each perspective might help us analyse the life-meaning in the examples we have been able to re-veal at least something of the following life-meaning issues: extra-linguistic intentions, idioms, humour, culturally depen-dent assumptions, trans-cultural assumptions and existential life-meaning. What this exercise suggests is that, taking Table 1 into account, SAT and the LAP and DCP together have some potential to assist in a number of DKE/NLP tasks. In the follow-ing section a number of practical suggestions are made as to how this potential might be realized. 5. Some initial proposals
It will be helpful to keep Table 3 in mind throughout this section, which outlines a number of practical suggestions that can illustrate how something of life-meaning could be incorporated into DKE/NLP research to enhance its power. These illus-trations will be mere outlines of salient points concerning text understanding, leaving much detail to be filled in, especially how these ideas can be migrated to specific tasks like summarization or ontology construction. Emphasis will be placed on research that can begin immediately, but in a way that provides long-term direction.
The first suggestion is a relatively simple one inspired by SAT, which has already been recognised and could perhaps be capitalised upon immediately, though it will open up new avenues for research. Then a number of suggestions are made which are inspired by the LAP. These increase in complexity, and substantial research might be needed to realize some of them. In the second subsection, contributions by DCP are discussed, first a reasonably simple one which enriches SAT and the LAP, followed by brief outlines of a number of more substantial suggestions. A final subsection reviews the contributions of each perspective in the light of the others. 5.1. Employing SAT and the LAP in DKE/NLP
There are two main ways to employ SAT in DKE/NLP research. One is to analyse illocutionary life-meaning of utterances, whether in human sources or computer-stored text. A number of examples of such analysis have already been presented in
Section 4 , but how to meet the challenge that illocutionary intention is not easily derivable from text-meaning requires research.

The other way to employ SAT is to record the illocutionary intention of every utterance explicitly when it is stored. This might help meet the above challenge, but contains other benefits of its own. It was mentioned earlier that there has been some recognition of life-meaning in DKE/NLP, especially in the LIKE project [57] . Johannesson [34] extends Sowa X  X  Concep-tual Graphs to include illocutionary intention. Dik [16] includes illocutionary intention in the message level of Functional Grammar. While these proposals might form a basis for what follows, they will need extension.

Every act of data entry, every utterance in a text, every relationship in a model and every predicate in an ontology might be seen as a speech act with life-meaning as well as text-meaning. Thus, as already discussed, every record of a library bor-rowing exhibits commissive as well as assertive intention. So a simple first step towards implementing life-meaning might be to add fields to each record in a database, text unit in a textbase, relationship in a model and predicate in an ontology that indicate illocutionary intention(s). Searle X  X  taxonomy of intentions  X  assertive, directive, expressive, commissive and declar-ative  X  could be used, though, as indicated earlier, it might prove somewhat restrictive. application or task in DKE/NLP might benefit from these.

This will open up new research issues, for example concerning the ability of everyone who makes utterances to know their illocutionary intention, willingness to reveal those that are covert, the interaction between illocutionary intentions of recorder and originator where these are different, and how best to handle all these.

More sophisticated analysis and storage of life-meaning, however, calls for elements of the LAP. Straightforwardly, fields indicating LAP elements could be added alongside those for illocutionary intention, using available taxonomies of their types, such as social action types [26] : instrumental, strategic, normatively regulated, dramaturgical, communicative, (discursive); conversation types [64] : for action, clarification, possibilities, orientation; types of social rationality [26] : mainly instrumental versus communicative; validity claims [26] : intelligibility (if not implied), sincerity, propositional truth and social/moral appropriateness.
The benefits of this taxonomical information are likely to be an enhancement of those in Table 4 . As indicated in Section 4 , however, it is likely that these taxonomies will prove too limited for DKE/NLP research and a proposal for extending them is made later. Merely adding LAP-oriented fields does not realize the full potential of the LAP, which lies in the recognition that utterances gain most of their life-meaning within the context of social activity. This presents further, and more exciting, research challenges for DKE/NLP.

If records, text units, relationships and predicates are utterances, then their social action might be the whole database, text (e.g. web page), model or ontology, or else these might comprise multiple social actions. However, the relationship between of social action or conversation to utterances as suggested above. Rather, they form complex, interleaved networks, as seen in the Gethsemane example. Analysis of such texts as blogs would benefit from recognising this. As  X  X  X he spirit is willing ...  X  also shows, an utterance might be used in many different conversations, and validity claims apply in different ways in each.
This aspect of the LAP has been used to model business processes and organisational conversations, including [13,15,51,60,64] . The richness that the LAP can impart is demonstrated by Goldkuhl X  X  [25] treatment of the relationship be-tween customer and supplier. The LAP recognises much more than request and delivery ( X  X ould you please do X? X ,  X  X  X es, I X  X l do X X ,  X  X  X  X  X e done X X ,  X  X  X K, Thank you X ); a complex, on-going series of intermediate exchanges becomes manifest, consisting of proposals, commitments, fulfilments and assessments. As both [25] and [55] show, such conversations can take place within each other at several levels. Steuten et al. [51] presented a formal way to model business communications as  X  X ommunicative acts X , their idea being inspired indirectly by Habermas X  TCA. Illocutionary intention is important, but mainly in order to mod-el mutual obligation. It is not clear, however, that any of these approaches are sophisticated enough to handle the kinds of life-meaning discussed in the first, third and fourth examples, because they have mainly been applied to simplified, struc-tured and well-understood processes like booking a hotel room.
Winograd X  X  [64] early attempt went further in two ways. He applied the LAP to less structured conversations, such as of nurses discussing a patient X  X  treatment, and used these ideas as a design rationale for actual prototype software, in The Coor-dinator . Its main design goal was to support the management of commitments. It facilitated conversations by embodying the normative requirements of each type of conversation. For example, conversations for action and possibilities tend to be started differently, and in the former one can expect things like promises, counter-offers, declinations, cancel promises, etc. so the system provided for such events. The reasons why The Coordinator does not seem to have made much impact on system design are worthwhile following up, given the recent advances in semantic information processing, and could give hints which directions are most fruitful for incorporating life-meaning features into the next generation of DKE/NLP proto-type software.

More challenging still, and likely to require a long-term research program in DKE/NLP, is the third element of the LAP, the background lifeworld assumptions that give the text (or model or database or ontology) its meaning  X  different meaning to the originator, recorder and users. If, as argued earlier, users of a text must take into account possible differences in back-ground between themselves and originators and recorders in order to avoid misunderstandings, then it would be useful if (a) backgrounds of originator and recorder are stored alongside the text and (b) users are made aware of the ways in which these differed from their own. As a first step one might simply add fields to texts denoting pre-selected types of background assumptions, and then ask each user to select their own from a list of these types, so as to warn them of any differences between their culture and that of the originator or recorder, or any salient implications thereof. In the library example, the system itself could encode such differences in the case of Japanese users  X  but this does presuppose that system design-ers already know all the relevant implications of cultural differences. Philosophical hermeneutics [23] can provide concepts for exploring these differences of background assumptions between originator, recorder and users, on which NLP research could draw.

Such knowledge might not always be present, and most backgrounds are much more complex than can be pre-classified in such ways. They call instead for complete semantic nets to represent each background, the immense complexity of which is exacerbated by its tacit, background nature. A method for making tacit knowledge explicit is mentioned below. However, the very act of making the background explicit gives rise to a third difficulty: it can inhibit the originator X  X  free expression and the user X  X  full engagement with the text, thus distorting the transference of meaning from one to the other. Thus, if these proposals are deemed interesting, it will require considerable research, and our suggestion below, to capitalize on Dooyew-eerd X  X  spheres of meaning, might help.

An even more challenging research proposal involves existing texts (or models). For these, no such life-meaning fields exist, and the illocutionary intentions, social action, validity and background assumptions have to be inferred. Some of the research surrounding the so-called Pragmatic Web [44] might contribute to this. This could be particularly useful for anal-ysing blogs and other material in which texts arise from their originators X  immediate, spontaneous response rather than from deliberation. Well-written texts often contain some indications of these elements of life-meaning, examples including the introductory sections of academic works, and references to other material (such as hyperlinks in good web pages). Such indi-cations might be analyzable by text-meaning methods. How these elements of life-meaning can be inferred from texts that are not so well designed requires research.

As mentioned earlier, the LAP assumes rational social action, but a considerable amount of text cannot usefully be seen in such terms. Either the LAP could be redefined to include other types of social action to better contribute to NLP research and practice in this context, or this limitation might be overcome by incorporating insights from the third life-meaning perspec-tive, DCP. 5.2. Employing DCP in DKE/NLP
As explained later, whereas SAT might be seen as part of the LAP, DCPstands in a different relationship to the other per-spectives and consequently could make different kinds of contribution. Its first and simplest contribution is to enrich SAT and the LAP by using Dooyeweerd X  X  suite of aspects to extend their taxonomies. Because aspects allow us to define distinct types of meaning, occurrence, rationality, etc. (see Section 3.7.1 ), Searle X  X  types of illocutionary intention, Winograd X  X  types of conversation and Habermas X  types of social action, rationality andvalidity claim can be aligned with aspects, as depicted in Table 5 . (We leave out the first few aspects because they are seldom of primary importance in social action.)
In each column, several aspects are empty. This suggests that none of these classifications are completely exhaustive, and this might explain the occasional difficulty the analysis in Section 4 encountered. It may be possible to expand each classi-fication by reference to the empty aspects. For example, introducing an aesthetic illocutionary intention might allow SAT to discover the humour in  X  X  X  is translated as Y X  (cf. Section 4.5 ). However, expanding a classification should be done with due regard to the motivations by which, and the foundational assumptions upon which, each was originally developed; such dis-cussions must be left to another occasion.
 Expanding classifications, however, does not do justice to the full potential of DCP.

There is a tendency in the LAP and SAT to assume, as an ideal, a single type of illocution or social action. On this assump-tion we tried to build Table 3 : a single type or single aspect for each utterance. For many this could not be done. The assump-tion of a single aspect might be useful for those learning how to use Dooyeweerd, but it is something of a distortion of
Dooyeweerd X  X  emphasis, which is that all things exhibit all aspects, even when qualified by one. Even in the ideal, we should treat the life-meaning of each utterance or text as multi-aspectual.

The overall contribution is that DCP does not assume that social action need be primarily rational or language-based (though it allows for both), and it captures very well the diversity of everyday life, i.e. the meaning and normativity that is the lifeworld. This makes it admirably suited to the DKE tasks of creating models, intelligent agents and virtual realities outside the professional or technical arena, in such applications as social networking and virtual worlds. Multi-aspectual rationality can be usefully encoded in such systems to provide them with believable and nuanced behaviours.
Winfield [62,63] has developed the MAKE method (Multi-Aspectual Knowledge Elicitation) in knowledge engineering to capture rich ontologies of expertise. It is used in conversations with domain experts to stimulate their consideration of every aspect of their expertise. It has proven effective in opening up the background understandings that are often overlooked be-cause what Jacob and Ebrahimpur [33, p. 78] call  X  X uter parameters X  are often simply of aspects that are taken for granted.
Among NLP tasks, further possibilities exist. In attempting to create an ontology for individual topics like cancer by accessing the huge corpus that is the Web, S X nchez and Moreno [54] find that focusing on verbs can be more effective than other methods. To Dooyeweerd, this is not surprising since verbs and qualifiers, much more than nouns, express the meaning related to single aspects, and hence focusing on them can penetrate more quickly to core aspectual meaning. Maybe an awareness of the distinct spheres of meaning could augment S X nchez and Moreno X  X  statistical methods. In similar vein, lex-icons like WordNet [38] could benefit from incorporating the main aspect(s) that make each word meaningful. This could assist in text understanding tasks (including correction and summarization) by allowing closer examination and critique of the rationality of texts, on the grounds that any attempt to argue from the rationality of one aspect to that of another is a non-sequitur. This might also provide useful grounds for checking the rationality of models and ontologies and detecting the kind of absurdity that might indicate the presence of humour.

In the Gethsemane example (Section 4.4 ) the utility of the notion of trans-cultural, law-side background was demon-strated in being able to reveal existential life-meaning, and such an approach might prove useful when building models of situations. However, the main value for DKE/NLP research of the notion of trans-cultural, law-side background is at a stra-tegic level. It establishes hope that we can understand at least something of other cultures whose texts we are analysing, and hence research based on this assumption can be worthwhile. It makes the analysis of assumptions behind texts more trac-table. This suggests a more systematic way to build flexibility into our software. In the library system, for example, the no-tion that borrowing (as opposed to giving or selling) implies return is a direct consequence of the kernel meaning of the juridical aspect, which is  X  X o each, their due X . By contrast, the need to issue reminders comes from our concrete (subject-side, culture-specific) experience that people  X  X orget X  to return books. The latter is, therefore, less fundamental and may be ques-tioned if we wish to increase cultural flexibility. In cultures where people believe they are honour-bound to return what they have borrowed, reminders are less necessary. 5.3. Relationships between, and contribution of, the perspectives
SAT, Habermas X  TCA and the LAP may be seen as a sequence in which the notion of life-meaning was progressively opened up. Prior to SAT, text was treated as an entity that is able to convey meaning independently of the intentions of its human originators. SAT made a paradigmatic correction to this by drawing attention to illocutionary intention. In so doing, SAT took note of one of the key insights of Husserl X  X  phenomenology, namely that meanings originate in the layers of consciousness. Habermas X  TCA built on SAT to make a further fundamental shift, by modifying the social action aspect of language use. The LAP then applied TCA practically in the context of information systems development and use. Since both TCA and the LAP call upon SAT, SAT should be seen as a component of them. Though one might argue that SAT is thereby subsumed under the
LAP, and thus need not be considered separately, we have found it useful to do so since SAT indicates a practical first step into research oriented to life-meaning, a step which has already been partly taken in Dik X  X  [16] aforementioned FG and Johannes-son X  X  [34] ECG. The LAP, though, offers the basis on which to tackle more issues. Specifically, it encourages researchers to consider all text as social activity or as part of an ongoing conversation, to pay attention to validity claims, and to recognise the essential part played by shared background knowledge. In this respect, the LAP seems better suited to addressing issues related to the potential complexities of everyday use of text.

The relationship of DCP with SAT and the LAP is different. DCP is not within the mainstream of research in linguistics nor in NLP, partly because it is not a theory of language as such, and partly because the philosophy from which it derives has not emerged from any Western mainstream philosophy lying at the root of most language perspectives. Though it can make a contribution of its own, it should not be assumed to replace SAT and the LAP in a series of progressive openings up, but rather to enrich them. It achieves this by exposing issues that SAT and the LAP do not adequately address, at least not in their cur-rent state of development.

Firstly, DCP articulates matters that are implied in the LAP, and gives a handle on the diversity with which the LAP in prin-ciple has to deal. We have suggested that DCP can extend the diversity that is visible to SAT, as types of speech act, and to the
LAP, as types of social action, conversation and validity claims. It does so because it offers systematic-philosophical, and not merely pragmatic, grounds for addressing and recognising diversity, which are found in Dooyeweerd X  X  theory of modal spheres (aspects). Dooyeweerd discussed at length and in depth the relationships between the aspects and the conditions under which we might validly distinguish them analytically. As a result, DCP is able also to enrich attempts to deal with other issues of importance to DKE and NLP; for example the three types of environment, organizational, legal and ethical, identified in [21] might be expanded with Dooyeweerd to include also the biotic, sensitive, lingual, aesthetic and faith envi-ronments. In enriching extant categorizations, Dooyeweerd X  X  suite of aspects can serve as a checklist with which to ask,  X  X  X as any aspect been overlooked? X . Basden [5] discusses the validity of doing this.

Secondly, Dooyeweerd articulates more explicitly than the LAP does the nature of the lifeworld (shared background understandings). Unlike Habermas X  [27] approach, Dooyeweerd X  X  allows us to understand the structure and diversity of the lifeworld, as engagement with all aspects (law side) and all that the aspects enable (subject side). His suite of aspects can thus be a useful tool with which to approach the lifeworld in practice, not to analyse it theoretically but to identify what types of meaning and normativity we might expect to discern therein. This opens the way to understanding cultural life-and-world-views, which lie behind many texts and also underneath IS design.

The Dooyeweerdian differentiation of trans-cultural law-side intuition from culture-dependent subject-side intuition can inform strategies for text understanding and model-building, by leading us to separate out the presence of each and treat each differently.ItcanalsoassistinISdesignstrategy,indirectingustowardsdesignrequirementsthatcallforbuildinginflexibility.
Finally, in contrast to the LAP, which elevates the lingual aspect (with the exception of strategic and instrumental ac-tions), Dooyeweerd allows of social activity in which language is not paramount, even though it might be present. TCA X  X   X  X in-guistification X  of the lifeworld accounts for the importance of lingual functioning to social action, but has a tendency to see only the lingual aspect  X  and an analytical version of it at that. This is why most discussion of the LAP involves business applications or those that require critique of validity claims. Dooyeweerd enables us to recognise social activity in which the lingual aspect is far from most important, and where insertion of critique of validity claims would be inappropriate.
Examples include intervening passionately in situations when we perceive injustice, communal worship, love-making. With his multiple aspects being each of equal intrinsic value, Dooyeweerd provides an alternative basis for understanding extra-lingual social action which the LAP cannot give us. This does not invalidate the LAP, but places it in a wider context of human living, and challenges it to be able to handle extra-linguistic social action without seeking to reduce it to the lingual. If the
Web  X  X  X pproximates the real distribution of the information in humankind X  [54, p. 601] then something like Dooyeweerd X  X  wider view will be necessary whenever it is searched semantically.

However, there is at least one challenge in using Dooyeweerd X  X  approach: it can be too comprehensive, and, if we are not careful, can rob us of any sense of direction among the multiple aspectual dimensions of reality. In its focus on the lingual aspect, the LAP (TCA) provides the direction needed to make DCP as fruitful as it could be. So, rather than DKE and NLP work-ing with a single perspective, we would see the ideal to be the three being used together. 6. Discussions and conclusion
The main purpose of this article was to explain for a broad audience why some research in NLP and DKE could make sub-stantial progress if it were to incorporate the life-meaning of texts more extensively in its methods than is currently the case.
In order to support this conjecture, we examined in some detail how DKE/NLP could build on the tradition of language research that has focused on the pivotal role of life-meaning in natural language communications  X  from Frege X  X  provocative distinction between sense and reference, via Searle X  X  Speech Act Theory, to Habermas X  Theory of Communicative Action.
The Language Action Perspective can be interpreted as a synthesis of these ground-breaking conceptual advances. In addi-tion, we added a new proposal, namely that the LAP in turn could be made more powerful by incorporating some key prin-ciples of Dooyeweerd X  X  philosophy, especially his notions of aspects and types of intuition. This constitutes what we have called a life-meaning approach to DKE/NLP. We also formulated some tentative proposals to illustrate how DKE/NLP research could benefit from paying more attention to life-meaning in future research. These, together with the analyses in Section 4 , should be treated more as vignettes to stimulate consideration of possibilities, than as firm proposals.

We are aware that it will take a major cooperative effort to develop the life-meaning approach in sufficient detail so that its potential can be realized. Expending such an effort would depend on redirecting some existing research resources and investing new ones, which in turn raises broader issues that cannot be ignored. First of these is the question of whether warrant the expenditure of significant resources. We do not wish to repeat the na X   X  ve enthusiasm of the promises of early artificial intelligence research. An awareness of the limits of any new approach intended for widespread use is also of impor-tance for safeguarding against its potential misapplication, often propagated by an uncritical press and then causing costly errors without proper user education. Therefore the second issue is whether anything can be said about the likely limits of the life-meaning approach. The third issue is who needs to be involved in future research.

In response to the first question, whether a broad audience exists as potential users of software incorporating life-mean-ing based NLP principles, we may point to existing prototypes of the so-called Semantic Web. They have been under devel-opment at least since 2001 and their first prototype applications are now appearing on the horizon. If the vision of the future roles of the Semantic Web depicted below [20] is correct, then the widespread need for more powerful NLP and DKE methods appears to be assured. Some observers believe that the current stage of Semantic Web applications should be compared to early browser prototypes as they appeared in the early 1990s. If the argument presented in this article is correct, at least in its principal thrust, the promises like those outlined in the following for the Semantic Web can only be met if NLP adopts methods that do not remain limited to text-meaning.
 The Semantic Web in Action [20] Six years ago in this magazine, Tim Berners-Lee, James Hendler and Ora Lassila unveiled a nascent vision of the Semantic
Web: a highly interconnected network of data that could be easily accessed and understood by any desktop or handheld machine. They painted a future of intelligent software agents that would head out on the World Wide Web and automat-ically book flights and hotels for our trips, update our medical records and give us a single, customized answer to a par-ticular question without our having to search for information or pore through results.

They also presented the young technologies that would make this vision come true: a common language for representing data that could be understood by all kinds of software agents; ontologies X  X ets of statements X  X hat translate information from disparate databases into common terms; and rules that allow software agents to reason about the information described in those terms. The data format, ontologies and reasoning software would operate like one big application on the World Wide Web, analyzing all the raw data stored in online databases as well as all the data about the text, images, video and communications the Web contained. Like the Web itself, the Semantic Web would grow in a grassroots fashion, onlythistimeaidedbyworkinggroupswithintheWorldWideWebConsortium,whichhelpstoadvancetheglobalmedium.

This brings us to the second issue: limits. Good reasons speak against the expectation that fully automated NLP could (or even should) be able to equal the capabilities of human linguistic competence. Chomsky concluded that we are unlikely to be able to design a complete set of rules to capture the human capabilities in natural language processing. As we saw, Winograd a similar argument on metaphysical grounds, but his reasons rest on presuppositions about how one should compare com-puter with human language processing with which not all would agree; chapter 5 of [5] discusses this issue further. Sounder philosophical support may be found in Wittgenstein X  X  and Heidegger X  X  observations, that language meaning is rooted in par-ticipating in human ways of life, and in Dooyeweerd X  X  contention that only human beings can function as subjects in the lingual and post-lingual aspects.

What this means is that the human user needs to be involved intimately in the processing of text. Our four examples show this.  X  X  X ere you born in a tunnel? X  is only understandable once one knows the life-meaning of communities that em-ploy this idiom. The library system revealed the importance of cultural background. In the case of Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves , hu-man involvement is required to perceive what the panda is doing in the picture and appreciate the unusual type of provocation employed in order to showcase the importance of correct punctuation. In the case of  X  X  X he spirit is willing ...  X , several lifeworlds must be captured and taken into account, which is an extremely challenging semantic task, but one which human beings can do easily (provided they have some background in the New Testament). Only existential  X  X eing-in-the-world X  and  X  X eing-with-others X  can acquire the meanings of language use and keep them updated. Despite this limitation, however, it is likely that better rule sets can be compiled than currently exist at least to detect (and hence to select or model) the life-meaning issues discussed here.

However, what will it take to make this happen? This takes us to the third issue. Currently, the theoretical knowledge and technological skills required for implementing the proposed directions of DKE and NLP research are distributed among at least six research communities. Beside the NLP and DKE communities themselves these are the IS specialization in theory and methods of information systems development, philosophy of language, artificial intelligence, especially expert systems, and human X  X omputer interaction. These specializations form so-called communities of practice that exist within the insti-tutional structures of at least three major disciplines, namely, IS (also called MIS) organized in AIS (the Association of Infor-mation Systems), Linguistics and Computer Science organized in the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery). Not all specializations need to be represented in every NLP or DKE research project, but in general, one can expect that life-mean-ing-oriented research must face the challenges of interacting communities of practice (CoP).

Hirschheim and Klein [29] and Klein and Hirschheim [35] have presented detailed analyses of why communication and cooperation between differing CoPs tend to be fraught with great difficulties even if these live within the same disciplinary institution. 13 They emphasise the role of shared background understandings within each CoP and recommend boundary span-
Not only is boundary spanning important to the successful progress in life-meaning research, but the insights about cultural understandings generated by life-meaning research might themselves feed back to facilitate boundary spanning, since, increas-ingly, Web searching is employed in such boundary spanning. Nevertheless, the matching of the researcher X  X  expertise profiles to the research objectives needs careful attention for achieving trustworthy results of projects probing the potential and limits of integrating life-meaning approaches into NLP and DKE prototypes.

This article has opened a door onto new vistas. Perhaps, in terms of the life-meaning with which it began, we can say that we were not born in tunnels, but in open air where there are many directions we can take. The challenges all around us are substantial, but exciting. Therefore, we are optimistic that DKE/NLP research oriented to life-meaning might be both possible and beneficial.
