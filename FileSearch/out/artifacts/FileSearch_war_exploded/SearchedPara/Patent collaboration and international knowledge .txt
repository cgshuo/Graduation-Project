 1. Introduction
Technological innovations have become more and more important for a country X  X  economic growth and competitiveness in the period of global knowledge economy. As one important kind of knowledge outputs, technological innovations heavily depend on various knowledge inputs. The inside R&amp;D expenditure and personnel investment are indeed important, but they are far from all, especially for small firms, developing regions, and countries that have relative few R&amp;D investment. Though the R&amp;D input is highly concentrated in a relatively small number of advanced countries, as OECD countries account for 83% of the world X  X  R&amp;D expenditure ( OECD, 2004 ), there are many countries taking part in technological innovation activities.
Besides the direct R&amp;D investment, innovation and technical progress rest on interactions among actors producing, distrib-is risky, cost-consuming and time-consuming. While knowledge and technology imports from elsewhere offer immediate access to desirable technologies and come to be a major source of technological progress for developing countries and newly industrialized economies ( Kuo &amp; Yang, 2008 ). For lower-developed countries and regions, it takes a long time to reach the technology frontier of innovation-driven economies. Before this, they can reduce the technology gap and catch-up by  X  absorbing external knowledge from technologically leading nations through various knowledge interactions ( Guan, Mok, &amp;
Yam, 2006 ). The generation of knowledge often requires substantial investment in R&amp;D, but the repeated application of this knowledge, once produced, entails only little incremental cost ( Arrow, 1962 ).

The role of knowledge flow has been emphasized both in theoretical arguments and empirical studies ( Cowan &amp; Jonard, 2004; Schilling &amp; Phelps, 2007 ). There are many types of knowledge, simple and complex, coded and tacit, know-what and know-how, and they can be diffused through various channels according to the nature of the knowledge at hand ( Evans, direct investment, in recent academic literature, there is increasing consensus that an innovator X  X  embeddedness in a network of inter-innovator relationships matters for its economic and innovation performance. It is believed that social networks, both informal friendship and formal collaboration networks, contribute to innovation by their ability of informa-tion, knowledge and technology diffusion ( Hertzum, 2008; Yin, Kretschmer, Hannerman, &amp; Liu, 2006 ). There are several stud-ies providing evidence that research collaboration can efficiently enhance scientists X  productivity ( Lee &amp; Bozeman, 2005; technology competiveness ( Fleming, King, &amp; Juda, 2007; Saxenian, 1994, chap. 2 ), and industries X  knowledge creation ( Lim &amp; Park, 2009 ). Other studies focused on how social network structure influenced the flow of knowledge and how the 2004; Schilling &amp; Phelps, 2007; Uzzi &amp; Spiro, 2005 ).

Patent data have been treated as the most important output indicator of innovation for their standardized information relating to new ideas and technological development ( Frietsch &amp; Grupp, 2006 ). Patent data from US Patent and Trademarks
Office (USPTO) are commonly used in empirical studies to measure innovation performance and knowledge flows for its high quality and good availability. Information contained in USPTO is easily accessible, catalogued in the same times, and stored for a long period of times, and therefore their analysis has become the focus of many tools and techniques to measure inno-patent collaboration on the future information flow by demonstrating that a large fraction of the geographical citation spill-over results from collaboration networks. An interview of some USPTO inventors also reported that most interviewees kept some degree of technical interaction after a patent collaboration and even when they no longer worked at the same firm ( Fleming et al., 2007 ). Chen and Guan (2010) have used USPTO co-patent data to find that the best knowledge flow efficiency accompanies with a moderate clustering coefficient and small world quotient.

Although research has considered collaboration networks to be crucial carriers for knowledge diffusion, the current stud-ies mainly concentrate on personal, institutional, discipline, industrial, or regional level. We still know little about the col-laboration networks at national level. Though there were some studies carried on national level, they focused on just one or a relatively small number of countries. This has motivated the current study to investigate the collaboration network involving most countries for a relative long time span. This study aims to investigate the characters and evolutions of international knowledge flow through patent collaboration network in 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Co-patent data from USPTO are used to construct a rich longitudinal database of cross-national collaborations among all countries recorded by USPTO during 1981 X 1985, 1991 X 1995, and 2001 X 2005. We use these certain periods instead of whole years for that 2005 is the latest year available for complete patent data, and as samples, 5-year periods are reliable to reflect evolution characters and changes of decades.

Economic models often describe a worldwide technology frontier, which is created by the main innovative countries and then travels quickly to all countries. There is an international stock of knowledge, from which every economy can draw to facilitate its own technological innovation. The OECD economies create most of this stock, whereas the developing econo-mies are available to the knowledge pool by channels of knowledge diffusion ( Hu &amp; Jaffe, 2003 ). As the knowledge flows be-tween OECD group and non-OECD group are especially important for the technology globalization and latecomers X  catch-up, it is necessary to look into this kind of global knowledge flows. Therefore, in this study, we classify the economies into two groups, OECD and non-OECD group, in order to identify characteristics of knowledge diffusion within groups and between groups, separately. To capture the evolution of knowledge diffusion pattern, our study compares networks of three periods, which are 1981 X 1985, 1991 X 1995, and 2001 X 2005, respectively. Using the patent collaboration data, we try to answer the following questions: How does this kind of knowledge interaction distribute among the country-pairs in the sample studied?
To which extent the knowledge flows happen between OECD group and non-OECD one? Which countries play as the main bridges for overall knowledge flows and which countries play as the main bridges for the knowledge flows between the groups?
This study extends the existing literature in several ways. First, we draw from a broad sample of patent collaborations at
USPTO patent for a wide time span. Second, when we analyze the international knowledge flows accompanying with patent collaborations, the countries are divided into two groups, i.e., the main knowledge creators and the main knowledge users, in order to measure characteristics of knowledge flows within groups and between groups separately. And specially, we use the newly developed network indicator, Q-measures in valued networks ( Rousseau &amp; Zhang, 2008 ), for numeric estimation of each country X  X  bridge effect for between-group knowledge flows. Finally, in order to investigate the evolvement of interna-tional knowledge interaction patterns, we compare the knowledge networks of international patent collaboration from 1980s to 2000s by building three 5-year networks.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data of patent inventors and how the networks are generated, and network indicators used in this paper. Then, we present our empirical results and explore the roles each country playing in the networks and the evolution of the international knowledge flow patterns in Section 3 . Finally, con-clusions are provided in Section 4 . 2. The data and method 2.1. Data
The data set used in this study consists of all utility patents granted by the USPTO during 1981 X 1985, 1991 X 1995, and 2001 X 2005. 2 The data elements that we utilize are (1) the patent number; (2) the patent grant year, which can be obtained by patent number; and (3) the resident country of each inventor. Cross-border patent collaborations serve an important channel for international knowledge diffusion, as knowledge, technology, and skills flow from one country to the other one along with an extended time period and often maintain close interpersonal contact even years after patent filing ( Singh, 2005 ). We assume that the frequency of a given country X  X  inventors collaborating with their counterparts in another country is a proxy for the intensity of knowledge flow between the two countries. If a patent was co-patented by multiple inventors and these inventors from 1981 to 1985 are scanned in order to count the number of collaborations for each country pair. Then, we build the directed valued collaboration network for period 1981 X 1985, in which countries are denoted by nodes, and number of collaborations are represented by edge weights. Following the same way, the other two collaboration networks are constructed for 1991 X 1995 and 2001 X 2005, respectively. 2.2. Network analysis
After generation of networks, we use network analysis to obtain more insight into the patterns of the international knowl-edge diffusion. Network analysis is a recently developed method for social structure study and has been already used in innovation studies ( Chang &amp; Shih, 2005; Fleming et al., 2007; Guan &amp; Chen, 2009; Leoncini, Maggioni, &amp; Montresor, 1996 ). In this study, the innovation countries, their knowledge flow interactions, and the corresponding intensities are indi-cated by nodes, edges, and edge weights, separately. The structure and position of countries in the network provide rich information on diverse aspects of an individual country, a group of countries (i.e., OECDs and non-OECDs), and the whole network. Various network indicators are helpful for finding and understanding these aspects of a network. Among those measures, three of them have been conducted in this paper. First, degree centrality is used to measure the power and influ-ence of each country. Second, flow betweenness is utilized to gauge the extent to which each country facilitates the knowl-edge flow in the overall network. Third, newly developed indicator, Q-measures, is applied to estimate the extent to which each country facilitates the knowledge flow between OECD countries and non-OECD countries. Next, we will introduce these measures in detail. 2.2.1. Degree centrality
In our study, degree centrality measures how many countries a given one has cooperated with. It focuses exclusively on the direct links between pairs of countries. This view of centrality is motivated by the idea that an individual who is close to have great influence ( Friedkin, 1991 ) than others. Thus, degree centrality is used to estimate both the country X  X  ability to access to external knowledge for itself and its power and influence on others in the network. 2.2.2. Flow betweenness
Direct links between pairs of countries do serve as efficient knowledge flow channels, but there is no reason to believe that knowledge flow between pairs of countries takes place only on the geodesic paths linking them, for it is quite possible that knowledge will take a circuitous route and channel through many intermediaries ( Freeman, Borgatti, &amp; White, 1991;
Stephenson &amp; Zelen, 1989 ). Thus, it is necessary to gauge the extent to which a country stands between others on the paths of indirect communication, i.e., its ability to inhabit and facilitate the knowledge flow among others. There are several betweenness centrality measures that can do this. We choose flow betweenness centrality for it takes edge weights, i.e., number of collaborations, into account.

Flow betweenness has been firstly developed by Freeman et al. (1991) . Considering a network with N countries, a numer-ical value is associated with each edge indicating the corresponding number of collaborations. If we think of the edges of the network as channels of knowledge flow, then the values of the links determine the capacity of the channel. Pairs of more close knowledge connected countries are linked by channels of higher capacity. Pairs who are less close are connected by channels of lower capacity. Let mf ( j , k ) be the maximum flow from point j to k , and let mf ( j i k ) be the maximum flow from j to k when node i and all its links are deleted. Then, in our undirected valued network, flow betweenness centrality of node i , denoted as C F ( i ), can be calculated as follows: where S  X  i  X  X f X  j ; k  X  : 1 6 j 6 N 1 ; j &lt; k 6 N ; j  X  i ; k  X  i g . Then C between other country-pairs would be lost if country i and all its cooperation connections are removed. For the network in
Fig. 1 , the C F (A1) = [(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1) (0+0+0+0+0+0+ 1) = 0.4615.

Flow betweenness centrality can measure the bridge function of actors within a group effectively. While sometimes the actors are of different classes in the network, we need to measure the interactions between the classes. For example, we clas-sify the countries into OECD group and non-OECD group in our study, and we are interested in the knowledge flow between these groups. More specially, we need to measure that to which extend the overall knowledge flow between two groups would be lost, if a given country and all of its collaboration relationships were removed. Q-measures are recently introduced network indicators for this kind of purpose ( Flom, Friedman, Strauss, &amp; Neaigus, 2004 ). It captures the idea of bridges be-tween two groups in a connected, undirected, and unvalued network and has been extended to directed and valued network by Rousseau and Zhang (2008) . Let us assume that there are N nodes in the undirected and valued network, and they are divided into two groups. Group one contains m nodes and group two contains n nodes; hence, N = m + n . If actor i belongs to group one, then the Q-measure, which is based on flow betweenness, for this actor in our undirected valued network can be defined as follows:
If actor i belongs to group two, then its Q-measure, which is based on flow betweenness, for this actor in our undirected val-ued network is defined as:
Q measures that to which extent the maximum knowledge flow between other country-pairs from two groups would be lost if country i and all its cooperation connections were removed. Thus, these Q-measures for weighted networks always range from zero to one. As an example, for the network in Fig. 1 , Q (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3)]/(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3) = 0.5417. 3. Empirical study
In this paper, we study the international knowledge flow in three periods, namely from 1981 to 1985, 1991 to 1995, and 2001 to 2005. It involves all countries taking part in USPTO patents during these periods. In our sample, the total number of patent granted, patents involved in international cooperation, and patents co-invented by more than two countries are listed in Table 1 for these periods. It shows an increasing share of international co-inventions. The international co-inventions are always dominated by the two-country pattern, while there is an obvious growth trend of multinational collaborations in-volved three or more countries.

The countries are divided into two classes, i.e., OECDs and non-OECDs. There are 24 countries having always been OECD members during our study periods and six other countries coming to be members between 1994 and 2000. We classify all these 30 countries into OECD group for comparability, and Czechoslovakia is used to represent Czech Republic and Slovak
Republic before their independence. The number of collaborations in patent are used to capture the intensities of knowledge flows among countries. Then, the analyses are carried out from four aspects, i.e., the overall distribution, flow betweenness,
Q-measures, and the closest bilateral knowledge flows perspectives. 3.1. The overall distribution of knowledge flows
Table 2 lists the descriptive statistics of patents granted, number of collaborations, and network degrees. Four tendencies are found in patent activities and international collaborations. First, there are more and more non-OECD economies taking part in international patent collaborations. In all study periods, all OECD countries have participated in international collab-orations, except for Czech Republic during 1991 X 1995 for its independence from Czechoslovakia. Meanwhile, there are 63 non-OECD economies having been granted at least one patent by USPTO, and 13 out of them are without any cross-border patent collaboration in period one. While since period two, all non-OECD patent participators cooperated with other countries. Secondly, the countries depend more on international cooperation during their patent activities. The number of collaborations have increased more rapidly than patents granted. The average patents granted to OECDs and non-OECDs have increased 2.54 and 11.38 times, while the number of collaborations for two groups have increased 9.27 and 15.53 times, respectively. Thirdly, it shows some decline in the concentration of patents and collaborations. Although patents and collab-orations remain highly concentrated in the hands of several OECD countries, the accumulative shares of patents and collab-orations for top 5, top 10, top 20, and OECD group have all slightly declined, indicating some kind of less concentration.
Shares of non-OECD group have increased gradually. Fourthly, they collaborate with more countries. The average number of collaborating partners has increased from 7.67 to 14.02 for the overall network, from 15.45 to 36.90 for the OECDs, and from 3.16 to 6.88 for the non-OECDs. It shows that countries seek more external knowledge than before from a much wider range.

The increasing extensive and in-depth international patent collaborations show the growing importance of external knowledge for domestic invention. As the science and technology are developing rapidly and the knowledge needed for rad-ical innovation comes to be more complex, the innovators found themselves in difficulties to master all the knowledge needed for their inventions. External knowledge from long distance is usually fresh, non-redundant, and complementary to the knowledge at hand and valuable for innovation. Therefore, cooperation with abroad counterparts helps to save time and reduce cost for innovations. Now, we are interested in how these increasing international knowledge interactions dis-tributed, are they evenly distributed globally or concentrated in the hands of just a relatively small number of dominators?
For this purpose, the distributions of international collaborations among countries are investigated. Scale correlations be-tween number of collaborations and their ranks are found. That is, there are power X  X aw relations like this, Y = kX
Y represents the number of collaborations and X indicates the ranks of them. The scale-free relationship shows high imbal-ance in the distribution of international collaborations. As shown in Table 3 , the values of scaling factors for all periods and all groups are less than 1.0. Scaling factors for overall networks and non-OECDs are increased all times, indicating a more uneven distribution of cross-border collaborations within the world and within the non-OECD countries. While for the OECDs, the scaling factor has decreased in the third period, showing a less uneven distribution within this group.
Table 4 shows to which extent the international knowledge flow through patent collaborations has happened within one group and to which extent they have happened between groups. In all periods, the collaborations within OECD group were dominant, while the collaborations within non-OECD group were the least. In period 1981 X 1985, the former was 361.9 times as the latter, while in period 2001 X 2005, the times turned to be 50.4, showing a great reduction in the uneven distribution of international knowledge diffusion. Number of collaborations of all kinds have increased rapidly. It increased 9.81 times for the OECD group, 13.39 times for the between groups, and 70.5 times for the non-OECD group, separately. In all periods, more than 80% collaborations have happened within OECD group, indicating that most of this kind of international knowledge interactions occurred among OECD countries. While the shares have increased for collaborations happened between groups and within non-OECD group, from 12.7% to 16.3% and from 0.2% to 1.6%. Although the non-OECD countries have taken part in more and more international patent collaborations, the OECD countries are still the main participators. Most of the collab-orations for non-OECD countries have happened with OECD countries, and the knowledge interactions within non-OECD countries are still seldom.

We have described the overall profile for the international knowledge flows above. Now, it is time to have a more detailed look into the country profiles. Table 5 lists the top 20 countries and regions that possess the most USPTO patents, that have the most international patent collaborations, and with the widest collaboration partners, respectively. In all periods and all items, the OECD countries take most of the top 20 places. There are 14 OECD countries ranking on top 20 in all periods and all items namely: the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, France, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Belgium, Australia, Austria, and Denmark. Comparing to OECD countries, the non-OECDs do not perform so stable.
There are nine non-OECD countries and regions having been listed on the top 20 in at least one item and in at least one per-iod. These are Israel, South Africa, Hong Kong, India, Taiwan, the mainland China, Singapore, Russian Federation, and the for-mer Soviet Union. Among them, Israel is the only non-OECD country that appears on top 20 for all items in all periods. For
Taiwan, its number of collaborations have increased fast, from 30 in period 1 to 1265 in period 3, along with the ranking rising from 24 to 12. At the same time, its collaboration partners have expanded from 2 to 27, with the ranking from 63 to 21. Singapore and Russian Federation both have deep (as indicated by number of collaborations) and wide (as indicated by degrees) international collaborations in recent period, indicating their raising importance in international knowledge flows. China and South Korea are the other two countries with rapidly increasing patent activities. For China, its number of collaborations changed from top 41 to 24 and then to 16 and its cooperation partners expanded from top 51 to 17 and then to 26 during the studied periods. At the same time, its patent number changed from top 56 to 26 and then to 20.
The international collaborations of China have increased slightly quicker than its patent numbers, showing a trend for more international knowledge interactions. While for South Korea, its number of collaborations and partners changed from top 43 to 18 and then to 18, from 45 to 33 and then to 18 during the studied periods, respectively. At the same periods, its patent number increased from top 27 to 11 and then to 5, showing a slower increasing in the international collaborations compar-ing with patent activities. South Africa once has outstanding performance in period 1981 X 1985, but it has been substituted by the rapidly growing China, Singapore, and Federation Russian. 3.2. Flow betweenness analysis
We have described the overall profiles of international knowledge flows through patent cooperation and the most active participators for external knowledge above. We now analyze the most important actors from the perspective of overall knowledge flows in this subsection, in order to check which countries would cause the most loss of max flow of the network if they and all of their links are deleted from the network. The bridgeness of countries for knowledge flow is measured by flow betweenness as defined in Section 2 . Table 6 presents the top 20 countries according to their flow betweenness values in each period.

The United States is with the maximum flow betweenness in all periods and acts as an extremely important bridge for international knowledge flows among other countries. Its flow betweenness surpassed 44% in all periods. It indicates that the sum of max knowledge flow between each pair of countries (except for the United States) would lose more than 44% if the United States and its entire links were deleted from the network. This high flow betweenness is not surprised when we recall that the United States is accompanying with the highest patent number, the most number of collaborations, and the widest cooperation partners. It is followed by Germany and the United Kingdom, with decreasing flow betweenness values during the study periods. France and Switzerland are listed as top 4 and top 5. Then, Japan and Canada come to top 6 and top 7 since period 1991 X 1995, showing an increasing importance in bridging international knowledge flows.
On the lists of top 20 for all periods, there are always 16 OECD countries and four non-OECD ones. The OECD countries perform quite steadily as 15 of them are always on the top 20. These are the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom,
France, Switzerland, Japan, Canada, Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Italy, Austria, Finland, Australia, and Denmark. And the only change happened with Norway, Spain, and South Korea in three periods separately. However, the performance of non-
OECD countries is not so consistent. Although its number of collaborations do not involved in top 20 in period 1 and 2 and its degrees do not rank on top 20 in period 1 (see Table 5 ), Singapore is the only non-OECD country listed on top 20 for all peri-ods according to its flow betweenness. It shows important contributions for international knowledge flows among other countries. The others are the former Soviet Union, South Africa, and Israel in period 1, the former Soviet Union, Israel, and
Russian Federation in period 2, and Taiwan, China, and Russian Federation in period 3. South Africa once has a remarkable performance in international patent collaborations (see its number of collaborations and degrees in Table 5 ) and knowledge flow bridgeness in period 1981 X 1985. But in recent periods, its significance has dropped down and it has been replaced by the rapidly growing new stars such as Taiwan, China, and Russian Federation. 3.3. The Q-measures analysis
Now we have inspected the bridgeness of actors for the overall network with the help of flow betweenness measures. We are also interested in their bridgeness between OECDs and non-OECDs, i.e., the main knowledge contributors and the main knowledge users. Q-measures, defined in Section 2 , are used to estimate the actors X  bridgeness between groups. They mea-sure to which extent the knowledge flow between groups would be lost if an appointed country and its entire links were removed. The top 20 countries are listed in Table 7 according to their Q-measures in each period.

Comparing with flow betweenness, the performances according to Q-measures are not so steady. As indicated by Table 7 , there are 12 OECD countries always ranking on top 20 for all periods, and they are the United States, Germany, the United
Kingdom, Japan, France, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, and Italy. Among them, the top three are the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom, which consist totally with flow betweenness. The United States still holds dominant position for knowledge flows between groups. Its Q-measures are even higher than its flow between-ness measures and exceed 48% in all periods. It means that the sum of international knowledge flows between pairs of coun-tries from different groups would lose more than 48% if the United States and its entire links were removed. For non-OECD countries, both the number and the highest ranking involved in top 20 have risen remarkably during these periods, from 3 to 7 and from 12 to 6, respectively. It shows increasing importance of non-OECDs as bridges between groups. Singapore is the only non-OECD country ranked on top 20 for all periods according to its flow betweenness measures. Combining with our findings in previous subsection, it shows that Singapore is not only an important bridge for overall international knowledge flows, but also a prominent connector between OECD group and non-OECD group. In period 1981 X 1985, there are only three non-OECDs on the list, i.e., the former Soviet Union, Singapore, and Iran, and the best ranking is 12. In period 1991 X 1995, the number rises to 6 while the highest ranking drops to 13 partly due to the disintegration of the Soviet Union. In the recent period 2001 X 2005, the number increases to 7 and the overall ranking ascends remarkably. There are three non-OECD coun-tries and regions coming up to top 10, and they are China, Taiwan, and Singapore. In the previous subsection, we have ana-lyzed that China and Taiwan are two dazzling new stars rising up recent years according to their rapid growth in patenting activities and patent collaborations and their growing importance in bridging the overall international knowledge flows.
Their functions of bridgeness are even more prominent when only the knowledge flows between groups are considered, as indicated by their Q-measures. China and Taiwan come up to top 6 and top 7 in period 3, respectively. They make rapidly growing contributions for international knowledge flows between the OECD countries and non-OECD countries. 3.4. The main bilateral knowledge flows
We have investigated the most active individual countries from both direct and indirect knowledge flow perspectives above. Now in this subsection, we focus on the most active country-pairs, i.e., the closest bilateral knowledge flows (the edges with the largest weights in the networks), among all countries and between two groups. Table 8 a presents the top 20 countries and regions with respect to bilateral knowledge flows among all countries according to their number of collabo-rations during these periods. Accordingly, Table 8 b shows the top 20 closest collaborations between OECD countries and non-OECD ones.

As shown by Table 8 a, the maximum bilateral number of collaborations has increased more than 10 times, from 380 to 4015, showing rapid increasing international knowledge flows. The closest collaborations are concentrated in the hands of a relatively small number of countries. There are 15 edges from 13 countries listed on the top 20 for all periods. Among these 13 countries, Israel is the only non-OECD country and it gets on the list due to its close collaborations with the United States. Taiwan and India are the other two economies which have got on the list for the same reasons as Israel in recent periods.
Both Taiwan and India have achieved great economic success and worked hard to move up the international technology lad-der in recent decades. Their close collaborations with the United States, on the one hand, show their benefiting from external western knowledge. On the other hand, it shows the attentions from the United States to the rapid growing of newly industrialized economies. Table 8 b further indicates that the closest knowledge flows between OECD and non-OECD coun-tries have been dominated by the United States, especially in period 2 and 3. There are eight edges from three OECD coun-tries and seven non-OECD countries and regions listed on the top 20 closest knowledge flows between groups for all periods.
And among them, six edges are related to the United States. Those top non-OECDs are Israel, Taiwan, and India. The collab-orations of the United States with China, Singapore, and Russian Federation have increased both in numbers and in ranks. Countries and regions involved in Table 8 a have increased from 13 to 15 and then to 16 during these periods considered.
Considering the subnetwork involving these countries and links, the United States and Germany have the highest degree centralities for all periods. For each period, there are 11, 13, and 14 edges related to the United States and 7, 7, and 6 edges connected with Germany, separately. Except for Austria that has been involved in the networks for its collaborations with Germany, all countries have collaborated with the United States. Besides the United States and Germany, France,
Switzerland, and Great Kingdom are the other three countries with degrees larger than one in all periods. The closest rela-tionships, as indicated by the size of edges, are mainly held by the United States, except for relationship between Germany and Switzerland. There are 19, 21, and 20 countries involved in the subnetwork formed by Table 8 b for three periods, sep-arately. Two tendencies are found. First, the knowledge flows between groups have been more dominated by the United
States. In period 1981 X 1985, there are nine edges from the United States, four edges from Germany, and four edges from the United Kingdom. The United States does have the highest degree, but it is not the only ruler in this period. While in the period 2 and 3, its degree rose to 14 and 13, respectively, and it comes to be the absolute dominator. It indicates that the United States not only holds most of the overall international knowledge flows but also controls most of the knowledge flows between groups. Secondly, the United States has developed close relationships with more non-OECDs. In period 1981 X  1985, the closest collaboration happens between the United States and Israel with 81 collaborations, which is nearly three times of the second closest collaboration between the United States and Hong Kong. In period 1991 X 1995, the number of collaborations of the United States and Taiwan are close to those of the United States and Israel. In period 2001 X 2005, the important non-OECD partners of the United States extend to Israel, Taiwan, India, Singapore, Russian Federation, China, and Hong Kong. It shows that the United States has developed deep and close collaborations with more non-OECD countries. 4. Conclusions
This paper examines the cross-border patent collaborations at national level in three periods, i.e., 1981 X 1985, 1991 X 1995, and 2001 X 2005, to capture the profiles of the international knowledge flows. All countries are classified into two groups, i.e., the main knowledge creators-OECD group and the main knowledge users-non-OECD group, in order to distinguish charac-teristics of knowledge flows within groups and between groups. Degree centrality measures are used to estimate the coun-tries X  ability to directly access to external knowledge for themselves and their direct power and influence to others in the network. The flow betweenness measures are applied to gauge the countries X  ability to inhabit and facilitate the knowledge flows among others in the network, and the Q-measures are employed to evaluate the countries X  bridgeness between two groups. Several remarkable tendencies about the overall international knowledge flows are found, and the most important countries and closest bilateral collaborations are discovered in our empirical study.

First, countries depend more and more on international collaborations in their patenting activities. Since period 1991 to 1995, almost all patenting countries have taken part in cross-border collaborations and the average collaboration partners have increased nearly two times. The average number of collaborations for each county has increased more than six times during the 20 years, much quicker than the increasing of patents granted.

Secondly, the international collaborations mainly happened within the OECD group, while the shares for collaborations within non-OECD group and between groups have increased all the time. The international collaborations distribute highly unevenly among countries, as the number of collaborations and their ranks follow power X  X aw distributions. OECD countries possess more than 90% international collaborations and more than 80% collaborations happen within OECD group. They are dominators in the international knowledge flows. Meanwhile, the participations of non-OECD countries for international external knowledge grow steadily during the study periods. The shares of between groups and within non-OECD group col-laborations have increased from 12.7% to 16.3% and from 0.2% to 1.6%, respectively.
 Thirdly, when we consider the countries X  bridgeness for knowledge flows among others, the top 20 are mostly taken by
OECD countries, but the non-OECD countries show significant rising importance, especially in bridging flows between groups. The United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom are the most important countries not only for the overall net-work knowledge flows but also for the between groups knowledge flows. Singapore and Israel are two important non-OECD ones according to their flow betweenness measures and Q-measures. Due to their fast developed international patent activ-ities and collaborations, China and Taiwan are the most outstanding new stars. Their importance in facilitating knowledge flows among others, especially in bridging the flows between two groups, have rose rapidly. Iran and South Africa once have significant performance, but they have been replaced by the rapidly growing China and Taiwan.

Fourthly, the closest bilateral collaborations are mainly concentrated in the hands of a relatively small number of OECD countries, especially the United States and Germany. Israel, Taiwan, and India are the only non-OECDs listed on the top 20 for their close collaborations with the United States. When considering the closest bilateral knowledge flows between groups, the United States comes to be the exclusive dominator since period 1991 X 1995 and it has developed close relationships with more non-OECD countries.
In conclusion, most of the international knowledge flows through patent collaborations still take place within the OECD group, and the OECD countries play important roles in facilitating the knowledge flows among all countries. While the non-OECD countries participate more and more in international patent and collaboration activities along with the study periods. Their importance in facilitating knowledge flows among others has been improved significantly. Among them, China and
Taiwan are two most dazzling new stars. In consideration of their rising importance in international knowledge flows with their rapid improved economic competiveness, it may indicate that the wide and deep international knowledge participation helps their catch-up strategy greatly.
