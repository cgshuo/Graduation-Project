 Information generated by multiple authors working indepen-dently at different times when analyzed synergistically re-veals more information than apparent. For example, a tradi-tional search for connections between the trucking industry and Iraqi banks may not produce any documents mentioning both. However, a search that follows trails of associations across documents may suggest a connection between an auto parts manufacturer who exports to Iraq, and an Iraqi bank providing loans to buy cars. The work described here ex-tends link analysis based on named entities and labeled re-lationships to general concepts and unnamed associations. Unapparent Information Revelation involves finding chains connecting concepts across documents: it uses a new repre-sentation formalism called Concept Chain Graphs.

A document collection often reveals interesting informa-tion other than what is explicitly stated since documents are generated by many authors working asynchronously and/or independently. Interesting links that connect facts and as-sertions across documents emerge upon close analysis: it is a formidable task to spot them manually. We refer to this special case of text mining as Unapparent Information Rev-elation .

This paper focuses on UIR problems which are relevant to homeland security. Experiments involved processing data related to 9/11 events with the focus on generating Concept Chains. The solution pursued here formulates the concepts  X 
This work is sponsored by NSF grant IIS-0325404 and a research grant from the FAA 032-G-009 (nodes) and associations (edges) as a probabilistic graph termed as a Concept Chain Graph (CCG). A document is viewed as a sub-graph of this probabilistic network; unlike IR models, the CCG explicitly represents connections across documents. These connections are the basis of tracking Con-cept Chains.
The DARPA Evidence Extraction and Link Discovery covery techniques. [1] gives a good survey of IR techniques applied to text mining, including latent semantic indexing (LSI)which is useful for trend analysis but for tasks such as finding the most plausible connection between two organi-zations, finer granularity is required. Work by Faloutsos [2] proposes modelling associations between people as finding a connection subgraph based on electricity analogues. The Primary difference with our approach is usage of URL links to establish connections between documents as opposed to content (textual) analysis.

Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of the UIR system. It consists of the CCG building component and the UIR toolkit component which supports the text mining functionality including Keyword and Ontological search as well as Concept Chain generation.
The InfoXtract engine was employed[3] to tag Named En-tities and perform shallow parsing of the text in order to extract salient concepts and associations used in construct-ing the CCG. Concepts were automatically mapped to an using WordNet hypernymic features.
 This work involves a 2-level Markov model defined on CCG: the first level uses a Markov Graph representation in order to find the best chain of a given length connecting two concepts. The second level is an HMM used to retrieve the best set of documents that could have generated the chain.

Transition Probabilities on the Concept Markov Graph are estimated using a notion of contextual similarity by mea-suring vector distance between context vectors of two con-cepts which is the union of term vectors of the concept and its neighbors.

Now for any concept C i and C j , the transition probability is given as
P ( C i , C j ) =
Where sim C i , C j is the similarity between the context vectors of concept C i and concept C j . Supporting text snippets are generated using Document Set Retrieval HMM (DocSetHMM). The formalism can be described as:
Let D i and D j be any two documents in the collection, the transition probability between them is given by: where, n is the total number of documents in the corpus. Self transition probability is P ( D i , D i ) = 1 . 0
Emission probability is the probability of observing a con-cept or association given a document. For an association A the emission probability from document D j is where, count ( A i , D j ) gives the total number of times A occurs in D j i.e. the count of instances of A i in D j .
The data set was generated by considering sections of the 9/11 commission report and the staff statements and mono-graphs from the National Commission on Terrorist attacks upon United States. The chains were evaluated using Task Based Evaluation measures simulating a real analysts work. A sample chain and its explanation is presented here. Chain Retrieved : Cole  X  Khallad  X  Fund  X  Taliban Cole and Khallad connection depicts his involvement in USS Cole bombing. Khallad to fund connection exists be-cause Khallad received funds from another Al-Qaeda op-erative. The last association is generated because Taliban along with Al-Qaeda had repatriated funds from banks in the United Kingdom and Germany to Afghanistan.
This paper has defined the problem of UIR and explic-itly takes into account connections across documents. An indexing and retrieval framework for UIR, namely the CCG has been presented which can be employed for traditional IR as well as UIR applications. Future work includes more quantitative benchmarking by applying it to standard data sets such as TREC. We are also working on enhancing UIR solutions by incorporating more sophisticated probabilistic graph models such as Markov Random Fields to discover patterns of activity which warrant attention.
