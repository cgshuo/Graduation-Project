 Key Infrastructures (PKIs) to support the various web applications [2]. Based on web technology, ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) can promptly reflect the changes of the market requirements and help the enterprise to select the appropriate collaborators to do transactions [3]. To guarantee the security of the business information, the cor-responding PKIs of the enterprise and the collaborators should be dynamically inter-operated.
 principal and the collaborators play as subordinate. Therefore, the corresponding PKIs also have the  X  X rincipal and subordinate X  relationships. 
According to these specialties, this paper proposes an efficient scheme. Based on the new PKI insures the secure transactions between the enterprise and its collaborators. some conceptions in PKI are formalized. Then, our proposed scheme and the certificate processing are described in detail based on these formal definitions. Section 3 analyzes clusion. Our proposed scheme is based on the following assumptions: According to the market conceptions of PKI are formalized. 2.1 Definition sents the additional data. then c a  X  . 2.2 The Merging Process Our proposed scheme is to quickly merge the *  X  and i  X  into a new hierarchical PKI Fig.1). words, the certificate of CA* must be securely stored by every entities. Then, to com-the scheme needs keep i  X  as integrate and independent as possible. Our scheme attains certificates of i  X  . 
No matter which collaborator it is, the merging process is the same. Thus, we take follows: key store * * CA CA Cert and trust the new root certificate authority CA* . { (4). n CA sends the message maintaining its previous public key for its new certificate. in set n U still use their previous certificates, which are issued by n CA ( = u pendence as before. 2.3 Certificate Verification in New PKI After merging, the new PKI can provide many security services (like confidentiality, information integrity etc.) for the enterprise X  X  business processing. However, all these services are based on the correct certificate verification among the entities. 2.3.1 Certificate Verification Between *  X  and i  X  ) 1 ( n i  X   X  The main purpose of our merging scheme is to guarantee the secure transactions be-verification path between the transmission participators.
 2.3.2 Certificate Verification in i  X  ) 1 ( n i  X   X  As we have mentioned in 2.2, every PKI( i  X  ) maintains its structure integrity and keep change. In order to conserve space, we will not describe it here in detail. (1) Efficient Merging Process However, in that method, a great amount of certificates need to be issued. Based on the have to be issued. Such few certificates issuances make the r econstruction process quick and low-cost. That particularly meets the requirements of the dynamic changes of PKIs in ERP. (2) Efficient Certificate Verification in New PKI Till now, the mesh CA model and the Bridge CA model [1][4][5] are the most common struction and verification. In contrast to them, from the description in 2.2, we can see such process is simple and efficient in our scheme. Moreover, based on the same above the bridge CA model, n 2 cross certificates are needed. In this paper, a problem of merging multiple PKI in ERP is considered. According to formal approach is also used to describe the conceptions in PKI. Compared with those which satisfies the requirements of the dynamic changes of PKIs in ERP . In our future works, the performance analyses will be finished in formal ways.
