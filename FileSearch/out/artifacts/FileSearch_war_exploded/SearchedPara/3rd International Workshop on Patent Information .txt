 The 3rd International Workshop on Patent Information Re-trieval builds on the experiences of the first two workshops, to provide its participants an exciting, scientifically chal-lenging and interactive event, where specific issues of patent retrieval may be put into the general context of Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management, in order to explore innovative solutions to new and old problems, but also to evaluate and adapt traditional or classic approaches to new problems. Between scientific presentations and posters, dis-tinguished keynote speakers and a panel discussion, PaIR 2010 shapes itself into a significant landmark in the field of domain specific information retrieval.
 H.0 [ Information Systems Applications ]: General Documentation Patent Retrieval
Patent Information Retrieval is an active and challenging field both for researchers and for professional information specialists. Patents play a key role not only in protecting intellectual property but also as a strategic business fac-tor in all modern economies. Despite enormous advances in Information Retrieval techniques in the past few years, advanced search tools for patent professionals are still in their infancy, so the research in patent retrieval represents an important opportunity both for academic and industrial research. Patent search is a particular challenge to informa-tion retrieval and access systems. Amongst the challenges successful patent search systems of the future will have to face we can count:
We can group this year X  X  accepted papers into three cat-egories: first, there is the work of Krishnan, Cardenas and Springer ( Search for Patents Using Treatment and Causal Relationships ), which, together with that of Nanba, Kondo and Takezawa ( Automatic Creation of a Technical Trend Map from Research Papers and Patents ) constitute a so-called  X  X emantic discovery and use X  group.
 Then, the issue of language is addressed: Andersson ( A Vector Space analysis of Swedish patent claims with differ-ent linguistic indices ) addresses how text processing features affect the retrieval process, while language style variations in different patents or parts of the patents are discussed by Oostdijk, Halteren, D X  X ondt and Verberne in Genre and Do-main in Patent Texts . For multilingual search, Jochim, Li-oma, Sch  X  utze, Koch and Ertl ( Preliminary Study into Query Translation for Patent Retrieval ) talk about helping retrieval by translating queries.

Finally, the evaluation of patent retrieval systems also rep-resents an area of interest. From laboratory style evalua-tion, presented by Lupu, Piroi and Hanbury in Aspects and Analysis of Patent Test Collections , to demos described by Hristidis, Ruiz, Hern  X andez, Fraf  X an and Varadarajan in Pat-entsSearcher: A Novel Portal to Search and Explore Patents , via specific feature comparisons as those done by Harris, Arens ad Srinivasan ( Comparison of IPC and USPC Clas-sification Systems in Patent Prior Art Searches )
We are very proud to have two very distinguished keynote speakers at this year X  X  Patent Information Retrieval work-shop: Mary Carman, Commissioner of Patents, Registrar of Trademarks and CEO of the Canadian Intellectual Property Office and Marti Hearst, Chief IT Strategist for the USPTO, on leave from the School of Information at UC Berkeley. At the time of writing of this summary, a title and abstract of the talk was only available from Marti Hearst, who will sum-marize the user research we have conducted so far and pose research challenges that if addressed may help examiners X  search needs in future.

In addition to the keynote speakers, the poster session will increase interaction between all participants, and give th em the opportunity to demonstrate and test how some of the systems work. In particular, the creators of the PatensSear cher system will give a demonstration of the system. The dis-cussion then will be taking a more guided direction, in the form of a Panel discussion. This will help crystalize ideas that otherwise may only be circulated in bilateral conver-sations or presented in a unidirectional form through paper presentations.
This year we received 10 paper submissions. In the end 4 were accepted for presentation as full papers and 5 as short papers. The programme committee consisted of 23 mem-bers, and each paper was reviewed, on average, 3.6 times. On the usual scale between -3 (strong reject) and 3 (strong accept), the papers received on average a positive score of 1.09. The average score of the full papers was 1.78, while that of short papers was 1.16.
We hope that these papers, together with the demo, posters and panel session, will trigger interesting conversations and future development in IP search, through a closer collabora -tion between researchers and industry representatives. We also hope that the workshop will be a springboard for many future events and lead to the recognition of patent search-ing as one of the central areas of research in Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management, and one of the key-players in a knowledge-driven innovative society.
On our path to PaIR X 10, we have received the generous and important contribution of many people, whom we need to acknowledge and to whom we wish to express our grat-itude. First of all we would like to thank the authors for submitting so many papers of high quality. We would also like to thank the workshop programme committee for their dedicated and careful review of the papers. Many thanks go as well to the organizers of CIKM both for providing us with the opportunity to hold the workshop and for their support and advice during our preparation for it.
