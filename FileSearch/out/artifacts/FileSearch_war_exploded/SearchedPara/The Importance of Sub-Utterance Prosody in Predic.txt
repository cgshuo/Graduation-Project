 School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Prosody is a fundamental part of human-to-human spoken communication; it can affect the syntac-tic and semantic interpretation of an utterance (Hirschberg, 2003) and it can be used by speakers to convey their emotional state. In recent years, re-searchers have found prosodic features to be useful in automatically detecting emotions such as annoy-ance and frustration (Ang et al., 2002) and in dis-tinguishing positive from negative emotional states (Lee and Narayanan, 2005).

In this paper, we address the problem of predict-ing the perceived level of certainty of a spoken ut-terance. Specifically, we have a corpus of utter-ances where it is possible to isolate a single word or phrase responsible for the speaker X  X  level of cer-tainty. With this corpus we investigate whether us-ing prosodic features of the word or phrase causing uncertainty and of its surrounding context improves the prediction accuracy when compared to using fea-tures taken only from the utterance as a whole.
This work goes beyond existing research by look-ing at the predictive power of prosodic features ex-tracted from salient sub-utterance segments. Pre-vious work on uncertainty has examined the pre-dictive power of utterance-and intonational phrase-level prosodic features (Liscombe et al., 2005) as well as the relative strengths of correlations between level of certainty and sub-utterance prosodic fea-tures (Pon-Barry, 2008). Our results suggest that we can do a better job at predicting an utterance X  X  perceived level of certainty by using prosodic fea-tures extracted from the whole utterance plus ones extracted from salient pieces of the utterance, with-out increasing the total number of features, than by using only features from the whole utterance.
This work is relevant to spoken language applica-tions in which the system knows specific words or phrases that are likely to cause uncertainty. For ex-ample, this would occur in a tutorial dialogue system when the speaker answers a direct question (Pon-Barry et al., 2006; Forbes-Riley et al., 2008), or in language (foreign or ESL) learning systems and lit-eracy systems (Alwan et al., 2007) when new vocab-ulary is being introduced. Researchers have examined certainty in spoken lan-guage using data from tutorial dialogue systems (Liscombe et al., 2005) and data from an uncertainty corpus (Pon-Barry, 2008).

Liscombe et al. (2005) trained a decision tree classifier on utterance-level and intonational phrase-level prosodic features to distinguish between cer-tain, uncertain, and neutral utterances. They achieved 76% accuracy, compared to a 66% accu-racy baseline (choosing the most common class).
We have collected a corpus of utterances spoken under varying levels of certainty (Pon-Barry, 2008). The utterances were elicited by giving adult native English speakers a written sentence containing one or more gaps, then displaying multiple options for filling in the gaps and telling the speakers to read the sentence aloud with the gaps filled in according to domain-specific criteria. We elicited utterances in two domains: (1) using public transportation in Boston, and (2) choosing vocabulary words to com-plete a sentence. An example is shown below. Q: How can I get from Harvard to the Silver Line? A: Take the red line to The term  X  X ontext X  refers to the fixed part of the re-sponse (  X  X ake the red line to  X , in this exam-ple) and the term  X  X arget word X  refers to the word or phrase chosen to fill in the gap.

The corpus contains 600 utterances from 20 speakers. Each utterance was annotated for level of certainty, on a 5-point scale, by five human judges who listened to the utterances out of context. The average inter-annotator agreement (Kappa) was 0 . 45 . We refer to the average of the five ratings as the  X  X erceived level of certainty X  (the quantity we at-tempt to predict in this paper).

We computed correlations between perceived level of certainty and prosodic features extracted from the whole utterance, the context, and the tar-get word. Pauses preceding the target word were considered part of the target word; all segmenta-tion was done manually. Because the speakers had unlimited time to read over the context before see-ing the target words, the target word is considered to be the source of the speaker X  X  confidence or un-certainty; it corresponds to the decision that the speaker had to make. Our correlation results sug-gest that while some prosodic cues to level of cer-tainty were strongest in the whole utterance, others were strongest in the context or the target word. In this paper, we extend this past work by testing the prediction accuracy of models trained on different subsets of these prosodic features. In our experiments we used 480 of the 600 utter-ances in the corpus, those which contained exactly one gap. (Some had two or three gaps.) We ex-tracted the following 20 prosodic feature-types from each whole utterance, context, and target word (a to-tal of 60 features) using WaveSurfer 1 and Praat 2 . Pitch: minf0, maxf0, meanf0, stdevf0, rangef0, rel-Intensity: minRMS, maxRMS, meanRMS, stdev-Temporal: total silence, percent silence, total dura-These features are comparable to those used in Lis-combe et al. X  X  (2005) prediction experiments. The pitch and intensity features were represented as z -scores normalized by speaker; the temporal fea-tures were not normalized.

Next, we created a  X  X ombination X  set of 20 fea-tures based on our correlation results. Figure 1 il-lustrates how the combination set was created: for each prosodic feature-type (each row in the table) we chose either the whole utterance feature, the context feature, or the target word feature, whichever one had the strongest correlation with perceived level of certainty. The selected features (highlighted in Fig-ure 1) are listed below.
 Whole Utterance: total silence, total duration, Context: minf0, maxf0, meanf0, stdevf0, rangef0, Target Word: percent silence, speaking rate, rela-
To compare the prediction accuracies of different subsets of features, we fit five linear regression mod-els to the feature sets. The five subsets are: (A) whole utterance features only, (B) target word fea-tures only, (C) context features only, (D) all fea-tures, and (E) the combination feature set. We di-vided the data into 20 folds (one fold per speaker) and performed a 20-fold cross-validation for each set of features. Each experiment fits a model us-ing data from 19 speakers and tests on the remain-ing speaker. Thus, when we test our models, we are testing the ability to classify utterances of an unseen speaker.

Table 1 shows the accuracies of the models trained on the five subsets of features. The num-bers reported are averages of the 20 cross-validation accuracies. We report results for two cases: 5 pre-diction classes and 3 prediction classes. We first computed the prediction accuracy over five classes (the regression output was rounded to the nearest integer). Next, in order to compare our results to those of Liscombe et al. (2005), we recoded the 5-class results into 3-class results, following Pon-Barry (2008), in the way that maximized inter-annotator agreement. The naive baseline numbers are the accuracies that would be achieved by always choosing the most common class. Assuming that the target word is responsible for the speaker X  X  level of certainty, it is not surprising that the target word feature set (B) yields higher accura-cies than the context feature set (C). It is also not sur-prising that the set of all features (D) yields higher accuracies than sets (A), (B), and (C).

The key comparison to notice is that the combi-nation feature set (E), with only 20 features, yields higher average accuracies than the utterance fea-ture set (A): a difference of 6 . 42% for 5 classes and 5 . 83% for 3 classes. This suggests that using a combination of features from the context and target word in addition to features from the whole utter-ance leads to better prediction of the perceived level of certainty than using features from only the whole utterance.

One might argue that these differences are just due to noise. To address this issue, we compared the prediction accuracies of sets (A) and (E) per fold. This is illustrated in Figure 2. Each fold in our cross-validation corresponds to a different speaker, so the folds are not identically distributed and we do not expect each fold to yield the same prediction accu-racy. That means that we should compare predic-tions of the two feature sets within folds rather than between folds. Figure 2 shows the correlations be-tween the predicted and perceived levels of certainty for the models trained on sets (A) and (E). The com-bination set (E) predictions were more strongly cor-related than whole utterance set (A) predictions in 16 out of 20 folds. This result supports our claim that using a combination of features from the con-text and target word in addition to features from the whole utterance leads to better prediction of level of certainty.

Our best prediction accuracy for the 3 class case, 74 . 79% , was slightly lower than the accuracy re-ported by Liscombe et al. (2005), 76 . 42% . However, our difference from the naive baseline was 18 . 54% where Liscombe et al. X  X  was 10 . 42% . Liscombe et al. randomly divided their data into training and test sets, so it is unclear whether they tested on seen or unseen speakers. Further, they ran one experiment rather than a cross-validation, so their reported ac-curacy may not be indicative of the entire data set.
We also trained support vector models on these subsets of features. The main result was the same: the set of all features (D) and the combination set (E) had better prediction accuracies than the utter-ance feature set (A). In addition, the combination set (E) had the best prediction accuracies (of all models) in both the 3-and 5-class settings. The raw accura-cies were approximately 5% lower than those of the linear regression models. The results of our experiments suggest a better pre-dictive model of level of certainty for systems where words or phrases likely to cause uncertainty are known ahead of time. Without increasing the total number of features, combining select prosodic fea-tures from the target word, the surrounding context and the whole utterance leads to better prediction of level of certainty than using features from the whole utterance only. In the near future, we plan to exper-iment with prediction models of the speaker X  X  self-reported level of certainty.
