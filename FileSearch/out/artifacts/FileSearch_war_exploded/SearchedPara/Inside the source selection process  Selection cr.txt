 1. Introduction
In research concerning knowledge management and information sharing in organizations, there is an increasing focus on the benefits that can be derived from one X  X  social relationships with co-workers (e.g., Adler &amp; Kwon, 2002; Hansen, Mors, &amp; L X va  X  s, 2005; Kogut &amp; Zander, 1992; McFadyen &amp; Albert, 2004; Smith, Col-1998 ). For instance, social relationships offer the possibility to identify and contact relevant co-workers to exchange information ( Nahapiet &amp; Ghoshal, 1998 ). With the popularization of the concept of social capital in knowledge and information management, there has been an increased interest as to how to facilitate the use of human information sources within organizations. One widely held idea is to create IT solutions that help to identify co-workers with potentially relevant information. However, although having the opportunity to con-nect to others is a necessary condition for the use of human information sources, this paper argues that it is not sufficient to ensure actual use.

To further facilitate employees to use these sources, insight is needed into when and why workers choose to exploit such opportunities in organizations. A significant and growing body of research has addressed this question before (see e.g., Gerstberger &amp; Allen, 1968; Hardy, 1982; Marton &amp; Choo, 2002; Morrison &amp; Van-couver, 2000; O X  X eilly, 1982 ). In particular, the influence of two factors on employees X  use of various types of information sources is explored: accessibility and quality. Unfortunately, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the two factors X  relative importance in the selection of human information sources in organizations.
Not only is there disagreement on the role of accessibility and quality, but the methods that are traditionally used in these studies are also subject to debate. A recent series of studies have called for methods that enable more detailed and direct assessments of employees X  actual use of selection criteria instead of relying on employees X  perceptions about such use (see Fidel &amp; Green, 2004; Hertzum, 2002 ).

The purpose of this study is twofold. First, the value of a think aloud approach to the study of human source selection in organizations is explored. Direct and detailed observations of how workers actually use source selection criteria are gathered by letting employees think aloud during the selection of human informa-tion sources. Second, in taking such a new approach, this paper aims to provide more insight into the relative role of accessibility and quality in the selection of human information sources within an organizational context. 2. Related work 2.1. The role of accessibility and quality in source selection Research on source selection in organizations began in the 1960s with renowned studies by Gerstberger and
Allen (1968) and Rosenberg (1967) . It quickly focused on the role of accessibility versus quality in the selection of various types of information sources, including human information sources. Numerous studies have found that employees consider the accessibility of sources: those sources that require the least effort to access are more likely to be used ( Curley, Connelly, &amp; Rich, 1990; Gerstberger &amp; Allen, 1968; Hardy, 1982; O X  X eilly, 1982 ). In addition, research shows that employees also consider the quality of a source when deciding which information source to use ( Choo, Detlor, &amp; Turnbull, 2000; Hertzum, 2002; Kremer, 1980; Vancouver &amp; Mor-rison, 1995 ). However, the relative importance of accessibility and quality is subject to debate. Studies have produced contradictory results (compare Borgatti &amp; Cross, 2003; Chakrabarti, Feineman, &amp; Fuentevilla, 1983; Gerstberger &amp; Allen, 1968; Morrison &amp; Vancouver, 2000; Xu, Tan, &amp; Yang, 2006 ).
Over the years, several explanations have been advanced to reconcile these contradictions. To begin with, most of the studies are not very attentive to the multiple meanings associated with these concepts (see for an overview of these meanings, Culnan, 1985; Fidel &amp; Green, 2004 ). For example, Pinelli, Bishop, Barclay, and
Kennedy (1993) view accessibility strictly in terms of the physical distance between the information seeker and the source, while Vancouver and Morrison (1995) restrict their operationalization of accessibility to the source X  X  availability. Other authors also include such aspects as the effort involved in obtaining information from the source ( Marton &amp; Choo, 2002 ) or feeling comfortable with a source (E. Morrison, personal commu-nication, April 22, 2003). Due to this wide variety of conceptualizations, researchers essentially have looked at different construals of both concepts when interpreting their relative importance ( Fidel &amp; Green, 2004 ). How-ever, as Fidel and Green (2004) found, the importance of aspects of accessibility and quality in source selec-tion within organizations varies: some aspects of accessibility (or quality) are of greater consequence than others.

In addition, studies in this particular research area often include multiple types of information sources (e.g., documentary and human information sources). When assessing the influence of accessibility and quality, the ratings of these different types of information are taken together ( Gerstberger &amp; Allen, 1968; Hardy, 1982;
Morrison &amp; Vancouver, 2000 ). In retrospect, making such aggregations seems unwise. Recently, both Fidel and Green (2004) and Hertzum (2002) have found significant differences in the role of accessibility and quality between human information sources and documentary sources. As the proportion of documentary and human information sources differs between studies, this may lead to contradictory research findings. 2.2. The need for a different research approach
The discussed potential explanations for existing inconsistencies in research findings have important impli-cations for conducting research into the respective roles of accessibility and quality in organizational source selection. First of all, in order to provide further insight into these roles, the multiple meanings associated with the concepts of accessibility and quality should be further examined. The common research approach  X  mass questionnaires ( De Alwis, Majid, &amp; Chaudry, 2006 )  X  does not seem suitable for this. The criteria in these questionnaires are either treated as self-explanatory, described in general terms, or operationalized using mul-tiple items based on a priori developed interpretations of the researcher (compare, for example, Connelly,
Rich, Curley, &amp; Kelly, 1990; Culnan, 1983; Gerstberger &amp; Allen, 1968; Morrison &amp; Vancouver, 2000 ). No means are offered for respondents to indicate their interpretations. In order to reveal these, more open-ended research techniques are needed that allow for an examination of observed interpretations ( Halpern &amp; Nilan, 1988; Nilan, Peek, &amp; Snyder, 1988 ).

Secondly, in studying the role of accessibility and quality, researchers should be attentive to variations in this role between different types of sources. Thus, the role of accessibility and quality should be established for human and documentary sources separately.

In addition, some authors claim that the traditional way of conducting research into the role of accessibility versus quality in work-related source selection is faulty in yet another way; findings from such studies may reflect what employees think is important in source selection rather than what they actually do ( Fidel &amp; Green, 2004 ). In most previous studies, measures of accessibility and quality are based on respondents X  perceptions of the importance of these criteria. Respondents were asked either to rank or rate sources in terms of accessibility and quality or to indicate the importance of these criteria in organizational source selection ( De Alwis et al., 2006 ). In order to do so, respondents have to observe their own thinking and reflect on its characteristics. The resulting answers are not automatically accurate. They can be seriously distorted due to incomplete or false recall, depending on the respondents X  ability and willingness to provide valid information on the cognitive pro-cesses that mediate their behavior ( Ericsson, 1998 ). Fidel and Green (2004) therefore call for studies that incorporate assessments of the actual use of source selection criteria by employees. 2.3. New research methods
Lately, several studies have attempted to address the problems that were previously described. They differ-entiate results between documentary and human information sources, use more open-ended methods to exam-ine interpretations of accessibility and quality and try to directly assess the role of accessibility and quality by studying employees X  actual use of criteria rather than relying on what they think is important in source selec-tion (see, for example, Fidel &amp; Green, 2004; Hertzum, 2002 ). However, finding valid ways to make such more direct assessments proves to be difficult. In search of methods to assess the actual use employees make of accessibility and quality in the selection of human information sources, researchers have, for example, turned to direct observation of group discussions in which source selection takes place ( Hertzum, 2002 ) or the critical incident technique ( Fidel &amp; Green, 2004 ). It remains to be seen whether these methods are suitable to validly assess the actual use of source selection criteria.

When observing group discussions, concerns arise, about the completeness of such observations. Certain pre-selections already may have taken place in participants X  minds before suggesting a particular source or before sharing certain considerations with the rest of the group. To illustrate this, Hertzum did not find  X  X  X eel-ing comfortable with a source X  X  to be a consideration in source selection based on his observations of group discussions. Yet, various other studies did find this to be a factor influencing source selection ( Allen, 1977;
Cross &amp; Borgatti, 2004; Fidel &amp; Green, 2004 ). Of course, publicly admitting such a concern may be embarrassing.

In addition, it is questionable whether the critical incident technique (in which participants describe partic-ular information seeking incidents and answer questions about these incidents) studies actual use. Although asking questions about critical incidents limits the necessity to abstract perceptions from highly variable expe-riences, the technique is still focused on participants X  views. Participants X  use of criteria is not directly observed but is based on frequency reports of what participants think has influenced their decision to use a source.
Problems with incomplete and false recall can still occur. In fact, recall problems already start to increase when there is a time interval of more than 5 X 10 s between the moment that a thought occurs and its verbal report ( Ericsson, 1998 ).

To provide a more direct assessment of people X  X  use of accessibility and quality in the selection of human information sources, we need a way to investigate source selection from within people X  X  minds. This makes it possible to identify thoughts at the moment they occur. In order to do so, this paper argues that a simpler process needs to be assumed: verbalization instead of observation or introspection ( van Someren, Barnard, &amp; Sandberg, 1994 ). By letting participants think aloud while selecting human information sources, thoughts are merely expressed without participants needing to reflect or explain them afterwards. In addition, by think-ing aloud the whole source selection process can be traced as opposed to observing only those thoughts that are expressed in group discussions. The resulting verbal protocols can be subsequently analyzed.

A considerable amount of research ( Biggs &amp; Rosman, 1993; Payne, Braunstein, &amp; Caroll, 1978; Schweiger, 1983 ) shows that verbal protocols can provide valuable and valid data. In fact, the think aloud method has already successfully been used in studies in the wider field of information seeking and use (e.g., Birru et al., 2004; Eveland &amp; Dunwoody, 2000; Hofer, 2004; Quiroga &amp; Mostafa, 2002; Rieh, 2001 ). However, these stud-ies generally focus on the use of relevance criteria in the selection of documentary information sources for scholarly or personal purposes, e.g., document selection from bibliographic retrieval systems ( Wang &amp; Soer-gel, 1998 ), selection of information from the Web for personal purposes ( Rieh, 2001 ) or learning ( Hofer, 2004 ), or information from other online sources ( Quiroga &amp; Mostafa, 2002 ), often using student samples ( Hofer, 2004; Quiroga &amp; Mostafa, 2002 ). The current study distinguishes itself from research in this area by using think aloud reports to asses both accessibility and quality, focusing on the selection of human infor-mation sources instead of (online) documentary information sources, and doing so in an organizational setting. 3. Method
Think aloud sessions were held with 56 employees (37 men, 19 women) from four governmental organiza-tions (14 per organization) in the Netherlands. The participants came from a wide variety of disciplines and held jobs at varying positions in the organizations. The think aloud sessions were conducted at the partici-pant X  X  work place. In order to establish rapport with the participants, an interview of fifteen minutes took place prior to the session. Subsequently, participants were handed instructions on how to think aloud, along with a test assignment. Afterwards, feedback was provided and the participants were given the actual assign-ment. For this assignment, participants used electronic profiles of co-workers. These profiles were available on the organization X  X  intranet and included information such as contact details, information about the source X  X  knowledge area(s), job position and educational background.

Originally, the study aimed to look at naturally occurring information needs arising from work-related problems. Indeed, fostering social capital is particularly interesting, because of its perceived value for work-related consultation processes (see, e.g., Cross &amp; Borgatti, 2004 ). However, a pre-test of the think aloud study revealed that, despite several reminders to think of information needs before the study took place, none of the participants had done so. Consequently, very general information searches (e.g.,  X  X  X omeone who knows some-thing about organic food X  X ) were performed, more out of curiosity than out of work-related needs. The assign-ment in the actual study was therefore executed on the basis of described hypothetical situations.
Two descriptions of work-related problems were designed in order to prevent the description X  X  specific char-acteristics distorting the findings. The participants randomly received one of these descriptions. In the first description, participants were told that they were a policy-maker in their organization and were part of a knowledge management project that had recently been formed. The first job of the group was to design a knowledge management strategy. For this task, the participant needed to find a source to assist in selecting which elements should be included in such a strategy. In the second description, participants were also told that they were a policymaker in their organization. This policymaker, however, was said to be working on a memorandum that served to position the Dutch government on a certain topic (depending on the policy area for which the different organizations were responsible). For this task, the policymaker needed to find a source that was knowledgeable about the latest developments in the field. The assignments included the exact key words with which participants executed the search on the organization X  X  Intranet. Per organization, partici-pants were thus exposed to the same list of sources.

Participants performed the assignment twice. This choice results from two considerations. First of all, par-ticipants can only use a criterion for source selection if information that is relevant for such a criterion is avail-able. As participants may choose different sources from the total list to evaluate, there is a possibility that certain criteria cannot be used by some participants because information about such criteria is lacking on the chosen sources X  profiles. As such, the resulting pattern of criteria use can be more an artifact of the infor-mation participants are exposed to than reflecting what people find important in a source. To control for this, participants had to evaluate a fixed set of sources per organization (the first 5 X 7 search results) from the total list of sources. The information on the profiles of the fixed set of sources was content analyzed and subse-quently compared between organizations. No significant differences were found. However, this  X  X  X orced X  X  eval-uation may not reflect the naturalistic selection behavior of employees: they may want to evaluate more information sources, or less. To allow participants to make such naturalistic evaluations, the think aloud study was divided into two phases.
 Initially, participants were permitted to check as many sources as they wanted from the total list of sources.
However, in the second phase, all participants had to think aloud while evaluating a fixed set of sources from the total list. To prevent interruptions from changing the course of the decision-making process, participants were asked to report only on their thoughts and not to explain or analyze them ( Ericsson &amp; Simon, 1993 ).
Moreover, after the instructions given in the first and second phase, they were only probed when they stopped verbalizing for some time. In such instances they were reminded to think aloud.

At the conclusion of the think aloud session  X  so as not to interfere with the performance of the task  X  par-ticipants were asked why they had chosen a particular source. As the think aloud method requires participants to simply report what goes through their minds, it is possible that more  X  X  X mpulsive X  X  thoughts (i.e., thoughts that have nothing to do with the source selection process) are also reported. The reported reasons provided an indication whether thoughts were mentioned impulsively or were actual considerations in the source selection process.

The sessions were audiotaped and transcribed. A review of the transcribed verbal protocols yielded 792 incidents in which participants used one or more criteria to evaluate the costs or benefits of using a particular source. The incidents were coded by the researcher and an independent coder, using a fixed coding scheme (see
Table 1) . 1 An initial version of the coding scheme was developed on the basis of a literature study about source selection criteria. Observations during data collection were used to improve the coding scheme. Two new cat-egories were added. First, one for instances in which the relevance of the source X  X  contacts were considered and second, one for when participants considered seemingly irrelevant similarities (i.e., not related to the source selection assignment) between source and participant. The final version of the coding scheme included an  X  X  X ther X  X  category for those segments that did not fit any of the categories in the codebook. This category was only sparingly used, indicating that the scheme included a clear and exhaustive list of factors influencing source selection (see Table 2 ).

The independent coder received an instruction manual on how to use the coding scheme. In a training ses-sion, the coder coded four transcripts (consisting of 82 incidents) and received additional feedback on the use of the coding scheme. To assess intercoder reliability, 28% of the total amount of verbal protocols in the study was coded by both coders. Cohen X  X  kappa scores mainly ranged between .75 and 1.00, indicating that the researcher and the independent coder coded the incidents in a reliable way. The intercoder reliability of  X  X  X rrel-evant similarity X  X  was considerably lower (.66), indicating less, but still substantial agreement ( Landis &amp; Koch, 1977 ). 4. Results
Participants use many different considerations when selecting human information sources. Table 2 provides an overview of the percent of times these individual considerations were expressed among the total mentioned considerations. A distinction is made between the different phases of the think aloud sessions. As explained in the previous section, in the first phase of the session, participants were left free in the number of sources they chose to evaluate, whereas in the second phase, participants evaluated a fixed set of sources.

The results show that the majority of the coded text segments refer to source quality. This includes, above all, considerations about whether the source X  X  knowledge is relevant and, to a lesser extent, reliable. However, the findings suggest that such relevance judgments are more complicated than is often assumed in research into the role of accessibility versus quality in organizational source selection. As numerous studies in the wider field of information retrieval have argued before, there are different types of relevance. Quite a number of studies address the multidimensional nature of relevance (see, e.g., Borlund, 2003; Mizarro, 1997; Park, 1994; Sarac-evic, 1996, 1999; Schamber, 1994 ). The results of the present study are in line with such discussions. Even when acknowledging a match between the topic of the source X  X  knowledge and the task for which information is sought ( topic of knowledge ), participants sometimes perceive a source to be irrelevant in another way. Employ-ees, for example, also consider whether such a source is expected to take a pragmatic or conceptual perspective towards the task, or from which professional discipline the source is expected to approach the task ( perspec-tive ). Their beliefs about the value of such predicted perspectives for their specific task subsequently play a role in their decision whether or not to select a source.

As this study finds, considerations about the source X  X  perspective are regularly expressed when making a selection. However, a significant difference is found in the frequency with which  X  X  X erspective X  X  is expressed between the two phases of the think aloud session ( v 2 = 9.51, df = 1, p = .00); Participants have a tendency to pay more attention to it when evaluating the fixed set of sources than when they were allowed to check as many sources as they wanted. In circumstances that are more true-to-life, perspective thus seems to be less important.

With regard to accessibility, considerations that are used in the study primarily refer to the physical prox-imity of the source. Apparently, despite the available information and communication technology, physical proximity is still an issue in deciding whether to use a source or not. Another interesting finding is associated with the approachability of sources. Like all other accessibility-related factors, participants rarely express thoughts about a source X  X  approachability in the think aloud sessions. However, the thoughts they do express differ from those in other studies (see, for example, Allen, 1977; Cross &amp; Borgatti, 2004 ). Instead of feeling uncomfortable admitting not knowing something, the participants feel uncomfortable disturbing busy or highly placed sources.

Not all of the mentioned considerations refer to source accessibility or quality. The most important of these non-related considerations is familiarity. 2 Participants often consider whether they are (un)familiar with a source. However, a significant difference is found in the frequency with which  X  X  X amiliarity X  X  is used between the two phases of the think aloud session ( v 2 = 19.45, df = 1, p = .00); When left free to decide which sources to evaluate, this consideration is more frequently expressed than when evaluating a fixed set of sources.
Indeed, in the first phase, participants often choose to mainly evaluate those sources from the list that they are familiar with.

In addition, participants sometimes do not so much evaluate the source itself but the source X  X  contacts. If the source turns out not to hold the expected information, he or she may recommend others that can help.
Moreover, seemingly irrelevant similarities between the source and the information seeker are sometimes expressed, e.g., having studied at the same university. 5. Discussion 5.1. The role of source quality
Social capital X  X  capability to support information exchange between people has inspired numerous IT ini-tiatives to facilitate the use of human information sources within organizations (e.g., directories of expertise, knowledge maps, project information on the company intranet). By making people aware of the existence and location of relevant others, these channels tackle an important barrier to information exchange. However, this is not necessarily sufficient to ensure use ( Adler &amp; Kwon, 2002; Hardy, 1982; Huysman, 2004 ). The challenge remains to encourage people to use these channels and actually exchange information with co-workers.
The study described here finds that the decision to use human information sources primarily depends on perceived source quality. Although this seems an obvious outcome, it has important implications for informa-tion management practitioners. Many information management solutions are initiated by managers. They feel a need to build extensive, rich networks between their employees in order to bring together knowledge that is scattered throughout the organization ( Huysman, 2004 ). This need is often assumed to be shared by the orga-nization X  X  employees ( Adler &amp; Kwon, 2002 ). The findings of this study, however, indicate that employees do not necessarily perceive the benefits of such exchanges.

In order for information exchange to take place, the quality of the available sources should be acknowl-edged. Yet, what is considered to be good quality information relies on the information seeker. The present study shows that even when employees acknowledge a match between the topic of the source X  X  knowledge and the task at hand, information seekers may not perceive the value of a source. This also depends on the source X  X  perceived reliability or the source X  X  predicted perspective towards the task. Information seekers prefer to obtain information from a perspective or frame of reference that they believe is appropriate for the task.
Important opportunities for information exchange may remain unexploited because they are not recognized as such. Instead of building rich and extensive networks of co-workers across the organization, employees may choose to seek out information only from certain thought worlds within the organization or not at all.
To reduce this tendency, and create a better understanding of others X  frames of reference it is important for organizations to help employees appreciate the quality of information from their co-workers. This requires management to foster shared contexts for collective and collaborative action ( Dougherty, 1992 ). From a social capital perspective, this is related to building cognitive social capital ( Nahapiet &amp; Ghoshal, 1998 ). Newell,
Tansley, and Huang (2004) discuss the importance of cognitive social capital for knowledge integration in more detail. Establishing such social capital can be achieved by developing a shared vision (e.g., common goals and concerns) and language (e.g., similar jargon and terminology) within the organization ( Levin, Cross, &amp; Abrams, 2003 ). Johnson and Johnson, for example, established communities of practice around various product areas. At a large pharmaceutical company, employees from the commercial and R&amp;D department were sent through a rotation program in both departments to let these different functional groups find com-mon ground ( Cross, Parker, Prusak, &amp; Borgatti, 2001 ). Finally, common objects (such as documents or pro-cedure manuals) can be used to provide a shared reference point to employees in the organization ( Lesser &amp;
Prusak, 2000 ). This does not mean, however, that knowledge integration is purely a cognitive issue: relational social capital would also play a role here. Dougherty (1992) , for instance, emphasizes the importance of efforts to build a corporate culture, Tansley and Newell (2007) point at the importance of relational knowing (empha-sizing the role of relational processes in knowledge development), and Boland and Tenkasi (1995) note that next to cognitive means, establishing cooperative relations between different communities of practice is also essential in overcoming different thought worlds. 5.2. The think aloud approach
This study aimed to contribute to the methodological development of an emerging line of research by exploring the value of a think aloud approach to human source selection in organizations. The results suggest that this method can offer a detailed understanding of source selection considerations; even for those consid-erations employees do not remember well after the selection has taken place or that are not likely to be expressed in group discussions. The think aloud reports, for example, resulted in a better understanding of considerations regarding relevance and feeling comfortable with a source. Relevance is found to depend on more than the source X  X  topic of knowledge and considerations about the source X  X  approachability rather refer to not wanting to disturb busy sources than worrying about looking stupid asking a source for help (as was found by Allen, 1977 &amp; Cross &amp; Borgatti, 2004 ).

Potential weaknesses of the method can also be identified. First of all, an important limitation is that it can only measure what is conscious and within an individual X  X  ability to verbalize. In the majority of studies that assessed the validity of think aloud reports, this limitation did not play a role (see Crutcher, 1994 ). In addition, before conducting the present study, five think aloud sessions were conducted to assess potential problems.
Employees seemed to be consciously selecting sources and did not report any problems verbalizing their thoughts (other than it taking more time than usual).

Second, the method requires participants to simply report what goes through their minds. As such, the method can also tap into rather impulsive thoughts. For example, participants may be inclined to impulsively report a thought (e.g.,  X  X  X ey, I know this person X  X  or  X  X  X is office is across the hall X  X ), without actually consid-ering this as a selection criterion. To provide some indication for the impulsivity of criteria, participants were asked why they selected a particular source immediately after the think aloud session. Their answers showed a similar use of criteria as was found in the think aloud reports. choice, the respondents no longer mentioned considerations that fall in the category  X  X  X eemingly irrelevant sim-ilarities X  X  (e.g., having studied at the same university or having similar hobbies). These considerations may thus be examples of impulsive reactions. However, it seems that, by and large, the expressed thoughts are serious considerations.

Future studies on the role of accessibility and quality wanting to take a similar approach, should take another limitation of this study into account: the study has assessed source selection using hypothetical situ-ations in an experimental setting. For example, in this study, participants did not actually have to contact the sources. As a result, certain considerations may have been considered less frequently than in more true-to-life settings. Indeed, physical accessibility is slightly less mentioned than in the studies of Fidel and Green (2004) and Hertzum (2002) . However, these authors find the same pattern: quality considerations are more frequently expressed than accessibility considerations.

Moreover, in various interviews about source selection, it was found that worrying about looking incom-petent when asking a source for information is a consideration when selecting sources ( Allen, 1977; Cross &amp;
Borgatti, 2004 ). Yet, this consideration was not mentioned in this study at all. Once again, this finding may be associated with the artificial setting in which participants did not actually have to contact sources. However, other, more naturalistic quantitative studies have found the same result: worries about appearing incompetent do not affect information seekers X  selection of information sources ( Cross &amp; Borgatti, 2004; Xu et al., 2006 ). In addition, other concerns about the source X  X  approachability were indeed expressed in the present study: par-ticipants sometimes felt uncomfortable disturbing busy or highly placed sources.

Of course, it remains to be seen whether the use of these criteria is influenced by specific organizational or situational characteristics, such as the time that is available to seek information or organizational constraints on the use of particular sources ( Bystro  X  m&amp;Ja  X  rvelin, 1995 ). As our focus was much more on the source selec-tion process itself than on such influences, this context was not explicitly studied here. Future studies should therefore aim to include more information about the organizations in which source selection takes place and explore potential organizational differences.

In spite of these limitations, we still feel that the think aloud method as used in this study, with a focus on human information sources as well as on both accessibility and quality, in an organizational setting and with a relatively large number of respondents compared to previous think aloud studies, has provided valid conclu-sions concerning the source selection process. 6. Conclusions
Over the years, IT professionals have focused on creating facilities to obtain information in organizations and thus facilitate knowledge management. However, employees do not always exploit the information sources they have at their disposal. Previous research has identified two important factors used in the decision to use information sources in organizations: accessibility and quality. Their relative importance is, however, subject to debate.

To address these inconsistencies, a new approach to the study of source selection  X  in which the actual use that employees make of aspects of accessibility and quality in selection decisions is studied for different types of information sources  X  is currently developing. This study supports the findings of these new studies: when deciding to use human information sources, employees most frequently utilize quality-related considerations.
Despite contradictory results in past research, this new approach consistently finds the same results. Whereas accessibility was thought to be the dominant influence in source selection based on several prior studies (see, e.g., Gerstberger &amp; Allen, 1968; O X  X eilly, 1982 ), it seems quality is most important now. To provide a further base for such conclusions, future studies should be conducted in different organizational contexts.
Future studies that want to follow this new approach should consider making use of the think aloud method. It seems a promising method to study the role of accessibility versus quality in human source selec-tion, providing a more direct way to assess the role of source selection criteria than the methods that were used so far.
