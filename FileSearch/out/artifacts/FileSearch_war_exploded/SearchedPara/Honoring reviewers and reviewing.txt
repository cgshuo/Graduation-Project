 Peer reviewing is a critical component in the long chain of scholarly communication. When Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society was established in 1665, as one of the first scientific and learned journals and still going strong today, peer reviewing was specified in its charter. The model was followed ever since by any and all scholarly journals. The importance of the process was captured by Ziman (1968, p. 111) 1 :  X  X  X he referee is the lynchpin about which the whole business of science is pivoted. X  X  Times change, technologies change, pub-lication manners change, but the role and importance of reviewers and reviewing remain constant.
Peer reviewing is a hard job, an invisible job, a sacrifice of time in the line of scholarly duty. Yet, it is also a job that is appreciated, respected, and valued. In this issue we honor the reviewers for Information Processing &amp; Management for the period of year and half (October 2004 X  X ay 2006) by listing them. In October 2004, Information Processing &amp; Management started using the Elsevier Editorial System (EES) and these reviewers were a part of the all-electronic submission and review system.

This is not only a public acknowledgement of their contribution but even more so a public expression of thanks.

We are also publishing a note on Reviewer Merits, signed and circulated by Editors-in-Chief of six journals in the area of information science, librarianship and human X  X omputer interaction, encouraging participation in the reviewing process and a greater and more visible recognition of reviewers.


Peer reviewing is a critical component in the long chain of scholarly communication. It is a hard job, an invisible job, a sacrifice of time in the line of scholarly duty. Yet, peer reviewing is also a job that is appreci-ated, respected, and valued.

In this issue we honor the reviewers for Information Processing &amp; Management for the period of a year and a half (June 2006 X  X ecember 2007), by listing them. The last honor list was published in volume 43, issue 1, January 2007, which covered the period for preceding year and a half, from October 2004 to May 2006. Many reviewers appeared on both lists.

This is not only a public acknowledgement of their contribution but even more so a public expression of thanks. Moreover, this is also an encouragement for participation in the reviewing process in the future, for the future of scholarly publishing depends in critical ways on reviewers and peer reviewing.
We also publish this to bolster the process for achieving a greater and more visible recognition of reviewers by their institutions and peers. We hope that critical reviewing will be included in significant ways as part of scholarly productivity assessments.
 There is changing of the guard for this journal. After 22 years and 20 volumes, I am stepping down as the Editor-in-Chief of Information Processing &amp; Management. The new Editor-in-Chief is Prof. Fabio Crestani of University of Lugano, Switzerland. A well recognized scholar, he will lead the journal in the rapidly evolving and exciting future of the areas we cover.

In 1985 (volume 21), when I assumed the editorship from Prof. Bernard Fry of Indiana University (he was the Editor-in-Chief for the preceding 20 years) we published 552 pages, with 34 articles from 57 authors resid-ing in 13 countries. In 2007 (volume 43), we published 1834 pages with 112 articles from 273 authors residing in 26 countries. The growth of the journal is a reflection of the growth of the subjects we cover, information science in general and information retrieval and related areas in particular. The ever widening international spread of authors and reviewers is also a sign of a global interest in these areas. First and foremost, I wish to thank authors and reviewers for their contributions. They were instrumental in the growth and reach of this journal.

Times change, technologies change, publication manners change, even editors change, but the role and importance of reviewers and reviewing remain constant.
