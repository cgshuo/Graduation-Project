 This paper investigates using social tags for the purpose of making personalized content r ecommendations. Our tag-based recommender creates a personalized bookmark recommendation model for each user based on  X  X urrent X  and  X  X eneral interest X  tags, defined by different time intervals.

The goal of this paper is to study the utility of social tags as a new way to recommend personalized content to users. The basic assumption is simple: When users share content and associate tags with that content, it is likely they would be interested in additional content described by similar tags. As such, these tags can be seen as a fraction of a ke yword-based user-interest profile. The more a user tags, the more co mplete the profile gets, and the more effectively it can be used for recommendation purposes. The advantage of using social tags is that they do not require users to create or update their profiles, or to provide explicit feedback [1]. The tag set can be used as a filter for incoming information and can be automatically updated over time by adding users X  recent tags and removing older ones. Haye s et al. [2] used tags for non-personalized blog recommendations. In our work, we focus on using tags from an enterprise social bookmarking system [3] to create personalized bookmark recommendations. We create a personalized tag-based recommender for each user as described in Figure 1. Our reco mmender consists of two Na X ve Bayes classifiers trained over different timeframes: One classifier predicts the user X  X  current interes t; the other classifier predicts the user X  X  general interest in a bookmark. We aggregate both predictions to a final prediction in the following way: If either or both of the two classifiers predict a bookmark as interesting, we recommend the bookmark. If neither classifier predicts the bookmark as interesting, we do not recommend it. The two classifiers are trained with a subset of the bookmarks created by a user. The tags of each bookmark, converted into a  X  X ag of words X , are used as training features. The core idea is to consider recent bookmarks as good implicit user interest indicators. Previous research ha s shown that implicit indicators like bookmarks created by the us er while browsing the web can be as predictive of interest levels as explicit ratings [1]. For both classifiers, more recent bookmarks are treated as positive training samples, i.e. interesting to th e user, whereas older bookmarks are treated as negative training exampl es i.e. less interesting to the user. The general interest classi fier uses bookmarks from a longer time interval as training samples in order to capture general interest topics. The current interest classifier is trained based on a shorter time interval in order to reflect current interests. The data for our experiments were obtained from Dogear, an enterprise social bookmarking site [3 ], similar to del.icio.us. For our analysis, we used 27 months of Dogear data from June 2005 to September 2007. We selected 60 users based on the following criteria: 30 of the users were requi red to have more than 500 tags. We call this group high taggers . The remaining 30 users were selected to have more than 200 but less than 500 tags. This group is called low taggers . We trained and tested classifiers for each user with different sets of bookmarks based on different time intervals for the positive and negative samples, using 75% of the bookmarks for training and 25% for testing. The percentage of test bookmarks correctly identif ied as positive and negative is used as the performance measure for evaluating the classifier. We conducted an initial experiment in which we trained the current interest classifier with di fferent time intervals for all users. The results were generally low and only marginally better than the random classifier, which can be considered as a baseline with 50% accuracy. A closer look at the training data revealed tags that were common to both positive and negative samples. These tags were regularly used by the user. As such they likely represent a more general interest in these topi cs as opposed to more current or immediate interests. The presence of these general interest tags in both positive and negative training samples prevented the classifier from differentiating more clearly between the two classes. To get better prediction results for the current interest classifier, we removed tags that are us ed more frequently over longer periods of time from the negative and positive training data. In order to determine which tags to remove, we conducted an experiment in which we computed the average accuracy by removing tags with different mont hly counts. Results showed that removing tags that are repetitively used in 6 or more months yields the highest accuracy for high taggers Due to the small tag data set for low taggers, removi ng frequently occurring tags did not yield better results. In order to find the best training interval for the current interest cla ssifier, we conducted another experiment in which we varied the length of the training periods between 1 and 8 weeks. The best combined average accuracy for high and low taggers was achieved with a 4-week training period. In order to accurately predict if a bookmark is interesting, we also need to take general interest tags into account. To find a good approximation for the training inte rval for the general interest classifier, we varied the interval between 3 and 9 months. The highest combined average accuracy for high and low taggers was achieved with a training interval of about 6 months. The training periods describe d above yield good results on average. However, we cannot assume that an interest lasts exactly some fixed number of days. To more accurately model the true duration of current and general inte rests, we used flexible labeling where we moved training samples to the positive or negative training set, respectively, based on which set they occurred more prominently in. Experimental results for the current interest classifier show that the total av erage accuracy can be improved by 4.2% for high taggers and 2.6% for low taggers. Finally, the predictions made by the current and general interest classifiers are combined. If either or both of the classifiers predict a bookmark as interesting, then the bookmark is predicted to be interesting as shown in the decision matrix in Figure 1. For realistic testing, we used the test dataset from the current interest classifier including bookmarks tagge d with general interest tags. The overall accuracy for our recommender was 80.2% for high taggers and 74.9% for low taggers. In addition to the offline experi ments, we conducted a user study to assess how well our recommender system would work in a real world situation. We recommended bookmarks to a user that were created by other users. 40 high and low taggers participated in the survey which contained 30 bookmarks created by other Dogear users. The recommender predicted 15 of them as interesting and the rest as not interesting to the user. The users were unaware of the recommender predictions and were asked to rate the bookmarks as interesting or not interesting to them. The average accuracy of the user ratings was calculated by comparing the user ratings with the predictions of the tag-based recommender for those 30 bookmarks. We compared the user study results with the results of the offline experiments as shown in Table 1. The user study results show that the tag-based recommender performs well with real data. Our users mostly agreed with the decisions made, i.e. 70.4% of the high tagger bookmarks and 64.4% of the low tagger bookmarks were either properly selected as interesting or not interesting. The analyses presented in this paper support that the tagging behaviour of a user can be leveraged to make effective personalized bookmark recommendations. Time is a critical component when building such a recommender system. We were able to achieve higher prediction accuracy by modelling different time frames for current and general interest tags.
