 Current biomedical research is characterized by immense volumes of data, ac-companied by a tremendous increase in the number of b iomedical related publi-cations. In order to provide biologists a more effective and more accurate way to access biomedical lit erature datasets, this paper e xplores an integrated approach to bring linkage information into biomedical retrieval. We utilize information in REFERENCES sections to generate a citation graph, which can be seen as a network defined by content relevant or content similarity. Three linkage-based ranking algorithms, InDegree, PageRank and HITS, are applied to the citation graph to calculate linkage-based ranking scores for documents in the dataset. On the other hand, content-based topic-r elevant ranking scores come from the probability model based Okapi IR system, which ranks documents according to their topic-relevant probabilities. Finally, two different combination methods are used to integrate linkage-based information with content-based information. In our experiments, significant perform ance improvements can be obtained by using the integrated approach. It is worth noting that the approach we intro-duced achieves the best document-base d MAP among all results that have been reported so far.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3 introduces the integra ted approach which combines content-based IR results from a probability model based IR system with linkage-based ranking scores from a citation graph to improve biomedical literature retrieval performance. Our experimental results followed by analysis and discussion are presented in Section 4. Conclusions of this paper are presented in Section 5. The idea of using link analysis to improve the effectiveness of a information re-trieval system was proposed in 1998 [1][2]. A recent research by Borodin et al. [3] was based on 34 queries and 200 webpages retrieved by the Google search engine for each query. Linkage-based ranking scores calculated by link analysis ranking algorithms were combined with Google X  X  retrieval results. Surprisingly, some rel-ative simpler link analysis ranking algorithms outperformed more sophisticated algorithms [3]. Najork et al. [4] evaluated the effectiveness of link analysis rank-ing algorithms based on a webpage dataset containing 463 million webpages and 28,043 queries. Their experimental results show that utilize linkage information can improve ranking results from a content-based IR system, and HITS algo-rithm is about as effective as webpage InDegree algorithm. Another research in biomedical literature retrieval which is more similar to our work was done by Lin [5]. This research focused on searchin g on biomedical literature abstracts, in the context of the PubMed search engine. In this research, PageRank and HITS were used to calculate linkage-based ranking scores on the abstract network pro-vided by the PubMed search engine. The traditional linear combination method was used to combine the linkage-based ranking scores with retrieval results from Terrier information retrieval platform on TREC 2005 Genomics dataset.
Instead of using hyperlinks or content similarity links provided by a third part search engine, linkage information we used are extracted from a citation graph, which is generated from REFERENCES sections in TREC 2007 Ge-nomics dataset. We find that a simpler link analysis algorithm is more suitable for biomedical literature retrieval than well-known PageRank and HITS. The integrated information retrieval system we introduced consists of two com-ponents, which are content-based information retrieval component and linkage-based ranking score generator.

The content-based IR component is the state-of-the-art probability model based Okapi IR system [6][7], which retri eves topic-relevant documents from the dataset. Its output is a ranked list of 1000 most relevant documents for each topic according to their relevance scores. The linkage-based ranking score generator aims to calculate importance scores for retrieved documents by applying a linkage ranking algorithm to the citation graph. Normalized scores from two components are combined to calculate new ranki ng scores for retrieved documents. 3.1 Content-Based Approach We use Okapi Basic Search System as the content-based IR component. Okapi is an information retrieval system based on the probability model of Robertson and Sparck Jones [8]. Retrieved documents from Okapi are ranked in the order of their probabilities of relevance to the query. Search term is assigned weight basedonitswithin-documenttermfre quency and query term frequency. The weighting function used is BM25 [6]. where N is the number of indexed documents in the collection, n is the number of documents containing a special term, R is the number of documents known to be relevant to a special topic, r is the number of relevant documents containing the term, tf is within-document term frequency, qtf is within-query term fre-quency, dl is the length of the document, avdl is the average document length, nq is the number of query terms, the k i s are tuning constants (which depend on the database and possibly on the nature of the queries and are empirically determined), K equals to k 1  X  ((1  X  b )+ b  X  dl/avdl )and  X  indicates that its following component is added only once per document.

In our experiments, the values of k 2 and k 3 in BM25 function are set to be 0 and 8 respectively. k 1 and b are set to two groups of values. More details will be showninSection4. 3.2 Linkage-Based Approach Citation Graph Construction. For 36 official topics in TREC 2007 Genomics track, Okapi provides 36 ranked documents lists. For each topic, after removing duplicate documents in corresponding list, we get a document set called Root Set . Then the Root Set is augmented by documents that cite documents in Root Set and cited by documents in Root Set, to obtain a larger Base Set .
Given a Base Set, a citation graph can b e constructed. A node is created for every document in Base Set, and a directed edge is placed between two nodes if there is a citation relationship between two documents. Link Analysis ranking algorithms. We utilize three different algorithms to calculate linkage ranking scores on t he citation graph, they are InDegree, PageRank and HITS.
 InDegree. is a simple node importance ranking algorithm, which rank docu-ments according to their popularities [3]. The popularity of a document is defined as the number of documents cited it. InDegree is a simple algorithm which can be viewed as a predecessor of all link analysis ranking algorithms. PageRank. extended InDegree algorithm, which considers links between nodes with different weights, proposed by Brin and Page in 1998. The PageRank al-gorithm performs a random walk on the graph that simulates the behavior of a  X  X andom surfer X . The surfer starts from some nodes chosen according to a distribution D . Page et al. define the PageRank of a webpage A as: where PR ( T i ) denotes the PageRank of document T i which cites document A in our experiments. C ( T i ) means the number of references in document T i .And d  X  [0 , 1] is a damping factor which is usually set to 0.85 [9].
 HITS. introduced by Kleinberg [10], is a more refined algorithm for calculat-ing the importance of webpages. The importance of a webpage is decided by two attributes, namely hub attribute and authority attribute. The hub attribute cap-tures the quality of the page as a pointer to useful resources, while the authority attribute captures the quality of the page as a resource itself. HITS computes two vectors of scores, which defined by Kleinberg (1999) as: where A in our experiments is the adjacency matrix of the citation graph, A ij =1 if document i refers to document j ,otherwise, A ij =0; where i th element denotes the authority score of document i ; while vector contains the hub scores of documents. 3.3 Integration Many previous research studies used the traditional linear combination method to combine content-based information with linkage-based information [3][5]. The traditional linear combination is defined as: where Score combine denotes combination score; NScore content denotes normal-ized content-based score; NScore linkage denotes normalized linkage-based score; and  X   X  [0 , 1] is the combination parameter which denotes the weight of content-based score in combination. In our experiments, score normalization method we used is 0-1 normalization.

Some research has demonstrated that link analysis ranking algorithms may promote documents which are irrelevant to topic [3]. So we introduce a modified linear combination method, which takes a document X  X  topic-relevant rank into account. Formally, we define the modified linear combination method as: where rank content is the rank of a document in content-based IR result. From equation (6) we can see that a document X  X  linkage-based score will be suppressed if it is believed to be irrelevant to the query, since the larger the document X  X  content-based rank is the more irrelevant it is believed. 4.1 Dataset and Evaluation Measures The dataset used in our experiments is TREC 2007 Genomics dataset, which is a full-text biomedical corpus consisting of 162,259 documents from 49 genomics-related journals. Documents in this dataset are in HTML format, and can be identified by their PMIDs [11]. 36 topics from TREC 2007 Genomics track are used as queries.

In our experiments, we use document -based Mean Average Precision (MAP) as the evaluation measure, since the linkage-based ranking scores are calculated based on a document-level citation gr aph. Moreover, document-based MAP is the most widely recognized measure in information retrieval. The definition of document-based MAP can be found in [11]. 4.2 Experimental Results and Analyses In this section,  X  X kapi X  means the conte nt-based Okapi IR system,  X  X nDegree X ,  X  X ageRank X  and  X  X ITS X  denote three integrated IR systems using InDegree, PageRank and HITS as their linkage-based ranking algorithm respectively. Influence of different ranking algorithms. Figures 1 shows evaluation re-sults on document-based MAP with different  X  values. We can see that PageRank outperforms HITS over all  X  values. This makes sense, since a node (document) in a citation graph can be a good authority when many documents cite it, but it usually is not a good hub at the same time, because of the time span limitation of Genomics dataset. However, the philosophy of PageRank algorithm is differ-ent, which only concerns about authority. Thus, PageRank is more suitable for our experiments. InDegree algorithm, b ecause of its simplicity, we expected to set it as a bar to other algorithms. Surprisingly, InDegree outperforms all other algorithms over every  X  value. This may lies in that the structure of biomedi-cal literature citation graph is different from the WWW hyperlink graph. The connectivity of a citation graph is not depends on some key articles [12], which results in a simpler algorithm, InDegree, suits for biomedical literature retrieval more. The time complexity of InDegree algorithm is much less than PageRank and HITS. Its time complexity increases linearly with the growing of the graph. Influence of different combination methods. Two different linear combi-nation methods are used in our experiments. Figure 2(a) shows document-based MAP values of the integrated IR system using the modified linear combination method with different  X  values. The comparison of the effect of combination methods is shown in Figure 2(b). InDegree*, PageRank* and HITS* mean the integrated systems using the traditional linear combination method and apply-ing corresponding link analysis algorithm.

Tuning involves an exploration of  X  from 0 in steps of 0.02. From Figure 2(a) we can see that InDegree and PageRank can bring the maximum positive in-fluences to the content-based IR syst em when the weight assigned to linkage component is 0.35 and 0.3 respectivel y. HITS is more likely to promote topic-irrelevant documents, only when the weight assigned to linkage-based ranking scores from HITS is less than 0.2, it can slightly improve the content-based re-trieval result. Figure 2(b) shows that the modified linear combination method can achieve a better document-based MAP than the traditional linear combi-nation method by suppressing linkage-based ranking scores of the documents which are believed to be less relevant.
 Performance on different baseline runs. In order to find out wheather our integrated approach can also make performance improvements on other content-based IR runs, we combine linkage-based ranking scores with five dif-ferent content-based IR runs. We built different indices and set different BM25 parameters to get different content-based IR results. In Table 1, Okapi 1 and Okapi 2 are the content-based Okapi runs which set BM25 parameters k 1 =0 . 5 and b =1 . 3, using word-based index and sentence-based index respectively. Okapi 3 , Okapi 4 and Okapi 5 are content-based Okapi runs which all set BM25 parameters k 1 =2and b =0 . 4, using paragraph-based index, sentence-based index and word-based index respectiv ely. These parameter settings have been tested on many datasets in different domains, which results in good perfor-mances [6][7].

Note that Okapi 4 achieves the best document-based MAP among results that have been reported so far. Although Okapi 3 isnotasgoodasthebestrun reported in TREC 2007 Genomics Track in terms of document-based MAP, it outperforms the best run reported in TREC 2007 Genomics Track on document-based MAP [11] after integrating linkage information into it.
 Table 1 shows document-based MAP and Passage-based MAP [11] when using InDegree algorithm in the integrated approach. We can see that among three link analysis ranking algorithms, InDegree algorithm still performs best. our integrated approach can make improvements on different IR runs, no matter whether the baseline run is strong or weak. For the IR baseline run that achieves the best document-based MAP in TREC 2007 [11], the integrated approach still makes 5.3% improvement on document-based MAP and 5.1% improvement on Passage-based MAP. Overall, the integrated approach achieves up to 11.5% improvement on Doucment-based MAP and 14.8% improvement on Passage-based MAP. In this paper, we propose an integrate d approach to improve the effectiveness of biomedical literature retrieval, which combines content-based topic-relevant ranking scores with linkage-based ranking scores. The linkage-based ranking scores are calculated on a citation graph generated from REFERENCES section of documents in TREC 2007 Genomics dataset. On the other hand, content-based topic-relevant ranking scores are provided by the probability model based Okapi IR system. Based on the experimental results, we find that integrating linkage-based ranking scores calculated from the citation graph into content-based ranking scores can improve performances of biomedical literature retrieval. Moreover, the integrated approach makes improvements on all randomly chosen IR baselines in our experiments. The pe rformance of an integrated IR system can be affected by link analysis ranking algorithms and combination methods. We also find that a simpler linkage-based ranking algorithm, InDegree, is more suitable for biomedical literature retrieval than some sophisticated algorithms. The integrated approach can be extended to o ther information r etrieval domains easily, as long as citation relationships among documents can be obtained.
