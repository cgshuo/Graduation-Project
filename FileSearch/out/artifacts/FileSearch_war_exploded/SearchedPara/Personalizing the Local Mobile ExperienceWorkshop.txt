 Mobile, local recommendations are on the rise. Surprisingly however, research addressing user perceptions of local rec-ommendations and local di ff erences when interacting with such recommendation services is yet scarce. Location-based recommendation services are mostly evaluated from a  X  X ec-ommendation systems X  standpoint, with limited experiential insights from users and limited focus on local di ff erences that may apply. This workshop focuses on the local, personal user experience, and provides a forum to exchange experiences, insights and strategies in personalizing local mobile appli-cations and generating local recommendations that fit local user needs.

The rise of location-enabled mobile phones and location based services o ff ers a great opportunity to apply person-alization and recommender system technology to people X  X  everyday lives. Location-based services are increasingly pop-ular and used by millions of people around the globe. The millions of local data points generated by these users o ff er great opportunities for generating local recommendations. Local adaptation of adverts, search results, and recommen-dations of local places, things (and even nearby people) are now standard practice across many commercial services (e.g. Google search, Foursquare recommendations, Tripadvisor, Yelp etc.).

A variety of digital traces (to name a few: venue/event check-ins and ratings, GPS and GSM traces, transport records, and geo-located photographs) can be used to infer how peo-ple move about their city and extract their context and habits. Personalization and recommender systems, poten-tially merged with the data that people store online (e.g., social networks, web ratings), can then not only be used to recommend new places and events that they may find inter-esting to attend, but, more broadly, personalize and enhance any service that people find themselves using.

Surprisingly however, the amount of research addressing and understanding user perceptions of local recommenda-tions and local di ff erences when interacting with such rec-ommendation services is yet scarce. The vast majority of location-based recommendation services have been evalu-ated from a  X  X ecommendation systems X  standpoint, with lim-ited subjective insights from users of such systems and lim-ited focus on any local or cultural di ff erences that may apply.
The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for re-searchers and developers from both academia and industry to exchange experiences, insights and strategies in: (1) per-sonalizing local mobile applications, and (2) generating local recommendations that fit local user needs. We aim to gen-erate an overview of local considerations that can be applied by both researchers and practitioners in their work, to spur on future research.
This workshop focuses on the user and their mobile expe-riences when encountering location-based and personalized recommendations. Designing great user experiences requires a deeper understanding of the information needs, behaviors and underlying motivations of users. As such there are a number of research challenges and open research questions that that arise. For example:
Our research questions span a variety of fields: pervasive and persuasive technology, smart city/ubiquitous systems, personalization and recommender systems, mobile comput-ing, location-based services, design, social networking, user experience and human-computer interaction. This work-shop aims to: (1) build a community of researchers working within this space, who are currently spread across many re-search fields, such as HCI, Design, Mobile Computing, In-formation Retrieval, Recommender Systems and Personal-ization; (2) to promote RecSys as a compelling venue for all kinds of mobile Web related research; and (3) to set an agenda for future research in this important area.
Our goal is to provide a forum for researchers and devel-opers from both academia and industry to exchange experi-ences, insights and strategies in generating local and person-alized mobile recommendations that fit local needs. Themes of interest include (but are not limited to):
This RecSys 2012 workshop explores local mobile experi-ences from two directions and this is reflected in our work program (See Table 1). The workshop features contributions from designers, developers and researchers from both indus-try and academia. Beyond a set of position pitches from our participants, this workshop will provide a practical in-sight in the local experience when encountering personalized recommendations.

We X  X l spend half a day exploring Dublin using local rec-ommender systems, on-the-spot. We X  X l be using commercial systems, and any services that participants themselves may have built -and we X  X l explore what X  X  great, what X  X  missing, and where our research should be heading. The expected outcome is an overview of the challenges in generating local recommendations and strategies for overcoming them, and generating new insights in the factors that influence the local user experience when interacting with local personalization.
