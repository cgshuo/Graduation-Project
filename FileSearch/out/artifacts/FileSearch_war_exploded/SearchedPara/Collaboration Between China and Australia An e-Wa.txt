 Sustainable management of water resources is one of the greatest challenges facing soci-ety in the twenty-first century. The ever-incr easing population together with an increasing urbanization place around one third of the population in the world under pressure for ad-equate drinking water supply. Australia and China have both identified water resources management issues as a priority research area where there are significant ongoing R&amp;D activities. Both countries have supported exten sive national collaborative efforts to en-able the future deployment of large scale water resources management systems.
Water resource management is a highly complex problem, involving continuous monitoring of state of water (which incl udes quality and usage in waterways, under-ground and ocean), modelling of catchment proce ss, river/riparian rehabilitation, envi-ronmental flow assessment, urban and rural water reuse, groundwater contamination, drinking water supply, farming and industry water usage and trading, water treatment, water sensitive urban design, and assessmen t of ecosystem and human health. Water re-sources management also requires access to met eorological data, and spatial data such as digital elevation, land use and remote sensing data. Current approaches to water re-sources management, for the most part, opera te independently whilst generally working towards the same objectives (for example, improved water quality in waterways in a re-gion). While each of these activities has been effective in their own right, there are major benefits and synergies to be gained through a c oordinated integration of these tasks. The whole-of-water-cycle approach to water resources management aims at establishing a framework for the integration of all data and modelling services related to water re-sources management for a region, including field monitoring with its associated spatial, temporal trend analysis, remote sensing ( including satellite and autonomous stations), and predictive modelling to facilitate and support management decisions.
 ICT infrastructure is vital to the success of t he whole-of-water-cycle approach. The Australian Research Council (ARC), through one of its funded research network pro-grammes, ARC Research Network in Enterprise Information Infrastructure, and the National Natural Science Foundation China (NSFC) convened a workshop to explore the ICT dimensions of the whole-of-water-cycle approach, and to formulate findings and recommendation for further consideration by the ARC and the NSFC respectively. Before the workshop, a list of possible topics for discussion was sent to each participant so that each could consider them before attending the workshop.

The workshop was held at the Radisson Resort, Gold Coast, Australia, on 4-5 July, 2005. It was attended by a small group of invited computer scientists, mathematicians, water resources experts and government officials with the responsibility of water re-sources management from Australia and China.

The participants identified that sharing of data is an important first step towards closer collaboration. There are three possible sets of data which may be shared: one from South East Queensland Healthy Waterways Partnership, and two from China; one on the Yellow River, and the other one on the Erdos Basin groundwater studies. When the details of the data sets collected were listed side by side it was immediately obvious to the participants that they have much in common. However, it was also clear to the participants what information is lacking in some of the data sets. The participants all showed a willingness to share their collected data sets, even though some of them are not currently available to or assessable by the public. These three data sets contain large amount of data collected over the years 1 . These include: land use data (soil types and composition, vegetable cover, total nitrate contents, total phosphate contents, erosion, riparian conditions), monitoring data (tem perature, conductivity, flow data), groundwa-ter measurements, meteorological data (eva poration), receiving water conditions, man-agement actions (flood management, point source discharges, storm water quality), and a number of models (catchment model, water quality model, groundwater flow model).
There were then some discussions on how assessable the data is to the public. For the South East Queensland Healthy Waterways Partnership, the entire data set is  X  X o-tentially X  available to the public. However, some of the data is not yet online, and it may take some considerable effort to make them generally available online. Secondly, it appears that some of the data do not have descriptions associated with the data set 2 . Hence in order for the data to be generally usable, it is necessary for it to be labelled, described 3 , and curated, so that they may be easily used in modelling studies. Both the Yellow River data and the Erdos Basin groundwater data sets are not normally available to the public. However, the Chinese delegates indicated that they would be willing to make them available to the researchers in the proposed collaboration.

It was found that there are already a number of models 4 built which are applied to these data sets respectively to provide predictions, and guidance for policy formulation and development. However, it was clear that these models are only applicable to their respective region for which they were designed. In other words, in the building of the models, specific knowledge of the region, e.g., soil types, are implicitly incorporated. While this may produce highly effective models, it was suggested that it may be useful to isolate their  X  X egion specific X  aspects, and to instead build generic models with the region specific features included as  X  X lug-in X  modules. In other words, by building generic models with plug-in modules to customise them for particular regions, it is possible to isolate where the models can be further improved. It will also make the models more generally useful as region specific features may be added, leading to their wider coverage and produce higher impact in advanced water resources management. This will make it possible to apply the models to other regions currently not considered in the original model building process.

One way to evaluate such a utility as a generalised modular water resources manage-ment system is to apply the Australian data to the Chinese models, and vice versa. If this can be performed, then it may be possible to isolate the region-specific features in the models. For this to be possible, all data s ets need to be  X  X emotely accessible X  and  X  X n-derstandable X  to the models. The data access i ssue can be handled by a  X  X tandardisation X  process, in that where applicable, a  X  X ranslation X  of the data set coded using one particu-lar  X  X ntology X  can be transformed from one format to another. As the models were built independently, the way in which they accept i nput data may be different. Secondly as in-dicated previously in the building of the models no conscious effort was paid to what is considered as  X  X eneric X  and what is  X  X egion s pecific X . Hence, considerable work would be necessary to isolate the generic and region specific aspects in the current set of models.
The Yellow River data currently pertains only to the waterways,  X  the catchment data is as yet unavailable (it would be available later in 2005). On the other hand, the South East Queensland waterways data contains bot h catchment, waterways, and estuary data. Hence, if it is possible to provide generic models together with region specific plug-in modules, it is possible to apply the Queensland data to the Chinese models, thus it may be possible to provide some indications of what types of data, and where it might be useful to place sensors for possible catchment studies in the upper Yellow River region 5 .

On the other hand, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission has much experience dealing with sediment issues. If the models can be transferred it may be possible to apply the Yellow River sediment models to the Queensland situation, and hence provide some guidance on management policies.

Based on these discussions, it is clear that there are the following stages in a collab-orative research programme: Stage 1 Data integration: the problem of how the existing data may be integrated will Stage 2 Data accessibility: issues of how data can be made accessible remotely and Stage 3 Binding of models: application of various models to different sets of data can The centrality of ICT expertise 6 to the proposed collaborative research programme and the distinction between what is proposed and other existing research programmes are then obvious. These include:
It is only since the advent of the intern et which makes remote access to data and software application possible. This will ma ke it easier for water resources researchers to collaborate even though they are located in geographically separated regions.
It is since the advent of web services standa rdisation process, an d more specifically grid services standardisation in recent years t hat it is possible to provide  X  X rusted X  and  X  X ontrolled access X  to data by remote users. It will also facilitate data to be  X  X ublished X  and  X  X iscovered X  using standardized protocols. This will make it simpler for water re-sources researchers to collaborate, as data can be accessed remotely and securely.
The advances in semantic web technology, and more particularly, in semantic grid studies, that make the importance of ontology and metadata in collaborative research clear. The building of ontology and metadat a, which is vital to collaborative research and usability of the data collected, cannot be undertaken by ICT researchers alone. It must be undertaken through close collaboration between ICT experts and water re-sources experts.

The advances in data fusion, and data visualisation will facilitate the data integration process, as well as their interpretation. This cannot be undertaken by ICT experts alone. It must be undertaken through a close collaboration between ICT and water resources experts so that novel visualisation of data might lead to deeper insights into the nature of the underlying dynamical behaviour of the water resources system from the data collected and hence provide a way for th e explanation of the observed phenomena.
While the separation of gener ic and regions specific aspects of models built so far can be undertaken by water resources experts alone, this process may benefit from a more  X  X ystematic X  approach which ICT and mathematical experts may bring from their ex-perience of building general dynamical models and run them efficiently over distributed computational and data resources.

One may ask: why do we need to go to such an extent to create an IT architecture for collaboration between water resources researchers in the two countries. Would it not be easier and simpler for, say, Australian water resources experts to download the entire data set from China, or vice versa, and obtain the desired results as may be carried out in other collaborative approaches between water resources researchers in the two countries. No doubt this can be performed in isolated circumstances. However, this approach suffers from the following:  X  This methodology is not sustainable. Every time new data is obtained, manual  X  X ata  X  It may not lead to close collaboration between the two groups of water resources  X  The approach cannot be  X  X xported X  elsewhere. As it is a  X  X ustomised X  approach,
Based on these reasons, the proposed approach may usher in a novel approach in which close collaboration between groups of re searchers in multi-di sciplinary research in different countries may be performed. Such close collaboration can be achieved and facilitated by advances in ICT and by a desire of researchers in both China and Australia to collaborate in sharing experience and expertise in tackling an issue which is of vital importance to both countries. The expected outcomes of this collaborat ive research programme are as follows:  X  Three sets of data which can be shared by the participants of the research pro- X  These three sets of data will be properl y annotated, and accessible using agreed  X  A number of water resources models, with clearly understood and identified generic  X  Predictive analysis.

There are many ways to organise the collaborations, through government and non-government sources. The governance structure follows the way in which funding sources will be obtained. But in principle, the governance structure of the project will be: oversight by the funding sources, and adequate reporting of the outcomes arising from the collaborative research. In this paper, we report on a recent workshop to explore the possibility of collaboration between Australia based and China based researchers in the area of whole of cycle wa-ter resources. It is suggested that a fruitful area of collaboration would be to make data resources from both countries available to the collaborators, and to provide some  X  X hat-if X  experiments with those data resources. Through consideration of such  X  X hat-if X  ex-periments, it is clear that how advanced ICT infrastructure will enable and facilitate the collaborative efforts between researchers in both countries. Such collaborations based on advanced ICT infrastructure will facilitate researchers to make the best use of currently collected data, and to provide some predictive analysis of the models developed.
