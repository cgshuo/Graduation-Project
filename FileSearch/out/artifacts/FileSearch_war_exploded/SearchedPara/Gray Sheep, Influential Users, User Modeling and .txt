 This proposed thesis work explores two research areas in the domain of Recommender Systems [RS] , algorithms and their real world applications. First is related to identification of Gray Sheep [GS] users and Influential Users [IU] in any system using different personality models and also creating psychographic profile of such users. The second part of this work is an empirical study to find out the determinant of RS adoption in Start-ups context of developing nations, by using diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory and Technology  X  Organization-Environment (TOE) frameworks. Gray Sheep Problem; Social Network Analysis; Big Five; Basic Human Values; Human Needs; User Modeling; Recommender System; Collaborative Filtering ; Diffusion of Innovation; Technology  X  Organization-Environment framework ; Startups Since the past one and a half decade, there has been tremendous rise in the number of studies related to the realm of RS . Recurrent reports on how some of the most successful commercial organizations of the world like Amazon, Google and Netflix etc. have effectively used RS to boost their efficiency , has made RS a popular constituent of IT and digital marketing strategy . However the focus of academic community still continues to be primarily on increasing the prediction efficiency of the algorithms used by RS, as compared to the user experience and RS acceptance issues. The algorithms too usually focuses on entire system as a whole and relatively lesser attention has been paid in identifying and creating psychographic profiles of special category of users like GS and IU. To the best of our knowledge this thesis explores in a novel way both of the above mentioned dimensions of RS and the findings of this work will have both academic and managerial implications in designing and implementing of RS algorithms and digital marketing strategies. present the existing work done in the area of GS and IU and then in 2.2 we showcase our proposed model along with result of some preliminary empirical work. In section 3.1 we present different theories and framework used in adoption of new technologies in Indian context. In section 3.2 we present our proposed hypothesis and methodology followed by conclusion in section 4 and references in section 5. The traditional Collaborative Filtering algorithm does not work that there exist two kinds of users in the system, White Sheep [WS] and GS. WS are those users who have high correlation value with many other users and GS are the users who partially agree/disagree with other users and have low correlation coefficient with almost all users [2][3]. While these GS users themselves do not benefit much from the system but their presence also diminishes the quality of the recommendations made to the rest of the users in the system [2]. To Identify the GS users in system, clustering based approaches [2][4] or social network approach [5] , has been suggested. In the context of RS , influence is defined as the amount of effect a user has over others via the predictions they receive [6] . Looking from social network perspective social network, there might be a set of users who help a large number of other users to receive recommendations. These users are known as most influential users [6] [7] . One way to observe this effect is to exclude a user and measure the net changes in predictions caused by the removal. This formed the base of algorithm independent approach to find IU [6].Identification of IU is important to prevent shilling attack on RS [8] and also in promotional campaigns [9] However, as all the previously mentioned approaches to find GS and IU uses only the ratings (which are usually sparse) given by the users, to measure the similarity between the users, they are unable to capture the entire difference in taste and preferences of users. Relying solely on ratings ignores the implicit tastes of each user that gets reflected in the reviews and opinion, and ignoring this rich source of information is a major shortcoming of existing work on RS [10]. As user X  X  taste and preferences is manifestation of their personality [11], in order to more effectively identify the different kind of users based on their taste and preferences, we propose the usage of the psychographic constructs based user models to specifically identify these GS and IU . We have chosen three frameworks from psychology, marketing and Information science literature -Cos ta and Norman X  X  Five Factor Model (Big Five) [12][11], Schwartz's Basic Human Values [13][14] and Human Needs Model based on Kotler's and Ford's work in marketing [15]. Big Five model describes how a person engages with the world through these five factors  X  Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism [12]. Basic human Values are  X  desirable, transsituational goals, varying in importance, that serve as guiding principles in people's lives  X  and Conservation, Openness to change, Hedonism, Self Enhancement, Self-transcendence [13][14] . Human Needs are characterized by these twelve categories which describes at a high level what aspect of a product are likely to resonate with the person -Excitement, Harmony, Curiosity, Ideal, Closeness, Self-expression, Liberty, Love, Practicality, Stability, Challenge, and Structure [15]. As part of preliminary study we have verified our proposed model to identify GS users. We used the Amazon movie reviews data set which has been shared at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection as part of Stanford Network Analysis Platform experimental purpose we have extracted the reviews for top 1000 90%. formatting tags and junk characters. Then user modeling services of IBM Watson personality insight service was used by creating a IBM X  X  cloud based solution bluemix X  X  instance to extract the values of each parameters of the three personality frameworks. To extract the Big Five personality characteristic ,Basic Human Value dimensions and Human Needs Model parameters, Watson uses the latest work done in the area of linguistic analytics [17][18][19]. We used SNA approach to find threshold for GS identification so as to benchmark it with existing work [5] and results have been encouraging for Big Five and Basic Human Values as shown in Fig 1(a) and (b). and for GS too on other data sets from different product domains and at different sparsity levels. Constructs of these different models can also be combined together to see if they collectively perform better to identify GS and IU. Apart from merely using an iterative process to find the optimum threshold for GS and IU identification, for each product domain we also intend to do an in-depth study to explore if there are certain common psychological characteristics that increases the likelihood of users becoming a GS or IU in the systems through clustering based on those user models. In further works, we also intend to explore if behavior of GS and IU remains consistent across Cross Domain RS and Context Aware RS systems or not. One more experiment that we propose to do is to explore if for content based algorithms too, rest of the conditions remaining same, does there exist some users for whom the algorithm consistently works poor. If yes, then are there any specific psychographic profiles of such users too. Most of the work elucidating the success of RS adoption in business world covers mostly big organizations like Amazon , Google or Netflix etc. from developed economies [20] [21] . While there have been some studies on RS adoption in developing economies [22] but that too has focused on big retail chains and financial institution. Some of the commonly used model used to study adoption of new and emerging technologies in scholarly research literature are technology acceptance model ( TAM ) [23] [24], theory of planned behavior (TPB) [25] , decomposed theory of planned behavior (DTPB) unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) [26], diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory [27],Technology  X  organization-environment ( TOE ) framework [28]. TAM, DTPB and UTAUT models primarily pertain to measurement individual X  X  choices rather than organizational comportment. In organizational context DOI and TOE are the models of choice and have been widely used to study adoption of new and emerging technologies [29]. In Indian context Startups are formally defined by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion , Ministry of Commerce and Industry , as entity with following characteristics [30] a) Up to five years from the date of its incorporation/registration, Indian National Rupees 25 crore, and c) It is working towards innovation, development, deployment or commercialization of new products, processes or services driven by technology or intellectual property. Using TOE context to strengthen the DOI is a well-defined technique [31][32] and we propose the following constructs and hypothesis based on them -Relative advantage is the  X  X  X egree to which an innovation is perceived as being better than its precursor X  X  [33] . Innovations that have strategic advantage have far better chances of adoption by firms [34]  X  [36]. Thus H1: Relative advantage will positively influence RS adoption. Complexity is the  X  X  X egree to which an innovation is perceived to be relatively difficult to understand and use X  X  [33] . The easier it is to integrate the technology into business operations, the greater the chance of its adoption. RS technology may require entirely new professionals or intensive training of IT professionals. Thus, H2: Complexity will negatively influence RS adoption. Rogers [33] defines compatibility as  X  X  X he degree to which the innovation fits with the potential adopter X  X  existing values, previous practices, and current needs X  . An organization that finds the suitability of RS with its existing practices may adopt this technology and vice-versa. Thus, H3: Compatibility will positively influence RS adoption. Technology infrastructure and support are an important component for adoption of a technology, and it has been widely studied in various works related to IS adoption [37], [38]. Hence, RS also requires technology readiness as an important component. Hence, H4: Technological readiness will positively influence RS adoption. Top management support plays an important role in RS adoption because it guides the organisation towards a rather new technology like other information technology adoption [31], [37], [39].Top management that recognizes the benefits of RS is likely to allocate the necessary resources for its adoption and influence the organization X  X  members to implement the change. Thus, H5: Top management support will positively influence RS adoption. The environment context is the setting in which a firm conducts its business and is influenced by the nature of the industry. Internal as well as external environment from competitors form a peer pressure to adopt a new technology [31], [37]. Adoption of newer technology may help organization to compete with their peers by impacting the value chain. Hence, H6: Competitive pressure will positively influence RS adoption. The impact of regulatory support helps a firm to abide by a set of regulations which form a level playing field for all organization in industry [31], [40] . If a regulator supports the best technology to be carried out in an industry, it helps the adoption process. Thus, H7: Regulatory support will positively influence RS adoption. will be floated with sample frame being statrups currently being government backed initiative to promote and support startup ecosystem in India. Scales used to measure the constructs have been adopted from existing works [29] . Depending on the number of data samples collected, we intend to adopt the method of logistic regression [41] if number is small or Structure Equation Modelling [29] if the number is adequate enough for SEM for testing our hypothesis. Apart from providing an alternate and possibly more efficient method for GS and IU identification, this work will also study and provide psychographic profile of these GS and IU , and that information can be used by marketing manager to take more informed decision on how to meet the requirements of such users. Identification of factors that impact the adoption of RS by Indian Startups will help in designing and implementing of IT and digital marketing strategies in smaller firms. In the future we also propose a comparative study of RS adoption on large and small firms from similar and different geographies to find if there are any cultural factors too that impact RS adoption.
