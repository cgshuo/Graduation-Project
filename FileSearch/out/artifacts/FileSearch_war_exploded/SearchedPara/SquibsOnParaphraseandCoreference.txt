Paraphrase extraction 1 and coreference resolution have applications in Question An-swering, Information Extraction, Machine Translation, and so forth. Paraphrase pairs might be coreferential, and coreference relations are sometimes paraphrases. The two overlap considerably (Hirst 1981), but their definitions make them significantly different in essence: Paraphrasing concerns meaning, whereas coreference is about discourse referents. Thus, they do not always coincide. In the following example, b and d are both coreferent and paraphrastic, whereas a , c , e , f ,and h are coreferent but not paraphrastic, and g and i are paraphrastic but not coreferent. (1) [Tony] a went to see [the ophthalmologist] b and got [his] The discourse model built for Example (1) contains six entities (i.e., Tony, the eye doctor, to Tony, we say that they are coreferent. In contrast, in paraphrasing, we do not need to build a discourse entity to state that g and i are paraphrase pairs; we restrict ourselves to semantic content and this is why we check for sameness of meaning between cataracts and cloudy vision alone, regardless of whether they are a referential unit in a discourse.
Despite the differences, it is possible for paraphrasing and coreference to co-occur, as in the case of b and d .
 potential to improve understanding and generation systems. As a result, they have been the focus of a large amount of work in the past couple of decades (see the surveys by Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis [2010], Madnani and Dorr [2010], Ng [2010], and
Poesio and Versley [2009]). Before computational linguistics, coreference had not been studied on its own from a purely linguistic perspective but was indirectly mentioned in the study of pronouns. Although there have been some linguistic works that consider paraphrasing, they do not fully respond to the needs of paraphrasing from a computa-tional perspective.
 to point out the distinguishing factors that make paraphrase extraction and coref-erence resolution two separate yet related tasks. This is illustrated with examples extracted/adapted from different sources (Dras 1999; Doddington et al. 2004; Dolan,
Brockett, and Quirk 2005; Recasens and Mart  X   X  2010; Vila et al. 2010) and our own. Apart from providing a better understanding of these tasks, we point out ways in which they can mutually benefit, which can shed light on future research. 2.ConvergingandDivergingPoints
This section explores the overlapping relationship between paraphrase and coreference, highlighting the most relevant aspects that they have in common as well as those that distinguish them. They are both sameness relations (Section 2.2), but one is between meanings and the other between referents (Section 2.1). In terms of linguistic units, coreference is mainly restricted to noun phrases (NPs), whereas paraphrasing goes beyond and includes word-, phrase-and sentence-level expressions (Section 2.3). One final diverging point is the role they (might) play in discourse (Section 2.4). 2.1MeaningandReference
The two dimensions that are the focus of paraphrasing and coreference are meaning and reference, respectively. Traditionally, paraphrase is defined as the relation between two expressions that have the same meaning (i.e., they evoke the same mental concept), whereas coreference is defined as the relation between two expressions that have the same referent in the discourse (i.e., they point to the same entity). We follow Karttunen (1976) and talk of  X  X iscourse referents X  instead of  X  X eal-world referents. X  they only corefer in (1,1). We cannot decide on (non-)coreference in (2,1) as we need a discourse to first assign a referent. In contrast, we can make paraphrasing judgments 640 without taking discourse into consideration. Pairs like the one in cell (1,2) are only coreferent but not paraphrases because the proper noun Tony and the pronoun his have reference but no meaning. Lastly, neither phenomenon is observed in cell (2,2). 2.2Sameness
Paraphrasing and coreference are usually defined as sameness relations: Two expres-sions that have the same meaning are paraphrastic, and two expressions that refer to the same entity in a discourse are coreferent. The concept of sameness is usually taken for granted and left unexplained, but establishing sameness is not straightforward.
A strict interpretation of the concept makes sameness relations only possible in logic and mathematics, whereas a sloppy interpretation makes the definition too vague. In paraphrasing, if the loss of atthecity in Example (2b) is not considered to be relevant, Ex-amples (2a) and (2b) are paraphrases; but if it is considered to be relevant, then they are not. It depends on where we draw the boundaries of what is accepted as the  X  X ame X  meaning. (2) a. The waterlogged conditions that ruled out play yesterday still prevailed at (3) On homecoming night Postville feels like Hometown, USA . . . For those who
Similarly, with respect to coreference (3), whether Postville and the old Postville in Ex-ample 3 are or are not the same entity depends on the granularity of the discourse.
On a sloppy reading, one can assume that because Postville refers to the same spatial coordinates, it is the same town. On a strict reading, in contrast, drawing a distinction between the town as it was at two different moments in time results in two different entities: the old Postville versus the present-day Postville. They are not the same in that features have changed from the former to the latter.

If we understood  X  X ame meaning X  in the strictest sense, a large number of paraphrases would be ruled out. Thus, some authors argue for a looser definition of paraphrasing.
Bhagat (2009), for instance, talks about  X  X uasi-paraphrases X  as  X  X entences or phrases that convey approximately the same meaning. X  Mili  X  cevi  X  c (2007) draws a distinction between  X  X xact X  and  X  X pproximate X  paraphrases. Finally, Fuchs (1994) prefers to use the notion of  X  X quivalence X  to  X  X dentity X  on the grounds that the former allows for the existence of some semantic differences between the paraphrase pairs. The concept of identity in coreference, however, has hardly been questioned, as prototypical examples appear to be straightforward (e.g., BarackObama and Obama and he ). Only recently have
Recasens, Hovy, and Mart  X   X  (2010) pointed out the need for talking about  X  X ear-identity X  relations in order to account for cases such as Example (3), proposing a typology of such relations. 2.3LinguisticUnits
Another axis of comparison between paraphrase and coreference concerns the types of linguistic units involved in each relation. Paraphrase can hold between different linguistic units, from morphemes to full texts, although the most attention has been paid to word-level paraphrase ( kid and child in Example (4)), phrase-level paraphrase ( cried and burst into tears in Example (4)), and sentence-level paraphrase (the two sentences in Example (4)). (4) a. The kid cried.
In contrast, coreference is more restricted in that the majority of relations occur at the phrasal level, especially between NPs. This explains why this has been the largest focus so far, although prepositional and adverbial phrases are also possible yet less frequent, as well as clauses or sentences. Coreference relations occur indistinctively between pronouns, proper nouns, and full NPs that are referential , namely, that have discourse referents. For this reason, pleonastic pronouns, nominal predicates, and appositives cannot enter into coreference relations. The first do not refer to any entity but are syntactically required; the last two express properties of an entity rather than introduce a new one. But this is an issue ignored by the corpora annotated for the MUC and ACE programs (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997; Doddington et al. 2004), hence the criticism by van Deemter and Kibble (2000).
 pronouns and proper nouns) that should not be treated as members of a paraphrase pair on their own (Example (5a)) because paraphrase is only possible between meaningful units. This issue, however, takes on another dimension when seen at the sentence level.
The sentences in Example (5b) can be said to be paraphrases because they themselves contain the antecedent of the pronouns I and he . (5) a. (i) A. Jim  X  enez
In Example (5b), A. Jim  X  enez and I / he continue not being paraphrastic. Polysemic, un-derspecified, and metaphoric words show a slightly different behavior. It is not possible to establish paraphrase between them when they are deprived of context (Callison-
Burch 2007, Chapter 4). In Example (6a), police officers could be patrol police officers, and investigators could be university researchers. However, once they are embedded in a disambiguating context that fills them semantically, as in Example (6b), then paraphrase can be established between police officers and investigators . (6) a. (i) Police officers As a final remark, and in accordance with the approach by Fuchs (1994), we consider 642  X  X eferential X  and  X  X ognitive X  to be best treated as coreference rather than paraphrase, because they only rely on referential identity in a discourse. (7) a. They got married last year . 2.4DiscourseFunction
A further difference between paraphrasing and coreference concerns their degree of de-pendency on discourse. Given that coreference establishes sameness relations between the entities that populate a discourse (i.e., discourse referents), it is a linguistic phe-nomenon whose dependency on discourse is much stronger than paraphrasing. Thus, the latter can be approached from a discursive or a non-discursive perspective, which in turn allows for a distinction between reformulative paraphrasing (Example (8)) and non-reformulative paraphrasing (Example (9)). (8) Speaker 1: Then they also diagnosed a hemolytic X  X remic syndrome .
 (9) a. X wrote Y.
Reformulative paraphrasing occurs in a reformulation context when a rewording of a previously expressed content is added for discursive reasons, such as emphasis, correction, or clarification. Non-reformulative paraphrasing does not consider the role that paraphrasing plays in discourse. Reformulative paraphrase pairs have to be extracted from a single piece of discourse; non-reformulative paraphrase pairs can be extracted X  X ach member of the pair on its own X  X rom different discourse pieces. The reformulation in the third utterance in Example (8) gives an explanation in a language less technical than that in the first utterance; whereas Examples (9a) and (9b) are simply two alternative ways of expressing an authorship relation.
 in terms of cohesion. Being such a cohesive device, it follows that intra-document coreference, which takes place within a single discourse unit (or across a collection of documents linked by topic), is the most primary. Cross-document coreference, on the other hand, constitutes a task on its own in NLP but falls beyond the scope of linguistic coreference due to the lack of a common universe of discourse. The assumption behind cross-document coreference is that there is an underlying global discourse that enables various documents to be treated as a single macro-document.
 it close to coreference in the sense that they both contribute to the cohesion and devel-opment of discourse. 3.MutualBenefits
Both paraphrase extraction and coreference resolution are complex tasks far from being solved at present, and we believe that there could be improvements in performance if researchers on each side paid attention to the others. The similarities (i.e., relations of sameness, relations between NPs) allow for mutual collaboration, whereas the differ-ences (i.e., focus on either meaning or reference) allow for resorting to either paraphrase or coreference to solve the other. In general, the greatest benefits come for cases in which either paraphrase or coreference are especially difficult to detect automatically. More specifically, we see direct mutual benefits when both phenomena occur either in the same expression or in neighboring expressions.
 paraphrasing relationships between NPs for which coreference is easier to detect. For instance, coreference between the two NPs in Example (10) is very likely given that they have the same head, head match being one of the most successful features in coreference resolution (Haghighi and Klein 2009). In contrast, deciding on paraphrase would be hard due to the difficulty of matching the modifiers of the two NPs. (10) a. The director of a multinational with huge profits.
In the opposite direction, we can hypothesize coreference links between NPs for which paraphrasing can be recognized with considerable ease (Example (11)). Light elements (e.g., fact ), for instance, are normally taken into account in paraphrasing X  X ut not in coreference resolution X  X s their addition or deletion does not involve a significant change in meaning. (11) a. The creation of a company.
By neighboring expressions, we mean two parallel structures each containing a coref-erent mention of the same entity next to a member of the same paraphrase pair. Note that the coreferent expressions in the following examples are printed in italics and the paraphrase units are printed in bold . If a resolution module identifies the coreferent pairs in Example (12), then these can function as two anchor points, X and Y , to infer that the text between them is paraphrastic: X complained today before Y ,and X is formulating the corresponding complaint to Y . (12) a. Argentina X complained today before the British Government
Some authors have already used coreference resolution in their paraphrasing systems in a similar way to the examples herein. Shinyama and Sekine (2003) benefit from the fact that a single event can be reported in more than one newspaper article in different ways, keeping certain kinds of NPs such as names, dates, and numbers unchanged.
Thus, these can behave as anchor points for paraphrase extraction. Their system uses coreference resolution to find anchors which refer to the same entity.
 of text next to another NP helps to identify a coreference link between the two NPs, as shown by Example (13), where two diction verbs are easily detected as a para-phrase and thus their subjects can be hypothesized to corefer. If the paraphrase system 644 identifies the mapping between the indirect speech in Example (13a) and the direct speech in Example (13b), the coreference relation between the subjects is corroborated.
Another difficult coreference link that can be detected with the help of paraphrasing is Example (14): If the predicates are recognized as paraphrases, then the subjects are likely to corefer. (13) a. The trainer of the Cuban athlete Sotomayor said that the world record holder (14) a. Police officers searched11storesinBarcelona .
Taking this idea one step further, new coreference resolution strategies can be developed with the aid of shallow paraphrasing techniques. A two-step process for coreference resolution might consist of hypothesizing first sentence-level paraphrases via n -gram or named-entity overlapping, aligning phrases that are (possible) paraphrases, and hypothesizing that they corefer. Second, a coreference module can act as a filter and provide a second classification. Such a procedure could be successful for the cases exemplified in Examples (12) to (14).
 sentence-level paraphrasing. Meaning alone does not make it possible to state that the two pairs in Example (5b), repeated in Example (15), or the two pairs in Example (16) are paraphrases without first solving the coreference relations. (15) a. The Atl  X  etico de Madrid goalkeeper, A. Jim  X  enez , yesterday realized one of his (16) a. Secretary of State Colin Powell last week ruled out a non-aggression treaty .
However, cooperative work between paraphrasing and coreference is not always pos-sible, and it is harder if neither of the two can be detected by means of widely used strategies. In other cases, cooperation can even be misleading. In Example (17), the two bold phrases are paraphrases, but their subjects do not corefer. The detection of words like another (Example (17b)) gives a key to help to prevent this kind of error. (17) a. A total of 26 Cuban citizens remain in the police station of the airport of
On the basis of these various examples, we claim that a full understanding of both the similarities and disparities will enable fruitful collaboration between researchers working on paraphrasing and those working on coreference. Even more importantly, our main claim is that such an understanding about the fundamental linguistic issues is a prerequisite for building paraphrase and coreference systems not lacking in linguistic rigor. In brief, we call for the return of linguistics to paraphrasing and coreference automatic applications, as well as to NLP in general, adhering to the call by Wintner (2009: 643), who cites examples that demonstrate  X  X hat computational linguistics can achieve when it is backed up and informed by linguistic theory X  (page 643).
