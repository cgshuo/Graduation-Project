 We introduce a generic engine for large-scale similarity search and demonstrate it on a set of 100 million Flickr images. E.1 [ Data ]: Data structures X  Distributed data structures Algorithms, Design, Experimentation, Performance similarity and content-based search, metric space, scalability
Practically any information can currently be in digital form. Searching in future Internet will be complicated be-cause of: (1) the diversity of data types and ways in which data can be sorted, compared, or classified, and (2) the quickly increasing amounts of digital data. Accordingly, a successful search engine should address problems of extensi-bility and scalability . We present and demonstrate capabili-ties of MUFIN (Multi-Feature Indexing Network). MUFIN considers search problem in three dimensions: (1) data and query types, (2) index structures and search algorithms, and (3) infrastructures to run the system on. MUFIN adopts the metric space as highly extensible model of similarity [2]. Its indexing and searching mechanisms are based on the con-cept of structured Peer-to-Peer networks which makes the search highly scalable. Moreover, MUFIN is inherently in-dependent of specific hardware infrastructure.  X

We demonstrate an  X  X nstance of MUFIN X  designed for content-based search on large databases of general digital images. The dataset consists of 100 million Flickr images each of which is represented by five MPEG-7 visual descrip-tors provided by CoPhIR collection 1 . The descriptors are aggregated into a single metric space and the system re-trieves k images which are the most similar to a given query image (according to the aggregated metric). The data is in-dexed by a P2P-based data structure M-Chord [1] with 2000 logical peers. Peers organize their data locally in an M-Tree. The system physically runs on six IBM servers (two quad-core CPUs, 16G RAM, six disks with RAID 5). The search is demonstrated at http://mufin.fi.muni.cz/imgsearch/ . ALIPR searches a set of images according to automatically ImBrowse allows to search about 750,000 images by color, id  X ee searches a commercial database of 2.8 million images GazoPa is a private service by Hitachi searching 50 million All current CMIR systems, except for the very recent project GazoPa, search databases two orders of magnitude smaller than MUFIN. They are also typically designed only for dig-ital images searched by a specific method, which contrasts with the highly versatile MUFIN approach. [1] D. Novak, M. Batko, and P. Zezula.
