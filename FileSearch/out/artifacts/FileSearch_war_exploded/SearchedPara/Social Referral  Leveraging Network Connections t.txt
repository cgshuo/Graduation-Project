 Much work has been done to study the interplay between recommender systems and social networks. This creates a very powerful coupling in presenting highly relevant recom-mendations to the users. However, to our knowledge, little attention has been paid to leverage a user X  X  social network to deliver these recommendations. We present a novel ap-proach to aid delivery of recommendations using the recip-ient X  X  friends or connections. Our contributions with this study are 1) A novel recommendation delivery paradigm called Social Referral , which utilizes a user X  X  social network for the delivery of relevant content. 2) An implementation of the paradigm is described in a real industrial production setting of a large online professional network. 3) A study of the interaction between the trifecta of the recommender system, the trusted connections and the end consumer of the recommendation by comparing and contrasting the pro-posed approach X  X  performance with the direct recommender system.

Our experiments indicate that Social Referral is a promis-ing mechanism for recommendation delivery. The experi-ments show that a significant portion of users are recep-tive to passing along relevant recommendations to their so-cial networks, and that recommendations delivered through users X  social networks are much more likely to be accepted than those directly delivered to users.
 J.4 [ Computer Applications ]: Social and behavioral sci-ences Social referral, recommender systems, social network
Social Recommender Systems incorporate social ties to either a) Augment relevance of the presented results [4] b) To explain away the recommendation to the user by presenting social proof [3] or a combination thereof. These ideas are quite powerful in driving relevant engagement from the end user. However, not much attention has been paid in RecSys literature to leverage social ties to deliver recommendations. In this scenario a user X  X  connection becomes the channel to route content to the incumbent. The aspects that come into play in this setting are 1) Connection strength or a measure of trust between the users on either side of the connection and 2) The reputation or topical social influence of the user. Both of these aspects have been studied extensively [5]. We propose leveraging these ideas along with a traditional function of the recommender system i.e. recommending rel-evant content to the user to generate a delivery paradigm via the  X  X eferral X  mechanism. Consider how a content provider usually pushes recommendations to target users -They di-rectly deliver relevant products/articles to users via email or online notification streams such as Facebook Wall . The interaction of the users X  social network with this item is pri-marily used as a social proof to enhance the credibility of the recommendation.  X  X ocial Referral X  is the following alter-ation to this model : Upon a user X  X  (actor) engagement with a piece of content (say movie, news article or music piece) we surface from their network, other users who will poten-tially be interested in this content. In this model the con-tent provider does not directly engage with the target user, rather, they nudge the actor to refer this content to their social ties. The selection process of the referral recipients is guided by a function of 1) user-item relevance obtained from the traditional recommender systems and 2) user-user connection strength unveiled from the social network. In this fashion, network ties become effective channels to de-liver peer endorsed recommendations i.e. social referrals . We describe the properties and efficacy of our system in the context of industrial recommender system for recommending professional groups to end users in a large online professional network. The architecture proposed here is generic and can be applied to any other social settings as well.
Much work has been done in incorporating Social signals in Recommender Systems. In [4] Kautz et. al. proposed a method to integrate social network with collaborative filter-ing. It has been shown in [1, 2] that incorporating social net-work information in traditional recommender improves the outcome of the system. Guy et al.[3] introduced the concept of aggregated familiarity relationships to recommend people to connect to within an enterprise SNS.

From a different perspective, Lerman [7] studied the effect of user recommended stories as opposed to stories recom-mended by a CF based system and identified that the users are more interested in the former. In a similar study [8], the authors compared movie and book recommendations from friends with online recommender systems and found that incorporating the source of the recommendation introduced a probable bias in favor of the former.

In social science the concept of adoption of ideas and tech-nologies in the social network has been studied [6]. Algorith-mic studies to identify influential people in the social net-work and how they instigate subsequent adoption has also been carried out in [5]. However, any data driven method to deliver recommendation via early adopters and aid them to choose potential followers has not fully been explored. In this paper, we present a system that leverages propagation of relevant group recommendation via group members and aids them to selectively identify a subset of their connections for group recommendation. The selection process takes into account the probable affinity of the potential member to the group and hence, the recipients are more likely to accept the recommendation.
We study Social Referral in the context of professional groups in a large online professional network. A recommen-dation system has been incorporated on this website that periodically calculates the relevance score of a group for a member. This score is subsequently used to recommend new groups for a member. Members can also share a group that he is a member of to his connections. However, group shares necessitate manual selection of connections which may lead to inclusion of members who may not have the same level of interest for the group or exclusion of potentially interested members. In order to bridge the gap between the group rec-ommendation and group share, and aid members to select connections to share a group with, a seamless integration of these two sources of information is warranted.

Let U = { u 1 ,u 2 ,...,u n } be the set of users, G = { g g } be the set of groups. Let  X  : u i  X   X  U  X  U be a function that returns the neighbors of u i  X  U and  X  : u i  X  g j  X  be the relevance score of group g j for user u i . Then for a given k the objective here is for a 2-tuple ( u i ,g j ) to identify  X  N  X  U such that  X  u k  X   X  N, X  ( u k ,g j )  X   X   X  u k  X   X  ( u |  X 
N |  X  k  X  X  X  s ( s  X  (  X  ( u i ) \  X  N )(  X  ( u k ,g j ) &gt;  X  ( s,g is a predefined threshold. Thus for each member u we refer to as referrer from here on, and each group g j , we generate a set of recommendation of top-k target users,  X  from u i  X  X  neighbors, having a minimum relevance score of  X  . Figures 1(a), 1(b) delineate the process. After the referrer joins a group, he is prompted to recommend the group to a subset of his network as shown in 1(a). This subset of poten-tial target users are pre-calculated by the system and they are guaranteed to have a minimum level of affinity toward the group. Subsequently, each of the connections receive a personal group recommendation message from the referrer (Figure 1(b)).
The current group recommendation framework on this website takes into account both content and social aspect for recommendation purposes. We piggyback off of this framework to obtain user-group affinity scores. This step guarantees that when a group subscriber refers a group to one of his connections, the connection is highly likely to be interested in the group. We also compute the connection strength between members. Since the calculation of connec-tion strength is an orthogonal issue and can be done in a variety of ways, we use an existing in-house algorithm that, given a pair of members, returns the connections strength among them.

From an abstract level, for each (referrer, group) pair, the method searches the neighborhood of the referrer X  X  social network and extracts group affinity scores for those neigh-bors for the group in question. The potential target users are then reordered based on group relevance score and their connection strength with the referrer.
Each (referrer, group) pair can contain multiple target users that can be referred. However, the content of the group may not be equally relevant to all the target users. Analogously, the relationship between the referrer and the target user is also a salient attribute that contributes to the referral operation. We can recommend the target users with strongest connection strength in a members network to refer for a particular group. Alternatively, we could recommend the target users with highest recommendation score, or em-ploy a hybrid approach. Since for each ( u i ,g j ) pair we obtain a subset,  X  N of member u i  X  X  connections, we can obtain two different ordered list from  X  N i.e.  X  1 = (  X  u 11 ,  X  u where m &lt; n  X   X  ( u i ,  X  u m 1 ) &gt;  X  ( u i ,  X  u n 1 ...,  X  u |  X  N | 2 ), where m &lt; n  X   X  (  X  u m 2 ,g j ) &gt;  X  (  X  u  X  ( u i ,  X  u m 1 ) stands for the connection strength between u and  X  u m 1 . Subsequently, we can target top-k members from either of the two lists.
For each referrer, there might exist multiple groups he/she could refer to his network connections. Instead of flooding the referrer with candidates for all these groups, we have chosen to select one group per referrer to recommend tar-get users for based on different criteria. One criterion is group quality. We generate the quality of a group as a func-tion of recent activity pertaining to that group. We gen-erate the group quality score using the following equation: of unique commenters, number of unique posters and the to-tal number of members in the group and  X  represents a user defined parameter. This measure is generated for all the ac-tive groups considering their recent activity. The parameter  X  smoothes out the effect of group size with respect to their activity. Alternatively, for each group, we generate a set of potential recommendation target  X  N for a specific member , resents the connections strength between u i and u k . This measurement depicts the relevance of a group in terms of the average connection strength between the referrer and the target users. We have used both scores to select the group to recommend (named Better GRP and Stronger CONN re-spectively). Again, a combination of these two measures was also employed to compare performance: RQ ( u i ,g j ) = ln ( Q ( g j )) + ln ( R ( u i ,g j )). Thus for each referrer, we choose the group with the highest score calculated by any of the three measures defined above and select from the referrer X  X  connections, top-k potential recommendation targets.
Our goal is to test whether social referral is an effective channel for recommendation delivery. In designing exper-iments, there are two major questions we want to answer: 1) Are referrers receptive to passing along recommendations to their social network connections? 2) For target users, is there a significant difference in the acceptance rate of recom-mendations coming from social referral, and the acceptance rate of recommendations directly delivered to them? Fur-thermore, it is also worth investigating what factors affect a referrer X  X  decision on whether to make a referral or not, and what factors affect a target user X  X  decision on whether to accept a recommendation.
The data we used for this experiment came from a pro-fessional network, and the kind of recommendation we used was group recommendation for the members of this profes-sional network. We sampled a set of members who joined a group in the last 14 days. These were the referrers. On the other hand, we used a empirically proven in-house recom-mender system to compute top 100 group recommendations for each member. For each referrer we checked if the group the referrer just joined was also recommended to his/her network connections (aka friends) by the recommender sys-tem. Any of such connections is a target user to whom the referrer could make a referral of the group. An email was then sent to each of the referrer (Figure 1(a)). Each email contained links to five target users. A referrer could click on any or all of the five links, which will cause a group join invitation email to be sent to the clicked target user. A total of 85K emails were sent to referrers. As a control group for the experiment, we also sent out another set of recommen-dation emails directly to target user. The recommendation data and target user list were generated exactly in the same way as the first set of emails that were sent to referrers. The only difference here was that we bypassed the referrer and directly sent those recommendations to target users. A total of 16K emails were directly sent to target users.
How likely are referrers to send out a recommendation re-ferral to their network connections? Our experiments showed that about 7.8% of referrers clicked on links in the emails to send out a referral email to their network connections. This is a significant percentage which far outperforms average emails CTR X  X . Figure 3(a) depicts different referrer CTRs at connection strength ( CS ) where CTR denotes among all target users with connection strength less than CS , what fraction of them are referred. It showed that the higher the connection strength between the referrer and the target user, the higher the CTR is for the referrers. We also com-pared overall referrer CTR with referrer CTR X  X  for algorithm Better GRP, and algorithm Stronger CONN (Figure 3(a)). The data indicates that for the same connection strength, referrers are more likely to click on a referral link if the qual-ity of the recommended group is higher. This confirms our intuition that referrers are more likely to send referral to their closer friends, and more likely to recommend a group which they think is of a higher quality. Another interest-ing study we performed was to check if referrers X  X  selections would lead to more relevant recommendations to the tar-get users. It seems intuitive to think that a referrer might remove those recommendations they think are not relevant to the recipients. Figure 3(b) compares the distributions of recommendation relevance scores before and after refer-rer clicks. Surprisingly, it showed that the distributions of recommendation relevance scores are almost identical be-fore and after referrer selection. The result indicates that for the recommendations produced by an effective recom-mender system, the referrers are unable to tell which recom-mendations are more relevant to their network connections.
We compared the join rate for groups for group recom-mendations delivered via social referral and those directly delivered to target users (the control group in the experi-ment). Our experiments showed a strong join rate by target users for group recommendations coming from social refer-rals. In fact, group recommendations delivered via social re-ferral have more than twice as large acceptance rate (22.5%) than those directly delivered to target users (9.6%) (Figure 2).
 Figure 2: Join rate: Social referral vs. Direct deliv-ery
In addition, as shown in Figure 4(a), there is evident cor-relation between the join rate and the connection strength CS between referrers and target users. The join rate here denotes among all target users with connection strength less than CS , what fraction of them have joined. The more strongly a target user is connected to a referrer, the more likely that the target user will accept a recommendation re-ferral coming from the referrer.
The target user join rate is also affected by the relevance of recommendations and it is computed in a similar fashion as for Figure4(a). Figure 4(b) showed that more relevant recommendations lead to higher join rates.
One argument against the usage of the social referral is that direct recommendation seems more effective than the overall workflow of social referral. After all, in social re-ferral there are two steps of loss for the recommendations: a recommendation could be ignored by the referrer, or the target user. Using the experiment setup in this paper, a piece of recommendation would have a 9.6% of chance to be accepted via direct recommendation email, but only 2.2% of chance via social referral. However, there are several attrac-tive aspects about social referral. First, the user experience in social referral is better. Although the acceptance rate of 9.6% is significant for direct recommendations, it also means that over 90% of target users find the recommendations not useful. Adding to the fact that these were unsolicited rec-ommendations coming from the system, a significant portion of users will likely be annoyed by them. In a social refer-ral scenario, however, instead of receiving an unsolicited, cold recommendation, the target users receive warm recom-mendations coming from their network connections directly. Even though about 77% of target users still do not act on the recommendations, it is unlikely to annoy them as these are recommendations coming from their friends who act as filters on behalf of the system. Second, since referrers are already engaging with the recommended objects themselves, it is natural to piggyback the social referral process at var-ious engaging points for free. Although we used emails for the pilot study in this experiment, emails are by no means the only, or the most efficient channel. For example, in the context of a professional social network, the referrals could be brought to a referrer X  X  attention when the referrer joins a group, starts a group discussion, or follows a certain group discussion on the website. Finally, even with emails, an ad-ditional 2.2% acceptance rate is not to be easily dismissed for a lot of marketers.
Our main contributions in the paper are two folds. First, we presented Social Referral , a novel recommendation de-livery mechanism which leverages a target user X  X  social net-work for the effective delivery of relevant recommendations to the user. To our knowledge, most previous work has been focused on incorporating social network to improve recom-mendation relevance or explain recommendations. Little has been explored on leveraging social network for the delivery of recommendations. Second, we carried out a large scale user study with real world data that demonstrated the ef-fectiveness of social referral. Our study showed that referrers are receptive to passing along recommendations to their net-work connections, and that recommendations delivered via social referrals are more than twice as likely to be accepted by target users than those directly delivered to them.
