 Wikipedia provides a fast and flexible way for anyone to create and edit encyclopedia largest online knowledge bases containing 3,632,075 articles. Wikipedia is attracting processes and to see if there exist some interesting patterns and phenomenon of them. for example the Wikipedia could automatically know the state of administrator X  X  work be used to recommend the articl es to the proper admin users. Wikipedia. Some of the research aims at validating some laws like power law, network understand them in Wikipedia? 3) Could we provide an exploratory and visualized tool to give comprehensive description of the admin user in Wikipedia? and contribution of this paper could be summarized as follows: a. Systematic definition for ad ministrator characteristics b. Quantitative calculation by using social network analysis technology c. Visualization of administrator characteristics from different views, and give the corresponding measuring methods. In section 5, we concludes this paper with future research.

General properties of the Wikipedia system and its (Libyy Veng-Sam Tang, 2008) [6], it presented new method for calculating the degree performance that makes suitable for online use. important types of connections between scholars. In the paper (Serge, Galam. 2011) [2], proposed the Tailor Based Allocation (TBA) for multiple authorships, which may analyzing co-authorship networks specific to their research communities to shed light cohesion, such as the timely diffusion of new information, the creation of a common culture and the enforcement of social norms [4]. 3.1 Administrator Network network of five admin users; each one of them has contributed to some articles. 3.2 Initial Observations administrator X  X  network. Diameter and Clust ering Coefficient computed to examine the structure of the network at macro level. Since more robust measure of the pair-wise distances between nodes of a graph is the effective diameter centralization of the network around some active users. considerable nucleus of very active users who seems to be omnipresent.
