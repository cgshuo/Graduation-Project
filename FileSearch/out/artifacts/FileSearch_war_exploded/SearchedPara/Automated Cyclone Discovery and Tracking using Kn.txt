 Current techniques for cyclone detection and tracking employ NCEP (National Centers for Envi ronmental Prediction) models from in-situ measurements. This solution does not provide true global coverage, unlike remote satellite observations. However it is impractical to use a single Earth orbiting satellite to detect and track events such as cyclones in a continuous manner due to limited spatial and temporal cove rage. One solution to alleviate such persistent problems is to utilize heterogeneous sensor data from multiple orbiting satellites. However, this solution requires overcoming other new challenges such as varying spatial and temporal resolution between satelli te sensor data, the need to establish correspondence between f eatures from different satellite sensors, and the lack of definitive indicators for cyclone events in some sensor data. We describe an automated cy clone discovery and tracking approach using heterogeneous n ear real-time sensor data from multiple satellites. This approach addresses the unique challenges associated with knowledge discovery and mining from heterogeneous satellite data streams. We consider two remote sensor measurements in our cu rrent implementation, namely: QuikSCAT wind satellite measurements, and merged precipitation data from TRMM and other satellites. More satellites will be incorporated in the near future and our solution is sufficiently powerful that it generalizes to multiple sensor measurement modalities. Our approach consists of three main components: (i) feature extraction from each sensor measurement, (ii) an ensemble classifier for cyclone discovery, and (iii) knowledge sharing between the different remote sensor measurements based on a linear Kalman filter for predictive cyclone tracking. Experimental results on historical hurricane data sets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to previous work. I.5.4 [ Pattern Recognition ]: Applications Algorithms, Design. Mining massive data st ream, real-time data mining, heterogeneous data mining, multi-sensor data fusion, knowledge transfer, ensemble classifier, event tracking, event detection and prediction Tropical and extra-tropical cyclon es are important components of the Earth climate system that exhibit variability at different temporal and spatial scales. Cyclone landfall causes great devastation, incurs fatality, an d affects people X  X  livelihood. To identify and track tropical weather system, the Tropical Prediction Center/National Hurricane Center (TPC/NHC) uses conventional surface and upper-air observations and reconnaissance aircraft reports [1], and these are concentrated in the North American coasts and in Japan/Europe to some degree. Coverage on a global basis, especially in under-develop ed and developing nations such as large portions of Asia and Africa is limited or lacking which results in disastrous consequences in many of these regions. In recent years, some studies have used satellite images that are manually retrieved and analyzed to improve the accuracy of cyclone tracking; this procedure is currently slow, tedious, involves coverage of only local regions in North America, and requires close analysis by teams of experts. In this paper, we describe a novel automated global cyclone discovery and tracking approach on a truly global basis using near real-time (NRT) (and historical) sensor data from multiple satellites. Our current implem entation employs two types of satellite sensor measurements, namely: the QuikSCAT wind satellite data, and the merged precipitation data using TRMM and other satellites. We addre ss the challenges of mining heterogeneous data from multiple orbiting satellites at different spatial and temporal resolutions (see Figure 1). In particular, knowledge sharing between th e heterogeneous sensor measurements addresses the problem where some sensor measurements lack definitive indicator for cyclone events, and the spatial and temporal resolutions differ for different sensor. For instance, one cannot confidently identify cyclone based on TRMM precipitation data alone even though it has a finer temporal resolution than QuikSCAT. Through our knowledge sharing methodolog y, QuikSCAT wind data provides informatio n to th e TRMM p recip itation d ata about the likely cy clone locatio n so that th e TR MM detector can focus its sear ch on s ome loc al region and redu ces false alarm for cy clone d etection on TRM M data m eas urem ents (see F igur e 2 ).

Besides the challeng es posed by mining hetero geneous remote satell ite da ta, in genera l th ere are chal leng es rel ated speci fic ally to the problem of detection and tr acking of cy clo nes.

These work fo cus on detecting and track ing hurricanes that are lik ely to land fal l onl y in North Amer ica, and they involve human interf eren ce and decisions. Prior techniqu es proposed for automated sto rm or cy clon e identif ication and track ing use aeri al reconnaissance aircr aft d ata and local radar data that hav e limited cov erage and do not measure parameters on a global scale. An impro ved algorithm for the Weather Surveillance R adar, 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) has been proposed f or storm identification and track ing [5] . Sinclair and Liu [7] pr oposed an auto mated appro ach for the Dvorak techn ique us ing an el astic grap h d ynamic link model based o n elastic con tour matching. Lak shmanan et al.

Before descr ibing our approach in Section 5, we discuss the chal lenges tha t we encoun ter and how they are addr essed. Th e main issue of satell ite m easurem ents is that th ey are ins tantan eous . F or exam ple , a Q uikS CAT m eas urem ent does not quantif y  X  X ustained X  wind which de fines a cy clone.

While USA has at least four GOES, most countr ies d o not h ave such local w eath er monitoring satel lites . They hav e to rel y on publicl y av ailabl e dat a from orbiting s atellites. For an orbiting satellite, on e can only hav e data on a particu lar region at som e tim e instanc es per da y. Som etimes, the orbitin g satell ite m ay just m iss the reg ion com plete ly (See the whit e r egion between an y two side-b y-side swat hs in Figur e 3). Th is problem can be al lev iated to a large ex tent b y us ing s ensor m eas urem ents from m ultiple sa tell ites . Ver y often a swath of an orbiting sate llite captures parti al meas urem ent of the (c yclone) e vent of interest since one has n o control above th e satellite tr ajecto ry. Th e worst case scen ario is a com plete m iss. One s ees from the top right im age that th e s wath only captur es a  X  X mall X  region of the hurrican e in F igure 4. The bottom left im age, which is th e next swath af ter 1 orbit (101 minutes), contains a partial hur rican e. Th e bott om right im age contains a larg er hurricane reg ion but is missing the cy clon e ey e. The situ ations described abov e m ake cyclon e dis covery an d track ing es pecia lly diffi cult us ing only data from a single orbitin g QuikSCAT sate llit e. Again , usi ng m easurem ent s from m ultiple satellites can alleviate such situa tions if a solutio n can be found to handle the mining of d ata with var ying spatial and temporal res olutions between d iffer ent m eas urem ent t ypes. Measurements from different s ensor instrum ents on a sate llite have diff eren t temporal resolut ion. This is du e to the orb it tim e (QuikSCAT: 101 minutes, ~ 14 orbits/day ; TRM M: 92.5 minutes, ~16 orbits/day ), the swath wid th of sensor instrument (SeaWinds: 1800 km; TRMM (PR): 247 k m, TRMM (TMI): 878 km, TRMM (VIRS): 833 km), and geogr aphi cal coverage (QuikSCAT: Global; TRMM: 50N-50S). For QuikSCAT, it is usually abou t twelve hours th at measurements are tak en again on the same region. http://www. oso.noaa. gov/goes/ The spatial r esolution depends o n the sensor instruments (TRMM (TMI): 5.1km, TRMM (PR): 5.0km , TRMM (VI RS): 2.4km), the satell ite orbi tal altitud e (TRMM Pre-boost (350k m) (TMI): 4.4k m to 5.1km (Post-boost (403 km)), and th e processing algorithms (operational QuikSCAT data has spatial resolu tions of 12.5km and 25km). Different data produ cts from the same sensor satellite can also have d ifferen t spatial resolution . Lev el 3 data produ cts usuall y h ave lower spati al r esolution than Lev el 1 and 2 da ta products. For example, TRMM 3B4X where X = 0; 1 ; 2 and 3 data products have spatial re solu tion of more than 50km. Figure 4 .

Our approach re triev es and s earches reg ions in the TRM M da ta likel y to cont ain a c yclon e det ected e arlier from QuikS CAT data. Since th e 3B4 2 TRMM data and th e Quik SCAT data h ave differen t spati al resolution , we use the l atitude and longitud e as our fixed refer ence frame for all data ty pes. We performed linear transformations on the two data types from their referen ce frame to the fix ed ref erence frame befo re com puting the loc al se arch region on th e data. Sin ce 3B42 TR MM data is avai labl e ev ery 3 hours, the temporal resolution is significantly better and th e temporal cyclon e tr acking can therefore be done more accurately . tropical cyclon es and related weather ev ents. Hence, tropical cyclon e images are annotated, organized and well-documented One can e asily download sate llit e dat a th at conta in rel evant cyclon e events to anal yze an d vis ualiz e. On the other han d, http: //shar aku. eorc.j axa .jp/TYP_DB/index_e.shtml inter esting non-cy clone events ar e not organ ized and documented like the cyclon e events. They are hidden in the massive amount of unlabe led dat a in the archiv al d atab ases. Ther e are no exis ting well-def ined neg ativ e ex amples. In this p aper , w e select random regions in the QuikSCAT images from day s wher e no cy clone is detected as negativ e examples . One area of fut ure work is to incorpora te te chnolog y in s emi-supervised learn ing [17] to c yclone de tection . In Section 5.1, we describe the QuikSCAT features used in our ensemble approach for cy clone d etection d escrib ed in Section 5 .2. Our cy clone tr acking solution based on knowledge sharin g between heterog eneous TRMM and QuikSCAT data is describ ed in Section 5 .3. In our automated cy clon e iden tification and tracking appro ach , featur es which chara cteriz e and identif y a cyclone are s elect ed and extr acted fr om the QuikSCAT satel lite da ta. W e ut ilize the QuikS CAT Level 2B data whic h cons ists of ocean wind vector inform ation orga nized b y fu ll or bital revo lution of the satell ite a s orbiting revo lution takes about 101 minutes. Th e Lev el 2B data are grouped b y rows of wind vector cells ( WVC) which are squares of dimension 25 km or 12. 5 km. A complete cover age o f the ear th circum ference requir es 1624 WVC rows at 25 km spatial resolution , and 3 248 rows at 12.5 km spatial resolution. Th e 1800 km swath width amounts to 72 25 km WVCs or 144 12.5 km WVCs . Occas ionall y, the m eas urem ents lie ou tside the s wath . Hence, th e Lev el 2B data contai ns 76 WVCs at 25 km spatial resolution and 152 WVCs at 12.5 km spatial r esolution to accom modate such ins tances . There ar e 25 f ields in the data str ucture for th e Level 2B data.

The fie lds that are of int erest to us are sum marized in the Table 1. After the Leve l 2B data is re ceived, i t needs to be inte rpola ted o n a uniformly grid ded surface. Th is is due to the n on-uniform ity in the m easurem ents taken b y the QuikSCAT satel lite on a spher ical surface.

When a region contains a cy clone, the WS histogram shows a Furthermore, W D histogram show s a  X  X ear unifo rm X  distribution. According to the Nationa l Oceani c a nd Atm ospheric Administration (NOAA), a cy clone is defined to be a  X  X arm-core non-frontal s ynoptic-scale X  sy stem, with  X  X rganized deep convection and a closed surface wind circulatio n about a well-defined center X . To discrimi nate between cy clone and non-cyclon e even ts based on this circulation prop erty , we use two addition al fe atu res: (i) a m eas ure of rela tiv e strength of th e dominant wind direction (DOWD) [14] , and (ii) the relativ e win d vorticity (RWV).

Two classifiers ar e s imple thres holdi ng clas sifier bas ed on the DOWD and the RWV features . The o ther thre e c lassifiers are support vector mach ine (SVM) [18 ] using h istogram features for WS and WD, and DSR described in Section 5 .1. The classification decision is based o n a majority vote among the fiv e clas sifiers . 
Figu re 5. En semb le Clas sifie r (Cyclon e Dis covery Mod ule) Our m ulti-sensor knowledge-sha ring solution leverages the strength of each remote senso r type. QuikSCAT has exc ellent inform ation for ac curat e cyclo ne de tec tion bu t la cks suffic ient temporal r esolution (each p ass-through is rep eated ev ery 12 hours). TRMM on the other hand has excellent temporal resolution of 3 hours, but lacks good discriminativ e ability for accur ate cyclone dete ction . Ther efore, we em ploy QuikS CAT for cyclon e detectio n (ever y 12 hou rs), and TRMM data for tracking (ever y 3 hours) based on knowledge obtained fr om the ensemble clas sifier us ing QuikS CAT features . This s olution th erefor e ensures a high dete ction ra te for c yclon es while m aintaining a fi ne temporal resolu tion during cyclone track ing. Our automated cyclon e tracking using knowledge sharing is shown in Figure 6. Initia lly, QuikS CAT data is ret rieved from the datab ase or from real-time streaming in formation , and is input into the cyclon e discover y module (Figure 5) to locate/id entif y possible cy clon es. The c yclone lo cation is then used to predic t th e regions that ar e likel y to conta in a c yclone at the next inco ming data stream stream is the 3 B42 TRM M data, a cons train ed search is carried out around the region most likely to con tain the cy clone as identif ied b y the Kalm an Fil ter predi ctor . This constrain ed track ing via the Kalm an Filter pr edic tor is especi ally im portan t for the 3B42 TRM M precip itation dat a as it is not a defin itiv e indicator of cyclones and is susceptible to h igh f alse alarms. Th e estim ated s ear ch region local izes the region that is m ost likel y to contain cy clon e based on past cyclone tr acks and hence the incid ence of f alse alarm s is m inim ized b y a l arge m argin . A cyclon e is lo calized b y app lying a thr eshold to the TRMM precip itation r ate measurement (T6 = 0) . After a cy clone is located in the TRMM data, the Ka lman filter measurement update ( X  X orrect ion X ) is applied to obt ain an es tim ate of the new s tate vector or th e predicted location o f the cy clone in the next TRMM (or QuikSCAT) observation cy cle af ter 3 hours.

We ther efore model the c yclone usin g the m axim um and m inim um latitud e/long itude of the bound ing box spanned b y the cyclon e.

This modeling appro ach s ignif ican tly improves the quality of knowledge sharing b etween heterog eneous sate llit es as com pared to using a predictor /tracke r using only the center coordin ates of the cy clone. Experim ent res ults show the com petitiv e per form ance of our proposed ensemble classifier. W e show that the classifier b ased o n the new RW V fe ature is bett er th an the DOW D feature in term s of clas sificat ion p erform ance . W e als o dem ons trate th e c yclone discover y and tr acking s ystem using both Level 2B QuikSCAT data and 3B42 TRMM data. Our train ing d ata consists of 19 1 QuikSCAT images of trop ical cyclon es (i.e. tro pical depr essi on, tropical storms, and hurr ican es) occurring in the North Atlanti c Ocean in 2003. We also random ly collected 1833 unlabeled examples from four da ys in 2003 when no tropica l cyclone occurr ed. The se exam ples , labeled as negat ive exam ples , ar e i ncluded in to th e train ing s et. Our tes ting s et consists of 84 cyclone even ts in the North Atlantic Ocean in 2006 and 1822 non-cy clone events , collected from four day s in th e same year when there was no tro pica l cyclone. First, we deter mine the thresh olds for the DOW D and RWV featur es. One notes that from Figure 7 if a threshold value o f 1.958 is used, an optim al training accur acy for the DOW D 0.7958 and a true negativ e rate of 0.3840. One can increase this For the RW V clas sifier, on e s ees that from Figur e 8 if a thres hol d value of 1 .51 is used, an optimal training accuracy of 0.85 can be achi eved . Th is corresponds to a true positiv e r ate of 0.8010 and a true n egative rate of 0 .8910. On e can increase this threshold if a higher true neg ative rate is desirabl e, or to decrease the threshold if a high er tru e positive r ate is preferr ed. The ROC curves i n Figure 9 show that RWV is a more robust f eatur e th an DOWD in discriminating cy clone and non-cyclon e events. The perform ance of the DOW D clas sifier [14] , the RWV classifier, the C yclone Discove ry Module (CDM), the cy clon e identif ication s ystem (CIS ) [14] and the S VM ens emble [14] are com pared in Ta ble 2 . W e also c onstructed two sm aller ensem ble clas sifiers , one with RW V clas sifier rem oved from CDM (SVM +DOW D ens emble) and t he other with DOWD classifier removed from CDM (SVM+RVW ensemble) to compare the performance among differ ent ens embles. The S VM ensem ble us es identic al param eters to the S VM classifiers in th e CDM. The CIS parameters are f ound in [14] . Th e DOWD and RW V clas sifiers use th e thr esholds we determin ed earl ier. The par ameters for CDM are s et as follows : T1=12m /s, T2=400 pixels , T3=1.510 , T4=1 .958, and T5 = 2. From Table 2, one sees that C DS is a significant improvemen t from the CIS . Moreover, RW V clas sifier b y its elf is a lso a powerful classifier with both a hi gh true positive rate ( TPR) and a extrem ely favo rable tru e nega tive rate (TNR) com pared to th e other cl assifiers . However, for R WV clas sifier to achi eve th e TP R of CDS (b y lowering th e thresh old valu e), its TNR becom es les s than 0 .7.

TPR 0.9167 
TNR 0.7607 From Table 2, one observes th at ev en though DOWD classifier and S VM+DOW D ens emble are weak er cl assifiers on neg ativ e exam ples , the in clus ion of DOWD clas sifier into the S VM+RW V ens emble cl assifier to b ecom e the CDM im proves the TNR b y more than 0.07 .

Figure 10 demonstrates the f eas ibility of tracking methodolog y using both Level 2B QuikSCAT data and 3B42 TRMM data for Hurricane Isab el in North Atlant ic Ocean in 2003 for two day s. We include th e detection and track ing sequen ce for the 200 7 Hurricane Gonu (reaching C ategor y 5 wind s peed lev el), the strongest tropical cy clone since r ecord k eeping begun in 1945 for the North Indian Ocean and the Arabian S ea, as addit ional ma terial 14 to support our tr ack ing methodolog y. Hurricane Gonu is an interestin g event as tropi cal cy clon es develop ed in the Arabian Sea v ery ra rel y exc eed the tropi cal sto rm intensit y, i.e. becom ing a hurr ican e. We briefly discuss two salie nt lessons learned from our experience in d esigning and imp lementing the au tomated cyclone detection and tr acking proto type. First, even thou gh we can eas ily with th e data pr ocessing team to understand th e satellite d ata, its http://shensh yang.googlep ages.com/gonu.ppt characteristics, and i ts li mi tations. Man y different s cien ce products ar e available from each satellite sens or. One needs to know which science product is th e mo st relev ant for the prob lem. For example, a Level 3 QuikSC AT product has too low resolutio n for good detection performan ce ev en thoug h it is gridded. Moreover, we n eed to understan d th e features of the data produ ct that could be useful for cyclon e identif ication. Good communication with the data pro cessing team shortens our time in understand the d ata and implemen ting our prototype s ystem. Second, to bu ild up a s ystem de plo ying heterog eneous data, on e should include the differ ent measur ement data in to the s ystem one at a tim e, starting from the m eas urem ent d ata that ens ures a reasonably go od performance. Th en one includ es oth er measurem ent da ta in crem ent ally while m ainta ini ng or im proving the curren t system perform ance one a t a time. Knowledge shar ing between dif ferent sa tellites is a cha llenging and as yet unr esolved problem, and an eff icient solution s uch as ours that taps t he inform ation fro m such dis parate s ourc es wil l greatly improve science data und erstanding in v arious domains in environmental and space scien ce. To date, we have tested our implementation over a longer time scale in a region where ther e are oc currenc es of m ultiple c yclones tha t will al low us to demonstrate the global tracking capability of our implementation . Due to page li mitations , s ome is sues such as (i) the effe ct of differen t prep rocessing algorith ms for historical and NRT data, discussed. Thes e (open) issues t ogeth er with th ose discussed i n understand how one can improve near real-time knowledge mining of satellite d ata and desi gn new data mining techniques fo r satell ite da ta. Autonomous kn owledge discov ery from massive heterogen eous satell ite data i s extrem ely d esirabl e for ad vance s cientif ic understanding of the global climate , environm ental scienc e, s pace science, and Earth sc ien ce. Yet, conv entional methods cannot handle such massive unlabeled high-dimensional heterogen eous data. These da ta re ma in largely unexplored and under-utilized du e to the lack of hum an res ources to manuall y analyze s uch data using science experts, and in adequate data mini ng techn iques to process these data. Th is works provide a glim pse into the m any research oppor tunities in m ining and data un derstanding fro m such publicly available satellite d ata.
