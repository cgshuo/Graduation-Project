Moreover communication device technologies are evolving towards a communications tool, called the  X  X biquitous Internet X  by which we can use multiple device for web content operations. Fusion of real and cyber world will be accelerated by the ubiquitous Internet. Users operate equipments in real world through a digital content [6] . User X  X  activity is stored in user X  X  digital devices and replayed on particular digital devices [4, 5]. and a digital content can be operated by real materials[7]. A way of using web content will also change by the new communication technology. Future web content will be used as a sign-board on the ubiquitous Internet. Users will use a web content like a poster on the bulletin board. Users may expect that the information can be copied from a digital bulletin board to other devices such as PDA, memory device and so on [1], operated on the display screen directly[2], and changed browser X  X  appearance by user X  X  preference [3].
 operation mechanism that can be used as a bulletin board.The system has a Field with autonomous behaviors, and each Field enables us to retrieve, browse and integrate web content intuitively .We also describes a practical implementation of the system called the Personal Web Bulletin Board (PWBB). Today X  X  paradigm of web browsing is on a PC or PDA display screen will no doubt have to be modified to take full advantage of ubiquitous computing tech-nology. In particular, through ubiquitous computing, we may be able to have easy access to multiple screens on which we can to retrieve, browse and edit web contents. Let us assume that individual screens can be assigned a number of operations,such that regions on the screens will be devoted to these operations. We call such a region is Field . The user can assign an autonomic behaviors to Field . Users will likely expects that each Field acts the role autonomically when a web content is put on it. Each Field will also conform to an individual user X  X  content view. By selecting the kind of function,a user can develop a personal vir-tual portal interface for viewing web contents on the Internet. We have already developed a prototype,  X  X ersonal Web Bulletin Board X  , that can operate auto-nomically and be viewed like a portal web site on a Field .The following section describes the prototype X  X  applications. The  X  X ersonal Web Bulletin Board X  has two kinds of functions. First, the board can implement several web retrieval functions and editing functions. Second, users can develop their own style of viewing web content aggregations. The function enables us to acquire our necessary information easier. 3.1 Autonomic Web Content Operation on Field The application is for acquiring information from the Internet. Users find some web contents by using conventional web search engines, and they put the web content onto the Field on the screen. Our prototype has five different functions, and each Field has an autonomic behavior depending on its function. For exam-ple, a Retrieval Field is assigned a tf/idf web content retrieval mechanism. The prototype functions are illustrated in Fig.1. They are: 1. Retrieval of web content by using a conventional web search engine. 2. Selection of web content by dragging it onto a Similar Content Retrieval 3. Dragging the selected content onto the Linked Content Retrieval Field . The 4. Dragging the content onto the Clipping Field . The field can clip a part of a glanc e because a n u m b e r o f function s ar e execute d o n the Field . 3. 2 Persona l Virtua l Porta l unction automaticall y categorize s an d i ntegrate s article s fro m numerou s page s base d on the user X  X  preference after gathering these pages from various web sites. This function has two unique features: (1)application of the  X  X ook X  and  X  X eel X  of the dragged top page from another Field, with part of the original content being replaced by the integrated content, and (2)automatic categorization and inte-gration of collected information based on the user X  X  preferences. Whenever a user accesses an integrated page after browsing pages in another Field, he/she can obtain the desired content efficiently because the integrated page presents pages refreshed on the basis of the user X  X  behavior, which reflects his/her in-terests and knowledge. In addition to the integrated page framework, methods based on the user X  X  preferences for replacing and categorizing content have been developed using an HTML table model and a vector matching model. We have described a new concept of displaying, browsing, and retrieval for web contents, which is executed by adding autonomic behaviors to Field on browser. The behaviors are executed when web content puts on the Field or user pref-erences are provided to the Field . We also described the Personal Web Bulletin Board (PWBB). PWBB provides autonomic web retrieval, scrolling, clipping functions assigned to Field , which enables us to browse the integrated web con-tent according to the user X  X  own style. These functions can work effectively as an new web content operation. Users can acquire their necessary information brows-ing the integrated web content through their own style and operating various web content on the screen interactively.
