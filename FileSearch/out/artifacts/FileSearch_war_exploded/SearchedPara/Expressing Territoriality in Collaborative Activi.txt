 Territoriality, the expression of ownership towards an object, can emerge when social actors occupy a shared social space. In my research, I extend the study of territoriality beyond previous work in physical space in two key ways: 1) the object in question is virtual and 2) the social context is an online community engaged in collaborative activity. To do this, I observe the emergence of characteristic territorial behaviors (e.g. marking, control, defense) within collaborative authoring and social tagging. My dissertation then uses these observa tions to construct a theoretical framework for online territoriality to provide researchers and designers of groupware with guide lines with which to encourage ownership expression when appropriate. H.5.3 [ Information Interfaces and Presentation ]: Group and Organization Interfaces Human Factors, Theory, Design Territoriality, ownership, social tagging, collaborative authoring When groups collaborate to produce artifacts and knowledge, issues of control and ownership in evitably arise. Territoriality, the communicative expression of owners hip, signals to others that there is an individual or group that has taken control of a space. The characteristic behavior that is most associated with the expression of territoriality is marking , the placement of an object or substance into a space to indicate ownership of one X  X  territory [3]. Territoriality can also be expressed through defense , actions that serve as a response to a per ceived invasion of an established territory [3]. In collaborative activity, excessive or inappropriate expressions of ownership may be detrimental to the task at hand, especially if territoriality prevents members of the group from cooperating with one another. On the other hand, without a certain level of proprietary attachment to the community, individual commitment to the group task may wane, resulting in less effective collaboration [6]. As a result, I propose that, within the proper context, appropriate expressions of territoriality will have a beneficial effect on collaborative processes. Prior research about territoriality has focused on physical space or physical objects but less work ha s been conducted regarding the expression of proprietary ownershi p of intangible objects, such as ideas, roles or group membership [1,3,5]. In my dissertation research, I extend the study of territoriality to online communities by focusing on the following research questions: By drawing upon existing research on territoriality, I propose a socio-technical framework that describes factors that influence the expression of territoriality in soci al systems. My dissertation is divided into two portions: theory-building and theory-testing. I use descriptive, exploratory methods in the first portion to observe how territoriality emerges in online space according to the proposed framework. To test whether or not these initial observations are systematic expr essions of ownership, I am conducting a field study, observing language use and communicative behaviors in a social tagging system. The proposed framework had been developed to organize, categorize and understand the context in which territoriality develops and emerges. Are users creating or authoring the object around which social activity centers within the system? Because the created product can be a tangible indicator of one  X  X  expertise or a mechanism for building one X  X  reputation within a community, social systems that encourage higher levels of authorship may increase feelings of ownership towards the authored content [2]. As a result, users may be more likely to express territoriality in systems where they have created something of value (e.g. a Wikipedia article, a blog post). How valuable is the social space to its inhabitants? A territory is more likely to be marked and defe nded if its inhabitants perceive it to be valuable. When a space is deemed worthy and desirable by a number of social actors, it b ecomes vulnerable to invasion. In the case of online collaborative systems, a high level of effort that is expended by users while contributing to the community may serve as a signal to others that its habitants value the shared social space. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s). What kind of leadership style has emerged within the social system? Focusing on accepted leadership style is important with respect to how conflict over issues of control and ownership are negotiated as leaders can transmit the accepted norms and values to the rest of the community through their actions [7]. As a result, the characteristic territorial expre ssions within the system may be guided by the actions of those in leadership roles. How does a user X  X  social role within the activities of the system affect how territoriality is expressed? Social roles help to determine the dynamics of a group and structure the valence of communication between parties. For example, the outsider as social role creates an in-group, out-group dynamic that may also result in increased territorial be havior. Defensive behaviors may arise when a perceived outsider attempts to break into an online community, against the wi shes of the in-group. To date, I have conducted two qualitative studies to observe the emergence of territoriality in onlin e social environments. In the first, I examined social tagging within a large enterprise where different types of users employ tagging strategies to reach specific audiences [9]. In the second, I describe how the Maintainers, a group of lead users, express territoriality in Wikipedia by appropriating existing functionality to exert control over artifacts [8]. From these initial studies, user expertise encouraged the expression of territoriality in both contexts by structuring the activities of social roles within the collaborative communities. The evangelist, an emergent social role within a tagging system, used social tagging as a way to mark his or her expertise by communicating to others that he or she owned knowledge of a given topic [9]. In the case of Wikipedia, the maintainers applied template that despite its exp licit warning against ownership, served as a marker publicly signaling to other editors that there was someone who had expertise a bout the content of the article [8]. Territorial strategies, in both on line environments, were employed to control access to the social spaces. Within enterprise social tagging, we observed that those who played the role of team leader used insider language to influence tag choice so that non-group members would not be able to recognize the terminology used to describe resources and therefore, would be unable to contribute [9]. The maintainers adopted a primary contributor style of authorship, despite warni ngs against ownership of articles within Wikipedia policy guidelines, and appropriate existing mechanisms, such as reverting edits or tracking changes, to monitor their pages to prevent unwanted entry by unfamiliar editors [8]. To evaluate the generalizability of the observations from the initial descriptive studies, I am currently conducting a final field study of a mobile social tagging system, where I focus on how social roles, as structured by e xpertise, influence how territoriality is expressed. The testbed syst em, MobiTags, is a handheld tour of open storage cases within th e Johnson Museum on the Cornell campus where users employ tags to both navigate the interface and to generate additional descri ptors of the objects depicted on the tour [4]. In addition, the system allows users to vote tags up or down, which serves as a rating system. Experts (n=20), in this context, are users with knowledge regarding art, art history and visual studies (e.g docents, curators, artists and art history majors) will be compared to general muse um visitors (n=20). I use a combination of observation, interv iews and tag activity to observe and measure expressions of territoriality. I hypothesize that experts will be more likely to vote down novice-generated tags, and create tags that employ insider terminology to signal their expertise. The main contribution of this dissertation will be the construction and initial evaluation of a theoretical framework that describes the expression of territoriality within virtual space. This model will have implications for the design of systems in the field of computer-supported cooperative work, especially those that deal with shared intellectual and c ognitive resources. Specifically, I intend to provide insight into the particular factors that influence how and when territoriality shoul d be expressed. My initial results suggest that territoria lity can be encouraged within collaborative activities that depend on a hierarchical management style for success but that the interactions between perceived insiders and outsiders must be managed so that experts (e.g. longtime members) and novices (e.g. newcomers) are both encouraged to contribute. 1.
