 This research explores the notion of slow search , where re-trieval speed may be traded for improvements in result qual-ity. This time-quality tradeoff leads to a number of impli-cations for user interface and algorithm design. We will explore this space along various dimensions, including be-havioral and qualitative analyses of interaction to investi-gate the value a user that is able to perceive when given the option to use slow search in addition to traditional search. We will also examine how different notions of  X  X uality X  that a system might optimize may fit into this framework.

With the current popularity of Web search, users have be-come accustomed to information retrieval systems that are optimized to return the results of a search query within a fraction of a second. In order to be this fast, system imple-mentors must make trade-offs between speed and quality. Traditionally, many IR systems make a number of simplify-ing assumptions about the linguistic complexity of queries and documents, and the time budget given to document matching, ranking, and additional distinguishing features such as personalization tends to be very small [4, 2]. With these simplifications, the scope of potential improvements may be limited for topic relevance, personalization, or rank-ing for diversity.

Proposed by D  X  ork et al. [1] and Teevan et al. [4] in 2013, slow search refers to the notion that a system may  X  X ake its time X  to process results for additional effectiveness. Inspired by other  X  X low X  movements such as slow food, slow travel, and slow technology [3], the authors posited that such a sys-tem may also lead to changes in how individuals and groups approach the process of search if a system emphasized slow-ness over speed. The authors proposed that users would be encouraged to be more mindful and reflective through revisiting previous journeys and exploring connections and relationships between search results.

In our work, we explore the space of time-quality trade-offs in search, and investigate the value that users perceive in the face of such trade-offs, as well as how users X  search behaviors change when learning the capabilities of such sys-tems. Primarily, this involves behavioral log analysis of new system designs as well as qualitative methods. Addition-ally, we are interested in the various ways in which we may improve quality with new algorithms that are flexible to dy-namic time constraints.
Our research goals center around understanding 1. how users X  mental models are constructed as they become accli-matized to new search paradigms, 2. how individuals may use these novel systems depending on how much value they attribute to these systems, and 3. how we may use the lessons learned by addressing the aforementioned goals to design new algorithms and interfaces. The findings from this research will enable us to understand the ways in which we may build flexible IR systems that can address the under-served needs of users, being aware of contextual constraints such as time and urgency.
