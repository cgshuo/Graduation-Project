 ALVIN CHIN, BIN XU, HAO WANG, LELE CHANG, and HAO WANG , Nokia Research Center Online Social Networking sites (OSNs) like Facebook have blossomed over the past few years, however, they have not been well integrated with real-life interactions. The growing usage of GPS-enabled mobile phones and location-based applications, such as Foursquare, connect users X  offline activities with their online social networks. However, GPS positioning technologies can only cover the outdoor location of users and do not work well indoors. Due to the pervasiveness of WiFi networks in indoor places like hotels and offices, WiFi has now become viable for location tracking and navigation such as the Ekahau Real-Time Location System [Ekahau 2011].

According to Engestrom [2005],  X  X ocial networks consist of people who are connected by a shared object X , which he calls object-centered sociality. For example, in Flickr, the social objects are the photos which users tag, comment on, and share with others. In the physical environment, physical resources are social objects where people connect to each other. Therefore, the problem yet to be solved is how to use the resources in the physical environment to help facilitate social networking. Connecting users with physical resources can not only give users facilities to manage these resources more easily, like finding a room in a conference, but also can help to bridge the gap between offline and online behaviors. Our objective is to integrate offline activities and interactions captured in real time with online activities and interactions in a conference environment in order to provide opportunities for potential people one should connect to because one was together with them. We call this ephemeral social networking.
Our research questions are the following. First, how can social connections be es-tablished and integrated with physical resources in a conference through positioning technology? Second, how can physical proximity affect and be affected by online social connections, and can this relationship be used to establish and extend users X  social networks, both online and offline? To address the preceding questions, we designed and developed Find and Connect that uses conference resources such as session rooms for social objects and uses encounters between two users for physical proximity. We conducted two field trials, one at a multitrack conference called UIC/ATC 2010 and another at a single-track internal marketing event called GCJK. For our first research question, we describe the features then analyze the usage statistics for the two tri-als, in order to demonstrate the usefulness and viability of Find and Connect. For the second research question, we study the correlations between physical proximity and online social behaviors. Our hypotheses are the following. Greater physical proximity encounter duration and frequency will result in an increased probability for a person to establish an online connection such as friendship due to social selection (H1), and after users have established this online connection, the probability of users being physically proximate to each other will increase due to social influence (H2).

Our results show that social connection features that are reciprocal in relationship, such as friendship and exchanged contacts, have tighter, denser, and highly clustered networks compared to unidirectional relationships such as follow. For relationship be-tween physical proximity and social connection, we discover that H1 is supported. However, contrary to our original hypothesis H2, after the aforesaid online connec-tions are established, more online social interactions result in a decreased duration and frequency of offline interactions between the connected users and social influence is weak.

Our major contributions are twofold. First, we demonstrate the viability and usability of Find and Connect for bridging the gap between offline and online using encounters by conducting two trials and study the online social networks that are developed from our design. Second, we examine the relationship between physical prox-imity and online social connections in an indoor environment. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Related work is discussed in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe our system and user interface for the UIC/ATC 2010 conference and GCJK meeting. In Section 4, we discuss physical proximity in the form of encounters, introduce the concept of an ephemeral social network, discuss online social connections, and discuss how physical proximity encounters can affect online social connections. In Section 5, we conduct a user behavior analysis of the two trials, then report the quantitative results of the temporal relationship between physical proximity and online social connections. Finally, we conclude the article in Section 6 and outline areas for future work. A large number of location-based applications have now appeared due to the ubiquity of mobile device usage and mobile network coverage. For example, Home-Explorer [Guo et al. 2008] finds physical artifacts in a smart indoor environment, while applications such as Foursquare use location to allow users to check-in to find interesting friends and places. Some research services, such as Intel X  X  PlaceLab [Hightower et al. 2006] and MIT X  X  iFind [Huang et al. 2007], focus on improving accuracy and its impact on the social network. Tsai et al. [2009] focus more on the impact of feedback with their location-sharing application. Barkhuus et al. [2008] study how the awareness of location impacts self-presentation, yet they do not discuss impacts on the social network. WhozThat [Beach et al. 2008] is a system built on mobile phones to create a context-aware mobile social network, but does not utilize how location awareness offers facilities to users. These applications or systems fail to help users create and maintain their social network to bring convenience and facilities to users. The next step beyond location-based services is to use position data collected by these location-based applications to answer sociological problems. Underlying patterns emerge when combining users X  online behavioral interactions with properties of their offline behavior before, during, or after their online social connections are established.
To quantify users X  offline behaviors, a person X  X  physical proximity can be one rep-resentative social property of user behavior. For example, Eagle and Pentland [2009] use the phone X  X  GPS location data to present the properties of a user X  X  offline loca-tion tracks. Proximity encounters can be detected by RFID [Cattuto et al. 2010] or Bluetooth [Kostakos and O X  X eill 2008]. Applications can be built based on proximity such as using proximity frequency for friend recommendations like Aka-Aki [2011], or using proximity encounters to introduce people and infer a user X  X  social network like Serendipity [Eagle and Pentland 2005]. Considering that GPS positioning meth-ods [Cranshaw et al. 2010] have accurate limits (on the order of 50 meters error) that cannot omit the noisy proximities when no interaction is happening, outdoor colocation does not always infer the interaction. We believe that collected proximities through a WiFi-based positioning system such as in the work of de Moraes and Nunes [2006] and our Find and Connect system [Zhu et al. 2010; Chang et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2011a, 2011b] can better present or infer the offline interaction between users.
 To understand social interaction, social selection [Easley and Kleinberg 2010; McPherson et al. 2001] and social influence [Easley and Kleinberg 2010] are often used. The homophily principle [McPherson et al. 2001] states that we tend to connect with similar people and are friends with them, and this contributes to our preferential ties. The fact that people form social ties based on similar characteristics they possess is often termed social selection [McPherson et al. 2001]. In social selection, people may have more opportunities in the social environment to form friendships with other like-minded individuals, due to shared characteristics [Huckfeldt 1983; Robins et al. 2001]. In addition, people adapt their activities and behaviors to be like their friends, which is called social influence [Easley and Kleinberg 2010] and exists in daily life such as consumer desires and behaviors [Dholakia et al. 2004] and technology adoption [Vannoy and Palvia 2010]. The probability of joining an online community, for example, in LiveJournal [Backstrom et al. 2006], editing a Wikipedia article, or attending a conference listed in DBLP [Backstrom et al. 2006], increases linearly as the number of one X  X  friends who are already there increases. The social influence in these works is so strong that a set of friends is about 100 times more powerful in influencing a user to join a group than the same number of strangers. In addition, since individuals in networks affect one another, models of social influence can be built to model complex group dynamics such as the dynamical influence model by Pan and his colleagues [Pan et al. 2010], who capture and use human mobility data from sociometric badges worn by subjects in group discussions to study how influence changes over time.
Among those studies of the underlying correlation between behaviors or interactions and offline proximity, work by Backstrom and his colleagues [Backstrom et al. 2010] shows that Facebook users X  probability of friendship is roughly inversely proportional to their geographic distance at medium-to long-range scale. Bluetooth technologies can be used to define the relative physical closeness and infer the friendship in social selection through encounter duration and frequency such as the work in Eagle and Pentland [2009] and Quercia and Capra [2009]. Recent social sensing systems such as Madan et al. [2010] and Aharony et al. [2011] combine many sensing technologies such as accelerometer and compass, along with messaging and call logs, phone application usage, phone context, social media, surveys, financial status, and location technologies, to comprehensively measure and understand user behavior. These works, however, do not study social influence on physical proximity after social selection is committed. For example, does the physical proximity interaction in a physical environment affect two users in becoming friends? Cranshaw and his colleagues [Cranshaw et al. 2010] study diverse location measurements and propose location entropy to predict the friendship of two users by analyzing their GPS colocation traces, but not in indoor environments. Our system combines a user X  X  location, social events, and social context in the physical world, like in the workplace for managing workplace resources [Zhu et al. 2010] or in the conference room for enhancing conference participation [Chang et al. 2011]. We utilize a user X  X  physical proximity in the form of encounters to broaden a user X  X  social connections by creating an online social network service that suggests people to connect to, based on location and encounter history, and integrate it together with the conference schedule which is presented in a mobile user interface. Our work is most similar to Conferator, a system for enhancing social interaction at conferences [Atzmueller et al. 2011], but differs in that we use WiFi and create an encounter algorithm for discovering potential contacts instead of using RFID tag interactions. We use mobile phones (instead of special hardware sensors), use the indoor WiFi network, and use indoor location to record where attendees are, to provide location-based services such as finding where people are at the conference and where sessions are held, and for establishing social networking connections such as exchanging personal information and communicating with others based on encounters and similarity with others. In this way, we provide a much richer, integrated, and social experience that provides opportunities for users to meet and connect with others. Find and Connect is a platform for providing social networking amongst attendees at a conference or meeting. Users can find where the room, session, and people are on the map and then connect with people by adding them as a connection, sending them a message, or sharing an item with them. We provide the system description and architecture and then explain the features that we created for social networking in two deployments, the UIC/ATC 2010 conference and the GCJK internal marketing meeting. Figure 1 shows the system architecture of Find and Connect. The positioning client col-lects WiFi signal strengths from nearby WiFi access points on a floor and sends them to the Positioning Server. In the Positioning Server, the Positioning engine uses the Positioning Model to approximate the positioning of the user as an (x, y) coordinate ac-cording to the dimensions of the floor. The Positioning Model is created by performing a site survey that involves recording the WiFi signal strengths from WiFi access points on the conference floor. For our implementation, we used an off-the-shelf commercial WiFi positioning system, called the Ekahau Real-Time Location System [Ekahau 2011]. The Browser Client presents the location-based social network services on the mobile phone that is accessed from the Find and Connect application server, while the PC Client shows the visualization of the social network and user presence on a big display. The Log records client requests including time, username and page accessed, and location. More details on the architecture can be found in our previous work [Zhu et al. 2010]. We deployed Find and Connect at the UIC/ATC 2010 conference in Xi X  X n, China in October 2010. This is an international conference for researchers on ubiquitous, in-telligent, and autonomic computing. Find and Connect revolves around the electronic mobile version of the paper-based conference program, similar to previous work where attendees can personalize their schedule [SXSW 2011; Atzmueller et al. 2011], see where the session is [SXSW 2011], see what papers are being presented [Atzmueller et al. 2011], and find other attendees in the conference [Barrat et al. 2010].
However, the novel part of Find and Connect lies in the integration of the social network with the conference program and the location. Find and Connect uses the conference resources as objects for social interaction and connection (in this case, the room, the session, and the paper), and then uses social features within the conference program to facilitate social interaction and connection. We create five functional mod-ules in our Web client (My Agenda, Program, Map, Social Network, and Buzz) and describe the features of each next. 3.2.1. Program and My Agenda. We create a Program screen (Figure 2(a)) for showing the conference program items. Users add program items to My Agenda (Figure 2(d)) by selecting  X  X dd to agenda X  (Figure 2(a)). Users can view the session details and all papers in that session as shown in Figure 2(b), then see a specific paper in that session as shown in Figure 2(c). If users like this paper, they select  X  X avorite this X  and share it with others in the conference, from which others will receive an SMS message indicating the name of the paper that was shared.
 3.2.2. Map. In the Map screen shown in Figure 3, users can see the locations of people who are using this system in the conference. Selecting  X  X earch Online People X  can help them find the locations of the people they want to meet. Users can filter the list of people on the map by showing just friends, people in sessions, or only themselves. By selecting the link of the person in the  X  X ser list X  or on the person icon on the map, users can see that person X  X  profile. By selecting a specific user in the user list, users will see only that person on the map. 3.2.3. Profile and Social Network. The Profile screen is shown in Figure 4(a). When the user selects a friend or a contact that is nearby, that user can look at the contact details, download the contact X  X  business card to the phone, and find out the last encounter time and location. When someone wants to add a user as a friend, she will receive an SMS and then she can decide whether to accept. Users can also choose to follow the person whom they are interested in, similar to follow in Twitter. In the Social Network screen, users can update their status and monitor their social network activity by receiving latest updates from all the people they are following, those that follow them, their friends, and those that Find and Connect recommends to them as friends. We describe the details of the recommendation algorithm in Section 4.3. 3.2.4. Messaging and Buzz. There are three different communication methods in Find and Connect. First, users can send a standard message to one or many users, as shown in Figure 5(a). Second, users can send a location message where the message is sent to only those people in the specified location selected from the  X  X ocation X  dropdown box. If users choose  X  X ocation X , they can select the  X  X xpiration Time X  as to when that message will continue to be sent to people in that room until the expiration time. Third, users can also discuss the various sessions in the conference by posting a message to that session and viewing other people X  X  posts, as shown in Figure 5(b). We call this Buzz and users who post the buzz can also post to LinkedIn for others to view, especially those that did not attend. In this way, this is like an activity-based tweet where it is grouped by session unlike tweets which are unstructured.
 For the GCJK internal marketing event, the objective was to allow users to meet new people and establish connections during the one-day event held in Beijing. Compared to UIC/ATC 2010, the event did not have multitrack sessions, it was held only in one large room, and did not have any papers. Therefore, we concentrated more on the social networking features and developed a simplified version of Find and Connect. The features are similar to the UIC/ATC 2010 conference except there is no Program or My Agenda, we do not use friendship but follow for online social connection, and we added an integrated social network feed to view latest network activity. We show the user interface we implemented in Figure 6 and described in more detail in Xu et al. [2011b]. 3.3.1. Status and Map. As shown in Figure 6(a), attendees can post and edit their latest status and share their status with other users of Find and Connect in the Status section. The Map section shows the location of the current user and also other online attendees whose privacy setting allows location sharing (set by selecting the Privacy button), and is similar to that used in the UIC/ATC 2010 conference. 3.3.2. Profile. Selecting the name of a person on the map will show the person X  X  profile, as shown in Figure 6(b). Users can visit each other X  X  profile, share their location with others (who to share location with is governed by the Privacy), and view where others are and their status. Then, users can connect to that person by following that person and/or exchanging contacts with each other through sending business cards via SMS, where the profile information is converted into a virtual card format (vCard), exactly as in UIC/ATC 2010. Find and Connect also shows whether users have encountered that person. This can then provide the incentive for either following or exchanging contacts with that person. 3.3.3. Network. In the Network section shown in Figure 6(c), users are presented with an aggregated list of all the users that they have a connection with, separated into  X  X ontacts Exchanged X ,  X  X ollowing X  (those that a user follows),  X  X ollowing me X  (those that follow the user), and  X  X ncounters X  (people that have been in close proximity with the user within 4 meters). Finally,  X  X eople You Should Follow X  shows all the people that a user should follow obtained from our recommendation algorithm as described in Section 4.3.
 3.3.4. All Updates. In the All Updates screen as shown in Figure 6(d), users can view all the updates of whom they follow, including their status history, people they follow, and people they exchanged contacts with. This is similar to the Wall feature in Facebook where it provides a feed of all the updated interactions from the user X  X  contacts, from which she can follow their activities and make connections with others. Privacy protection is always an important concern with any mobile social networking application. For Find and Connect, permission was sought from all participants in both trials for collecting and using their data according to standard ethics protocol. We anonymize all data in our analysis, so that we do not identify a specific user. In the Find and Connect client, users can set whether to share their location to others, friends, or just keep it private in their profile. All personal content such as personal messages, encounters, and activity history can only be seen between the two individuals in the conversation or the encounter interaction, and not by others. The encounter history for each attendee is only used in the friend/follow recommendation algorithm, and is not shared with others.

In the next section, we describe our method for determining physical proximity, introduce the concept of encounter, and examine the relationship between offline and online social connections. At any physical event, we have two types of social interaction: offline (physical) and online (virtual). Location-based applications can and do help to bridge this gap between offline and online, and can record and track a user X  X  physical location which makes it possible to study a user X  X  offline activities and her relationship with online activities [Cranshaw et al. 2010]. However, the problem is that the applications are primarily based on GPS location data whose positioning accuracy is within at least 50 meters, the data only records colocation, and cannot be used to record any intense interaction, especially indoor activities. We need to record whether users are physically proximate to each other in order to infer their activity and their offline social interactions.
On the other hand, establishing online social connections, such as adding a friend, is performed manually. For example, currently, one needs to remember to add a person that one just talked with from a conference session to Facebook, rather than the system automatically suggesting that one should add this person on Facebook because it knows one was talking with him (note, it is difficult to say that one is talking with another person, but we can at least infer that one is doing some offline communication if we detect one is close to another for an extended period of time). Therefore, the connection between offline and online currently is not seamless. However, if we record the physical proximities of people to each other, then we can attempt to capture the opportunities where people meet each other in real life, that can also be reflected online so they can still continue their relationship online.

Motivated by Cranshaw and his colleague X  X  work [Cranshaw et al. 2010] where they discovered that users that are colocated together tend to have more online social interactions in Facebook, we also examine whether users that have more physical proximities to others in indoor environments will have more online social interactions. We encounter many people every day and the people that we encounter and meet could present opportunities to make new social connections. This is based on the concept of the  X  X amiliar stranger X  [Paulos and Goodman 2004] where we repeatedly observe and are colocated with, but do not directly interact with a stranger.

In Online Social Networks (OSNs) such as Facebook, our own social network consists of microsocial networks that are most likely created from a specific event or location. We call these microsocial networks Ephemeral Social Networks (ESNs) because the network connections are spontaneous (usually not planned in advance and not sched-uled) and temporary (ephemeral) with people at a specific place or event at a specific time and lasting for a specific duration, similar to ephemeral groups [Wang et al. 2004]. The ephemeral social network can be seen as a time slice of one X  X  overall social network and can be synchronized with the OSN. In addition, ephemeral social networks can bridge the gap between offline and online since the ephemeral social network provides a permanent trace of one X  X  activities, who one meets, and any social interactions, from which one can then interact with those people offline after the event.

For creating an ephemeral social network, we need to first create a proximity graph of all proximity interactions. In Find and Connect, we use encounter as the concept for defining a proximity interaction. We define an encounter if the distance between two people is within the encounter distance threshold and their distance lasts for at least the encounter duration threshold before they move away and are beyond the encounter distance threshold. We decide to use WiFi as the positioning system to record the position, then calculate the distance between any two individuals on the same floor because WiFi is widely available and easy to install. We then create an encounter graph G en ( V , E ), where V is the set of nodes ( v i | 1  X  i  X  N ), N is the number of nodes, and E is the set of edges ( e ij | 1  X  i  X  N , 1  X  j  X  N , i = j )and:  X  X ode v i designates user i , node v j is user j , and the edge e ij is a link when two users ( v i and v j ) encounter each other;  X  X dge ( e ij ) has a timestamp attribute to define when the encounter happens, called
T start ( e ij ) and when the encounter ends, called T stop ( e ij ); and  X  X dge e ij is built only if the encounter distance D en ( e ij ) is less than the encounter distance threshold D and the encounter duration T en ( e ij ) = T stop ( e ij )  X  T start ( e ij ) is larger than T (the time duration threshold that is defined to be an encounter). We then record all the encounters between any two people throughout the entire con-ference duration. The collection of all the encounters forms the encounter network. Note that the encounter is defined as a pairwise proximity interaction, and that by mining the encounter graph, our goal is to identify encounter patterns between groups of people in colocated areas that can possibly indicate the existence of an ephemeral so-cial network. In this article, we study user behavior through offline interactions in the encounter network. We leave the problem of identifying an ephemeral social network from the encounter network to future work. In Find and Connect, people have opportunities to form relationships with other like-minded individuals, due to the shared characteristics that they have, such as common friends, similar profile, and common encounters. If one physically encounters a partic-ular person more often and have longer encounter duration, then this may increase the probability that one will follow this person and also become a friend. The reason why is because there is an attractive force of similarity between both parties, the similarities being that both are at the same place at the same time doing the same activity. In other words, social selection is at play which will influence one X  X  behavior to want to establish a social connection with that person, which one also wants to reflect online by following or becoming that person X  X  friend.

In addition, social influence is at play where users adapt their activities and behav-iors to be accorded with that of their friends. In the UIC/ATC 2010 conference, we determine whether friendship will result in increased physical proximity encounters between people, whereas for the GCJK meeting, we study whether users who have exchanged contacts or have followed each other will result in increased physical prox-imity encounters between them. In other words, if I follow you, become your friend, or exchanged contact with you, will I encounter you even more because I want to have more offline social interactions with you? In order to encourage others to add people to be friends or to follow based on encounters, we created a people recommendation algorithm which we explain next. In Find and Connect, we recommend specific people from the conference or meeting that one should add as a friend or one should follow whom otherwise one may have missed. We create the EncounterMeet + recommendation algorithm for friend/follow recommendations [Xu et al. 2011a], which improves on previous work by combining physical context and content. The recommendations are not necessarily bidirectional because the algorithm works every 10 minutes for each person registered in the system. We describe the following features for the EncounterMeet + algorithm.  X  Common interests (ci) . In the user X  X  profile, users can specify their interests from a predefined list and if one and user B have the same interest then user B may likely be a recommended person for one to be a friend with or follow.  X  Common friends/followers (cf) . This is the common friends algorithm used in popular social networking sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn X  X   X  X eople You May Know X  feature, where if one and user B both have the same friend/follower, then user B can likely be a recommended person for one to be a friend with or follow.  X  Common sessions (cs) . These are the sessions that one and user B both attended during the conference.  X  Encounters (e) .Ifoneanduser B encounter each other several times a day and for several days, then user B may likely be a recommended person that one would want to add as a friend or follow because of one X  X  previous proximity interactions. We described how we calculated an encounter in the previous section.  X  Messages (m) .Ifuser B sends several messages to an individual then user B may likely be a recommended friend for that person or person to follow. We only used this feature for the UIC/ATC 2010 conference.
 From all these features, we describe the EncounterMeet + algorithm.

Define a weight vector w i : for each user U i that EncounterMeet + will recommend potential people for user U to be friends with or to follow, where depending on the importance of each feature to the recommendation, we attach a weight w f to each feature f .
 Next, define the relevance vector R i we have for user U i s relevance to user U in each feature f , where user U i is not in the friend/follow list of user U . Relevance R f is measured by the Jaccard similarity of that feature f between U i and U as where N f refers to the frequency usage or appearance count for that feature. However, other similarity measurements, such as Pearson X  X  coefficient and cosine similarity, can be used to define the relevance between U i and U in each feature space.
 We define the recommended score FR i for recommended friend/follower U i to user U as Find and Connect then uses this score to determine whether a user will be recom-mended to the other as a user pair. We show the top 10 recommended friends in the Recommended section of the Social Network screen (UIC/ATC 2010) and the top 10 recommended people to follow in the Network screen (GCJK) as shown in Figure 7(a), as well as the reasons for adding this person as a friend/follower in Figure 7(b).
We believe that there is a relationship between offline encounters and online social connections via friendship and follow. Our hypothesis is that: (H1) for social selection, more physical interaction, here measured by encounters, will result in an increased probability for a person to create new online social connections in Find and Connect (i.e., to become a friend or to follow someone), and (H2) for social influence, once an online social connection is established, (i.e., contacts have been exchanged or someone has been followed), it will result in an increased frequency of encounters and encounter duration between two individuals. The next section will explain the Find and Connect trials and data analysis for testing out the hypotheses. In this section, we provide the data analysis and results from deploying Find and Connect at the UIC/ATC 2010 conference and GCJK internal marketing event. We first provide a description of the trial, then study the user behavior from Find and Connect by creating a social connection graph where the edge e ij indicates that there is an established social connection between the two users v i and v j , and studying its network properties according to our earlier work [Chang et al. 2011]. We then examine the distribution and the spatial distribution of the user locations on the floor map of the venue, followed by studying the relationship between physical proximity encounters and social connections. 5.1.1. Experimental Design. Find and Connect was piloted in the UIC/ATC 2010 confer-ence for four days during October 2010. In the venue, we used WiFi for the positioning system because: (i) it was easy to deploy because we placed at least one WiFi access point in each room, (ii) the WiFi access points were inexpensive to buy, and (iii) we had previous experience with the WiFi positioning system in our office [Zhu et al. 2010]. To control the user experience and track the WiFi position, we installed the Find and Connect client on 50 Nokia X6 and 50 Nokia 5800 phones for the participants. The trial was advertised on the conference Web site and social networks, and we allowed participants to preregister before the conference to make it simple for them to register and complete their profile beforehand. A total of 112 people registered for the trial, of which 62 users were paper authors and 50 users were nonauthors. We monitor social network activity during the conference by looking at what the users select. For example, if they select  X  X ollow X  or  X  X dd Friend X  or  X  X xchange contacts X , a new relationship be-tween the users is established. For friend requests, we record when the friend requests are sent and whether these requests are accepted. We record the user X  X  position every 10 seconds and calculate the encounters with our encounter algorithm every 5 min-utes. In our database and log, we record the profile, friends, followers, recommended friends, agenda, favorite papers, encounter information, and messages for each user. The friend recommendation algorithm was computed every 10 minutes. Of the 86 of the 112 people surveyed, 73 of them knew at least one person at the conference, therefore a high percentage of 85% already knew people at the conference. 5.1.2. User Behavior Analysis. We study the social connection networks formed from the acceptance of friend requests, follow requests, and exchanged contacts. We also study the encounters recorded between people. The social network properties for each network are listed in Table I. Users connect only with people that are registered and the friend recommendations are only within the participants. The friend network includes also friendship that was established from the friend recommendations.

For the friend network, 59% (257/436) of all friend requests are accepted. A total of 2829 friend recommendations are generated during the whole trial, and 274 of them are added as a friend request by 35 unique users, resulting in 10% of total friend recommendations being converted into friend requests. Authors significantly dominate the friend network with 55 users. For the encounter network, the encounter distance threshold is 4 meters. We choose 4 meters because, according to Hall [1963], proxemic behavior is anything between 1.2 m and 3.6 m, so the maximum rounds up to 4.
We use the following network properties to characterize each of the social networks formed in Find and Connect as they are the most frequently used [Wasserman and Faust 1994]. Density is the proportion of ties in a network relative to the total number possible (sparse versus dense networks). Average shortest path is defined as the aver-age number of steps along the shortest paths for all possible pairs of network nodes. Diameter is the maximum length of all shortest paths between any two connected nodes. Average clustering coefficient is a measure of degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together, which relates to a subgroup X  X  Group Betweenness Centraliza-tions (GBC range: 0 &lt; GBC &lt; 1), where GBC = 0 when all the nodes have exactly the same betweeness index and GBC = 1 when one node falls on all other geodesics between all the remaining (N-1) nodes. This is exactly the situation realized by a star graph.
The numbers of people who are involved in the friend, exchanged contacts, and follow networks are similar. The number of links in the follow network is less than those of the friend network and the exchanged contacts network. The friend and exchanged contacts networks are much denser than the follow network, have a smaller diameter, are more highly clustered with a larger clustering coefficient, and have similar average shortest path length. This means that both the friend and exchanged contacts networks are tighter and more intimate than the follow network due to the reciprocity of friend requests and exchanged contacts, which is not a surprise. There is a sense of closeness with friends and exchanging contacts in establishing an offline relationship that is recorded online. We discover that people mostly friend other people, rather than follow or exchange contacts, because people want to establish strong social connections with others. This is most often done through friendship and is a two-way strong social connection (on the basis of which they can decide to exchange contacts). Follow is more for just casual interaction and is a loose one-way connection, but has no strong influence like friendship. There is less incentive to follow, because there is no reward for following someone. Therefore, in the following analysis we concentrate on friendship as the mutual social link and study its relationship to physical proximity. 5.1.3. Location Updates. From the trial, a total of 83 users uploaded 1,430,121 locations. Figure 8(a) shows the distribution of the location updates by every user that appears to follow an exponentially decreasing distribution (or long-tail distribution). In the head of the distribution, we see that only a few users are constantly online and update their position heavily, while the tail of the distribution shows that many users do not update their position as frequently. Aggregated positioning of users over the 4 days is shown in Figure 8(b) on the map that shows the locales that had the most active presence of users, which were the ballroom and corridors in between rooms during the breaks. 5.1.4. Relationship of Physical Proximity on Friend Formation. We want to see whether hav-ing greater encounter duration with a user will increase the probability of becoming a friend with that user. Here, we use encounters to represent offline proximity and use friendship formation as the online social connection, as this was what most people used. For the selection of encounter distance threshold, as mentioned earlier, we originally choose 4 m as in our earlier work [Wang et al. 2011]. However, considering that the positioning error in the Find and Connect positioning system is 5 m (from our experi-ence), the maximum encounter distance error could be 10 m, meaning the encounter distance could range from 0 to 14 m. Therefore, we determine the maximum encounter distance threshold, by plotting the distribution of the total number of encounters de-fined by different encounter distance thresholds as shown in Figure 9. The result shows that the maximum total number of encounters occurs at 10 m, and then the encounter numbers decrease with increasing threshold, therefore we select 10 m as the maximum encounter distance threshold and compare it to our original threshold of 4 m.
Figure 10 shows the cumulative total encounter duration averaged per pair of encountered users at each discrete time unit (30 minutes) before and after the time 0 point when the friend request was sent, with the encounter distance threshold of 4mand10m.

We can see similar trends for both curves of encounter distance threshold of 4 m and 10 m. The trends can be divided into four phases.  X  Phase I. More than 2 hours before the friendship connection is established, the cumulative average total encounter duration is very small and rises very slowly. In the beginning, one does not know many people therefore there is no online social selection.  X  Phase II. Around 2 hours before the friend request until time 0 when the friend request is sent, the cumulative average total encounter duration rises to be con-siderably large. As one begins to meet people, one X  X  encounters with a given person increase as well as does the encounter duration, thus causing one to know more about this person and add this person as a friend. Social selection on physical proximity in becoming friends is strong here.
  X  Phase III. Around 2 hours after the friend request has been sent, the cumulative average total encounter duration continues to rise but at a higher rate than before.
After becoming friends, people want to know more about their work so it is natural to continue to have more offline interactions, thus short-term social influence is strong.  X  Phase IV . More than 2 hours after time 0 when the friend request is sent, the average cumulative total encounter duration continues to rise but the curve starts to stabilize and flatten out. The frequency of encounters is less and encounter durations are smaller, and since the social connection has been established, users spend less time being physically proximate to each other, causing long-term social influence to be weak.
 The preceding behavior reflects the actual behavior of users at a conference where the intention is to meet more people. This agrees with our hypothesis (H1) that greater physical proximity encounter duration results in an increased probability for a person to add someone as a friend online. However, contrary to our original hypothesis (H2), after users have established a friendship, the probability of users being physically proximate to each other decreases. In addition, the cumulative average total encounter duration defined by a threshold of 10 m is higher than the one defined by the threshold of 4 m. This is because when we choose a bigger threshold value, more colocation will be included and this makes the total encounter duration longer. For encounter frequency and friendship connection establishment, there is an increasing number of encounters on average, which shows that social selection on physical proximity has a positive effect on the formation of online friendship. After establishing the friendship, the average encounter number per pair of users starts to decrease, showing that after people become friends they tend to encounter each other less than before. Due to page limitations, we do not show the graph here. Therefore, physical proximity and friendship in Find and Connect are correlated in terms of both cumulative average total encounter duration and average encounter frequency. 5.2.1. Experimental Design. Find and Connect was deployed at an internal marketing event (called GCJK) for one day on April 13, 2011 in Beijing at the main meeting room of a conference hotel with 8 WiFi access points placed in various locations in the room. The marketing event was single track and divided into 19 activities. Users were encouraged to download and use the Find and Connect client throughout the event, where a total of 76 users downloaded and used the client. For the event, we relaxed the social linking to be one-way follow instead of two-way friendship to allow more users to feel comfortable in using the social features of our software. Here, users connect only with people that are registered and the follow recommendations are only within the participants. In our database and log, we record the profile, exchanged contacts, followers, encounter information, status, and location for each user, similarly to the UIC/ATC 2010 conference. 5.2.2. User Behavior Analysis. We study the social connection networks formed from the follow and exchanged contacts requests. The follow network includes followship that was established from the follow recommendation. The social network properties for each network in the GCJK event are listed in Table I.

For the exchanged contacts network, people mostly exchange contacts not during the actual main talks, but after, during the lunch and leisure periods. For the encounter network, similar to the UIC/ATC 2010 conference, we choose 4 m as the encounter distance threshold.

From Table I, the encounter network has similar number of users as the follow net-work, but has nearly 5 times the number of links as the follow network. Also, the encounter network has almost 2 times the number of users as the exchanged con-tacts network, and more than 10 times the number of links as the exchanged contacts network. In addition, the encounter network has the highest clustering coefficient and highest density, which indicates that the encounter network is the most tightly connected, as expected. All these results show that the encounter network is better connected. Comparing the two online social networks, we observe that although the follow network is at a larger scale than the exchanged contacts network, the follow network is less dense than the exchanged contacts network. While the average cluster-ing coefficient and network diameter are quite similar, this means that the exchanged contacts network and the follow network have equal levels of connection ties, while the follow network is larger than the exchanged contacts network. 5.2.3. Location Updates. A total of 76 users uploaded 6632 locations. Figure 11(a) shows the distribution of the location updates by every user, which appears to follow an exponentially decreasing distribution with the head of the distribution (less than 5 users) having an excessive amount of location updates, while the majority in the long tail has less than 100 location updates. Aggregated positioning of users and their locations in the main meeting room is shown in Figure 11(b), and we find that the aggregated positioning points correspond to the activities going on. Most people were in the center of the room where the talks were held, and it actually shows the setup of the environment for the talks (the aisles for the chairs) and where the demos were located. 5.2.4. Relationship of Physical Proximity on Exchanged Contacts and Follow. Based on the for-mer discussion of encounter threshold in the UIC/ATC 2010 conference data analysis, we choose two different thresholds in the definition of encounters, namely 4 m and 10 m. Using similar methodology, we first give the cumulative total encounter duration averaged per pair of users at each discrete time unit (30 minutes) before and after a follow connection is formed, and before and after contacts were exchanged, using different thresholds of 4 m and 10 m. This is shown in Figure 12.

First, for an encounter defined by a threshold of 4 m, we can see that the lines of exchanged contacts and follow have similar trends that can be divided into three phases described next.  X  Phase I . More than 2 hours before any online social connection request (exchanged contacts or follow), the cumulative average total encounter duration is very small and rises very slowly.  X  Phase II. Around 2 hours before the online social connection request until time 0 when the online social connection request is sent, the cumulative average total encounter duration rises sharply to be considerably large.
  X  Phase III . After time 0 when the online social connection request is sent (exchanged contacts or follow), the average total encounter duration decreases which causes the cumulative average total encounter duration curve to stabilize and flatten out. Similar to the UIC/ATC 2010 conference, this trend suggests that social selection on physical proximity in exchanged contacts and follow is strong (Phase II), however, social influence is weak (Phase III). This agrees with our hypothesis (H1) that a greater physical proximity encounter duration results in an increased probability for a person to follow another individual, or to exchange their contacts with. However, contrary to our original hypothesis (H2), after users have established an online social relationship, the probability of users being physically proximate to each other decreases. The reason for this behavior is similar to the UIC/ATC 2010 conference results. If user X just wants to exchange contacts with user Y (get the business card of user Y), user X will spend less time in close proximity with user Y because once she has the business card, she has a means for contacting the other offline. However, people tend to follow others if they have spent more time in close proximity with them, therefore follow appears to be a much stronger link between users in a user pair than exchanged contacts.
However, this three-phase trend does not apply for those encounters defined by threshold of 10 m, where there is a sharp rise in duration at around 4 hours after the social connection is established both for exchanged contacts and follow. We find that most follow and exchanged contacts activities occur shortly after this introduction, and the 4 hours corresponds to the one-hour break when people browsed through the demos in the room. As discussed previously, the choice of encounter distance threshold is important because too large of a threshold will include many colocations into the encounter set. This can perhaps explain the fact that for two kinds of user pairs, the duration lines of encounters defined by a threshold of 4 m do not sharply rise around time point 4, compared with a threshold of 10 m. Therefore, we do not use a threshold of 10 m in the next part of our analysis.

Similar to the UIC/ATC 2010 conference, aside from the duration of encounters, we also study the correlation between encounter frequency and online social connection establishment. We calculate the average number of encounters per user pair in discrete time intervals, before and after their respective behaviors are committed, for different types of user pairs (i.e., follow and exchanged contacts), but due to space limitations we omit the figure here. The results are similar to that of the UIC/ATC 2010 conference, where social selection on physical proximity has a positive effect on the formation of online social connection, and social influence on physical proximity is weak after the connection is made. Moreover, user pairs with followship have more encounters than user pairs with contacts exchanged, which agrees with the results from the cumula-tive average total encounter duration. Therefore, online social behavior and physical proximity of users in Find and Connect are also correlated in terms of both average encounter duration and encounter frequency for the GCJK trial. Although it is difficult to compare between the two preceding trials as they were con-ducted at different times and different places, nonetheless, according to the character-istics of the events, the properties of their social networks do change. From Table I, we find that there are differences between the UIC/ATC 2010 conference and GCJK event. The networks established during the UIC/ATC 2010 conference generally have higher degree, higher density, and shorter average path length among respective parameters than in the GCJK event, indicating that the social networks formed are more dense and more tightly coupled. The UIC/ATC 2010 conference lasted three days with more participants than the GCJK conference, which lasted only one day with less partici-pants. Additionally, the user intent and behavior were different. Since UIC/ATC 2010 was an international academic conference, people tended to meet more people that they did know but did not physically meet before. However, the GCJK event was an internal business meeting, so the attendees were not as interested to add others into their social network because they could be easily found in the company address book and the people already knew each other. Despite these differences, the results are as expected, confirming the utility and user behavior in Find and Connect. In this article, we examined the problem of how resources in the physical environ-ment can be used to help facilitate social networking and vice versa. Specifically, we investigated the two research questions, of how social connections can be established and integrated with physical resources in a conference through positioning technology, and how physical proximity can affect and be affected by online social connections. Furthermore, we investigated whether this relationship can be used to establish and extend users X  social networks both online and offline. We built Find and Connect to address these questions and conducted two trials, one at the UIC/ATC 2010 conference and one at the GCJK internal marketing event.

Results from our analysis show that social connection features that are reciprocal in relationship, such as friendship and exchanged contacts, have tighter, denser, and highly clustered networks compared to unidirectional relationships such as follow. We discover that for the relationship between physical proximity and social connection, hypothesis H1 is supported. This hypothesis states that greater physical proximity in encounter duration and frequency will increase the probability for a person to add someone as a friend or follow online due to social selection. However, hypothesis H2 is not supported. After online connections are established, more online social interactions result in a decreased duration and frequency of offline interactions between individuals and social influence is weak.

However, there are limitations to our work. The results need to be taken with a grain of salt, because we do not know the exact reason as to why a user adds a friend, which means the encounters may have nothing to do with this. Moreover, our dataset is sparse compared to other online social networks and other proximity datasets that use GPS or Bluetooth. Nonetheless, it is interesting to see how encounters might affect the decision for a user to add a friend, which the analysis demonstrates. For future work, we intend to study in more detail the effect of encounters on recommendations and determine the reasons why users add friends by asking this question when they add a friend. In addition, we intend to create an algorithm for mining the encounters and discovering encounter patterns for identifying ephemeral social networks.
