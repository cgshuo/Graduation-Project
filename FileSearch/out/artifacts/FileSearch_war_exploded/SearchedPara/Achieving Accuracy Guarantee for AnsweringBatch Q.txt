 Differential privacy (DP), is a promising strategy for providing privacy for data ferential privacy is to insert noises to the query outputs [ 4 ]. Currently, most of the related work focus on privacy protection but don X  X  further analyze how useful of the noisy results. If these noise results show what level of accuracy can be achieved, they will help data analysts further investigate and improve the effectiveness of them. Moreover, the privacy allocation is very important to how useful of the noisy results. To answer multiple queries, a simple way is to may cause some noisy results to be unmeaningful due to large noise magnitude relative to the original results.
 dataset, extracted from UCI machine learning repository [ 2 ], has 32 viduals. Suppose we want to use two queries q =[ q 1 ,q 2 to infer the real values of the whole population, where q of individuals with Sex= X  X ale X , Race= X  X lack X  and Income= X  number of individuals with Sex= X  X ale X  and Income= X  &gt; 50K X , which is equal to 0.0446; q 2 is the proportion of individuals with Sex= X  X ale X , Race= X  X hite X  Income= X  &gt; 50K X , which is equal to 0.9140.
 than that from q 2 (i.e. 0.9140). Under the aforementioned  X  X niformly split X  Correspondingly, the noise magnitude for q 1 will be larger compared with its smaller value, making its noisy result less useful, although the could be relatively close to its true value. Ideally, we should assign a higher be added to q 1 , making both of them are useful. As such, how to reasonably allocate the limited privacy budget to multiple queries is a crucial problem to ensure the overall accuracy guarantee for all the queries.
 For the impact of noise on the noisy results, while most existing work provide results if they can visualize the level of accuracy achieved after adding noise. The objective of this research is thus to design a framework to allocate privacy budget among the queries with differential privacy and further provides analysis of how useful of the noisy results. We have further investigated the framework proposed by A. Smith [ 14 ]. We consider the problem of multiple queries with -differential privacy under this framework, where the queries studied in the paper are the ratios of multiple subsets to the given dataset. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:  X  We formulate the optimization problem with accuracy guarantee in terms of confidence interval (CI). This enables data analysts to better understand what are the accuracy guarantee of the noisy statistical results.  X  We formulate the noisy results with normal-Laplace distribution. This prop-erty enables us to derive its cumulative distribution function (i.e. cdf).  X  We further approximate the minimum privacy budget required for given level of accuracy with explicit formulas.
 The remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows: First, section 2 pro-vides a brief discussion about the related work. Then, we describe the background approximation formulas for accuracy guarantee. Finally, we evaluate the proposed approach and conclude the paper in section 6 and section 7 respectively. Currently, most of existing work studied the noise reduction in terms of sen-sitivity. For example, a data publishing technique, Privelet , based on wavelet but also guarantees that the variance of the noisy results is polylogarithmic in terms of m where m denotes the number of queries. There are some database/ or the dataset is distributively collected. For such types of the applications, a differential privacy framework, PASTE, was proposed in [ 12 ]. To provide dif-ferential privacy for time-series data, PASTE developed a Fourier perturbation algorithm. For the case of absence of a trusted central server, PASTE used a distributed Laplace perturbation algorithm to guarantee differential privacy. In order to publish cuboids for data cubes with small noise, an efficient method was proposed in [ 5 ]. The proposed method ensures that the maximal noise in all published cuboids will be within a factor (ln |L| +1) |L| is the number of cuboids to be published. To handle the problem of differen-tial private data release for a class of counting queries, a new computationally efficient method based on learning thresholds was proposed in [ 9 ]. A few related work on this topic have been investigated. For example, K. Nissim et al. have proposed a framework, subsample and aggregate, to reduce the noise magnitude [ 11 , 14 ]. In such a framework, the dataset is first divided into Definition 1 ([ 15 ]). Two databases x , x  X  D n are neighbouring databases if they differ on exactly one record, i.e., From the definition, note that two neighbouring databases differ only one record while they have the same cardinality. Before discussing the Laplace mechanism, we first give the definition of -differential privacy proposed by Dwork [ 8 ]. Definition 2 ([ 8 ]). With &gt; 0 , a randomized algorithm satisfy -differential privacy, if for any two neighbouring databases and for any subset of outputs S  X  Range ( K ) , the following condition holds: where the probability is taken over the randomness of K . A simple way to achieve -differential privacy is to insert noise to the true value. For instance, the Laplace mechanism (LM) generates the noise by using a random variable of Laplace distribution with mean equal to 0 and scale param-eter equal to S T / ,where S T is the sensitivity of T ( X Definition 3 ([ 11 ]). The sensitivity of a function T : D Lemma 1 (Laplace Mechanism [ 8 ]). Given &gt; 0 , a statistic its sensitivity S T , the noisy result satisfies -differential privacy.
 For the convenience of discussion, we define the Laplace mechanism with accu-racy guarantee as follows.
 Definition 4 (Accuracy Guarantee). Let  X   X  R l be the true value of the dom variable of Laplace distribution with mean equal to 0 and scale parameter equal to S T / . If there exist d =( d 1 ,...,d l ) &gt; 0 and such that then the noisy results obtained from Eq. ( 3 )isatleast 100(1 the true value  X  .
 Note that the accuracy achieved by LM may be smaller than the required accuracy since there exists estimation error between the statistic the variance of the Laplace noise is considered here). We need to find a more accurate formula to describe the relationships among the accuracy achieved and other related parameters in order to ensure the accuracy achieved is close to the required accuracy. Specifically, we focus on the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which is obtained by maximizing the likelihood function. Theorem 1 (Asymptotic Distribution). Let x 1 ,x 2 ,...,x n identically distributed with density f ( x |  X  ) , X   X   X  and let of  X  . Suppose the MLE estimator of  X  0 is T ( x ) . Then the probability distribution of tends to be a standard normal distribution, i.e., where I (  X  0 ) is Fisher information.
 In this section, we first formulate the optimization problem and then show the relationship between the problem and normal-Laplace distribution. 4.1 Problem Definition queries with accuracy requirements to the database server, then the database server passes the requirements to the computing server to optimize the param-eters such as privacy budget and confidence interval in order to minimize the based on the optimized parameters and returns users the noisy results with accuracy description.
 where D is a value space of x i . Here, we use the capital letter to denote a random vector variable and lower case x =( x 1 denote a specific value in D n . Suppose X =( X 1 ,...,X n the distribution f ( x |  X  ), where  X   X  R l is unknown parameter vector. Let be the estimator of  X  . In this paper, we study the problem of how to ensure that the parameter estimations under -differential privacy satisfy the given level of precision. In other words, we wish to estimate  X  using an estimator based on the given dataset x =( x 1 ,...,x n )  X  D n with  X  =[  X  1 ,..., X  be  X  d , where d =[ d 1 ,...,d l ], of the true value  X  0 the expected squared deviation from the real parameter  X  . Specifically, we wish to minimize the following objective function: where total is the total privacy budget and k is the number of blocks. In order tionships among the privacy budget, the number of blocks, the statistics of the data and accuracy guarantee. Without loss of generality, we assume the solution consider in this paper are the ratios of multiple subsets to the given dataset. Specifically, suppose users send queries Q 1 ( q ,  X  ), where q =[ tes the query vector while  X  represents the corresponding accuracy constraints. The database server then passes the queries with privacy budget, ), where  X  denotes the required statistics of related dataset for parameter optimization, to the computing server. It optimizes the privacy budget among the with optimized parameters, Q 3 ( q ,  X  , , X  ), where =[ 1 execution server. Finally, the execution server executes the queries according to given optimized parameters and returns the noisy results, example to show how is the process of our proposed model.

It is an effective method to decrease the noise magnitude, where it randomly divides the data set into estimates are aggregated by using a differentially private function. Especially, the MLE estimator developed by Algorithm 1 [ 15 ] can asymptotically appro-ach the true value  X  0 .
 Lemma 2 ([ 15 ]). Algorithm 1 satisfies -differential privacy.
 Algorithm 1. An -Differential Privacy Algorithm 4.3 The Normal-Laplace Distribution Suppose an MLE estimator is used to estimate the ratios of multiple subsets to a given dataset in Algorithm 1 . Then the output T  X  is the summation of two independent random variables Z and Y , where Z is drawn from the normal distribution with N (E  X  ( T ( X )) , Var( T ( X ))) and Y bution [ 13 ]. In general, let W = Z + Y , where Z and Y are independent random variables with Z  X  N (  X ,  X  2 )and Y with following an asymmetric Laplace dis-tribution with pdf The distribution of W is called normal-Laplace distribution. We use to denote such a distribution.
 and variance of W as A closed-form expression for the cumulative distribution function of the normal-Laplace distribution can be expressed as [ 13 ] with  X  1 =  X  X   X  ( W  X   X  ) / X  and  X  2 =  X  X  +( W  X   X  ) / X  , where cdf and the pdf of a standard normal random variable, respectively. ratio . Suppose  X  and  X  are the mean and standard deviation of variable T ( X )= 1 n n i =1 X i be the estimator of  X  . The noisy result is derived from Algo-rithm 1 . We approximate the minimum privacy budget required for given level confidence interval requires complete information about the distribution of the variable. However, this information is not available in practice. Note that it is is to construct confidence interval based on the large sample theory. Suppose nI (  X   X  )(  X   X   X   X  That is, we can get an approximate 100(1  X   X  )% confidence interval such that Infinite Case. Consider the population is infinite. Let X X has a normal, bell-shaped frequency distribution. We wish to estimate the mean of the population subject to the following constraint where s  X   X  = 1  X  sample size by where d is the desired absolute error and s is the standard deviation. Suppose X  X  X L (  X ,  X  2 characterize the accuracy guarantee as Given accuracy requirement and dataset size, minimum the privacy budget required is expressed as Finite Case. When the population is finite, the accuracy guarantee is different. Suppose the population is N . We need to derive explicit formula to express the relationships among those parameters discussed above for given level of precision 1  X   X  .Let x for estimation. Let p i  X  X  0 , 1 } be the indicator variable. a given sample. Then we can see that n i =1 X i = N i =1 p Y  X  X L (0 , 1 , k expressed as Here, we also derive similar function such that for the minimum privacy budget required.
 of the privacy budget, number of blocks and dataset size. These formulas charac-terize how the parameters affect mutually. Thus, we can solve the optimization conduct simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of them. In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm (denoted as NL) by comparing it with two state-of-the-art mechanisms, including LM evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm based on a synthetic data and a real dataset. Then we further study the privacy budget allocation for the optimization problem in Eqs. ( 5 )-( 8 ). 6.1 Approximation Formulas Evaluation We evaluate the relationships among accuracy, dataset size and privacy budget with binomial distribution and dataset size n 1 = 200 and Carlo method. Two cases are considered, where p =0 . 4. We wish to estimate the mean here. Then we test the cumulative accuracy of noisy results derived from Algorithm 1 falling into the given interval with d =0 of generations is set to 1000. The results are shown in Figure 2 , where NL and MC denote the theoretical results obtained by the proposed algorithm and the true results obtained by Monte Carlo method, LM and GUPT are the results obtained by Laplace mechanism and the GUPT algorithm, respectively. From the above figure, the accuracy increases with the increase of .The results obtained by NL are the most close to those of MC. Especially in the case of high accuracy. In contrast, the theoretical accuracy obtained by LM is much higher than the true accuracy while the theoretical accuracy obtained by GUPT is much lower. This demonstrates that NL is able to achieve higher accurate estimation than the two state-of-the-art techniques.
 Next, we employ a real dataset, (i.e., Adult dataset from UCI dataset), to further prove the correctness of the approximation for finite case. Consider the estimation of the proportion of individuals with race= X  X lack X  and sex= X  X emales X  with income= X  &gt; 50K X  in terms of race= X  X lack X  and income= X  total number of individuals with race= X  X lack X  and income= X  387. We first randomly select n 1 = 100 and n 2 = 200 samples from the 387 individuals. Then we calculate the theoretical accuracy by using NL, LM and GUPT for different privacy budget.
 The results are shown in Figure 3 . The results are very similar to the infi-nite cases, as shown in Figure 2 . This means that the proposed NL algorithm accurately characterizes the relationships among the three parameters. 6.2 Privacy Budget Allocation for Multiple Queries We further investigate the expected squared estimation errors of multiple queries from the optimization problem in Eqs. ( 5 )-( 8 )). We consider two queries with cases with different dataset size. It can be observed that the expected squared errors obtained from different cases decrease with the increasing ularly, given a total , the expected squared errors decrease with the increasing dataset size. Figure 4 (b) shows the comparison of the corresponding privacy bud-to q the privacy allocated to it decreases while the privacy allocated to algorithm accurately describes the relationships among the parameters, namely the privacy budget varies with the accuracy requirement. In this paper, we have investigated the problem of how to allocate privacy budget among a batch of queries under the differential privacy framework. Particularly, we formulated the level of accuracy in terms of privacy budget and dataset size, and we proposed a novel NL algorithm to determine the optimal privacy budget for the given accuracy guarantee. We further derived explicit formulas to accurately characterize the relationships among three parameters.
