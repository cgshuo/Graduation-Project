Visual target recognition is de fi ned as the action of recognizing pre-de fi ned patterns or objects in images obtained by visual sensors ( Daugman, 1993 ). Applications of visual target recognition technology span areas including automatic drive ( Dickmanns et al., 1990 ), unmanned aerial vehicle navigation ( Temel and Unaldi, 2014 ), human motion detection ( Chaquet et al., 2013 ), medical image analysis ( Chen et al., 2013 ), automatic license plate recogni-tion ( Chang et al., 2004 ), etc. To achieve reliable results, high accuracy, robustness, and computational ef fi ciency are the require-ments for the target recognition approaches ( Veredas et al., 2009 ).
This work focuses on shape matching, which is a major branch of target recognition.

Existing shape matching methods can be divided into three categories in general: approaches making direct use of image pixel values; approaches based on low-level features (such as edges, corners or curves); and approaches using high-level features (such as identi fi ed objects or relations among features) ( Borgefors, 1988 ). Pixel-based methods are generally less robust than other methods on account of their inability to accommodate changes in illumination, colors, etc. Methods that use high-level features require the establishment of application-dependent models. As a result, methods of this kind usually lack suf fi cient generalizability. In comparison, target-matching approaches based on low-level features do not have such shortcomings. Despite the fact that low-level features do not re fl ect complete image information, they make for a good tradeoff between robustness and generalizability, and therefore are regarded as the most ef fi cient class of shape matching methods ( Yoo et al., 2013 ). Edge matching is an impor-tant and popular type of low-level-feature shape matching because the edges of shapes are known as a semantically rich and simple representation of the contents of images ( Dao et al., 2007 ).

Generally, a visual shape matching process consists of three steps: feature extraction; similarity measurement; and a search process for the best solutions ( Khan et al., 2014 ). In an edge matching process, feature extraction refers to extracting the edge-structure features (i.e., the contours) from a test image. Following this, a method is needed to measure the similarity between the contours extracted in the test image and a pre-de fi ned template contour. Based on the measure of similarity, a search process is implemented for the optimal geometric transformation that makes the template contour best match with one of the contours extracted from the test image. By describing the geometric transformation using several independent parameters (e.g., hor-izontal translation, vertical translation, rotation and rescaling), the search process can be regarded as a multivariable optimization problem.

Edge-based methods have been extensively investigated for dec-ades. Barrow et al. (1977) fi rst advocated the concept of chamfer matching. This method compares two sets of contour points that belong to a template image and a test image. The best match between the two sets can be optimized by minimizing a generalized distance between them ( Brown, 1992 ). Not long after, the famous concept of
Hausdorff distance was proposed ( Huttenlocher et al., 1993 ), which reliably re fl ects the similarity between two contours regardless of exposure or color excursion in the images. In a sense, these methods pursue an ef fi cient evaluation of the distance (i.e., the degree of similarity) between two shapes. Edge potential function (EPF) is a recently proposed approach that describes such a distance on the basis of a potential fi eld concept ( Dao et al., 2007 ). It is inspired by the generation of electric potentials among charged elements in electro-magnetism. In this method, the pixels on the contours extracted from a test image are regarded as charged elements that establish a potential fi eld. The derived potential fi eld tends to attract a target contour extracted from a pre-de fi ned template image. The more a contour in the test image matches the pre-de fi ned template contour, the greater the attraction is. Therefore, optimal geometrical transfor-mation maximizes this attraction. The EPF approach ef fi ciently exploits the joint effect of contour points by s imultaneously taking the contour positions, the contour strengths, and the contour continuity into account ( Battisti et al., 2012 ). However, a noisy background in a test image may affect the performance of the EPF approach. Furthermore, the computational load of ca lculating such a potential fi heavy, especially when the test image is large in size. As a result, the EPF approach has only been applied to a limited number of cases. concept of atomic potential function (APF) is introduced in this paper. Based on APF, an improved edge-based method for shape recognition is developed, which can ef fi ciently identify the target contours hiding in complex background noises. In our proposed
APF approach, a potential fi eld is generated on the basis of the target contour in the template image instead of contours extracted from the test image. Moreover, this potential fi eld is calculated using the atomic potential function, which has better noise rejection ability than the EPF approach.

A number of studies related to the search process for para-meters corresponding to the optimal geometrical transformation have been conducted ( Abdel-Kader et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2013;
Cuevas et al., 2013; Chaaraoui and Fl X rez-Revuelta, 2014; Elboher and Werman, 2013; Gao et al., 2013 ). It should be noted that such an optimization problem is NP-hard ( Siddiqi et al., 1999 ), is unsolvable in polynomial time and, therefore, requires ef searching algorithms. The arti fi cial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a popular optimization approach motivated by the foraging behavior of bee swarms ( Karaboga, 2005 ). Compared to other optimization methods, the main advantageous feature of ABC is that it conducts both local exploitation and global exploration in each iteration to guarantee searching accuracy. There is a wide variety in applica-tions of the ABC algorithm, including reliable deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence design ( Chaves-Gonz X lez et al., 2013 ), eco-nomic scheduling ( Banharnsakun et al., 2012 ), structure optimiza-tion ( Sun et al., 2013 ), etc. However, previous studies on the ABC algorithm seldom made use of the convergence information available in the current iteration to guide subsequent searches.
In the conventional ABC algorithm, the only module providing feedback information is the roulette selection strategy, which cannot properly re fl ect the internal convergence status. To better consider the internal status, an internal feedback arti fi colony (IF-ABC) algorithm has been proposed ( Li et al., 2014 ).
In IF-ABC, the convergence ef fi ciency of one nectar source depends not on the corresponding function value, but on whether a bee fi nds a nectar source better than the current one. Compared to conventional ABC, IF-ABC effectively avoids premature conver-gence. In this paper, IF-ABC is adopted to search for the transfor-mations that match the most based on the APF method.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , we brie fl y review the principle of the EPF method. Section 3 consists of an account of the motivations for and the concept of our proposed APF approach. The procedure for IF-ABC-based target matching optimization is introduced in Section 4 , followed by several comparison experiments in Section 5 to show the advan-tages of the APF method over the EFP approach. Finally, we discuss our conclusions in Section 6 . 2. Principle of EPF
The EPF approach was motivated by the idea of the Coulomb force between two charged particles. According to the principles of electromagnetism, a set of point charges in a homogeneous back-ground generates a potential fi eld; the intensity of which depends on the charge distribution (i.e., the measure of electric charge per unit volume of space) ( White, 1951 ). This concept has been introduced to the fi eld of visual target recognition to describe the attraction-based fi eld generated by contours in the test image ( Dao et al., 2007 ). The details are as follows.

Suppose that the test image consists of a number of contour and N refers to the total number of the pixels constituting the contours. Each contour point i is regarded as an electric particle with charge Q eq  X  x i ; y i  X  , which contributes to the entire potential fi eld. The potential value in such a potential fi eld at the observation point  X  a ; b  X  can be described as EPF  X  a ; b  X  X  1 4  X  X   X  where  X  is a constant affecting the amplitude of the potential values in the fi eld. For simplicity, it is usually assumed that each particle is charged equally, i.e., Q eq  X  x i ; y i  X  Q . Therefore EPF  X  a ; b  X  X  Q 4  X  X   X 
The potential fi eld is a re fl ection of the contours in the test image. After the potential fi eld is generated, a search process for the most matching transformation is carried out. It is assumed that the contour extracted from the template image and the underlying objective contour in the test image differ for rotation  X  horizontal translation t h , the vertical translation t v Once the template contour transforms as  X   X  n ; t h n ; t this transformed template contour are mapped to the derived potential fi eld. The concerned potential values are then summed up by an index, named Simi , which is a measure of matching similarity. When the optimal solution is obtained, i.e.  X   X  n ; t h n ;  X  ; t h ; t v ; s , Simi is maximized. The value of the similarity index Simi between the derived potential fi eld and the transformed tem-plate is calculated as follows: Simi  X  1 M  X  M where M denotes the total number of pixel points on the transformed template contour, and the position set f X  x i ; y i  X  ; i  X  1 all contour points.

The complete EPF procedure is demonstrated with an example shown in Fig. 1 and described in detail by the fl ow chart in Fig. 2 .
An original test image (see Fig. 1 (a)) and a pre-de fi ned template image are loaded to start with. The contours contained in the template image and the test image are then extracted. For this step, commonly used contour extraction methods such as Canny ( Canny, 1986 ), Prewitt ( Prewitt, 1970 ) and Sobel ( Sobel, 1970 ) can be adopted. The details of contour extraction algorithms are not discussed here for reasons of length and the focus of our paper.
Interested readers should refer to the papers cited above. It may be also noted that a template image is sometimes directly pre-de fi ned in a contour form. In such a situation, the contour extraction step is unnecessary (see Fig. 1 (b)). In the EPF approach, the contours contained in the test image form a so-called edge map (see Fig. 1 (c)). After an edge map is created (using the Canny method in this case), a potential fi eld (see Fig. 1 (d), where to 1) can be generated accordingly. Fig. 1 (e) shows the matching process, where the template contour is rotated 180 1 as an example.
The pixel points on the transformed template contour are then mapped to the potential fi eld to calculate the Simi value. Obviously, the template contour is not transformed to the optimal position in
Fig. 1 (e), whereas Fig. 1 (f) shows the optimal transformation. 3. Principle of APF 3.1. Motivations main advantage of EPF is that it captures the joint effect of continuous charges aligned over coherent structures to guarantee a reliable matching result ( Dao et al., 2007 ). However, this approach still has drawbacks.
 criterion for matching performance. In EPF, the potential calculated according to an edge map in the test image (i.e., the contours extracted from the test image) and may be signi fi affected by the location of background objects. Fig. 3 shows how background objects in different locations in a test image affect the appearance of the potential fi eld. Fig. 3 (a) and (c) are two edge maps that differ only for vertical and horizontal translations. Their corresponding EPF potential fi elds are shown in Fig. 3 (b) and (d), respectively. In general, the potential values are higher when the contour curves approach each other. Suppose that the triangles in
Fig. 3 (a) and (c) are the targets to be detected. Obviously, the potential values around the two triangles are quite different, which in turn affects the matching results. In order to investigate further, we present another example in Fig. 4 , where the test images are stained or occluded by background objects or noise points. Fig. 4 (a) shows the pre-de fi ned template contour. Fig. 4 (b) shows the capability of EPF to distinguish even slightly different shapes. The case depicted in
Fig. 4 (c) is designed to fi nd out how background objects surrounding the target affect recognition accuracy. Fig. 4 (d) and (e) shows two complicated cases where the test images are severely damaged (scratched by lines or stained by noise points). With regard to the correctly distinguish between even slightly different shapes. However, inthesecondcase(see Fig. 5 (b)), it misidenti fi es the target. In the other two cases (see Fig. 5 (c) and (d)), the recognition results are even worse. Fig. 6 shows the corresponding potential fi elds of all four cases. In this example, an exhaustive search algorithm is used to matching results to guarantee the global optima. It may be noted that when an edge map contains too many background objects, the corresponding potential fi eld may produce a misleading recognition result.

Second, the computational complexity of the EPF algorithm is also an important issue. In EPF, complexity depends on the size of the test image. When the test image is large, the computational load of the EPF approach is heavy, which renders it unsuitable for online monitoring or surveillance applications that require fast processing of frequently collected visual information. 3.2. Concept of APF model
The APF model was originally inspired by EPF. However, in APF, the interactions between two pixel points are de fi ned in a different way. Fig. 7 illustrates how the atomic potential energy changes with the distance between two pixel points. It may be noted that if the distance is smaller than a certain threshold, the potential energy is positive and increases when the distance decreases. On the other hand, if the distance exceeds the thresh-old, the potential energy becomes negative and fi nally converges to zero when the distance approaches in fi nity. At a certain distance, the potential energy is minimal.

An atom potential function behaving similarly to the curve plotted in Fig. 7 is introduced to replace Eq. (2) . In contrast with the situation in the EPF approach, the mutual potential energy value between two pixel points in the generation of an APF potential fi eld does not decrease monotonically to zero when the distance between them increases. The utilization of this potential function results in a potential fi eld different from that calculated by the EPF approach. Fig. 8 shows an instance of the use of the adopted potential function, calculated by Eq. (4) .

As the fi gure shows, the energy values in the APF potential are negative at a number of pixels surrounding the contour.
Furthermore, in Fig. 8 (b), if the two points on the contour are close to each other, the EPF potential values near these points are relatively large. Such a phenomenon is not apparent in Fig. 8 (c).
This is partly due to the fact that under the same situation, the APF function converges to zero more rapidly than the EPF function.
In addition, the APF function does not monotonically decrease in value as the distance term an additional penalty is imposed in the neighboring region of the target counter to improve the recognition of the local features. 3.3. Procedure of APF approach for target recognition mentioned above, a natural solution is to calculate the potential according to a pre-de fi nedtemplatecontourratherthantheedgemap derived from the test image. In this case, the computational burden will depend only on the size of the target contour. Furthermore, since there is no background object in the pre-de fi ned template, the recognition results will not be affected by such noise. When generating apotential fi eld using the APF approach, the potential value at an observation point  X  a ; b  X  is calculated by
APF  X  a ; b  X  X   X  where m and n are two user-speci fi ed positive parameters that deter-mine the size of the acceptance/rejection region (i.e., the region in the
APF potential fi eld with positive/negative potential values). Note that template, we perform transformation and optimization. In con-trast to the EPF approach, the entire APF potential fi eld, calculated based on Eq. (5) , is transformed here. Then, the similarity, Simi , between the contours in the test image and the transformed potential fi eld is described by
Simi  X  1 M  X  K contours in the test image, and APF n  X  a ; b  X  is the potential value of the point  X  a ; b  X  in the transformed potential fi eld. The value of Simi is maximal when optimal transformation is obtained. In summary, the complete procedure of the APF method for shape recognition is described by the fl ow chart in Fig. 9 .

It may be noted that the transformation of the APF potential usually takes a bit longer than the transformation of the template contour, since a potential fi eld is more complex than a template contour. However, fortunately, the potential fi eld is usually sparse becausethevalueofAPF  X  a ; b  X  approaches 0 quickly, as shown in Fig. 7 .
Therefore, the computational comp lexity of such transformations is still acceptable. Considering the ef fi ciency with which the potential fi eld is generated, the overall computational burden of the APF approach is much smaller than that of the EPF approach.
It should also be noted that the procedure described in Fig. 9 is designed for searching a single optimal result. In reality, a test image may contain several objects that match the same template.
This problem can easily be solved by fi nding several equally good solutions instead of a single optimal solution.

As in any optimization algorithm, parameter selection is an open problem. However, a guideline for the selection of m and n is as follows. In APF, m controls the damping rate of the exponential functions in Eq. (5) .Withalarger m ,theAPFpotentialvalueconverges to 0 more rapidly. On the contrary, the APF potential value decays more gradually with a smaller m .Consequently,alarger m makes the
APF algorithm more sensitive to the dissimilarity between the target contour and objects in the test image, but also makes the algorithm less robust. The value of n determines the period of the cosine functions in Eq. (5) , and hence controls local discrimination ability.
Alarger n makes the effect of non-monotonicity in the APF potential map more signi fi cant.However,ifthevalueof n is too large, the period of the cosine functions will be too small, causing the APF potential map to oscillate too much. As a result, the overall recognition performance of APF is also affected . Therefore, there is a tradeoff in the selection of the values of m and n . 4. Principle of IF-ABC algorithm
In searching for the best match based on the APF model, an appropriate geometrical transformation (i.e., translation, reorien-tation, scaling, etc.) of the template contour is carried out to maximize Simi ,de fi ned in Eq. (6) . The search process for such an optimal transformation is NP-hard. Therefore, a modi fi ed version of ABC  X  IF-ABC  X  is adopted to solve this problem ( Li et al., 2014 ).
Like ABC, IF-ABC is a swarm intelligence optimization algo-rithm adapted from the foraging behavior of bees. The bee colony mainly consists of two groups: employed bees and onlookers. Let X by the i th employed bee or onlooker bee  X  i  X  1 ; ... ; SN  X  , where SN is the total number of employed bees or onlookers. In the optimiza-tion problem, one location represents one candidate solution to the optimization problem.

At the beginning, all employed bees are randomly sent out to explore the space of nectar sources (i.e., the feasible solution space). Mathematically, the process to initialize the j th element of the i th solution X i is described in the following equation: X  X  X j min  X  rand  X  0 ; 1  X  X  X j max X j min  X  ;  X  j  X  1 ; where X j min and X j max denote two boundaries of the j th element, and there are at most D elements in X i .

Following this, an employed bee executes a crossover and mutation procedure in each iteration to share information with a randomly selected companion. Such procedure is expressed as follows: X i  X  X
In this equation, the i th employed bee exchanges information about the j th element with the k th employed bee. In addition, rand  X  1 ; 1  X  refers to a random number obeying the uniform distribution from 1 to 1. The greedy selection strategy is then implemented to choose the better source between X n j i and X to select a position with a higher objective function value. In contrast to conventional ABC, the number of elements involved in the crossover and mutation procedure in IF-ABC is considered fl exible. In other words, Eq. (8) should be implemented on each of the employed bees for trial  X  i  X  times, where trial  X  i  X  will discuss later. Thus a global exploration is completed.
Following this, the onlookers carry on with the local searching process. In IF-ABC, each of the employed bees is allowed to be followed by an onlooker, regardless of whether or not they are  X  quali fi ed  X  , to bring about more opportunities (i.e., diversity) for evolution and to fi ght against premature convergence. Therefore, the roulette selection strategy is discarded in IF-ABC as each of the onlookers directly chooses an employed bee for local search using
Eq. (9) . Here, the companion X k and the element item j (involved in the crossover and mutation procedure) are randomly selected.
Then, the greedy selection strategy is applied to the onlookers to choose the better source between X n i and X i .

X i  X  X where  X  i  X  X  exp  X  trial  X  i  X  1 ln 10 D 1 :  X  10  X 
For each of the employed bees and its corresponding onlooker, the parameter trial represents the number of inef fi cient searches before a better position is obtained. If the i th employed bee or the
Otherwise, it is increased by 1. If trial  X  i  X  is larger than D , the i th position X i should be re-initialized using Eq. (7) .

Since 1 r trial  X  i  X  r D ,itisexpectedthatasmanyas trial  X  i  X  out of the D elements in a candidate feasible solution will be affected by the exploration process. However, for onlooker bees, only one element is involved because the multi-crossover process contributes little to local search ability. The convergence factor  X  in Eq. (9) aims to manipulate the exploitation accuracy according to the current convergence state of the i th pair of the employed bee and the onlooker bee. trial  X  i  X  approaches D . Here, 0.1 is a user-speci fi ed lower boundary on the convergence scale. The exploitation procedure around a given employed bee is enhanced with the increase in the number of unfruitful searches (i.e., with the increase in trial  X  i  X  ) until the employed  X  onlooker pair of bees in question is eventually dis-carded and replaced by re-initialization (when trial  X  i  X  exceeds D ). the local exploitation accuracy and guides the crossover and mutation process in global exploration. In conventional ABC, onlookers only exploit  X  quali fi ed  X  employed bees, where the quali fi cation of each employed bee is veri fi ed by the correspond-ing objective function value using the roulette selection strategy.
In our proposed algorithm, convergence performances of the bees are measured not by the corresponding objective function values, but by whether they are in fact better than the previous ones, thus offering more opportunities for the exploitation of  X  unquali employed bees to promote swarm diversity.
 code of the IF-ABC algorithm for constrained optimization pro-blems is given below. A fl ow chart is shown in Fig. 10 . 5. Experimental results and discussions and ef fi ciency of the proposed APF approach and report our results. We also compare the convergence performances of the
IF-ABC and the ABC algorithms. All simulations presented in this section were implemented in MATLAB R2010a and executed on an
Intel Core 2 Duo CPU with 2 GB RAM running at 2.53 GHz. The parameter setting is as follows. In the APF approach, m  X  0 n  X  = 6, whereas  X   X  1 in EPF. For the IF-ABC algorithm, the swarm population SN is set to 40.
 First, the simulation cases described in Fig. 4 are used to test the
APF approach. For a fair comparison , the same optimization algorithm as in Section 3  X  theexhaustivesearchalgorithm  X  is used to best match. The results are plotted in Fig. 11 , where the red lines denote the recognition results. Clearly, in all four cases, objects that have the same shape as the template contour are correctly recognized.
This indicates that the APF approach is robust against irrelevant objects and background noise in the test images. A comparison between Figs. 5 and 11 shows that the use of the atomic potential function in potential fi eld calculation is effective and signi improves the accuracy of recognition.

We use three more realistic examples to test the performances of the APF and the EPF approaches. In these examples, the IF-ABC algorithm is used to optimize the best match transformations, where MCN  X  1000.

The fi rst example involves the detection of B-52 bombers in a satellite image of an aircraft boneyard, i.e., Fig. 12 (a). The image is obtained from Google Earth of Google Inc. s . Fig. 12 (b) plots the template contour of a B-52 bomber. To fi nd multiple matching objects, the search algorithm is implemented multiple times, and the four best results with the highest Simi values are plotted. Fig. 13 (a) shows the results of the APF approach, whereas Fig. 13 (b) is based on EPF results. In both fi gures, there are two recognition results that nearly overlap. Therefore, three bombers are identi fi ed by APF, whereas only EPF correctly locates one bomber. This comparison con fi rms that APF outperforms EPF when there are irrelevant objects and signi fi cant background noise in the test images. Further, we compare the computational burden of the two approaches. In this example, the size of the test image is 437 299 pixels. The EPF approach takes about 328 s to calculate the potential fi eld, whereas the APF approach takes a negligibly small amount of time to initialize.

The second example concerns the detection of an aircraft carrier. The test image ( Fig. 14 (a)) in this case is provided by Google Earth as well. Fig. 14 (b) shows the template contour. In this case, the white caps surging around the aircraft carrier (see Fig.14 (a)) interfere with the extraction of the edge map. To test the reliability of both the APF and the EPF approaches, the optimiza-tion process is carried out repeatedly and the best four results are plotted in Fig. 15 . As is obvious from the fi gure, the APF approach recognizes the aircraft carrier more accurately than the EPF approach. In this case, the size of the test image is 1000 708 pixels. The EPF approach takes about 14,140.18 s to calculate the potential fi eld, while the time taken by the APF algorithm is still negligibly small.

The third instance relates to the recognition of a speci fi traditional Chinese seal pattern ( Fig. 16 (b)) among many similar ones ( Fig. 16 (a)). Again, the target object hides in a complex background, thus making recognition quite dif fi cult. Fig. 17 (a) shows that the APF approach makes a mistake in three repeated recognition procedures.
However, this result is still much better than that of the EPF approach. Fig. 17 (b) shows that the EPF approach cannot identify the correct pattern at all.

Finally, we also evaluate and compare the convergence rates of the IF-ABC algorithm and the conventional ABC algorithm. The comparison experiments are conducted for all three examples described above. In each case, both the ABC and the IF-ABC algorithms are adopted in the APF recognition scheme. Each experiment is repeated 100 times to guarantee statistical signi cance. Figs. 18  X  20 show the convergence curves of both algorithms for all three cases. Given that template matching optimization is a non-convex NP-hard problem, the results con fi rm that the internal feedback strategy applied in IF-ABC provides more ef fi cient searching. 6. Conclusion
This paper presented a new edge-based shape matching optimization model for visual target recognition, which aims to overcome the de fi ciencies of the conventional EPF approach. The advantages of the proposed APF approach are two-fold. First, by using the atom potential function instead of the edge potential function, the APF approach is more robust against irrelevant background objects and noise. Second, the APF approach calculates the potential fi eld based on the template instead of the test image, and conducts best match searching in a different manner from the
EPF approach. As a result, the computational burden is signi -cantly reduced. Both advantages were con fi rmed with case stu-dies. Further, the search process for the best match transformation that uses IF-ABC is more ef fi cient than that using ABC. It is also worth to notice that if the test image is small and does not contain signi fi cant background objects or noise, the proposed APF approach may not outperform the conventional EPF approach.
