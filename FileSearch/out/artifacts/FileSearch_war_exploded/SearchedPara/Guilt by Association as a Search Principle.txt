 The exploitation of fundamental invariants is among the most elegant solutions to many computational problems in a wide variety of domains. One of the more powerful approaches to association is the foundation of remote homolog detection, protein function prediction, disease subtype diagnosis, treatment plan prognosis, and other challenges in computational biology. The principle suggests that two entities are in a specifi c relationship if they e xhibit invariant properties underlying that relationship. For ex ample, a protein is predicted to have a particular biological function if it exhibits the underlying invariant prope rties of that functional group---viz., guilty by association to other members of that functiona l group through the shared invariant properties. In my talk, I plan to present several facets of guilt by association in the computational prediction of protein function and draw parallels of these facets in information retrieval. Specifically, I plan to touch on the following facets: (a) the issue of chance associations; (b) novel generalizable forms of association; (c) fusion of multiple heterogeneous sources of evidence; (d) the dichotomy of knowing to a high degree of reliability that tw o entities are in some relationship and yet not knowing what that relationship is. I hope this ta lk will be, for the informational retrieval community, a window to the opportunities in co mputational biology that may benefit from the depth and variety of solutions info rmation retrieval has to offer. and H.3.3 Information Search and Retrieval.
