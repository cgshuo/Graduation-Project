 We studied the process of sharing and managing knowledge (common ground process) in three -member teams performing emergency management planning tasks on shared maps. We built a reference task and a role -based multi -view protot ype for studying this process. In this paper we empirically test the claim that common ground increases through joint experience on a task over time . We model the common ground process using a realistic task, a controlled setting, and multiple measures. We present findings from the analysis of questionnaires, communication transcripts, videos, and artifacts.
 H.5.3 Group and Organization Interfaces Experimentation, Measurement Common ground, CSCW, geo -collaboration, measure, prototype In order to efficiently work together, the members of a working team need to establish and maintain common ground. Greater amount of common ground  X  mutual knowledge, beliefs, and protocols that partners shar e  X  leads to more efficient communication. Studies of teamwork in critical settings, such as flight crews, show that more efficient communication among team members results in better coordination and performance. A good understanding of each other X  X  roles, tasks, and role -specific information is essential to manage interdependencies, coordinate work, and perform effectively as a team. This is especially relevant for supporting teams of diverse experts collaborating on complex problems in constrained time/sp ace conditions [4, 2]. We study the process of sharing and managing knowledge (common ground process) in three -member teams performing emergency management planning tasks on shared maps. We built a reference task and a prototype for studying this process. The task models the work of small teams of different experts making complex decisions. The team members are required to manage both shared and unshared knowledge in real time to construct an optimal plan. The design of the reference task adapts the hidden profile paradigm from group psychology to measure knowledge sharing/coordination and performance in geo -collaboration. It enables the experimenters to exert control and measurement on relevant task parameters (for example, amount of information and qualit y of decisions, respectively). In everyday conversations people develop and share a ladder of linked assumptions about each other in their current situation (Clark X  X   X  X ction ladder X  ; [3]). This makes their communication more effective. Two ways to share these assumptions are (1) repeating successful interactions in similar situations; and (2) explicitly communicating about what can be assumed. An analogous phenomenon also occurs in the context of co -operation and co -production: groups develop regulatory s tructures that are later assumed and used to make group work more effective. These structures regulate various aspects of cooperative work (communication, performance, social and power relations) and are refined as the members keep working together [6]. We use both techniques to manipulate the amount of shared knowledge and test their effects: (1) the team repeats the same type of task over three runs; (2) half of the teams are given a pre -task briefing about roles, which increments the initial amount of sh ared knowledge of members X  roles for the team X  X  task. In this short paper, we present support for the claim that common ground increases through joint experience on a task over time . We developed an early conceptual model of common ground in group decision making built on a psychological model of group process [6] and the activity system model from activity theory (see [1]). We are now operationalizing parts of this conceptual model in empirical terms. This paper is part of this effort. In par ticular, here propose an operationalization that deconstructs and measures the common ground process in small teams of experts sharing knowledge and constructing emergency management plans on maps. In this context, we analyze the claim that common ground i ncreases through joint experience on a task over time . This claim has been believed or assumed by prior work but it has not been operationalized or assessed empirically. Our aim is to conduct such an assessment in a realistic collaborative setting. In orde r to model the common ground process we developed and piloted a reference task and we used a controlled procedure to study the effects of the manipulations mentioned above (repeated runs and pre -briefing). Relevant task factors were kept constant or contro lled. The effects were measured and conditions compared using multiple measures.
 We have begun this program of study by investigating face -to -face teams with a paper prototype as our baseline condition: how people share and perform on the reference task wi th minimal tool mediation. A second study is being conducted with the same task and a software prototype. The findings presented here are from the paper prototype study. We studied three -member emergency planning teams, where members have different and stable roles, and contribute different areas of expertise all required to perform the task successfully. The three roles were Public Works, Environmental, and Mass Care expert. Each member received shared and unshared information to use in completing a map -based emergency management planning (EMP) task.
 The study is a 3x2 factorial design; t he two factors are Repeated Runs (of the task) and Pre -Briefing. Study participants are organized into twelve teams; six receive and six do not receive pre -briefin g on roles. Each team performs three versions of the EMP task, using equivalent sets of task materials. All participants learn about the role they themselves play, but for half of the teams, the participants are also briefed on the roles that the other two team members play. Across the three runs, the role descriptions remained the same, but the other task materials changed. Both manipulations are introduced to change the amount of shared knowledge in the teams. All teams except one were s ame -gender teams (6 male, 5 female, and 1 mixed -gender) and all were graduate students. The task was designed by adapting an experimental paradigm developed by Stasser and colleagues to study information sharing in group decision -making (see [7] for a rev iew). Four alternative solutions are available for the rescue plan, but one solution is more optimal than the others (which are equally suboptimal). It is important to note that relevant information is distributed across team members. Thus, the performance of the team is dependent on members X  ability to share role -specific information in a timely and equal manner. A superior decision alternative exists but its superiority is hidden from individual members (who are biased toward suboptimal solutions). It can only be discovered if the members pool and synthesize their unshared and shared knowledge about risks effectively [7]. For a more detailed description of the reference task refer to Carroll et al. [2]. During each of the three task instances , the team is asked to build the best plan for rescuing a family from a flooded area to an appropriate shelter. At the start of a task, each member receives a description of the current task scenario, a role -specific map, and a set of 15 pieces of information. The info rmation presents  X  X ons X  related to particular shelters as a solution; for each team member, the information consists of 8 unshared and 7 shared cons. The task was designed to operationalize the process of common ground building in the context of geo -collaboration. During the task, we recorded team members X  initial preferences for a rescue solution as well as the final team decisions. We also tracked how each piece of information (con) was used in performing the task. At the beginning of each task , each member worked individually. They related each con they had been given to their role -specific map and judged its relevance on a 5 -point scale. Note that, given the limited time available we assumed that not all cons would receive the same attention a nd a few cons would be overlooked. These time constraints made the task realistically challenging and were a useful precondition to assess how effectively teams share knowledge while working as a team. The ratings of each member were analyzed to keep track of what cons had been acknowledged individually and judged relevant (Figure 1, bottom plane). In the second part of the run, members shared any information they considered relevant and co -constructed the rescue plan on the shared map. We transcribed the team X  X  verbal interactions, so that we could analyze their collaborative dialogs. Moreover, for each turn of conversation the experimenters recorded if a con was mentioned by noting the unique identifier of that con. The results were used to keep track of what pieces of decision -making information had surfaced to the level of group discussion and how often these cons were mentioned (Figure 1, middle plane). After the completion of each run, the members filled out two post -task surveys. The first was a set of 43 psychometric scales measuring participants X  perceptions of the task X  X  process quality (e.g., awareness and common ground) and the outcomes of collaboration. The second was a set of open -ended questions assessing the degree to which each team member r ecalled (a) the shelter chosen; and (b) role -specific information discussed in relation to each of the three best solutions considered by the team. The answers were analyzed and compared across the three members. Thus the two questionnaires measured both s ubjective perceptions and more objective recall measures of common ground or related constructs (e.g. awareness) (Figure 1 top plane). All of the measures were compared across repeated runs and pre -briefing conditions. We present data from the questionnair es of all twelve teams and data from coded transcriptions of eight of the teams (four without and four with pre -briefing on roles). We manipulated the amount of shared experience on the planning task (repeated runs) and the amount of shared knowledge about roles (pre -briefing). We assessed effects of these manipulations both on measures of process and outcomes. The post -task questionnaire provides subjective measures of quality of process and outcome. The post -task recall survey provi des an objective measure of common ground -amount of knowledge grounded. The reference task allows measuring the optimality of the final team decisions and coverage of information. The post -session questionnaire included psychometric sc ales to measure aspects common ground, awareness and outcome quality (see cscl.ist.psu.edu/public/projects/ONRproject/quest.html ): gain of shared knowledge ( GSK , 3 items) , quality of communication co mmunication means ( CM , 4 items) , ease of referencing and planning ( E_R&amp;P , 7 items) , interpersonal awareness (4 items) , awareness over time (3 items) , performance ( PER , 4 items), and satisfaction ( SAT , 4 items) . The items were grouped in clusters, one for e ach of the measures mentioned above. The reliability analysis shows that the items in each cluster were highly inter -correlated and that this was consistent across the three runs (with 12x3=36 individual data points per run): the Cronbach alpha values rang ed from .73 -.94 in Run 1, .60 -.93 in Run 2,.77 -.91 in Run 3. We computed aggregated scores for each factor (Table 1). Table 1 : Process &amp; outcome measures c lusters by run (1, 2 and 3) Process Out SAT We assessed the impact of Run and Briefing on the subjective process measures. Members X  perceptions of common ground inc rease significantly over the three runs (Table 1). Evident is the rise in  X  X ain of Shared Knowledge, X  a score that aggregates three rating scales. It increases from an average rating of 5.69 (st.d.= 0.13) in the first run to 6.15 (st.d.= 0.11) in the third . Overall, the a nalysis of questionnaire data shows that the perceived amount of common ground increases through task repetition. The measures of perceived outcome quality also increased.
 To assess the significance of these trends, we conducted a Repeated Measures MANOVA with Run as a within -subjects factor, Briefing as between -subjects, and the nine variables as the repeated measures. This test revealed that Briefing had no effect, but that there was a significant effect of Run (F p&lt;.001) . Repeated Measures Univariate ANOVAs with each of the process and outcome measures show that Run has a strong effect on gain of shared knowledge, communication means, ease of referencing and planning, performance, satisfaction, and a moderate effect on qu ality of communication and understanding &amp; expression (see p -values of U nivariate ANOVAs in Table 1). To explore in more depth how information was shared and used by team members (e.g., as suggested in Figure 1), we recorde d the occurrences of each piece of relevant information and computed ratios across stages as a measure of retention. From task materials to member acknowledgment. On average, 10.4 of the 15 cons (70%) were rated by each team member at the start of each task, providing us a measure of how much of the task information provided was actually processed individually. From member acknowledgment to team discussion. On average, the ratio of information items shared in task discussions to the items acknowledged by individual members was .78 on Run 1 and .76 on Run 3, with a range of .6 to 1.0 for both Runs. For three teams this ratio increased, two stayed the same, and three decreased from first to third runs. This suggests that most of the provided information was shared during discussion and there was no significant difference in amount of sharing across runs. From team discussion to individual recall. On average, the ratio of information recalled after the task versus that shared during discussion was .51 for Run 1 and .67 for Run 3, with a range of .3 to 1.0 and .2 to 1.0. Four groups showed an increase in ratios between the first and third run, three stayed the same, and one group X  X  recall ratio decreased (Figure 2). This difference provides us with an i ndication of the development of common ground between team members. The recall survey also measured the members X  recall of shelters chosen. Almost everyone recalled the best shelter chosen, but the recall for the second and third best shelters (alternative plans) appeared to increase over time. We run the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, a non -parametric test, to compare on responses from run 1 vs. run 3. The recall for the second shelter was significantly higher on run 3 than on run 1 (p &lt; .01 ). We examined the discussion transcripts to search for an explanation of Group 1 X  X  drop. We found that in the first task, the members considered the heavy rain and porous road soil together. After repeated refere nces to both cons together they  X  X horthanded X  these two cons to  X  X uddy road X . Thus, the development of common ground actually led to a summative description of multiple pieces of information. This has led us examine the content and context of information shared in order to more completely explain the creation of common ground.
 We also explored members' recall for information about their partners X  concerns on the first and the last run. We scored the recall as follows: 0 if a member did not recall any conce rn from either partner, 1 if they recalled concerns from one, 2 if they recalled concerns from both. In the first run, 10 people scored 0, 10 scored 1, and 4 scored 2; the corresponding tallies for the third run were 6, 9, and 9. Figure 3: Recall Informa tion Ratios between 1st and 3rd Run When we consider team averages across the first and the last runs, we see that five teams recalled more, one stayed the same, and two recalled less (Figure 3). Furthermore, we noted that across all the groups, the knowle dge recalled tended to be more general than about the specific concerns that had been discussed during the task. The recall focused more often on clusters of concerns. This may be because the recall occurred after the team had synthesized the information i n order to make a decision, or it may reflect more general -purpose recall and retrieval strategies. With this paper we present support for the claim that common ground increases through the joint experience of a task over time by developing a me thod for modeling and measuring the common ground process in a specific task domain. We show that common ground does increase through multiple runs of a geo -collaborative task. This was demonstrated by the improvement in recalled alternative solutions, inc rease of recalled role -specific information, and subjective self -assessment of process measures. We present multiple methods for gathering and analyzing the building of common ground including standardized questionnaires, open -ended questionnaires, and tra nscript coding and analysis. The design of the reference task allows measuring the transfer of knowledge at different critical junctions of the group process, as represented in our model.
 The findings and methods reported here are an important step toward investigating empirically how common ground increases through shared experience, as well as how partners choose to share and continue to consider pieces of information as part of their common ground. Although we have just begun to explore the implications and dynamics of the conceptual model sketched in Figure 1, our ongoing analyses of the collaboration transcripts will help us to articulate further the group dynamics and other factors that influence information sharing and synthesis. At the same time, we will be able to use data collected in our paper -prototype study as a baseline for comparison for analogous studies that use the same reference task and methods but in the context of map -based software tools. Using the geo -collaborative tool we have recent ly developed [7], we will study emergency planning as a remote collaborative task  X  this magnifies both the challenge and the importance of facilitating the growth of common ground.
