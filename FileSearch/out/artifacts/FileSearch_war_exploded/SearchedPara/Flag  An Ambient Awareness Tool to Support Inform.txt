 We present Flag , an awareness tool that gives information on the presence and status of students in a university leaning center with the aim of promoting inform al collaboration among them. Considering learning centers as ecosystems in which the learners can benefit from sharing knowledge with one another, we believe ecosystem would encourage and facilitate interactions.

 Human factors Ambient awareness, Compute r-supported collaborative learning Facilities that promote active learning, interaction and social engagement are increasingly significant in learning space design. This can be achieved by coordinating architecture and technology in designing environments that support informal collaborative learning [1]. We contribute on the technology side and propose embedding awareness information in the learning spaces. We believe that informing students about the presence and status of the others would encourage a higher level and more complex structure of collaboration. In our previous work, we developed an awareness tool, called Lantern, which displays teams X  st atus in recitation section (i.e. when students work individually or in small teams on their exercise sets with the help of teaching assistants). An empirical study showed that, Lantern incr eases collaboration within and between teams [2]. Scaling up the idea of Lantern (giving ambient awareness information in order to promote collaboration), we designed Flag that targets multipurpose learning centers, where students from all over the university can use library books and study individually or in groups. service that searches in the data collected from the boxes and represents the result either em bedded in the environment or displayed on screen and overlaid on the map of the learning center. We also briefly present the idea of Virtual Flag as a software emulator of the system. Flag is currently under development. A learning center is a place where students, researchers and educators from all over the university are engaged in learning activities individually or in a group. Library books and work tables along with an appropriate lighting make it a comfortable place for studying. Some parts of learning centers are dedicated to individual and calm studying, while in some others teamwork, discussion or meeting may take place. The majority of the learning centers X  users are students who study course materials. The seminal goal is to encourage and support collaboration in learning centers, by providing awareness information, specifically on the presence, availability and status of the learners. For instance, we believe that, a student who knows that a group of her classmates are working on the course that she is preparing for its exam, might join the group. In general, being informed about the activities in a learning center allows making use of it as not only a quiet and comfortable space but also a learning ecosystem where students can benefit from each other through informal intentional interactions. On the other hand, the mean to provide the awareness information should avoid violating the privacy of students and not taking their attention away from the main task. To pursue our objective, we de signed Flag, which encompasses center and an online query service that can search in that data. units to be used by four students working around the table. A courses, the one that she is going to study now. A column of Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs), cove red by blurry Plexiglas, department and year. The last LED faces upwards and projects some of this information onto th e ceiling using a Fresnel lens. The information to be displayed is filtered according to the student privacy setting which can be configured using an online portal. Figure 1 shows the interactive box and Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of displayed information in a learning center when Flag is used. The status of the student, location of the table as well as the data collected from the other sensors (noise, temperature, etc.) are sent to a server using a Wi-Fi module. A student can browse the learning center map (Figure 3) and query, for example:  X  Where, in the learning center, are my classmates?  X  Where, in the learning center, is Physics II being studied?  X  How crowded and noisy is each part of the learning center?  X  Is the teaching assistant of Physics II available in the learning  X  Any combination of the above queries. Using the same map, she can select a seat and book it for a limited while. A message would appear on the table announcing that the seat is reserved. For users who do not work on Flag -equipped tables, an emulation using a triangulation algorithm and make her information accessible through the query service. We proposed a tool that collects data on the ongoing learning represented in an ambient way in the learning center, which we hope would encourage interac tion amongst the learners. The collected data is also accessible through an online query service find their points of interest and choose a place that matches their the classmates who work on the same course). [1] Oblinger, D.
