 Semantic parsing is the task of mapping natural language sentences into complete formal mean-ing representations which a computer can exe-cute for some domain-specific application. This is a challenging task and is critical for develop-ing computing systems that can understand and process natural language input, for example, a computing system that answers natural language queries about a database, or a robot that takes commands in natural language. While the im-portance of semantic parsing was realized a long time ago, it is only in the past few years that the state-of-the-art in semantic parsing has been sig-nificantly advanced with more accurate and ro-bust semantic parser learners that use a variety of statistical learning methods. Semantic parsers have also been extended to work beyond a single sentence, for example, to use discourse contexts and to learn domain-specific language from per-ceptual contexts. Some of the future research di-rections of semantic parsing with potentially large impacts include mapping entire natural language documents into machine processable form to en-able automated reasoning about them and to con-vert natural language web pages into machine pro-cessable representations for the Semantic Web to support automated high-end web applications.
This tutorial will introduce the semantic pars-ing task and will bring the audience up-to-date with the current research and state-of-the-art in se-mantic parsing. It will also provide insights about semantic parsing and how it relates to and dif-fers from other natural language processing tasks. It will point out research challenges and some promising future directions for semantic parsing. The proposed tutorial on semantic parsing will start with an introduction to the task, giving ex-
