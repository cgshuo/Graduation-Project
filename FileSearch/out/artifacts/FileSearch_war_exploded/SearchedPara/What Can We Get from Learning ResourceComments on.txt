We have already done some data mining research based on our new EP in the last two years, such as [1,2], in this work we want to try another method to mine more useful information from our EP. For we can get search results by inputting query keywords in our EP homepage, as shown in Figure 2, we input  X  X ata min-ing X  as search keyword, and we can get 26 learning resource objects. From the results page, we can get a summary of each item, such as: title, resource, disci-pline, and the source where they come from. If we click the link under the first learning resource title, we get more details about it and add comment about it.
The  X 100 Most Commented X  is what we used in this paper. The contents of comment should contain rating, comment title, comment description, author and post time. How to use these dataset to answer the questions like  X  X hich learning resource object should we choose X  or  X  X hich one is the best search result and which one is exactly what I want X  ? That is the reason why we focus on using these comments to evaluate the learning resources, and we can achieve this by
Learning recourses evaluation by their comments is such a multiple, diverse criteria decision-making problem with high complexity, so we draw lessons from Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a classi cal method presented by Saaty[3] and be cited more than 1,000 times. We make some modifications on this method and will give more details on the following sections. AHP can be used in many applications besides our web data mining area, such as in ecosystem [4], emergency management [5], plant control [6] and so on so forth. From those research works, it is clear that AHP has been widely applied in many of the data management and decision making areas. To address the problem for EP, we summarize some related former research works as follows:
Some researchers choose a combination of fuzzy theory and AHP, such as Tao et al. [8] , Uzoka et al. [9] and Feng et al. [10]. Tao proposed a decision model by the application of AFS (axiomatic fuzzy set) theory and AHP method to get the ranking order. They also provided the definitely semantic interpretations for the decision results by their theory. Uzoka used fuzzy logic and AHP for medical mation proposed by Tao, thus we try to add them in our EP comments mining this time. However it causes high computational complexity, we will try this in our future work in this aspect.

AHP also could be used with traditional data mining algorithm, such as Svo-ray et al [11]. They used a data mining (DM) procedure based on decision trees to identify areas of gully initiation risk, and compared it with AHP expert system. Rad et al. [13] proposed an very inspiring idea by considering the problem of clustering and ranking university majors in Iran. By eight different criteria and 177 existing university majors, they give the rank of all the university majors. In our paper, we use five different criteria and 100 learning resources as ex-perimental dataset, however, both subjective expert and objective quantitative information are used to bu ild the judgement matrices.

As for educational digital library applications, we focus on how to provide both teachers and students enriching and motivational educational resources as the former researchers do in [14] and [15] . Jing and Qingjun [16] provided teachers and students a virtual knowledge environment where students and teachers enjoy a high rate of participation. Alias et al. [17] described an implementation of digital libraries that integrated semantic research. Mobile ad hoc networks are becoming an important part of the digital library ecology . Social navigation can library portals and to guide portal users to valuable resources in [13]. 3.1 Learning Recourses Comments Hierarchy alternatives layer. The framework of the comments hierarchy and the content of eachlayerisasshowninFigure7.  X  Objective layer: Select the most valua ble learning resource by comments;  X  Criteria layer: rating, comment title, comment descriptio n/comment content,  X  Alternatives layer: the top 100 mo st commented resources in one certain 3.2 Judgement Matrices There are one judgement matrix in crite ria layer and five judgement matrices in alternatives layer to be determined. We will establish them based on the expert information and quantitative information respectively.
 Judgement Matrices in Criteria Layer. Let matrix M  X  R 5  X  5 denote the the quantitative relative importance judgement of pairwise factors C i and C j , that is, M j,i =1 /M i,j . The standard relative importance scale is employed, as shown in Table.1.
 Judgement Matrices in Alternative Layer. Let matrices M i  X  R 100  X  100 , i =1 ,..., 5, denote the judgement matrix for criteria C i in the alternative layer and A i , i =1 ,..., 100, denote the top 100 most commented resources respectively. To establish each matrix M i , we use the following two steps:  X  Calculate the Absolute Importance ( AI i )  X  Scale and calculate the Relative Importance ( RI i ) Specifically, we present the following methods to determine the judgement ma-trices in the alternative layer 1. Rating matrix M 1 2. Comment title matrix M 2 3. Comment description matrix M 3 4. Author type matrix M 4 5. Posting time matrix M 5 3.3 Weighting After getting the judgement matrix M , we obtain the weightings of the five responding to the maximum eigenvalue  X  max ,thatis, as the normalized eigenvectors w i max of M i as follows: Note that for M i , i =1 ,..., 5, they are 100  X  100 dimension matrices, thus it is time-consuming job to exactly calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. To obtain a high quality estimation in short time, we use the following approach : 1. Normalize each column in M ,thatis, M i,j = M i,j n 2. Sum M i,j in each row, that is, M i = n j =1 M i,j ; 4. The maximum eigenvalue  X  can be estimated by 1 n n i =1 ( Mw ) i w 3.4 Consistency B and B is better than C ,thenwehave A is also better than C ) and numerically consistent (that is, if A =2 B and B =2 C ,thenwehave A =4 C ). To verify the the following Consistency Ratio (CR): where CI M is so-called Consistence Index of matrix M , defined as, CI M = n  X  1 and RI n is the so-called Random Index for n
Saaty Rule says that if CR M &lt; 0 . 1 ,thenmatrix M is consistent; oth-erwise, we need to adjust M until the condition satisfies .

However, for matrices M i ,i =1 ,..., 5, we assert that they are always consis-tent because thus  X  i max = n and CI M i = 0. Furthermore, the total consistency is also holds because 3.5 Implementation of AHP In this subsection, we summarize the implementation of AHP for our problem. 1. Criteria Evaluation 2. Alternative Weightings Calculation: 3. Alternative Evaluation: In this section, we will evaluate the proposed AHP method on the K-Gray Engineering-Pathway library data. The proposed method will be experimentally compared with other general methods, such average rating, average comment number, to validate its effectiveness. 4.1 Experimental Set Up The top 100 commented learning resour ces on computer science from EP home-page are selected as the the test data. We collect the comment information, that is, comment title, comment description, rating, author and posting time for each learning resource.

To implement the proposed AHP method, first the following judgement ma-trix M in criteria layer is obtained based on the expert information from the questionnaire.
 CR = CI RI =0 . 0192 &lt; 0 . 1, thus it is consistent. The corresponding normal-weightings of the five criteria.

To properly set parameters  X  i , i =1 ,..., 5, we calculate the average number of comments, rating, comment title length, comment length, author value and as a scale factor for the number of comments, so we set  X  i accordingtothe above average value, as shown in Table. 2. Then we can obtain the eigenvectors of M i ,i =1 ,..., 5, by the estimation method in subsection 3.3, and further get the final evaluation of the top 100 commented resources. 4.2 Comparison and Discussion The proposed AHP method is compared wi th the general average methods, such as average rating, average number of comments methods.

We normalized the evaluation of the 100 resources by average rating (AR), average comments length (ACL), average comment title length(ACTL), average number of comments (ANC), average author value (AAV) and average posting time value (APTV). Figure 4 -Figure 9 show the first 50 resource evaluation value by AHP and the above average methods. From Figure 4-Figure 9, we can see that the evaluation results obtained by AHP and ACL own the highest similarity. Furthermore, AHP can be v iewed as a mixed method of these average method.

To make it clear, we define the standard deviation between AHP and method  X  as where v AHP j , v  X  j are the normalized evaluation value for resource j obtained by AHP and method  X  . Table. 3 reports the standard deviation for different methods. ACL and AR have the smaller SD values compared with other methods. It is consistent with the expert information and our proposed AHP method from the judgement matrix M , we see that criteria rati ng and comment length have the bigger weightings. Finally, we rep ort the top 10 recommened resources by AHP, ACL and AR based on the 100 most commented resources on computing sciences.
 The AHP opens up a wide variety of novel applications. So after introducing the problem of automatic learning resources evaluation, we make an attempt to and the vector matrix for selecting items is huge. So we made some improvement on AHP to solve our problem. By establishing three layers model with objec-tive layer, criteria layer and alternative layer, we can provide our users a more comprehensive ranking of our learning r esources. By using subjective expert and objective quantitative information, we can build the judgement matrices, then we calculate the absolute importance, relative importance and finally the judge-ment matrices with the quantified attributes of comments, such as the number of comments, rating, the length of content, the author type and the posting time.
