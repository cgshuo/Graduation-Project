 Corpus-based approaches to machine translation have become predominant, with phrase-based sta-tistical machine translation (PB-SMT) (Koehn et al., 2003) being the most actively progressing area. The success of statistical approaches to MT can be attributed to the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) that characterize word-level alignments in parallel corpora. Parameters of these alignment models are learnt in an unsupervised manner us-ing the EM algorithm over sentence-level aligned parallel corpora. While the ease of automati-cally aligning sentences at the word-level with tools like GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) has en-abled fast development of SMT systems for vari-ous language pairs, the quality of alignment is typ-ically quite low for language pairs like Chinese-English, Arabic-English that diverge from the in-dependence assumptions made by the generative models. Increased parallel data enables better es-timation of the model parameters, but a large num-ber of language pairs still lack such resources.
Two directions of research have been pursued for improving generative word alignment. The first is to relax or update the independence as-sumptions based on more information, usually syntactic, from the language pairs (Cherry and Lin, 2006; Fraser and Marcu, 2007a). The sec-ond is to use extra annotation, typically word-level human alignment for some sentence pairs, in con-junction with the parallel data to learn alignment in a semi-supervised manner. Our research is in the direction of the latter, and aims to reduce the effort involved in hand-generation of word align-ments by using active learning strategies for care-ful selection of word pairs to seek alignment.
Active learning for MT has not yet been ex-plored to its full potential. Much of the litera-ture has explored one task  X  selecting sentences to translate and add to the training corpus (Haf-fari and Sarkar, 2009). In this paper we explore active learning for word alignment, where the in-put to the active learner is a sentence pair ( S,T ) and the annotation elicited from human is a set of links { a ij ,  X  s i  X  S,t j  X  T } . Unlike previous ap-proaches, our work does not require elicitation of full alignment for the sentence pair, which could be effort-intensive. We propose active learning query strategies to selectively elicit partial align-ment information. Experiments in Section 5 show that our selection strategies reduce alignment error rates significantly over baseline. Researchers have begun to explore models that use both labeled and unlabeled data to build word-alignment models for MT. Fraser and Marcu (2006) pose the problem of alignment as a search problem in log-linear space with features com-ing from the IBM alignment models. The log-linear model is trained on available labeled data to improve performance. They propose a semi-supervised training algorithm which alternates be-tween discriminative error training on the la-beled data to learn the weighting parameters and maximum-likelihood EM training on unlabeled data to estimate the parameters. Callison-Burch et al. (2004) also improve alignment by interpolat-ing human alignments with automatic alignments. They observe that while working with such data sets, alignments of higher quality should be given a much higher weight than the lower-quality align-ments. Wu et al. (2006) learn separate models from labeled and unlabeled data using the standard EM algorithm. The two models are then interpo-lated to use as a learner in the semi-supervised algorithm to improve word alignment. To our knowledge, there is no prior work that has looked at reducing human effort by selective elicitation of partial word alignment using active learning tech-niques. Active learning attempts to optimize performance by selecting the most informative instances to la-bel where  X  X nformativeness X  is defined as maximal expected improvement in accuracy. The objective is to select optimal instance for an external expert to label and then run the learning method on the newly-labeled and previously-labeled instances to minimize prediction or translation error, repeat-ing until either the maximal number of external queries is reached or a desired accuracy level is achieved. Several studies (Tong and Koller, 2002; Nguyen and Smeulders, 2004; Donmez and Car-bonell, 2008) show that active learning greatly helps to reduce the labeling effort in various clas-sification tasks. 3.1 Active Learning Setup We discuss our active learning setup for word alignment in Algorithm 1. We start with an un-labeled dataset U = { ( S k ,T k ) } , indexed by k , and a seed pool of partial alignment links A 0 = { a ij ,  X  s i  X  S k ,t j  X  T k } . This is usually an empty set at iteration t = 0 . We iterate for T itera-tions. We take a pool-based active learning strat-egy, where we have access to all the automatically aligned links and we can score the links based on our active learning query strategy. The query strategy uses the automatically trained alignment model M t from current iteration t for scoring the links. Re-training and re-tuning an SMT system for each link at a time is computationally infeasi-ble. We therefore perform batch learning by se-lecting a set of N links scored high by our query strategy. We seek manual corrections for the se-lected links and add the alignment data to the current labeled data set. The word-level aligned labeled data is provided to our semi-supervised word alignment algorithm for training an align-ment model M t +1 over U .

We can iteratively perform the algorithm for a defined number of iterations T or until a certain desired performance is reached, which is mea-sured by alignment error rate (AER) (Fraser and Marcu, 2007b) in the case of word alignment. In a more typical scenario, since reducing human ef-fort or cost of elicitation is the objective, we iterate until the available budget is exhausted. 3.2 Semi-Supervised Word Alignment We use an extended version of MGIZA++ (Gao and Vogel, 2008) to perform the constrained semi-supervised word alignment. Manual alignments are incorporated in the EM training phase of these models as constraints that restrict the summation over all possible alignment paths. Typically in the EM procedure for IBM models, the training pro-cedure requires for each source sentence position, the summation over all positions in the target sen-tence. The manual alignments allow for one-to-many alignments and many-to-many alignments in both directions. For each position i in the source sentence, there can be more than one manually aligned target word. The restricted training will allow only those paths, which are consistent with the manual alignments. Therefore, the restriction of the alignment paths reduces to restricting the summation in EM. We propose multiple query selection strategies for our active learning setup. The scoring criteria is designed to select alignment links across sentence pairs that are highly uncertain under current au-tomatic translation models. These links are diffi-cult to align correctly by automatic alignment and will cause incorrect phrase pairs to be extracted in the translation model, in turn hurting the transla-tion quality of the SMT system. Manual correc-tion of such links produces the maximal benefit to the model. We would ideally like to elicit the least number of manual corrections possible in order to reduce the cost of data acquisition. In this section we discuss our link selection strategies based on the standard active learning paradigm of  X  X ncer-tainty sampling X (Lewis and Catlett, 1994). We use the automatically trained translation model  X  t for scoring each link for uncertainty, which consists of bidirectional translation lexicon tables computed from the bidirectional alignments. 4.1 Uncertainty Sampling: Bidirectional The automatic Viterbi alignment produced by the alignment models is used to obtain transla-tion lexicons. These lexicons capture the condi-tional distributions of source-given-target P ( s/t ) and target-given-source P ( t/s ) probabilities at the word level where s i  X  S and t j  X  T . We de-fine certainty of a link as the harmonic mean of the bidirectional probabilities. The selection strategy selects the least scoring links according to the for-mula below which corresponds to links with max-imum uncertainty: Score ( a ij /s I 1 ,t 1 J ) = 4.2 Confidence Sampling: Posterior Confidence estimation for MT output is an in-teresting area with meaningful initial exploration (Blatz et al., 2004; Ueffing and Ney, 2007). Given a sentence pair ( s I 1 ,t J 1 ) and its word alignment, we compute two confidence metrics at alignment link level  X  based on the posterior link probability as seen in Equation 5. We select the alignment links that the initial word aligner is least confi-dent according to our metric and seek manual cor-rection of the links. We use t 2 s to denote com-putation using higher order (IBM4) target-given-source models and s 2 t to denote source-given-target models. Targeting some of the uncertain parts of word alignment has already been shown to improve translation quality in SMT (Huang, 2009). We use confidence metrics as an active learning sampling strategy to obtain most informa-tive links. We also experimented with other con-fidence metrics as discussed in (Ueffing and Ney, 2007), especially the IBM 1 model score metric, but it did not show significant improvement in this task.
 4.3 Query by Committee The generative alignments produced differ based on the choice of direction of the language pair. We use A s 2 t to denote alignment in the source to target direction and A t 2 s to denote the target to source direction. We consider these alignments to be two experts that have two different views of the align-ment process. We formulate our query strategy to select links where the agreement differs across these two alignments. In general query by com-mittee is a standard sampling strategy in active learning(Freund et al., 1997), where the commit-tee consists of any number of experts, in this case alignments, with varying opinions. We formulate a query by committee sampling strategy for word alignment as shown in Equation 6. In order to break ties, we extend this approach to select the link with higher average frequency of occurrence of words involved in the link.

Score ( a ij ) =  X  (6) 4.4 Margin Sampling The strategy for confidence based sampling only considers information about the best scoring link conf ( a ij /S,T ) . However we could benefit from information about the second best scoring link as well. In typical multi-class classification prob-lems, earlier work shows success using such a  X  X argin based X  approach (Scheffer et al., 2001), where the difference between the probabilities as-signed by the underlying model to the first best and second best labels is used as a sampling cri-teria. We adapt such a margin-based approach to link-selection using the Conf 1 scoring function discussed in the earlier sub-section. Our margin technique is formulated below, where  X  a 1 ij and  X  a 2 ij are potential first best and second best scor-ing alignment links for a word at position i in the source sentence S with translation T . The word with minimum margin value is chosen for human alignment. Intuitively such a word is a possible candidate for mis-alignment due to the inherent confusion in its target translation.

Conf 1(  X  a 1 ij /S,T )  X  Conf 1(  X  a 2 ij /S,T ) 5.1 Data Setup Our aim in this paper is to show that active learn-ing can help select the most informative alignment links that have high uncertainty according to a given automatically trained model. We also show that fixing such alignments leads to the maximum reduction of error in word alignment, as measured by AER. We compare this with a baseline where links are selected at random for manual correction. To run our experiments iteratively, we automate the setup by using a parallel corpus for which the gold-standard human alignment is already avail-able. We select the Chinese-English language pair, where we have access to 21,863 sentence pairs along with complete manual alignment. 5.2 Results We first automatically align the Cn-En corpus us-ing GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003). We then use the learned model in running our link selec-tion algorithm over the entire corpus to determine the most uncertain links according to each active learning strategy. The links are then looked up in the gold-standard human alignment database and corrected. In case a link is not present in the gold-standard data, we introduce a NULL align-ment, else we propose the alignment as given in Figure 1: Performance of active sampling strate-gies for link selection the gold standard. We select the partial align-ment as a set of alignment links and provide it to our semi-supervised word aligner. We plot per-formance curves as number of links used in each iteration vs. the overall reduction of AER on the corpus.

Query by committee performs worse than ran-dom indicating that two alignments differing in direction are not sufficient in deciding for uncer-tainty. We will be exploring alternative formula-tions to this strategy. We observe that confidence based metrics perform significantly better than the baseline. From the scatter plots in Figure 1 1 we can say that using our best selection strategy one achieves similar performance to the baseline, but at a much lower cost of elicitation assuming cost per link is uniform.

We also perform end-to-end machine transla-tion experiments to show that our improvement of alignment quality leads to an improvement of translation scores. For this experiment, we train a standard phrase-based SMT system (Koehn et al., 2007) over the entire parallel corpus. We tune on the MT-Eval 2004 dataset and test on a subset of MT-Eval 2004 dataset consisting of 631 sen-tences. We first obtain the baseline score where no manual alignment was used. We also train a configuration using gold standard manual align-ment data for the parallel corpus. This is the max-imum translation accuracy that we can achieve by any link selection algorithm. We now take the best link selection criteria, which is the confidence Active Selection 20% 19.34 43.25 based method and train a system by only selecting 20% of all the links. We observe that at this point we have reduced the AER from 37.09 AER to 26.57 AER. The translation accuracy as measured by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007) also shows improve-ment over baseline and approaches gold standard quality. Therefore we achieve 45% of the possible improvement by only using 20% elicitation effort. 5.3 Batch Selection Re-training the word alignment models after elic-iting every individual alignment link is infeasible. In our data set of 21,863 sentences with 588,075 links, it would be computationally intensive to re-train after eliciting even 100 links in a batch. We therefore sample links as a discrete batch, and train alignment models to report performance at fixed points. Such a batch selection is only going to be sub-optimal as the underlying model changes with every alignment link and therefore becomes  X  X tale X  for future selections. We observe that in some sce-narios while fixing one alignment link could po-tentially fix all the mis-alignments in a sentence pair, our batch selection mechanism still samples from the rest of the links in the sentence pair. We experimented with an exponential decay function over the number of links previously selected, in order to discourage repeated sampling from the same sentence pair. We performed an experiment by selecting one of our best performing selection strategies ( conf ) and ran it in both configurations -one with the decay parameter ( batchdecay ) and one without it ( batch ). As seen in Figure 2, the decay function has an effect in the initial part of the curve where sampling is sparse but the effect gradually fades away as we observe more samples. In the reported results we do not use batch decay, but an optimal estimation of  X  X taleness X  could lead to better gains in batch link selection using active learning.
 Figure 2: Batch decay effects on Conf-posterior sampling strategy Word-Alignment is a particularly challenging problem and has been addressed in a completely unsupervised manner thus far (Brown et al., 1993). While generative alignment models have been suc-cessful, lack of sufficient data, model assump-tions and local optimum during training are well known problems. Semi-supervised techniques use partial manual alignment data to address some of these issues. We have shown that active learning strategies can reduce the effort involved in elicit-ing human alignment data. The reduction in ef-fort is due to careful selection of maximally un-certain links that provide the most benefit to the alignment model when used in a semi-supervised training fashion. Experiments on Chinese-English have shown considerable improvements. In future we wish to work with word alignments for other language pairs like Arabic and English. We have tested out the feasibility of obtaining human word alignment data using Amazon Mechanical Turk and plan to obtain more data reduce the cost of annotation.
