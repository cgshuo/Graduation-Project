 method works well only when the numbers of clusters is not large and that at l east one random density and distance to find centers for numeric data .
 maintain a balance between the density and distance.
 to avoid the cluster centers we selected be outlier.
 A categorical information system is described as quadruples IS = (U, A, V, f ), where U is the non-empty set of objects, which is called a universe; A is the non-empty set of attributes and finite set of attributes;
V is the union of attribute domains, i.e., V =  X  X  X   X   X   X  ,where  X  and it is finite and unordered, e.g. for any p, q  X   X   X  , either p=q or p  X  X  . f:U X  X  X  X  is an information function such that for any a  X  X  and x X  U,  X f X  X ,a X  X  X 
Let U={  X  1 ,  X  2 ,  X ,...  X  } be a set of n objects, A={  X  domain of attribute  X   X  for 1  X  X  X  X . Adomain  X   X  unordered, i.e.,  X   X  m .

Where n is the number of objects in U; k(  X  X  X  X s a known number of clusters;  X  X  1, X  X  X  is the fuzzy index; W=[  X   X  X  ]isak  X  X  real matrix,  X   X  X  is the membership degree of  X   X  1 ,  X  2 ,...,  X   X   X  X  X , R X  1 X   X  X  2 X   X  X ... X   X  X  ,  X   X  =[  X  1 X  object  X   X  and prototype  X   X  of the lth cluster which is defined as following two minimization problems: Problem P1. Fix Z=  X   X  , solve the reduced problem F(W,  X  Problem P2. Fix W=  X   X  ,solve the reduced problem F(  X   X  ,Z ) with the constraints in (2). This process is formalized in the fuzzy k-modes algorithms as follows [22] : Step 1. Choose an initial point set  X   X 1 X   X  X  .Determine  X  t=1.
 Step 2. Determine  X   X 1 X  X  X  X  such that F X   X   X  ,  X   X 1 X  X  X  X  ) is minimized. If F X   X  stop; otherwise goto Step3.
 Step 3. Determine  X   X 1 X  X  X  X  such that  X F X   X 1 X   X ,  X 1 X  X  X  X   X  is minimized. If  X F then stop; otherwise set t=t+1 and goto Step 2.
 solve these problem, a new initialization method for categorical data is p roposed in Section 3. use the outlier detection to avoid select the outlier.
