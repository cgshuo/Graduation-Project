 1. Introduction (FSs) and neural networks (NNs) can be considered as a universal approximator, and hence can approximate any continuous functions on a compact set to a given accuracy ( Cabrera and Narendra, 1999; Wang, 1992; Buckley, 1993; Castro, 1995;
Yager and Kreinovich, 2003 ). A fuzzy model (particularly the rule-based one) has a number of advantages in comparison with global nonlinear models, such as neural networks. The model structure is easy to understand and sometimes interpretable.
Various types of knowledge can be integrated in the model, including statistical objects and empirical knowledge ( Wolkenhauer, 2001 ).
 of representing and modelling imprecision and uncertainty by giving each point in fuzzy set a value belonging to the interval [0,1]. However, the imprecision in such classical fuzzy system, which is called sometimes Type-1 fuzzy logic system (T1FLS) is not fully exploited and can deliver a non-satisfactory perfor-mance. Practically, three ways of uncertainty can be observed in the fuzzy logic system (FLS): (1) the used words in antecedents and consequents of rules can mean different things to different people; (2) consequents obtained by polling a group of experts will often be different for the same rule and (3) both of training data and measurements used to activate the FLS are noisy ( Chafaa et al., 2007a, b ).
 another type of fuzzy system called Type-2 fuzzy logic system (T2FLS). In T2FLS, the uncertainty is represented using a function, which is itself a Type-1 fuzzy number and that is why T2FLS is referred to as fuzzy system. The membership functions of T2 fuzzy sets are three dimensional and include a footprint of uncertainty (FOU) with a new third dimension of Type-2 fuzzy sets. An FOU provides additional degrees of freedom that make it possible to directly model and handle uncertainties and consequently, T2FLS has the potential to outperform T1FLS ( Hagras, 2004; Mencattini et al., 2006 ) in such cases. Such advantage is quite important if we know that modelling of linguistic information and decision making represents the main application of FLS.
 because of their relative simpli city of implementation and their robustness against both plant uncertainties and external distur-bances. The tracking of the desired trajectory is achieved through two phases: an approaching phase, where the system is controlled to attain a pre-defined sliding surface, and a sliding phase along this surface ( Utkin, 1978; Slotine, 1984 ). Nevertheless, the commutation function, in the established control, requires an infinite switching of the control signal to maintain the system dynamics on the sliding surface. Due to the actuator limitations, signal delays and other factors prevent true slidin g, the occurrence of chattering phenomenon is highly probable. Among the proposed solutions to avoid this phenomenon, we might define a boundary layer around theslidingsurfacewithfixed( Slotine and Li, 1991; Huang and Kuo, 2006 )orvariable( Furuta, 1993; Lee and Oh, 1998 ) thickness, but this entails a larger response time, such that it is necessary to find a trade-off between the thickness of the boundary layer and the time response. Moreover to design the switching signal assuring the approaching phase , the upper bounds of both the external disturbances and the structural uncertainties must be well known. According to the ability of fuzzy systems and neural networks of replacing a continuous and bounded nonlinear function ( Wang and Mendel, 1992; Hornik et al., 1989 ), many approaches combining them with convention al controllers, especially SMC, have been proposed ( Lo and Kuo, 1998; Kaynak et al., 2001; Jezernik et al., 1997; Lin and Chen, 1997; Chan and Rad, 2001; Yu et al., 2003; Liang and Su, 2003; Manamanni et al., 2003; Guo and Woo, 2003; Yu et al., 2006; Yagiz and Hacioglu, 2009; Hamzaoui et al., 2004 ). The main idea is to approximate the system dynamics by two adaptive fuzzy systems and to synthesize the control law, using the variable structure theory. To study the global stability of the closed-loop system and to deduce the adaptati on laws, Lyapuno vtheoryhasbeen used. Despite the use of boundary layer to reduce the chattering phenomenon, the design of the switching signal remains unresolved. Some authors have proposed an approximation of the sliding gain by an adaptive fuzzy system to elimin ate the chattering phenomenon without requiring any particular knowledge about the upper bounds of both approximation errors and external disturbances ( Guo and Woo, 2003; Yu et al., 2006; Yagiz and Hacioglu, 2009; Hamzaoui in these approaches is guaranteed only for a good approximation parameters.

In this paper, we propose a robust adaptive fuzzy tracking control for a class of nonlinear systems b ased on the sliding mode control. fuzzy logic with the efficiency of SMC. The main contributions presented in this work are: (i) the sliding surface is modified such that the system will be on at t  X  0 .Thisallowsremovingthe approaching phase, and hence to overcome the knowledge of the upper bound of disturbances requ ired to guarantee the sliding condition and to eliminate effectively the chattering phenomenon, (ii) the used mathematical development permits to avoid the possible controller singularity problem and to overcome the control gain constraints encountered in th e classical adaptive fuzzy control laws, (iii) the resulting closed-loop system is proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking error can converge to the arbitrarily small neighbourhood of the origin, and (iv) whatever the number of used state variables and fuzzy rules, the adaptation algorithm uses a small number of parameters, which makes the proposed approach suitable for real time implementation. The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a description of Type-2 fuzzy logic systems. Section 3 is dedicated to the formulation and the investigation of the SISO system tracking control problem. In Section 4, we present the synthesis of the proposed controller, whose design procedure is explained in Section 5. In Section 6, the efficiency of the proposed approach is shown using a robot manipulator as a real time system. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper. 2. Type-2 fuzzy logic system
Generally, in engineering problems, we distinguish two types of information, objective and subjective knowledge. Objective knowl-edges are generally used in engineering problem formulations (e.g., mathematical equations of robot model). In contrast, subjective knowledges which represent linguis tic information like rules, expert information and design requirements are usually impossible to be quantified using traditional m athematics. Accordingly, two approaches have been proposed in the literature: (1) model-based approach, where the objective information is represented by mathematical models and (2) model free approach where subjective information is represented by ling uistic statements converted to rules. Using fuzzy logic (FL), the two forms of knowledge can be coordinated in a logical way. Furthermore, an FL can be applied to the same class of problems treated by feedforward neural networks (FFNN) approach, where subjective knowledge is not really exploited and sometimes it may be ignored. Logically, the solution of real problems will be more efficient using both types of knowledge mean of translating human expertise to a set of rules and hence, a fuzzy controller can be deduced ( Ying, 2000 ). The first approach relating to fuzzy control dealt with the so-called symbolic conclusion or Mamdani controller, which requires a large calculation time for rule aggregation and defuzzification ( Kimg and Mamdani, 1977; Reznik, 1997; Ross, 2004 ). Therefore, they cannot be used with fast systems subjected to seve re real-time constraints. Furthermore, these approaches are heuristic in nature and do not provide stability and robustness analysis. In the 1980s, a second fuzzy controller approach was developed by Takagi and Sugeno (TS) ( Takagi and Sugeno, 1985; are numeric and the controllers are formulated in an analytical form to be compatible with the classic tools of control theory, which makes models can be considered as a partic ular class of non-linear systems. Afterward, the universal approximator theorem was used by Wang to present an adaptive fuzzy TS-type controller, where the conclusions are updated online ( Wang, 1994 ). Eq. (1) represents an approximation of non-linear system f  X  x  X  ,usingtheTSfuzzymodel. f  X  x  X  X  y T x T  X  x  X  X  1  X  where y T is an adjustable parameter vector and x T is the regression vector, which is a function of system input x .

However, many fuzzy control applications nowadays suffer from uncertainty problem, which represent a serious challenge. For example, an uncertainty about the meanings of the words and consequents used in rules, measurements that activate the FLS, and data used to tune the parameters of the FLS. The T2FLS can resolve this problem efficiently, since it is capable of directly modelling the uncertainties and minimizing their effects.
The idea of Type-2 (T2) fuzzy sets were defined and discussed for the first time by Zadeh through proposing membership grades of a fuzzy set measured with linguistic terms ( Zadeh, 1975 ). During the period from 1975 to 1981, some researchers studied the basics of T2 fuzzy logic ( Mizumoto and Tanaka, 1981; Mizumoto and Zimmerman, 1976; Dubois and Prade, 1982 ). In ( Gorzalczany, 1987; T  X  urks -en, 1995; Schwarz, 1985; Klir and Folger, 1988 ), the authors promoted the use of T2 fuzzy sets, which was called interval-valued or IV fuzzy sets. Gorzalczany was the pioneer in the development of IVs fuzzy sets and gave diagrammatically the footprint of uncertainty (FOU) ( Gorzalczany, 1987 ). In ( Bustince, 2000 ), Bustince has obtained some results about approximate reasoning. In ( Karnik and Mendel, 1998c; Karnik and Mendel, 1998b; Karnik and Mendel, 2001 ), Karnik and Mendel defined the type-reduction and the notion of an output processing stage for T2FLS in these papers. In parallel with the development of type-reduction, there was significant work going on in developing the mathematics of T2FLS for a complete description of the fuzzy inference process. Meanwhile, John and
Czarnecki ( John and Czarnecki, 1999 ) published a series of review papers on T2FLS and since then, its application has been steadily growing. The block diagram of T2FLS, illustrated in Fig. 1 , consists of five components: fuzzifier, rule base, fuzzy inference engine, type-reducer and defuzzifier. The crisp inputs are first fuzzified, in general, into Type-2 fuzzy sets input, which will activate the inference engine and the rule base to produce Type-2 fuzzy sets output. This output is then processed by the type-reducer, which combines the output sets to get Type-1 fuzzy sets called the type-reduced sets ( Chafaa et al., 2007a, b ). To produce the crisp outputs, we can defuzzify the type-reduced fuzzy set. quently, an interval Type-2 fuzzy system (IT2FLS) will be adopted for its calculation simplicity and the even distribution of the uncertainty among all admiss ible primary memberships ( Liang and Mendel, 2000; Mendel and John, 2002 ). For this reason, an IT2FLS will be suitable for implementation in real time applications. More details on IT2FS are provided in Appendix A ( Liang et al., 2000; Mendel, 2001; Karnik and Mendel, 1998a; Karnik et al., 1999 ). system dynamics in order to construct the equivalent control law.
The adaptation laws of the tuneable parameters will be deduced from Lyapunov analysis to ensure the robustness and the stability of the proposed approach. 3.

The elements of x are assumed to be available for measurement. It is also assumed that the system remains in the forced region, and the analysis can be adapted easily for g  X  x  X  o 0. Accordingly, there noted that the parameter b is required only for the mathematical analysis, while its true value is needed neither for the simulation nor for the real time implementation of the controller. robust controller to force the system output to track a given bounded desired reference trajectory y d , i.e., the tracking error e  X  y d y must converge towards zero.

 sliding process includes two phases: the first is the approaching phase, when the sliding surface is non-zero value ( S a 0), and the second is the sliding phase, when the sliding surface equal to zero ( S  X  0). To ensure the robustness of the closed loop system, we consider the following sliding surface where the coefficients l i are chosen such as all the roots of the corresponding polynomial are located in the open left half plane.
A large value of the slop l i implies a fast system response. The classical sliding-mode approach results in the following control signal ( Slotine, 1984 ): u  X  u eq g 1  X  x  X  u sw ,  X  4  X  where u eq  X  g 1  X  x  X  f  X  x  X  X  y  X  n  X  d  X  u sw  X  K d sign  X  S  X  X  6  X  disadvantages such as: (1) the knowledge of both f  X  x  X  and g  X  x  X  functions, which is not (2) the presence of the unknown perturbation makes the (3) the use of the sign function in Eq. (6) provokes the chattering (4) the sliding surface given in Eq. (3) produces two major
The proposed approach has the objective to resolve these problems. 4. Proposed approach
In order to improve the dynamic performance of sliding mode controller, several studies have focused on the modification of the sliding surface by making it non-linear ( Lee and Youn, 1989; Tokat et al., 2003; Liu, 2005; Hussain et al., 2007; Hussain et al., 2008 ). In ( Lee and Youn, 1989 ), the expression of the surface consists of two parts, linear and nonlinear. However, this structure makes the implementation of controller more complex and affects system convergence to the surface. In the same context, Tokat et al. (2003) have modified the surface to be as an oblique form. Nevertheless, this work can certainly improve some dynamic performances, but at the expense of control law complexity and system sensitivity against external disturbances. In ( Liu (2005) , Hussain et al. (2007) , Hussain et al. (2008) , the authors propose the adaptation of l i value in function of the tracking error to obtain a trade-off between the applied control energy and time response. More precisely, they propose to use a nonlinear surface such that the system starts with deceleration (in the case where the tracking error is large) followed by acceleration (in the case where the tracking error is small). However, the system is still sensible to the uncertainties and perturbations during the approaching phase.

In this work, we propose a modification in the structure of the sliding surface so that it passes through the initial point at the initial time ( t  X  0).

The idea is to find an expression that allows us to put the system on the sliding surface at the initial time, which can be obtained if we consider the following sliding surface:
Accordingly, the proposed surface eliminates the approaching phase and replaces the disadvantages mentioned previously by two contributions 1. The solution of system sensitivity problem and fragile robust-ness during the approaching phase, since such phase is removed. 2. The reduction of convergence time as we have only the sliding phase.

The time derivative of Eq. (7) can be rewritten as _
Using Eq. (2), Eq. (8) becomes _
If f  X  x  X  and g  X  x  X  are known, then we can use the following control law: u  X  g 1  X  x  X  f  X  x  X  X  y  X  n  X  d  X  where K d is a positive scalar chosen by the designer, such that 9 d 9 o K d in order to guarantee that S _ S o 0. The term sign(S) represents the commutation function.

In the case where f  X  x  X  and g  X  x  X  are unknown and uncertain, and the scalar K d is difficult if not impossible, to calculate, the control law (10) cannot be used in this form. These constraints are avoided by using only one T2-FLS to approximate the unknown terms.
 According to Eq. (A11), the output of the FLS-T2 can be written as Y  X 
The previous equation can be written as h  X  x  X  X  f T c  X  x  X  X  12  X  where f  X  X  w T l , w T r T and c  X  x  X  X  1 2  X  x T l  X  x  X  , x T r  X  x  X  T :
This simplified structure will allow us to approximate the unknown dynamic and exploit easily the different adaptive techniques (direct and indirect). It is important to notify that we will use only one approximator to reduce both the computing time and the complexity of the implementation, while achieving an excellent approximation.

To study the global stability and deduce the adaptation law, we consider the following Lyapunov function: V  X  1 2 S 2  X  b 2 g ~ a 2  X  13  X  the estimation of the unknown variable a  X  b 1 : f : 2 and f is the conclusion vector of T2FLS, which will be used later. _ V  X  S _ S  X  b g ~ a _ ~ a  X  14  X  _ V  X  Sy  X  n  X  d f  X  x  X  g  X  x  X  u d  X 
Since the external perturbation is bounded ( 9 d 9 o K d ), the derivative of Lyapunov function verifies the following inequality: _ V r Sy  X  n  X  d f  X  x  X  g  X  x  X  u  X

Using the fact that S 2 2 r V  X  t  X  , we can conclude that lim which implies that lim Thus, it was shown that the error and the surface are bounded. By analyzing the expression of the control law, we note that it also remains bounded. Thus, the proposed approach ensures the boundness of all system variables (state, controller). In addition, the application of Barbalat lemma ( Wang, 1994 ) allows us not only to state that the error is bounded, but also it converges to zero when the time approaches to infinity. Subsequently, we have only the convergence of the sliding surface S to zero.
As demonstrated in Slotine and Li (1991) , the system is insensible to uncertainties and external disturbances, which allows the system to be robust against them. 5. Design procedure The control scheme of the proposed approach and the adaptive FWN diagrams are given, respectively, by Figs. 2 and 3 . According to the proposed method, the design procedure of the IT2FL based controller for an uncertain and disturbed non-linear n th order SISO system, whose nominal model is unavailable comprises the following two phases. 5.1. Off-line design phase 1. Specify the order of system to be controlled n and the desired trajectory for output variable, y d . 2. Determine the domain of variation of each variable (states), and hence the required fuzzy sets to cover this domain uniformly and equally. If the fuzzy set number is denoted by an FS , there will be J rules in the FWN rule base, where J  X  ( FS ) 3. For i  X  1, y , n 1, determine sliding surface coefficient l that Eq. (13) becomes stable Hurwitz polynomial. The role of
M 0 is a positive constant to allow bringing the surface to zero in the case when S a 0, so it would be sufficient to take 1 r M 0 r 5. The other control parameter is r , which affects both the learning rate and control action. Thus, it would be suitable to consider a unity value for this parameter, r  X  1.
Afterward, calculate the control law in Eq. (24). 4. Define the learning rates g required in the on-line adjustment of _ ^ a in Eq. (25). Chosen to be sufficiently large, 20 r g and according to the time constant of system to be controlled. 5.2. On-line calculation phase 1. Using the tracking error, calculate the sliding surface as in
Eq. (7). 2. Construct the IT2FS model using the system state vector x , then the regression vector c  X  x  X  to calculate _ ^ a in Eq. (25). 3. Deduce the control law using Eq. (24) and apply it to the plant described in Eq. (2).
 4. Update the adjustable parameter _ ^ a of the IT2FS approximator 5. Repeat the calculations for the next iteration by going to 6. Experimental results controller, a single-link robot manipulator equipped with a DC motor is considered.
 the following equation: x  X  3  X  1  X  f  X  x  X  X  g  X  x  X  u  X  t  X  X  d  X  t  X  ,  X  33  X  where f  X  x  X  r L x 3 g l cos  X  x 1  X  X  K b N 2 K t Lml 2 x 2 rg g  X  x  X  X  K t N Lml 2 , d  X  t  X  X  r Lml 2 d u  X  t  X  X  1 ml 2 is the inductance, K b  X  0.2 is the electromotive force constant, K Is the external unknown disturbance, which will be in the form of manual opposition to the link movement. The benchmark constructed for the experimentation is shown in Fig. 4, which includes mainly a dSPACE controller model 1104.

The objective is to control the angular position in two cases: regulation and tracking problems. 6.1. Regulation problem
In this case, the reference signal is constant (square wave with positive and negative values). The minimum value is 2.5, while the maximum value is 2.5. The signal repeat itself each 14 s with duty cycle equal to 50%. As we know, the derivative of this signal approaches to infinity in the ideal derivative. This problem is avoided using the following procedure.

The control objective is to bring the motor position from y time instant t i to the final time t f ) and with the least amount of overshoot. In order to have sufficiently smooth dynamics of velocity and acceleration (without discontinuity, electrical peak, or torque undulations), the following additional constraints are chosen: _ y  X  t i  X  X  _ y d  X  t f  X  X   X  y d  X  t i  X  X   X  y d  X  t f  X  X  0  X  34  X  Thus, the reference trajectory can be chosen as a fifth order polynomial equation: y  X  t  X  X  y i  X  X  y f y i  X  X  10 D 3 t 15 D 4 t  X  6 D 5 t  X  X  35  X  where D  X  X  t t i  X  =  X  t f t i  X  , t i  X  0 :
The transition of reference signal between its maximum and minimum values for t f  X  3 is shown in Fig. 5 .
 system. Since our system is third order, we have n  X  3. The reference signal is given in Fig. 6 . If we consider the maximum value of desired trajectory in Fig. 6, then the interval range of the actual system output in case of perfect tracking will belong always to the closed interval [ 2.5, 2.5]. To give some relaxation to our controller, the interval [ 3, 3] is considered as a universe of discourse for our IT2FS approximator. Accordingly, three membership functions can cover sufficiently each of the previous periods. Since our approximator has three inputs, there will be 27 rules. The sliding parameter is chosen as l 1  X  3 and l 2  X  2 to get stable roots (in the left half side). The constant M allows bringing the surface to zero in the case when S a 0, so we choose M 0  X  1. To select r value, we can see that 1/ r 2 affects the learning rate and also the control action. Furthermore, r depends on the system rapidity. For this case, we choose r  X  1. Concerning the learning rate g , we choose it to be 25 to ensure a fast approximation. It is important to notify that all the experimental results are obtained after leaving the motor running for, at least, 15 min. This period will warm up the electrical resistance and introduce, as a result, parameter uncertainty in the electrical resistance.
 shown in Figs. 7 X 11 . We remark from Fig. 7 that the system attains the reference points (2.5 and 2.5) and keep on these points for 6 s before switching to the other direction. Fig. 8 illustrate the error square of angular position, which is around 3%.
This good response is obtained thanks to the good convergence of an IT2FS. Fig. 9 shows the elocities (reference versus actual). The error square of angular velocity is depicted in Fig. 10 . The perfect sliding process is noticeable such that once the error (in position or velocity) attains zero, it stays there and if we modify the desired trajectory, then each IT2FLS will be adapted according to Eqs. (26) X (31) to rectify this effect and eventually error values will go again to zero. Fig. 11 also depicts the control action calculated using the proposed method, in which the chattering phenomenon and the abrupt variations appearing in classical sliding mode control are completely eliminated. 6.2. Tracking problem
Another test will be done in this s ection concerning the tracking problem. We will consider here that the reference signal is continuously varying over the time and given by y d  X  2 : 5sin  X  t  X  (sine wave with positive and negative values).

If we consider the same pervious control parameters, the obtained results will be as shown in Figs. 12 X 14 . The position a short response time. On the other hand, if we observe the tracking error given by Fig. 13 , we can easily conclude the tracking remains with an error percentage inferior of 3.5%. Different initial conditions are depicted in Figs. 15 and 16 . It can be stated easily that the actual position tracks rapidly the desired trajectory. Moreover external perturbation (with non-zero mean value) is considered using a relatively strong manual opposition trying to resist and even stop the manipulator as shown in Fig. 17 . It is clear that the effectiveness of the proposed controller makes the effect of such disturbance negligible. It is also important to remark that the required control action does not present chattering or any other form of discontinuity, which means that the objective of chattering phenomenon elimination is successfully satisfied for both regulation and tracking control problems.
 different manners: (1) between regulation and tracking for the same algorithm and (2) between this work and other algorithms in the literature.

Section 7. We have used the same maximum position (2.5 rad) and same minimum position ( 2.5 rad) to get more objective comparison between these two cases.
 factors: the output system error and the applied control action. state that regulation output error is about 3% ( Fig. 8 ), while it seems to be inferior to 2% in the tracking problem ( Fig. 13 ). action. In regulation, the control signal varies between 21 and 23 volts ( Fig. 11 ), while this variation belongs to the interval 20 and 20 volts in the tracking case as shown in Fig. 13 . problem is due to the difference in the nature of both problems.
In regulation, we have a sharp change (from initial point to the set point) with a specific time period (short in general), which may require a high control action to push the system from its actual place to the desired set point. This would imply an error, which is a little bit more than its equivalent in the tracking case. variation in set point. This variation is, generally, not brusque or abrupt, and hence the controller does not require a very fast reaction as in the regulation case. Moreover the continually smooth changing of reference signal helps the controller to adapt itself and drive carefully the system to the desired trajectory without an exciting system dynamic.

Cheng and Chien, 2006; Wang et al., 2010; Yau and Wang, 2009 ) will be considered here for comparison purpose. The authors of
Wang et al. (2001) approximate both the equivalent control term and switching-type control term in an SMC law. The stability is demonstrated using Lyapunov stability. We have applied the algorithm of Wang et al. (2001) to an inverted pendulum subjected to both parametric uncertainties and external perturbation. The results are shown in Figs. 18 X 20 .
 We refer to the algorithm of Wang et al. (2001) as  X  X  X liding Mode Control: Fuzzy SWitching X  X  or SMC X  X SW. In contrast, our proposed algorithm is referred to as  X  X  X liding Mode Control: Without Reaching Phase X  X  or SMC X  X RP.

The transient response illustrates a better convergence of our approach in terms of tracking speed for both angular position and velocity (Figs. 18 and 19. This can be justified by the improvements of system robustness against both parametric uncertainties and only minimized, but also free of hard reactions because we have s  X  0 at the initial time ( t  X  0).
 obtained due to the superior capacity of an IT2FLS in representing uncertainties and variations that have been neglected in T1FLS. system dynamics can be reflected in a better approximation of system controller, and hence a lower tracking error X  X . scheme capable of driving the dynamics of controlled system into a designed sliding surface in finite time with the guarantee of asymptotical stability property. Nevertheless, the used SMC law consists of two components depending on sliding surface value.
Each adaptation process should perform a verification operation to select the suitable parameter adaptation law, which may introduce additional calculations, and hence is more time consuming in real time implementation.
 stepping feedback is presented in Wang et al. (2010) to control chaotic system and guarantee the asymptotical tracking of the target orbit. In spite of this valuable contribution, the control law obtained by simulation shows some peaks and chattering, which may deteriorate the actuator. Furthermore, in Wang et al. (2001) , Cheng and Chien (2006) , Wang et al. (2010) , the reaching phase of an SMC is not eliminated and hence, the problem of system sensitivity to external perturbation and parametric variation during this phase still exist.
The authors of Yau and Wang (2009) propose a nonlinear controller capable of overcoming the trial-and-error tuning for membership functions and rule base in traditional fuzzy logic control. However, the trials are avoided in our approach, thanks to the sliding term which allows the initialization of adaptable parameters to zero.

Accordingly, the proposed approach in this paper presents additional improvements in terms of output error, time response and required control action. 7. Conclusion and future work
In this paper, a robust adaptive fuzzy tracking control for a class of nonlinear system based on sliding mode control has been presented. This approach allows guaranteeing both the uniformly, ultimately boundness of the resulting closed-loop system and convergence of the tracking error to a small neighbourhood of the origin. Furthermore, the approaching phase has been eliminated to reduce the constraint design encountered in the classical case and avoid the chattering phenomenon. The structure of the proposed control law permits to avoid the possible singularity problems due to using adaptive Type-2 fuzzy systems and to reduce efficiently the number of the involved parameters. Experimental results have shown that the proposed approach performs goods tracking performances and guarantees the control objectives for both regulation and tracking control problems. As a future work, we intended to realize a state observer in the case, where the system states are not available for measurement.
 Appendix A. Background knowledge on interval Type-2 fuzzy logic system A.1. Fuzzifier
The fuzzifier maps a crisp input vector with n inputs into input fuzzy sets, which can be, in general, T2 fuzzy input sets Mendel, 2000; Mendel and John, 2002; Liang et al., 2000 ). However, we will consider the singleton fuzzification as it is fast to compute, and thus suitable for real time applications. In the singleton fuzzification, the input fuzzy set has only a single point of nonzero membership ( Liang and Mendel, 2000; Mendel and John, 2002; Liang et al., 2000; Mendel, 2001 ). Thus, ~ A x is a T2 fuzzy singleton if m 1 = 1for x i  X  x 1 and m ~ A 2001 ).
 A.2. Rule base
For an IT2FLS with M , total number of IF X  X HEN rules in the rule base, the j th rule can be written as follows: R where V i X  j  X  X  are antecedent Type-2 sets, y A Y is the output, W consequent T2 sets. The rule in Eq. (A1) represents a T2 fuzzy relation between the input and the output spaces of the FLS. A.3. Fuzzy inference engine
In the considered IT2FLS, we will use the product operation ( Mendel, 2001 ). In an IT2FLS with minimum or product t -norm, set, which is determined by its left-and right-most points v j and v as in Eq. (A2).
 V  X  x 1  X  X  X  v j  X  x 1  X  , v j  X  x 1  X  X  v j , v j  X  A2  X  the previous equations such that: j  X  1, n  X  2, x 1  X  W 1  X  w 1 L , w 1 R  X  2 , 4  X  , v j  X  x 1  X  X  m vx Accordingly, the firing interval bounds for the j th rule of an v  X  x 1  X  X  m v j v  X  x 1  X  X  m v j the * operator denotes the product operation.
 A.4. Type-reduction the T2 output sets of the inference engine to a Type-1 set. The obtained type-reduced sets are then defuzzified to get crisp output. As indicated in Liang et al. (2000) , centre of sets (cos) type reduction will be considered because it requires less computation time than centroid and allows overcoming the problems encountered with simple height and modified height type-reductions in the case, where only one rule is fired ( Mendel, 2001 ). Type-reduction proposed by Karnik and
Mendel (KM) ( Karnik and Mendel, 1998a; Karnik et al., 1999 ) using the cos method is expressed in Eq. (A5) and is shown in Fig. A2 Y cos  X  W 1 , ... , W M , V 1 , ... , V M  X  X  where Y cos is the interval set determined by two end points y and y r  X  x  X  , w j A W j  X  w j L , w j R and v j A V j  X  X  v j , v j is the firing interval.
 A.5. Defuzzification determined by its left-most point y l  X  x  X  and right-most point y
Using the centre of gravity, the defuzzified crisp output for each output is given by Liang et al. (2000) , Mendel (2001) : Y  X  y l  X  y r 2  X  A6  X  basis functions (FBFs) expansion as follows: y l  X  x  X  X  where v j l denotes the firing strength membership grade (which could be either v j or v j ) contributing to the left-most point y l  X  x  X  x l  X  x  X  is the FBF vector of Y , such that x T l  X  x  X  X  X  x we have y r  X  x  X  X  v j r denotes the firing strength membership, which could be either v j or v j contributing to the right-most point y r that x r  X  x  X  is the FBF vector of Y , such that x T r  X  x  X  X  X  x the T2FLS can be given as follows:
