 Modeling the movement of information within social media outlets, like Twitter, is key to understanding to how ideas spread but quantifying such movement runs into several dif-ficulties. Two specific areas that elude a clear characteriza-tion are (i) the intrinsic random nature of individuals to po-tentially adopt and subsequently broadcast a Twitter topic, and (ii) the dissemination of information via non-Twitter sources, such as news outlets and word of mouth, and its impact on Twitter propagation. These distinct yet inter-connected areas must be incorporated to generate a com-prehensive model of information di  X  usion. We propose a bispace model to capture propagation in the union of (ex-clusively) Twitter and non-Twitter environments. To quan-tify the stochastic nature of Twitter topic propagation, we combine principles of geometric Brownian motion and tradi-tional network graph theory. We apply Poisson process func-tions to model information di  X  usion outside of the Twitter mentions network. We discuss techniques to unify the two sub-models to accurately model information dissemination. We demonstrate the novel application of these techniques on real Twitter datasets related to mass protest adoption in social communities.
 H.2.8 [ Database Management ]: Database Applications X  Data Mining Information di  X  usion; social networks; protests; geometric Brownian motion. In recent years social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook have provided not just a platform for communica-tion but also a means of mobilization and strategic interac-tion between key players of social movements, e.g., protests. Traditionally social movements occur within a subset of the population and have spread through on-the-ground commu-nities and unions. With the advent of leaner communication technologies like Twitter, the way such movements form and spread through modern society has changed. With Twitter, in particular, traditional slogans have transformed into hash-tags which can o  X  er a consistent way of communicating the reason and motivation of social movements like protests and uprisings.
 Figure 1: Mexico teacher protest events from Sep 1 to Sep 7, 2013. The blue pins denote protest cities; the numbers in red denote the sequence of protests as they spread across the country.

In this paper, we focus on Twitter X  X  user networks during protests and similar civil unrest activities in Latin Amer-ica. Our goals are to model the propagation and growth of contagion-like protest waves within a social network and to understand the social and structural dynamics underlying such phenomena. The key problem is understanding the na-ture of information propagation among motivated users of a social network. We have observed that such mass protests emerge very swiftly and sharply. In Twitterspeak, they would be considered trending but most such trends quickly decline on the social network even if not in the physical world. Modeling protest-related topic propagation on net-works involves several challenges.
First, social protest propagation through online media can spread over large areas more quickly than traditional meth-ods since users are geographically distributed. For example, on September 1, 2013, the Mexican government X  X  education reform bill drew the wrath of teachers country-wide who opposed the reform (which required regular assessments of their performance as educators). Twitter was a virtual loud-speaker, providing a platform for organization and strate-gization for teachers to put forth their arguments against the bill. A series of mass teacher protests erupted and spread from city to city. As shown in Fig. 1, we see the movement spreading over time to di  X  erent locations with no obvious visual mobilization pattern. The second challenge is that Twitter X  X  user network embodies many subgraphs based on social ties which might a  X  ord di  X  erent propagation rates due to subgraph-specific structures.
 Thus identifying how the cause of a protest is adopted by Twitter users and how mobilization happens in the under-lying network is a di cult task. To address this problem we present an integrated framework with new theoretical models as well as empirical validation on real Twitter data for actual protests witnessed in the recent past. Our key contributions are:
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 covers related work in the areas of social movements, infor-mation di  X  usion in networks, external influences, and Brow-nian motion. Section 3 proposes the geometric Brownian motion propagation mechanism. Section 4 introduces the bispace propagation model, especially the model of propaga-tion in latent space. In Section 5, we present our dataset and experimental setup, followed by initial experimental find-ings. Section 6 discusses the evaluation results for our ap-proach followed by a brief discussion in Section 7.
We briefly review related work next, which comes from multiple areas.
 Social movements: Oliver and Myers [18] develop a foun-dation for theoretical insights of social movements and de-scribe the limitations of simplified models. The Arab Spring of 2010 served as a context for many researchers [6, 2, 24, 4, 20] to study the role social networking sites play in the spread and recruitment of participants in protests. A de-tailed anatomy of modern social protests is described by Saad-Filho [20] with the June 2013 anti-government protests in Brazil as a context. In this work, we study the processes and sociological impacts of protests in the modern era, for-tified by online social networks and the communities in and around them.
 Information di  X  usion in networks: Previous studies have approached the modeling of information propagation and di  X  usion in social networks through several means, e.g., contagion models (SIR [3] SISa [10]), di  X  usion based thresh-old and cascade models [12], rise-and-fall patterns [13], cov-erage models [22], and survival theory [19]. A good survey of di  X  erent models of information di  X  usion is presented in [7]. External influences: We believe that the e  X  ects of influ-ences that originate external to the observed di  X  usion net-work, such as mass media and o  X  ine spread of information, can impact the way in which information flows within the on-line network. Myers et al. [14] study the emergence of URLs on Twitter with a probabilistic generative process using both internal and external exposure curves in a contagion-like model. Similar attention to the role of external factors is paid by Crane and Sornette [5] for tracking the popularity of YouTube videos using a di  X  usion model. Iwata et al. [11] use a shared cascade Poisson process model to discover la-tent influences in social activities such as item adoption. Using shared parameters among multiple Poisson processes, they were able to simulate sequences of item adoption events. Brownian motion: Zhou and colleagues (e.g., [26, 8, 27]) develop the notion of Brownian motion on networks which they use to discover communities of hierarchical structure both locally and globally. We extend this approach in this paper to formulate a propagation algorithm based on geo-metric Brownian motion (GBM). Borrowed from statistical physics, GBM has been used heavily in finance to model stock price movements. Scale invariance and the ability to model abrupt bumps along propagation paths are the pri-mary motivations for using GBMs to model stochastic pro-cesses [23].
 Our work builds on the concepts introduced in [8, 11, 26, 27] but di  X  ers from the other di  X  usion models described earlier by considering both the role of communities of users and the abrupt nature of propagation of volatile information such as mass social protests. We include the notion of bispace where both latent (attributed to external influences) and observed user network influences are considered. We infer propagation rates for communities in the observed network and allow implicit recruitment of users into protest actions through a Poisson process.
We model Twitter activity as a network G ( V, E ) of men-tions. Here, each vertex v 2 V represents a Twitter user. There is a directed edge from user v i to user v j if v i v in a tweet. We define ! ij to be the number of tweets in which user v i mentions user v j . Note that ! ij is not nec-essarily equal to ! ji . Key players such as celebrities and politicians are more likely to be mentioned by other users, rather than the other way around. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the mentions network is a directed graph. Weight w 14 is the number of times Twitter user v 1 mentions user v 4 , which is Figure 2: An example mentions network. Nodes de-note Twitter users, directed edges denote direction of mentions between users, and edges are labeled with mention frequency. 1, while w 41 is 6. Note that w 21 is 5, while w 12 is 0 (not shown).

We define the neighborhood N ( v i ) of a user v i as the set of all users mentioned by v i , i.e., those for whom there is a directed edge from v i . For each user v j 2 N ( v i ), we define the Brownian distance from user v i to v j to be Here,  X  ij is the number of common direct neighbors shared by user v i and user v j [27]. In Fig. 2, node v 1 and v 4 two common direct neighbors X  v 3 and v 5  X  X nd hence  X  14 is 2.

We use the bias coe cient 1 to heuristically weigh mentions that carry more impact. If v i mentions v j , mean-ing that ! ij &gt; 0, we believe this expresses v i  X  X  intention to propagate information to v j . Since v j may not know or care about v i and consequently may seldom or never mention v i the return mentions, measured by ! ji , are (up)weighted by . Furthermore, if v i and v j share neighbors in the mentions network, the two users may have a closer relationship than other users with no shared mentioned Twitter users, and thus this component is weighted by as well. A Laplacian-style (+1) correction is used when there are no counter men-tions or no mutual mentions. Note that for =1, d ij is an unbiased Brownian distance since ! ij , ! ji ,and  X  ij will have the same weight. Figure 3: Trust function. A threshold defines the transition between the pre-trust and trusted period.
Next we introduce the notion of a trust function S t which we use to model an individual user X  X  agreement with an idea as expressed in tweets. (The trust function S t is a function of the two entities between whom trust is modeled, but in this section we simplify the notation for ease of exposition.) We divide the trust process into a pre-trust period and a trusted period. In the pre-trust period, as a user receives new infor-mation, that user X  X  trust, S t , increases exponentially until S t reaches the trust threshold at time T th and enters the trusted period. In the trusted period, new information in-creases S t linearly. For simplicity, an individual user cannot revoke trust once this threshold has been crossed. In our Twitter mentions network, a user X  X  trust in a topic crosses the threshold when they have tweeted about it. During the pre-trust period, we model the trust function as follows (the coe cient  X  accounts for change in the average value of this stochastic process):
We then add a Wiener process W t to account for stochas-ticity. According to the properties of a Wiener process [17], dW t is essentially Gaussian white noise and contributes to our equation as: In this way, we modeled the trust function S t as a geomet-ric Brownian motion (GBM) process which is a continuous-time stochastic process [17]. Per convention, we call  X  the drift and the volatility. The drift represents deterministic trends while the volatility refers to the influence of unpre-dictable events in this model [25]. For simplicity, we consider  X  and to be constant during the pre-trust period in this paper. (Our concern here primarily is with this period.)
According to It  X o X  X  theorem [17], given the initial value S the above stochastic di  X  erential equation has the following analytic solution: The above solution for S t is a log-normally distributed ran-dom variable with expected value and variance given as [17]: S is a geometric Brownian motion stochastic process, which is typically denoted as B (  X , ). In this paper we use an initial trust of S 0 = 1 without loss of generality.
Suppose that user v i posts a protest-related tweet at time t which indicates that v i has been recruited or infected. Whether v i will infect its neighbor v j depends on v j  X  X  trust function with v i . For instance, if v j is a close friend of v then it is more likely that v j will be infected in a short time because of v j  X  X  trust in v i . But if v j is not a very close friend of v i , then it might take a long time to build v j  X  X  trust with v and to accept v i  X  X  status. Only after v j  X  X  trust with v crosses some threshold, v j gets infected.

For better quantitative analysis, we consider d ij to be the trust threshold. After crossing this threshold, v j will agree with v i  X  X  opinion. According to the properties of GBMs, the trust function S t grows continuously over time. This implies input : mentions network G ( V, E ), time step t , output : infected users for each infected user v i 2 V do end t=0; for t  X  T do end that, if some user is infected, all of that user X  X  neighbors will eventually get infected given enough time for di  X  usion.
Since we assume a user cannot revoke trust, his or her status will never change once infected. Based on the above assumptions, we now detail our process for GBM propaga-tion through the mentions network; see Algorithm 1. Since GBM is a time-continuous stochastic process, we discretize time using time steps of duration t each. At the start of the simulation, all infected users are considered as newly in-fected users. Assume that the complete mass protest prop-agation duration is T . Once a user v i becomes infected, the node is marked as a newly infected user, and the new status begins to a  X  ect the statuses of the neighbors, i.e., N ( v For each user v j 2 N ( v i ), we use t ij = 0 to initialize the time instant from which v i begins to a  X  ect v j . After all the time variables t ij of N ( v i ) are so initialized, user v is updated to reflect that v i is no longer a newly infected user, to avoid duplicate initializations.

Suppose that at current time t , v j  X  X  trust with v i is de-noted as S ij t . According to the GBM properties, ln ( S a Gaussian variable given by:
If at time t , ln ( S ij t ) d ij , this means that v j gets infected since v j  X  X  trust with v i is bigger than the distance d v begins to a  X  ect his or her own neighbors. Instead at time is still a Gaussian variable, but with higher expectation and variance: Figure 4: Bispace propagation model. In the latent space, users infections are explained by a Poisson model, and the red nodes denote the infected users from one time step to another. In the mentions network space, users are infected according to the GBM model. Here, the purple nodes (a, b, c, d, e) denote user infections explained by the GBM model.
We use past protest events in which Twitter played a sig-nificant role in propagation to train our GBM model param-eters. For each user who gets infected we record their Brow-nian distance and infection time. Suppose v j gets infected by v i after time t ij ; then as per our propagation model, we claim that v j  X  X  trust function S ij t with v i holds: where d ij is the Brownian distance from v i to v j . For the convenience of parameter estimation, we can assume that ln ( S ij t )= d ij . It then follows that d ij is a normally dis-tributed random variable which can be expressed as: Because during the parameter estimation process, for each infected user v j , we are not interested in exactly which user gets v j infected, we use x j = d ij , and  X  j = t ij in the following part of this section for simplicity. The set of n users that are infected during the infection process have independent infection rates, and we get the following likelihood function: L (  X  , 2 | v 1 ,...,v n )=
The optimal estimators can be obtained by maximizing the above likelihood function. We di  X  erentiate the natural logarithm of the likelihood function above in terms of  X  and , and set them to zeros. By solving the two equations simultaneously, we obtain the optimal estimators  X   X  and  X 
Many information di  X  usion models assume that propaga-tion occurs over a single domain. However, it is hard to build a complete, exhaustive network of interactions. For instance, consider building a network based only on which Twitter users follow which other users. This network will miss interactions such as retweets and mentions and the ef-fect of influences originating outside of Twitter. Therefore, considering only a single space will make it di cult to ac-count for all possible factors that influence the spread of information. In this study, we propose a bispace di  X  usion Figure 5: Major communities of teacher protest events (Sep 1 to Sep 12, 2013, Mexico).
 Figure 6: Key graph properties of communities un-derlying the Mexican teacher protest events. model that accounts for two domains of di  X  usion: the ob-served social network and the latent space, as can be seen in Fig. 4. In our case, the observed user space is the Twit-ter mentions network, whereas the latent space refers to any interactions outside of this network. To account for varying di  X  usion dynamics, each space is intended to have its own propagation model. As described earlier, we model propaga-tion through the Twitters mentions network as Geometric Brownian motion. We use the Poisson distribution to de-scribe information propagation in the latent space.
Within networks, a community refers to the appearance of densely connected groups of vertices, with sparse connec-tions between each group [16]. Instead of treating the whole network as a single propagation space, we use network struc-ture to further split the network into communities. For our mentions network we use the Louvain method [1] for com-munity detection to split the network into groups of users. For each community of users we can calculate classical graph features such as average degree, diameter, density, and clus-Figure 7: Poisson distribution in latent space prop-agation. (a) shows the raw data outside of the men-tions network of teacher protest events on Sep 3, 2013. (b) shows the probability distribution of the number of infections. tering coe cient with which we can characterize them. In Fig. 6 we plot several features for each of the 8 communities found in the case study of Mexican teachers protest of 2013. Diameter r =max dist ( v i ,v j ) is the length (in number of edges) of the longest geodesic path between any nodes v i and v j [15]. The clustering coe cient c i is the proportion of node v i  X  X  neighbors that are connected. Graph density is is the number of nodes [21]. As shown in Fig. 6, diameter and graph density vary considerably.

With the observed network further split into several com-munities, each community is intended to have its own model parameters for GBM. In GBM, ln ( S ij t ) is a Gaussian distri-bution N ((  X  2 2 ) t, 2 t ). We assume that each user within a community shares the same  X  and so that each community has its characteristic  X  and . As information propagates through the mentions network, it may pass through di  X  er-ent communities. For an infected user v i and one of the non-infected neighbors v j 2 N ( v i ), we assume the following propagation strategy: At each time step we use the  X  and of any given node X  X  current community for propagation from that node.
As mentioned before, in the latent space, we are modeling unobserved interactions of users. Since there are so many factors that might a  X  ect the dissemination of information, such as news outlets, word-of-mouth, it is reasonable to as-sume that the probability of the number of newly infected users in a given time interval satisfies the Poisson distribu-tion [9] in the latent space.

For each node in the mentions network, it can only be infected by the GBM process. However, for those isolated users outside the mentions network, it is only possible that they get infected via the mechanics of the Poisson process. (Recall that in the GBM process, users get infected primarily via their neighbors.) We use X to represent the number of infected users with time interval t and so the probability of the infected users is given by: To obtain an estimator of , we can only use information about Twitter users who are outside the mentions network as our training dataset. We count the infected users outside the mentions network with time interval of 15 minutes dur-ing the Mexican teachers protest, and plot them as shown in Fig. 7(a). Adequately modelable by a Poisson distribution, we use the average value as the estimate of . Fig. 7(b) de-picts the Poisson distribution fit with  X  =4 . 18. If there are M 0 isolated users, the probability of each of these users to get infected in time interval t is /M 0 . To summarize, for any user not in the mentions network, infection is only possi-ble via the Poisson process. For a user who is already in the mentions network, infection can only happen via the GBM process over the mentions network, as described earlier.
The study described in this paper uses two datasets: (i) a gold standard report (GSR) of social unrest events in Latin America provided by MITRE that we use to define major mass protest events, and (ii) tweets collected over 14 months from May 2012 to September 2013 from 20 Latin American countries.

The GSR documents each civil unrest event by location, date, type of protest, and specifies the national news arti-cles that first reported the event. For protests that were prominent on Twitter, the GSR news articles often report hashtags which were used by protestors on social media. We selected only those GSR events for which we were able to find such hashtags. This process resulted in 64 unique hash-tags related to 40 di  X  erent protest that occurred in Latin America since May 2012. In Table 1 we list a few of these events from our study.

Our Twitter dataset was built by querying Datasift X  X  stream-ing API. Each tweet payload includes crucial metadata along with the tweet X  X  content. Though tweets from GPS-enabled devices include geographic coordinates, the percentage of such tweets in the collected sample was too low to be useful.
For this study, we further filtered tweets by removing those that do not contain hashtags relevant to a specific protest. Since most tweets do not have location data, we es-timate their location by geocoding the tweet based on each tweet X  X  content and properties of its user. We developed our own geocoding library that uses the World Gazetteer (http://archive.is/srm8P) database to lookup location names and geographic coordinates. Tweets can be geocoded to the user X  X  location at the time of tweeting or a location of inter-est about which the user is tweeting. We focused on event ge-Figure 8: Brownian distance vs propagation time for teacher protest events. olocation, which looks for location or landmark names, such as Plaza de la Independencia or Quito, Ecuador ,inatweet X  X  text. We generated a list of 2000 landmarks by extracting place names mentioned in GSR events which had high mu-tual information to civil unrest. In cases where no event location was found in a tweet X  X  text, we use geo-coordinates or self-reported location string in the tweet X  X  metadata.
Using the above pipeline we were able to extract and ge-olocate 20 , 227 , 830 unique users to build our mentions net-work from the filtered tweets that were spread over daily sub-networks.
For each of our mass protest events, we filter by its spe-cific keywords (hashtags) to obtain a set of relevant tweets and construct a mentions network from those tweets. We assume that information propagates from an initial infected user to other users through the network from one node to its neighbors. We build an adjacency matrix based on the mentions network and simulate the propagation using the GBM di  X  usion process as follows: 1. Brownian distance: The Brownian distance is in-2. Propagation speed: To evaluate our dynamic GBM Figure 9: GBM and Poisson propagation simulation for Yosoy protests (Mexico) on May 19, 2012.
We were also able to observe the variation in  X  and as community structure varies. In particular, community features like graph density and diameter as shown earlier in Fig. 6 may impact GBM propagation. We experimented with two modeling approaches: (i) one set of parameters for the whole network and (ii) di  X  erent parameters for each community in the network. We ran simulations for both these situations, and plotted the results of the whole net-work vs. community-specific approach in Figs. 9, 10, and 11. Comparing these simulation results, we find the community approach performs better, especially at capturing peak val-ues. Taking a closer look at Fig. 12, we observe that propa-gation time and speed of infection are di  X  erent for each com-munity and we are able to simulate local propagation more accurately, which can be seen, e.g., from Fig. 10(b), where the GBM with community method can simulate the burst propagation e  X  ectively, while the general GBM method (see Fig. 10(a)) fails to capture the exact peak time.
We use the following steps to calculate the properties of the latent space for each event. 1. Latent space: The intent is to consider all possi-Figure 10: GBM and Poisson propagation simula-tion for teacher protests (Mexico) on Sep 1, 2013. 2. Normalize: Twitter user activity varies based on time 3. Train: Using one week X  X  data split into 15 minute
We present an exhaustive evaluation of our bispace simu-lation approach alongside various dimensions next: Recall that the bispace modeling is comprised of two in-dependent process: the GBM simulation in the mentions network, and the Poisson process within the latent space. Given an initial mentions network, after training the GBM parameters of  X  and , we proceed to conduct the GBM sim-ulation. After estimating the Poisson parameter , we are able to do the Poisson simulation within latent space. We see that the GBM model is capable of capturing many mass protest scenarios, to the order of magnitude. Even though it cannot simulate the propagation speed accurately at every Figure 11: GBM and Poisson propagation simula-tion for Colombia protests on Dec 4, 2012. time point, the method is e  X  ective at capturing the total number of infected nodes with an accuracy of [0 . 78 , 0 . 95], as shown in Fig. 14. Fig. 9 depicts the analsis of the YoSoy132 student movement, whose Twitter activity is generally tortuous, and the curve is full of surges and bursts. From Fig. 9 we see that the bis-pace model is capable of simulating the general surge trends. Comparing the bispace simulation results with ground truth, we can see at many time points, the bispace simulation matches the ground truth. Fig. 11 shows the second protest of people protesting against the government in Colombia; here the Twitter activity depicts a burst at a single time point which is hard to capture. We can see the bispace model did show there is a burst, but not at the precise time point, one of its current limitations. After numerous experiments, we plot the accuracy distribu-tion of both approaches for all our mass protest situations in Fig. 14. Although the accuracies are sometimes inter-spersed, we can see that in overall the community model generally has a higher accuracy. In addition to comparing the simulated counts of tweets over time with ground truth values, we can also compare the Figure 12: Normalized mass-protest propagation speed for major communities during teacher protest events.
 Figure 13: Total tweets over time from Sep 2 to Sep 11, 2013 (Mexico). propagation path generated by the simulation against the actual propagation path through the mentions network. In Fig. 15 we can obtain a sense of the type of infection net-work bispace modeling creates as compared with the actual network. The simulation produces networks with relatively accurate paths and relevant characteristics as shown in Ta-ble 2. The component to which a user belongs is that of neighbors who can be reached from connected paths run-ning along edges of the graph [15]. From Figs. 9, 10, 11, by observing the blue dashed line (Pois-son) and red dashed line (GBM), we can see that the Poisson process shows a mild activity, while the GBM model serves as the dominant component which can capture the moments of key surges.

In this paper, we have characterized mass protest propa-gation using a bispace model comprising an observed men-tions network space and a latent space. We have introduced a trust function to simulate propagation in observed space using a geometric Brownian motion di  X  usion process which can be further extended to support communities with di  X  er-ent propagation parameters per community. We considered the latent space of all interactions outside the mentions net-work to be a Poisson distribution process. We have shown how the GBM di  X  usion model o  X  ers a new approach for modeling propagation through social networks like Twitter. Through our experiments, we find that the time required for spread of protest information through such networks is dependent on the network X  X  substructures. Furthermore, we find that modeling the di  X  usion process on a community basis provides better results than the assumption that all nodes in the network spread information in the same way.
In future work, we hope to further characterize the hidden network with the goal of uncovering specific latent variables. Additionally, we envision applying the GBM model to other networks, such as the Twitter follower network, to identify those paths most susceptible to information dissemination. Finally, we desire to compare propagation of mass protest language against other themes, such as celebratory events, to aid in determining correlations between topic or sentiment and the resulting social media di  X  usion.
