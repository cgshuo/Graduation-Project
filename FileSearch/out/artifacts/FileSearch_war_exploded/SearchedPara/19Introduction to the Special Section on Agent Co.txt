 We are pleased to bring you the Special Section on Agent Communication in this issue of ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST). The section contains three high-quality articles which we believe will serve to advance the field. The article were selected following the stringent review process that one would expect of a leading journal.

Researchers in software engineering are increasingly concerned with the issues of building robust open systems that are constituted from multiple autonomous agents. Agent communication research focuses on the insight that the right way to go about building such systems is by modeling the interactions among agents. In the past, this led to research on all-purpose agent communications languages. Now, it is driving research on protocol specification. Where agent communication really distinguishes itself is in the nature of the challenges with which it is concerned. How should we specify protocols so that agents can enact them flexibly? How can we engineer protocols effectively? How can we ensure that protocols meet stakeholder requirements? How do we ensure interoperability during distributed enactment? Research on protocols is especially relevant given emerging trends that point to the adoption of standardized protocols in communities of practice such as finance and healthcare.

The articles selected address some of these challenges. The article by Chopra et al. is a collection of individual manifestos by some of the leading active researchers in the agent communication. Each author provides insight on some of the pressing challenges for the area. Notably, the researchers agree on some broad points, chief among them that communication must have a social semantics. The article by Gerard and Singh addresses the engineering of protocols. They define a refinement relation among protocols and present a tool that can check for refinement. Baldoni et al. propose specifying the meaning of protocol messages separately from the flow between messages in order to facilitate greater reusability of protocols. All three article are essential steps towards the idea of protocols as first-class software engineering artifacts. All of them reaffirm the importance of social commitments in specifying the meaning of communication. The emphasis on meaning has the potential to fundamentally alter the way we look at the software engineering of distributed systems.

We hope that the readers will find the selection of articles interesting. Our higher purpose behind this section was to bring some clarity and a sense of direction to the field and to position agent communication as an exciting area of research. Indeed, as the articles demonstrate, the opportunities are virtually limitless.

We would like to thank TIST Editor-in-Chief Qiang Yang for giving us the opportunity to edit this special section, his assistant Weike Pan for helping us navigate the editing process, and the reviewers for turning in high-quality reviews. We would also like to thank Marco Colombetti, Nicoletta Fornara, Andrew Jones, Munindar Singh, and Pinar Yolum for their helpful suggestions.
