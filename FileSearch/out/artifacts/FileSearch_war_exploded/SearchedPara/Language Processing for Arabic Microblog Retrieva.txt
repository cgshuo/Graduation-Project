 The use of social media has profoundly affected social and political dynamics in the Arab world. In this paper, we explore the Arabic microblogs retrieval. We illustrate some of the challenges associated with Arabic microblog retrieval, which mainly stem from the use of different Arabic dialects that vary in lexical selection, morphology, and phonet ics and lack orthographic and spelling conventions. We present some of the required processing for effective retrieval such as improved letter normalization, elongated word handling, stopwor d removal, and stemming.

Social media has been instrumental in facilitating the launch of the so-called  X  X rab Spring X . The penetration of social media has been steadily increasing. The number of Facebook users in the Arab countries is estimated to be 42.4 million, representing 14.8% of the population. This number has increased by 10% between September 2011 and February 2012 1 . We estimate the number of Arabic microblogs, a.k.a. tweets, on Twitter to be in excess of 2 million tweets per day (based on continuous querying on Twitter). 
With the increasing adoption of social media, there is a growing need for effective retrieval of relevant social content. This need has prompted the creation of the Microblog track in the 2011 Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). The track has focused exclusively on retrieving English tweets. The track X  X  main task involved finding up to 30 relevant tweets per topic for 50 topics from roughly 5 million Engl ish tweets [12]. 
In this paper, we focus on the required processing for effective retrieval of Arabic microblogs, specifically Arabic tweets from Twitter. We use  X  X weet X  and  X  X icroblog X  interchangeably in the paper. Arabic tweets show many interesting linguistic phenomena that warrant special handlin g. These phenomena include: 
In this paper, we explore the e ffect of some of these phenomena on information retrieval in the context of a collection of 112 million Arabic tweets that we collected from Twitter with an associated set of 35 topics and th eir relevance judgments. We test the effectiveness of state-of-the-art Arabic retrieval techniques, which are mostly geared for MSA, including orthographic and morphological processing. We in troduce orthographic processing that is better suited for Arabic microblog text. Such processing includes improved characte r normalization, elongated and shortened word handling, expanded stopword removal with stopwords for different Arabic dialects, and stemming. 
The contribution of this paper is as follows: 
Though most Arabic speakers ca n read and understand MSA, they generally use different Arabic dialects in their daily interactions. With the spread of online social interaction in the Arab world, these dialects started finding their way to written online social interaction. There are 6 dominant dialects, namely Egyptian, Moroccan, Levantine, Iraqi, Gulf, and Yemeni. Aside from those, there are many more Arabic dialects along with variations within them [17]. The pronunciations of different letters are often different in different dialect. One of the letters with most variation in pronunciation is  X   X  (q 2 ) X . In MSA, it is typically pronounced similar to the English  X  X   X  as in  X  X uote X . However, it is pronounced as an  X  X  X  in Egyptian and Levantine (as in the  X  X lpine X ), as a  X  X a X  in Gulf (as in  X  X avel X ), and as a  X  X h X  in Sudanese (as in  X  X hana X ). Phonet ic variations sometimes affect the way people spell words in microblogs. For example, the word  X   X  X  X  X  X   X  (nZAfp) meaning  X  X leanliness X  is often written as  X   X  X  X  X  X   X  (nDAfp) to match the Egyptian dialect. Different dialects introduce new function words (usually stopwords) that don X  X  exist in MSA. For example, the MSA word  X   X  X  X  X   X  (hk*A)  X  meaning  X  X ike this X   X  is expressed as  X   X  X  X   X  (kdh),  X   X  X  X   X  ($*y), and  X   X  X  X   X  (hyk) in the Egyptian, Gulf, and Levantine dialects respectively. 
In what follows are other noteworthy aspects that we do not handle in this paper. One such aspect affects lexical choices of dialects and the frequent borrowing from English and French. Different dialects make different lexical choices to express the same concepts. For example,  X  X  want X  is expressed as  X   X  X  X  X  (EAwz) X  in Egyptian,  X   X  X  X  X  (|bgy) X  in Gulf, and  X   X  X  X  (bdy) X  in Levantine. The most popular MSA form is  X   X  X  X  X  (|ryd) X . 
Different dialects introduce new morphological patterns that don X  X  exist in MSA. For example, Egyptian and Levantine Arabic use a negation construc t similar to the French  X  X e-pas X  negation construct. The word  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  (mlEbt$) X , meaning  X  X id not play X , is composed of  X  X + lEbt +$ X . Such morphological constructs almost exclusively affect verbs. A more elaborate treatment of Arabic dialects and their processing can be found in [5, 17]. 
There are several orthographic feat ures that are found in Arabic microblogs, including: 
All these issues, some of wh ich are not unique to Arabic, complicate retrieval and we attempt to handle them in this paper. Most studies are based on a single large collection from the TREC-2001/2002 cross-language retrieval track [4, 10]. The studies examined indexing using words, word clusters [7], morphological analysis [4, 7], a nd character n-grams [4]. The effects of normalizing alterna tive characters and removing diacritics and stopwords have also been explored [4]. The studies suggest that light stemming, char acter n-grams, and statistical stemming are the best index terms. Since Arabic morphology is ambiguous, stemming attempts to remove the most likely clitics (prefixes and suffixes) and to c onflate inflected word forms and some derivational forms. An Ar abic stemmer of 97.1% accuracy was shown by Darwish et al. [1] to lead to statistical improvements over using light ste mming. Diab [2] used an SVM classifier, trained on the Arabic Penn Treebank, to ascertain the optimal segmentation for a word in context with an accuracy of 99.2%. Although consistency is more important for IR applications than linguistic correctness, improved correctness would naturally yield to greater c onsistency. In this paper, we used a system akin to Diab [2] as a baseline. We are not aware of any previous work on Arabic social search or microblog search. 
Interest in microblog retrieval has increased in recent years, with microblogs being used in a variety of tasks. For example, [15] used tweets as a news source and compared them to other online news media. Phelan et al. [13] used tweets to recommend news to users. Naveed et al. [9] illustrated the challenges of microblog retrieval, where documents are very short and typically focus on a single topic. Taveen et al. [16] compared microblog queries to web queries. They found microblog queries usually represent a user X  X  interest to find updates about a given event or personality as opposed to finding relevant pages about a topic. Recently, TREC introduced a Microblog track focused on English microblog retrieval [12]. The track provided a collection of about 14 million tweets with a set of 50 topics and their relevance judgments. The task was to search the English subset of the collection (roughly 5 million tweet s) for relevant tweets. The evaluation metric used for evaluation was precision at 30 (P@30), which was picked based on the assumption that users usually checks no more than 30 tweets per query. Generally, simpler retrieval approaches performed at par or better than more sophisticated ones [12]. The be st approaches included using pseudo relevance feedback and si mple ranking features, such as term frequency, inverse document frequency, and tweet length [8, 11]. Other methods that used natural language processing did not significantly impact results [18] . Wei et al., [18] used: word compression for removing three or more repetitions of a character in a word; slang word translation, which replaced dialectic terms with proper English ones using a slang dictionary; spell checking using aspell; and repl acement of OOV terms with similar English words, where similarity was based on character and phonetic edit distance, and contextual features . Although previous work showed that such processing was effective in correcting such erroneous words in tweets [6], [18] did not report significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness due to su ch processing. In this paper, we explore the use of similar linguist ic processing for Arabic tweets. 
The collection contains a little over 112 million Arabic tweets that were scraped from Twitter be tween Nov. 20, 2011 and Jan. 9, 2012. We collected the tweets by issuing the query  X  X ang:ar X  against Twitter. For topics, we randomly picked 3,000 tweets to guide query construction. They gave a general indication of the topics in the collection. We formulated 35 topics, with each topic having a title query and a releva nt exemplar. The queries ranged in length between 2 and 5 words with an average query length of 3.2 words. Consider the example query: 
For relevance judgments, we ma nually judged all top 30 results for all our runs. Duplicate or near duplicate results were eliminated, and judgmen ts were propagated from judged tweets to all duplicate or near duplicate tweet s. We deemed two tweets to be duplicates (or near duplicates) if the edit distance between the two tweets was less than 10% of the length of the shorter of the two tweets. Prior to computing the edit distance, we tokenized the tweets using our custom tokenizer, and we removed URL X  X , name mentions, hashtags, punctuati ons, emoticons, and symbols indicating laughter (such as lol). We made binary judgments of either 1 or 0 for 19,824 query-document pairs (566 per query on average), with an average of 267 relevant tweets per topic. 
The Arabic alphabet consists of 28 letters. However, 8 additional characters are used in the Arabic text, and they Title query:  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  ( Internet Freedom ) Relevant exemplar: Author ID : free_moment; Tweet ID : 145401039397453824; Date : Sat Dec 10 10:14:43 AST 2011;

Translation : (Ma X  X n News Agency: European Union: General guidelines for internet freedom will be announced soon) represent variant forms of some of the letters in the Alphabet or common replacements. These include: 
Though their use depends on the morphology and context of the word, they are often erroneously used interchangeably.  X  alef maksoura  X   X  (Y) X , which is a form of alef , but is often confused in writing with the letter ya  X   X  (y) X .  X  ta marbota  X   X  (p) X  which is often confused with ha  X   X  (h) X . used interchangeably depending on the role of a word in the sentence. Consider  X   X  X  X  X  X  (smA&amp;h) X ,  X   X  X  X  X  X  (smA X  X ) X , and  X   X  X  X  X  X  (smA}h) X   X  meaning  X  X is sky X   X  where  X  X ky X  is used as subject, object, or idafa (possessive construct) respectively. Hence, the following normalizations are effective: Alef : {  X  ,  X  ,  X  }  X   X  ; Hamza : {  X  ,  X  }  X   X  ; Alef maksoura : {  X  }  X   X  ; Ta Marbota : {  X  }  X   X 
Additionally, there are characters that require removal, namely:  X  Kashida which is used for decorative word elongation.  X  Optional diacritics, which represent short vowels in Arabic. 
Except for the normalization of the different hamza forms, such processing was shown to be effective in the literature. The normalization hamza was shown to be effective in unpublished work and is commonly used in web search engines. We will henceforth refer to this proc essing as  X  X asic normalization X . 
Basic normalization may not be sufficient for improved retrieval effectiveness for Ar abic microblogs. An extended normalization steps are proposed to achieve better effectiveness. Unlike MSA, Arabic microblog text sometimes contains non-Arabic characters for decoration ( X   X   X  X  X  X   X   X ). These additional characters are typically borro wed from Farsi and Urdu. We examined 10% of the tweets in the collection, and we made a list of all unique characters in th e sub collection. We assigned mapped characters that were ne ither Arabic nor punctuation to Arabic characters. The top 10 such characters and their mappings are in Table 1. The full list of unique characters contained more than 2,000 non-Arabic characters, with half of them appearing less than 10 times. Only 385 of them could be mapped to Arabic characters. The remaining characters were mapped to null as they represented decorative diacritics and unrecognized characters. Table 1: Frequent non-Arabic characters and their mappings 
In many languages, words in microblogs are routinely elongated by repeating some of the characters in the word to express emotions or importance. For ex ample, you may find words such as  X  X ooooooool X  and  X  X oooool X  in English tweets. In Arabic microblogs, we observed two re lated phenomena in tweets: 
We developed an algorithm to handle these two cases. Given a word in the tweet W , a compressed form of it C is generated by omitting any repetition in characters. A compressed form C represent a class that contains all surface forms of words W leads to the same compressed form C i . For example, the words: {cool, cooooool, coool, coolllllll, col}, will all have the compressed form  X  X ol X , that will act as a class including them all. All words in the tweet collection are classified according to their compressed form, and the most frequent surface form with each compressed form is saved in a hash table. Handling elongations and compressions for a word W i works as follows: 
In our experiments, we constr ucted the MSA dictionary from a collection of 349k articles from Aljazeera.net news site. We used articles from Aljazeera.net, because they rarely have misspellings. 
Table 2 shows an exampl e of a set of words that have the same compressed form. As shown in Ta ble 2, the first two terms are correct MSA words. Hence, they will be kept as is. Other terms are invalid terms. Therefore, they will be replaced with the most frequent term in the table whenever seen in a tweet or a query. Below is an example before and after applying the algorithm: 
All experiments were performed on the aforementioned collection of 112 million tweets. We performed 7 runs as follows: -Baseline runs : Norm : only basic normalizat ion is performed. 
Stem : basic normalization and statistical stemming are performed. Char4g : character 4-grams are used instead of words with basic normalization. -New runs : NormD : extended normalization is performed. 
StemD : extended normalization and statistical stemming are performed. NormDS : same as NormD with stopwords removed. StemDS : same as StemD with stopwords removed. 
Statistical stemming was performed using a reimplementation of the tokenizer in [2]. We construc ted a stopword list that combines both 162 MSA stopwords that we acquired from the University of Neuch X tel 3 and 90 dialectic stopwords. To identify the dialectic stopwords, all the words in the tweet collection were sorted according to their document frequency and we manually examined the top 200 words to determine if they were indeed stopwords or not. The dialectic st opwords included words such as  X   X  X  X  X  (Ally) X  (meaning  X  X hat X ) and  X   X  X  (m$) X  (meaning  X  X ot X ). 
We used SOLR (ver. 4.0), which is built on top of Lucene, to perform all experimentation. We used the OKAPI-BM25 ranking Table 2: Different incarnations of the word  X   X  X  (Allh) X   X  X  11 , 304 , 952 beautiful Yes  X  X  X  645 , 560 God Yes  X  X  X  X  X  10 , 541 beautiful+ No  X  X  X  4 , 501 beautiful+ No formula with parameters K1=1.2 and b=0.76 [14]. We measured effectiveness using P@30, as in the TREC-2011 Microblog track, and used a paired 2-tailed t-test with p-value less than 0.05 to ascertain statistical significance. 
Table 3 reports the results for all the runs on the full collection along with indication of which runs were statistica lly significantly better than others. The results suggest the following: -Performing extended normalization led to stat istically significant improvement whether we em ployed stemming or not. -Unlike previously reported Arabic retrieval results (on a collection of 383k newswire stories): Using character 4-grams did not yield any improvement; and removing stopwords adversely affected retrieval effectiveness  X  though not significantly, which we suspect is due to the effe ct of removing stopwords on the length of documents -Though stemming improved retr ieval effectiveness, the difference between NormD and StemD was not statistically significant. Previously reported results in the literature showed that stemming led to statistically significant improvements. In our analysis we observed that:  X  Stemming changed the intent of some queries. Consider the query  X   X  X  X   X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  AlmtZAhrAt fy mSr X  (the female protestors in Egypt). This query is related to incidents in which female protestors were attacked by security personnel, causing public uproar. When stemming was applied to the word for  X  X he female protestors X  (AlmtZAhrA t), the determiner and the feminine plural marker were removed leading to the singular masculine word for  X  X rotestor  X . Stemming led to 90 basis points drop in P@30. In other que ries, removing the feminine plural or singular markers was beneficial, as in:  X   X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X   X  A$tbAkAt fy mSr X  (confrontations in Egypt), where the word for  X  X onfrontations X  (A$tbAkAt) in Arabic is a feminine plural and is stemmed to the singular masculine form for  X  X onfrontation X , and  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X  AlHrkp 
AlmEArDp fy AlbHryn X  (opposition movement in Bahrain), where the word for opposition (AlmEArDp) is feminine singular and is stemmed to the singular masculine word for  X  X n opposing person X .  X  Due to the large number of tw eets and the limited number of retrieved tweets (only 30), most morphological forms are found often. Consider the Arabic words  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (wAlvwrp) X  (and the revolution),  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  (Alvwrp) X  (the revolution), and  X   X  X  X  X  (vwrp) X  (revolution), which appear in 15,593, 731,859, and 221,410 tweets respectively. In this typical example, though some morphological forms are more common than others, the least frequent form still appeared thousands of times. 
Based on the results, we can glean that: 
In this paper we focused on retr ieval of Arabic microblogs. We presented issues that complicate retrieval and ways we can overcome some of these issues. We introduced new extended word normalization that include s improved letter normalization and elongated and shortened word handling. We also constructed a new stopword list that covers MS A as well as dialectic Arabic. Our experiments show that our extended normalization significantly improved upon state-of -the-art normalization, and using extended normalization can lead to results that are comparable to using stemmi ng. Combining stemming with extended normalization leads to further improvement. We found that stopword removal often may l ead to degradation in retrieval effectiveness, but the differences were not statistically significant. 
For future work, stemming a nd stopword removal require further investigation for Arab ic microblog retrieval tasks. Run P@30 Significantly better than Norm 0.596 -NormD 0.644 Norm NormDS 0.624 -Stem 0.673 Norm StemD 0.694 Norm, Stem StemDS 0.676 Norm
