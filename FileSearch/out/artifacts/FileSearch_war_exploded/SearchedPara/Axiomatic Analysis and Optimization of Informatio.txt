 Axiomatic approach provides a systematic way to think about heuristics, identify the weakness of existing methods, and optimize the existing methods accordingly. This tutorial aims to promote axiomatic thinking that can benefit not only the study of IR models but also the methods for many IR applications.

One of the most important research problems in Informa-tion Retrieval (IR) is to develop optimal general IR models. Since IR models determine how to compute the relevance score of a document for a given query, they directly affect the accuracy of a search engine. An improved retrieval model is expected to enable every search engine to achieve higher search accuracy. Thus, it has been a long-standing challenge to develop a general effective retrieval model.

Over the past decades, significant amount of research has focused on developing and studying various retrieval mod-els. These efforts have led to a few state of the art retrieval functions including Pivoted normalization function from the vector space model, Okapi BM25 from the classical proba-bilistic model, Dirichlet prior smoothing from the language modeling approach and PL2 from the divergence from ran-domness model. However, it has been shown to be difficult to further improve these state of the art retrieval functions.
Recently, there has been a promising breakthrough in IR model research where a novel axiomatic framework is used to model the relevance, diagnose deficiencies of existing IR models and improve them. In particular, the basic idea is to model the relevance more directly with formally defined
