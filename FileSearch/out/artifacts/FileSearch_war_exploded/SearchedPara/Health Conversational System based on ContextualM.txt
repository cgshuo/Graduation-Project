 More and more people are turning to the World Wide Web for learning and sharing information about their health us-ing search engines, forums and question answering systems. In this demonstration, we look at a new way of deliver-ing health information to the end-users via coherent con-versations. The proposed conversational system allows the end-users to vaguely express and gradually refine their in-formation needs using only natural language questions or statements as input. We provide example scenarios in this demonstration to illustrate the inadequacies of current de-livery mechanisms and highlight the innovative aspects of the proposed conversational system.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval X  search process ; H.5.2 [ Information Interfaces and Presentation ]: User Interfaces X  natural language Algorithms, Human Factors QA Pairs, Conversational Agent, Health Information
The World Wide Web has revolutionised the ways we ac-cess information, and health-related information is no excep-tion [5]. The sense of empowerment derived from the any-time, anywhere access of online information coupled with the rising cost of healthcare have contributed to our in-creasing reliance on the Web for purposes ranging from self-diagnosis to sharing patient experiences. Although the use of online information for health-related purposes has been greatly criticised by health practitioners [8, 7], benefits have express and gradually build up over time their health infor-mation needs. The innovative aspects of this system, which set it apart from existing conversational agents, are: The demonstrated system provides far more concise responses than document retrieval systems, and while it may not de-liver the precise answers available from a specialised ques-tion answering system, it is able to carry on a meaningful and natural interaction in response to both questions and statements. The coherence of the content is far greater than standard chatterbots such as ALICE 2 .

We allow the QA pairs retrieved to be manually edited to improve their quality, though certain aspects such as spelling correction can be automated to some extent. In our demonstration system, the QA pairs are unedited in our DB, though in the examples shown only the initial sentences are used for readability. Although this demonstration focuses on health-related conversations, the system is generic and can be extended to converse about other topics by downloading the corresponding QA pairs.
To illustrate the use and features of the demonstration sys-tem and its differences from existing delivery mechanisms, let us consider the following scenario. A user accidentally cuts her finger whilst cooking and has no knowledge of basic first aid. If she is one of the two billion Internet users world-wide today 3 , she may first go to the Web for information. Her first stop would be to use one of the many popular Web search engines today such as Google, Yahoo! or Bing. Using Google in this scenario to search for  X  X  X  X e accidentally cut myself. What do I do? X  , close to 400 million results were returned with Figure 2 showing the top 3. The results are clearly not the concise response desired in such a situation. A user may then try alternative keywords to find more suit-able results. Even then, the results obtained are generally not concise as the end-user has to click on each of the indi-vidual links and filter through the webpages looking for the appropriate answer.

The above is typical for search engines as they are sim-ply document retrieval systems. Let us instead consider us-ing the two question answering systems HONqa 4 ,thatspe-cialises in health information, and the more generic START 5 . Entering the same natural language question  X  X  accidentally cut myself. What do I do? X  , we find, as shown in Figures
There is work using QA pairs for automated question an-swering [2, 9], but our focus is on coherent conversations. http://alice.pandorabots.com/ http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/press_ releases/2010/39.aspx http://www.hon.ch/QA http://start.csail.mit.edu Figure 2: The answers provided by (a) START, (b) HONqa and (c) ALICE in response to the input  X  X  accidentally cut myself. What do I do? X  . ous user inputs. After learning from the system that alcohol or peroxide should not be used on her wounds, she moved on to ask  X  X hat antiseptic works best then? X  . The proposed system answered with  X  X ood old soap and water! X  ,whichis a valid response despite being somewhat cheeky. The user persists on obtaining more information by asking  X  X eriously, my wound is quite large X  . Not knowing what  X  X etadine X  is from the system X  X  response, she further inquires  X  X hat is betadine? X  , to which a reasonable answer was provided.
The responses produced by the proposed system in the above scenario are all answers from Yahoo!Answers X  QA pairs that were truncated for presentation. The response  X  X ood old soap and water! X  , for instance, is the answer to the question  X  X hat works best to clean cuts alcohol,hydrogen peroxide, hand sanitizer ect? X  , which together form a QA pair from Yahoo!Answers 6 . As for the system response  X  X ust wash the area with Betadine... X  to the user input  X  X eriously, my wound is quite large X  , it is the answer to the question  X  X hat works better for large cuts... What else is good to use? X  7 . These two and in fact, all other QA pairs from Ya-hoo!Answers are distinct answers to individual questions. This is why we refer to the QA pairs as disjointed. By themselves, they are unable to contribute much to forming coherent conversations. However, with the scoring process based on exponential decay and contextual information to be briefly described in the next Section 3, the proposed system is able to engage users in coherent and relevant conversations about their health concerns. http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid= 20080722161422AAxIRpe http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid= 20060726190740AAXdL1L using the API 8 provided by Yahoo!. The use of QA pairs is ideal considering the fact that data from Q&amp;A websites are not optimal for factoid input but instead, are a preferred choice for complex information needs such as opinion or ad-vice [4]. We are also motivated by the availability of APIs to ease the implementation process. QA pairs may also be obtained from other community-driven Q&amp;A websites such as Answers.com . Many of these websites, however, do not permit the non-commercial, automated extraction of data from their sites, hence preventing their use here.
A GUI has been created to allow the system administrator to manage the various aspects of gathering QA pairs from Yahoo!Answers. Using this interface, the administrator is able to provide keywords for extraction, examine the current composition of the QA pairs, and search and edit the QA pairs currently in the database. Other metadata such as category and the date of posting, which are not used in this version of the system, can also be extracted and used during the scoring process to improve the quality of the responses.
Next, we look at the process of using inputs in a con-versation to create gradually-decaying context for retrieving and scoring QA pairs in our database with the aim of lo-cating the best responses. Every input is first analysed for keywords. In this version of the system, we consider a key-word as a word or phrase that is content-bearing, that is, not a function word. The words in an input are first chun-ked using parts of speech and later filtered using a stopword list 9 . At each turn in a conversation where the user provides an input, the keywords from previous user utterances (i.e., context) and the current keywords are unioned and weighted using a decay model. Intuitively, a keyword that no longer appears in the more recent inputs will have its weight de-cayed. If a keyword is constantly repeated up till the most recent input, its weight will be more.

A simple structured query to the database is then per-formed to obtain all QA pairs containing at least one key-word from the unioned and weighted set of keywords at the current turn. Each pair is assigned a score using four crite-ria based on the frequency and location of the occurrences of keywords as well as other heuristics involving edit distance and so on. The details of these criteria and the scoring pro-cess in general are outlined in [11] 10 .
In this demonstration, we will show the system interfaces for conversing about health issues with the end-users, and for populating the database with QA pairs to cope with evolving conversations. In particular, we will demonstrate how an end-user can easily interact with the proposed con-versational system over a range of health issues. During the demonstration, we will restrict conversations with the sys-tem to 10 health and medical-related concepts (e.g.,  X  X ung cancer X  ,  X  X inusitis X  ,  X  X ry mouth X  ) from the list of 150 used for evaluating health-specific question answering systems [6]. This restriction will allow us to examine the capabilities and limitations of the system together with the audience within a controlled space, showing the effect of the depth and breadth http://developer.yahoo.com/answers
In later versions, we will examine the need for more ad-vanced noun phrase chunking and term extraction.
