 Wikipedia X  X  rich category structure has helped make it one of the largest semantic taxonomies in existence, a property that has been central to much recent research. However, Wikipedia X  X  category representation is simplistic: an article contains a single list of categories, with no data about their relative importance. We investigate the ordering of cate-gory lists to determine how a category X  X  position in the list correlates with its relevance to the article and overall sig-nificance. We identify a number of interesting connections between a category X  X  position and its persistence within the article, age, popularity, size, and descriptiveness. H.4.0 [ Information Systems Applications ]: General Experimentation, Measurement A typical Wikipedia article contains a list of categories (e.g.,  X 21st century actors X ), which serve to place the article within the semantic, conceptual structure of Wikipedia. Categories, in turn, are implemented as special Wikipedia pages, which list all of the pages for which the category label is assigned. There is a many-to-many relationship between articles and categories, and they are intended as a way for users to nav-igate among articles (e.g., by selecting a category through which to find related articles). As with normal Wikipedia content, categories are added or removed to a page by edits from the community of Wikipedia authors (i.e., the general public). Hence, they reflect a form of editorial consensus; an aggregate human view of how an article fits within the conceptual space.
 In this work, we examine the role played by the order of Table 1: Operations. As some operations can coin-cide with others, the portion sum is &gt; 1 . an article, and (2) the age of the category (as defined by time since the category was created). Conceptually, the longer a category exists within an article, the more scrutiny it per-sists, and the older a category article, the more established it is within Wikipedia X  X  category structure.

For each article in Wikitop , we examined its current list of categories (i.e., the list appearing in the most recent ver-sion), and measured the duration over which each category in this list was present in the article. For each category po-sition from 0-14 (with 0 being leftmost), we recorded the mean duration for categories at that position across all ar-ticles in Wikitop , depicted in Figure 1 1 . In other words, the value at position 0 reflects the mean duration of categories appearing at position 0 across all articles in Wikitop . A cat-egory at position 0 appears, on average, within its article for about 73% of the article X  X  lifetime. As position increases, we observe a large decline in the duration for which categories at that position are present in the article. Figure 2 depicts the mean age of categories over position. As in Figure 1 we see a decline as position increases. This indicates that older and more persistent categories are placed in lower positions. We report the connection between position and cate-gory popularity and size. Popularity is defined by num-ber of times web surfers accessed the category article directly (e.g., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category: 1975_births ) over a given time period 2 . The size of a cat-egory is defined by the number of articles it contains. Figure 3 depicts the popularity of articles across position. We observe an overall general though variable decline of pop-ularity with position 3 .

Figure 4 depicts the mean size of categories across posi-tion. We observe a sharp decline among the first few posi-tions. This could indicate that categories placed in leftmost positions are more applicable overall (as they have more ar-ticles) or are generally more favored by Wikipedia authors. In this section we examine the relationship between posi-tion and category descriptiveness, which indicates how well a category describes a particular article. We examine this property in three ways.
Around 85% of articles have 15 or fewer categories, so we chose this as the number of category positions to consider.
We aggregated access data from the repository, obtained from three one hour periods [1]. In Figure 3 and Figure 4, we omit data pertaining to the Living people category, an exceptionally large outlier.
Figure 3: Category popularity across position. category importance, a category with a lower mean position across all of its articles is likely to be more significant over-all. Figure 6 depicts the mean leftness of categories across position, revealing that the mean leftness of a category in-creases with position. In other words, categories that tend to appear at a higher position in Wikitop also tend to ap-pear in higher positions in all of the articles they contain, indicating that they are generally subordinate categories. The next score we consider is categorical similarity. We consider a category to be a more specific descriptor if the articles with which it is associated tend to be more similar to each other. We measure this via the mean similarity of a category X  X  articles among each other, with similarity calculated by the Jaccard coefficient: In other words, it is the proportion of category overlap among categories in a pair. For each category, we calculated the position of a category X  X  parents within the articles they con-tain. This echoes the trend in Figure 6, indicating parent categories can also be distinguished by relative importance. We are uncertain about the implications of Figure 8; our intuition is that categories with many parent categories are likely to be more specific while also less independently use-ful. Nonetheless, the exceptional value for the 0th position in both cases should be noted. This work represents a preliminary analysis of some Wikipedia category attributes, specifically with respect to their posi-tion in category lists. We identified a number of connec-tions to position; at lower positions, categories tend to be (1) those which persisted for longer durations in the article, (2) older, (3) more popular, and (4) larger. Our analysis of descriptiveness also indicates that categories at lower posi-tions (5) contain articles with fewer categories, hence their categories are more exclusive; (6) generally appear at lower positions across all the articles they contain; and (7) con-tain articles that are more similar to each other in terms of category overlap. With respect to (1), (2), (4), and (5), the drop off after position 0 is dramatic, indicating that there is increased importance on the first few listed categories, es-pecially at the leftmost position. Though our work is at an early stage, we believe these results provide support that Wikipedia X  X  guidelines are generally followed, and we advo-cate the emphasis of leftmost categories among researchers who make use of Wikipedia categories.

We plan to continue this work. First, we intend to exe-cute a user evaluation in which category quality  X  especially with respect to article assignments  X  is assessed by human raters. Next, we seek to continue the analysis on (1) less popular and (2) lower quality articles (as indicated by im-provement flags placed by editors) to find if the observations hold. Finally, we desire to apply our discoveries in a set of ranking functions, which can help determine the best cat-egory for an article based on a preference metric, such as quality, comprehensiveness, exclusivity, or descriptiveness.
