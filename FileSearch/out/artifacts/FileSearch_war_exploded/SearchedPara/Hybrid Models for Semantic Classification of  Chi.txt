 Research on semantic annotation has focused primarily on word sense disambiguation (WSD), i.e., the task of determining the appropriate sense for each instance of a polysemous word out of a set of senses defined for the word in some lexi-con. Much less work has been done on semantic classification of unknown words, i.e., words that are not listed in the lexicon. However, real texts typically contain a large number of unknown words. Successful classification of unknown words is not only useful for lexical acquisition, but also necessary for natural language process-ing (NLP) tasks that require semantic annotation. This paper addresses the problem of classify-ing Chinese unknown words into fine-grained semantic categories defined in a Chinese thesau-rus, Cilin (Mei et al., 1984). This thesaurus clas-sifies over 70,000 words into 12 major catego-ries, including human (A), concrete object (B), time and space (C), abstract object (D), attributes (E), actions (F), mental activities (G), activities (H), physical states (I), relations (J), auxiliaries (K), and honorifics (L). The 12 major categories are further divided into 94 medium categories, which in turn are subdivided into 1428 small categories. Each small category contains syno-nyms that are close in meaning. For example, under the major category D , the medium cate-gory Dm groups all words that refer to institu-tions, and the small category Dm05 groups all words that refer to educational institutions, e.g.,  X  X  X  xu X xi X o  X  X chool X . Unknown word classifi-cation involves a much larger search space than WSD. In classifying words into small categories in Cilin , the search space for a polysemous known word consists of all the categories the word belongs to, but that for an unknown word consists of all the 1428 small categories. 
Research on WSD has concentrated on using contextual information, which may be limited for infrequent unknown words. On the other hand, Chinese characters carry semantic infor-mation that is useful for predicting the semantic properties of the words containing them. We pre-sent three novel knowledge-based models that capture the relationship between the semantic categories of an unknown word and those of its component characters in three different ways, and combine two of them with a corpus-based model that uses contextual information to clas-sify unknown words. Experiments show that the combined knowledge-based model achieves an accuracy of 61.6% for classifying unknown words into small categories in Cilin , but the use of contextual information does not further im-prove performance. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the three novel knowledge-based models proposed for this task. Section 3 describes a corpus-based model. Section 4 re-ports the experiment results of the proposed models. Section 5 compares these results with previous results. Section 6 concludes the paper and points to avenues for further research. This section describes three novel knowledge-based models for semantic classification of Chi-nese unknown words, including an overlapping-character model, a character-category association model, and a rule-based model. These models model the relationship between the semantic category of an unknown word and those of its component characters in three different ways. 2.1 The Baseline Model The baseline model predicts the category of an unknown word by counting the number of over-lapping characters between the unknown word and the member words in each category. As words in the same category are similar in mean-ing and the meaning of a Chinese word is gener-ally the composition of th e meanings of its char-acters, it is common for words in the same cate-gory to share one or more character. This model tests the hypothesis that speakers draw upon the repertoire of characters that relate to a concept when creating new words to realize it. 
For each semantic category in Cilin , the set of unique characters in its member words are ex-tracted, and the number of times each character occurs in word-initial, word-middle, and word-final positions is recorded. With this informa-tion, we develop two va riants of the baseline model, which differ from each other in terms of whether it takes into consideration the positions in which the characters occur in words. 
In variant 1, the score of a category is the sum of the number of occurrences of each character of the target word in the category, as in (1), where t j denotes a category, w denotes the target length of w , and f(c i ) is the frequency of c i in t (1)  X 
In variant 2, the score of a category is the sum of the number of occurrences of each character of the unknown word in the category in its corre-sponding position, as in (2), where p i denotes the position of c i in w , which could be word-initial, word-middle, or word-final, and f(c i ,p i ) denotes the frequency of c i in position p i in t j . 
In each variant, the category with the maxi-mum score for a target word is proposed as the category of the word. 2.2 Character-Category Associations The relationship between the semantic category of an unknown word and those of its component characters can also be captured in a more sophis-ticated way using informat ion-theoretical models. We use two statistical measures, mutual infor-mation and  X  2 , to compute character-category associations and word-category associations. Chen (2004) used the  X  2 measure to compute character-character and word-word associations, but not word-category associations. We use word-category associations to directly predict the semantic categories of unknown words. 
The mutual information and  X  2 measures are calculated as in (3) and (4), where Asso(c,t j ) de-notes the association between a character c and a the probability and frequency of X respectively. (3) (4) (5) Once the character-category associations are calculated, the association between a word w and a category t j , Asso ( w , t j ), can be calculated as the sum of the weighted associations between each of the word X  X  characters and the category, as in denotes the length of w , and  X  i denotes the weight are determined empirically based on the posi-tions of the characters in the word. 
As in variant 2 of the baseline model, the character-category association model can also be made sensitive to the positions in which the characters occur in the words. To this end, we first need to compute the position-sensitive asso-ciations between a category and a character in the word-initial, word-middle, and word-final positions separately. The position-sensitive asso-ciation between an unknown word and a cate-gory can then be computed as the sum of the weighted position-sensitiv e associations between each of its characters and the category. 
Once the word-category associations are com-puted, we can propose the highest ranked cate-gory or a ranked list of categories for each un-known word. 2.3 A Rule-Based Model The third knowledge-based model uses linguistic rules to classify unknown words based on the syntactic and semantic categories of their com-ponent characters. Rule-based models have not been used for this task before. However, there are some regularities in the relationship between the semantic categories of unknown words and those of their component characters that can be captured in a more direct and effective way by linguistic rules than by statistical models. 
A separate set of rules are developed for words of different lengths. Rules are initially developed based on knowledge about Chinese word formation, and are then refined by examin-ing the development data. In general, the com-plete rule set takes a few hours to develop. The rule in (7) is developed for bisyllabic un-known words. This rule proposes the common category of a bisyllabic word X  X  two characters as its category. It is especially useful for words with a parallel structure, i.e., words whose two characters have the same meaning and syntactic category, e.g.,  X  X  t  X  nt  X   X  X ollapse X , where  X  t  X  n and  X  t  X  both mean  X  X ollapse X  and share the category Id05 . The thresholds for f A and f B are determined empirically and are both set to 1 if AB is a noun and to 0 and 3 respectively other-wise. 
A number of rules are developed for trisyl-labic words. While most rules in the model are general, the first rule in th is set is rather specific, as it handles words with three specific prefixes,  X  d X   X  X ig X ,  X  xi  X  o  X  X ittle X , and  X  l  X  o  X  X ld X , which usually do not change the category of the root word. The other four rules again utilize the categories of the unknown word X  X  component characters. The rules in (8b) and (8c) are similar to the rule in (7). The ones in (8d) and (8e) search for neighbor words with a similar struc-ture as the target word. Eligible neighbors have a common morpheme with the target word in the same position and a second morpheme that shares a category with the second morpheme of the target word. For example, an eligible neighbor for  X  X  X  X  tu  X  xi  X  o-sh  X  ng  X  X ales-man X  is  X  X  X  xi  X  osh X u-sh  X  ng  X  X istribut-or X . These two words share the morpheme  X  sh  X  ng  X  X usi-nessman X  in the word-final position, and the morphemes  X  X  X  tu  X  xi  X  o  X  X o market X  and  X  X  xi  X  osh X u  X  X istribute X  share the category He03 . The rule in (8d) therefore applies in this case. (8) For a trisyllabic word ABC : 
The rules for four-character words are given in (9). Like the rules in (8d) and (8e), these rules also search for neighbors of the target word. The knowledge-based models described above classify unknown words using information about the syntactic and semantic categories of their component characters. Another useful source of information is the context in which unknown words occur. While contextual information is the primary source of information used in WSD re-search and has been used for acquiring semantic lexicons and classifying unknown words in other languages (e.g., Roark and Charniak 1998; Ci-aramita 2003; Curran 2005), it has been used in only one previous study on semantic classifica-tion of Chinese unknown words (Chen and Lin, 2000). Part of the goal of this study is to investi-gate whether and how these two different sources of information can be combined to im-prove performance on sema ntic classification of Chinese unknown words. 
To this end, we first use the knowledge-based models to propose a list of five candidate catego-ries for the target word, then extract a general-ized context for each category in Cilin from a corpus, and finally compute the similarity be-tween the context of the target word and the gen-eralized context of each of its candidate catego-ries. Comparing the context of the target word with generalized contexts of categories instead of contexts of individual words alleviates the data-sparseness problem, as infrequent words have limited contextual information. Limiting the search space for each target word to the top five candidate categories reduces the computa-tional cost that comes with the full search space. 3.1 Context Extraction and Representation A generalized context for each semantic cate-gory is built from the contexts of its member words. This is done based on the assumption that as the words in the same category have the same or similar meaning, they tend to occur in similar contexts. In terms of context extraction and rep-resentation, we need to consider four factors. Member Words The issue here is whether to include the contexts of polysemous member words in building the generalized context of a category. Including these contexts without dis-crimination introduces noise. To measure the effect of such noise, we build two versions of generalized context for each category, one using contexts of unambiguous member words only, and the other using contexts of all member words. Context Words There are two issues in select-ing words for context representation. First, words that contribute little information to the discrimination of meaning of other words, in-cluding conjunctions, numerals, auxiliaries, and non-Chinese sequences, are excluded. Second, to model the effect of frequency on the context words X  contribution to meaning discrimination, we use two sets of context words: one consists of the 1000 most frequent words in the corpus; the other consists of all words in the corpus. Window Size For WSD, both topical context and microcontext have been used (Ide and V X ronis 1998). Topical context includes substan-tive words that co-occur with the target word within a larger window, whereas microcontext includes words in a small window around the target word. We experiment with topical context and microcontext with window sizes of 100 and 6 respectively (i.e., 50 and 3 words to the left and right of the target word respectively). Context Representation We represent the con-text of a category as a vector &lt; w 1 , w 2 , ..., w where n is the total number of context words, and w i is the weight of the i th context word. To arrive at this representa tion, we first record the number of times each context word occurs within a specified window of each member word of a category in the corpus as a vector &lt; f 1 , f 2 , ..., f &gt;, where f i is the number of times the i th con-text word co-occurs with a member word of the category. We then compute the weight of a con-text word w in context c , W ( w , c ), using mutual information and t -test, which were reported by Weeds and Weir (2005) to perform the best on a pseudo-disambiguation task. These weight func-tions are computed as in (10) and (11), where N denotes the size of the corpus. (10) (11) 3.2 Contextual Similarity Measurement We compute the similarity between the context vectors of the unknown word and its candidate categories using cosine. The cosine of two n -dimensional vectors x r and y r , cos ( x r , y r ), is com-puted as in (12), where x i and y i denote the weight of the i th context word in x r and y r . (12) 4.1 Experiment Setup The models are developed and tested using the Contemporary Chinese Corpus from Peking University (Yu et al. 2002) and the extended Cilin released by the Information Retrieval Lab at Harbin Institute of Technology. The corpus contains all the articles published in January, 1999 in People X  X  Daily , a major newspaper in China. It contains over 1.12 million tokens and is word-segmented and POS-tagged. Table 1 sum-marizes the distribution of words in Cilin . Of the 76,029 words in Cilin , 35,151 are found in the Contemporary Chinese Corpus. 
We classify words into the third-level catego-ries in the extended Cilin , which are equivalent to the small categories in the original Cilin . The development and test sets consist of 3,000 words each, which are randomly selected from the sub-set of words in Cilin that are two to four charac-ters long, that have occurred in the Contempo-rary Chinese Corpus, and that are tagged as nouns, verbs, or adjectives in the corpus. The words in the development and test sets are also controlled for frequency, with 1/3 of them occur-ring 1-3 times, 3-6 times, and 7 or more times in the corpus respectively. 
As Chen (2004) noted, excluding all the words in the development and test data in the testing stage worsens the data-sparseness prob-lem for knowledge-based models, as some cate-gories have few member words, and some char-acters appear in few words in some categories. To alleviate this problem, the remove-one method is used for testing the knowledge-based models. In other words, the models are re-trained for each test word using information about all the words in Cilin except the test word. The cor-pus-based model is trained once using the train-ing data only, as the data-sparseness problem is alleviated by using generalized contexts of cate-gories. Finally, if a word is polysemous, it is considered to have been correctly classified if the proposed category is one of its categories. 4.2 Results of the Baseline Model Tables 2 and 3 summarize the results of the baseline model in terms of the accuracy of its best guess and best five guesses respectively. 
The columns labeled  X  X  on-filtered X  report re-sults where all categories are considered for each unknown word, and the ones labeled  X  X OS-filtered X  report results where only the categories that agree with the POS category of the unknown word are considered. In the latter case, if the tar-get word is a noun, only the small categories un-der major categories A-D are considered; other-wise, only those under major categories E-L are considered. The results show that using POS in-formation about the unknown word to filter cate-gories improves performance. Variant 2 per-forms better when only the best guess is consid-ered, indicating that it is useful to model the ef-fect of position on a character X  X  contribution to word meaning in this case. However, it is not helpful to be sensitive to character position when the best five guesses are considered. 4.3 Results of the Character-Category As-In this model, only categories that agree with the POS category of the unknown word and that share at least one character with the unknown word are considered. These filtering steps sig-nificantly reduce the search space for this model. We discussed three parameters of the model in Section 2.2, including the statistical measure, the sensitivity to character position in computing character-category associations, and the weights of the associations between categories and char-acters in different positions. In addition, the computation of the character-category associa-tions can be sensitive or insensitive to the POS categories of the words containing the characters. In the POS-sensitive way, associations are com-puted among nouns (words in categories A-D) and non-nouns (words in categories E-L) sepa-rately, whereas in the POS-insensitive way, they are computed using all the words. 
Tables 4 and 5 summarize the results of the character-category association model in terms of the accuracy of its best guess and best five guesses respectively. In all cases, the weights assigned to word-initial, word-middle, and word-final characters are 0.49, 0, and 0.51 respectively. 
In terms of the best guess, the model achieves a best accuracy of 58.2%, a 6.5% improvement over the baseline result. The results show that  X  2 consistently performs better than mutual infor-mation, and computing position-sensitive char-acter-category associations consistently im-proves performance. However, computing POS-sensitive associations gives mixed results. 
In terms of the best five guesses, the model achieves a best accuracy of 83.8% on the test data, a 2.1% improvement over the best baseline result. Using  X  2 again achieves better results. However, in this case, the best results are achieved when the character-category associa-tions are insensitive to both character position and the POS categories of words. 4.4 Results of the Rule-Based Model 
Table 6 summarizes the results of the rule-based model in terms of recall, precision and F-score. The model returns multiple categories for some words, and it is considered to have cor-rectly classified a word only when it returns a single, correct category for the word. Precision of the model is computed over all the cases where the model returns a single guess, and re-call is computed over all cases. The model achieves an overall precision of 80.3% on the test data, much higher than the accuracy of the other two knowledge-based models. However, recall of the model is only 21.6%. The compara-ble results on the development and test sets indi-cate that the encoded rules are general. The model generally performs better on longer words than on shorter words. 4.5 Combining the Character-Category Given that the rule-based model achieves a higher precision but a lower recall than the char-acter-category association model, the two mod-els can be combined to improve the overall per-formance. In general, if the rule-based model returns one or more categories, these categories are first ranked among themselves by their asso-ciations with the unknown word. They are then followed by the other categories returned by the character-category association model. Tables 7 and 8 summarize the results of combining the two models. 
In terms of the best guess, the combined model achieves an accuracy of 61.6%, a 3.4% improvement over the best result of the charac-ter-category association model alone. This is achieved using  X  2 with POS-sensitive and posi-tion-sensitive computation of character-category associations. In terms of the best five guesses, the model achieves an accuracy of 85.6%, a 1.8% improvement over the best result of the character-category association model alone. 
To facilitate comparison with previous studies, the results of the combined model in terms of its best guess in classifying unknown words into major and medium categories are summarized in Table 9. As  X  2 consistently outperforms mutual information, results are reported for  X  2 only. With POS-sensitive and position-sensitive com-putation of character-category associations, the combined model achieves an accuracy of 83.0% and 69.9% for classifying unknown words into major and medium categories respectively. 4.6 Results of the Corpus-Based Model The corpus-based model re-ranks the five high-est ranked categories proposed by the combined knowledge-based model. Table 10 enumerates the parameters of the model and lists the labels used to denote the various settings in Table 11. 
Table 11 summarizes the results of 16 runs of the model with differen t parameter settings. The best accuracy on the test data is 37.1%, achieved in run 5 with the following parameter settings: using unambiguous member words for building contexts of categories, using all words in the corpus for context representation, using a win-dow size of 100, and using mutual information as the weight function. As the combined knowl-edge-based model gives an accuracy of 85.6% for its best five guesses, the expected accuracy of a naive model that randomly picks a candidate for each word as its best guess is 17.1%. Com-pared with this baseline, the corpus-based model achieves a 13.0% improvement, but it performs much worse than the knowledge-based models. 
Table 12 summarizes the accuracy of the top three runs of the model on words with different frequency in the corpus. Each of the three groups consists of 1,000 words that have occurred 1-2, 3-6, and 7 or more times in the corpus respec-tively. The model consistently performs better on words with higher frequency, suggesting that it may benefit from a larger corpus. The few previous studies on semantic classifica-tion of Chinese unknown word have primarily adopted knowledge-based models. Chen (2004) proposed a model that retrieves the word with the greatest association with the target word. This model is computa tionally more expensive than our character-category association model, as it entails computing associations between every character-category, category-character, character-character, and word-word pair. He re-ported an accuracy of 61.6% on bisyllabic V-V compounds. However, he included all the test words in training the model. If we also include the test words in computing character-category associations, the computationally cheaper model achieves an overall accuracy of 75.6%, with an accuracy of 75.1% on verbs. 
Chen and Chen (2000) adopted similar exem-plar-based models. Chen and Chen used a mor-phological analyzer to identify the head of the target word and the semantic categories of its modifier. They then retr ieved examples with the same head as the target word. Finally, they com-puted the similarity between two words as the similarity between thei r modifiers, using the concept of information load (IC) of the least common ancestor (LCA) of the modifiers X  se-mantic categories. They reported an accuracy of 81% for classifying 200 unknown nouns. Given the small test set of their study, it is hard to di-rectly compare their results with ours. 
Tseng used a morphological analyzer in the same way, but she also derived the morpho-syntactic relationship between the morphemes. She retrieved examples that share a morpheme with the target word in the same position and filtered those with a different morpho-syntactic relationship. Finally, she computed the similarity between two words as the similarity between their non-shared morphemes, using a similar concept of IC of the LCA of two categories. She classified unknown words into the 12 major categories only, and reported accuracies 65.8% on adjectives, 71.4% on nouns, and 52.8% on verbs. These results are not as good as the 83.0% overall accuracy our combined knowledge-based model achieved for classifying unknown words into major categories. 
Chen and Lin (2000) is the only study that used contextual information for the same task. To generate candidate categories for a word, they looked up its translations in a Chinese-English dictionary and the synsets of the transla-tions in WordNet, and mapped the synsets to the categories in Cilin . They used a corpus-based model similar to ours to rank the candidates. They reported an accuracy of 34.4%, which is close to the 37.1% accuracy of our corpus-based model, but lower than the 61.6% accuracy of our combined knowledge-based model. In addition, they could only classify the unknown words listed in the Chinese-English dictionary. 
We presented three knowledge-based models and a corpus-based model for classifying Chi-nese unknown words into fine-grained categories in the Chinese thesaurus Cilin , a task important for lexical acquisition and NLP applications that require semantic annotation. The knowledge-based models use information about the catego-ries of the unknown words X  component charac-ters, while the corpus-bas ed model uses contex-tual information. By combining the character-category association and rule-based models, we achieved an accuracy of 61.6%. The corpus-based model did not improve performance. 
Several avenues can be taken for further re-search. First, additional resources, such as bilin-gual dictionaries, morphological analyzers, par-allel corpora, and larger corpora with richer lin-guistic annotation may prove useful for improv-ing both the knowledge-based and corpus-based models. Second, we only explored one way to combine the knowledge-based and corpus-based models. Future work may explore alternative ways to combine these models to make better use of contextual information.
