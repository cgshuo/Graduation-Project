 Social media provides a new and potentially rich source of information for emergency management services. However, extracting the relevant information from such streams poses a number of difficult challenges. In this short paper, we sur-vey emergency management professionals to ascertain how social media is used when responding to incidents, the search strategies that they undertake, and the challenges that they face when using social media streams. This research in-dicates that emergency management professionals employ two main strategies when searching social media streams: keyword-centric and account-centric search strategies. Fur-thermore, current search interfaces are inadequate regarding the requirements of command and control environments in the emergency management domain, where the process of information seeking is collaborative in nature and needs to support multiple information seekers.

I X  X  stuck, help please! #trapped  X  More often than not, when an emergency or disaster strikes victims and onlookers use social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flickr to communicate with friends, family and others [9, 8, 11]. However, unlike the opening message which makes a specific request for help in a particular location, most communications about an incident are not as specific, nor as informative when it comes to using this information to support and aid emergency responders. During the early stages of an incident, emergency responders are often faced with more questions than answers. Informa-tion like this may be invaluable in saving someone X  X  life, but it may also be a hoax. Consequently, teams of experts from various domains have to collate and filter information about the event, e.g. location, severity, and magnitude, from many different sources (traditional, i.e. phone calls from citizens, incoming CB radio communications from police officers, etc as well as new sources coming from social media platforms). The response team must cooperate to make sense of the sit-uation, by considering context, as well as their experiences and skills. Any errors made during this process may lead to an inappropriate response to the incident; putting lives and property at risk.

It has been argued by Palen, Vieweg and others [9, 8] that social media platforms provide new and potentially valuable source of information, which if harnessed correctly could be of tremendous benefit to emergency response teams. With the real-time nature of social media platforms and an in-ternet enabled mobile phone in the hands of most citizens there is an abundance of information now flooding in when a crisis occurs. However, as alluded to already, most of this data is not useful for emergency responders, it is potentially unreliable, uncorroborated, vague, misleading, obvious and already known, or otherwise irrelevant. This means that emergency response teams need to deal with the abundance of potentially relevant and actionable information, and then sort through the information carefully to determine its qual-ity, authoritativeness, specificity, and ultimately its utility and usefulness in responding to the situation.

Emergency responders work in time-critical and safety-critical environments, thus decisions made in command and control will affect the outcome of an adverse event (i.e. where to dispatch and allocate the finite resources at hand). Dur-ing an incident, or if one is imminent, the information needs will be determined by the context of that event. Emergency management services will need to know what type of haz-ard or crisis they are faced with, what is the severity of the event, where is its occurring location, and how many people are likely to be affected. Therefore, the collation of infor-mation from various official and unofficial sources, such as social media platforms, plays a pivotal role in supporting their situation awareness [2].

To date there have been numerous works that have shown the utility of social media to help in particular situations [6, 3, 12], for example, providing flood warnings, mapping fire out breaks and so on. However, most of the time this re-search is done post-hoc, and outwith the context of emer-gency response teams. Other work has focused on the de-velopment of IR systems that follow, filter and map events in real-time such as Twitcident [1] or Crisees [7]. Such tools aim to provide emergency responders and the public with an overview of an event, however, again such tools have been developed without a deeper appreciation and under-standing of the users that will be using these tools. Also in order to develop appropriate, context-sensitive systems that support the process of gathering, filtering and analyzing the publicly available social media information streams, a better understanding of the users, their search needs and the larger context of handling an emergency response is required.
Consequently, this paper aims to provide an insight into current search behavior of emergency management profes-sionals. To this end, we undertake a survey of such profes-sionals to ascertain how they rate the importance of social media information, what problems they face when dealing with large information streams, what actors are involved in their processes, and how information from social media plat-forms can be incorporated within their current emergency management procedures.
To ascertain the needs and requirements of emergency re-sponse and management teams we devised an online sur-vey instrument to capture how social media was being used within organizations responding to such incidents. The sur-vey was designed for individuals who are involved in emer-gency management (EM). The survey contained 64 ques-tions which were divided into five sections: 1. demographic information and expertise, 2. organizational and individual use of social media, 3. information seeking behavior, 4. technology acceptance of social media platforms, and 5. open ended questions on social media platforms for
Part 1 of the survey contained standard demographic ques-tions along with questions about their current position, how long they have worked in that position/organization, which department/organization and at which location. Since pre-vious studies on cognitive aspects of information seeking processes observed substantial differences in search behav-ior between novices and experts [4, 10]. We also included questions regarding the participants level of IT expertise, their usage of social media, level of seniority and experience in their current position. In part 2, participants were asked about which social media platforms they used during a crisis, how they utilized them, and how useful each platform was. We specifically asked about: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube, MyVideo, Flickr, Instagram, Pinterest, Personal Blogs, and others.

In part 3, we asked several questions regarding their infor-mation seeking behavior. Specifically, about the difficulty, value, quantity, reliability, and verifiability of the informa-tion on social media platforms. Also, we wanted to know how easily or possible it was to share and communicate their findings within their team/organization. With recent nat-ural and man-made adverse events, such as Virginia Tech Shooting (2007) or the Japan Earthquake (2012), highlight-ing the role of social media platforms as a way to mediate global, real-time communication, allowing the public to cre-ate and comment on such content, we were particularly in-terested in how this surge in information affected emergency response teams. For example, reports in the aftermath of the Haiti Earthquake (2010) and the public disorder events in England (2011) made it clear that the volume of user-generated content (UGC) created on social media platforms could support emergency response agencies to increase situ-ation awareness. However, it also has the potential to over-load decision makers with too much information [5]. So we included a number of questions asking participants whether they felt overloaded by the abundance of information, and how they perceived the quality and usefulness of the user-generated content. In part 4, we examined how accepting such organizations are in using social media platforms and how user-generated content could improve their current pro-cesses.

For sections 2-5 questions were either open ended or asked participants to indicate their level of agreement on a seven-point Likert scale. When presenting our results, we have reduce the seven-point Likert scales for agreement to three categories: (i) disagree, (ii) neutral i.e. neither agree nor disagree, and (iii) agree. The survey was designed to take participants approximately 30 minutes to complete. Three follow-up interviews were then conducted with selected par-ticipants to gain further insights into their search behaviors.
The emergency management domain consists of many dif-ferent types of organizations, such as police forces, fire and rescue services (FRS), or ambulance services. In order to ob-tain a large and representative sample of participants from the EM domain, the survey was sent to (i) organizations with statutory duties as emergency responders as well as to (ii) other professional EM bodies, such as the Emergency Plan-ning Society (EPS). Overall using a number of mailing lists, the survey was distributed to approximately 350 individuals within the United Kingdom. Within three weeks we received 100 responses, of which 70 were fully completed, and the other 30 only partially completed which we excluded from this analysis. The resulting response rate was approximately 20%. Participants reported to work in positions such as media manager, public communications officer, civil contin-gency coordinator, and emergency planning officer and were linked to a variety of organizations, such as council/local au-thority (37.14%), police force (31.43%), FRS or government department (14.28%), health board (5.71%) and other (e.g. maritime and coastguard agency) (11.43%).
In presenting the results from the survey, we will focus mainly on presenting our findings from part 2 and 3 of the survey on information seeking behavior of emergency man-agement professionals.
Most participants (N=70) reported to be in their cur-rent position for more than three years (64.29%) and work-ing in their current organization for more than three years (21.43%), more than 5 years (21.43%) and more than 10 years (42.86%). It is therefore assumed that a majority of the participants is well aware of their roles and responsibili-ties in the emergency management environment. In regards to their self-assessed IT experience, participants (N=69) re-ported to be competent (46.38%), proficient (33.33%) and expert (10.14%). When asked about their level of social media experience, participants (N=69) reported to be com-petent (34.78%), proficient (28.99%) and expert (5.8%).
In order to understand the motivation to search for user-generated content during incidents, we asked participants about the perceived value of information exchanged on so-cial media platforms. When asked if there is too much valu-able information 13.23% of the participants agreed, 19.12% neither agreed nor disagreed and an overall of 67.65% dis-agreed with the statement (N=68). During a follow-up in-terview one participant said that  X  there can never be too much valuable information  X . However, when asked if there is not enough valuable information 35.82% agreed -a further 19.40% of the participants were undecided (N=68). Inter-estingly 44.78% perceived social media platforms to contain enough valuable information during an incident. These re-sults may seem contradictory but suggest that while valuable information exists within UGC finding the right information poses a significant challenge.
Before asking the professionals to detail their search strate-gies, we asked them about the difficulty they had in finding information about an incident. 11.76% of the participants perceived it to be hard or very hard to find any informa-tion at all (N=68). However, 69.11% perceived this task as easy, while 19.12% neither agreed nor disagreed about the statement. This seems at odds with the previous findings, however, this was clarified during the interviews when par-ticipants pointed out it was easy to find general and causal information about an incident, but not specific, relevant, and useful information, which could be used to inform decision-making. When asked about the ease to formulate their in-formation needs, 38.24% of the participants found it easy to express their needs, while 23.53% perceived it to be difficult (N=68). During the follow-up interviews, participants noted that they had a very clear picture of their information needs and felt confident in expressing them most of the time.
Search user interfaces for social media search provide nu-merous ways to search/query for information. Table 1 pro-vides an overview of the types of search functionality used by emergency management professionals to formulate their search queries.

Looking at the results, there seemed to be two general methods of findings information. The first one is through the formulation of a query expressing information needs, similar to standard web search interfaces. Additionally, content is followed by using social media specific syntax such as hash-tags in the micro-blogging platform Twitter. The second method appears to be acccount-centric, meaning that the search for information starts with a specific account or a list of accounts, rather than a search query.
There is also the need for additional filtering of informa-tion. A piece of user-generated content considered to be topical relevant, e.g. by matching a number of keywords, may actually be irrelevant for considering in the emergency management environment. Information can also be classi-fied as misinformation and disinformation and thus should also not be considered in the decision-making process. When asked if there is too much misleading information on social media platforms during an incident 42.65% of the partici-pants (N=68) agreed, 27.94% disagreed and 29.41% neither agreed nor disagreed. Subsequently the majority of the par-ticipants reported the assessment of importance and veracity of user-generated content to be difficult -see Table 1.
In order to understand the process of verification and rel-evance judgment better, we asked what role the user ac-count/profile of the message creator plays during the assess-ment -see Table 1. From this we conclude that the majority of emergency management professionals surveyed (74.63%, N=68) not only base their relevance judgment on factors related to topic, geography or time, which are mainly de-scribing the context of the incident, but also to the notion of trust of the information provider. The specific factors, that are usually taken into consideration during the assessment of a user profile were not surveyed and may be part of future research, as it would be important for future systems design to understand what these judgments are based on. However, when looking at search strategies 71.46% of the participants (N=68) reported to search for information by looking at al-ready known accounts. This leads to believe that previous positive or negative experiences with an account effects the trust assessment for future incidents. Other methods men-tioned to assess information in regards to relevance, trust and veracity were visualization using geographical informa-tion systems to detect accumulation of similar content in a close proximity of the incident site and cross-validation of information across multiple information sources.
The exchange of information relevant to assess the situ-ation and to facilitate informed decision-making is another key requirement for any information processing system in the emergency management domain. The ability to ex-change information with other organizations during an inci-dent was perceived to be important by 46.16% of the organi-zations (N=31). We therefore asked participants about the ease to transfer findings into other systems and the ease to exchange social media search results with colleagues inside and outside their organizations.

During incidents every organization involved in the re-sponse will only have limited information processing resources available. In order to use these resources more efficiently, tasks such as filtering, annotating or assessing information should be conducted in a collaborative manner. However, when participants (N=67) were asked if they are relying on other organizations to filter information only 28.37% agreed, whereas 37.31% were neither agreed nor disagreed and 34.33% disagreed. This is surprising given that the majority of emer-gency management professionals surveyed indicated to con-duct account-centric information filtering.
In this paper we surveyed 70 professionals working in emergency management and response environments to as-certain requirements for using social media search systems. Despite the low signal-to-noise ratio in social media streams, user-generated content was seen by professionals as a timely and potentially useful source of information that could in-form the decision-making process. However, in order to incorporate data from these information streams, profes-sionals sought information that was not only topically rel-evant, but also geographically and temporally and perhaps most importantly that it was verifiable and from a cred-ible source. Due to the complexity of this task, partici-pants reported that this assessment of user-generated con-tent in regards to relevance and veracity was very difficult. When searching for user-generated content, we found that emergency management professionals employed two main strategies: keyword-centric search and account-centric search . The former relies on the expression of information needs by formulating search queries using keywords or plat-form specific syntax, such as hashtags. Additional search operators, e.g. to filter on the basis of geo-information, though, were not routinely used. Account-centric search for user-generated content entailed finding a reliable source then following that user X  X  experience of the incident. The majority of professionals (74.63%, N=68) reported that this assessment of user-generated content regarding trust and relevance was based on the profile of the content creator. Therefore, future social media search systems will also need to provide functionality to support emergency professionals in this assessment.

Emergency management environments also bring together a number of actors from various backgrounds and organiza-tions. Thus, in order to establish a joint understanding of the situation, the information seeking and processing needs to be collaborative. This was regarded to be very impor-tant to facilitate the sharing and communication of findings within response teams. Thus, search interfaces for emer-gency management need to be collaborative. In future work, we shall explore the specific needs of collaborative infor-mation seeking and sharing in order to design and build a search system tailored to the emergency management en-vironment.
