 1. Introduction
Parametric modeling technique in form of Autoregressive (AR)
An AR model can be mathematically expressed as y  X  n  X  X  Taking the z -transform of (1) gives H  X  z  X  X  Y  X  z  X  X  X  z  X   X  b 0 which is known as the system transfer function.

AR modeling technique has received the most attention in the major reason for this includes the ease associated with the computation of its model parameters as compared to other modeling techniques ( Shiavi, 2007 ). Furthermore, AR model in object shape description and analysis.

Despite the success of AR model in various areas of applica-tions ( Chon and Cohen, 1997 ; Chon et al., 1999 ; Liang and two main drawbacks namely, the accuracy of the estimated model parameters highly depends on the methods used in determining the unknown model parameters. The use of inaccu-

In recent times, ANN has been extended to complex-number complex-autoregressive (CAR) models have been reported in Aibinu et al. (2010 , 2009) .

The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows: tion techniques is discussed in Section 2 while the newly proposed AR model coefficients determination is presented in conclusion are contained in Section 4 and 5 respectively. 2. AR model coefficients determination techniques
Modeling technique involves representation of data in an efficient and parsimonious form using minimum adjustable determination and model validation. Model selection involves choosing an appropriate parametric form for the signal to be modeled. Among the known parametric models are AR model, gressive (VAR) model, moving average (MA) model, autoregres-the use of computationally efficient algorithm to determine model parameters. In most cases and especially for AR model, the required model parameters are the model coefficients and the desired features of the signal.

In this paper, AR model has been selected since the computa-paper. AR model coefficients estimation and model validation using various signals are subsequently discussed. square approach ( Bruce, 2000 ; Shiavi, 2007 ). 2.1. Autocorrelation method
To determine AR model coefficients using autocorrelation data sequence s ( n ) has been windowed, that is y  X  n  X  X  contaminated with a wide sense stationary (WSS) noise having simplification gives r  X  l  X  X  relation r yy  X  l  X  and the AR model coefficients,  X  a 1 , a called the Yule X  X alker (YW) normal equation ( Marple, 1987 ; for a large data length and it is known to always produce a stable model. One of the most successful computationally efficient techniques for solving (4) is the Levinson X  X urbin algorithm (LDA) ( Proakis and Manolakis, 2007 ; Shiavi, 2007 ). 2.2. Covariance method
In contrast to autocorrelation method that assumes data zero outside this window, the covariance technique does not points and does not apply window to the data ( Kay, 1988 ; covariance method are more accurate than those obtained from method would produce a stable filter ( Marple, 1987 ).
Modifying the error equation within the range of the given x  X  and the covariance normal equation is expressed as a r xx  X  k , l  X  X  r xx  X  k , 0  X  ; k  X  1 ; 2 , ... , p  X  6  X  where r  X  k , l  X  X  2.3. Least squares approach
In the least squares method, the AR model coefficients are obtained by minimizing the mean square error (MSE) with namely the forward, the backward and forward-backward techniques. 1. Forward linear prediction 2. Backward linear prediction 3. Combined forward and backward linear prediction The popular Burg algorithm method is based on this technique ( Proakis and Manolakis, 2007 ). 3. Development of RVNN-based AR model coefficient determination technique
The autocorrelation technique has been shown to yield AR spectra with the least resolution among the three previously ciated with the inherent windowing in the data. Moreso, the 1975 ; Kay and Marple, 1981 ).

Dehoon et al. (1996) have also shown that Yule X  X alker Similarly, the covariance matrix solution produces AR model parameters whose resulting spectra have more false peaks and quency locations than other approaches.

All the aforementioned problems have limited the use of AR operations of biological neural systems in the human body. Furthermore, this approach mimics the iterative procedure through the learning and weights adaptation procedures. RVNN tion and/or autocovariance matrix. Hence, a new method of RVNN is hereby proposed.

Consider the AR model shown in Fig. 1 , which is driven by a according to y  X  n  X  X  order respectively.

Consider the RVNN-based AR model shown in Fig. 2 , the output y ( n ) is expressed as y  X  n  X  X  a where M is the number of neurons in the hidden layer, w l 1 function. The hidden node output W l can be expressed as
