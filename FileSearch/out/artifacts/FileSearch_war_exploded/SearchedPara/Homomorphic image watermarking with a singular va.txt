 1. Introduction
The spreading of digital multimedia nowadays has made copyright protection a necessity. Authentication and informa-tion hiding have also become important issues. To achieve these security requirements, watermarking technology can be field has led to several watermarking techniques such as the correlation-based techniques, the frequency-domain techniques, and the wavelet-domain techniques ( Shoemaker &amp; Rudko, 2002 ).  X  of an embedding algorithm and a detection algorithm. An embedded watermark must achieve some requirements such as and lossy compression. Fidelity means that the watermark must be neither noticeable to the viewer nor degrading for the algorithms. The importance of these requirements depends on the application. The watermark can be embedded in the spa-tial domain or in a transform domain ( Shoemaker &amp; Rudko, 2002 ).

The SVD mathematical algorithm provides an elegant way for extracting algebraic features from an image. The main have proposed an SVD image watermarking scheme, in which the watermark is added to the SVs of the whole image or to a apart of it ( Liu &amp; Tan, 2002 ). The watermark used in this scheme may be lost due to attacks.
The main idea of homomorphic image processing is based on modeling the image as a product of a constant illumination with as a summation using the logarithmic operation. The reflectance component can be separated using a High-Pass Filter reflectance component with low energy, while the illumination component is approximately constant with high energy. We can carry out the watermarking process in the homomorphic domain on the reflectance component. Our objective is to achieve invisibility of the watermark, robustness, fidelity and tamper resistance. Invisibility is achieved by watermark embedding in the low-energy reflectance component. Robustness, fidelity, and tamper resistance are guaranteed with the properties of the SVD algorithm.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly explains the traditional SVD image watermarking scheme. Section 3 introduces the proposed SVD watermarking method in the homomorphic domain. Section 4 introduces a block-by-block implementation of SVD watermarking in the homomorphic domain. Section 5 discusses SVD watermarking in the homomor-phic domain with encrypted watermarks. Section 6 gives the experimental results. Finally, Section 7 gives the concluding remarks. 2. SVD image watermarking
The SVD of an image is computed to obtain two orthogonal matrices U and V , and a diagonal matrix S . In the approach proposed by Liu et al., the watermark W is added to the matrix of SVs S , and then a new SVD process is performed on the of watermark embedding are summarized as follows: 1. The SVD is performed on the original image ( F matrix).
 2. The watermark ( W matrix) is added to the SVs of the original matrix. 3. The SVD is performed on the new modified matrix ( D matrix).
 4. The watermarked image ( F w matrix) is obtained using the modified matrix ( S w matrix). and the possibly distorted image F w , the above steps are reversed as follows: 1. The SVD is performed on the possibly distorted watermarked image ( F w matrix).
 2. The matrix that includes the watermark is computed.
 3. The possibly corrupted watermark is obtained.

The * refers to the corruption due to attacks. 3. SVD image watermarking in the homomorphic domain expected that a watermark embedded in the reflectance component can survive several attacks, because watermarks are sub-sections, the steps of watermark embedding in the reflectance component of an image and watermark detection are presented. 3.1. Watermark embedding 1. The image intensities can be represented as follows ( Ghazy, El-Feshawy, Hadhoud, Dessouky, &amp; Abd El-Samie, 2007;
Gonzalez &amp; Woods, 2002 ): where i ( n 1 , n 2 ) is the light illumination and r ( n 1 , n 2 ) is the reflectance of the object to be imaged. 2. The homomorphic transform is performed in the form of matrices 4. The SVD is performed on the ( R matrix) 5. The watermark ( W matrix) is added to the SVs of the reflectance matrix.
 6. The SVD is performed on the new modified matrix ( D matrix).
 7. The watermarked reflectance matrix R w is obtained using the S w matrix.
 8. An inverse homomorphic transform is performed on I and R w to obtain a matrix X w .
 9. The watermarked image is obtained as follows:
We can notice from Eqs. (13) X (15) that the watermark affects the watermarked image in a multiplicative manner, which only. 3.2. Watermark detection and the possibly distorted image F w , the above steps are reversed as follows: 1. The homomorphic transform is performed on the possibly distorted watermarked image F w . 3. The SVD is performed on the R w matrix.
 4. The matrix that includes the watermark is computed.
 5. The possibly corrupted watermark is obtained.
 4. Block-by-block SVD watermarking in the homomorphic domain separately. The steps of watermark embedding and detection on a block-by-block basis are presented in the following sub-sections. 4.1. Watermark embedding 5. The matrix S is divided into non-overlapping blocks S b . 6. The watermark matrix W is added to each block.
 7. The watermarked blocks are combined back into a single matrix to build the S w matrix. 4.2. Watermark detection 5. The possibly corrupted watermark is obtained.
 5. SVD watermarking in the homomorphic domain with encrypted watermarks of the method of Liu and the proposed SVD watermarking in the homomorphic domain are used with encrypted watermarks.
The watermark is first encrypted with a 2-D chaotic Baker map and then embedded to the image and the extracted water-mark is decrypted.

The steps of randomization can be summarized as follows: 1. An N N square matrix is divided into l vertical rectangles of height N and width n i with n 1 + n 2 + ... n l = N ). 2. Each vertical rectangle is divided into n i blocks, and each block contains N points. 3. Each of these blocks is mapped to a row of pixels.

Several experiments have been carried out to compare between the method of Liu, and the proposed SVD watermarking in the homomorphic domain for the whole image and on a block-by-block basis. The 512 512 Airplane and color Baby minance (C b and C r components). The experiments demonstrate that watermark embedding in the luminance component (Y) pression; we have performed watermark embedding in the Y channel.

Fig. 4 shows the original image, the watermark, the watermarked image, and the extracted watermark using the method posed homomorphic method. It is clear that there is no visual difference between the original image and the watermarked the watermarked image in the method of Liu is 62.65 dB, and in the proposed method, the PSNR is 65.7 dB. The correlation marking in the homomorphic domain are 0.9 and 0.9993, respectively.

 watermarked images. Figs. 7 X 9 show the watermarked images and the extracted watermarks under attacks for all water-size 512 512 to 256 256 and back to 512 512. The third attack is addition of Gaussian noise with zero mean and 0.1 variance. The fourth attack is cropping. The fifth attack is rotation with 3  X  .
 posed SVD watermarking in the homomorphic domain after applying similar attacks. In all cases, the extracted watermarks and the superiority of the proposed SVD watermarking in the homomorphic domain.
 The results show that the detectability of the watermark has been greatly enhanced with the proposed block-by-block SVD watermarking method in the homomorphic domain. Watermark repetition has increased the probability that at least one watermark survives the attack.

The experimental results on the 512 512 color Baby image with the method of Liu, the SVD watermarking in the homo-morphic domain, and the block-by-block SVD watermarking in the homomorphic domain are shown in Figs. 10 X 13 . Tables 1 and 2 give correlation coefficient values for the Airplane and Baby images with all methods under different attacks. The obtained results reveal the superiority of watermarking in the homomorphic domain.

Some other experiments have been carried out to show the results of SVD watermarking and block-by-block SVD water-marking in the homomorphic domain with an encrypted watermark. The Baker map has been used for encryption. To mea-sure the quality of encryption, we estimate the correlation coefficient between the encrypted watermark and the original we estimate the correlation coefficient between the extracted decrypted watermark and the original watermark c r . The encrypted watermarks are shown in Figs. 14 X 16 and Table 3 . From these results, we notice that the watermarks can be decrypted and extracted successfully for both SVD and block-by-block SVD watermarking in the homomorphic domain. Thus, we can conclude that the proposed SVD watermarking and block-by-block SVD watermarking in the homomorphic domain can be used successfully with permutation-based encryption algorithms. 7.
