 1. Introduction
Since its introduction in the early 1990s, the Web has become one of the popular tools for information search and communication. It is often ranked as the most important source by many, and regarded as a good place to get everyday information by over 90% of Internet users ( Fallows, 2004 ).

As the Web rises in popularity, efforts have been made to understand how individuals search for informa-tion on the Web, and what factors influence the Web search behavior. Research shows that user and task dif-ferences account for over half of the key factors affecting user behavior on hypermedia systems ( Nielsen, 1989 ). Recent studies have revealed that users X  affective aspects have significant impacts on information behav-ior ( Bilal, 2000; Kurbanoglu, 2003; Nahl, 1998; Ren, 2000; Wang, Hawk, &amp; Tenopir, 2000 ). How users X  affec-tive characteristics interact with tasks and influence search behavior, however, has not been well understood.
The study aimed at investigating how experienced Web users navigate and search the Web. Effects of the user X  X  emotional control and tasks were examined in relation to the Web search behavior and performance. In addition, by using profile analyses, dominant patterns of search behaviors were identified and compared across tasks. Based on the findings, issues related to user-training and interface design are discussed and future studies are suggested. 2. Related studies
Although the Web is a popular source, searching the Web can be challenging. Users are not always efficient in navigating the Web and finding high quality resources. Depending on their preferences and styles, certain users might experience more difficulties than others when searching the Web ( Wang et al., 2000 ). Research on key factors and their effects on the search behavior would help improve the design of information systems and user training programs. Previous research suggests that information seeking on the Web is affected by user 2001; Wang et al., 2000; Wilson, 1999 ). This section will introduce and review related studies on how users X  affective characteristics and search tasks influence the search behavior. 2.1. Users X  affective characteristics and search behavior
Information-seeking behavior is influenced by users X  affective characteristics. While seeking for informa-tion, users go through different stages of actions and may experience different emotions such as anxiety and frustration ( Kuhlthau, 1991 ). How they manage their emotion during the search process seems to affect their search behavior and performance ( Bilal, 2001; Wang et al., 2000 ).

Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive model of human information-seeking behavior, Wilson (1999) called for studies exploring users X  affective variables, such as self-efficacy and problem-solving/coping action required to manage respective situations X  X  ( Bandura, 1977, 1986 ), and is found to be positively related to the search performance and online source usage ( Nahl, 1996; Ren, 2000 ). More recently, research shows that  X  X ffective coping skills X  consisting of self-efficacy and optimism have a positive impact on the performance in information tasks and that higher affective skills can compensate for lower cognitive skills ( Nahl, 2004, 2005 ).
 Coping strategies is another useful construct that stems from the  X  X tress and coping theory X  developed by
Lazarus (1966) . Two major forms of coping have been identified, namely emotion-focused and problem-focused coping. The former involves efforts to regulate the stressful emotions caused by an event, while the latter, efforts to control problems causing a stressful situation. It was found that emotion-focused users tend to navigate the Web rather linearly, and consecutively traversed a number of layers of nodes with little effort in the front-end-analysis ( Kim, 1999 ). 2.2. Task characteristics and search behavior
Researchers are increasingly aware of the importance of contexts and tasks in understanding information behavior (e.g., Allen &amp; Kim, 2001; Bystrom, 2000; Cool, 2001; Savolainen, 1995; Vakkari, 2003 ). Studies on
Web searching have also begun to investigate the effect of task types. Research shows that users usually go through more search steps and spend more time in ill-defined subject search tasks than in specific, fact-finding tasks ( Hsieh-Yee, 2001; Kim &amp; Allen, 2002 ). Findings on search strategies are rather inconsistent, however.
Hsieh-Yee and her colleagues found that users solved search problems in similar fashion regardless of search tasks ( Hsieh-Yee, Davidson, &amp; Ozgar, 1998 ), while others found that search strategies vary depending on tasks ( Bilal, 2000, 2001; Schacter, Chung, &amp; Dorr, 1998 ). Differences in participant groups and tasks might have contributed to the varying results of the studies. Clearly, more research needs to be done to investigate the effect of tasks on search behavior. 2.3. Interaction between task and user characteristics
Recognizing that user characteristics might interact with task types and influence search behaviors, a few studies have tested this interaction effect. Navarro-Prieto, Scaife, and Rogers (1999) found that different search strategies were used depending on task types (e.g., fact-finding vs. exploration task). The influence of tasks on
Web strategies was stronger among experienced Web users than novices. Kim and Allen (2002) found that task types interact with cognitive and problem solving styles and influence search behavior. Although there exist studies on the interaction between users and tasks, only few of them focused on users X  affective charac-teristics and their interaction with tasks. 3. Methods 3.1. Research questions and hypotheses
The study has two research questions: Among experienced Web users, (1) do users X  perceived ability of con-trolling emotion (hereafter, it will be called  X  X motion control X ) and search tasks influence the search perfor-mance? and (2) do the two variables affect the search behavior? Six hypotheses are established for the levels of search performance; (2) Individuals working on different search tasks (i.e., specific vs. general) will yield different levels of search performance; (3) Depending on the search task they are working on, the effect of individuals X  emotion control on search performance will vary; (4) Individuals with different levels of emo-tion control will search the Web differently; (5) Individuals working on different search tasks will search the
Web differently; and (6) Depending on the search task they are working on, the effect of individuals X  emotion control on search behavior will vary. 3.2. Participants
Sixty-seven undergraduate students participated in the study. Twenty (30%) of them were male while the others were female students. All of them were experienced Web users: Over 80% of them used the Web several times a day and the rest several times a week for more than three years. Regarding their background, 29 (43%) of them were from hard sciences and 34 (51%) from soft sciences. The participants consisted of freshmen (24%), sophomore (24%), junior (15%), and senior (37%) students. 3.3. Instruments
Two questionnaires were used in the study. One of them was Problem-Solving Inventory (PSI: Heppner, 1988 ), a standardized test consisting of 35 items rated on a 6-point scale. It measures general expectancies, rather than the actual abilities, of problem solving. One of the aspects measured by PSI is  X  X ersonal control X  (PC). The PC score reflects the extent to which individuals believe that they are in control of their emotions and behavior while solving problems ( Heppner, 1988 ). In addition to the PSI, a questionnaire was used to col-lect information on user demographics. 3.4. Procedure
Participants were asked to complete the PSI, followed by a questionnaire on their demographic and other background information. When the participants were ready, two search tasks were assigned: one to find a piece of specific information (specific task), and the other a few pieces of information for a rather general and broad question (general task). For the specific task, the participants were asked to find a Web page con-taining the target information and to continue the search until the information was found. For the general task, the participants were asked to find Web pages they considered to be relevant to the given task, and book-mark the pages. The general task was designed to simulate a board subject search that would usually require more than one piece of information related to the given topic. Thus, in the general task, the participants were asked to find and bookmark three or more relevant Web pages. For each task, the participants started their search from the same page  X  their university home page. They were free to select and use different Web search services in order to carry out the task. Netscape was used as the Web browser. While each participant was working on the given tasks, all the screen displays were video taped. 3.5. Independent variables
There were two independent variables in this experiment: emotion control and type of search tasks. Emo-tion control, measured by the PC score from PSI, reflects the perceived ability to control one X  X  emotion ( Mac-
Nair &amp; Elliott, 1992 ). Based on median split, participants were divided into two groups. As low PC scores indicate positive assessments of emotion control ability, those with lower PC scores were assigned to the High
Emotion Control (H-EC) group, while those with higher PC scores to the Low Emotion Control (L-EC) group. For the task variable, two types of tasks were used: specific vs. general search tasks. The specific search task required participants to locate one specific piece of information that was known to exist on the Web. In the study, it was the admission requirement information for a graduate school. The general task, on the other hand, required finding a few pieces of information on a broad topic, in this case, on human cloning. Partic-systems, sociology, etc.) and to select what they judged relevant among the Web pages they retrieved. These tasks were designed to be subject neutral. That is, the specific search task was non-domain specific; and the general search task was broad in scope so that all the participants could find relevant information regardless of their subject areas. 3.6. Dependent variables
Two different groups of dependent variables were used in the study: one for search performance and the other for search behavior. For the search performance analysis, task completion time (for the specific task) and precision (for the general task) were used. The task completion time is the length of time a searcher spent for the completion of a task, measured in seconds. Precision is defined as the ratio of the number of relevant documents retrieved to the total number of documents retrieved. In the study, the precision ratio was calcu-lated as follows: the number of relevant Web pages retrieved by the participant, divided by the total number of
Web pages retrieved by him or her. Here, relevant Web pages were operationally defined as pages bookmarked by at least three of the participants. Relevance was determined based on participants X  judgment. Recall  X  the ratio of the number of relevant documents retrieved to the total number of relevant documents existing in the database  X  is another way of measuring search performance. However, it has been found impractical in the
Web environment, as the total amount of information on the Web is constantly changing ( Gwizdka &amp; Chig-nell, 1999 ). Hence, recall was not used as a measure of search performance in the study. For measuring search behavior, the number of times that a navigation/search tool was used was counted. Here, navigation/search tools include embedded links, back, forward, home, jump tools (e.g., jump by using Go, History, typing
URL), and keyword search features. 3.7. Data analysis
The data collected were coded and analyzed statistically. To examine how users X  emotion control and search task affect their search performance (Research question 1), a repeated measures ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) was conducted. Two types of dependent variables were used for the ANOVA: task completion time was used for the specific search task, whereas precision was used for the general search task. As each of the dependent variables was measured in a different scale, standardized Z -scores were used for the analysis.
To investigate how users X  emotion control and search task influence their search behavior (Research question 2), a repeated measures MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance) was used with five dependent variables (the frequency of using different tools including back, forward, link, jump and keyword search). As none of the participants used the home button, the frequency of using the home was not included in the analysis. In addi-tion to the MANOVA and ANOVA, the Profile Analysis via Multidimensional Scaling (PAMS: Davison, 1996; Kim, Frisby, &amp; Davison, 2004 ) was conducted to examine search behavior patterns across tasks, using normalized scores of tool usage. 4. Results 4.1. Research question 1: effects of emotion control and task on search performance
To find out whether users X  emotion control and search task affect their search performance, a repeated mea-sures ANOVA was carried out. The ANOVA result showed that none of the main effects was significant ( Table 1 ).

A comparison of mean scores revealed an interesting interaction between emotion control and task, although the interaction was not significant at p &lt; .05 ( p = .056). Participants with low emotion control (L-EC) struggled in the general task, but not in the specific task. While showing the performance level compa-rable to their counterparts X  in the specific task, the L-ECs performed poorly in the general task (Mean 2.65; Mean H-EC = 2.73). That is, the level of search performance among the L-ECs was more than two stan-dard deviations below average whereas the performance level among the H-ECs was more than two standard deviations above average. The lower level of performance in the general task can be explained by what most individuals experience in a complex task. In the general task that is more complex than the specific task, search-ers may experience a higher level of uncertainty, generating negative feelings, such as stress and doubt ( Nahl, 2005 ). The L-ECs who cannot control their emotions effectively are more likely to be influenced by such neg-ative feelings spawned while working on the general task; and their performance might suffer. 4.2. Research question 2: effects of emotion control and task on navigation/search behavior To find out whether users X  emotion control and search task affect their way of navigating and searching the
Web, a repeated measures MANOVA was carried out with five dependent variables: the use of back, forward, embedded link, jump tools and keyword search.

Several studies on the effect of tasks on search behavior suggest that searchers tend to follow more search steps, use more tools, and have more difficulties in general subject search tasks than in specific fact-finding tasks ( Chen, Wang, Proctor, &amp; Salvendy, 1997; Hsieh-Yee, 2001; Kim &amp; Allen, 2002 ). Using the frequency of tool usage as the dependent variable, a MANOVA was carried out to verify findings of the previous studies.
As the tasks were designed to simulate a simple specific search and a complex general search requiring multiple pieces of information, it is predicted that the participants would use the navigation and search tools more fre-quently in the general task than in the specific task. This analysis will also test a less researched aspect  X  the interaction between emotion control and task. While a frequent tool usage is predicted in the general task, little is known about how users with different levels of emotion control would carry out searches in different tasks.

The analysis result revealed that the overall main effects for emotion control and search task were signif-icant ( Table 2 ). Users with different levels of emotion control tended to search the Web differently; and users working on different tasks searched the Web differently. In addition, the overall interaction between emotion control and task was significant. That is, the effect of users X  emotion control on the search behavior varied depending on search tasks they were working on.
 As the MANOVA result showed that all the main and interaction effects were significant, follow-up
ANOVAs were conducted to find out which search activities were significant and how they were affected by emotion control and task variables. The repeated measures ANOVA results are presented in Table 3 . 4.2.1. Main effect for emotion control
The main effect for emotion control was found significant at p &lt; .05. The follow-up ANOVA indicated that the use of two tools contributed to this difference: forward ( F = 4.588, p = .036); and keyword search ( F = 4.157, p = .046) (See Table 3 ). Participants rarely used the forward button, only ten doing so. When the frequency of using it was compared between the two groups of participants with different levels of emotion control, the L-ECs were found to use the forward button relatively more often than the H-ECs: Mean .15; Mean H-EC = .03. The L-ECs also used keyword searches more frequently than the H-ECs: Mean 1.15; Mean H-EC = .79. 4.2.2. Main effect for task
The main effect for task on the frequency of tool use was significant at p &lt; .01. The follow-up ANOVA revealed that the use of four tools was significantly affected: back ( F = 50.778, p = .000); link ( F = 9.098, p = .004); jump ( F = 128.56, p = .000); and keyword search ( F = 73.441, p = .000) (See Table 3 ). A compar-ison of mean scores revealed that participants used all of the four tools more frequently in the general task than in the specific task. (Back button: Mean Gen = 6.47, Mean Mean Spec = 6.75; Jump tools: Mean Gen = 1.43, Mean Spec = .09; Keyword search: Mean
Spec = .22). This is similar to what was found in previous studies: searchers tend to follow more search steps, using links, jumps and keyword searches more frequently in general search tasks than in specific tasks ( Hsieh-
Yee, 2001; Kim &amp; Allen, 2002 ). It is interesting to note that in the specific task, jump tools and keyword searches were rarely used. 4.2.3. Interaction between emotion control and task
An interaction effect was significant at p &lt; .05. Follow-up analyses showed that the use of forward was the task was significant, the main effect for the emotion control, which was found significant with the use of for-ward, needed to be interpreted in light of the interaction. When mean scores were compared, it was discovered that participants with different levels of emotion control used the forward button differently depending on the task they were working on. In the general task, the L-ECs used the forward button relatively often while the
H-ECs did not use it at all: Mean L-EC = .265; Mean H-EC = .00. 4.3. Further analysis of navigation/search behavior 4.3.1. Search tasks and individual search activities
To further examine the impact of search tasks on the navigation/search behavior, the use of different nav-igation/search tools in two different tasks was compared. For the use of each tool, mean scores were calculated and presented in Fig. 1 . In the general task, users were more involved in keyword searches and also self-ini-tiated jumps through jump tools and the back button. In the specific task, on the other hand, users utilized embedded links frequently. Although the embedded links were frequently used in the general task as well, constituted 83.8% of the overall tool usage, while it was only 48.7% in the general task. It is speculated that keyword searches and jumps are used mostly for locating useful sources whereas links are often used for exam-ining the content within a source. As the specific task requires users to find a piece of target information, once reaching a source that is likely to contain the information, the users might not feel a great need to use jumps or keyword searches. To locate the target information in a promising source site, they might prefer to use links provided within the site. 4.3.2. Search tasks and overall search behavior Profiles based on mean scores of individual tool usage showed how frequently different tools were used.
Because the use of an individual tool was treated as an independent activity, however, such profiles could not help us identify the dominant patterns of search activities as a whole. To find out the most common pat-terns of search activities, another approach  X  PAMS  X  was employed.

Profile Analysis via Multidimensional Scaling (PAMS) is one of the methods that can help identify  X  X  X ajor X  X  or  X  X  X rototypical X  X  profiles, which represent a smaller number of normative profile types that reflect the most commonly occurring profiles in a given data set. It is a method of profile analysis that extends the use of simple multidimensional scaling (MDS) methods, and is often used for identifying latent profiles in a multi-compo-nent test ( Davison, Kuang, &amp; Kim, 1998; Kim et al., 2004 ). To identify the predominant profile pattern of search behavior, the PAMS method was adopted in the study. Appendix A shows the equation of this model.
A PAMS analysis involves two parts: (1) estimation of major profiles in a group of individuals, and (2) estimation of a personal profile index. The normalized frequencies of using five different tools served as input variables in the initial stages of the PAMS analysis. The first step in a PAMS procedure is to conduct a simple multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis on proximity data. In the current study, proximity data used were squared Euclidian distances between every possible pair of navigation/search activities. In the first stage,
PAMS uses a non-metric scaling procedure  X  alternating least squares scaling (ALSCAL) ( Takane, Young, &amp; de Leeuw, 1977 )  X  which estimates scale-values (or dimension coordinates). The original person  X  compo-nent score (67 persons  X  5 observed variables) matrix was analyzed in the first stage of the PAMS procedure using the ALSCAL program ( Takane et al., 1977 ). ALSCAL performs a simple MDS on this matrix, and scale-values (dimension coordinates) for all observed variables (for all participants) were computed on all extracted latent dimensions. Here, each of the five tool usage variables would have a corresponding coordinate for each extracted latent dimension from the MDS analysis. Major profiles were extracted, and an index of model fit was calculated.

Based on the fit result, the optimal number of major profiles for the given data was determined. The index of model fit (stress value) reflects the extent to which the MDS dimension coordinates for each search activity
Another important statistic is R 2 , which indicates the extent to which the model can explain the variance in the scaled data. The higher the R 2 value, the better the model is. Conventionally, the stress value lower than .05, and the R 2 value higher than .95 are recommended for a model to be a good fit. Based on the criteria, the number of major profiles was determined. For example, a one-profile solution was selected for the specific search task, as it yielded R 2 = .99 and stress = .04.

The last step is to represent individual differences in profile patterns, using estimates of person param-eters (i.e., personal profile index). Each person parameter quantifies the degree of correspondence between the observed profile of that individual (i.e., an array of that individual X  X  actual scores) and the prototypical profile ( Ding, 2001; Kim et al., 2004 ). To estimate person parameters in the PAMS model, the original five observed component scores of a person (observed scores for the use of back, forward, link, jump, and keyword search, serving as dependent variables) were regressed onto the major profile coordinate values from the MDS analysis (serving as independent variables). The current study will present the result of the first but not the second step, as its interest is in examining the predominant profile pattern of search behavior. 4.3.2.1. Major profile pattern of search activities in specific search task. The PAMS result showed that the one-profile solution was suitable to explain the search behavior in the specific task: stress = .04; R profile solution was a good fit to the data (stress &lt; .05) and explains 99% of the variance in the scaled data ( R 2 = .99). The identified major profile is presented in Fig. 2 .

The major profile is illustrated by a line graph, which reflects the coordinates obtained from an MDS ana-lysis of the five component scores from the use of tools. The size of the peaks and valleys defines the relative  X  X  X aliency X  X  of particular components relative to all components in the total data set. The profile peaks and val-leys do not reflect the direction of the frequency within the salient components. For example, a high peak on
This frequency information can be obtained by analyzing the search activities of participants with high weights on the major profile.

The extracted profile suggests that the usage pattern of most tools, except jump and keyword search, is quite similar across participants. As indicated by a peak and a valley, the use of jump tools and the use of keyword search are the salient activities that substantially varied among participants. It was found that par-ticipants who used jump tools did not use keyword searches and vice versa. the two-profile solution, explaining 99% of the variance in the scaled data ( R major profiles are displayed in Fig. 3 .

Profile 1, the most dominant profile, shows that the profile pattern of search activities is similar across par-ticipants, except the use of three tools, including forward, jump and keyword search. Participants who rarely used the forward button tended to use jump tools and keyword searches more often, and vice versa. Profile 2 reveals a somewhat different profile pattern: only two activities  X  the use of forward and keyword search  X  are the salient ones. Participants who used the forward button relatively more often also used the keyword search.
This pattern coincides with the L-ECs X  search behavior (see Section 4.2.1 ). 5. Discussion and conclusion
The study findings suggest that both tasks and emotion control (EC) have an impact on users X  search behavior. Findings on task effect are supported by other studies: users tend to get engaged in more search cycles and use more search/navigation tools in a general search task than in a specific task ( Hsieh-Yee, 2001; Kim &amp; Allen, 2002 ). More research is needed to find out why individuals working on different tasks use the tools differently. Through think aloud or interview methods, for example, researchers might be able to collect information that can explain what characteristics of a task lead to frequent use of certain tools.

Findings also indicate that users X  emotion control (EC) interacts with search tasks and influences the search behavior. In the general task, for example, the L-ECs tend to use the forward button more often than the H-ECs. Previous research shows that people rarely use forward while navigating the Web ( Kari, 2004;
Tauscher &amp; Greenberg, 1997 ). The back-and-forth movement between already visited pages seems to be redundant and inefficient. Compared to such linear navigations, using jump tools is regarded as a more less frequently than the H-ECs. The L-ECs X  frequent use of keyword searches in the general task is also note-worthy. Keyword searches are usually viewed as active and analytical search activities ( Qiu, 1993 ). However, keyword searches by the L-ECs could not be considered as analytical searches, because additional analyses revealed that the L-ECs simply repeated the same keyword searches without modifying their queries.
Overall, the L-ECs tended to make frequent and quick search moves. Such activities seemed to intensify when the task was loosely defined. In the specific task, the L-ECs achieved a level of performance comparable to the H-EC X  X . In the general task, however, the L-ECs did not fare so well as the H-ECs, despite their seem-ingly active search behavior. Studies show that in complex/difficult tasks, users experience a high level of and more complex. It requires more active search and planning from the searcher, and yields a higher level of uncertainty. The L-ECs are less likely to have such negative feelings under control, and, as a result, their search behavior and performance may be hampered in the general task. Although it was not significant at p &lt; .05 ( p = .056), the interaction between emotion-control and task, and its effect on search performances deserve further investigation.

A profile analysis of search behavior via PAMS offered insights on dominant behavior patterns as well as unique search activities distinguishing users with different search patterns. Treating search activities as a whole, such a method can help us triangulate and complement the findings based on mean comparisons of individual activities.
 The study findings point to some implications for information literacy (IL) education and interface design.
Participants demonstrated a certain level of flexibility in their behavior depending on search tasks, which indi-cates the importance of experience and training. However, some individuals, such as the L-ECs, would still ben-efit from IL training. When problems are not well defined/structured, searchers have to play an active role in problem solving, including defining the target information, making plans for searching, formulating queries, etc. Such complex, ill-defined tasks may put more strain on the users X  emotions. The L-ECs are less likely to handle pressure well, which might make them stressed and distracted, therefore making more frequent, hasty and inefficient search moves. Well-designed IL programs can nurture users X  confidence in information searching as well as develop their upper-level skills, including the planning of an effective search. Previous studies show that confidence can be enhanced through positive feedback and successful experience, which could be incorpo-hands-on training sessions at their own pace  X  beginning with easier tasks and moving through more complex tasks, it would help them build confidence. As users tend to perform better in domains they are familiar with ( Ho  X  lscher &amp; Strube, 2000 ), IL programs embedded in the users X  knowledge domain might also help users become more successful and confident ( Bruce, 1995, 2002 ). To facilitate the search process, system designers will need to incorporate effective features in the search interface. Recommending useful search terms or visually displaying already visited and other related Web sites might help lessen the cognitive and affective burden on the searcher, and facilitate effective jumps ( Cockburn &amp; Jones, 1996; Schafer, Konstan, &amp; Riedl, 2002 ). It should be noted that the study has some limitations and the findings should be generalized with caution.
In the current study, tasks used were imposed by the researcher and carried out in a controlled setting. Users might behave differently when the tasks are initiated by the users themselves or when they are embedded in a setting more meaningful to them (e.g., in a real class or work setting). A replication of the study in a natural setting would be necessary to validate the findings, which will also help us to understand better the effect of emotion control, tasks, and other related variables (e.g., motivation) on Web search behavior. In the current study, the sample used and its size were also limited. A study with a larger and more representative sample will improve the generalizability of the study findings.

In the emerging area of users X  affective domain and Web search behavior, previous studies shed light on study have revealed that certain affective propensities, such as emotion control, play an important role in Web searches; and suggested areas of improvement in IL programs and information systems. Further research is called for in order to better understand the interaction between users X  affective propensities and tasks attempted. Future studies can investigate users X  search behavior in an extended period of time, and examine how their behavior changes over time  X  in different stages of the information search process ( Kuhlthau, 2004 ), for example. Investigating how different affective propensities ( Nahl, 2005 ) and task types ( Kim &amp; Soergel, 2005 ) influence the search behavior in different user groups will also be useful. Such research will be able to capture the dynamic and intricate relationship between users X  cognition, affect and tasks during the search process. Acknowledgements
