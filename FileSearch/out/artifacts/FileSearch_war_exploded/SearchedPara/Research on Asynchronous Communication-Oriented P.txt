 With the development of network communication technology, the traditional web application model of client/server and correlative N layer frame construction has following two aspects. Firstly, with the traditional web model, web application is done through synchronous communication. Thus, the client has to wait for the experience. Secondly, the traditional web model adopts a whole page refreshing mechanism, by which a lot of data of the server backs out leading to the increase of network delay and load and the waste of network communication resources. As a result, an asynchronous communication model represented by Ajax emerges[3] which has the following strengths[4]: First, asynchronous communication. When the user the server. And the Ajax will automatically refresh the page showing the result when sent, which reduces redundant requests, lessens the burden on the server and cuts down the gross data downloading. Third, partial refreshing. It only refreshes the and alleviates the burden on the server. 
The adoption of asynchronous communication has promoted the development of the adoption of asynchronous communication the majority of labels will lose the HREF property, and the traditional directly extracting HREF property WebPages crawl technology based on hyperlink analysis will lose its effect. Secondly, it is very difficult and of great importance to extract integrated and accurate URL and to assure ordinal and non-repeating visits, becau se within the website adopting the asynchronous communication technology, it is impossible to get all URL lists when visiting the WebPages, the URL is extracted while the function is being sent. Thirdly, mechanism by which the traditional search engine uses URL as the primary key and stores the server response content in database is not advisable. Based on this, research on asynchronous communication-oriented page searching has become a new field. 
At present, a lot of researches have been done on page search engine both at home and abroad. For example, Michael Kohlhase [5] has presented a search engine for mathematical formulae. W. John Wilburwe[6] describes the methodology he has developed to perform spelling correction for the PubMed search engine.Chen Hanshen[7] discusses a new intelligentized and personalized search engine based on server port and client port. Tan Yihong[8] has put forward a method of query expansion based on the association rules-based databases. But none of the above mentioned researches aim at page searching of asynchronous communication website. Up till now, there are no papers on asynchronous communication-oriented page searching. Therefore, the asynchronous communication-oriented page searching approach presented in this paper may serve as an introduction so that other researches may come up with valuable opinions. There are not many obvious HRFE on the WebPages adopting asynchronous Script code. Therefore, for the WebPages adopting asynchronous communication more necessary to have the WebPages additionally processed to enable the crawler to collect the great number of URL hyperlinks hidden in JavaScript code. Furthermore, because of the adoption of partial refreshing technology, feedback information of the remote server corresponding to the URL hyperlink hidden in the script code is not an integrated HTML WebPages, which cannot store any data unless processed. Thus, compared with the traditional WebPages crawler, the asynchronous communication-extraction and WebPages storage. In accordance with the characteristics of asynchronous communication technology, this paper has improved the workflow of the traditional crawler. The main workflow is as follows: (2) For the WebPages adopting asynchronous communication technology, the URL (3) When the current URL hyperlink visited by the crawler is logged in, it suggests that The common crawler spider can only visit the main code of the page that is the contents of HTML, so it is not able to effectively extract URL hyperlinks of the WebPages adopting asynchronous communication technology. In order to enable the spider to have access to the contents of the script codes, it is necessary to provide the crawler with an environment that may guarantee the function of the script codes. In addition, the crawler should be able to produce corresponding mouse or keyboard events so that it can guarantee JavaScript events. The concrete workflow is as follows. Step1: To give the WebPages under processing a unique number for registration. Step2: To analyze the page property, comp are page character string according to the Step3: To provide JavaScript with an operation environment to guarantee the well run Step4: To monitor the port in the local area, intercept the request if it is sent from the Step5: To output URL hyperlinks and add URL to the request queue. 
According to the above extracting flow, this paper divides the whole hyperlink event function list and adding it to the event list. The event producer is responsible for reading the event list and producing mouse or keyboard events in accordance with event type. The URL interceptor is in charge of monitoring the port and intercepting requests before sending them to the HTTP message analyzer. The HTTP message analyzer is in charge of the analysis of the message, the extraction of URL, the registration of the message contents and so on. The crawler X  X  workflow of hyperlink extraction and subsystem processing is shown in Figure 1. The feedback information from the server of a WebPages adopting asynchronous communication technology varies. It X  X  not an integrated page, possibly a part of the page or only an XML file, or even several JavaScript functions. But the search engine indexer requires an integrated page. Therefore, the feedback information must be reprocessed, as the crawler cannot directly store it. Asynchronous communication technology usually callback function could be called and the page refreshed. And then the refreshed page is saved as a page storage cell. The whole page storage flow is as follows: Step1: To read URL queue and judge whether the URL is extracted from a WebPages Step2: Load in URL and request data from the host computer when the link with the host Step4: Look up in the registration list the source page URL corresponding to the Step5: Use the homepage URL to request the source page contents from the server. Step6: Load in both the source page and the delay-stored data to the operation demonstrative page as a reference to make a simple contrast between the searching effects of the asynchronous communication-oriented crawler and the common full Text search engine crawler, see Table1 for the URL addresses collected by the (http://openrico.org/rico/demos.page?demo=rico_ajax_inner_HTML) common full text search engine crawler or by the asynchronous communication-oriented crawler based on hyperlink analysis. 
By contrasting Column A with Column B in Table 1, we can see the items after number 24 in Column B disappear in Column A, it is obvious that the asynchronous communication-oriented mechanism crawler designed and realized in this paper is superior to the traditional full text search engine crawler. WebPages adopting the asynchronous communication technology. With the aid of script operation environment and windows message response, the hyperlinks hidden that the feedback information from the server is no longer an integrated page that can experiment, the asynchronous communication-oriented page searching technology proposed in this paper is effective. Nevertheless, the asynchronous communication-oriented page searching technology is a very complicated process, I would like to do further research on such problems as how to exploit lightweight JavaScript operation environment and how to optimize saving the WebPages adopting the asynchronous communication technology.
