 Because English has established itself as something of a global lingua franca, many languages are cur-rently undergoing a process of introducing new loan-words borrowed from English. However, while the motivations for borrowing are well studied, includ-ing e.g. the need to express concepts that do not have corresponding expressions in the recipient language, and the social prestige associated with the other lan-guage (Hock and Joseph, 1996), the dynamics of this process are poorly understood. While mainstream political debates often frame borrowing as evidence of cultural or linguistic decline, it is particularly per-vasive in youth culture, which is often heavily influ-enced by North American trends. In many countries around the globe, hip hop fans form communities in which novel, creative uses of English are highly val-ued (Pennycook, 2007), indicative of group mem-bership, and relatively frequent. We therefore study which factors contribute to the uptake of (hip hop-related) anglicisms in an online community of Ger-man hip hop fans over a span of 11 years. We collected a  X  12.5M word corpus (MZEE) of fo-rum discussions from March 2000 to March 2011 on the German hip hop portal MZEE.com. A man-ual analysis of 10K words identified 8.2% of the tokens as anglicisms, contrasting with only 1.1% anglicisms in a major German news magazine, the Spiegel (Onysko, 2007, p.114). These anglicisms include uninflected English stems (e.g., battle, rap-per, flow ) as well as English stems with English in-flection (e.g., battled, rappers, flows ), English stems with German inflection (e.g., gebattlet, rappern, flowen  X  X attled, rappers, to flow X ), and English stems with German derivational affixes (e.g., battlem  X  assig, rapperische, flowendere  X  X attle-related, rapper-like, more flowing X ), as well as compounds with one or more English parts (e.g., battleraporientierter, hiphopgangstaghettorapper, maschinengewehrflow  X  X omeone oriented towards battle-rap, hip hop-gangsta-ghetto-rapper, machinegun flow X ). We also collected a  X  20M word corpus (Covo) of English-language hip hop discussion (May 2003 -November 2011) from forums at ProjectCovo.com. In order to identify novel anglicisms in the MZEE corpus, we have developed a classifier which can identify anglicism candidates, includ-ing those which incorporate German material (e.g., m  X  ochtegerngangsterstyle  X  X annabe gangster style X ), with very high recall. Since we are not interested in well-established anglicisms (e.g., Baby , OK ), non-English words, or placenames, our goal is quite different from the standard language identification problem, including Alex (2008) X  X  inclusion classi-fier, which sought to identify  X  X oreign words X  in general, including internationalisms, homographic words, and non-German placenames, but ignored hybrid/bilingual compounds and English words with German morphology during evaluation. Our final system consists of a binary classifier augmented with dictionary lookup for known words and two routines to deal with German morphology (affixa-tion and compounding).
 The baseline classifier We used MALLET (Mc-Callum, 2002) to train a maximum entropy classi-fier, using character 1-through 6-grams (including word boundaries) as features. Since we could not manually annotate a large portion of the MZEE cor-pus, the training data consisted of the disjoint sub-sets of the English and German CELEX wordlists (Baayen et al., 1995), as well as the words used in Covo (to obtain coverage of hip hop English). We tested the classifier using 10-fold cross valida-tion on the training data and on a manually anno-tated development set of 10K consecutive tokens from MZEE. All data was lowercased (this improved performance). We excluded from both data sets 4,156 words shared by the CELEX wordlists (such as Greek/Latin loanwoards common to both lan-guages and homographs such as hat ), 100 common German and 50 common English stop words, all 3-character words without vowels and 1,019 hip hop artists/label names, which reduced the development set from 10K tokens, or 3,380 distinct types, to 4,651 tokens and 2,741 types.
 Affix-stripping Since German is a moderately in-flected language, anglicisms are often  X  X idden X  by German morphology: in geflowt  X  X lowed X , the En-glish stem flow takes German participial affixes. We therefore included a template-based affix-stripping preprocessing step, removing common German af-fixes before feature extraction. Because of the possibility of multiple prefixation or suffixation (e.g. rum-ge-battle ( X  X attling around X ) or deep-er-en ( X  X eeper X )), we stripped sequences of two prefixes and/or three suffixes. Our list of affixes was built from commonly-affixed stems in the MZEE corpus and a German grammar (Fagan, 2009).
 Compound-cutting Nominal and adjectival com-pounding is common in German, and loanword compounds are commonly found in MZEE: (1) a. chart | tauglich ( X  X uitable for the charts X ) Since these contain features that are highly indica-tive of German (e.g. -lich# ,  X  a , and pf ), we devised a compound-cutting procedure for words over length l (=7): if the word is initially classified as German, it is divided several ways according to the param-eters n (=3), the number of cuts in each direction from the center, and m (=2), the minimum length of each part. Both halves are classified separately, and if the maximum anglicism classifier score out of all splits exceeds a target confidence c (=0.7), the orig-inal word is labeled a candidate anglicism. Parame-ter values were optimized on a subset of compounds from the development set.
 Dictionary classification When applying the clas-sifier to the MZEE corpus, words which occur ex-clusively in one of the German and English CELEX wordlists are automatically classified as such. This improved classifier results over tokens and types, as seen in Table 1 in the comparison of token and type precision for the dict/nodict conditions.
 Evaluation We evaluated our system by adjusting the classifier threshold to obtain a recall level of 95% or higher on anglicism tokens in the development set (see Table 1). The final classifier achieved a per-token precision of 70% (per type: 67%) at 95% re-call, a gain of 7% (9%) over the baseline.

Our system identified 1,415 anglicism candidate types with a corpus frequency of 100 or greater, out of which we identified 851 (57.5%) for further in-vestigation; 441 (31.1%) were either established an-glicisms, place names, artist names, and other loan-words, and 123 (8.7%) were German words. We examine here factors hypothesized to play a role in the establishment (or decline) of anglicisms. Frequency in the English Covo corpus We first examine whether a word X  X  frequency in the English-speaking hip hop community influences whether it becomes more frequently used in the German hip hop community. We aligned four large ( &gt; 1M words each) 12-month time windows of the Covo and MZEE corpora, spanning the period 11-2003 through 11-2007. We used the 851 most fre-quent anglicisms identified in our system to find 106 English stems commonly used in German anglicisms, and compute their relative frequency (aggregated over all word forms) in each Covo and MZEE time window. We then measure cor-relation coefficients r between the frequency of a stem in Covo at time T t , f E t ( stem ) , and the change in log frequency of the corresponding an-glicisms in MZEE between T t and a later time T u ,  X  log 10 f G t : u ( w ) = log 10 f G u ( w )  X  log 10 as well as the corresponding p -values, and coeffi-cients of determination R 2 (Table 2). There is a sig-nificant positive correlation between the variables, especially for change over a two-year time span. Initial frequency and dissemination in MZEE In studying the fate of all words in two En-glish Usenet corpora, Altmann, Pierrehumbert and Motter (2011, p.5) found that the measures D U (dissemination over users) and D T (dissemina-tion over threads) predict changes in word fre-quency (  X  log 10 f ) better than initial word fre-quency ( log 10 f ). D U = U w  X  of the actual number of users of word w ( U w ) over the expected number of users of w (  X  U w ), and D T = number of threads in which w is used.  X  U w and  X  T w are estimated from a bag-of-words model approxi-mating a Poisson process.

We apply Altmann et al. X  X  model to study the dif-ference in word dynamics between anglicisms and native words. Since we are not able to lemma-tize the entire MZEE corpus, this study uses the 851 most common anglicism word forms identified by our system, treating all word forms as distinct. We split the MZEE corpus into six non-overlapping windows of 2M words each ( T 1 through T 6 ), cal-culate D U t ( w ) , D T t ( w ) and log 10 f t ( w ) within each time window T t . We again measure how well these variables predict the change in log frequency  X  log 10 f t : u ( w ) = log 10 f u ( w )  X  log 10 f t ( w ) be-tween the initial time T t and a later time T u , with u = t + 1 , ..., t + 3 .

When measured over all words excluding angli-cisms, log 10 f t , D U t , and D T t at an initial time are very weakly ( 0 . 0309 &lt; r &lt; 0 . 0692 ), but sig-nificantly ( p &lt; . 0001 ) positively correlated with  X  log 10 f t : u . However, in contrast to Altmann et al. X  X  findings that D U and D T serve better than fre-quency as predictors of word fate, for the set of an-glicisms (Table 3), all correlations were both nega-tive and stronger, and initial frequency log 10 f t (not dissemination) is the best predictor, especially as the time spans increase in length. That is, while most words X  frequency change cannot generally be pre-dicted from earlier frequency, we find that, for an-glicisms, a high frequency is more likely to lead to a decline, and vice versa. 1 .
Finally, from the comparison of timespans in Ta-ble 3, we see that the predictive ability ( R 2 ) of the three measures increases as the timespan for  X  log 10 f becomes longer, i.e., frequency and dis-semination effects on frequency change do not oper-ate as strongly in immediate time scales. 2 . In this study, we examined factors hypothesized to influence the propagation of words through a com-munity of speakers, focusing on anglicisms in a Ger-man hip hop discussion corpus. The first analysis presented here sheds light on the lexical dynamics between the English and German hip hop commu-nities, demonstrating that English frequency corre-lates positively with change in a borrowed word X  X  frequency in the German community X  X his result is not shocking, as the communities are exposed to shared inputs (e.g., hip hop lyrics), but the strength of this correlation is highest in a two-year timespan, suggesting a time lag from the frequency of hip hop terms in English to the effects on those terms in Ger-man. Future research here could profitably focus on this relationship, especially for terms whose success in the English and German hip hop communities is highly disparate. Investigation of those terms could suggest non-frequency factors which affect a word X  X  success or failure.

The second analysis, which compared three mea-sures used by Altmann, Pierrehumbert, and Mot-ter (2011) to predict lexical frequency change, found that log 10 f , D U , and D T did not predict frequency change well for non-anglicism words in the MZEE corpus, but that log 10 f in particular does predict fre-quency change for anglicisms, though this correla-tion is inverse; this finding relates to another analysis of loanwords. In a diachronic study of loanword fre-quencies in two French newspaper corpora, Chesley and Baayen (2010, p.1364-5) found that high initial frequency was  X  X  bad omen for a borrowing X  and found an interaction effect between frequency and dispersion (roughly equivalent to dissemination in the present study):  X  X s dispersion and frequency in-crease, the number of occurrences at T2 decreases. X 
A view of language as a stylistic resource (Cou-pland, 2007) provides some explanation for these counter-intuitive findings: An anglicism which is used less often initially but survives is likely to in-crease in frequency as other speakers adopt it for  X  X red X  or in-group prestige. However, a highly frequent anglicism seems to become increasingly undesirable X  X fter all, if everyone is using it, it loses its capacity to distinguish in-group members (con-sider, e.g., the widespread adoption of the term bling outside hip hop culture in the US). This circum-stance is reflected by a drop in frequency as the word becomes pass  X  e. This view is supported by ethno-graphic interviews with members of the German hip hop community:  X  X eah, [the use of anglicisms is] naturally overdone, for the most part.

In summary, the analyses discussed here lever-age the opportunities provided by large-scale cor-pus analysis and by the uniquely language-focused nature of the hip hop community to investigate is-sues of sociohistorical linguistic concern: what sort of factors are at work in the process of linguis-tic change through contact, and more specifically, which word-extrinsic properties of stems and word-forms condition the success and failure of borrowed English words in the German hip hop community.
