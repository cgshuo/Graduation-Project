 The evolution of products is like the interaction between organisms in ecology. It means that two or more products depend on each other for resource sharing and collaborative development . To research the process of product evolution, many scholars use international trade data, especially export data, to explore the relationship between economic growth and exports.

Most studies focus on the analysis of the determinants of exports , such as the intensity of labor [1] , FDI [2] , technological soph istication [3 ,4 ] , etc . Hidalgo et.al. [ 5 ] integrated complex network theory into exports and put forward the conception of product space to explain subs equent economic growth. The product space is c omposed of nodes and lines in which each node represent a kind of product and each line means the relationship between two products. Therefore, product space contributes to establish ing the visualization of a country X  X  product structure, and identifying the transmission process of product comparative advantage . On the basis of this research, some extended research has been proposed. Jankowska [ 6 ] adopts the product space methodology to c ompare the structural transformation in Asia and Latin America to explain the middle -income trap in specified regions . Michael L Pace [7 ] described the structure and evolution of the global seafood trade network, including metrics quantifying the globalization of seafood, shifts in bilateral trade flows, changes in centrality and comparisons of seafood to agricultural and industrial trade networks.

Though the research of global economy in the field of product evolution has proliferated in recent ye ars, further study in analyzing product evolution process, especially mutualistic environment , is still lacking. In addition , there are some existing limitations in a few current related research : (i) The sample size of the panel data is so small that it i s difficult to obtain statistical significance (ii) Some research focus on the process of product evolution and neglect the process of product degradation (iii) Some validation of simulation has not been taken to measure the accuracy of simulation method.
 In the following, we calculate joint probability of product portfolio with Monte Carlo method to simulate the process of product development under various mutualistic environment for China, India, Japan and America and verify the simulation results by statistical test for selected countries . In addition, we simulate China X  s future product evolution with government policy and compare the simulations to provide the suggestion for developm ent for China . The The trade data are originally obtained from Un ited Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database. The paper uses disaggregated export data across 241 countries for the period 1984 -2010, including export value of each country. The variety of products are classified by Standard International Trade Classification (SITC), which is a classification of goods used to classify the exports and imports of a country to compile international trade statistics on all merchandise en tering international trade and promote international comparability of international trade statistics. In accordance with SITC, products are divided into 10 categories, including 0 class (food and live animals), 1 class (beverages and tobacco), 2 class (cru de materials, inedible, except fuels), 3 class (mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials), 4 class (animal and vegetable oils, fats and waxes),5 class (chemicals and related products), 6 class (manufactured goods classified chiefly by material), 7 c lass (machinery and transport equipment), 8 class (miscellaneous manufactured articles), 9 class (commodities and transactions not classified elsewhere in the SITC). In the following, the annual exports of diverse countries can be classified into 781, whic h significantly contributes to make horizontal comparison.
 We process the available data based on Balassa X  X  Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) [ 8 ] ,and Hidalgo et.al.  X  X  proximity [ 5 ] . The first index calculates the relative advantage or disadvantage of a certain country in a certain class of goods or services as evidenced by trade flows. The processed results of Revealed Comparative Advantage Index (RCA) were provided by formula (1) based on export value as follows: where represen ts export volume of product j from country i, is the total export volume from country i, is world expo rt volume of product j, and is world total export volume , and m, n is t he total number of product classification (according to SITC, m=n=781). Generally, if is greater than one , we consider that product j exported by country i has a certain advantage. Relatively, if is less than one , country i is not an effective exporter of product j. The second index constructs the relationship between two products. The formula of proximity is as follows:
Where is conditional probability of exporting good i given that a country exports good j in t year. In the definition, Hidalgo et.al. [ 5 ] considered the minimum between both conditional probabilities . Generally, we consider that high proximity indicates close relationship between two products.
 However, the definition of Hidalgo et.al.  X  X  proximity [ 5 ] exists some limitations: (i) They calculated proximity based on panel data in 1998 -2000. In statistics, inadequate time samples will lead to the deviation of results, and thus it is better to select 10 or more periods to ensure the stability of data. (ii) T hey constructed the relationship by symmetrical proximity. However, in reality, the interaction between products is not entirely symmetrical that good i may has significant influence on good j while good j scarcely has influence on good i. Hence, the matrix of proximity needs to be constructed asymmetrically. (iii) Hidalgo et.al  X  s proximity is used to measu re the similarity between two products. Based on the proximity, they calculated the probability of developing RCA given that the closest connected product is at proximity and simulated subsequent transmission of product advantage. However, proximity by H idalgo et.al is a stock variable that measures product -product rel ationship at one specific year, while the process of developing RCA is a flow variable that describes the changes in competitiveness of products. So it is not a very suitable variable to reflect the transmission of product advantage in the product space from the previous year to the next year. To solve these problems, we transform the original definition into a new conception called transitivity. T he improved formula of transitivity is as follows:
We improved formula of transitivity to construct transmission of comparative advantage s among products as well as to visualize and study the dynamics of product evolution. With modified transitivity , the product space should be relocated and optimized, including four aspects: (i) applying the dissymmetrical transitivity to the product space. (ii) construct i ng a weighted directed network as a product space (iii) relocating the product space with the atlas force model [9] that aggregates the related nodes. (iv) dividing the product space into a certain number of communities.

W e painted the product space using the community division of resolution level that adjusts the number of community divisions . Generally, the higher resolution level we select, the more communities will be divided. Here, we select the resolution level at 0.5 to identify the significant partition. Besides, we make the size of the nodes proportional to the degree of importance. In fig1, i t is intuitively plausible that product space is divided into two parts, and related products form the clusters in terms of h igh transitivity . In the following, more details about product space and simulation method will be introduced. With international trade data , we define the product X  X  competitiveness as three statuses: high competitive products (RCA ) , middle competitive products (RCA ) ) , low competitive products (RCA ) . In the following, we will simplify expression of the status of product i to and determine its competitive status with abbreviation ,
Next, we construct the formula to calculate the status probability of a kind of product under specified product portfolio . In the formula, we need to select the suitable products as the mutualistic environment , and calculated the probability of status transition for each product under different status combination of selected product. The formula is as follow: where represent s the status of specified product. The formula indicates the probability of stat us transformation for product j given specified mutualistic environment .

So h ow to define the environment (mix of products) is very essential to subsequent evolution . Here, we assume three scenes for the environment: (i) selecting status combination of top three competitive products in each country as mutualism environment. (ii) selecting status combination of core node s surrounding with other related nodes in product space as mutualism environ ment. (iii) selecting status combination of critical path nodes in product space as mutualism environment.

Fig 2 shows the community division of the product space . The above square frame represents clothing cluster, including dresses, skirts, and outerwear. The left side of it is electronics clusters, including diodes, transistors, electronic microc ircuits and electrical machinery, and the right side of it is food cluster , including chilled fish, smoked fish and crustaceans. And the bottom cluster is components of various type of products. Besides, it is obvious that some nodes such as dishwashers, s ilicones and non -ferrous base metals play critical path roles in the whole network that connecting to large product clusters.

To list the components of environment quantifiably , we calculate two index es in the social network analysis as the indicator s of core products and critical path products. The first index is cl ustering coefficient which measure s the degree to which nodes in a network tend to cluster together. The second index is eige nvector centrality which measures the influence of a node in a network. It assigns relative scores to all nodes base d on the concept ion that connections to high -scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the nodes in question than equal connections to low -scoring nodes.
With three mutualistic environment above and probability by formula (4), we import some countries X  RCA in 1984 as ou r simulated starting point. After 26 iterations by the probability calculated by formula (4), we can obtain the simulation results in 2010. Fig.3 shows the main procedures of our research content and method .
 Based on Monte Carlo simulations which are computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results , we simulated the product evolution under three scenes of representative countries, including C hina, India, Japan and America fo r 1000 times ( analysis of variance P &lt; ). Besides, we simulated the subsequent ten years for each mutualistic environment. The results are as follows: scenario, the deviation s of simulation are minimized. It indicates that evolution of China products follows the pattern of developing critical path products (697 -m en X  X  trousers , 700 -women X  X  coats &amp; jackets , 703 -skirts) and the top three competitive products (143 -raw silk, 751 -plastic ornaments, 771 -umbrellas &amp; canes) rather than core products ( 742 -spectacles , 744 -clo cks , 755 -toys ) , which to some extent indicates that the transmission of comparative advantage centered on the competitive products and critical path products, and the evolution of China X  X  competitive products will be convergent to the level of approximate 275.
 In the case of India, we find that the pattern surrounding with critical path products have destructive impact on evolution of India X  s products in which the number of competitive products r apidly decreased from 160 to 25, which means that clothing is not a suitable mutualistic environment for India to transfer comparative advantage to entire product space. The other two evolution patterns are relatively approximate to the actual situation, in which the pattern of developing top three competitive pr oducts ( 237 -castor oil, 405 -jute woven fabrics, 427 -kelem, schumacks &amp; karamanie ) will be convergent to the level of approximate 240 in 2020.
 With the rapid appreciation of yen in 1985 -1986, Japanese companies were adversely affected, which led to the loss of export competitiveness. In above given three mutualistic environment, the evolution pattern of developing critical path products (697 -men X  X  trousers , 700 -women X  X  coats &amp; jackets , 703 -skirts) maintains the actual economi c level, while the mutualistic environment of competitive products ( 325 -cellulose acetates, 447 -unworked drawn or blown gladd,738 -photographic chemicals ) in fact does not specify the actual condition of evolution, which leads to great deviation. This could be because of the great changes of structure of products during the period from 1984 to 2010.
 For America, the first or the second mutualistic environment is not very suitable for America X  X  actual products pattern and presents the tendency of monotone decrease. It is caused by America economic recession in 1990 -1991, which leads to a rapid decline in American competitive products. In contrast with above mutualistic environment, the evolution pattern of competitive products maintains the actual level at 300, which indicates that the evolution pattern of America mainly revolves round the top three competitive products (41 -umilled buckwheat, millet &amp; other cereals N.E.S, 124 -meals and flours from oil seeds, 535 -internal combustion engines for aircraft) .

To explain the various effect of product mutualistic environment , we analyzed descriptive statistics under three corre sponding scenes . The results show that the stability of selected mutualistic products has key effect on subsequent simulation, that is to say, if the exports of selected products fluctuated remarkably during the period , it will cause the instability of mut ualistic environment and the increase of the deviation. In table 1, it is obvious that the standard deviation of Japan X  X  top three competitive exports is far more than America X  X , which leads to differentiated effect on subsequent simulation .
 Japan Unworked drawn Cellulose acetates Photographic chemicals SD 5.38 3.94 1.41 America Combustion SD 0.93 0.77 1.15 Based on the mutualistic environment for above countries, we focus on the question that which products will best drive a country X  X  subsequent economic development level . Here, we research China X  X  product development as example.
 First, we select ed ten representative products as investment targets and introduce d the impact of interaction. The interaction referred to is promoting effect or inhibition effect caused by a particular product. For example, a region with the ability to breed ducks will pro bably have most suitable conditions to breed chicken, which means that they would have similar farms, skilled feeders and breeding experience. If instead we develop a different product such as telephone, the original resource for ducks may hinder the devel opment of electronic products. To implement the conception of interaction, we constructed the indicators to measure promoting ef fect (PE) and inhibition effect (IE) : W here is the probability that promotes the existence of Secondly, we set thresholds for above indicators via mean and standard deviation. In statistics, the scope within mean plus and minus standard deviation represents large probability events, and beyond the scope represents small probability events. Therefore, we set thresholds as the sum of mean and standard deviation:
Thirdly, we simulated ten situations under various government policy. In the fig 8 , we have some important findings as follow: (i) The short -term effect of investment is generally within five years. The subsequent evolution will maintain relatively stable level. (i i) Each investment will lead the discrepancy of initial level, convergence level . For example, the investment for optical glass leads a temporary significant promotion, however, it s effect will decline rapidly to the level of 290. With respect to the investment for watch es , its effect presents hysteretic and progressive, which promotes the convergence level from 300 to 320. (iii) Some destructive inve stments inhibit the product development. As fi g 8 shows, the investment for watch es , CPUs, tea, cigars, optical glass and coconut oil will bring p ositive effect on the evolution, while the investment for live plants, chemicals, live animals and peat cause negative effect on subsequent development in China. Therefore, it is better to invest valid products tha n invest blindly.

In the future work, we would make statistical inferences and causal analysis to the simulation results to explore the relationship between evolution pattern and selected mutualistic targets. Furthermore, we would combine the findings wit h modified product space to explain the transformation in the evolution.
