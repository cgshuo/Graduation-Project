As the T1FS, the concept of Type-2 Fuzzy Set (T2FS) was introduced by Zadeh (1975a X  X ) as an extension of the concept of an ordinary Fuzzy Set (T1FS).

To apply the Fuzzy Lyapunov Synthesis, we assume the following: to as x 1 and x 2 , respectively. Hence by (6), _ x 1  X  x 2. The states x 1 and x 2 are the only measurable variables. 3. The exact Eqs. (1) X (5) are not necessarily known. t m increases (decreases) _ x 2 increases (decreases). 5. The initial conditions x  X  0  X  X  X  x 1  X  0  X  , x 2  X  0  X  X

We can translate these conditions into the following fuzzy rules: for the stabilizing controller: the following rules: This fuzzy rule-base can be represented as in Table 1 .
It is interesting to note that the fuzzy partitions for x follow elegantly from expression (26). Because _ V  X  x 2  X  x _ x regardless of what comes first, we see that Fuzzy Lyapunov words ( Zadeh, 1996 ; Mendel, 2007 ).

To complete the controller X  X  design, we must model the following the Fuzzy Lyapunov Synthesis. We are applying an extension of 0.1 to most parameters.
 For the implementation of the T2FLS, we are using the Type-2 To implement a T2TMF (Type-2 Triangular Membership Function) represent the end of support. 5. Results loop systems for both, the T1 and the T2FLSs.

The main goal of this paper was to propose a systematic tion problem of a servomechanism with nonlinear backlash.
The proposed design strategy results in two controllers that performance from the Type-1 or Type-2 strategy.

The regulation problem was solved as was predicted, this affirmation is supported with experiments where both the T1 and T2FLC designed by following the Fuzzy Lyapunov Synthesis achieve to solve the regulation problem.
