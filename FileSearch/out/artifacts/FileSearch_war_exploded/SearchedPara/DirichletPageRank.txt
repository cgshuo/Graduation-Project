 PageRank has been kno wn to be a successful algorithm in ranking web sources. In order to avoid the rank sink prob-lem, PageRank assumes that a surfer, being in a page, jumps to a random page with a certain probabilit y. In the stan-dard PageRank algorithm, the jumping probabilities are as-sumed to be the same for all the pages, regardless of the page prop erties. This is not the case in the real world, since presumably a surfer would more likely follo w the out-links of a high-qualit y hub page than follo w the links of a low-qualit y one. In this poster, we prop ose a novel algorithm \Diric h-let PageRank" to address this problem by adapting exible jumping probabilities based on the num ber of out-links in a page. Empirical results on TREC data sho w that our metho d outp erforms the standard PageRank algorithm.

The PageRank algorithm [1] computes the imp ortance scores of web pages through a stochastic irreducible Mark ov transition matrix ~ M whic h is constructed from all hyper-links between web pages. Directly de ning ~ M as the nor-malized adjacency matrix M of the web graph alw ays pro-duces a sparse and reducible matrix, yielding to the \rank sink" problem [1]. To solv e this problem, [1] introduces a uniform matrix U ( U ij = 1 N where N is the num ber of the web pages considered.), and linearly interp olates it with M : ~ M = (1 ) M + U . The intuition is that a web surfer will follo w the out-links of the curren t page with probabilit y 1 and will jump to a random page with probabilit y .
The standard PageRank algorithm uses a xed for ev-ery web page. This may not be the best choice. As stud-ied in HITS algorithm [3], every web page is assigned two qualit y scores: hub and authority . A good hub on a topic is to direct the users to authoritativ e pages on that topic. Thus, presumably a surfer tends to follo w the out-links of a high-qualit y hub page rather than a low-qualit y one. This motiv ates us to think that a dynamic value based on the page prop erties can be a better choice.

Interestingly , we observ e that the format of the interp ola-tion form ula ~ M = (1 ) M + U is very similar to the smo othing metho d in language mo dels for information re-triev al [4]. In these mo dels, a Diric hlet smo othing is pro ved to be more e ectiv e than a xed Jelinek-Mercer smo othing because a Diric hlet smo othing can dynamically adjust the interp olation parameter according to the documen t length. Driv en by this similarit y, we hypothesize that a Diric hlet dynamic setting of interp olation parameter can mo del a PageRank Mark ov matrix more accurately . Unlik e the lan-guage mo del smo othing problem, a web page length does not carry much information in the PageRank matrix, thus we would rather consider the num ber of out-links of a page. A page with more out-links is more likely to be a good hub page than a page with few er ones, thus we assign a lower to this page. This assignmen t assumes a surfer would follo w the out-links of the pages whic h are better poten tial hub pages and thus could mo del its beha viors more accurately .
In the surfer mo del, we would like to estimate the proba-bilit y that a surfer will visit a page in the next step, either through the out-links of the curren t page or randomly jump-ing. Giv en a collection of N web pages, assume that A is the adjacency matrix of the corresp onding web graph and that L p denotes all the out-links con tained in the page p . Also assume that a surfer selects the next page using a multi-nomial distribution with parameter p and that L p is the observ ed data. We can nd the maxim um likeliho od esti-mator by normalizing the corresp onding row in A to sum to 1 (The obtained matrix is the same as M above). However, the maxim um likeliho od estimator is not accurate because the unseen links will get zero probabilities. To estimate the surfer mo del more accurately , we use a Diric hlet prior on with hyperparameter = ( 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; N ), given by where C ( ) is the normalization factor. The parameters i are chosen to be i = P rand where is a parameter and P rand = 1 N is the uniform jumping probabilit y. The Bayesian estimate of the probabilit y that a surfer will select link l after page p is where the posterior probabilit y is given by and so is also Diric hlet, with parameters i = c ( l; L p P rand where c ( l; L p ) is the num ber of times link l app ears in L p . Using the fact that the Diric hlet mean is i will have: where P ml is the maxim um likeliho od estimator and ! p = the row corresp onding to page p in A . In a Mark ov transition matrix form, we have ~
M = diag f 1 ! 1 ; :::; 1 ! N g M + diag f ! 1 ; :::; ! N The PageRank values can be calculated by solving the eigen-vector equation: The i-th value in the vector v is the PageRank score of the i-th web page. Since we use Diric hlet prior to calculate the PageRank values, we call our algorithm \Diric hlet PageR-ank". From the de nition of ! p , we can see that the larger the j L p j is, the larger 1 ! p will be. Thus in Diric hlet PageR-ank, a surfer would more likely follo w the out-links of the curren t page if the page has man y out-links, assuming that it is a poten tial good hub page. Since the ma jor computation is used to calculate the eigen vector v , the time complexit y of Diric hlet PageRank is the same as the standard PageRank.
In this section, we compare the prop osed Diric hlet PageR-ank algorithm with the standard PageRank as well as the text-only baseline.

As our data set, we used the \.GO V" test collection, whic h is an 18 gigab yte, 1 : 25 million documen ts 2002 partial crawl of the .gov domain used in TREC-2002 and TREC-2003 ex-perimen ts for topic distillation. The queries for the \.GO V" data are fty \topic distillation" topics created by NIST for TREC-2003 task with 10 : 32 relev ant documen ts on average.
In our exp erimen ts, We used both the non-in terp olated average precision (AvgPrec) and precision at 10 documen ts ( P @10) as our evaluation metrics. We used the text-based Okapi retriev al metho d and the BM2500 weigh ting function as our baseline. The best parameters of the Okapi are set the same as pap er [2], i.e. k 1 = 4 : 2 ; k 3 = 1000 ; b = 0 : 8. To test the e ectiv eness of di eren t PageRanks, we chose the top 2000 documen ts according to Okapi scores and constructed two rankings of the documen ts: the ranking based on the Okapi scores and the PageRank ranking. The nal ranking is obtained by com bining these two rankings in a way similar to the one used in [2]: Figure 1: Performance comparison along with We then rerank the 2000 documen ts according to the com-bined scores and select the top 1000 documen ts for evalua-tion. Apparen tly, the parameter has impact on the per-formance. We vary in the exp erimen ts and select the best results for comparison.

In Table 1, the best text-based result, the best PageR-ank result and the best Diric hlet PageRank result are listed. Both AvgPrec and P @10 are rep orted and compared. From the table, we can see that both PageRank algorithms im-pro ve the performance over the text-based metho d signi -can tly. Furthermore, the Diric hlet PageRank achiev es better performance than the standard PageRank on both AvgPrec (4 : 03% impro vemen t) and P @10 (5 : 55% impro vemen t). The Wilco xon signed rank test indicates the AvgPrec impro ve-men t of Diric hlet PageRank over standard PageRank is sta-tistically signi can t (p-v alue=0.034). This con rms that dif-feren tiating the pages with di eren t num ber of out-links has the poten tial to emphasize the role of good hub pages. Note that our baseline result is not the same as the baseline in pap er [2] because we use all the documen ts in \.GO V" data set while pap er [2] only uses the documen ts with text/h tml format.

We also study the performance under di eren t parame-ter settings. The results are displa yed in Figure 1. In Fig-ure 1(a), the average precision is plotted along with di eren t values. Diric hlet PageRank achiev es the best result when = 0 : 96 and = 20. The standard PageRank achiev es the best result when = 0 : 98 and = 0 : 1. Figure 1(b) dis-plays the comparison based on P @10. As can be seen from the gures, overall, the Diric hlet PageRank outp erforms the standard PageRank.
In this poster, we introduce Diric hlet PageRank to mak e the jumping probabilit y dynamically adapting the num ber of out-links of a page. Compared to the standard PageRank algorithm, the new algorithm favors follo wing the out-links of poten tial good hub pages. Our exp erimen ts on the TREC data set con rms the e ectiv eness of Diric hlet PageRank.
