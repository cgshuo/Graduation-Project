 I came into the KDD area in late 1990s. From my point of view, an important event of Chinese KDD development was the 3 PAKDD conference, which was held in Beijing in April 1999. That was the first internatio nal conference on KDD held in China, and it helped to form the Chinese KDD community. Later, in 2007 the 11 th PAKDD conference was held in Nanjing, for which I was the program chair. The PAKDD 2007 conference attracted more than 730 submissions and more th an 270 attendees from China as well as other Asia -Pacific countries/regions; I think this is a good sign of the growth of the Chinese KDD community. Another important event is the CCDM (China Conference on Data Mining) conference held in Yantai in August 2 009. This is a biennial conference, sponsored by the Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition Technical Committee of the China Computer Federation (CCF), and the Machine Learning Technical Committee of the China Association of Artificial Intelligenc e (CAAI); fortunately I served as the general co -chair. The origin of the conference was two editions of China Conference on Classification Technology and Application (CCTA), held in 2005 and 2007, in Beijing and Zhengzhou, respectively. With the growth of the Chinese data mining community, and the lack of a domestic data mining conference, the CCTA conference changed to CCDM from 2009, while in 2011 the CCDM conference was held in Guangzhou, attracting about 150 attendees. I think the IEEE ICDM 2006 confer ence held in Hong Kong is also a milestone, which greatly promoted the communication of China and international KDD community. I believe KDD 2012 will definitely become a milestone. My research grou p, LAMDA (abbreviation of  X  X earning And Mining from DatA X ) at Nanjing University, mainly works in the areas of machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. Our research spans over theory, algorithm as well as application aspects. For theory and algorithm aspects, we have some work on ensemble methods, semi -supervised and active learning, multi -instance and multi -label learning, cost -sensitive and class -imbalance learning, metric learning and dimensionality reduction, and s tructure learning and clustering; for application aspects, we have worked on image retrieval, computer -aided medical diagnosis, bioinformatics, software mining, etc. We have also worked on theoretical foundations of evolutionary computation. More informati on on our research can be found at http://lamda.nju.edu.cn I believe that KDD will become a fundamental field of computer science, an d all applications of computing technologies will involve KDD in some sense in the future, since  X  X ata X  is more and more crucial and important for all disciplines and domains. I believe both the China and international KDD community will grow greatly in th e coming decade. I also think that more and more branches or sub -branches of KDD will be established, providing more chances for researchers and practitioners. Particularly, China may be able to provide important chances for KDD development since China has potentially the largest online user population and social network in the world. Many companies in China are accumulating or have already accumulated invaluable large data sources, and KDD results may help to promote the growth of the e -commerce market of China, which again is potentially the largest in the world.
