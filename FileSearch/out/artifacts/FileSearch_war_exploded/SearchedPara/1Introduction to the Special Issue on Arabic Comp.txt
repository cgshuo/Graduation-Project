 Guest Editors In recent years there has been a significant increase in the amount of research on the computational analysis of the Arabic language being carried out around the world. This includes both a steady growth of the computational linguistics research commu-nity in the Arab-speaking world, as evidenced by the emergence of scientific societies such as the Egyptian Society for Language Engineering 1 , as well as the existence of major initiatives on Arabic natural language processing (NLP) in Europe and North America (particularly in the United States by the DARPA-funded GALE program 2 ). In addition, the past year alone saw the publication of two monographs on Arabic Com-putational Linguistics [Farghaly 2010; Habash 2010], a special issue of this journal [Shaalan and Farghaly 2009], a new release by the Linguistics Data Consortium of the Arabic Treebank [Maamouri et al. 2009] (among other Arabic-language resources), as well as a number of conferences and workshops on Arabic NLP around the world.
At the 2010 Georgetown University Roundtable on Language 3 (GURT), whose theme was Arabic Language and Linguistics , linguists from around the world and from a wide range of different linguistic traditions and sub-disciplines came together in Washington, D.C. to share their research on the Arabic language. A two-day special session dedicated to Arabic computational linguistics and a half-day preconference tutorial on Arabic NLP drew researchers from both academia and industry. The presentations in the special session spanned the range from applied NLP to natural language understanding, from automatic diacritization to speech act classification, providing attendees with a snapshot of the current state of Arabic NLP. The papers in this volume were selected from those presentations to represent the different approaches and techniques currently being used in the field of Arabic computational linguistics.

Arabic NLP research faces a number of well-known challenges, due to both the morphological complexity of the Arabic language and to the particularities of Arabic orthography. These challenges have been addressed extensively in Arabic NLP research which has focused on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) [Habash and Rambow 2005; Diab et al. 2007; Larkey et al. 2007; Buckwalter 2007; Dichy and Farghaly 2007]. Significant recent attention, however, has been paid to the problems for NLP posed by the diglossic situation of the Arabic-speaking world [Ferguson 1959]. MSA is the language of education and the only standard written variety of Arabic, but it has no native speakers and differs significantly from the natively-spoken dialectal varieties of Arabic X  X raqi, Egyptian, Moroccan, etc. X  X t all levels of linguistic rep-resentation: morphologically, phonologically, lexically, and syntactically. With the ubiquity of the Web, Arabic dialects are emerging as languages of written commu-nication, particularly in social media. While the Arabic NLP community has access to significant resources such as lexicons and corpora for MSA, which have led to the development of robust NLP systems for MSA, processing of dialectal Arabic, with its significant variation from MSA, lack of orthographic standards, and the scarcity of consistently represented text, adds a daunting layer of complexity to the NLP problem.

Heeding the importance of the dialects for Arabic NLP, we selected two articles in this volume that concern themselves with processing of dialectal Arabic, specifically fo-cusing on Iraqi Arabic as a case study. Condon et al., in  X  X achine Translation Errors: English and Iraqi Arabic, X  evaluates machine translation (MT) errors in English-Iraqi Arabic MT systems, while Rytting et al., in X  X pelling Correction for Dialectal Arabic Dictionary Lookup, X  present a system for correcting misspellings made by second lan-guage learners of Iraqi Arabic.

Focusing on four MT systems recently developed for English and Iraqi Arabic under the DARPA TRANSTAC program [Weiss et al. 2008], Condon et al. evaluate quantita-tively and qualitatively the variety of errors that these systems make. This evaluation is based on a novel error rate scoring system (HTER), which, through extensive hand-annotation of the translated text, allows for an analysis of the difficulties endemic to the MT process. They find the major sources of errors to be grammatical distinctions between the languages. For example, well known pronouns and copular verbs are obligatory in English but may be omitted in Iraqi Arabic, and indeed, one third to a half of all Iraqi Arabic to English errors made by the MT systems involve pronouns or copular verbs. An additional result of Condon et al. X  X  study is that although the systems produce on average between one and two errors per utterance, the translation errors made rarely result in significant meaning change.

Rytting et al. present a linguistically sophisticated system for correcting mis-spellings made by second language learners of Iraqi Arabic, addressing the significant challenges that are faced by researchers building spelling-correction systems for di-alectal Arabic in general and for second language learners in particular. Some of these issues are related to the difficulty of orthographic correction for Arabic in general. As Rytting et al. point out, the orthographic density of the Arabic lexicon is very high (five times that of English), which makes the task of choosing the right orthographic form for a misspelled word extremely difficult. Other issues are posed by the dialectal situation specifically and are further compounded by the second-language acquisition environment. Each of the potential sources of observed spelling errors is described, as well as how they are modeled using finite state technology. The finite state method-ology used makes the approach easily extensible to other dialects, itself an important goal for applied Arabic NLP research.
 A volume such as this would not be complete without the inclusion of work on MSA, and in particular on state-of-the art enabling technologies for this variety of the language. Research on MSA has achieved performance comparable to that shown for other languages on segmentation and part of speech (POS) tagging tasks, with widely used systems such as AMIRA [Diab et al. 2007] and MADA [Roth et al. 2008]. Current performance for segmentation is at the 99.2% level and ranges from 85% to 97.4% for POS tagging (depending on the tag set). These results seem to indicate that there is still room for improvement. Moreover it has been noted that Arabic syntactic parsing constitutes a serious bottleneck for higher order processing of Arabic due to several factors including high levels of attachment ambiguity, verbal ellipsis, pro-drop phenomena, and the underspecification of vocalic structure compounded by the relative free word order. Accordingly, we selected an article in this volume that addresses state of the art enabling technologies for MSA hitting on the three areas: morphological segmentation, POS tagging and syntactic parsing. In Kulick X  X  article,  X  X xploiting Separation of Closed-Class Categories for Arabic Tokenization and Part-of-Speech Tagging, X  the author presents a hybrid system that takes advantage of a morphological analyzer (similar to the MADA system) and couples it with a set of hand-crafted rules and patterns gleaned from the corpus. The results are comparable to both the MADA and AMIRA systems. Taking the further step of evaluating the impact of his segmentation and POS tagging system on syntactic parsing, the author successfully shows state-of-the-art results.

Arabic NLP researchers have, of course, addressed higher-level challenges as well, facing similar difficulties as NLP researchers working on other languages do, although sometimes being able to use techniques particular to Arabic, due to its rich morpho-logical make-up. Systems for resolving anaphoric reference have faced the problem of identifying non-referential (or pleonastic) uses of pronouns to exclude from analysis, and typically included a module for carrying out this task [Lappin and Leass 1994; Evans 2001; Li et al. 2009]. In  X  X utomatic Detection of Arabic Non-Anaphoric Pro-nouns for Improving Anaphora Resolution, X  Abdul-Mageed addresses the problem of automatically identifying non-anaphoric pronominal elements for Arabic. He surveys the wide range of non-anaphoric pronouns in MSA, but notes, after carrying out a small-scale annotation task, that only the -hu form appears to be widely used in Arabic texts. Using an example-based machine learning methodology he achieves impressive state-of-the-art results.

This volume contributes to the growing body of research on Arabic NLP, and we hope it provides researchers, both in Arabic NLP and beyond, with insight into the challenges of Arabic linguistics as well as NLP research in general.
