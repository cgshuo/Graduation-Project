 Personality is a critical factor which influences people X  X  behavior and interests. There is a high potential that incorporating users X  characteristics into recommender systems could enhance recommendation quality and user experience. The goal of this tutorial is to give an overview of personality-based recommender systems and discuss challenges and possible research directions in this topic. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  Information filtering ; H.1.2 [ Models and Principles ]: User/Machine Systems  X  human information processing Algorithms, Experimentation, Performance, Human Factors Personality-based recommender system Over the last 20 decade, recommender systems have obtained great success as an intelligent information system to help deal with the information overload probl em, especially in the field of e-commerce [1]. Prior studies on recommender systems mainly consider leveraging user preferen ce information (e.g., user ratings, demographic information (e.g ., gender) [1]. For example, collaborative filtering approaches fi rst build a model from a user's past behavior (e.g., items previously purchased and/or ratings given to those items), then use that model to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in by considering the opinions of other like-minded users. Content-characteristics of an item to recommend items with similar properties. In recent years, other information (e.g., contexts, tags and social information) has also taken into account in the implementation of recommender system [5]. However, few studies have considered addr essing the recommendation problem from the angel of users X  psychological characteristics. Personality can be defined as a se t of characteristics possessed by cognitions, emotions, motivations , and behaviors in various situations. That is, pe rsonality is a critical factor which influences how people make their decisions. People with similar personality characteristics are more likely to have similar interests and preferences. For example, extraverted people usually like the music genre with positive emotions [4]. The effect of personality has on human behavior has been widely studied in psychology, marketing and behavioral economics. Personality could help us explain why we prefer one option to the other. It is implied that incorporating personality into recommender systems could help understand the reasons that essentially determine user preferences. Currently, some researchers have considered inco rporating personality aspects into recommender systems to pers onalize recommendations and enhance both recommendation quality and user experience [2, 3]. Furthermore, it could be noticed that commercial recommenders have been starting to implement personality-based recommendation engines in thei r systems. The successful applications of personality-based recommendation technologies include social matching systems (e .g., online dating systems), gift recommenders, music recommenders and movie recommenders. It is an emerging research field. There are still many challenges, which have not been addressed yet. This tutorial will help catch more attentions on this topic from both academia and industry and form a platform for their discussion and cooperation. This tutorial will give an overview of personality-based recommender systems (PBRS) covering theories and practices, as well as discuss challenges and po ssible solutions in implementing personality-based recommender systems. in psychology, human decision making and affective computing. In particular, the tutorial will pr esent in detail personality theory as well as how exactly personality data look like, how to extract them, how to represent them and how to standardize those definitions to be used as i nput recommender data towards to improve recommendations. Next, the tutorial will present the state-of-the-art technologies and applications of personality-based recommender systems and show the examples of existing tools and systems through live demos. Furthermore, user experience issues in personality-based recommender systems will be discussed by showing the results of real user experiments. The tutorial will conclude with a discussion of challenges in research and practice and an ou tline of research directions. The detailed outline of this tu torial is given as follows. 1. Basic Theories and Knowledge 2. Personality-based Recommender Systems Maria Augusta S. N. Nunes: in 2008 she finished her PhD in France, her thesis [3] was the starting point to the Personality-based Recommender Systems (as described in many papers published in 2011 at ACM, IEEE, UMUAI). (Available as a book http://professores.dcomp.ufs.br /~gutanunes/hp/publications/Tese. zip. Since her PhD her research focus are Affective Computing and how to model and represent the Human Psychological aspects, mainly personality, in computers aiming improve the personalization of information, products and services for humans during their interaction in e-commerce environment, for instance. From 2009 she is an associate professor and researcher at (http://professores.dcomp.ufs.br/~ gutanunes/). Her more recent projects include how to extract and store human Personality in order to motivate and personalize services in Recommender System considering mainly the user Psychological aspects. In the last years she has been writing many books, book chapters and papers about the use of Affectiv e Computing in order to motivate and personalize information for people. In 2011 we received 3 awards in projects which considering aspects such as accessibility, Recommendation and Personality Traits. Curriculum available at (http://lattes.cnpq.br/9923270028346687 ). The Personality Portal with her research is available at (http://www.personalityresearch.com.br/). Rong Hu : She obtained her PhD from the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) group at  X col e Polytechnique F X d X rale de Lausanne (EPFL) in 2012. Her res earch interests concentrate on how to incorporate psychological factors (in particular, personality) into recommender systems to improve recommendation quality and user experience. She has published many papers related to personality-based recommender systems at top-tier international conferences, such as IUI, RecSys and UMAP. She is working as a post-doc in the HCI group at EPFL since March 2012. [1] Adomavicius, G. and Tuzhilin, A. 2005. Toward the Next [2] Hu, R. and Pu, P. 2010.
