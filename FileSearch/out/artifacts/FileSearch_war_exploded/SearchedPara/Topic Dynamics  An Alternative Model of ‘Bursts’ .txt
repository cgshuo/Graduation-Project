 For some time there has been increasing interest in the prob-lem of monitoring the occurrence of topics in a stream of events, such as a stream of news articles. This has led to different models of bursts in these streams, i.e., periods of elevated occurrence of events. Today there are several burst definitions and detection algorithms, and their differences can produce very different results in topic streams. These definitions also share a fundamental problem: they define bursts in terms of an arrival rate. This approach is limiting; other stream dimensions can matter.

We reconsider the idea of bursts from the standpoint of a simple kind of physics. Instead of focusing on arrival rates, we reconstruct bursts as a dynamic phenomenon, using ki-netics concepts from physics  X  mass and velocity  X  and derive momentum, acceleration, and force from these. We refer to the result as topic dynamics , permitting a hierar-chical, expressive model of bursts as intervals of increasing momentum. As a sample application, we present a topic dy-namics model for the large PubMed/MEDLINE database of biomedical publications, using the MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) topic hierarchy. We show our model is able to de-tect bursts for MeSH terms accurately as well as efficiently.

With the ever-increasing volume of technical publications it is increasingly challenging to stay up-to-date with trends in many fields. Furthermore hot topics or shifts in trends are often manifested in  X  X ursts X  of publications, and these are difficult to stay on top of. It is natural to hope that we might be able to better manage some parts of this continu-ing challenge by automating the identification of new trends, and the detection and tracking of topic bursts. There has been a great deal of research into methods for identifying and tracking topics  X  X n the fly X , such as topic detection and tracking (TDT) [1,12,16,17], modeling the evolution of topic hierarchies over time [15], and automatically adjusting (seg-menting) time partitions to find temporal contexts [11].
In this paper we are concerned with the spread of top-ics over time through scientific publications. Specifically we will focus on the curated, slowly-evolving hierarchy of MeSH terms : a hierarchy of topic keywords integrated with the bioscientific literature indexed by PubMed/MEDLINE (www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh, see Section 4.1). Specifically, we are interested in formalizing the notion of a  X  X urst X  that oc-curs in a topic stream (a stream of topics), and characteriz-ing topic streams in the scientific literature.

In the groundbreaking paper [9], Kleinberg developed a framework for doing this, defining a word burst as an in-crease in the occurrence (arrival rate) of the word in a stream of text, and developing an automaton for tracking an opti-mized estimate of this rate. His subsequent paper on track-ing  X  X eme X  topics in the news [7] ( www.meme-tracker.org ) formulates meme topics as patterns of words, and builds on this model of bursts. Kleinberg X  X  burst model has inspired many subsequent efforts, since his traffic-based burst defini-tion is intuitively appealing. Still, this definition may not always be the most appropriate. This is discussed in more detail below (Section 2.1), but for example, this burst model can require modification because the definition is relative to a single stream, and the arrival rate in the definition can be hard to characterize.More generally, defining bursts only in terms of an arrival rate  X  a one-dimensional model  X  can be limiting, since other dimensions of  X  X ursts X  can mat-ter. For example, for the scientific literature, the arrival rate of events is much slower and more difficult to char-acterize than that of the the news feeds considered in [7]. Other dimensions of bursts can be important also, such as the different dimensions of  X  X mpact X  of the scientific liter-ature reviewed in the next section. Furthermore scientific topics are identified differently, such as by taxonomies or ontologies of topics; in particular the PubMed/MEDLINE database ( www.pubmed.gov ) is indexed by the MeSH topic ontology ( www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh ). Although scientific top-ics in this paper are from MeSH, our methods will work with other ontologies. Existing burst models also have limitations in computationally expensive and vague definitions of burst strength etc. These limitations can be serious for detecting bursts in large biomedical literature databases like PubMed, which contains millions of citations. An alternative model addressing these limitations is needed.

The essence of this paper is to view bursts as intervals of increasing  X  X omentum X . We can allow topics to take dif-ferent attributes  X  such as position, velocity, mass  X  that can have any underlying meaning we like. We can then track changes of sign in velocity, and therefore changes of sign in momentum (mass  X  velocity). This is a simple and very gen-eral notion of burst, and we believe it is useful. The empha-sis on momentum is a stock market view of bursts, and thus also a stock market view of topic streams. Technical stock market analysis [13] focuses heavily on monitoring momen-tum, since it can be a natural measure of human sentiment. Increases in momentum are viewed as bursts of sentiment, and swings in momentum (shifts in its sign) as changes in larger trends. In this paper we highlight advantages of this approach for scientific topics. A market perspective can be appropriate if we view science as a marketplace of ideas.
This approach can offer a number of advantages. An im-mediate advantage is that we can adapt existing machinery for monitoring trends, identifying burst periods, and mea-suring burst strength. This instantly provides many famil-iar tools for analyzing and visualizing patterns, backed by decades of experience.

Other advantages of the momentum model lie in the fol-lowing aspects:
Our experiments on PubMed indicates that this model is a natural and practical way of detecting bursts in scien-tific topic streams, and permits analysis of hierarchical topic structure in bursts.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some limitations of existing burst models, and the advan-tages of a simplified approach in computing burst strength given the specific domain. Section 3 (particularly 3.3) details our Topic Dynamics burst model, and Section 4 analyzes this model with experiments using MeSH topics for PubMed, as well as a reproduction of Kleinberg X  X  thought-provoking ex-periment with VLDB and SIGMOD topics  X  in both cases contrasting the results of the different burst models. We conclude with an assessment of this  X  X omentum X  model of bursts, and with some directions for further work in topic dynamics.
There has been a great deal of research into methods for identifying and tracking topics  X  X n the fly X : topic detection and tracking (TDT) [1, 12, 16, 17], modeling the evolution of topic hierarchies over time [15], and automatically adjusting (segmenting) time partitions to find temporal contexts [11]. B  X  orner et al have also studied specific evolution of hot top-ics [5], diffusion of knowledge among research institutions [3], and patterns of coauthorship [2]. There also has been a con-siderable amount of work on  X  X apping science X  [4, 14], and Cokol and Esteban [6] have developed a site called SciTrends that maps the volume of publications for any given topic, along with events (significant papers), using plots that are reminiscent of stock market charts. Two particularly im-portant models of bursts have been developed by Kleinberg and by Shasha and co-workers, described in the following two sections.
Motivated originally by a problem of representing bursts of email messages, Kleinberg X  X  burst algorithm [9] models bursts with an infinite state automaton in which each state represents a message arrival rate (of a Poisson arrival pro-cess). The higher the state, the smaller the expected time gap between messages.  X  X ord bursts X  can then be defined as having arrival rates defined by the number of messages containing a particular word. Additionally, jumping from a lower state to a higher state has an associated cost, while the cost to drop down from a higher state to a lower state is 0. Formally, these states are determined by optimization:
By finding the optimal sequence of states minimizing the cost of transitions and the cost of differences between real arrival rate and the predicted emission rate, a time series of burst strengths is obtained. The complexity of the algorithm for finding this optimal sequence itself can be high, however; optimizing over the state space can be challenging for large-scale analyses or for online applications.

Kleinberg X  X  recent paper on topic tracking in the news [7] formulates  X  X emes X  as patterns of words, using the model of bursts developed earlier in [9]. A major contribution of the paper is to propose scalable clustering approaches for identifying short distinctive phrases traveling intact through on-line text.
Shasha and co-workers have developed several burst defi-nitions [18, 19] based on hierarchies of fixed-length time in-tervals, motivated originally by a problem of modeling bursts of gamma rays. These wavelet-like hierarchies have intervals of different scale defined by powers of 2, much as Kleinberg X  X  states correspond to arrival rates defined by the powers of a given parameter s . Bursts occur in intervals in which event frequency of occurrence exceeds a given threshold. Formally, bursts are defined in [19] as optimal windows:
We believe these existing definitions can be improved for modeling topic bursts in the scientific literature. With pub-lication databases like PubMed  X  databases of millions of documents that span decades  X  alternative burst definitions appear to be needed. Some specific limitations highlighted by PubMed/MEDLINE include:
In this section we propose an alternative definition of bursts involving  X  X omentum X . Specifically, a burst is a time interval over which the rate of change of momentum is pos-itive. This rate of change has a natural interpretation as a kind of  X  X cceleration X  or  X  X orce X , leading us to an intuitive physical model of bursts.

Instead of defining bursts in terms of arrival rate in a single topic stream, our topic dynamic model adapts basic notions of dynamics from physics and models topic bursts as momentum change of the topic. As defined in physics, momentum is the product of mass and velocity, which is the rate of position change. This model defines mass as the current importance of the topic and position as its intensity (which could reflect arrival rate). Since it is hard to mea-sure the change of momentum from these values directly, we adapt popular stock market trend analysis techniques such as EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and MACD (Mov-ing Average Convergence/Divergence) in our model. These yield established measures of momentum and popular indi-cators of trends in dynamic marketplaces (including market-places of ideas). Since all the trend analysis indicators are computable in an online fashion, our model can be very effi-cient, avoiding implementation complexity of existing burst models. The topic dynamic model also leads to a clear defi-nition of burst strength as the MACD histogram value. This benefits not only detection of bursts, but also momentum-based prediction of bursts. A hierarchical topic structure is naturally integrated into the model, so that bursts are accumulated along the hierarchical structure. This allows exploration of semantic information involving multiple top-ics. We show the detailed description and analysis of our topic dynamics model in the following sections.
One problem with  X  X ursts X  in general is that they can be viewed in very different ways, and formal definitions can rest on vague intuition. We try to reconstruct basic ideas about bursts using intuition about  X  X omentum X ; an interval in which momentum is increasing is called a  X  X urst X .
A topic in the scientific literature can have many useful quantitative statistics. As the most basic constructs here, we assume that each topic appearing in the stream has two associated quantities: In general m ( t ) and x ( t ) may be defined only at discrete points in time, and (as will be shown shortly) aggregations of m ( t ) and x ( t ) may use weightings that emphasize recent points in time, but these provide two dimensions for charac-terizing bursts. Constant weights (even m ( t ) = 1) are often enough, but m ( t ) can also be a function of time.
A velocity v ( t ) may be obtainable simply by computing dx ( t ) /dt in general, but here we have discrete events and thus will estimate v ( t ) '  X  x ( t ) /  X  t . Taking this a step further, we can adapt basic notions of dynamics (kinetics, Newtonian mechanics) from physics to fit with these two basic constructs:
Of these measures, momentum is perhaps the most basic  X  m ( t )  X  v ( t ) or equivalently the rate of change of the product x ( t )  X  m ( t )  X  a measure of change in  X  X mpact X . In any mar-ketplace of ideas (whether the stock market or the scientific literature), change in impact is important. For stocks, x ( t ) can be a measure of  X  X alue X  like stock price or P/E ratio. and m ( t ) can be a measure of market  X  X mportance X , such as trading volume or market capitalization (share price times number of outstanding shares). This market perspective can work well for topics, especially when  X  X otal communica-tion volume X  of the topic matches the idea of its  X  X mpact X . This perspective has yielded interesting results in the past for the scientific literature. For example, Cokol and Este-ban [6] built a system called SciTrends ( www.scitrends.com ) that permits visualization of science publication trends using charts that are highly reminiscent of the stock market.
With the physical notions just defined, we can model a burst in terms of momentum, (or equivalently, if not weighted, in terms of intervals of positive acceleration ). Specifically, a burst is a time interval over which acceleration is positive. If we are looking at a value like position x ( t ), in other words, a burst is an interval where v ( t ) = dx ( t ) /dt is increasing, or equivalently, dv ( t ) /dt is positive. Thus, a burst is a period of positive acceleration; and if weighted by mass, a burst is an interval of positive force.

This leads us to a general model of topic dynamics . As a result, momentum is strictly increasing over any burst in-terval. We define a burst as a time interval of maximal length over which the rate of change of momentum is posi-tive. These definitions can go beyond measuring the length and strength of the increased frequency of a particular event, word or topic in a single independent stream. The discrete time values used here and noise in the values of x ( t ) can make it hard to define quantities like dx ( t ) /dt . In this case we need to use some method for making the derivatives meaningful. The MACD indicator described in the next sec-tion give a classical means for finding  X  X rends X  in noisy time series, and specifically trends related to momentum and ac-celeration.
We first review some basic estimators of momentum drawn from technical analysis of stocks. Certainly care is needed in adapting tools for stock market analysis to the analysis of momentum in scientific topics. However, there are many sophisticated tools for estimating momentum.

In the stock market, because of the noisiness of values of x ( t ) like  X  X rice X , some smoothing mechanism is often used to permit analysis. A traditional scheme for identifying trends in stock market analysis is to use moving averages to smooth out noise, and then estimate derivatives (rates of change, hence trends) using differences of smoothed values (moving averages) that have been computed in mildly different ways. We reproduce basic concepts here (for more see e.g., [13]).
Weighted versions of the EMA and MACD indicators are common, replacing the values  X  by an explicit set of weights:
WMACD ( p,q )[ w,x ] t = WEMA p [ w,x ] t  X  WEMA q [ w,x ] For example, the weights w can be the mass values m ( t ), and the weighted signal is momentum relative to these. In our physical terminology, the MACD histogram measures accel-eration or force . As momentum is measured with velocity v ( t ) (or mass times velocity, m ( t )  X  v ( t )), changes in mo-mentum are measured with acceleration a ( t ) = dv ( t ) /dt (or mass times acceleration m ( t )  X  a ( t )). The MACD histogram is therefore a measure of acceleration, and the WMACD his-togram a measure of force. Zeroes of the histogram de-marcate changes in the sign of momentum, and changes in trends.

Prop 1. The MACD , the MACD signal, the MACD his-togram and their weighted counterparts are all linear func-tions of a time series, in the sense that each maps a time series x = { x t | t = 0 , 1 ,..., } to a time series y = f ( x ) defined by a linear combination This linearity follows from the fact that the EMA is linear in this sense, and the difference of two such linear combinations is also a linear combination.
 For example, if  X  n = 2 / ( n + 1) as indicated above,
MACD histogram(4,8,5) = (1  X   X  5 ) (  X  4  X   X  8 ) x t
This formula highlights several important aspects of our burst model. At a fundamental level, we are defining bursts as a kind of linear filter . Beyond the usefulness of technical analysis for identifying trends and bursts in noisy market data, defining bursts in terms of a family of well-understood pattern detectors (linear filters) can bring many analytical tools for data mining.

Furthermore, our burst model is parametric, and the pa-rameters can be tuned to the application. We do not discuss the problem of learning here, but we can train our burst model to match a set of burst examples with an optimized search through the EMA / MACD parameter space. It can be advantageous to have a vector space of burst models de-fined by parameters of this kind, since it permits definition of bursts in a problem-specific fashion.

Prop 2. Given two MACD histogram models ( p,q,r ) and ( s,t,u ) , the symbolic form of their difference P n k =0 specifies intervals on which their burst models differ: se-quences x for which the difference is nonzero define patterns for which the two models yield different burst windows. That is, we can compare burst models qualitatively by ana-lyzing their linear form. For example, in some situations we have used a (7 , 9 , 5) instead of a (4 , 8 , 5) MACD histogram. Consider their difference for a sequence x :
MACD histogram(7 , 9 , 5)  X  MACD histogram(4 , 8 , 5) =  X  0 . 0852 x t + 0 . 00195 x t  X  1 + 0 . 0298 x t  X  2 + 0 . 0320 x The difference has only 3 negative terms, and these put par-ticular emphasis on the most recent value x t . Thus the (7 , 9 , 5) histogram value is generally higher than the (4 , 8 , 5) value unless x t is relatively large, and thus it will obtain larger burst windows. Generally the (7 , 9 , 5) histogram pro-file will be smoother, and emphasize history, while (4 , 8 , 5) will emphasize the most recent value.

Finally, momentum of a time series is naturally a linear function, involving weighted averages (with m ( t )) and dif-ferences (with dx ( t ) /dt ). In this paper we use MACD indi-cators, but other linear functions could be used. There are many kinds of moving average, and many different numerical approximations for derivatives. The MACD indicators are well-established tools of technical analysis, and have worked well for us in identifying bursts.
We analyzed our topic dynamic model using PubMed, a biomedical publication database that includes over 19 mil-lion citations, primarily from life science journals. We devel-oped our model using the MeSH hierarchy, which contains more than 50,000 terms arranged in a generalization hierar-chy. We first show the properties of our model on a subhier-archy of MeSH terms, then we analyze the burst detection accuracy of our model on specific terms against historical events to show our model is able to detect bursts accurately. We also compare our method with Kleinberg X  X  burst detec-tion method and we show our method can be more practical for topic bursts detection in biomedical literature.
MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) is a hierarchy of top-ics integrated with PubMed/MEDLINE ( www.nlm.nih.gov/ mesh ). The 2008 version of MeSH contains about 50,000 terms arranged in a generalization hierarchy with the depth histogram as shown in Figure 2. Notice that this term occurs twice in the hierarchy, with parents  X  X nfection X  and  X  X irus Diseases X   X  and different children depending on the context. Thus MeSH is not a tree; it is a directed acyclic graph.
For scientific publications, a natural window width is 1 year. We consider both finer and coarser resolutions below, but they can create problems, including artifactual bursts and over-smoothing. We therefore have aggregated term frequency counts over annual time windows. From each ar-ticle citation in PubMed, we extract n tuples T = ( y,m ) where y is the published year of the citation, m is the MeSH term, and n is the number of MeSH terms associated with the citation. For each MeSH term m , we look up its set A of ancestor MeSH terms to produce | A | new tuples. Next, from all tuples generated from this citation, duplicates are removed using a hash table. Then, for each tuple T = ( y,m ) generated, the frequency count is incremented by 1.
We applied our model on all 50,000 terms in the 19 mil-lion biomedical publication citations. Since our model uses online computation, it finishes in a few minutes. To show our model makes reasonable and accurate burst detections, we checked the detections of bursts for certain terms which are related to known important events. For illustration pur-pose, frequency is normalized with a scale factor to fit into the value range of histogram.

The rule parser flagged the topic  X  X orphine X  during 1965-1975 as a bursty period in which no child topics were bursty. It is interesting to note that the Vietnam War started in 1963 and ended in 1975. One of the periods of interesting bursti-ness in Figure 3 corresponds almost exactly to the Vietnam War. From the frequency plot in Figure 3, we see that to-wards the end of the war, publications on morphine slowed, resulting in a drop of burst strength. (Since frequency counts for 2008 were incomplete, there is also a sharp drop in both frequency and histogram values in 2008.)
During the early 1990s, a flurry of genetic advancements made deeper research on DNA possible. From the start of the Human Genome Project in 1990 to the cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1996, the growth of genetic research generated bursts in DNA-related topics during this period. Trans-Activators and Single-Stranded DNA are two DNA-related topics that were detected by the parent-child-context rule. Trans-activators are diffusible gene products that act on molecules of viral or cellular DNA to regulate the expres-sion of proteins, according to the Online Medical Dictionary ( cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd ). The detected period of interesting burstiness is 1986-2005 with a sharp increase at 1994 as confirmed by Figure 3. This detected bursty time period corresponds with the start of the era of genetic break-throughs. Single-stranded DNA was detected as an interest-ing burst during 1988-1998. In fact, we can see there is an increase in burst strength starting at 1988, and the strength increases sharply at 1993 from Figure 3. The burst periods of both terms start before 1990, indicating more attention has been paid to the DNA-related fields, which may lead to the above-mentioned two projects. The success of the two projects boosted people X  X  interest, resulting in sharp in-creases of publications. Another thing observed is that the trend of the histogram clearly precedes the trend of the fre-quency for both terms, suggesting that the histogram can be useful in predicting oncoming events.

As shown in Figure 3, the period of dramatic increase in burst strength corresponds to the period of increased aware-ness regarding Sexually Transmitted Diseases. For instance, in 1986-1987, the FDA approved the first anti-retroviral drug to treat AIDS [8]. Hence, real world events are consistent with changes in burst strength starting in 1982. The burst reaches its peak after FDA approval.

We further verify our burst detection model with the terms identified as bursty words in [10]. In this work, the top 50 highly frequent and bursty words used in the top 10% most highly cited PNAS publications in 1982 to 2001 were iden-tified. Their most significant burst periods were also listed. We select four terms  X  X ignal Transduction X ,  X  X ucleic Acids X ,  X  X ntibodies X  and  X  X olecular Sequence Data X  from these top 50 words such that their burst periods are all different from each other. We apply our burst detection model and com-pare our detection with their burst periods identified in [10]. The results are shown in Figure 4. As we can see, the detec-tions of our model are all consistent with these pre-identified burst periods. What X  X  more, the peaks of the bursts detected by our model all fall in the pre-identified burst periods. This again confirms that using the MACD histogram can be ef-fective for identifying bursts.
Kleinberg X  X  burst algorithm was reportedly used in [5], in studying bursts of words appearing in articles related to Melanoma. Specifically, it was used to detect bursts of names for genes and proteins using PubMed. We performed a similar analysis for these words using PubMed, and the re-sults are shown in Figure 5. If our method of gathering data is in fact the same as that in [5], then there are significant differences between the  X  X ursts X  detected by the two differ-ent methods. Furthermore, the time series of frequencies of the four gene names shown in Figure 5 seem inconsis-tent with the bursts detected using Kleinberg X  X  algorithm. Admittedly, this algorithm can use much more precise tim-ing information than the annual sampling we used, and the PubMed data gathered for [5] in 2004 may have changed somewhat. Nevertheless, it appears the intervals detected using momentum are different, and we believe that they bet-ter reflect the structure of the word frequency time series.
Kleinberg X  X  model associates an automaton characterized by the arrival rate for each term and identifies bursts for terms with higher arrival rate than those of others in the same stream of text. Thus the model is stream-dependent. Our model, on the contrary, is stream-independent, in that it only utilizes the historical arrival rate of each term and identifies significant changes in the arrival rate as bursts. To illustrate such difference, we ran our model on the terms in the paper titles from the database conferences SIGMOD and VLDB based on the frequencies of the terms, for the years 1975-2001, in the same manner as Kleinberg [9]. Us-ing histogram(4,8,5), we compared the burst intervals for the terms of highest weight from Kleinberg X  X  model with those from our model (due to space restriction, we select only 12 terms). The comparison is shown in Figure 6. No-tice that we show only the highest weight burst intervals from Kleinberg X  X  model but show all burst intervals of these terms from our model. Consequently there are significantly more burst intervals from our model in the table. However, by comparing the intervals over similar years, we observe that the burst intervals from Kleinberg X  X  model are usually long, spanning multiple years, while the burst intervals from our model are relatively short. During these intervals, the arrival rates of these terms are high while the arrival rates of other terms are relatively low. Thus in Kleinberg X  X  model once the arrival rates of  X  X ursty X  terms become relatively high their burst intervals continue, whereas in our model (since it doesn X  X  compare arrival rates between terms) any significant increase detected by the histogram in the arrival rate of any term is reported as a burst.

To summarize, Kleinberg X  X  model identifies bursts in a stream of text mixed with multiple terms, while our model identifies bursts in a stream of only single terms. The two models address different problems. In our MeSH hierarchy setting, we aggregate the frequencies of child topics with their ancestors. Therefore, the ancestors always have much higher arrival rates and thus tend to have bursts according to Kleinberg X  X  model, as it identifies terms with higher arrival rates relative to other terms. Thus we believe our term-independent model is more appropriate for burst detection in the biomedical literature using MeSH terms.

As we discussed before, our burst model has another ad-vantage in that it is parametric, and the parameters can be tuned to the application. To illustrate how different param-eters affects the results, we conducted the same experiments on paper titles from SIGMOD and VLDB, but with differ-ent histogram parameters. As analyzed in Section 3.5, the burst intervals using histogram(7,9,6) are generally larger as well as smoother than that of histogram(4,8,5). We show the experiments in Figure 7 (due to space restriction, we only show the comparison for three terms). Obviously his-togram(7,9,6) reports larger burst intervals.
We presented a Topic Dynamics framework as an alter-native to detection and analysis of bursts. This framework rests on physical intuition, modeling bursts as intervals of increasing momentum, which can be applied to many  X  X rend X  quantities of interest, such as changes of  X  X alue X  in the stock market and changes of  X  X mpact X  in the scientific literature.
Our experiments show the model works well for track-ing topic bursts of MeSH terms in the bioscientific litera-ture, where arrival rates are often non-random. In addition, the momentum-based topic dynamics burst model described here has significant advantages: (1) momentum can be mon-itored online using technical stock market analysis tools like the MACD , and bursts can be detected using MACD his-togram, giving a way to adapt the vast domain of techni-cal analysis to burst analysis; (2) the topic dynamics model provides two dimensions of modeling (position x ( t ) and mass m ( t )), which can be useful in defining burst strength; (3) the MACD formalism permits burst patterns to be represented as linear filters, permitting both qualitative and quantitative analysis of burst patterns.

The topic dynamics framework also has other interest-ing aspects; it not only detects burst periods, and burst strength, but also can be used for forecasting oncoming bursts (just as momentum is used for forecasting in the stock market). Furthermore, this framework embraces hier-archical structure of bursts, and takes into account semantic links between topics that are missed by single-steam anal-ysis. Elsewhere we have analyzed hierarchical structure in bursts, which fits our model well since momentum is natu-rally hierarchical. We believe hierarchical structure deserves greater attention in future work on bursts, as it is a central aspect of existing frameworks for burst analysis. [1] James Allan.
