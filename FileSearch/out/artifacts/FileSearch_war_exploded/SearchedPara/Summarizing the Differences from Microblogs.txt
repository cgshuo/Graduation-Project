 With the rapid growth of social media websites, microblog-ging has become a popular way to spread instant news and events. Due to the dynamic and social nature of microblogs, extracting useful information from microblogs is more chal-lenging than from the traditional news articles. In this paper we study the problem of summarizing the differences from microblogs. Given a collection of microblogs discussing an event/topic, we propose to generate a short summary de-livering the differences among these microblogs, such as the different points of view for a news topic and the changes and evolution of an ongoing event.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Informa-tion Search and Retrieval; I.2.7 [ Artificial Intelligence ]: Natural Language Processing Summarizing differences, Microblogs
Nowadays, microblogs provide a new communication chan-nel for users to share information and report news. Com-pared to regular blogs and traditional media, microblogging spreads first-hand reports on real-life events faster and more widely. For a hot event, thousands even millions of individ-uals join the discussion and express their opinions through popular microblogging web sites such as Twitter. A natural and interesting question is what are the differences among the discussion. In this paper, we explore the problem of generating a short summary of the differences among mi-croblogs.

This problem is related to document summarization which aims to extract sentences from documents to form a brief summary. However, tradition al document summarization usually selects sentences delivering the majority of infor-mation or query-relevant information from the documents, while in our task the differences need to be addressed. Re-cently there are some research works on comparative docu-ment summarization [7, 5] whi ch also try to summarize the differences from news articles. However, all of the existing research focuses on traditional news articles, few attempts have been made to the newly emerging microblogs. Dif-ferent from traditional news reports, microblogs are short noisy text streams and are of the dynamic and social na-tures. In this paper, we propose a framework to generate short summaries capturing the differences from microblogs. The proposed framework consists of three modules: keyword selection, query expansion, and sentence selection. First of all, discriminant keywords are selected via an unsupervised approach which combines document clustering and keyword selection. Then the keywords are used as the original query to perform query expansion, which is important to deal with the unique characteristics of microblogs. Finally, a query-based sentence selection is conducted using a strategy of maximizing the relevances between the selected sentences and the expanded query and at the same time minimizing the redundancy.
In order to find the differences among microblogs, we use weighted feature subset non-negative matrix factorization (WFS-NMF) proposed in [6] to cluster the microblogs in-to different topics and simultaneously extract discriminant keywords for these topics. This is an unsupervised approach to combine data clustering and feature selection. Unlike the keywords selected from co-clustering or latent semantic anal-ysis which usually strongly associate with one cluster, the keywords selected by WFS-NMF are the most representative and discriminant terms among the topics.

Given a term-microblog matrix X ,let G represent the cluster indicator matrix for terms and F be the cluster indi-cator matrix for microblogs. WFS-NMF can be formalized as follows. where W is a diagonal matrix indicating the weights of the terms in X ,and  X  is a parameter. The terms with the highest weights are the most discriminant keywords.
The original query is usually short and vague, to enhance the query expressibility, query expansion is used to replace the original query by a high-quality query. In this paper, we adopt the pseudo relevance feedback methods implemented in the Terrier information retrieval platform [3]. The meth-ods extract informative terms from the top-ranked docu-ments retrieved using the original query and use them for query expansion.

Here we model each microblog m in the corpus C as  X  m , and model each query Q as  X  Q . The expanded query is defined as Q . In a pseudo relevance manner, suppose the few top-ranked microblogs m + by the initial query Q build a relevant model  X  F . We set the new query to be a linear combination of original query Q and relevant model  X  F : where  X  controls the degree of coherence of the new query to the pseudo relevance. The relevance model method ap-proximates  X  F as the query model, and each pseudo relevant microblog is a sample from the query model. Therefore the relevance model method defines term distribution in  X  F as the likelihood of generating terms from the pseudo relevance: where p ( Q | m +) = q  X  Q p ( q | m +).
Once we obtain the expanded query, we perform a query-based sentence selection under the max-relevance and min-redundancy framework [4]. The sentences are selected one by one, and each selected sentence should be highly related to the query and be dissimilar to the other selected sentences so that to remove the redundancy. This problem then be-comes an optimization problem as follows.

Suppose set S represents the set of sentences and we al-ready have V k  X  1 , the selected sentence set with k -1 sen-tences, then the task is to select the k -th sentence from the set { S  X  V k  X  1 } . In the following formula, we see that min-imizing the redundancy and maximizing the relevance can be achieved concordantly [4]. where Sim is the cosine similarity between a pair of sen-tences. The computational complexity of this incremental sentence selection method is O ( | V | X | S | )= O ( km ).
First of all, we select 10 hot topics of world news and tech-nology such as  X  X apanese earthquake and Fukushima nucle-ar disaster X ,  X  X wine flu outbreak X , and  X  X iri for iphone 4s X , etc. For each topic, we collect 1000 tweets which have the most replies and retweets from Twitter. Three human la-belers manually create reference summaries describing the differences of the tweets for each topic. The length of each summary is limited to 250 words.

In the preprocessing, mentions (@somebody) are removed from the vocabulary. Non-English tweets containing less than one English word with more than 2 characters are filtered. Explicit re-tweets, empty tweets, and forbidden tweets are also filtered.
 Figure 1: Comparison of different summarization systems.
We compare our proposed method with the following ex-isting summarization systems: (1) DocSum -one of the most widely used traditional document summarization method-s [1]; (2) CoRank -a method su mmarizing the differences from multilingual news articles [5]; (3) CDS -a compara-tive document summarization proposed in [7]. We compare the human created summaries with the summaries generat-ed by different systems using the ROUGE toolkit (version 1.5.5) [2].
Figure 1 shows the Rouge scores of different systems. From the results, we observe that (1) DocSum achieves the poor-est results since it focuses on delivering the major informa-tion in the tweets and can not handle the requirement of finding differences; (2) CoRank and CDS outperform Doc-Sum because they are designed to extract different themes from documents and the common aspects among the docu-ments are removed; (3) our proposed method achieves the highest scores because we consider the unique characteristic-s of microblogs which are usually short and noisy, and the discriminant keyword selection, query expansion, and the optimization based sentence selection schemes used in our method can effectively address the problem.
