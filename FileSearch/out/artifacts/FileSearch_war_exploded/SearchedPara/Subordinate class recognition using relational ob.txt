 Human categorization is fundamentally hierarchical, wher e categories are organized in tree-like hierarchies. In this organization, higher nodes close to th e root describe inclusive classes (like vehicles), intermediate nodes describe more specific categ ories (like motorcycles), and lower nodes close to the leaves capture fine distinctions between object s (e.g., cross vs. sport motorcycles). Intuitively one could expect such hierarchy to be learnt eit her bottom-up or top-down (or both), but surprisingly, this is not the case. In fact, there is a well defined intermediate level i n the hierarchy, called basic level , which is learnt first [11]. In addition to learning, this lev el is more primary than both more specific and more inclusive levels, in terms of many other psychological, anthropological and linguistic measures.
 The primary role of basic level categories seems related to t he structure of objects in the world. In [13], Tversky &amp; Hemenway promote the hypothesis that the exp lanation lies in the notion of parts. Their experiments show that basic level categories (like ca rs and flowers) are often described as a combination of distinctive parts (e.g., stem and petals), w hich are mostly unique. Higher (super-ordinate and more inclusive) levels are more often describe d by their function (e.g.,  X  X sed for trans-portation X ), while lower (sub-ordinate and more specific) l evels are often described by part properties (e.g., red petals) and other fine details. These points are il lustrated in Fig. 1.
 This computational characterization of human categorizat ion finds parallels in computer vision and machine learning. Specifically, traditional work in patter n recognition focused on discriminating vectors of features, where the features are shared by all obj ects, with different values. If we make the analogy between features and parts, this level of analysis i s appropriate for sub-ordinate categories. In this level different objects share parts but differ in the parts X  values (e.g., red petals vs. yellow
