 The advent of the Social Web has enabled any-one with a smartphone or computer to easily cre-ate and share their ideas, op inions and content with millions of other people around the world. Much of the content being posted and consumed online is video. With billions of phones, tablets and PCs shipping today with built -in cameras and a host of new video -equipped wearables lik e Google Glass on the horizon, the amount of vid-eo on the Internet will only continue to increase .
It has become increasingly difficult for re-searchers to keep up with this deluge of video content, let alone organize or make sense of it. Mining useful kno wledge from video is a critical need that will grow exponentially , in pace wit h the global growth of content. This is particularly important in sentiment analysis ( Cambria et al. , 2013a ; 2013b; 2014 ) , as both service and product reviews are gradually shifting from unimodal to multimodal. We pr esent a method for detecting sentiment polarity in short video clips of a person uttering a sentence. 
We do it using all three modalities: visual, such as facial expression, audio, such as pitch, and textual, the contents of the uttered sentence. While th e visual and the audio modalities pro-vide additional evidence that improves classifica-tion accuracy, we f o und the textual modality to have the greater impact on the result ( Cam bria and Hussain , 2015 ; Cambria et al., 2013c; Poria et al., 2015a; 2015b ) .

In this paper, we propose a novel way for fea-ture extraction from text. Given a training corpus with hand -annotated sentiment polarity labels, following Kim ( 2014 ) , we train a deep convolu-tional neural n etwork (CNN) on it. However, instead of using it as a classifier, as Kim did, we use the values fr om its hidden layer as features for a much more advanced classifier, which gives superior accuracy. Similar ideas have been sug-gested in the context of computer vision for deal-ing with images, but have not been applied in the context of NLP to textual data, and, specifically, for sentiment polarity classification. In this pa per, we present two different methods for dealing with m ultimodal data: fea ture -level fusion and decision -level fusion, each one having its advantages and disadvantages.

We extracted features from the data for each modality independently. I n the case of feature -level fusion, we then concatenate d the obtained fe ature vectors and fe d the resulting long vector into a supervised classifier. In the case of deci-sion -level fusion, we fe d the features of each modality into separate classifiers, and then com-bine d their decisions. Our e xperimental results show that both o f these methods outperform the state of the art by a large margin. W e used a CNN as a trainable feature extractor to extract features from the textual data. U tter-ance s in the original dataset are in Spanish. While usually it is better to work directly with the source language ( Wang et al., 2013 ) , in this work we translated utterance s in to English using Google transla t or . Without the translation into English , 68.56% accuracy was obtained.

The choice of CNN for feature extraction is justified by the following consi d erations: 1. The convolution layers of CNN can be seen 2. As a feature extractor, CNN is automatic and 3. The features it gives are based on a hierarchy 
A drawback of CNN as a classifier is that it finds only a local optimum , since it uses the same back propagation technique as MLP . How-ever, inspired by ideas introduced in the context of computer vision ( Bluche et al., 2013 ) , we, for the first time in the context of NLP, extract the features that CNN builds internally and feed them into a much more advanced classifier. In our experiments, this was SVM, or roughly its multi -kernel version MKL, which is goo d at finding the global optimum. Thus, the properties of CNN and SVM complement each other in such a way that their advantages are combined.
T o form the input for the CNN feature extrac-tor, for each word in the text we built a 306 -dimension al vector by concatenating two parts: 1. Word embeddings . W e used a publicly avail-2. Part of speech . We used 6 basic parts of For each input text, the input vectors for the CNN were a concatenation of three parts: 1. Left padding. Two dummy  X  X ords X  with 2. Text. All 306 -dimensional vectors corre-3. Right padding. Again, at least 2 dummy 
In our experiments , all texts were very short, consisting of one sentence, the longest one being of 65 words. Thus all input vectors were of di-mension 306  X  (2 + 65 + 2) = 21,114.

The CNN we used consisted of 7 layers: 1. I nput layer, of 21,114 neurons. 2. Convolution layer, with a kernel size of 3 3. Max -pool layer with max -pool size of 2. 4. Convolution layer: kernel size of 2 , 10 0 fea-5. Max -pool layer with max -pool size of 2. 6. Fully connected layer of 500 neutrons, 7. Output softmax layer of 2 neurons, by the 
The CNN was trained using a standard back-propagation procedure. The training data for the output layer were the known sentiment polarity labels present in the training corpus for each text.
As features of the give n text, we used the val-ues of the penultimate, fully connected, layer of the CNN . In this way, we used the last output layer of the CNN only for training, but for actual decision -making, we replaced it with much more sophisticated classifiers, namely, with SVM or MKL. Using only CNN as a classifier, 75.50% was obtained which is in fact lower than the re-sult (79.77%) obtained when CNN was used to extract trainable features for the SVM classifier.
We also tried other word vectors having dif-ferent dimensions , e.g. , Glove word vectors and Collobart X  X  word vectors. However , the best ac-curacy was obtained using Google word2vec. We split e ach clip into frames ( still images ) . From each frame, we extracted 68 facial charac-teristic points (FCPs) , such as the position of the left corner of the left eye, etc., using the facial recognition library CLM -Z ( Baltru X aitis et al., 2012 ) . For each pair of FCPs , we calculated the distance. Thus , we characterized each facial ex-pression by 68  X  67 / 2 = 2 , 278 distances. In ad-dition, for each frame we extracted 6 face posi-tion coordinates (3 D -dimen sional displacement and angular displacement of face and head ) using the GAVAM software. This gave 2 , 278 + 6 = 2 , 284 values per frame .

For each of these values, we calculated its mean value and standard deviation over all frames of the clip ; 4568 features in total . We used the openSMILE software ( Eyben et al., 2010 ) to extract audio features related to the pitch and voice intensity. This software extracts the so -called low -level descriptors , such as Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, spectral centroid , spectral flux , beat histogram, beat sum, strongest beat, pause duration, pitch, voice quality, percep-tual linear predictive coefficients, etc . , and their statistical functions, such as amplitude mean, arithmetic mean, root quadratic mean, standard deviation, flatness, skewness, kurtosis, quartiles, inter -quartile ranges, linear regression slope, etc. This gave us 6373 audio features in total. Feature -level fusion consisted in concatenation of the feature vectors obtaine d for each of the three modalities. The resulted vectors and along with the sentiment polarity labels from the tra in-ing set, were used to train a classifier with a mul-tiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithm; we used the SP F -G MKL implementation ( Jain et al., 2012 ) designed to deal with heterogeneous data. Clearly, feature vectors resulted from concatenat-ing so different data sources are heterogeneous.
The parameters of the classifier were found by cross validation . We chose a c onfiguration with 8 kernels: 5 RBF with gamma from 0.01 to 0.05 and 3 polynomial with power s 2, 3, 4. We also tried Simple -MKL ; it gave slightly lower results. We significantly reduced the number of features using feature selection. We used two different feature selectors: one based on the cyclic correla-tion -based feature subset selection (CFS) and another based on principal component analysis (PCA) with top K features , where K was experi-mentally selected and varied for different exper-iment. For example, in case of audio, visual and textual fusion , K was set to 300.

The union of the features selected by the two methods was used. For each unimodal, each bi-modal , and the multimodal experiment, separate feature extraction was performed . T he number of # features, without selection 500 4568 6373  X 
Unimodal
Bimodal Multimodal 305 74 58 74.09% 87.89% 88.60% selected features for each experiment is given in Table 1 . In all cases except for the unimodal ex-periment with audio modality, feature selection slightly improved t he results, in addition to the improvement in processing time. In the only case where feature selection slightly deteriorated the result, the difference was rather small. For unimodal experiments and for de cision -level fusion, we used one classifier per each modality; specifically, we used SVM . For each modality, in this way we obtained the probabilities of the la-bels. In unimodal experiments, we chose the la-bel with the greater probability.

For decision -lev el fusion, we added these probabilities with weights , which were chose n experimentally , and, again, used the most proba-ble label. The weights we used for decision -level fusion were chosen using detailed search with an intuition that best performing unimodal classifier has higher importance in the fusion. We do not claim that these weights are optimal. They are indeed sub -optimal and hence encourage the scope of future research.

Knowing a specific decisio n for the text mo-dality allowed us to use evidence from a separate classifier ; we used the one based on the Sentic P atterns (SP) ( Poria et al., 2014a ) . It structure s natural langua ge cla uses into a sentiment hierar-chy used to infer the overall polarity label (posi-tive vs . negative) for the input sentence. E.g., a sentence  X  X he car is very old but it is rather not expensive X , is positive, expressing a favorable sentiment of the speaker, who recommends pur-chasing the product. However,  X  The car is very old though it is rather not expensive  X  is negative, expressing reluctance of the speaker to purchase the car . Despite the latter contains exactly the sa me concepts as the former, the polarity is op-posite because of the adversative dependency. 
On benchmark datasets, SP perform better than state of the art sentiment classifiers , which outperforms the textual classifier described in Section 3. Since S P are a superior classifier , we used it as a bias to modify the weight of the tex-tual modality. However, S P do not report a prob-ability , but only a binary decision, so we only used them to tweak the weights in the probability mix: when the text -based unimodal c lassifier agreed with SP , we increased the weight of the text modality. Another benefit of the decision -level fusion is its speed, since fewer features are used for each classifier and since SVM, used as a unimodal classifier , is faster than MKL. In addi-tion, separate classifiers can be run in parallel. We report results for tenfold cross -validation. 9.1 Dataset We experimented on the dataset de scribed by Morency et al. ( 2011 ) . The dataset consists of 498 short video fragments where a person utters one sentence. The items are manually tagged for sentiment polarity, which can be positive, nega-tive, or neutral. We discarded the neutral items from the dataset, which gave us a dataset of 447 clips tagged as positive or negative.

The video in the dataset is present in MP4 format with the resolution of 360  X  480, to which the developers converted all videos originally collected in different formats wit h different reso-lution. The duration of the clips is about 5 sec-onds on average. About 80% of the clips present female speakers. The developers provided tran-scription of the text of the sentences, which we used in our textual modality processing. 9.2 Results f or Each Modality Separately As a baseline, we used classifiers trained on fea-tures extracted from each modality separately. The results are shown in Table 1 , unimodal sec-tion . The number of features after feature selec-tion is indicate for the modality used .

The table shows that the best results were ob-tained for textual modality; the visual modality performed worse, and the audio was least useful. However, even the worst of our results is much better than the state -of -the -art ( P X rez -Rosas et al. , 2013 ) . In each modality separately, our re-sults outperform the state of the art by about 9%, which is about 30% reduction in error rate. 9.3 Results with Feature -level Fusion As a yet another baseline, we tried feature -level fusion of only two modalities. 
The results are shown in Table 1, bimodal sec-tion. Again, the number of features after feature selection is indicated for the two modalities used . As expected, missing the audio features was the least important , missing the video features was more significant, and missing the text features was most painful for the accuracy .

E ven the worst result obtained with fusion of two modalities outperformed our best unimodal resu lt , as well as the best result of the state of the art. Finally, the best result, shown in the multi-modal section of Table 1, was obtained when all three modalities were fused. This result outper-forms the corresponding result of the state of the art by 14 %, which gives 56% of error reduction. 9.4 Results with Decision -level Fusion The results for decision -level fusion are shown in Table 2 , last column . The shaded cells are shared with Table 1 . In the second section, three classi-fiers were fused at the decision level. In the third section, two modalities indicated with the plus sign were fused at the feature level ( giving the accuracy indi cated in the penultimate column) and then this classifier was fused at the decision level with the third modality . T he weight s corre-spond to the share of each modality. In the last section, the weight for the unimodal classifier is shown, and the weight for the bimodal classifier was its complement to 1.

For the experiments that involved tweaki ng of the weights with the SP oracle, pairs of we ights are shown: the weight used when the text mo-dality results corresponded (left) with the SP prediction and the weight used when they did not (right) . T he accuracy with at least partial feature -level fusion was better than that for no feature -level fusion at all ( 3 -way). As in the bimodal sec-tion of Table 1, excluding audio from feature -level fusion was least problematic and excluding text was most problematic .

In all cases , decision -level fusion did not sig-nificantly improve the accuracy of the best sum-mand. However, separ ating text -based classifier permitted us to use the Sentic P atterns tweak, which cannot be used if the text -only results are no t known. W ith this tweak, the best result was obtained. Even with this improvement, the accu-racy of decision -level fusion was sli ghtly lower than that of feature -level fusion; in exchange for much about twice better processing speed.

A baseline decision level evaluation strategy was taken which allowed us to take majority vot-ing among the predicted class labels by unimodal classifiers. Based on this strategy the final class label was chosen by the maximum of the three unimodal models X  votes. For the multimodal fu-sion using this baseline method only 72.83% ac-curacy was obtained. As expected the proposed feature and decision l evel fusion outperformed this baseline method by a large margin. We have presented a novel method for determin-ing sentiment polarity in video clips of people speaking. We combine evidence from the words they utter, the facial expression, and the speech sound. The main novelty of this paper consists in using deep CNN to extract features from text and in using MKL to classify the multimodal hetero-geneous fused feature vectors.

We also present ed a faster variant of our method, based on decision -level fusion. In case of the decision level fusion experiment, the cou-pling of Sentic Patterns to determine the weight of textual modality has enriched the performance of multimodal sentiment analysis framework considerably. However, the parameter selection for decision level fusion produced suboptimal results. A systematic mathematical approach for decision level fusion is an important future work.
Our f uture work will focus on extracting more relevant features from the visual modality. W e will employ deep 3D convolutional neural net-works on this modality for feature extraction. We will use a feature selection me thod to obtain key features ; this will ensure the scalability as well as stability of the framework. We will continue our study of reasoning over text ( Jimene z et al., 2015; Pakray et al., 2011 ; Sidorov et al., 2014 ; Sidorov, 2014 ) and in particular of concept -based sentiment analysis ( Poria et al., 2014b ) .
