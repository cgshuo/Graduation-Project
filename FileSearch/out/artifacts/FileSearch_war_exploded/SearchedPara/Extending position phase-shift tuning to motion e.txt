 information about the environment. Although image motion is commonly used, there are different models for image motion processing in different systems. The Reichardt model is a dominant model for motion detection in insect s, where image motion analysis oc curs at a very early stage [1]. motion energy model is one of the dominant models [2][3]. However, despite the differences in complexity between these two models, they are mathematically equivalent given appropriate choices of the spatial an d temporal filters [4].
 The motion energy model is very closely related to the disparity energy model, which has been used to model the outputs of disparity selective ne urons in the visual cortex [5]. The disparity tun-ing of neurons in this model can be adjusted via two mechanisms: a position shift between the cen-ter locations of the receptive fields in the left and right eyes or a phase shift between the receptive field organization in the left and right eyes [6][7] . It appears that biologi cal systems use a combina-tion of these two mechanisms. energy neurons. We combine the Reichardt model and the motion energy mode l to obtain an archi-tecture for constructing motion energy neurons whose tuning can be adjusted by the analogs of phase shifts, inspired by a similar comparison from the disparity energy literature. We show that by simply comparing the outputs of pair of motion en ergy cells with combined position/phase shift tuning enables us to discriminate reliably be tween stimuli moving above and below a reference velocity. Finally, in Section 4, we place this work in th e context of recent resu lts on speed tuning in V1 neurons. Each detector computes the correlation between its photosensor input and the delayed input from the photosensor to the left. The delay could be implemented by a low pass filter. Usually, the corre-lation is assumed to be computed by a multiplication between the current and delayed signals. For consistency with the following discussion, we show the output as a summation followed by a squaring. Squaring the sum is essentially equivalent to the product, since the product could be recovered by subtracting the sum of the squared inputs from the squared sum (e.g. Delbruck proposed a modification of the Reichardt detector (Figure 1(b)), which switches the order of the delay and the sum, resulting in a delay-line architecture [8]. The output of a detector is the sum of its photosensor input and the delayed output of the detector to the left. This recurrent con-nection extends the spatio -temporal receptive field of the detector, since the input from the second-nearest-neighboring photosensor to the left is no w connected to the detector through two delays, whereas the Reichardt detector never sees the output of its second-nearest-neighboring photosen-sor.
 The velocity tuning of these detectors is determined by the combination of the temporal delay and the position shift between the neighboring detector s. As the delay increases, the tuned velocity decreases. As the position shift in creases, the tuned velocity also increases. This position-tuning of velocity is reminiscent of the pos ition-tuning of disparity energy neurons, where the larger the posi-tion shift between the spatial receptiv e fields being combined from th e left and right eyes, the larger the disparity tuning [9].
 Figure 1(c) shows a 1D array of three motion ener gy detectors[2][3]. At each spatial location, the outputs of the photosensors in a neighborhood ar ound each spatial location are combined through even and odd symmetric linear spatial receptive fi elds, which are here modelled by spatial Gabor functions. In 1D, th e even and odd symmetric Gabor receptive field profiles are the real and imagi-nary parts of the function where determines the preferred spatial frequency of the recepti ve field, and determines its spatial extent. The even and odd spatial filter out puts are then combined through temporal filters to produce two outputs which are then squared and summed to produce the motion energy. In many cases, the temporal receptive fiel d profiles are also Gabor functio ns. The combined spatial and tem-poral receptive fields of the tw o neurons are separable when cons idered as a single complex valued function: where and determine the preferred temporal frequency and temporal extent of the temporal velocity at which a moving sine-wave grating stimulus produces maximum response varies with the spatial frequency of the sine-w ave grating. However, since spatia l frequencies of lead to the largest responses, the filter is sometimes thought of as having a preferred velocity ab + () 2 a 2 b 2 + ()  X  2 ab = v One problem with using spatio-temporal Gabor functi ons is that they are n on-causal in time. In this work, we consider the use of a cau sal recurrently implemented temporal filter. If we let the real and imaginary parts of denote the even and odd spatial filter outputs, then the two temporal fil-Figure 1.

(d) The proposed motion detector by combining the position and phase t uning mechanisms of (b) and (c). ter outputs of the temporal filter are given by the real and imaginary parts of , which satis-fies where and are real valued constants. We de rive this equation from Fig. 1(c) by consider-ing the time delay as a unit sample discrete time delay. We consider discrete time operation here for consistency with our experimental results, however, a corresponding continuous time temporal filter can be obtained by replacing the time delay by a first order continuous-time recurrent filter with time constant . The frequency response of this complex-valued filter is where and are spatial and temporal frequenc y variables. This function achieves unity max-imum value at , independentl y of . Assuming the same Ga bor spatial receptive field, the combined spatio-temporal receptive field can be approxima ted by the contin uous function: where is the unit step func tion, and . Again, strictly speaking, the filter is not velocity tuned, but for input sine-wave gratings with a spatial frequency near , the composite spatio-temporal filter has a preferred velocity near .
 The velocity tuning of this filter is determined by the combination of the time delay and a phase shift between the input and the output . The longer the time delay, the slower the preferred velocity. However, the larger the phase-shift, the highe r the preferred velocity. This phase-tuning of velocity is reminiscent of th e phase-tuning of disparity tuned neurons, where the larger the phase shift between the left and righ t receptive fields, the larg er the preferred dispar-ity.
 The possibility to adjust velocity tuning using two complementary mechanisms, suggests that it should be possible to combine these two methods, as observed in disparity neurons. Figure 1(d) shows how the position and phase tuning mechanisms of Figures 1(b) and 1(c) can be combined. The preferred velocity for spatial frequencies will be determined by the sum of the preferred velocities determined by the positio n and phase-shift mechanisms, i.e. , assuming a unit spatial displacemen t between adjacen t photosensors. Given the possibility of combining the position and phase tuning mechanisms, an interesting ques-tion is how these two mechanisms might be exploited when constructing populations of motion energy neurons. Velocity can be estimated using a population of neurons tuned to different spatio-temporal frequencies [10][11]. Ho wever, the output of a single motion energy neuron is an ambigu-motion, (e.g. orientation, contrast).
 Given the long history of position/phase shifts in disparity tuning, it is natural to start with an inspi-ration taken from the context of binocular vision. It has been shown that the responses from a pop-ulation of phase-tuned disparity energy are more comparable than the resp onses from a population of position-tuned disparity energy neurons [12]. In particular, the preferred disparity of the neuron with maximum response in a population of phase tu ned neurons is a more reliable indicator of the stimulus disparity than the pref erred disparity of the neuron with maximum response in a popula-tion of position tuned neurons, especially for neurons with small phase shifts. The disadvantage of purely phase tuned neurons is that their preferred disparities can be tuned only over a limited range due to phase-wraparound in the sinusoidal modula tion of the spatial Gabor. However, there is no restriction on the range of preferred disparities when using position shifts. Thus, it has been sug-rough estimate of the stimulus disparity, and then use a population of neur ons tuned by phase shifts to obtain a more accurate esti mation of the actual disparity.
 In this section, we demonstrate that a similar phenomenon holds for motion energy neurons. In par-ticular, we show that we can use position shifts to place the tuned velocity (for a spatial frequency of ) in a population of two neurons around a desired bias velocity, , and then use phase shifts with equal magnitude but opposite sign to place the preferred velocities symmetrically around this bias velocity. We then show that by comparing the outputs of these two neurons, we can accurately discriminate between velocities above and below . The equation describing the complex valued output of the spatio-temporal filtering stage for the detector shown in Figure 1(d) is The frequency response is and achieves its maximum along the line , as seen in the contour plot of the spatio-temporal frequency response magnitude of the cas cade of (1) and (7) in Fig. 2(a). In comparison, the spatio-temporal frequency response of the cas cade of (1) and (4) shown in Fig. 2(e), achieves its maximum at independently of . For a moving sine wave grating input with spatial and tem-poral frequencies and , the steady state motion energy outputs will be proportional to the squared magnitudes of the spatio-temporal frequency response evaluated at . Assume that we have two such motion cells with the same preferred spatial frequency positive is tuned to fast velocities, while the motion energy cell with negative is tuned to slow velocities. If we compare the freque ncy response magnitudes at frequency , the boundary between the regions in the plane wher e the magnitude of one is larger than the other is a line passing thorough the origin with slope equal to 1, as shown in Fig. 2(c). This suggests that we can determine whether the velocity of the gr ating is faster or slower than 1 pixel per frame by checking the relative magnitude of the motion energy outputs, at least for sine-wave gratings. Although the sine-wave grating is a particularly simple input, this property is not shared by other pairs of motion energy neurons. For example, Fig. 2(f) shows the spatio-temporal frequency responses two motion energy neurons that have the same spatio-temporal center frequencies as con-boundary is a horizontal line. Thus, the velocity boundary depends upon the spatial frequency. For lower spatial frequencies, the relative magnitudes will switch at higher velocities. Another com-monly considered arrangement of Gabor-filters is to place the cen ter frequencies around a circle. For two neurons, this corresponds to displacing th e two center frequencies by an equal amount per-pendicularly to the line (Fig. 2(k)). For mo tion energy filters built from non-causal Gabor filters, the spatio-temporal frequency respon ses exhibit perfect circular symmetry, and the decision boundary also coincides with the diagonal line (see Figure 9 in [13]). However, non-causal filters are not physically realizable. If we consider motion energy neurons constructed from temporally causal functions (e.g. the cas cade (1) and (4)), the boundary only matches the diagonal line in a small neighborhood of , as shown in Fig. 2(i).
 We have characterized the performa nce of the three motion pairs on the fast/slow velocity discrim-ination task for a variety of inputs, including sine -wave gratings, square wa ve gratings, and drifting random dot stimuli with varying coherence.
 We first consider drifting sinusoidal grati ngs with spatial frequencies and veloci-ties . For each spatial frequency and velo city, we compare the two motion energy  X  outputs at different phase shifts of the input gr ating, and calculate the percentage where the response of the fast cell is larger than that of th e slow cell. Fig. 3(a)-(c) sh ow the percentages as the grey scale value for each combination of input spatial frequency and velocity. Ideally, the top half should be white (i.e. the fast cell X  X  response is larger for all inputs whose velocity is greater than tuned velocity bias, the responses are correct over a wide range of spatial frequencies. On the other hand, for the motion pairs with the same center frequencies but tuned by pure phase shifts This is consistent with the horizontal decisi on boundary computed by comparing the frequency response magnitudes. For the pha se-tuned motion-energy cells with orthogona lly displaced center frequencies, the boundary rapidly diverges from the horizontal as the spatial frequency moves away from . Fig. 3(d) shows the over all accuracy by combining the res ponses over all velocities. The detector utilizing the phase-tuned cells with position bias have th e highest accuracy over the widest range of spatial frequencies.
 Fig. 3(e)-(h) show the responses of the motion pairs to square wave gratings. The results are similar to the case of sinusoidal gratings, except that th e performance at low spatial frequencies is worse. Figure 2.

The center frequencies of the fast (a) and slow (b) cells are and respectively. Seco nd row: Vertically displaced phase-tuned motion energy cells.

 Fig. 3(i)-(l) show the responses for drifting random dot stimuli at different velocities and coherence levels. The dots were one pixel wide. The motion pair using the phase-shifted cells with position tuned bias velocity maintain a consistently hi gher accuracy over all coherence levels tested. We described a new architecture for motion energy filters obtained by combining the position tun-ing mechanism of the Reichardt-like detectors and the phase tuning mech anism of motion energy detectors based on complex-valued spatio-temporal separable filters. Motivated by results with dis-parity energy neurons indicating that the responses of phase-tuned neurons with small phase shifts are more comparable, we have examined the abilit y of the proposed velocity detectors to discrimi-nate between input stimuli above and below a fixed velocity. Our experimental and analytical results confirm that comparisons between pairs constructed by using a position shift to center the tuned velocities around the border and using phase sh ifts to offset the tuned velocity of the pair to were based on pure phase tuning.

Recent experimental evidence has cast doubt upon the belief that the motion neurons in V1 and MT have very distinct properties. Traditionally, the tu ning of V1 motion sensitive neurons is thought to be separable along the spatial and temporal frequ ency dimensions, while the frequency tuning MT neurons is inseparable, consistent with constant speed tuning. However, it now seems that both V1 and MT neurons actually show a continuum in the degree to which preferred velocity changes with spatial frequency [14][15][16]. Our proposed neuron s constructed by position and phase shifts also show an intermediate behavior between speed tuning and space-ti me separable tuning. With pure tuned. An intermediate tuning is obtained by co mbining position and phase tuning. Our results on a simple velocity discrimination task suggest a functi onal role for this intermediate level of tuning in creating motion energy pairs whose relative responses truly indicate changes in velocity around a reference level for stimuli with a broad band of spatial frequency content. Pair-wise comparisons have been previously proposed as a potential method for coding image speed [17][18]. Here, we have demonstrated a systematic way of construc ting reliably comparable pairs of neurons using simple neurally plausible circuits.
