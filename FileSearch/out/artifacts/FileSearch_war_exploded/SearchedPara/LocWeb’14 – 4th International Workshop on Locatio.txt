 The LocWeb 2014 workshop continues a successful workshop series at the intersection of geospatial search, information management, and Web architecture with a focus towards location-aware information access . The workshop reflects a multitude of fields that demand and utilize location features, featuring presentations that look at the topic of location on the Web from an interdisciplinary perspective, including new approaches dealing with or utilizing geospatial information.

Location has quickly moved from the next hot thing into being accepted as an important aspect of the Web and, es-pecially, the mobile Web. Its importance is growing even more, as mobile access is surpassing other forms of Web usage and many players adopt a mobile-first strategy. Loca-tion also plays a role in the form of the explicit or implicit location of resources, locations described in content, loca-tion of users, location APIs, or mobile apps, being also used in geospatial-aware data mining or large-scale analytics. It is thus a strong driver behind many recent innovations and research activities.

LocWeb has previously been held at conferences from dif-ferent topics, underlining its multi-disciplinary approach. The workshop series is indexed in the ACM Digital Library 1 .
The first edition, LocWeb2008 2 , was co-located with WWW 2008 in Beijing, China [1]. Its main topic was the extrac-tion and exploitation of location information, towards more explicit spatial knowledge.
 LocWeb2009 3 was held at CHI 2009 in Boston, USA [2]. It dealt with the HCI view towards Web-based geospatial services, including location sharing, location as context, and user interface design and testing.

LocWeb2010 4 was held at IoT  X  Internet of Things 2010 in Tokyo, Japan [3]. It addressed location aspects in multi-sensor devices and  X  X hings X  with ubiquitous connectivity, fo-cusing on Web technology and Web architecture.

Four years latter, LocWeb2014 5 is now being held at CIKM 2014 in Shanghai, China.
The workshop accepted 6 papers for presentation and in-clusion in the proceedings [4].

Liu, Vasardani, and Baldwin present a comparative analy-sis over various geoparsers in the task of identifying locative expressions, benchmarking their performance on informal language commonly found in social networks. They addi-tionally work on corpus construction and error analysis [10]. Li, Kardes, Wang, and Sun report on the use of Hidden Markov Models to parse and segment addresses, aiming to use the results in a similarity function for record linkage [9].
Niu, Matsumoto, Saiki, and Nakamura worked towards the formal definition of data models for indoor positioning, abstracting from different implementations to allow for eas-ier generation of location-based services [11].

Kufer and Henrich take on the issue of representing geo-tagged media collections in peer-to-peer networks, so as to make them searchable. Their hybrid approach optimizes se-lectivity and representation size to support the selection of those peers that potentially carry relevant results [8].
Tytyk and Baldwin consider the automatic selection of appropriate zoom levels in map interfaces, when presented with informal location descriptions. Their classification ap-proach uses multiple features of geospatial descriptions and is evaluated on different levels of noisy data [14].
Chang, Fan, and Chen use a classification approach to un-derstand human movement data, inferring place semantics of visited locations based on temporal patterns associated to the location tracking of participants in their study [7]. We would like to thank all authors of submitted papers and the members of the programme committee for their work in reviewing the contributions. http://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE412 http://medien.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de/ LocWeb2008/ http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/archives/locweb2009/ http://medien.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de/ LocWeb2010/ http://dhere.de/locweb2014/
