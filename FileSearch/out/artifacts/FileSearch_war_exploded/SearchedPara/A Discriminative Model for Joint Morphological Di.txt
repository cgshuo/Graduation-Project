 To date, studies of morphological analysis and dependency parsing have been pursued more or less independently. Morphological taggers dis-ambiguate morphological attributes such as part-of-speech (POS) or case, without taking syntax into account (Hakkani-T  X  ur et al., 2000; Haji  X  c et al., 2001); dependency parsers commonly assume the  X  X ipeline X  approach, relying on morphologi-cal information as part of the input (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007). This approach serves many languages well, especially those with less morphological ambiguity. In English, for ex-ample, accuracy of POS tagging has risen above 97% (Toutanova et al., 2003), and that of depen-dency parsing has reached the low nineties (Nivre et al., 2007). For these languages, there may be little to be gained to justify the computational cost of in-corporating syntactic inference during the morpho-logical tagging task; conversely, it is doubtful that errorful morphological information is a main cause of errors in English dependency parsing.

However, the pipeline approach seems more prob-lematic for morphologically-rich languages with substantial interactions between morphology and syntax (Tsarfaty, 2006). Consider the Latin sen-tence, Una dies omnis potuit praecurrere amantis ,  X  X ne day was able to make up for all the lovers X  1 . As shown in Table 1, the adjective omnis ( X  X ll X ) is am-biguous in number, gender, and case; there are seven valid analyses. From the perspective of a finite-state morphological tagger, the most attractive anal-ysis is arguably the singular nominative, since omnis is immediately followed by the singular verb potuit ( X  X ould X ). Indeed, the baseline tagger used in this study did make this decision. Given its nominative case, the pipeline parser assigned the verb potuit to be its head; the two words form the typical subject-verb relation, agreeing in number.

Unfortunately, as shown in Figure 1, the word om-nis in fact modifies the noun amantis , at the end of the sentence. As a result, despite the distance be-tween them, they must agree in number, gender and case, i.e., both must be plural masculine (or femi-nine) accusative. The pipeline parser, acting on the input that omnis is nominative, naturally did not see this agreement, and therefore did not consider this syntactic relation likely.

Such a dilemma is not uncommon in languages with relatively free word order. On the one hand, it appears difficult to improve morphological tag-ging accuracy on words like omnis without syntactic knowledge; on the other hand, a parser cannot reli-ably disambiguate syntax unless it has accurate mor-phological information, in this example the agree-ment in number, gender, and case.

In this paper we propose to attack this chicken-and-egg problem with a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological and syntactic properties of a sentence, given its words as input. In eval-uations on various highly-inflected languages, the model outperforms both a baseline tagger in mor-phological disambiguation, and a pipeline parser in head selection.

After a description of previous work (  X  2), the joint model (  X  3) will be contrasted with the base-line pipeline model (  X  4). Experimental results (  X  5-6) will then be presented, followed by conclusions and future directions. Since space does not allow a full review of the vast literature on morphological analysis and parsing, we focus only on past research involving joint morpho-logical and syntactic inference (  X  2.1); we then dis-cuss Latin (  X  2.2), a language representative of the challenges that motivated our approach. 2.1 Joint Morphological and Syntactic Most previous work in morphological disambigua-tion, even when applied on morphologically com-plex languages with relatively free word order, such as Turkish (Hakkani-T  X  ur et al., 2000) and Czech (Haji  X  c et al., 2001), did not consider syn-tactic relationships between words. In the litera-ture on data-driven parsing, two recent studies at-tempted joint inference on morphology and syntax, and both considered phrase-structure trees for Mod-ern Hebrew (Cohen and Smith, 2007; Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008).
 The primary focus of morphological processing in Modern Hebrew is splitting orthographic words into morphemes: clitics such as prepositions, pronouns, and the definite article must be separated from the core word. Each of the resulting morphemes is then tagged with an atomic  X  X art-of-speech X  to indicate word class and some morphological features. Sim-ilarly, the English POS tags in the Penn Treebank combine word class information with morphologi-cal attributes such as  X  X lural X  or  X  X ast tense X .
Cohen and Smith (2007) separately train a dis-criminative conditional random field (CRF) for seg-mentation and tagging, and a generative probabilis-tic context-free grammar (PCFG) for parsing. At de-coding time, the two models are combined as a prod-uct of experts. Goldberg and Tsarfaty (2008) pro-pose a generative joint model. This paper is the first to use a fully discriminative model for joint morpho-logical and syntactic inference on dependency trees. 2.2 Latin Unlike Modern Hebrew, Latin does not require ex-tensive morpheme segmentation 2 . However, it does have a relatively free word order, and is also highly inflected, with each word having up to nine morpho-logical attributes, listed in Table 2. In addition to its absolute numbers of cases, moods, and tenses, Latin morphology is fusional . For instance, the suffix  X  is in omnis cannot be segmented into morphemes that separately indicate gender, number, and case. According to the Latin morphological database en-coded in M ORPHEUS (Crane, 1991), 30% of Latin nouns can be parsed as another part-of-speech, and on average each has 3.8 possible morphological in-terpretations.

We know of only one previous attempt in data-driven dependency parsing for Latin (Bamman and Crane, 2008), with the goal of constructing a dy-namic lexicon for a digital library. Parsing is per-formed using the usual pipeline approach, first with the TreeTagger analyzer (Schmid, 1994) and then with a state-of-the-art dependency parser (McDon-ald et al., 2005). Head selection accuracy was 61.49%, and rose to 64.99% with oracle morpho-logical tags. Of the nine morphological attributes, gender and especially case had the lowest accu-racy. This observation echoes the findings for Czech (Smith et al., 2005), where case was also the most difficult to disambiguate. This section describes a model that jointly infers morphological and syntactic properties of a sen-tence. It will be presented as a graphical model, Attribute Values

Let n be the number of words and m be the number of possible values for a morphological attribute. The variables are:  X  W ORD : the n words w 1 ,..., w n of the input sen- X  T AG : O ( nm ) boolean variables 3 T a,i,v , corre- X  L INK : O ( n 2 ) boolean variables L i,j corre-We define a probability distribution over all joint as-signments A to the above variables, where Z is a normalizing constant. The assign-ment A is subject to a hard constraint, represented in Figure 2 as T REE , requiring that the values of the L INK variables must yield a tree, which may be non-projective. The factors F k ( A ) represent soft constraints evaluating various aspects of the  X  X ood-ness X  of the tree structure implied by A . We say a factor  X  X ires X  when all its neighboring variables are true and it evaluates to a non-negative real num-ber; otherwise, it evaluates to 1 and has no effect on the product in equation (1). Soft constraints in the model are divided into local and link factors, to which we now turn. 3.1 Local Factors The local factors consult either one word or two neighboring words, and their morphological at-tributes. These factors express the desirability of the assignments of morphological attributes based on lo-cal context. There are three types:  X  T AG -U NIGRAM : There are O ( nm ) such unary  X  T AG -B IGRAM : There are O ( nm 2 ) of such bi- X  T AG -C ONSISTENCY : For each word, the T AG It is clear that so far, none of these factors are aware of the morphological agreement between omnis and amantis , crucial for inferring their syntactic relation. We now turn our attention to link factors, which serve this purpose. 3.2 Link Factors The link factors consult all pairs of words, possibly separated by a long distance, that may have a de-pendency link. These factors model the likelihood of such a link based on the word identities and their morphological attributes:  X  W ORD -L INK : There are O ( n 2 ) such unary fac- X  POS-L INK : There are O ( n 2 m 2 ) such ternary  X  M ORPH -L INK : There are O ( n 2 m 2 ) such To ensure a meaningful comparison with the joint model, our two baselines are both implemented in the same graphical model framework, and trained with the same machine-learning algorithm. Roughly speaking, they divide up the variables and factors of the joint model and train them separately. For mor-phological disambiguation, we use the baseline tag-ger described in  X  4.1. For dependency parsing, our baseline is a  X  X ipeline X  parser (  X  4.2) that infers syn-tax upon the output of the baseline tagger. 4.1 Baseline Morphological Tagger The tagger is a graphical model with the W ORD and T AG variables, connected by the local fac-tors T AG -U NIGRAM , T AG -B IGRAM , and T AG -C
ONSISTENCY , all used in the joint model (  X  3). 4.2 Baseline Dependency Parser The parser has no local factors, but has the same variables as the joint model and the same features from all three families of link factors (  X  3). However, since it takes as input the morphological attributes predicted by the tagger, the T AG variables are now observed. This leads to a change in the structure of the link factors  X  all features from the POS-L
INK factors now belong to the W ORD -L INK fac-tors, since the POS of all words are observed. In short, the features of the parser are a replication of (McDonald et al., 2005), but also extended beyond POS to the other morphological attributes, with the features in the M ORPH -L INK factors incorporated into W ORD -L INK for similar reasons. 5.1 Data Our evaluation focused on the Latin Dependency Treebank (Bamman and Crane, 2006), created at the Perseus Digital Library by tailoring the Prague Dependency Treebank guidelines for the Latin lan-guage. It consists of excerpts from works by eight Latin authors. We randomly divided the 53K-word treebank into 10 folds of roughly equal sizes, with an average of 5314 words (347 sentences) per fold. We used one fold as the development set and performed cross-validation on the other nine.

To measure how well our model generalizes to other highly-inflected, relatively free-word-order languages, we considered Ancient Greek, Hungar-ian, and Czech. Their respective datasets consist of 8000 sentences from the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank (Bamman et al., 2009), 5800 from the Hungarian Szeged Dependency Treebank (Vincze et al., 2010), and a subset of 3100 from the Prague De-pendency Treebank (B  X  ohmov  X  a et al., 2003). 5.2 Training We define each factor in (1) as a log-linear function: Given an assignment A and words W , f h is an indicator function describing the presence or ab-sence of the feature, and  X  h is the corresponding set of weights learned using stochastic gradient ascent, with the gradients inferred by loopy belief propaga-tion (Smith and Eisner, 2008). The variance of the Gaussian prior is set to 1. The other two parameters in the training process, the number of belief propa-gation iterations and the number of training rounds, were tuned on the development set. 5.3 Decoding The output of the joint model is the assignment to the T AG and L INK variables. Loopy belief propaga-tion (BP) was used to calculate the posterior proba-bilities of these variables. For T AG , we emit the tag with the highest posterior probability as computed by sum-product BP. We produced head attachments by first calculating the posteriors of the L INK vari-ables with BP and then passing them to an edge-factored tree decoder. This is equivalent to mini-mum Bayes risk decoding (Goodman, 1996), which is used by Cohen and Smith (2007) and Smith and Eisner (2008). This MBR decoding procedure en-forces the hard constraint that the output be a tree but sums over possible morphological assignments. 5 5.4 Reducing Model Complexity In principle, the joint model should consider every possible combination of morphological attributes for every word. In practice, to reduce the complexity of the model, we used a pre-existing morphological database, M ORPHEUS (Crane, 1991), to constrain the range of possible values of the attributes listed in Table 2; more precisely, we add a hard constraint, requiring that assignments to the T AG variables be compatible with M ORPHEUS . This constraint signif-icantly reduces the value of m in the big-O notation Model Tagger Joint Tagger Joint Attr.

To illustrate the effect, the graphical model of the sentence in Table 1, whose six words are all cov-ered by the database, has 1,866 factors; without the benefit of the database, the full model would have 31,901 factors.

The M ORPHEUS database was automatically gen-erated from a list of stems, inflections, irregular forms and morphological rules. It covers about 99% of the distinct words in the Latin Dependency Tree-bank. At decoding time, for each fold, the database is further augmented with tags seen in training data. After this augmentation, an average of 44 words are  X  X nseen X  in each fold.

Similarly, we constructed morphological dictio-naries for Czech, Ancient Greek, and Hungarian from words that occurred at least five times in the training data; words that occurred fewer times were unrestricted in the morphological attributes they could take on. We compare the performance of the pipeline model (  X  4) and the joint model (  X  3) on morphological dis-ambiguation and unlabeled dependency parsing. Model Tagger Joint Tagger Joint Attr.

Among words not covered by the morphological database, accuracy in POS is slightly better, but lower for case, gender and num-ber.

The joint model made the most gains on adjec-tives and participles. Both parts-of-speech are par-ticularly ambiguous: according to M ORPHEUS , 43% of the adjectives can be interpreted as another POS, most frequently nouns; while participles have an av-erage of 5.5 morphological interpretations. Both also often have identical forms for different genders, numbers and cases. In these situations, syntactic considerations help nudge the joint model to the cor-rect interpretations.

Experiments on the other three languages bear out similar results: the joint model improves morpho-logical disambiguation. The performance of Czech (Table 4) exhibits the closest analogue to Latin: gen-der, number, and case are much less accurately pre-dicted than are the other morphological attributes. Like Latin, Czech lacks definite and indefinite arti-cles to provide high-confidence cues for noun phrase boundaries.

The Ancient Greek treebank comprises both ar-chaic texts, before the development of a definite ar-ticle, and later classic Greek, which has a definite article; Hungarian has both a definite and an indefi-nite article. In both languages (Tables 5 and 6), noun and adjective gender, number, and case are more accurately predicted than in Czech and Latin. The verbal system of ancient Greek, in contrast, is more complex than that of the other languages, so mood, voice, and tense accuracy are lower. 6.2 Dependency Parsing In addition to morphological disambiguation, we also measured the performance of the joint model on dependency parsing of Latin and the other lan-guages. The baseline pipeline parser (  X  4.2) yielded 61.00% head selection accuracy (i.e., unlabeled at-tachment score, UAS), outperformed 7 by the joint model at 61.88%. The joint model showed simi-lar improvements in Ancient Greek, Hungarian, and Czech.

Wrong decisions made by the baseline tagger of-ten misled the pipeline parser. For adjectives, the ex-ample shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 is a typical sce-nario, where an accusative adjective was tagged as nominative, and was then misanalyzed by the parser as modifying a verb (as a subject) rather than mod-ifying an accusative noun. For participles modify-ing a noun, the wrong noun was often chosen based on inaccurate morphological information. In these cases, the joint model, entertaining all morpholog-ical possibilities, was able to find the combination of links and morphological analyses that are collec-tively more likely.

The accuracy figures of our baselines are compa-rable, but not identical, to their counterparts reported in (Bamman and Crane, 2008). The differences may partially be attributed to the different morphologi-cal tagger used, and the different learning algorithm, namely Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) in (McDonald et al., 2005) rather than maximum likelihood. More importantly, the Latin Dependency Treebank has grown from about 30K at the time of the previous work to 53K at present, resulting in sig-nificantly different training and testing material. Gold Pipeline Parser When given perfect mor-phological information, the Latin parser performs at 65.28% accuracy in head selection. Despite the or-acle morphology, the head selection accuracy is still below other languages. This is hardly surprising, given the relatively small training set, and that the  X  X he most difficult languages are those that combine a relatively free word order with a high degree of in-flection X , as observed at the recent dependency pars-ing shared task (Nivre et al., 2007); both of these are characteristics of Latin.

A particularly troublesome structure is coordina-tion; the most frequent link errors all involve either a parent or a child as a conjunction. In a list of words, all words and coordinators depend on the final coor-dinator. Since the factors in our model consult only one link at a time, they do not sufficiently capture this kind of structures. Higher-order features, partic-ularly those concerned with links with grandparents and siblings, have been shown to benefit dependency parsing (Smith and Eisner, 2008) and may be able to address this issue. We have proposed a discriminative model that jointly infers morphological properties and syntactic structures. In evaluations on various highly-inflected languages, this joint model outperforms both a base-line tagger in morphological disambiguation, and a pipeline parser in head selection.

This model may be refined by incorporating richer features and improved decoding. In particular, we would like to experiment with higher-order features (  X  6), and with maximum a posteriori decoding, via max-product BP or (relaxed) integer linear program-ming. Further evaluation on other morphological systems would also be desirable.
