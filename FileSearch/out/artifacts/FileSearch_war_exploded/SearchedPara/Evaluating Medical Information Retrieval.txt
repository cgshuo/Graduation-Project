 This paper presents a framework for evaluating information retrieval of medical records. We use the BLULab corpus, a large collection of real-world de-identified medical records. The collection has been hand coded by clinical terminolo-gists using the ICD-9 medical classification system. The ICD codes are used to devise queries and relevance judgements for this collection. Results of initial test runs using a base-line IR system show that there is room for improvement in medical information retrieval. Queries and relevance judge-ments are made available at http://aehrc.com/med_eval .

With the advent of electronic medical records and the con-tinued increase of medical documents online (e.g. MED-LINE) there is an increasing need for information retrieval systems tailored to searching medical free-text [1]. Search-ing medical records presents some specific challenges. For example the presence of an organism in a laboratory test might lead a human being to conclude a certain disease, even though this is not stated explicitly. Furthermore, a user formulating a query might specify the active ingredient of a pharmaceutical, whereas the patient record might only state the brand name of a drug containing that ingredient [2]. We require IR systems capable of bridging the  X  X emantic gap X   X  overcoming the mismatch between the terms found in documents and the terms used in queries.

 Another challenge for medical IR is empirical evaluation. To our knowledge no standardised evaluation framework ex-ists. There is no test collection with associated queries and relevance judgements specific to medical records. Although there are biomedical test collections (e.g. TREC Genomics Track), these differ from medical records in that they focus specifically on identifying genes and associated diseases.
Our contributions to medical information retrieval are: (i) development of an evaluation framework using real world (de-identified) medical records (ii) collection of queries ex-tracted from the medical records using the standard ICD-9 medical code terminology (iii) relevance judgements devised from human classified ICD-9 medical records (iv) results of initial test runs on the collection using a baseline state-of-the-art IR system.
Our test corpus is the BLULab NLP repository 1 , a col-lection of 81,617 de-identified clinical records from multiple U.S. hospitals during 2007. The collection is available to the community for research purposes. A number of differ-ent medical record types are provided, including: History and Physical Exams, Progress Notes, Consultation Reports, Radiology Reports, Emergency Department Reports, Dis-charge Summaries, Operative Reports, Cardiology Reports.
Each record has been coded by professional clinical ter-minologists using the ICD-9 classification system. ICD (In-ternational Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) is a coding of diseases, symptoms, abnor-mal findings, complaints, social circumstances and external causes of injury, as classified by the World Health Organ-isation. These ICD codes are used to extract queries and relevance judgements.
The process for developing a test set of queries and rel-evance judgements is illustrated in Figure 1. The steps re-quired are:
 X  Each ICD code is considered an individual query, the

 X  The ICD code and record filename are then added to
Queries length ranged from 1 to 98 words with an aver-age of 18 words. Each query had on average 231 relevance judgements. Average document length was 365 words.
The ICD terminology is primarily used by hospitals for administrative and billing purposes. Consequently, there were initially a number of limitations as a result of both the characteristics of the ICD terminology and the manner in which terminologists assign codes to documents:
Granularity of coding Choice of ICD code is highly de-pendent on the diseases being described. For example gen-eral respiratory diagnoses codes are typically used rather than a more specific code, even though one exists. Con-versely, certain high level codes such as  X  X idney X  ( 198.0 ) are hardly used as the terminologist would favour the use of a code specific to a disease. This affects the quality of relevance judgements.

ICD term hierarchy ICD codes in the form XXX.XX can only be understood in the context of their parent, e.g.  X  X ep-ticemia X  ( 038 ) has a child  X  X ther X  ( 038.49 ).  X  X ther X  obvi-ously cannot be used as the query text for our evaluation so in these cases the query is formed by concatenation of the parent and child, thus forming  X  X epticemia Other X .
Using the evaluation framework described we provide the results of a number of baseline experiments on the BLULab corpus. Experiments were conducted on the entire corpus and on a number of subsets. The results presented in Ta-ble 1 were obtained with the Indri search engine, Porter stemmer and tf-idf term weighting, which performed better in comparison to a state-of-the-art BM25 system.

Run A, using all the documents, resulted in very low performance. This can be attributed in part to the many laboratory reports which contain little or no natural lan-guage. Excluding these documents in Run B improved re-sults. Run C used only Discharge Summaries which repre-sent a good overview of the patient encounter, using only these documents again improved performance. Run D ex-cluded ICD codes of type  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  which are adminis-trative rather than clinical in nature. Run E mapped ICD codes to SNOMED CT, a formal ontology for medical knowl-edge. This was done to determine whether SNOMED CT had better concept descriptions for use as query text.
In short, our framework provides a meaningful evaluation of medical IR. The low performance prompted some manual review which reaffirmed the challenges in medical IR, specif-ically the  X  X emantic gap X  that exists between queries and documents. Bridging this gap involves more than match-ing keywords, it requires inference. The results also show plenty of scope for future work and strong motivation for a semantic search approach to medical information retrieval.
An evaluation framework for medical IR is provided using a human classified corpus of de-identified medical records. Queries and relevance judgements are devised from the hu-man assigned ICD-9 codes. Initial results from test runs using a state-of-art baseline IR system show there is room for improvement and future work. Our queries and relevance judgements are available for other researches in medical in-formation retrieval at http://aehrc.com/med_eval . [1] W. Hersh. Information retrieval: a health and [2] C.
