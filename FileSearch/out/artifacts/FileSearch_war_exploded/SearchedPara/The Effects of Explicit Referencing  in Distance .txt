 Explicit Referencing is a mechanism for enabling deictic gestures in on-line communication. Little is known about the impact of ER on distance problem solving. In this paper, we report on a study where 120 students (60 pairs) had to solve a problem collaboratively, at a distance, using chat tools that differed in the way a user may relate an utteran ce to the task context. Results indicate that team performance is improved by explicit referencing mechanisms. However, when Explicit Referencing is implemented in a way that is de trimental to the linearity of the conversation, resulting in the visu al dispersion or scattering of messages, its use has negative consequences for collaborative work at a distance. The role of a linear message history in the collaboration mechanisms was equally important than that of Explicit Referencing.

Let's imagine the following situation: Mary, Arnie and Desney have to organize an international conference in Florence, Italy. Mary is working in Seattle, while Arnie is traveling to Asia, and Desney is visiting a friend in P ittsburgh. Despite time differences and the reduced bandwidth they have, they manage to meet online in a chat room to discuss which hotels to suggest on the conference web site. Mary looks up the conference center on GoogleMaps so she can show to the others the exact location. She copies the URL of the retrieved map and pastes it in the chat window. Desney is the first to retrieve the page. He also queries the map service to visualize the closest hotels in that area. He copy/pastes the URL of the resu lts page for his friends. Arnie points out that they should select only those hotels that are within a walking distance from the confer ence location. According to the scale of the map, he highlights, two of the ten proposed hotels are too far. He uses the letters associ ated with the landmarks of the map to specify which ones. In situations like the one above, it is rather difficult to have smooth interactions. Conversation participants have to rely on light-bandwidth elements, like a landmark, to propel the conversation. Recent work has shown that even when a full-duplex audio and video link is ava ilable, remotely located peers perform worse than co-located teams in a bicycle repair task [21]. This suggests that more research is needed to identify the critical elements of communication that make collaboration in presence so effective [26]. The usefulness of a shared display for remote collaborative work depends on the extent to which the system offers valid alternatives for the visual cues available to collaborators performing the task when co-located. In this work, we focus on a simple mechanism like the act of copy/pasting of the URL (in the ex ample above) that translates a face-to-face deictic gesture into a virtual gesture, by joining the shared map to the conversation. We call this Explicit Referencing. It is becoming common practice to share Geo-URLs during a chat session to point to a spatial resource and physically situate the conversation. Also, recent de velopment of Location-Based Services has resulted in a wide range of practices of sharing geographical landmarks (virtual notes pointing to physical locations) or other forms of location-based content 1 . In many situations, the communi cation application is divorced from a landmarks service, like in the example above. Some applications are specifically designed to make the link between a location and a message explicit, like ConcertChat described in section 3. Links can also be made explicit using different mechanisms: ( a ) messages can be overlaid on the shared map, or ( b ) live in a separate space, linked to landmarks with symbols or traits. Both approaches, a and b , enable Explicit Referencing between the conversation and the shared display. http://sociallight.com that offer this kind of map plus content mash-ups. In this paper we revise the following question: does making the connections of utterances to elem ents of the shared visual space explicit enhance the participants X  pe rformance in a collaborative problem solving task at a distance? The hypothesis suggested by the literature is that making this information explicit helps in disambiguating references to sh ared objects, thus improving the collaboration process (see Section 2). However, if utterances are overlaid on a map ( a in the previous paragraph), they are no longer sequentially displayed as in a chat window but appear scattered over the map. This di spersion of utterances may be detrimental to the joint maintenance of the context of the conversation (see Section 5). This contribution addresses this trade-off: supporting references to work space while maintaining the clarity of the conversational space, in the context of collaborative work over a shared map. We report the results of an experimental study where we compared performance and processes of teams who had to organize a music festival on our university campus. They used a chat tool and a shared map. We compare experimental conditions where participants shared information li nked to the map against a control setup where participants used a standard chat tool (see Section 4). We identified two types of contexts that have an effect on collaborative work: the set of previ ous utterances that peers rely on to interpret the current utterance, or the conversation-context , and the set of objects and the environment that the peers are talking about, or the task-context . Of course, the context also includes many other aspects such as shared backgrounds or institutional settings, but we fo cus on these two sources of referencing. The reader would be right to object that the task and conversation contexts are deeply intertwined from a cognitive point of view and form a single context. Nevertheless, from the standpoint of the interface, the task-related-space and the conversation-related-space often occur on the screen as two distinct areas. This has cognitive implications, as we will discuss in Section 5. People working together to solve a problem need a shared language to communicate. They also need to coordinate their activities, defining common goals and strategies to achieve them. Clark developed a theory descri bing how conversational partners develop a shared understanding, building shared knowledge or common ground [6]. Clark defined the process of reaching this common ground, called grounding, as the effort of the conversational partners to sh are their attitudes, beliefs, expectations and mutual knowledge [6, 9]. Clark and Brennan argue that the effort required to maintain a common ground throughout the collaboration are critically dependent on the features of the media the conversation participants use to communicate [7]. For example the media can influence the listener's ability to provide feedback to provide or to seek clarification. Let us consider a case where two peers are discussing where to meet by m obile phone. The first is guiding the second to the meeting point and is offering detailed information. The second is followi ng this information to reach the first speaker. Without visual cont act, the first speaker will tend to use a detailed description of th e landmarks with a consequent high effort and high probability of misunderstanding and consequent repair. In a different situation, if the two peers can share a common map where the first speaker can use deictic gestures, then the resulting dialog will be much lighter in terms of word use and effort required. Many features of the communication media influence grounding, but on this paper we will focus on two resources for grounding X  X  shared work space and a linear dialogue history X  X s these can be directly mapped to the task-context and the conversation-context of the task, respectively. A handful of researchers have worked to explain the role of shared visual information on c onversational grounding [1, 13, 14, 22]. Visual information has been described by Clark and Marshall [8] as one of the strongest sources for verifying mutual knowledge. Visual information can also be used to coordinate the shared language with which object s and locations are described [14]. For example, if an utte rance is ambiguous in a certain context (e.g., "take the red book on the table", with multiple reddish books on the same table), this can be easily disambiguated by joining a deictic gesture to the contribution (e.g., "take that book"). Also many scholars have detaile d the role of persistence in communication [4, 10, 18, 24]. Di alogue persistence has many effects on collaborative work: it reduces the cognitive load by providing an external representation of jointly shared information; it provides a means for pairs to parallelize communication and actions [15], and it affects collabor ative task performances [24]. However, while previous work targets the understanding of the global role of these resources on communication, in this paper we want to focus on a particular cla ss of shared visual information, namely explicit referencing as defi ned in the next subsection, and to study the effects of the availability of this feature on collaborative work at distance. We henceforth use the term Explicit Referencing (ER in short) to refer to the possibility of making manifest the link between an object/a point in the shared visual space and a particular workspace, thus influencing the task-context. ER can also join an utterance with a previous utte rance, thus influencing the conversation-context. Explicit re ferencing is a general concept that is closely related to severa l notions such as artifact-centered discourse [30], anchored discourse [17], anchored conversations [5], or document-centered discourse [2]. Some studies have investigated th e effects of referencing to task-context on collaborative work at a distance: the more the objects the conversation refers to are visible and shared by the communication peers, the better the performance in the collaboration. Van der Pol et al. [32, 33] researched context enhancement for co-intentionality and co-reference in asynchronous computer-mediate d communication. The authors developed a tool for linking student s X  conversations to documents under discussion. Results indicated that the tool reinforced the task-context by providing a frame of reference for the conversation and reduced topic-drift in the answers posted in the forum. They concluded that exp licit referencing to task-context benefits students X  online learning conversations. Purnell et al. [27] found similar results in different settings. They studied the effects on cognitive resources of splitting attention between technical illustrations and their descriptors. Their results suggested that the format of t echnical illustrations was superior when descriptors were contained within the diagram, as cognitive resources were not required to in tegrate the descriptors and the diagram. This is referred to as the split-attention effect [3]. M X lhpfordt and Wessner [25] de veloped ConcertChat, a chat communication tool in which contributions can explicitly refer to other contributions or regions in the shared material. They found that explicit referencing leads to a more homogeneous discourse, i.e. to more homogeneous particip ation and more participation in parallel discussion threads. Stah l et al. [29] reported similar results using ConcertChat in a math course, highlighting the importance of joint referencing for collaboration. Other researchers have investigat ed referencing to conversation context on collaboration at a dist ance. McCarthy and Monk [24] presented a controlled experiment to assess the effect of dialogue history in a referential communication task. They found that a larger dialogue history enabled the pairs to reference utterances that occurred much earlier in the discussion. Smith et al. [28] presented a syst em to organize the contributions of a chat in a threaded interface. They hypothesized that this tool would reduce the ambiguity of certain contributions due to intertwined turn taking. The results of the study showed that patterns of interaction in threaded chat were equally effective, but different than standard chat progr ams. However, users rated their threaded chat as worse than a regular chat program. Fuks et al. [12] developed a tool to avoid chat confusion : the problem that occurs in situations where it becomes difficult to follow the conversation as two or more topics become intertwined in turn-taking and result in an in crease in the ambiguity of short answers. The author proposed a chat tool, called Mediated Chat, where it is possible to regulate the turn taking using predefined modalities like  X  X ree contributions X , where each participant can send a message at any time; or  X  X ircular contributions X , where the participants are organized in a circular queue). The authors report that chat confusion is more likely to occur during free contributions. More precisely, during the branching-out phase of the free conversation, other topi cs were discussed that made confusion more likely to occur. To summarize this discussion of related work, it is clear that explicit referencing to task-cont ext and to conversation-context has an influence on task convers ation. Still, little is known about the interplay between these two communication contexts. In this paper, we investigate whet her supporting task-context and conversation-context referencing, in a task involving spatial coordination, enhances colla boration. We derived three hypotheses from the above studies: H1. Explicit referencing leads to better team performance. H2. Explicit referencing makes communication more efficient (fewer sentences, with fewer words). H3. The persistence of the conve rsation leads to better team performance. Participant pairs had to collaborate remotely using a chat tool and a map to organize a festival on their university campus. Completing the task required decidi ng which parking lots to use, where to position the three stages of the event and how to allocate six artists to the three availabl e stages. They therefore had to perform a number of optimizati ons, such as minimizing the distance between the chosen parki ng areas to the initial stage and between stages according to the schedule of the events. Additionally each parking lot had a different rental price that was somewhat proportional to its capacity. One of the constraints required the subjects to minimize the budget for the concert. Finally, as setting up a concert on a stage required appropriate  X  X ound checks X , subjects had to choose the order of the concerts so as to minimize the waiting time of the spectators, and an appropriate distance among the stages so as to minimize the disturbance of sound checks on running concerts. To perform the task, the subjects had to position a series of icons on a campus map: a number of  X  X   X  signs to mark the active parking lots, three stage icons a nd six small circled numbers, one for each event to be allocated (p art (b) of figure 1). The positions of these icons were not synchronized across the participants X  displays: a subject could not see where the other would position his/her icons. This design augmented the difficulty in finely coordinating the position of the icons between the two screens, so to observe how the arising conflicts could be solved at a linguistic level and/or with the different communication tools. This design was also chosen so to eliminate the effect of the feedthrough (the mechanism of determining a pe rson X  X  interactions through the sights of artifacts) [16] on the team X  X  performance. 120 students from our university volunteered to participate to the experiment. They were selected based on their mother language, their course year, their faculty and finally for their knowledge and use of computers and, in particul ar, chat applications. They were all native French speakers. We did not recruit participants in the first or the second year of their program as this could have an effect on the level of their knowle dge of the campus site and in turn on the task performance. The subjects did not know each other and were randomly matched from different faculties. Students from Architecture or Civil Engineering were excluded as they could have biased the results as they are more used to working with maps. They were recruited using an e-mail based call for participation and a telephonic short interview, which helped to ascertain that they regularly used a chat application and that they did not had any ocular disabilities (e.g., colorblindness). Each participant was remunerated 30 Swiss Francs fo r the participation (~18.30 EUR or ~24.85 USD). Participants were randomly assi gned to 60 dyads. Fifteen dyads were assigned to each of the f our conditions described in 3.5 below. the message window to the point of reference with an arrow. The members of a pair were each seated in front of identical desktop computers with 18-inch LCD eye-tracker displays (maker: Tobii , model: 1750), and located in two different rooms. The settings of the rooms, the working table and the light conditions were identical. On arrival, participants were gi ven an instruction sheet containing the rules they had to respect in placing the elements on the map, information on how to evaluate th eir solution, and the principles behind the calculation of the score. Next, they were asked to watch a short video summarizing th e instructions and explaining the particular communication tool they had to use to collaborate. Prior of starting the task, the par ticipants could ask questions to the experimenter if they had any doubt on the instructions they were given or which they understood from the video. During the task, each participant had at his/her disposal: a feedback tool (part (a) of figure 1), a map of the campus (part (e) of figure 1) and a chat application to communicate with the partner. The feedback tool offered a score button (part (v) of figure 1), pressing which would force the display of a number between 0 and 100 assigned comparing the proposed solution with the optimal solution that was calculated once for all the experiments by the machine. This tool presented also four sub-scores one for each goal and the combined team-score. Each graph presented a horizontal red line, representing the maximum score that could be achieved and a vertical red line marking the time limit of the task. The tool also showed the remaining time to complete the task in the bottom-le ft corner (part (v) of figure 1). The task lasted 45 minutes, while the briefing session lasted 15 minutes. As the task required multiple optimizations, we allowed each pair to submit multiple soluti ons to solve the task, ultimately selecting the best score for each team. Pairs were instructed to find the configuration leading to the highest score and to follow a collaborative paradigm, minimizing the position mistakes between the icons on the two machines. They were also advised to take advantage of the feedback tool and the available time to test the maximum number of different configurations. We used the maximum score achieved during the 45 minutes as the primary measure of task pe rformance. To understand how the pairs performed in different c onditions we explored several features of conversation structur e: the number of words, number of utterances, and structure of turn taking. Then we looked at the use of linguistic deictic in the form of labels and prepositional phrases. We also recorded eye-gazes on the map to consider different strategies of map reading but we will not detail the results of this analys is in this paper. Our research question is to find out what is the impact of Explicit Referencing in collaborative probl em solving at distance. We therefore varied the type of referencing mechanisms that the communication tool provided: (1) re ferencing to task context: can users relate an utterance to an element to the shared visual space (yes/no) (2) referencing to the conversation context: do users have access to a linear chat history (y es/no). We chose this second dimension because, as discussed in section 2, the availability of a message history is related to the possibility to make references to previous utterances. The design was therefore a standard 2  X  2 factorial design, where Explicit Reference ( ER vs. noER ) and the presence of a linear conversational context ( Hist vs. noHist ) were between-subjects factors. Table 1 reports the four communication tools that we compared in our experimental plan. M ICROSOFT MSN X  is a standard chat application. ShoutSpace and ExtremeChat are chat applications developed in our laboratory, a nd ConcertChat was developed at Fraunhofer-IPSI, in Germany [25]. ExtremeChat ( EC ) is a rudimentary chat application that offers the permanence only of the last utterance emitted by the conversational partner. The next utterance emitted replaces the previ ous one (part (h) of figure 1). ShoutSpace ( ShS ) allows the attaching of messages to a map: by default, the user sees only the anchor points of the messages (part (w) of figure 1). If she clicks on it, the messages appear in a pop-up window. Only one message at a time is visible to the user (part (f) of figure 1). In ConcertChat ( CoC ), visual priority is given to the conversation. Connections to map locations are made by arrows connecting the message from the history panel to the map point (part (z) of figure 1), or to other messages in the hi story pane. Lines are refreshed as utterances move up the chat hi story (part (g) of figure 1). Conditions ShS and CoC differ from condition MSN and EC in that they enable explicit referencing to a map-object, while conditions MSN and CoC differ from condition ShS or EC in that the chat history is displayed sequentially while in ShS, messages are scattered all over the map, and in EC is not possible to see messages older than the last part ner X  X  utterance and not even the user X  X  own messages. Both MSN and CoC thus facilitate maintaining the conversation context and making implicit references. Additionally, CoC allows explicit references to previous messages in the chat history. The explicit references created with ShS or CoC were part of the shared visual space and therefore synchronized on the two machines. However, the icons on each machine were handled by widget software that kept them on a topmost graphical layer. They were completely se parated from the different communication tools tested in th e experiment. The message input field in each of the four interfaces was about the same size. The availability of a linear chat history had a large impact on the score. Pairs had substantially hi gher scores with a linear message history, compared to those in which the history was not linear (Hist: m=87.32, sd=5.08 pts vs. noHist: m=79.23, sd=7.41 pts; F[1,58]=81.22, p&lt;.001). This result is consistent with H3, which predicted higher scores for trials with applications with a linear message history. The availability of an Explicit Referencing mechanism had an impact on the score obtained by th e teams. The pairs using a chat application supporting ER had lower scores compared to those in which this mechanism was not av ailable (ER: m=81.63, sd=9.61 pts vs. noER: m=84.92, sd=4.07 pt s; F[1,58]=13.37, p&lt;.001). This result was not consistent with H1, which was predicting higher scores for trials with applica tions supporting ER. However, we should caution that this result was generated by averaging of the scores of ConcertChat, the highest of the experiment, with the scores of ShoutSpace, the lowest of the experiment. The impact of Explicit Referencing on the score was larger when a chat history was present. The Explicit Referencing  X  Message History interaction showed that ER was useful only when the chat tool offered also a persistence of the conversation messages (for the interaction F[1,58]=124.38, p&lt;.001). A TukeyHSD post hoc test confirmed that all the cond itions differ when taken two by two (95% family-wise confidence le vel, factor levels ordered, p&lt;.001), with the exception of the combination EC  X  MSN (p=0.44, ns). This last result is not cons istent with H3, which predicted higher scores for trials with a pplications with a linear message history. See Figure 2 for the interaction plot. Figure 2. Interaction plot of Explicit Referencing  X  Message 
History. The fences represent the standard error of mean. To understand how the media changed the structure of the conversation and its efficiency , we measured the number of utterances, the number of words, and the number of words per utterance for each condition. In the rest of the paper, we will use the word utterance to mean a single message sent through the chat application. Additionally, we m easured whether the turn taking was symmetric. We computed the ratio between the number of times in which the speaker switched over the total number of contributions. (i.e., if ab is the total number of transitions from subject a to b , and bb is the total number of transition from [aa + ab + ba + bb] ). A perfectly balanced turn taking would give a ratio of 1. The resulting data are summarized in Table 2. We choose these measures because they correlate significantly with the score: the number of u tterances is positively correlated with the pair score (r = 0.53, t[58]= 4.82, p&lt;.001); the number of words per utterance is negatively correlated with the score (r = -negatively correlated with the pair score (r = -0.56, t[58]= -5.20, p&lt;.001). When we varied the availability of the Explicit Referencing mechanism, we did not register a significant difference in the number of utterances produced. However, the number of words was smaller when pairs could use ER compared to when they could not (ER: m=865.00, sd =323.14 vs. noER: m=1102.00, sd=323.43 words per experiment; F[1,58]=8,34, p&lt;.006). This also reflected on the number of words per utterance that was significantly higher in the ER condition compared to the noER condition (ER: m=16.54, sd=33. 47 vs. noER: m=6.65, sd=4.62 words per utterance; F[1,58]=9. 75, p&lt;.003). Finally the turn taking was more symmetric when the participants could use an explicit referencing mechanism compared to the opposite condition (ER: m=0.71, sd=0.20 vs. noER: m=0.64, sd=0.14; F[1,58]=4.80, p&lt;.05). These results are partially consistent with H2, which predicted more efficient communication with applications supporting ER. Participant with a message history doubled the number of utterances (Hist: m=242.20, sd= 96.71 vs. noHist: m=103.70, sd=57.69 utterances per experi ment; F[1,58]=53.00, p&lt;.001). While this leads to more words per experiment, the difference was not significant. On the contrary, we found the difference of words per utterance to be significant. Pairs with a message history employed almost a fourth of the words per message then pairs with no message history (His t: m=4.81, sd=2.69 vs. noHist: m=16.84, sd=28.36 words per utte rance; F[1,58]=81.86, p&lt;.001). Finally, pairs with a message history had the least symmetric turn taking compared to those with no message history (Hist: m=0.55, sd=0.15 vs. noHist: 0.79, sd=0 .10; F[1,58]=63.51, p&lt;.001). We can therefore summarize these results saying that we found two dialogue styles: lots of s hort interwoven utterances for applications CoC and MSN and few, symmetric, and long contributions for applications ShS and EC . As the task required precise pos itioning on the shared map, we used three markers to measure how different linguistic devices were used in function of the di fferent media. We counted the number of prepositional phrases (e.g., " on the right hand-side of the parking lot", " below the  X  X  X -shaped building", etc.). Similarly we counted the number of spatial a dverbial clauses that were used as positioning device in the dialogue (e.g.,  X  X eave the parking icon where it is  X ). Finally, we counted the number of deictic expressions used in the convers ation (e.g.,  X  X  placed the second concert here  X , or  X  X ove your icon there  X ). Table 3 presents the resulting data. The manipulation of the availability of the message history did not produce any significant difference in these three categories. On the contrary, the manipulation of the availability of the Explicit Referencing mechanism led to significant differences across the three markers. Participant pairs using tools that allowed for Explicit Referencing used almost three times fewer prepositional phrases (ER: m=12. 03, sd=8.21 vs. noER: m=30.57, sd=13.04 prepositional phrases pe r experiment; F[1,58]=43.84, p&lt;.001). On the contrary, partic ipants with ER produced three times more place adverbial clauses than participants without (ER: m=15.37, sd=11.13 vs. noER: m=4. 37, sd=4.34 adverbial clauses per experiment; F[1,58]=23.54, p&lt;. 001). Lastly, participants with ER produced two times more linguis tic deictic than participants without (ER: m=16.60, sd=11. 99 vs. noER: m=6.83, sd=3.26 deictic expressions per experi ment; F[1,58]=19.07, p&lt;.001). These results suggests that partic ipants adapt their communication strategy to reduce their grounding effort. Why could participant pairs complete their experiment with fewer utterances when they did not ha ve a message history? Without message permanence, participants concentrated on the essential facts that had to be communicated to solve the task. They used more words per message, and em ployed a more regular turn taking in order to minimize info rmation loss. The transcripts reported below were translated from French. Excerpt (1.1) reports two fragmen t of the conversation between the pairs when they were using ShoutSpace or MSN chat. The pairs were in both cases trying to position a stage on the plan. The interaction lasted about the same time in both cases . This excerpt demonstrates how the pair took advantage of the spatial position at which the messages were positioned in ShoutSpace to reduce the information conveyed by the te xt. It also demonstrates how the presence of the history brought the pair to alternate different subjects of discussion. Excerpt (1.2) shows how participants who had at their disposal an Explicit Referencing tool preferre d using deictic acts instead of more elaborated linguistic descrip tions that could potentially lead to miscomprehensions. This fragmen t also shows how participants used the only labels present on th e map, namely the parking lots capacity, as a grounding anchor to situate their discussion. For the stages they usually used a cust om-made code, generally using the capacity label of the closest parking. Excerpt (1.3) exemplifies how the lack of the message history influenced the way participants had to structure their contributions in order to be unde rstood: each message had to be self-explanatory as previous uttera nces might be not relevant any more for the message recipient. Our initial hypothesis was that participants in the MSN or the EC condition would perform worse than those in the other conditions because of the difficulty they could experience in disambiguating verbal descriptions of map locations. The results of our experiments refine this initial assumption. The two communication contexts, the conve rsation-context and the task-context, influenced different aspects of the collaboration. Actually, some utterances  X  X or instance, about positioning parking icons X  do refer to map locations while others  X  X amely discussing the task strategy or management X  are independent of any location. The interface of ShoutSpace, like other commercial analogue interfaces, fosters links of the c onversation to the task-context to the detriment of maintaining the coherence of conversation-context. MSN chat and ExtremeChat have the inverse effect, not supporting Explicit Referencing. C oncertChat, on the other hand, supports both sides of the interaction context. From a qualitative analysis of the experiments, we observed that participants preferred to express task-management utterances via the classical chat and used the shared pointers for the action-related utterances, when available. This appears to be consistent with the results reported by Dillenbourg and Traum [11], who compared the content exchanged on a whiteboard and in a chat application in a collaborative problem solving. They found that users spontaneously display the more persistent information on the more persistent medium (the whiteboard), which serves as group working memory. Cross-refere ncing the verbal utterances and whiteboard objects was mainly achieved by explicit verbal references and subtle timing cues. Participants in the ShS condition were forced to  X  X e-spatialize X  management utterances, m oving these messages over non-functional parts of the map in su ch a way as not to jam other important information shown on th e map. Also, the fragmentation of the conversation resulted in fewer messages with a higher number of words per message. In othe r words, participants tried to reconstruct the conversation-cont ext increasing the words for each message and decreasing the number of messages as moving to the next one required an extra effort for reconstructing, in the participant X  X  mind, the conversation-context. While in the MSN condition we often observed that multiple conversations were concatenated (sometimes with a resulting confusion), participants in the ShS condition often reported a difficulty in following multiple conversations at the same time. This led them to have a more structured turn taking to prevent confusion. Conversely, participants in the MSN or EC condition had to develop positioning and routing st rategies for placing the icons. When interviewed after the task, almost all of the participants in these conditions noticed that th e capacity of the parking lots, marked on the map, was a unique number and used that as an anchor for disambiguating the positioning with the partner. In contrast, participants in the ShS condition rarely noticed these unique labels. As the placement of the stages was often done after that of the parking lots, these were used as landmarks and as routing points for the positioning of the stages. This resulted as an increased use of prepositional phr ases (e.g.,  X  X n the right hand-side of P450 X ) or adverbial clause s. Participants in this condition took not only full advantage of the parking lots capacity labels, using these to easily indicate which parking lots to select to the partner but also to sub-partition the map space so as to reduce confusion (e.g.,  X  X he stage close to P140 X ). Our results are not consistent with those presented by Gergle et al. performance. While they reported an improvement of the performance for those pairs with message persistence in their experiment, we did not find the same spread between the condition EC and MSN . In our analysis of the messages, we observed that participants adapte d to the restriction imposed by the application modifying their communication strategies (more words per messages, with salient facts, and with a slower pace). It is important to notice that we designed a task that was more complex than the task used by th ese authors. In this regard, our results seem more similar to t hose presented by McCarthy and Monk [24]. Participants in the CoC condition obtained the highest scores, showing a positive influence of explicit referencing on collaborative work at distance. Th is result is coherent with the results presented by Purnell et al. [27], who showed that a direct visual relation between technical illustrations and explanations is beneficial to learning. However, our two studies differed in that while they were working with st atic content. we designed an experiment where participants had to actively interact to propose a common solution. As reported by M X lpfordt et al. [25] we also noticed that Explicit Referencing leads to more balanced discourse, with a positive impact on problem-solving performan ces. This is also coherent with the results presented by Fuks et al. [12] on the regulation of chat conversation to avoid confusi on. Similarly, we noticed that a more symmetric turn taking has a positive effect on the quality of collaboration and the connected problem-solving performances. The results presented in this study partially overlap with those of Wojahn et al. [34]. In their study on the effects of annotation interfaces on collaborative writing, the authors found that participants in the interlinear and aligned conditions, which can be mapped to our ShS and CoC conditions, communicated about significantly more problems than those in the split-screen condition (our MSN or EC condition). Commonly we found that an aligned condition will properly support both a conversation-context and a referential-context compared to a  X  X plit-screen X  condition. However their results do not agree with ours in terms of the definition of the  X  X nline X  condition. Also, the authors reported no differences in the task resolution time, their performance measure. The reasons for these differences are not clear. The results presented in this work demonstrate that in collaborative tasks at distance that involve problem solving on shared maps, Explicit Referenc ing improves teams performance. However if the implementation of this mechanism breaks the linearity of the conversation context (e.g., the message history), performance is reduced. The results presented in this pape r have important implications for the design of systems that aim at supporting collaborative annotations of maps at distance. For such tasks providing links between the conversation and the shared landmarks over the map can be highly beneficial but onl y if the conversation does not fragment in providing this connection. Additionally, we have developed this research looking at how Explicit Referencing might aff ect the positioning of objects on a shared map. Although maps are wonderfully rich artefacts that have specific cognitive implications on human cognition [23, 31], the findings of this work might be transferred to other domains of applications. For example, Googl e recently released a service called GoogleDocs that allows editing a text collaboratively or a working on a spreadsheet while chatting inline with the other participants. Depending on the comp lexity of the document or the number of participants, even pointing to specific parts of a text might become as controversial as routing objects on a map, and with even less spatial cues that a map can offer. Therefore designers should carefu lly consider how to allocate conversation-context-support and task-context-support and which interaction mechanism is allowe d between these two. Keeping them completely separated might not be optimal not just as combining them in the same visual space might have detrimental consequences as well. Another way to look at the results presented in this paper is that reference does not require proxim ity. For instance, a message M may refer to point X with a deictic M-X link and with positive cognitive implications even if the message is not displayed at the location X . A visual link between the two might just be enough. Of course, M and X must be within a certain visual distance beyond which we encounter the split-attention effect [3]. The trade-off between proximity and split attention for referencing should be studied further. We did not vary the task, manipulating the need for using spatial references. Also, there were minor differences in the features of each chat application like the awareness of the other partner typing (in MSN chat or ConcertChat) or threading among the messages in the ShoutSpace application (part (w) of figure 1). Finally, the number of messages in the history of ConcertChat was slightly higher than that of MSN chat. However, analyzing the logs of the eye-trackers we saw that participants rarely made fixations over messages older th an the fifth previous one. This study presented a quasi-experimental design to compare the influence of different media in supporting collaborative work at a distance. We manipulated the experimental conditions in such a way so as to compare situations offering different support for what we defined as Explicit Refe rencing. Our starting hypothesis was that tools offering this ability could better support collaborative tasks at a distance that require precise positioning of objects on a common display. Results indicate that team performance is improved by task referencing mechanisms unless the implementation of this mech anism is detrimental to the linearity of the conversation context (e.g., the message history), in which case, performance is reduced. From the distributed cognition perspective [19], we can summarize our results by stating that each communication tool leads to a different organization of a distributed cognitive system (the user plus the tools). Thes e different organizations produce different conversation styles empl oyed by the collaborators. Tools like ShoutSpace or ExtremeChat, which were found less effective, led the participants to have a more formal interaction to compensate for the shortcomings of the tool they were using. Humans can cope with the limita tions of a communication device up to a certain level beyond which collaboration performance is affected. Ongoing work aims at establishing mediation effects of the process variables that we descri bed in this paper and analyzing other process variables related to the map reading strategy.
