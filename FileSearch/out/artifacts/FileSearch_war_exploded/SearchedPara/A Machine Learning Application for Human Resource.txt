There are great deals of data about every employee. Before tasks allocation, man-one X  X  changing experience. Actually, Human resource allocation is a kind of problem learning approach to dissolve the allocation problem. 
In our paper, a new model is proposed. And we apply fuzzy logic concept into the model. Individual capability matrixes about employees are the data need to be mined. Machine learning methods can offer the matrixes not only based on the previous ap-the original data in the warehouse. The refreshed matrixes will be offered when next cycles. rithms. Finally, we conclude in section 9. tasks control and time control. 2.1 Model on Human Capital Control 1. The follow parameters are aimed at the whole human resource of the firm: The individual capability matrix is in this form. s means the satisfaction degree certain employee doing all the jobs. S is the satisfaction degree appraisal matrix specialists give. s means the satisfaction degree employee i doing the assigned job. A or B are the satisfaction degree fuzzy sets of the tasks.  X  Matrix S 3 = [s i,j  X  i,j  X  N, 1  X  i  X   X  R  X  , 1  X  j  X   X  T  X  , 0  X  s i,j  X  1] which shows the performance evaluation of employee i on task j. R  X  represents the number of the employees;  X  T  X  is the number of the tasks. The final fuzzy synthesis appraisal matrixes needed in our algorithm is in the form.  X  group r m The parameter r is the group name in a firm, and m represents the number of employ-ees in the group. 2. For concrete human resource, it needs other parameters: hr{group, ifFree, freeTimes, tasks, cost}  X  group: The name of technique group the employee belongs to.  X 1 X (occupied) and  X 0 X (free).  X  freeTimes: Time during which the employee can keep free.  X  tasks: Which task the employee has been assigned to.  X  cost: The premium paid for accomplishing certain job. 2.2 Model on Tasks Control 1. For the whole set of tasks:  X  Matrix T = [t i,j  X  i,j  X  N, 1  X  i,j  X   X  T  X  ] between the two tasks. We can also use PERT for distinguishing distinctly. 2. For concrete task, the pa rameters are defined here: task{state, endTime, totalTime, needGroup, penaltyFunc, budget}  X  state: Indicate whether or not the task has begun. The value includes  X 1 X (yes) and  X 0 X (no).  X  endTime: The end time of a task.  X  totalTime: The total time of a task.  X  needGroup: The group and the number of the employees needed in a task. 
Its data is in the form of g r m .  X  penaltyFunc: The penalty function if the task is delayed.  X  budget: The max cost of the task. 2.3 Model on Time Control time{endTime, totalTime}  X  endTime: The end time of a task.  X  totalTime: The total time of a task. The basic model of machine learning can be pictured as follows. There are many applications about collaborations of data mining and machine learn-ing. Many machine learning methods could be used directly into data mining domain. 
Induction learning is one of the machine learning methods. Learning by being told ing by being told method to mine useful data about human resources. follows: 1. Machine asks appraisals from specialists 2. Machine accepts and explains the appraisals.
 3. Machine converts the appraisa ls into concrete knowledge.
 4. Machine adds the new knowledge into the knowledge warehouse. 5. System provides the refreshed results with the help of the knowledge. capability. Define the fuzzy membership sets we use as follows: 1. fuzzy sets for degree of job satisfaction 2. weight values of the fuzzy sets 3. individual capability matrixes 4. fuzzy synthesis appraisal matrixes expect the optimized result in the following multi-objectives programming. 1. Minimize the time in executing the entire tasks spent on the tasks must be less than the total time regulated beforehand. 2. Minimize the whole premium cost to the whole employees employees must be less than the budget regulated beforehand. 
To simplify the model, we only consider the human pay with no regard of cost of penaltyFunc of the tasks here. the same time. So we can only acquire the fuzzy optimization solution. 1. Definition 1: added to j-1. The set of the subtasks replaces its parent task. 2. The algorithm can be described as follows: Suppose Task = {task 1 , task 2 ......task n }, Hr = {hr 1 , hr 2 ....hr m } Algorithm: 1. Scheduling the current set of tasks according to matrix T. 3.

Updating the values of the employees X  individual capability matrix in knowledge Conditions: 
Task = {task1, task2, task3} task1:{g 1 2 , g 2 2 } task2:{g 1 1 , g 3 2 } task3:{g 2 2 , g 3 2 } The set value in the machine learning method is 9/10 After the fifth step we can get the data: usable hr = {hr 1 3 , hr 2 4 , hr 3 2 } Then we know: {hr 11, hr 12, hr 13 } are allocated among {task 11 , task 12 , task 21 } {hr 31, hr 32 } are allocated among {task 21 , task 22 , task 33 , task 34 } First we consider the first allocation. 1. Building the fuzzy sets for degree of job satisfaction due to the goal of time. 2. Building the fuzzy sets for degree of job satisfaction due to the goal of cost. 3. The weight of the two goals Q = {0.6, 0.4} 6. Using the model M( X ,+) in the fuzzy mathematics, we can get the fuzzy synthesis 7. Task-Arrange or Hungarian Algorithm gives the best allocation. 8. Also we can get the allocation result about other tasks and human resources. The above matrixes are aimed to Time factor. The above matrixes are aimed to Cost factor. 10. Refresh the individual capability matrixes. 11. These weight values will be added to the knowledge warehouse and the individ- X  Comparison with linear programming model  X  Comparison with goal programming model  X  Comparison with distributed resource allocation algorithm [7] we construct a human resource fuzzy allocation model.
