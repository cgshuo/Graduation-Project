German HMD Hamburg Metaphor Database MML Master Metaphor List MI Mutual Information NLP Natural Language Processing 1 Introduction Recently, Computational Linguistics has witnessed an increased interest in non-literal language processing, especially in the form of metonymy, metaphor and idiom detection using statistical methods (e.g. Nissim and Markert 2003 ; Degand and Bestgen 2003 ; Fazly and Stevenson 2006 ; Gedigian et al. 2006 ; Birke and Sarkar 2006 ). Detecting non-literal language amounts to deciding whether an instance of a selected class of linguistic expressions X  X uch as Motion-verbs or country names X  X s used literally or not, in a given context. Sometimes, further classification of the non-literal instances into sense groups is attempted (e.g. Nissim and Markert 2003 ; Markert and Nissim 2007 ). However, most statistical approaches to non-literal phenomena do not produce any meaning representation for the detected instances, as would be necessary for drawing inferences (Barnden and Lee 2001 ; Hobbs 1992 ; Narayanan, 1999 ). Also, some of the data used for training and evaluating the statistical approaches have been culled in an ad hoc way, by relying in part on introspective examples from language documentation not intended for Natural Language Processing (NLP) purposes (Degand and Bestgen 2003 ; Fazly and Stevenson 2006 ; Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007 ), or by annotating corpora in an  X  X ntuitive X  fashion (Birke and Sarkar 2006 ).

The situation calls for an in-depth look at non-literal language from the point of view of resource creation. While Markert and Nissim ( 2006 ) reports on metonymy , the present paper concerns metaphor . It provides an account of methods used, problems discovered, and insights gained at the Hamburg Metaphor Database (HMD) project, and is intended to inform similar resource creation initiatives, as well as future implementations of metaphor detection and processing algorithms. The focus is on methodological issues, rather than technical questions or implementation.
 The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the Hamburg Metaphor Database. Section 3 lays out the theoretical underpinnings that motivate the subdivision of represented information into a conceptual level (Sect. 4 ) and a lexical level (Sect. 5 ). The acquisition of metaphor attestations from electronic corpora is explained in Section 6 ; Section 7 looks at metaphor frequency. In terms of evaluation, Section 8 is devoted to annotator agreement, and Section 9 to evaluating database contents against a publicly available corpus. An overview of related resource creation projects is given in Section 10 . The conclusion summarizes the results and outlines possible directions for future work. 2 Background to the Hamburg Metaphor Database The Hamburg Metaphor Database 1 is an online database of predominantly French and some German metaphors, currently illustrated by 1,656 annotated corpus examples. The annotations offer lexical and conceptual information on each attestation, making reference to external standard resources of the field. For lexical information, the EuroWordNet database (Vossen 1999 ) is used, and for conceptual information, labels from the Berkeley Master Metaphor List (Lakoff et al. 1991 ) are added. The database is used for linguistic investigations and, as it grows, it will become an interesting resource for computational approaches to non-literal language.

Initially, the motivation behind the creation of the HMD was the idea of using metaphorical mappings between conceptual domains to provide a new type of link between word senses in WordNet, suggested by Alonge and Castelli ( 2002 ). The proposal makes reference to the Conceptual Theory of Metaphor, a well-established theory in Cognitive Linguistics that facilitates generalization over different metaphorically used lexical items at a conceptual level (see Sect. 3 ). However, the integration of conceptual information into lexical resources is not straightfor-ward. Conceptual domains are not directly accessible to investigation, and relations between them are more difficult to define than relations between lexical units (Cruse 1986 ). Thus, one of the aims of the HMD project is to study the possibility of representing metaphor information in lexical databases in a principled way.
When the project was initiated in 2002, metaphor attestations had already been collected by Master X  X  students at the Institute for Romance Languages, University of Hamburg, in the 1990s. The theses were written within the framework of the Conceptual Theory of Metaphor, each collecting a topic-centered corpus from the French media; some also added a comparable German corpus. The materials were screened for metaphorical language use, and metaphor occurrences were recorded manually and interpreted in terms of conceptual domains, according to the theory. The theses were not intended to feed into resource building for NLP; rather, they were written from a socio-linguistic perspective.

Corpus acquisition at a linguistic institute in the 1990s usually meant collecting paper articles, not electronic texts. Therefore, putting together data for the HMD initially involved reading the theses, copying their examples, and gathering information on the sources. For each metaphor attestation contained in the database, the following pieces of meta-information are recorded:  X  language (French or German);  X  author, title, and year of thesis from which it is drawn, in addition to the  X  one of the following sets:
HMD annotators added conceptual and lexical annotation to each corpus example, as further explained in Sects. 4 and 5 , below. Once the pool of pre-collected data in existing Master X  X  theses was exhausted, the HMD project started collecting electronic corpora, from which metaphors are retrieved (Sect. 6 ).
Technically, the database is implemented in MySQL. It has a simple structure, optimized for easy import of annotations provided in tabbed text format, as opposed to redundance minimization. Figure 1 illustrates the database model with its three tables Metaphor , Corpus , and Thesis . The semantics of the fields in the Metaphor table are explicated in the discussion of conceptual domains and synsets, in Sects. 4 and 5 , below.

For viewing and querying data over the web, Perl scripts and HTML forms are used, with results presented in HTML tables. Figure 2 illustrates this with a selected slice of results for metaphor attestations from the source domain A DIFFERENT PATH , in French. Meta-information for each example is obtained by clicking on the book symbol in the far left column. It is also possible to retrieve the entire contents of the database in HTML format, by simply not restricting the values of the fields in the query form. 3 Conceptual theory of metaphor Every linguistic resource building project ought to make reference to a theory, especially so for a metaphor resource. First of all, there are various theories of metaphor. Second, the identification of metaphorical language use is notoriously  X  X ubjective X . Consequently, the clearer the theoretical foundations of the project, the higher the inter-annotator agreement, for annotator judgment will be based along the same lines of reasoning. Finally, end users will have a better understanding of the data, thereby facilitating re-use.
 The Hamburg Metaphor Database is inspired by Lakoff and Johnson X  X  ( 1980 ) 2 Conceptual Theory of Metaphor, which was then further developed, exemplified or extended by numerous researchers. According to the theory, abstract conceptual domains such as TIME are understood in terms of structurally similar, (more) concrete domains such as MONEY , and this is reflected in language. Examples (1) to (3) illustrate the phenomenon. (1) That flat tire cost me an hour. (2) You need to budget your time. (3) Don X  X  spend too much time talking about yourself.
 With these examples in mind, it is possible to define some terminology. Metaphors make reference to two types of conceptual domains: source domain and target domain .A source domain is a domain providing conceptual access and linguistic expressions; a target domain is a conceptual domain understood in terms of a source domain. Thus, in the examples above, MONEY is the source and TIME the target domain. In Cognitive Linguistics, a mapping between source and target is usually given as XISY , e.g. TIME IS MONEY . The entire mapping is called a conceptual metaphor . This should be differentiated from the linguistic expressions illustrating it, such as the usage of cost , budget , and spend in (1) X (3), above. For these, (Ko  X  vecses 2002 , p. 4) proposes the term metaphorical linguistic expressions .In what follows, they will be referred to as lexical metaphors .

Finally, a conceptual domain can be  X  X  X ny coherent organization of experience X  X  (Ko  X  vecses 2002 , p. 4). More specifically, it can be thought of as a cluster of semantically and/or encyclopedically related concepts or (conceptual) constituent elements . To illustrate, many actions and situations involve MONEY ; the English verbs pay , save , cost , spend , and buy all refer to such occurrents, and relate MONEY to other participants. Figure 3 illustrates this schematically. For example, spending involves MONEY ,a BUYER / PAYER who does the spending, and GOODS or an INTENDED _ EVENT (the thing for which the money is spent).

To qualify as a conceptual metaphor, the mapping from source domain elements onto target domain elements must be systematic : It must be reflected by more than one lexical metaphor. However, most metaphorical mappings are also partial : Not every source domain constituent or relation plays a role in the target domain. The TIME IS MONEY mapping is a good example. When talking about TIME , several, but not all of the situations involving MONEY are conventionally transferred onto situations involving TIME . Conventionalized lexical metaphors including (1) X (3), above, confirm the systematicity of the mapping. Pay and buy , however, are much less conventionalized in a TIME sense; contrast (4) with (1). (4) ?? I paid one hour for that flat tire.

Consequently, not all participants in MONEY situations are prominently present in the TIME domain. Whereas the BUYER / PAYER is mapped onto the person whose time is at stake, and an event that takes time is viewed in terms of GOODS or INTENDED _ EVENT , the SELLER is not usually mapped from the source onto the target domain. The mapping is thus partial, as illustrated in Fig. 4 .

Experiments in child language acquisition and measurements of brain activation zones point to the psychological and biological (or neural) reality of metaphor processing in terms of domain mappings; for a survey, see (Feldman 2006 ). This has been explained by the grounding of the mappings in bodily experience, additionally justifying and motivating metaphor research in the cognitive tradition. However, the HMD project does not make any psycholinguistic claims.
 At the Hamburg Metaphor Database project, we adopted the Conceptual Theory of Metaphor for two reasons, one practical and the other theoretical. First, the researchers involved were most familiar with this theory. Second, the conceptual view invites generalization over different metaphorically used lexical items at the conceptual level. It also facilitates the treatment of frequent, conventionalized metaphorical expressions and rare, novel extensions of existing mappings along the same lines. Thus, it can contribute fruitfully to more metaphorically aware, intelligent NLP systems.
Other well-known theories of metaphor, such as the comparison view (Ortony 1979 ) and the categorization view (Glucksberg and Keysar 1990 ), focus on resemblance metaphors of the form NP copula NP ; such as (5) or (6). (5) Dew is a veil. (6) My job is a jail.

These theories account for analogies between literal and metaphorical meaning by making reference to a possibly open-ended set of semantic features of the nouns, including associations and cultural knowledge. From the computational viewpoint, there are several problems with these approaches. First, it would be tedious to manually itemize semantic features for each attested example in the database, and the data would be less computationally tractable. Second, resemblance metaphors are usually the only instantiation of the mapping they themselves express, and are therefore of little help in formulating generalizations. (Still, some of them can be explained in terms of common, more abstract metaphorical mappings: (6) makes other linguistic expressions.) Third, resemblance metaphors do not exploit the full range of linguistic forms in which conventional metaphors can appear. Neverthe-less, theories other than the Conceptual Theory of Metaphor might be more fitting for a resource with a different purpose. 4 Conceptual information in the Hamburg Metaphor Database Given that conceptual domains can be  X  X  X ny [ ... ] experience X  X  (see Sect. 3 ), almost no theoretical restrictions apply to their names. Cognitive Linguistics has paid relatively little attention to the standardization of labels for conceptual mappings, WAR , etc.) are usually named consistently, following (Lakoff and Johnson 1980 ).
The Master Metaphor List (MML) (Lakoff et al. 1991 ) contains probably the most comprehensive inventory of metaphorical mappings and illustrative examples. In spite of its draft status, the list can be considered a reference work: The fixed set of MML domain labels has been used for annotation at the HMD project since its beginnings, and is in use by other resource creation efforts (see Sect. 10 ), as well as in automatic domain mapping detection (Mason 2004 ).

To illustrate, the HMD entries displayed in Fig. 2 , above, instantiate the MML (source). MML supports the mapping with English examples created through introspection, including (7) and (8). (7) To be cool, you have to wear your overalls this way . (8) She solved the problem a different way .
 The HMD project has identified several problems with using the Master Metaphor List as a reference for annotation. The remainder of this section provides an overview of these shortcomings. 4.1 Labeling and specificity level of conceptual domains Initially not designed for language resource creation purposes, the MML uses multiple partially overlapping naming schemes, indicated by cross-references. It also contains mappings at different levels of specificity. Relations between mappings emerge from section headings and lists of mappings arranged into sections for  X  X  X pecial cases X  X  and  X  X  X pecial sub-cases X  X , or rendered as plain enumerations. Although not explicit in the MML, at least the following three types of mapping-to-mapping relations can be distinguished: subsumption, situation-participant relation, and participant-situation relation. Examples of each are given in Figs. 5  X  7 . The term participant designates profiled constituent elements of a situation, including involved
The large number of labeled domain mappings and the relationships between them result in the need for considerable training. Annotators also must decide on the correct level of mapping specificity for a given attestation. As it is always possible to infer the more general MML mapping from a more specific one, they are advised to select domain labels at the most specific level possible. However, it is confusing that some mapping-to-mapping relations consider participants to be more general, whereas others place situations at a higher level. It might also not always be clear which of several specific mappings is instantiated, resulting in the selection of a more general label for annotation. 4.2 Coverage Insufficient coverage by the MML presents a different class of problems. To offer conceptual information on attestations for which the Master Metaphor List does not include a suitable mapping, HMD annotators resort to an additional labeling system using German domain labels. In light of these additional labels, two subtypes of coverage problems in the MML can be distinguished. The first one results in translation divergences between the English (MML) and German domain labels. In the second case, no English domain labels are included.
 To clarify the issue of divergent domain labels, consider the MML mapping DESIRE IS HUNGER , illustrated therein by the English examples (9) and (10). (9) She thirsts for recognition. (10) He hungers for her touch.
 Consequently, in the metaphor database, the usage of French soif - X  X hirst X  in Example (11), on the fall of the Berlin wall, has also been annotated as DESIRE IS (11) A l X  X rigine de ce formidable mouvement : une certaine soif de liberte  X  et
However, HMD annotators were unsatisfied with the subsumption of the lexical item thirst under the domain HUNGER , as proposed by the MML. Therefore, when selecting German domain labels for the annotation of (11), they used the slightly both mappings are intended to cover a more general idea than they do currently. A possible revision of the domain labeling system would be to indicate the mapping as be consistent with the MML, the HMD project has not applied any changes to the domain labels yet.

The second type of domain coverage problem arises when annotators do not find any mapping in the Master Metaphor List appropriate enough for the attestation under consideration. For example, the characterization of actions of sportsmen as magic might be an instance of the specific conceptual mapping GOOD SPORTS PERFORMANCE IS MAGIC , provided in German by an HMD annotator. This conceptual metaphor, mapping two non-basic abilities onto each other, is not included in the MML; consequently, the database does not provide MML labels for the respective examples.

HMD annotations currently use 59 source domain labels and 50 target domain names based on the MML, resulting in 64 distinct attested source-target mappings. Technically, the fields source MML and target MML of the Metaphor table (Fig. 1 ) hold information on source domain and target domain, respectively. German translations or alternatives are listed in the fields source alt and target alt . 5 Metaphor as a source of polysemy: the lexical layer From a purely cognitive perspective,  X  X  X he metaphor is not in the words X  X t is in the conceptual mappings X  X  (Feldman 2006 , p. 207); see also (Lakoff and Johnson 1980 ). However, first and foremost language resource creation concerns linguistic phenomena and instances thereof, possible generalizations, and related data representation issues. In a metaphor database, the merit of lexical metaphors is thus not limited to providing access to conceptual mappings.

The Hamburg Metaphor Database pays particular attention to lexical metaphors as entities of the lexicon, and attestations. The project treats every lexical metaphor as one of the word senses of a polysemous lexeme , whose base form is given in the appropriate field of the Metaphor table. To indicate senses, the resource refers to the French (or German) part of EuroWordNet (EWN), a standard word sense repository. The metaphor database also provides information on the (more or less salient)  X  X mage component X  (Dobrovol X  X kij and Piirainen 2005 ) of the lexical metaphor, which is evoked by consciously attempting a literal reading of the lexeme, a different word sense. There are several approaches to the definition of literal , and the notion has been contentious in the field. The HMD project defines literal in opposition to lexical metaphors; the term thus refers to a vocabulary item designating a concept from the source domain of the mapping.

Let us illustrate the method with the example of the English translation of (11) above, and the two available word senses of the noun thirst in WordNet 3.0 3 , given in (12) and (13). (12) {thirst#1, thirstiness#2} (a physiological need to drink) (13) {hunger#2, hungriness#3, thirst#2, thirstiness#3} (strong desire for some-
The WordNet entry (13) covers the metaphorical meaning illustrated by example (11). For this example sentence, the synset {hunger#2, hungriness#3, thirst#2, thirstiness#3} would thus be entered into the synset met field of the Metaphor table. The literal meaning from which it derives is represented by the synset {thirst#1, thirstiness#2}, which would be the value of the synset lit field. Because of low coverage in EuroWordNet, synset fields in the HMD may also be empty. For example, EWN defines only the literal meaning of the French word metaphorical synset field does not have a value. EuroWordNet coverage will be discussed in more detail in Sect. 9 , below.

The HMD includes only lexical metaphors that have a synchronic literal counterpart. For example, English ardent , although derived from Latin ardere  X  X  X o burn X , is no longer commonly used in its original meaning (literal burning, predicated of hot objects), and would not be treated as a lexical metaphor in the database.

Lexical data in the HMD reflects the systematicity and, to a certain extent, the incompleteness of metaphorical mappings. Many lexical metaphors are part of a system of regular polysemy. This can be seen by comparing all synsets of lexical metaphors that illustrate a given conceptual mapping (e.g. CHANGE IS MOTION ) and its sub-mappings. Interrelating the literal synsets according to their WordNet relations results in a similar domain structure as interrelating the metaphorical synsets (Lo  X  nneker 2004 ; Reining and Lo  X  nneker-Rodman 2007 ). Figure 8 illustrates this for polysemous English MOTION verbs; lexemes with (covered) metaphorical extensions in the CHANGE domain are displayed in italics.

Still, the observed regular polysemy is incomplete. For instance, certain lexemes with word senses in the literal MOTION domain are not conventionally used in a metaphorical sense (e.g. locomote ), and vice versa (e.g. decrease , increase , which lost their literal GROWTH -meanings). At the HMD project, the same phenomenon has been observed for French. Consider the synset {e  X  difice:1 ba  X  timent:1 construc-tion:6}, which can be glossed in English as  X  X uilding (i.e., the product of a building action) X . Whereas the French noun construction has abundant attested metaphorical usages in the THEORY domain, only few such occurrences could be found for e  X  difice in a corpus study (Sect. 6 ), and none for ba  X  timent . The Conceptual Theory of Metaphor predicts partial mappings of conceptual elements, but the incompleteness of the regular polysemy observed at the lexical level is of a different nature. A given conceptual element (e.g. BUILDING ) participates in the conceptual metaphor, but not all near-synonymous lexical units designating this element display a convention-alized metaphorical sense extension.

HMD annotations currently illustrate the metaphorical usage of 294 French lexemes with 1,483 examples and 144 German lexemes with 173 examples, together 438 lexemes. The predominance of French data is due to a recent corpus based extension restricted to French, details of which are explained in the next section. 6 Efficient metaphor search in electronic corpora To systematically collect new data for the Hamburg Metaphor Database, Reining ( 2006 ) set up a French newspaper corpus of approximately 800,000 tokens. The corpus centers around the topic of European Constitutional politics, an abstract topic that invites the use of metaphors to facilitate cognitive accessibility. The European Constitution corpus was converted into a structured XML-style version, sentence segmented, lemmatized, tagged for parts of speech, and imported into a corpus manager; details can be found in (Reining and Lo  X  nneker-Rodman 2007 ).

Reining and Lo  X  nneker-Rodman ( 2007 ) describes the metaphor search strategy, which is summarized here. First, we select a representative and unambiguous lemma of the target domain (in the case study, the proper noun Europe ) and produce a statistical collocate analysis of the lemma. The optimal  X  X  X indow X  X  or span around the lemma, for use with the collocate search and ranking function, depends on language specific structural properties and on the part of speech of the selected lemma. Reining ( 2006 ) set this span to four words on each side of Europe . Results are ranked by Mutual Information (MI) to find salient collocates, whether or not they also occur frequently throughout the corpus. Next, we consider whether the obtained collocates are likely to be used in a metaphorical sense in the vicinity of the selected target domain lemma. The hypothesis is that those lexemes which, in at least one of their usages, designate entities belonging to domains more concrete than POLITICS are likely to be used metaphorically. In the case of the European Constitution corpus, Reining ( 2006 ) screened 46 top-ranked collocates of Europe ( MI C 6) in the result list (i.e., without context) and retained 13 of them as metaphor candidates (see lemmas in Table 1 ).

The next step is to verify the hypothesis by manually disambiguating the metaphor candidates in context, again in a window of ? / -four words from Europe , and to assign possible conceptual source domains to the lexical metaphors, based on these contexts. In Reining X  X  study, twelve metaphor candidates were confirmed as lexical metaphors without any doubt, one ( ruine ) remained slightly ambiguous. The BEING (including subdomains); see Table 1 .

To confirm whether any of the source domains gives rise to a systematic (well-populated) mapping, more (i.e., less salient) collocates from the list are inspected for possible additional metaphor candidates from the same domain. In the case study, the domains BUILDING and MOTION were mapped most consistently, both in terms of the number of candidate lexemes among the first 100 top-ranked collocates of Europe , and in terms of the semantic relatedness between their literal meanings.
At this stage, the list of possible lexical metaphors contains those whose usage has been disambiguated in contexts near the target domain lemma as well as less salient, possibly ambiguous collocates. In the European Constitution corpus, there were six lemmas for BUILDING and five lemmas for MOTION . To extend the list of lexical metaphor candidates, further source domain lemmas can be derived from EuroWordNet by querying and browsing (Reining and Lo  X  nneker-Rodman 2007 ). Finally, the entire corpus is searched for all occurrences of each candidate lemma, without co-occurrence restrictions.
After concordancing the European Constitution corpus for approximately 20 lemmas from the MOTION and BUILDING domains, Reining ( 2006 ) selected more than 1,000 instances of lexical metaphors and annotated them, following HMD conventions. Compared to the previous entire database contents of approximately 540 metaphors, extracted from nine Master X  X  Theses, this is a huge increase, though currently restricted to French. The corpus-based approach has some additional benefits: It can be completed by one person in relatively short time; meta-documentation tasks are well separated from metaphor annotation; and the annotator concentrates on smaller sets of conceptual mappings and lexemes at a time, which is likely to increase annotation speed and consistency. Figure 2 above displays some annotated sentences from the European Constitution corpus contained in the HMD. The lexemes contained in those sentences illustrate a sub-mapping related to the MOTION source domain.

So far, the data collected by Reining is the only subset of HMD data that has been extracted from an electronic corpus. However, in a related project (Simmank 2008 ), the extraction method has been further extended. In particular, more target domain words and multi-words, besides Europe , were used to retrieve collocates. These target domain items were mostly named entities and technical terms, including Union europe  X  enne  X  X  X uropean Union X , UE  X  X  X U X , traite  X  constitutionnel  X  X  X on-stitutional Treaty X , and France  X  X  X rance X . Simmank applied the method to the French corpus that Reining used and to a thematically comparable German corpus of roughly 100,000 tokens. Most importantly, the procedure was refined by formulating regular expressions, involving information on word order and part of speech, to restrict the collocates to selected grammatical functions. Among others, a predicate-argument construction with the target domain item in subject position (14) and a genitive construction with the target domain item in genitive position (15) were used, both of which yielded a high number of metaphorical collocates. (14) a. Fr.: l X  X urope avanc  X ait - X  X urope advanced X  (15) a. Ge.: das Gewicht Europas - X  X he weight of Europe X 
A search method involving syntactic knowledge requires more language specific information than a purely statistical collection method, but seems to yield more relevant collocates and to ease manual disambiguation. For comparison, (Sullivan 2007 ) provides a set of basic grammatical constructions that are widely used to express conceptual metaphors in English. 7 Frequency of lexical metaphors Besides speeding up data collection for the HMD, electronic corpora also facilitate addressing new concerns, one of which is the frequency of lexical metaphors. As a case study, the ratio of literal vs. metaphorical usages of lemmas from the MOTION source domain has been investigated. A similar study (Gedigian et al. 2006 ) reports a metaphor ratio of over 90% for verbs from the source domains MOTION and HEALTH ; this figure is based on more than 4,000 annotations of Wall Street Journal texts (predominantly dealing with the economy), and ignores occurrences annotated as  X  X  X nclear X  X .
Reining and Lo  X  nneker-Rodman ( 2007 ) reports that only one third of the occurrences of MOTION lemmas in the European Constitution corpus (Sect. 6 ) were actually annotated as metaphorical. This discrepancy is surprising, given that both corpora cover highly abstract topics, but can be explained. In particular, during metaphor collection for the HMD, as outlined in Sect. 6 above, any contexts (whether metaphorical or not) irrelevant to the discussion of the European Constitution were excluded from annotation. Consequently, considering the entire corpus, metaphorical usages occur with a frequency of at least 30% (i.e., 401 annotated occurrences of metaphorical usages). However, HMD data does not reveal which of the remaining 920 unannotated occurrences of MOTION vocabulary items had been excluded for relevance reasons, and which because of their literal meaning.

To obtain more meaningful frequency information, the same annotator 4 performed the same task again, this time with the set of occurrences of MOTION lemmas from the European Constitution corpus that had not been annotated. Context length in the annotation file was one sentence, but the annotator had access to the full corpus. The task was narrowed down to sense disambiguation, i.e., no synset or domain label annotations were produced this time. The annotator flagged 493 more occurrences of MOTION words as metaphorical, 78 as literal, and 349 as belonging to a different category ( Other ). The last class includes other word senses (e.g. Fr. direction as  X  X anagement X  instead of  X  X irection, way X ), grammaticaliza-tions (e.g. train - X  X rain X  in the progressive construction en train de ), constituents of multi-word expressions (e.g. aller bon train - X  X o go/proceed fast X ), and non-applicable contexts due to errors in part-of-speech tagging.
Taking into account all 1,321 occurrences, this results in a ratio of 68% metaphorical usages (894), 6% literal usages (78), and 26% other usages (349). Ignoring the Other category, 92% of the occurrences of MOTION domain lemmas in the corpus are metaphorical and 8% literal. This confirms the findings of (Gedigian et al. 2006 ), for a different abstract domain and a different language, and establishes the MOTION domain as a frequently exploited metaphorical source domain. 8 Metaphor annotation X  X ecessarily subjective? Intuitive metaphor annotation might be highly subjective, but Section 3 , above, argues that explicit reference to an established theory should result in more reliable annotation. The objectivity of an annotation task can be approximated by measuring inter-annotator agreement. Therefore, we conducted an experiment using data closely related to, but not included in the Hamburg Metaphor Database. The previously unannotated European Constitution corpus data from the MOTION domain, described in Section 7 above, was annotated by a second annotator 5 , in the same three-way sense discriminating fashion. Results are shown in Table 2 , with values assigned by annotator I represented in the columns and labels chosen by annotator II in the rows of the contingency table. For example, there are 6 instances that annotator I considered to be literal, while annotator II labeled them as metaphor.
Observed agreement, P ( A ), is the average proportion of tagged items on which P ( A ) = 0.9424. However, in Computational Linguistics, the most widely used measure of inter-annotator agreement is the kappa score, j , which corrects for agreement by chance, P ( E ). j is calculated as follows:
There are two popular approaches to calculating chance agreement P ( E ), yielding two variants of j (Di Eugenio and Glass 2004 ). Cohen X  X  kappa j Co (Cohen 1960 ) will be used here. According to Cohen X  X  approach (see also Di Eugenio and Glass ( 2004 ) for formulas), chance agreement for the MOTION annotation task is P ( E ) = 0.4320; consequently,
One of the problems with j is that no strict threshold can be given for  X  X  X ood X  X  agreement, or  X  X  X bjective X  X  annotation tasks. Rather, j should be considered as a more or less strong tendency towards either perfect agreement (1), agreement equal to chance (0), or entire disagreement ( -1). The value of 0.8986 achieved for the metaphor annotation task shows a strong tendency towards 1, and this suggests that the task is objective enough to allow for a reproduction of its results under similar conditions. Although a comparison of j across experiments with different set-ups is not warranted, it could be noted that this result is in line with agreement on  X  X  X tretches of metaphor and other tropes X  X , yielding j scores of 0.82 to 0.85 (Lee 2006 ).

Another problem with j is that it is influenced by the distribution of categories or classes. As explained by Di Eugenio and Glass ( 2004 , 98), when one category However, for a given value of P ( A ), the larger the value of P ( E ), the lower the value of j . In linguistic annotation tasks, distributions are often uneven, as language phenomena do not occur with the same frequency. This is also the case with metaphor annotation in the European Constitution corpus; the class of literal occurrences of MOTION lemmas is much smaller than the other classes. Although this should influence j negatively and therefore not artificially improve the results, it is a good idea to supplement j by other values.

Further information can be provided in the form of agreement figures per category. These reflect percentages and are not chance-corrected. 6 Poesio and Vieira ( 1998 , p. 197) calculate per-class percentage of agreement, based on how often a given category has been involved in a pairwise comparison. With two annotators, the total number of comparisons for each category is the number of assignments to category j by annotator I (column sum for that category) plus the number of assignments to category j by annotator II (row sum). Absolute numbers of agreement are  X  X  X airwise agreement X  X  numbers: the number of tagged items on which annotators agree, multiplied by two. Per-class agreement is then calculated as follows: For the MOTION metaphor annotation (Table 2 ), per-class agreement is given in Table 3 . Additionally, Table 3 shows observed agreement per category j , taking as  X  X  X eference X  X  one annotator l at a time. Annotator-indexed per-category agreement is the ratio between the number of agreements for that category and the number of items annotated for the category by the reference annotator (e.g., with annotator I as reference, the number of annotations is the column total in the underlying contin-gency table (Table 2 )):
All per-class values yield highest agreement rates for the Other class; this is probably thanks to a relatively small number of different senses (types), occurring in a large number of instances. Interestingly, agreement was most difficult to achieve for the Literal class, but this is also the least populated one. Reasons for disagreement can be found by inspecting the instances on which annotators disagreed. For example, the annotators handled expressions within  X  X  X omparison spaces X  X  of explicit analogies such as in (16) and (17) differently: one annotator flagged them consistently as metaphorical, the other as literal. (16) Sans ces re ` gles, c X  X st comme e  X  tre sur la voie publique sans code de la route  X  X  , (17) Ils se comportent parfois comme s X  X ls avanc  X aient en tenue camoufle  X  e.
There are arguments both in favor and against treating such comparisons as  X  X  X  kind of X  X  metaphor (see also Steen 2007 ), and the HMD project will have to decide on an annotation policy as part of more detailed annotation guidelines in the future.
Finally, minimal context length in the annotation file (one sentence) and the possibility of interpreting some sentences, such as (18), both literally and metaphorically, might cause contrasting annotation decisions. (18) Mais quelle route , quelle direction emprunter ? (route, direction)
Thus, annotator decisions might have been influenced by whether the actual meaning could be verified in a larger context. Future annotation experiments will control for this factor more carefully.
 9 Evaluation against EuroParl corpus data Discussing methods developed at the Hamburg Metaphor Database project would not serve much purpose if the lexical data included were either idiosyncratic and rare, or already fully covered by other resources. In this section, the French HMD data is evaluated against EuroParl, a corpus of European Parliament proceedings publicly available in eleven European Union languages (Koehn 2005 ). Although not balanced, the corpus is often used in Computational Linguistics.
 Since much of the current data in the HMD deals with European politics, many HMD lexemes should be found in EuroParl, unless they are idiosyncratic. The evaluation addresses several questions, the first three of which are addressed quantitatively and listed below. Question 4 requires qualitative work; it is introduced and dealt with at the end of this section. 1. How many lexemes described by the HMD occur in the EuroParl corpus? 2. What are the frequencies of these lexemes? 3. Are the literal and metaphorical senses of these lexemes covered by the lexical
For evaluating metaphor data, the French part of EuroParl version 3 (released on 28 September 2007) was downloaded from http://www.statmt.org/europarl/ , toke-nized, lemmatized, and tagged for parts of speech. A list of word-like lemmas (everything that starts with a letter of the alphabet) with frequencies was generated, yielding 26,555 lemmas and over 36 million tokens.

All French lexemes from the HMD were extracted, with the following exceptions. To minimize problems due to differences in tokenization and lemmatization, reflexive verbs and other multi-word units were ignored. Likewise, the frequent lexeme pas , ambiguous between a noun reading ( X  X tep X ) and a negation particle, was excluded. Thus, 279 French lexemes from the database were retained for evaluation.

Table 4 gives an overview of the occurrence of HMD lexemes in the EuroParl corpus. Almost 90% of the lexemes (250 out of 279) occur at least once. Average and median frequencies of these lexemes are higher than the respective frequencies of EuroParl lemmas in general. The metaphor database is thus not overly biased towards lexemes that are rare in the corpus.

Next, the lexemes were sorted according to WordNet coverage categories, as follows: (1) literal and metaphorical sense included in the French EuroWordNet; (2) only literal sense included; (3) only metaphorical sense included; (4) none of these senses included in EuroWordNet. Table 5 illustrates EuroWordNet coverage and the frequency of HMD lexemes from different coverage categories in the EuroParl corpus. EuroWordNet records the literal and metaphorical senses of 84 of the examined HMD lexemes (column 1); however, for 66 lexemes, it does not provide any of these senses (column 4). Furthermore, there are 115 single-word HMD lexemes for which EuroWordNet defines only the literal sense, and 14 where only the metaphorical sense is included (columns 2 to 3). Lemmas from all four categories occur in the EuroParl corpus, with fully covered lexemes having the highest frequency, and lexemes not covered by EWN occurring most rarely. EWN thus provides at least one sense for 213 of the examined 279 HMD lexemes, with the remaining ones exhibiting a lower frequency in the EuroParl corpus. The results can also be formulated at token level. Almost 200,000 corpus tokens of HMD lexemes show the full literal-metaphorical sense spectrum in EuroWordNet, while more than 100,000 corpus tokens are not covered. For roughly 200,000 additional tokens of metaphor lexemes, EWN offers only one of the possible readings.

Having dealt with the quantitative aspects of the corpus data, there is a final, qualitative question to address in the following case study: 4. What is the distribution of literal and metaphorical usages of HMD lexemes in
To investigate this distribution, we obtained one-sentence concordances for six lexemes from three different EWN coverage categories. The lexemes have source domains related to MOTION and cover different parts of speech and frequency ranges. For lexemes with more than 100 attestations, a random sample of 100 was drawn. For each sentence, one annotator 7 decided whether it contained a literal usage of the target lexeme, a metaphorical usage, or a different sense or an ambiguity that could not be resolved within the one-sentence context ( Other ).

Table 6 summarizes the results, arranged by EWN coverage. For each of the lexemes, the table shows its part of speech, an English translation, and the absolute number of occurrences in the French EuroParl corpus. Frequencies of annotation labels are given in relative numbers. This snapshot indicates that many HMD lexemes are used predominantly metaphorically in the corpus. Out of six lexemes, only the noun bateau - X  X oat X  is used literally in most of the cases. Predominance of one of the senses seems quite pronounced in the corpus. Only the noun de  X  viation - X  X iversion X  shows a more differentiated pattern, with almost 30% of the usages being literal and 65% metaphorical.

The results suggest that metaphorical usages of HMD lexemes are not a marginal phenomenon in the EuroParl corpus and that the Hamburg Metaphor Database provides useful complementary information with respect to EuroWordNet. 10 Related work Metaphor and computation can be viewed from many different angles. For example, recent approaches to the automatic detection of metaphorical expressions have been mentioned in the introduction, where some pointers on metonymy resource creation have also been given. Another line of metaphor research concerns the extraction of relevant patterns from electronic dictionaries and lexical databases. This section concentrates on work that is most directly related to the Hamburg Metaphor Database: Subsection 10.1 reports on other metaphor databases, and Subsection 10.2 on annotated corpora. 10.1 Metaphor databases Martin X  X  ( 1988 ) metaphor interpretation, denotation, and acquisition system (MIDAS) is an early system incorporating the tenets of the Conceptual Theory of Metaphor. In the MIDAS knowledge base (Martin 1994 ), literal and metaphorical word senses are enriched with associations, called metaphor maps . For instance, the The latter sense is used in the computer domain, as in (19). (19) kill the running process MIDAS word sense representations contain information on participants (roles). Metaphor maps are defined between senses and between each of the individual participants, where appropriate. Originally, the MIDAS lexicon contained 13 metaphor senses with 35 maps; through machine learning, the system acquired another 36 metaphor senses (Martin 1988 , p. 210). In spite of the small size of the lexicon, Martin X  X  early work suggests that explicit representation of information on metaphorical sense relations and mappings is beneficial for the interpretation of known and unknown metaphorical expressions.

John Barnden created the ATT-Meta databank of mind 8 for the metaphor reasoning system ATT-Meta (Barnden and Lee 2001 ). The databank is organized by conceptual mappings involving or related to MIND as target domain, including (20) and (21).
For each mapping, corpus examples are given in the form of complete sentences, (22) ONCE I X  X  LET THAT LITTLE PIECE OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE FLOAT
Currently, the ATT-Meta project database contains about 1,100 text and 65 transcribed speech examples. Given that ATT-Meta is designed as a reasoning system, as opposed to an NLP system, the database emphasizes conceptual mapping information and is less concerned with the lexical level.

The design of the Italian Metaphor Database (Alonge 2006 ) probably resembles the HMD most closely. Inspired by the Conceptual Theory of Metaphor, the aim is to document Italian metaphorical expressions and to provide data for enriching Italian lexical databases. The database contains 97 conceptual metaphors for Italian; most of them have been provided with a corresponding mapping from the MML. The mappings are exemplified by 473 multi-word expressions and 260 single-word lexical units. Corresponding synsets in an Italian wordnet have been encoded, where available; corpus examples have been added occasionally. In an attempt to address some of the problems with the conceptual domain mappings that the HMD project also noted, Alonge ( 2006 , p. 459) considers the inclusion of relations between mappings. At the time of the report, the only relation type represented in the Italian Metaphor Database was Opposition. Unfortunately, for funding reasons, the work was discontinued before the data could be made available. 10.2 Corpus annotation for metaphor In an attempt to increase the MIDAS knowledge base, Martin ( 1994 ) collected lexical metaphors from the Wall Street Journal corpus. To avoid a line-by-line analysis, he employed two search strategies: (1) directed search for known metaphorical mappings and their lexical instantiations from the MML; and (2) sampling. With the sampling method, six corpus subsets of roughly 12,000 words in total were fully analyzed, producing 515 instances of lexical metaphors, classified in terms of source and target domains. One of the main results of the experiment was that a relatively small number of metaphorical mappings accounted for a high number of lexical metaphors, whereas many postulated mappings were documented only once in the sample. This is consistent with our results on the French European Constitution corpus, where narrowing down the search to the main mappings in the corpus increased the efficiency of lexical metaphor collection, though obviously restricted the variety of the lexical metaphors that were annotated.

In a project aimed at guiding and improving medical education, based on a better understanding of doctor-patient communication, Lee ( 2006 ) had a 42,000-word corpus of relevant dialogs annotated exhaustively by two annotators. First, non-literal language stretches of minimally one clause were identified without providing further analysis; during this stage, non-literal language types other than metaphor were also identified and no attempt was made to distinguish among them. An inter-annotator agreement of 0.82 to 0.85 ( j ) was measured (see Sect. 8 , above), the span corresponding to the period from the beginning of the experiment to the end, when all texts had been annotated. In the second stage, 534 examples were classified using conceptual metaphors from the MML. The metaphorical expressions belonged common. This annotation effort is similar to the HMD approach in that it attaches conceptual labels to identified instances of metaphorical expressions. However, Lee does not report on links to electronic dictionaries or lexical databases. In a different experiment, Lee and other ATT-Meta researchers also identified metaphorical stretches in British National Corpus files; each stretch is labeled for the MML (or other) conceptual mapping it instantiates. 9 Wallington et al. ( 2003 ) provides detailed annotation guidelines, explaining the identification of metaphorical stretches and various metaphor-specific XML tags used.

To develop and evaluate a program that detects lexical metaphors, Gedigian et al. ( 2006 ) annotated more than 4,000 instances of verbs related to MOTION and HEALTH in the Wall Street Journal (see also Sect. 7 ). The verbs were selected from FrameNet (Fillmore et al. 2003 ), a database of English that groups lexical units into semantic frames , schematic representations of conceptual structures. For example, the concept of Cure is a FrameNet frame, defined as in (23) and evoked by nouns (e.g., remedy ), adjectives (e.g., palliative ), and verbs (e.g., cure , ease , and heal ). (23) Cure : A Healer treating and curing an Affliction (the injuries, disease, or
By selecting frames related to bodily experience, including Cure , (Gedigian et al. 2006 ) obtained a set of verbs that was likely to exhibit metaphorical usages in Wall Street Journal texts. In this respect, their work is similar to corpus extraction for the HMD. Gedigian et al. also distinguish between a lexical layer (lexical units from FrameNet) and a conceptual layer (FrameNet frames). However, this information is limited to the source domain, because the actual, contextual meaning of a lexical metaphor is not provided in their annotation. A large-scale annotation project is currently being conducted at VU University of Amsterdam. Following the metaphor identification procedure laid out by (Prag-glejaz Group 2007 ), researchers working with Gerard Steen have annotated approximately 200,000 words from the British National Corpus and 100,000 words from two Dutch corpora (Steen 2007 ). The Amsterdam approach involves reading the entire corpus and, for each single or multi-word token, deciding whether it is used metaphorically. In contrast to the HMD annotation experiment (Sect. 8 , above), concentrating on likely metaphorically used words, but saying nothing about word forms of any other lemmas, the Amsterdam group is producing full-text annotation. In running text, at least 75% of the words are used non-metaphorically (Pragglejaz Group 2007 , p. 18). Thus, following the Pragglejaz method strictly, much effort is devoted to the analysis of non-metaphorical usages. Still, this approach might be fruitful for refining the criteria to identify lexical metaphors. In principle, the method involves explicitly stating the contextual meaning of each lexical item and its literal meaning; however, the statements do not seem to be standardized. For instance, it is not clear whether the annotations are explicitly linked to entries in the dictionaries consulted. Currently, Steen X  X  approach is limited to the lexical layer, but the group is working on a strategy for adding conceptual information. 11 Conclusion and directions for future work With over 1,650 instances of metaphor, annotated at both the conceptual and the lexical level according to a well-established linguistic theory, the Hamburg Metaphor Database is one of the most important language resources in the field. References to external standard resources (Master Metaphor List, EuroWordNet) contribute to reusability and interoperability of HMD data.
 Problems with those standard resources have been pointed out in the paper. The HMD experience has helped delineate some of the difficulties with conceptual domain labels. In a future edition of the database, the project might decide to revise domain information for the existing, annotated data. The revision could be further inspired by measuring annotator agreement on conceptual domains. Obviously, due to the restricted variety of conceptual mappings illustrated by the HMD, it is premature to consider such a revision as a new standard. Instead, a larger number of researchers might jointly develop a consistently structured inventory of conceptual mappings, based on existing metaphor resources for various languages X  X learly a major effort. Alternatively, other metaphor resource creation projects might want to consider semantic frames from FrameNet as a conceptual layer. Most of the frames are considerably more specific than conceptual domains, but FrameNet provides frame-to-frame relations that invite generalizations at different levels.

Regarding the lexical layer, a future edition or extension of EuroWordNet would profit from the HMD to improve coverage and structure. We are currently developing a representation format for HMD data that will facilitate its distribution as an add-on to the RDF/OWL version of EuroWordNet (De Luca and Lo  X  nneker-Rodman 2008 ).

Recent corpus-based data collection for the database resulted in a considerable increase in annotated data. For languages with appropriate resources and tools, implementing a further automated version of the metaphor detection method might be considered. Studies on MOTION show that this source domain is frequently exploited by lexical metaphors in certain abstract contexts such as politics; frequency studies on other source domains will be part of future HMD research. Finally, inter-annotator agreement involving various measures suggests that the identification of lexical metaphors in corpora is not overly subjective, especially when explicitly referring to an established theory. Further HMD plans include the measurement of agreement on lexemes from other source domains.

Finally, we are studying possible application areas for metaphor resources. In case studies on the EuroParl corpus, we found that metaphorical expressions are more likely to receive a variety of translations than literal usages of the same lexeme (Lo  X  nneker-Rodman and Mohit 2008 ), entailing negative effects on automatic cross-lingual alignment. Detecting lexical metaphors and identifying their source and target domains might thus advance various cross-lingual applications.
