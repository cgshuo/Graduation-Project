 Web search using stationary (desktop) computers has become a pervasive activity. The mobile user in need of information, how-ever, faces several problems in his or her quest to satisfy an in-formation need. Mobile devices have small displays, and mobile user interfaces are often less then usable, because they impose the desktop Web search paradigm on the mobile user. We present a wireless search engine based on natural language queries trans-mitted via popular Small Message Service (SMS) text messages. Besides traditional keyword based queries, the system can accept questions or phrases and returns responses that contain likely an-swers (Figure 1) instead of traditional lists of hyperlinks. The additional precision gained from performing a linguistic analysis of the query helps extracting answers from Web pages directly, which requires no navigation. The system is implemented using a NLIR system residing on a server, which can translate questions or phrases into search engine queries or queries to SOAP Web ser-vices, where a gateway mediates between the mobile network and the Internet (Figure 2). Whereas on the desktop keyboard-based search still prevails, we find that in a mobile context question answering techniques can help overcome the output constraints.
