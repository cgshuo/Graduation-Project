 H.3.4 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Systems and Software Experimentation
Due to the explosive growth of the web that has occurred throughout its history, many researchers working on web corpora have begun to move toward distributed, data paral-lel computing. The size of the ClueWeb09 [2] corpus, at ap-proximately one billion documents, is an indication of this. Even limiting the collection to only documents in the En-glish language only halves the size of the collection.
In this work, we describe the collection of information re-trieval algorithms we have implemented using DryadLINQ [8]. DryadLINQ is a data parallel processing system that al-lows programmers to write distributed programs without worrying about the implementation of a distributed sys-tem. DryadLINQ executes programs containing SQL-like Language Integrated Query statements (LINQ) by shipping the computation to nodes in the cluster for parallel execu-tion. The ability to break a computation into many pieces that can be processed on individual machines means that even a small number of computers can be leveraged to re-duce the time necessary to process large collections.
When researchers first obtain a collection of web docu-ments, there is a substantial amount of preprocessing before analysis can commence. The toolkit assists with parsing, link extraction, associating discovered anchor text with the referenced document. Once the document content and links are in a standard format, then further processing can be performed. The toolkit provides implementations of text-based retrieval methods (BM25 [7] and BM25F [9]), query-independent link based scoring functions (PageRank, in-degree, and trans-domain indegree), query-dependent link-based scoring functions (SALSA-SETR [6]). Additionally, the toolkit provides an implementation of shingle based du-plicate document detection [1], n -gram extraction, and a mechanism to build an inverted index.

The algorithms included in this toolkit include both tradi-tional algorithms as well as recent research results. Elements
