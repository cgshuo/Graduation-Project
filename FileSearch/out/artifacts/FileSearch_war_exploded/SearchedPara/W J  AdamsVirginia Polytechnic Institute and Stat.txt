Trust in Knowledge Management and Systems in Organizations. By Maija-Leena Huotari and Mirja Iivonen (Eds.), Idea Group Publishing, 2004, $79.95, 352 pages, 1-59140-126-7 (Hardcover) ISBN 1-59140-127-5 (e-book)
Virtually every respectable publication about knowledge management (KM) includes a statement relat-ing to trust being the necessary key factor that enables knowledge to be shared willingly within an organ-ization. For example, Baumard (1999) discusses trust as a tacit foundation for relationships, organizational understandings, and  X  X  X oral agreements X  X  among colleagues. Elisabeth Davenport has discussed establish-ing  X  X  X wift trust X  X  in virtual organizations (2004) based on the work of Meyerson, Weick, and Kramer (1996) and Jarvenpaa and Leidner (1998). In an essay in Sharing Expertise: Beyond Knowledge Management ,
Hinds and Pfeffer say,  X  X  X eing motivated to share what you know with others requires trust X  X ot only trust-ing those others (something that is diminished with competition) but also trusting the larger institutions within which the sharing of expertise is occurring X  X  (2003, p. 15). And as (Thomas) Davenport and (Lau-rence) Prusak state in their seminal work Working Knowledge ,  X  X  X he role of trust in knowledge transactions helps explain why knowledge initiatives based solely on the belief that infrastructure creates communication seldom deliver the expected benefits X  X  (1998, p. 36).

Now Maija-Leena Huotari and Mirja Iivonen have organized and edited an entire volume devoted to the subject of trust in knowledge management and organizational systems, and there is plenty to write about and reflect on as the authors in this work attest. Trust in Knowledge Management and Systems in Organi-zation goes beyond the standard  X  X  X ow to X  X  works and those that reflect on  X  X  X essons learned X  X  in the KM arena with an approach that is both theoretical and practical. The book  X  s greatest value is the in-depth examination of the trust factor from the standpoint of researchers, librarians, and practitioners in disci-plines ranging from information studies and administrative science to knowledge management, and com-puting. Ten of the sixteen authors represented here are affiliated with Finnish universities as are the editors, so there is a definite Finnish flavor to the work, however, overall, it is not provincial but a collection of writings with an international perspective.

The book is divided into four sections: trust in performing, trust in online communities, citizens  X  trust in institutions, and trust models with essays that should be useful to those interested not only in formal knowl-edge sharing programs but also in organizational systems, virtual teams, e-government, and e-commerce. In the opening chapter the two editors provide an excellent overview of the importance of trust in the man-agement of knowledge-based organizations. This chapter is very well written citing leading authors and thinkers in the field of KM, and it would make a fine core text in a university seminar on knowledge management.

Several of the most intriguing chapters here are those written by the Italian authors. Andreina Mandelli examines the intersection of trust, self-organization, and hierarchies in value networks as well as the oppor-tunities and potential problems of societies that rely on networked economies. Her view is fresh and her theoretical discussion is based on rigorous thinking about trust and its implications in online interactions, both personal and commercial. Mandelli challenges the common view that networked economies eliminate information and institutional hierarchies while at the same time she recognizes that the Internet has intro-duced radical change to the way business is conducted. Mandelli advocates new ways of looking at relation-ships established and maintained online; although the Internet does not eliminate friction, hierarchies, and social oppression, she suggests that it has its own complexities and opportunities, opportunities that can be transformative and powerful if one understands trust in digital landscapes and if one avoids a simplistic, idealized utopian view of connectivity in societies. Mandelli is equally eloquent as she explains self-organ-ization and new hierarchies in complex evolutionary value networks in another chapter.

Falcone and Castelfranchi, often cited by Mandelli, offer  X  X  X  Belief-Based Model of Trust X  X  in their con-tribution to the work. Their aim is to give a  X  X  X eneral/abstract (domain independent) operational notion and model of trust X  X  and one that  X  X  X efines a technical scientific construct, X  X  (p. 307). This socio-cognitive analysis of trust is certainly thought-provoking, especially the sections on trustworthiness and delegation, positive trust and aversive trust, and intentionality, however, the reader is often distracted by the frequent grammat-ical slipups and choppy style (for example, many one sentence paragraphs) sprinkled throughout the text.
The authors can be forgiven the lack of editorial polish, though, because the ideas they present are so interesting.

In reviewing the book, one can see that each chapter has its own strength and investigates trust in its own unique way. Iivonen  X  s chapter on trust building as a management strategy is thoughtful, weaving in the theories of Mintzberg along with her own take on strategic thinking. Blomqvist and Stahle focus on trust and technology discussing the evolution of trust using some cogent examples and anecdotes to bol-ster their ideas. Many readers will also be interested in Oorni, Kaleva, Hirvasniemi, and Kortelainen  X  s chapter on the usability of websites contributing to trust in e-commerce. The chapter does a solid job of reviewing the literature in the area of trust and e-commerce, and it also reports on original research related to the effects of a website and its relationship to trust. Diane Sonnenwald and Elisabeth Daven-port (along with co-author Leo McLaughlin) each present separate papers providing their unique per-spectives on trust in online communities. Sonnenwald writes about cognitive and affective aspects of trust and empirical research conducted in a research and development organization. Davenport and
McLaughlin discuss interpersonal trust in online partnerships, invoking a number of studies on interper-sonal trust and then arguing that infrastructure and process  X  X  X ay be designed to support trustful inter-action X  X  p. 107.

There are no  X  X  X eak links X  X  in this new work on trust and knowledge management. Each chapter holds its own by generally exhibiting fine writing and interesting concepts. Some of the writers base their thinking on empirical research; others are more philosophical. The editors should be commended for seeking out the volume  X  s authors and convincing them to contribute to this work that should be on the shelf of every scho-lar interested in knowledge management.
