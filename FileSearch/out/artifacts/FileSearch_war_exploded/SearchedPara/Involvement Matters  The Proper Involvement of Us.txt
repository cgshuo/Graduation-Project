 WoundLog is a mobile application that enables district nurses to consult dermatologists, while being in the home situation of the patient. Next to communication tools for teleconferencing and multimedia messaging, it also provides a wound logbook service, and presence, location and availability information of various healthcare professionals. In this paper, we describe the applied user-centred design approach, and a conducted user experiment. The results of the experiment reveal that even district nurses with modest (or no) computing experiences can work adequately with WoundLog. Moreover, they expect that using WoundLog will increase the quality and efficiency of wound care.

Design, Experimentation, Human Factors Healthcare, Mobile application, Teleconferencing, User-centred design, User experiment, WoundLog Telemedicine is the delivery of healthcare and the exchange of healthcare information across distances ([9]). Teledermatology is a subspecialty of telemedicine. It encompasses consultations between a patient with a skin disease and/or the primary healthcare provider and a dermatologist for diagnosis and management advice ([9], p.3). Roughly 25% of all visits to medical practitioners encompass skin diseases ([10]). Many skin problems are manifestations of systematic diseases, and can be the conditions ([10], p. xiii). The district nurse is one of the most mobile persons in healthcare (see also [3]). She visits patients and provides them with medical and non-medical care in the intimacy of their homes, i.e., primary healthcare. This prevents expensive treatment in hospitals or nursing homes, i.e., secondary healthcare. The elderly persons a district nurse takes care of frequently suffer from venous leg ulcers, open wounds or fluid retention (oedema), often the consequences of diabetes. Treatment primarily consists of regularly inspecting the wounds and applying compression bandages. The medical teleconferencing and log service WoundLog provides communication tools for both synchronous and asynchronous consultations, i.e. teleconferencing and multimedia messaging ([12]). WoundLog aims to bridge the gap between primary and secondary healthcare. Instead of expensive and exhausting visits from elderly patients to the hospital, WoundLog provides opportunities for effective communication between district nurses at the patient X  X  home and general practitioners and medical experts in the hospital ([5]). In this paper, we describe the development and evaluation of WoundLog from its initial ideas towards user experiments, by applying a behavioural theory driven user-centred design approach. WoundLog is still a prototype and not yet validated for medical purposes. The design of WoundLog is based upon a combined top-down (behavioural theories) and bottom-up (user-centred design) approach. User-centred design focuses on involving users in more stages of design: from initial ideas to introduction in the workplace or market ([1]). Behavioural theories prescribe user behaviour in certain conditions, which can improve design. Our initial idea was to develop a mobile application for communication between primary and secondary healthcare. This should decrease patients X  visits to hospitals and at the same time increase the quality and efficiency of homecare. Applying it to wound care has potential benefits, as most patients with chronic wounds tend to be limited in mobility ([7]). District nurses work individually; they visit patients in their homes, and make various kinds of decisions regarding the patient X  X  treatment on their own, without quickly or easily consulting colleagues or dermatologists. For urgent situations, they use their mobile phones to contact an expert colleague, a general practitioner (GP), or a dermatologist. These contacts are often interruptive and the relevant visual wound information has to be exchanged verbally. In the following sections, first the user interviews and second the behavioural theories are described. Combining both approaches leads to user-interface design and technical implementation of WoundLog. The user-centred design approach started with semi-structured interviews with the relevant stakeholders for wound care: district nurses from the section  X  X iabetes and Wound Care X  and dermatologists ([5]). The goals of these interviews were to identify user requirements for the mobile application, and to align them with existing work procedures to ensure user acceptance. Semi-structured interviews are interviews that are based upon a framework of questions, eliciting open answers. The questions are based upon the USE IT method, which is appropriate for revealing user satisfaction of ICT support in healthcare ([6]). It consists of four determinants that have to be balanced in assessing the diffusion and use of information systems: relevance, resistance, resources and requirements ([6]). All four aspects were operationalised in our questionnaire. In total, nine healthcare professionals were interviewed; seven expert district nurses, and two dermatologists. Each interview took about 45-60 minutes. The series of interviews started with the idea to design a mobile application to support bandaging. Bandaging is relevant for blood circulation, which in turn is an important aspect of wound care. A good blood circulation improves the healing of the wound. In this district, a possible problem was indicated with the quality of bandaging. After 2-3 interviews, it became obvious that bandaging would not be an appropriate subject for ICT support: the pressure of the bandage to the leg cannot be conveyed properly, and bandaging takes too much time (20 minutes per patient). Therefore, the subject changed to wound care. The district nurses indicated that the most important results for relevance were the need for more patient related information in the homes, and being interrupted by colleagues for advice during treatments. Dermatologists expected most relevance from teleconferencing, as it would reduce the hospital visits the elderly person had to pay. The main resistance results indicated that the elderly district nurses had no affinity with computer applications. Moreover, also some patients would be reluctant that computers would be used. Dermatologists put questions to who was going to finance the tele-consults, and to its legal aspects: who is responsible when the wrong diagnosis is made during tele-consults? They all expected that the helpdesk of their own organisation would provide the necessary resources and support for the application. The main requirements identified by the district nurses were the extra available information when advice had to be provided, wound information in a standard format, store pictures and videos for education. The dermatologists also wanted to store the pictures and videos and emphasised a standard format of delivering wound information, and the importance of the quality of the colour of the picture. For example, the colour red might indicate that the wound is healing, while a slightly different colour red might indicate that it is an angry wound. These results were discussed with the seven expert nurses in a feedback session. The overall results of the user interviews are summarised in the following description of WoundLog: Treatment decisions are important for district nurses. Literature provides many theoretical models and experiments on decision-making, in various disciplines. Results from the user interviews indicate that the focus of our research is on treatment decisions, based upon various information sources, e.g., current situation of the patient, patient history, communication support etc. Moreover, district nurses and dermatologists also expect educational purposes for WoundLog. The knowledge encapsulation theory is an appropriate candidate for a theoretical model about information combinations and knowledge development. It states that expertise development in medical settings is about integrating biomedical and clinical information ([17]). Biomedical knowledge has a causal character and is about the functioning and disfunctioning of the human body. Clinical knowledge has an associative character and is about symptoms, classification and treatment of diseases. WoundLog empowers district nurses by providing them information and communication support to improve decision-making and education. Empowerment is defined as the increased intrinsic task motivation manifested in a set of four cognitions reflecting an individual X  X  orientation to his or her work role; meaning, competence, self-determination and impact of the working activities ([15]). The Information Foraging Theory (IFT) ([11]) guided the design of the user-interface. IFT states that people search for information in patches: patches are coherent groups of information. So, the various information sources of WoundLog are provided in patches. IFT is used to align the user interface design of WoundLog with behavioural theories about information seeking. Teleconferencing systems are often medium or service-oriented (e.g., netmeeting). Participants in a conference can tailor their set of media for a conference. Instead of these tailorable participant-based applications, WoundLog is a dedicated patient-based application. Various district nurses visit the same patient, so district nurse based (= participant-based) is not an adequate design solution. Moreover, interviews and workshops with district nurses revealed that the major task they perform in everyday working is taking care of the patient ([5]). Therefore, the patient is chosen to be the unit of design. The most relevant patient information (=history information and multimedia messaging) is always available in the wound logbook, on the left side of the application. The various tasks a district nurse performs are taken as the units of design: task-based patches ([11]). The tabs on the right side of the window present all relevant information and communication support related to a certain task. These tabs/tasks are view wound logbook information, update wound logbook information (reports), teleconferencing, multimedia messaging, and taking pictures ([5]). Figure 1 depicts an overview of WoundLog. The wound logbook (web interf ace) is the central element in WoundLog. For each patient, the status information and relevant communication about the wound X  X  recovery process is always available. The most recent information is on top. It is marked when a district has read the information in the wound logbook. Besides the dedicated WoundLog application, the wound logbook can also be viewed as web page (reporting and teleconferencing are not possible). So, dermatologists in the hospital can view the wound pictures from any pc. To overcome problems with confusing patients, the picture, name, number and address information of the current patient are always available. Besides the always-available wound logbook information, the district nurse can use four task-based tabs to interact with: teleconferencing, multimedia messaging, taking pictures, and reporting to the wound logbook (see Figure 1). In the following paragraphs, each task-based tab is described in detail. To start a teleconference, the district nurse selects whom to contact. She gets an overview of all possible candidates, ordered by function, and their current presence, availability and location status. She selects the relevant expert, and starts a teleconference. In the meantime, she points her camera at the wound and views at her local video image whether this is the appropriate view for the expert. When he accepts her call, they share the patient X  X  wound log, the camera view and have audio communication. To send a message, the district nurse selects the addressees from a list. She fills in the subject of the message, the report form with predefined relevant wound information and the patient X  X  physical condition, and her question to the addressee. Besides, she can also add some wound pictures to the message. Automatically a copy of the message is stored in the patient X  X  wound log. The answer to this message is also automatically stored in the wound log. Irrespective of the day of the answer, this message is stored next to the question, as it is about the same information. Figure 2 depicts the  X  X end a message X  task-based tab on the right side of the WoundLog window. Figure 2: Overview of WoundLog multimedia messaging (in To take a picture, the district nurse takes her camera and starts a local video. When the appropriate information is on the screen, she can push the  X  X ake a picture button X  and a thumbnail of the picture is presented at the bottom bar of the window. All pictures taken in this patient-based session, are stored in the bottom-line picture bar, and are available across all tabs. The district nurse can decide to use those pictures for all kinds of actions, e.g., add to message and add to wound log. She can also delete pictures from this bar. Figure 3 depicts the  X  X ake a picture X  task tab on the right side of the WoundLog window. In both cases, the wound logbook on the left side is always available. Figure 3: Overview of WoundLog teleconferencing (in Dutch) To report on the patient X  X  status and the progress of the wound, the district nurse can store a wound report accompanied by relevant pictures to the wound logbook. The wound report is exactly the same form as the wound report information of the messages: pre-defined items about the wound and the patient X  X  physical condition. A district nurse conducted a cognitive walkthrough ([8]) with the initial design of WoundLog. This resulted in some adjustments on the used terminology. The navigation between the four tabs was adequately. WoundLog is a distributed application using both client-server and peer-to-peer connections. Figure 4 depicts the overall software architecture (adapted version of [3]). Two types of clients are available to users; a mobile client or multimedia pc and a desktop pc. The dedicated WoundLog application runs on a mobile client for the district nurse and multimedia pc for the doctor in hospital. The desktop pc only allows access to the web interface of the w ound logbook. It does not support teleconferencing. The medical service server hosts several systems. For more details on the technical design and implementations see [3], [12] and [13]. When the district nurse visits patients in their homes, she first has to assess the patient X  X  situation. Possible treatment decisions and corresponding actions of the district nurse are: District nurses indicate that such a decision is based upon the patient X  X  medical background, e.g., diabetes, cause of wounds, and the patient X  X  current situation, e.g., wound colour, fever, nutrition, and pain level ([5]). A skilful treatment decision of the district nurse is relevant to the quality and efficiency of the delivered healthcare. If the delivered something else, the sooner the treatment plan is adjusted, the sooner the patient will be cured. District nurses are not allowed to adjust the treatment plan, only dermatologist and general practitioners are. Therefore the decision of the district nurse to contact the doctor is crucial to the patient X  X  healthcare, or as Perednia says: it is relevant to let a dermatologist look at the right skin problem at the right time ([10]). The main hypothesis in this experiment is that using WoundLog improves the healthcare performances of district nurses. Healthcare performances are the quality and the efficiency of the delivered care and the patient-friendliness. This hypothesis has been refined in a set of three hypotheses, which are tested in this experiment. These hypotheses are related to wound history information, and the use of the WoundLog application for both single-user and multi-user tasks. Hypothesis 1 : History-based wound information improves the treatment decisions of district nurses. Hypothesis 2: Visual information sharing (teleconferencing) improves treatment decisions of district nurses. Hypothesis 3: Technology is not an interfering factor for treatment decisions of district nurses. Next to these hypotheses, the generic exploratory question to this experiment is: What is the district nurses X  opinion about the user acceptance and applicability of WoundLog in everyday practi ce? Identification of treatment decisions of district nurses is tested in an experimental setting with a 2x2 mixed design. The independent variables are medium and information support. The two media conditions are the use of WoundLog and conventional methods for both single-user and multi-user tasks. Conventional methods are the means district nurses nowadays use for communication: mobile phones and paper. The two information support conditions are related to wound history information; available or not. All district nurses had to work with all media conditions (within subjects). The availability of wound history information depended upon media condition. Patient material (18 in total) is randomised across conditions, and all district nurses got each patient only one time to judge. So, the availability of wound history information per patient varied between district nurses (between subjects). All the district nurses had to perform both single-user and multi-user tasks with authentic patient material. The patient material is authentic and consists of a description of the current situation of the patient as a district nurse visits him at home; case description, a colour picture of the wound, and a report on the patient X  X  condition and wound information (see Figure 5). The available wound history information consists of history reports on the patient X  X  condition and wound information. An expert district nurse composed 18 sets of patient material for the experiment. The material originates from patients in her district, Internet and wound care pharmacist companies. This expert district nurse rated the patient material as, 6 normal treatment, 6 semi-urgent treatment, and 6 urgent treatment. To validate the ratings of the expert district nurse, an experienced district nurse also rated all patients material on treatment decisions; normal, semi-urgent and urgent. Interrater reliability (Cohen X  X  Kappa) is a measure for the amount of agreement on the ratings, corrected for the amount of agreement expected by chance. The measured Cohen X  X  Kappa is 0.25. This low figure of interrater reliability means that the ratings of both district nurses do not match. The cross table of both ratings shows that the main difference stems from the semi-urgent category (see Table 1). The second district nurse rated only 2 patients as semi-urgent, which were rated by the first nurse as normal and urgent. The lack of agreement between the district nurses, as reflected in a low Cohen X  X  Kappa, is a serious source of concern. It indicates that treatment decision-making varies a lot between district nurses, and it might even indicate that treatment decision-making based upon the ratings of district nurse 1, these ratings are the frame of reference for the treatment decisions in the experiment. Ten sessions with two district nurses each were c onducted. During a 3 hours session they performed both single-user and multi-user tasks in randomised order, supported by 2 media conditions (WoundLog and mobile phone or paper), and with or without wound history information. The single-user tasks are about treatment decisions supported by wound history information; treatment decisions had to be made with or without wound history information, provided in both a conventional way (paper) and WoundLog (use of the wound logbook). The multi-user tasks are about communication between two district nurses supported by mobile phones, or by WoundLog (teleconferencing). Two district nurses start a conference on the treatment decision of the patient. Treatment decisions are a choice task. Based upon the patient information, a choice has to be made; the patient situation is normal, semi-urgent or urgent. At the start of each session, the district nurses had to complete questionnaires with generic questions (age, experience and computer use). Furthermore, they conducted a pre-test questionnaire about the quality, contribution and the status of the healthcare performance indicators, i.e., quality, efficiency and patient-friendliness in healthcare. Moreover, they also got a set of questions about their decision-making in their real-life practices. Figure 6 depicts an overview of the tasks and questionnaires, between brackets the amount of cases per condition. Figure 6: Overview of experimental tasks and questionnaires During the single-user tasks, the district nurses not only had to complete their treatment decisions, they also had to indicate their perceived complexity of each case. During the multi-user tasks, both district nurses communicated about the patient, and after that, they each completed their own questionnaire about treatment decision and case complexity. Furthermore, each district nurse completed questions a bout their perceived mental workload ([19]), the co-operation and decision-making. After having performed all the tasks, they had to complete a set of post-test questionnaires. First, they had to conduct a questionnaire about the quality, contribution and the status of healthcare performance indicators, assuming they could use WoundLog. Second, they got some questions about their decision-making in their real-life practices, again assuming that they could use WoundLog in everyday practice. Empowerment was a specific topic, and operationalised according to Spreitzer ([14]). Third, the user acceptance of W oundLog is measured by a questionnaire based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) ([16]). Finally, questions were posed about the perceived positive and negative aspects and perceived profit and hindrance of using WoundLog. Twenty district nurses participated in the experiment (19 female and 1 male). Their average age was 44 years, standard deviation (sd) is 11.7. On average they had 10.5 years experience as a district nurse (sd=8.1). 70% of these district nurses uses a computer on a regular basis (daily till weekly) and 30% hardly ever uses a computer. Computers are used for Internet, e-mail, word processing and games. Only 1 district nurse was familiar with video conferencing. The treatment decisions (= choice task) of the district nurses in all conditions were compared to the frame of reference (see section 3.1.2). If the decision was similar to the frame of reference, a 1 was scored. If there was no similarity, a 0 was scored. Due to the between-subjects design of the experiment, not all the district nurses judged all cases under the same circumstances. Therefore, the data could not be ordered by district nurses, but were ordered on case level. Therefore, the scores (0 and 1) per case were counted and divided by the amount of treatment decisions for that case. Paired samples t-tests were conducted to compare all experimental conditions of this parametric data. Moreover, also the standard deviation (sd) of the treatment decisions was taken into account. The bigger the standard deviation, the bigger the distribution of the decisions; the more diverged decisions were made. Comparing the sd of the experimental conditions should indicate the coherency of the decisions. Hypothesis 1 : Wound history information This hypothesis states that history-based wound information improves treatment decisions of district nurses. To test this hypothesis a comparison was made between treatment decisions that were based upon and without wound history information. The paired samples t-test showed that although the mean of decisions based upon wound history information (mean=0.593) were higher than without history information (mean=0.537), there was no significant difference between those decisions (t=-0.454, df=8, p=0.662). Furthermore, the standard deviation (sd) of the treatment decisions was taken into account. The sd for decisions based upon wound history information was 0.27, and without history information was 0.34. These results reject hypothesis 1; wound-history information does not improve treatment decisions of district nurses. Although, there might be more coherency in the decisions based upon wound history information. Hypothesis 2 : Visual information sharing (teleconferencing) improves treatment decisions of district nurses. To test this hypothesis a comparison was made between treatment decisions that were based upon teleconferencing with WoundLog (=video conferencing), and with a mobile phone (=audio conferencing). The paired samples t-test showed that although the mean of WoundLog (mean=0.533) was higher than the mean of mobile phone (mean=0.267), there was no significant difference between those decisions (t=-1.803, df=9, p=0.105). Also the standard deviation (sd) of the treatment decisions was taken into account. The sd for decisions based upon video conferencing was 0. 34, and audio conferencing was 0.43. Audio and video conferencing is a multi-user task. In the experiment a couple of two district nurses completed these tasks together. After having finished the teleconference, each district nurse had to give her own treatment decision of the patient (which was the topic of the teleconference). The treatment decisions of each c ouple were compared. For audio conferencing (mobile phones) 15% of the treatment decisions differed between the two nurses, and for video conferencing (WoundLog) 34% of the treatment decisions differed. These results reject hypothesis 2; visual information sharing (teleconferencing) does not improve treatment decisions of district nurses. Moreover, there might be fewer coherencies in the generic decisions based upon WoundLog, probably caused by the less overlap in the decisions made by each c ouple in the conference. Hypothesis 3: Interference of technology This hypothesis states that technology is not an interfering factor for treatment decisions of district nurses. To test this hypothesis two comparisons were made; between paper and wound logbook and between mobile phone and WoundLog. The paired samples t-test of paper and wound logbook showed that although the mean of paper (mean=0.594) was higher than the mean of wound logbook (mean=0.462), there was no significant difference between those decisions (t=1.830, df=17, p=0.085). The paired samples t-test of mobile phone and WoundLog was already described in the previous section. It showed that although the mean of WoundLog (mean=0.533) was higher than the mean of mobile phone (mean=0.267), there was no significant difference between those decisions (t=-1.803, df=9, p=0.105). Again, also for these conditions, the standard deviations of the treatment decisions were taken into account. The sd for decisions based upon paper was 0.32, and wound logbook was 0.23. Once more, the sd for decisions based upon WoundLog was 0.43, and mobile phones was 0.34. Mental workload was measured during the multi-user tasks (WoundLog and mobile phones), using the Mental Effort Scale BSMI ([17]). Mental workload was indicated on a scale from  X  X o teleconference. The mental workload for both audio and video conferencing tasks was between  X  X ittle effort X  and  X  X onsiderably effort X  On the BSMI, these verbal concepts are connected to numbers from 0 till 150. On average, audio conferencing was 51.5, and video conferencing was 48.6. A paired samples t-test showed that there was no significant difference in perceived mental workload between audio and video conferencing (t=0.635, df=19, p=0.533). These results confirm hypothesis 3: technology is not an interfering factor for treatment decisions of district nurses. Besides, the trend in coherencies in decisions supported by technology instead of convention methods is not univocal. Healthcare performance indicators In pre-test and post-test questionnaires, the perception of the relevance, own contribution and status of the healthcare performance indicators was evaluated. The healthcare performance indicators are quality and efficiency of care and patient-friendliness. The pre-test was about perceptions of the current situation; as the district nurse experiences in everyday practice. The post-test questions were about perceptions as the district nurses were already working with WoundLog in their everyday practice. To identify the effect of the use of WoundLog on quality of care, the results of the pre-and post-test were compared. The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test showed that there were significant differences between the pre-test and post-test for the district nurse X  X  contribution (Z=-2.0, p=0.046) and the status of the quality of care (Z=-3.36, p=0.0001). They expected that both their own contribution and the overall status of the quality of care would improve when using WoundLog. Similar results were found for efficiency of care. The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test showed that there were significant differences between the pre-test and post-test for the district nurse X  X  contribution (Z=-3.17, p=0.0001) and the status of the quality of care (Z=-3.79, p=0.0000). They expected that both their own contribution and the overall status of the efficiency of care would improve when using WoundLog. Finally, the effect of WoundLog on patient-friendliness in care was measured. The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test showed that there were significant differences between the pre-test and post-test for the perceived importance (Z=-2.0, p=0.046) and the status of the patient-friendliness in care (Z=-3.36, p=0.0001). The assumed stable factor importance of patient-friendliness in care had changed between the pre-and post test. After 3 hours of judging case material, the district nurses found patient-friendliness more important than before. They also found that using WoundLog has a positive effect on patient-friendliness. These results show that district nurses expect positive effects of using WoundLog on their own contribution of quality and efficiency in healthcare, and a positive effect of the status of the quality and efficiency and patient-friendliness in healthcare. Decision-making in practice Decision-making is the most important construct used in this experiment. The comparison of the various treatment decisions is described in the previous section. Questionnaires were conducted on the constructs quality of decision-making and personnel empowerment by technology supported decision-making. Empowerment relates to the meaning, competence, self-determination and impact of the working activities ([14], [15]). The district nurses had to indicate their agreement with 10 statements on the constructs on a 5-points Likert scale; 1= totally disagree, 2= partially disagree, 3= neutral, 4= partially agree, 5= totally agree). They partially till totally agreed that WoundLog improved their decision-making in practice (average=4.354; sd=0.75), and almost partially agreed that WoundLog improved their empowerment (average=3.90; sd=0.87). These results indicate that district nurses think that using WoundLog will improve decision-making in practice, and empowerment. Decision-making in co-operation After each patient-based conference (6 in total), both district nurses had to complete questionnaires about their mutual understanding and their decision-making process during the conference, i.e., decision-making in co-operation. Mutual understanding is operationalised in the questionnaire as understanding the case and each other. Decision-making processes are operationalised in questions about quality, contribution and agreement with this process. Again they had to indicate their agreement with statements on the constructs, following the same rating scale. In both mobile phone and WoundLog teleconferencing, they partially agreed that the mutual understanding (of each other and the case) was g ood; mobile phones (average=4.161, sd=1.098), WoundLog (average=4.238, sd=1.129). Their agreements with quality and their contribution to the decision-making process were lower than their mutual understanding: mobile phones (average=3.625, sd=1.55), WoundLog (average=3.752, sd=1.559). The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test did not show any differences between the individual questions of the perception of the mutual understanding and decision-making process of both mediated situations: mobile phone and WoundLog (p&gt;0.057). These results show that both mutual understanding and the decision-making process are perceived positively, but not differently in conventional and WoundLog conferences. User Acceptance User acceptance is measured by an adapted version of the UTAUT questionnaire ([16]). UTAUT measures the acceptance of new technology by identifying the intention of use of this technology. The relevant constructs for the intention of use in this experiment are performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence. Figure 7 depicts these constructs and their relations. The UTAUT questionnaire consists of 15 statements on which the district nurses had to respond on a 5-points Likert scale; 1= totally disagree, 2= partially disagree, 3= neutral, 4= partially agree, 5= totally agree). The performance expectancy of WoundLog was rather high (average=3.54, sd=1.21). This means that district nurses intend to use WoundLog as they expect it improves their efficiency and productivity. Moreover, also the usefulness of WoundLog (part of performance expectancy) was rated high. Also the effort expectancy of WoundLog was rather high (average=3.68, sd=0.96). This means that district nurses intend to use WoundLog as they expect it to be easy to use, and their interactions will be skilful. The social influence of using WoundLog is rated on the positive side (average=3.08, sd=0.75). Again, this means that the district nurses intend to use WoundLog, b ecause they expect s upport from their management and colleagues for using it. Although, more social support can be provided. These results designate that district nurses have positive intentions to using WoundLog, mainly based upon the performance and effort expectancy. The support from management and colleagues for using it can be improved. Applicability In the post-test questionnaire, the district nurses had to respond to statements on the positive and negative effects of WoundLog when using it in practice, Again, responses were on the 5-points Likert scale. The main results revealed that 80% of the district nurses expected a positive effect of WoundLog on the quality and efficiency of wound care, 70% a positive effect on client-friendliness, and 50% a positive effect on education and knowledge of the nurses. Considering the negative effects and hindrances of using WoundLog in practice: 50% of the district nurses expected problems with patient acceptation and technical issues (mainly camera handling), and carrying and taking care of the mobile application (65%). No district nurse expected a negative effect of using WoundLog on the quality of wound care. These results indicate that the main expected positive effects of using WoundLog are the quality and efficiency of wound care. Client acceptation and camera handling and taking of the apparatus are the main expected negative effects. In this paper, a user-centred design approach is described of a mobile application to support the chain of communication between primary and secondary healthcare. The design of the WoundLog application is guided by behavioural theories and dermatologists. Its basic functions are to view and report wound logbook information, to provide information about the presence, location and availability of various healthcare professionals, and to synchronously and asynchronously communicate about patient X  X  wound information. Finally, a user experiment with district nurses is conducted, to test whether this new ICT improves the quality, efficiency and patient-friendliness of the delivered care. Analysis of treatment decisions under various ICT conditions shows no effect of using WoundLog. Analysis of questionnaire data indicates that district nurses expect a lot from the new technology: both quality and efficiency of healthcare will increase. The main hindrance for introducing WoundLog in practice might come from technical aspects (camera handling) and patient acceptance. So, in the believes or judgements of the district nurses, there is a value in WoundLog, but not one to be counted: it is rather a value that counts, but not numerically. WoundLog is still a prototype and not yet validated for medical purposes. User-centred design relates to involving users in all phases of design ([1]). Applying this approach resulted in a usable and well-appreciated application. However, the results of the treatment decision-making tasks showed that the information and communication support did not actually improve decision-making. These results might indicate that knowledge encapsulation was not finalised during the experiment, or that the adopted user-centred design approach was not sufficiently adequate for expert behaviour. Both explanations are described below. In relation to knowledge encapsulation [17], the district nurses are qualified experts in wound care. From skill-acquisition or cognitive learning strategy theory is known that learning goes from cognitive behaviour, via associative behaviour to autonomous behaviour ([1]). The experiment took only 3 hours in which they had to learn a new application and to integrate history-information into their decision-making model. Likely, the time was too short to reach the effect that the new information was already encapsulated in their behaviour. Moreover, the district nurses might have focused their attention from the main task (treatment decision-making) to the new task: learning and handling the application. Especially, because 30% of the district nurses had modest to no computing experiences and using WoundLog does not decrease healthcare performance. The conducted user-centred approach consisted of interviews and workshops with experienced district nurses. As such experts work on routines, their information needs and preferences might be hard to verbalise. Likely, treatment decision-making is applying a fast and frugal heuristic ([4]). The provided information support is not offered in such a way that it fits the existing decision-making process, which is a possible explanation of the results of the treatment decisions. However, the subjective results revealed that the applied user-centred design method is adequate for a usable and acceptable application. So, when designing information and communication support for experts, the user-centred design approach should be extended with cognitive task analyses of covert (and hard to verbalise) behaviour, in combination with interviews and observations of overt behaviour. Empowering district nurses with better tools for information and communication should increase the utilisation of their knowledge and abilities. The results indicated that they feel partially empowered by the ICT support, and their own contribution to the quality and the efficiency of care is increased. Empowering experts by providing ICT support seems a useful construct to directly increasing performances through increasing their intrinsic motivation. District nurses believe in the positive effect of WoundLog on the quality, efficiency and patient-friendliness of wound care. These positive feelings in the appropriateness of WoundLog will motivate them to use it in practice, which might serve as a catalyst for using WoundLog to its full potential. The goal of our user interviews was to ensure user acceptance of the mobile application by identifying the user requirements that fit existing work procedures. The user acceptance was positive in this experiment. As even district nurse with modest to no computing experiences provide the same results as computer experienced colleagues, the ease of use and usability are also adequate. The district nurses, who participated in this experiment, all worked for the same homecare organisation. Compared to other home care organisations, a very large number (200) of district nurses was qualified to deliver wound care. As a result, they do not deliver wound care very often (0-5 patients per week). Other organisations have a dedicated team of district nurses (5-10), continuously educated by a dermatologist to deliver that care. The variance in treatment decisions might also be an indicator for the organisation to re-design their system; educating dedicated teams of district nurses for wound care is likely to be adequate to using WoundLog to its full potential. When moving the WoundLog application to its next phase: pilot experiment in a dedicated district, emphasis should be pl aced on technical aspects and patient acceptance. The camera s hould be replaced by a wireless easy one. The patients s hould be well informed about the impact of WoundLog, less exhausting visits to the hospital, and a chronological overview of their own wound healing process for motivation. The research is part of the PhD project Cognition in Context , and conducted within the research project Pilot Wireless Care (https://doc.telin.nl/dscgi/ds.py/View/Collection-7001) performed by Telematica Instituut and Twente Institute for Wireless and Mobile Communications (WMC) in assignment of the city of Enschede.
