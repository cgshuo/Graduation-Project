 Little work has been done towards an integrated statistical model for understanding webpage structures and processing natural language sentences within the HTML elements. This paper proposed a novel framework called WebNLP which enables bidirectional integration of page structure under-standing and text understanding in an iterative manner. Experiments show that the WebNLP framework achieved significantly better performance.
 I.5.1 [ Pattern Recognition ]: Models-Statistical Algorithms, Experimentation Natural Language Processing, Webpage Understanding
The World Wide Web contains huge amount of informa-tion. Extracting structured Web information about real-world entities (such as people, organizations, locations, pub-lications, products) has received much attention of late [3, 4]. However, little work has been done towards an integrated statistical model for understanding webpage structures and processing natural language sentences within the HTML el-ements of the webpage. Our recent work on Web object extraction has introduced a template-independent approach to understand the visual layout structure of a web page and to effectively label the HTML elements with attribute names of an entity [6].
 Our latest work [7] introduces a joint model of Hierarchical Conditional Random Fields (i.e. HCRF) [6] and extended Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields (i.e. Semi-CRF)  X  The work is done when the author is visiting Microsoft Research Asia.
 [5] to leverage the page structure understanding results in free text segmentation and labeling. In this top-down inte-gration model, the decision of the HCRF model could guide the decision of the Semi-CRF model. However, the draw-back of this top-down model is apparent: the HCRF model could not use the decision of the Semi-CRF model. Without a mechanism to leverage the text segmentation and label-ing results of Semi-CRF, not only the page structure under-standing model could not be improved further using these semantic labeling results, but also the text features with se-quential label dependencies could not be shared among the multiple mentions of a webpage.

It is natural to close the loop in webpage understanding by introducing a bidirectional integration model. We pro-pose a novel framework called WebNLP which enables bidi-rectional integration of page structure understanding and shallow natural language processing in an iterative manner. The WebNLP framework closes the loop of information flow in webpage understanding.

The main contributions of this work are as follows: 1. We introduce a novel framework for webpage under-2. We introduce the multiple occurrence features to the 3. Shallow natural language processing features are ap-
An overview of the WebNLP framework is shown in Figure 1. We can see that the WebNLP framework consists of two components, i.e., a structure understanding component and a text understanding component. The observations of these two components are both from the webpage.

We first use a VIsion-based Page Segmentation (VIPS) ap-proach to segment a webpage into visually coherent blocks [1]. The structure understanding component assigns labels to the vision blocks in a webpage, considering visual lay-out features extracted from the webpage and the segments returned by the text understanding component together. The text understanding component segments the text string within the vision block according to the statistical language features and the label of the vision block assigned by the structure understanding component. The two components run iteratively. Such iterative optimization algorithms can boost both the performance of the structure understanding component and text understanding component.

As we introduced before, the state-of-the-art models for structure understanding and text understating are HCRF and Semi-CRF respectively. However, there is no way to make them interact with each other in their original forms. Therefore, we extend them by introducing additional pa-rameters. We extend the HCRF model by introducing text segment feature functions with the segmentation of the text strings as their input. The Semi-CRF model is extended by introducing both the label of the vision node and the seg-mentation results over all vision nodes in the last iteration.
We apply our algorithm on Chinese named entity extrac-tion from webpages for a social network research project, where the most important named entities are PERSON and ORGANIZATION name. The webpages are crawled auto-matically from news sites and organization websites. We select 133 pages containing multiple mentions of the same entity. These pages include news pages, biography and per-sonal homepages. We randomly sample 33 pages for training and leave the rest for testing. We train the weights of the statistical language features of WebNLP on a large corpus. We use the MSRA Chinese named entity corpus containing 23,182 Chinese sentences for training.

We compare the results from the traditional named en-tity recognition algorithm and WebNLP. We use the name NLP to refer to the model used for Chinese named entity extraction proposed in [2]. The evaluation criteria are the standard Precision, Recall and F1 measure.

The extraction results of different algorithms are reported in Table 1. We can see that both the precision and the recall of the Chinese NER task are improved by using the proposed WebNLP framework. Especially, the recall is increased sig-nificantly. For example, for PERSON, the recall of the NLP is only 54.4%, but the recall of the WebNLP is 79.0%, which is increased by nearly 50% compared to NLP. Totally, the re-call of the two types of Chinese Named Entities is increased from 55.8% to 76.8%, and the F1 measure is increased from 62.1% to 74.5% by using the WebNLP framework.

Since Chinese grammar is very flexible, NER models trained on Chinese language corpus always suffer from the flexibility of the language when working on irregular text in webpages. Fortunately, there is usually more regular text than irregu-lar text in a same webpage. The decision on irregular text, e.g., the title of the news reports and short comments to the news, can be improved by those on regular text, e.g., the content of the news reports. The WebNLP framework enables such improvement by connecting the multiple men-tions of the same entity in the extended CRF model.
In this paper, we introduced the WebNLP framework for webpage understanding. It enables bidirectional integration of page structure understanding and text understanding. Specifically, The WebNLP framework is composed of two models, i.e., the extended HCRF model for structure under-standing and the extended Semi-CRF model for text under-standing. The performance of both models can be boosted in the iterative optimization procedure. The auxiliary cor-pus and the multiple occurrence features also contribute to the improvement of the performance. [1] D. Cai, S. Yu, J.-R. Wen, and W.-Y. Ma. Block-based [2] A. Chen, F. Peng, R.
