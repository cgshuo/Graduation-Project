 1. Introduction
Search is an important way to access the ever growing amounts of information available on the Web, but it is rarely a stand-alone activity. Instead it is typically part of a complex process to accomplish some larger task.
As a result there has been a paradigm shift in the design of search systems to support the larger task rather than to only provide information that matches the user X  X  query keywords. The increasing research interest on
Exploratory Search ( Marchionini, 2006; White, Kules, Drucker, &amp; Schraefel, 2006 ) is part of this shift.
However, the rich interaction between user, system, and information space in the Exploratory Search makes it a challenge for system evaluation.

In this paper, we advocate a model-driven approach where existing user behavior models are used to inform the evaluation process. This approach belongs to the family of formative, user-centered evaluation methods, though it differs in that its focus is more on users X  processes than on a specific system design. Since researchers are still trying to understand the nature of the exploratory search and the design space of systems to support it, the focus on process allows us to gain better understanding of the interaction between users and systems, and to find the missing components in existing designs. In this paper we will present how a sensemaking model informs a formative evaluation of a basic exploratory search system.

In an exploratory search, the searcher lacks knowledge about the topic of interest. Therefore, instead of simply looking up information, she needs to explore more broadly through a complex process consisting of multiple searches and other information activities. Consider a hypothetical example of exploratory search: Ying, a newly arrived student, wants to choose a bottle of wine for her friend X  X  birthday. Since she comes from
China, this traditional European drink of fermented grapes is fairly new to her. She wants to learn more about it, and turns to a Web search engine, starting with a general query,  X  X  X ine. X  X  As she begins to make sense of the list of query results and what she finds on some introductory pages, she discovers there are various interrelated subtopics of interest. These might include the history of wine, the winemaking process, wine growing regions, varieties of grapes, and the pairing of food with wines. Ying makes a list of subtopics she wants to learn more about, then formulates more specific queries on those subtopics and proceeds to make sense of each in turn. As her knowledge of wine grows, she finds some wines appropriate as birthday gifts. She takes notes on those wines and conducts searches on each of them. Her explorations continue in search X  X nderstanding X  X ecision-making cycles until she feels she has enough knowledge to pick a wine for her friend at a local store. Notice that what Ying acquires in this exploratory search process is not a single nugget of information that will resolve her information need. Instead many different nuggets about wine will be of interest, as well as things that are not nugget-like at all  X  namely an overall representation or framework for understanding the general topic of wine (e.g. there are important subtopics like wine growing regions, pairing of wines with foods, wine-making processes, ... ). This process involves many activities, such as information seeking, organization, anal-ysis, decision making, etc. The complex nature of the exploratory search makes it a challenge to design and evaluated an exploratory search system.

Researchers from various disciplines, including Information Retrieval, Library and Information Science, and Human Computer Interaction, have started to lay out the design space for systems that support this kind of exploratory search ( White, Kules et al., 2006 ). Two of the earliest systems were SuperBook ( Egan et al., 1989 ) and ScatterGather ( Cutting, Karger, Pedersen, &amp; Tukey, 1992 ). Subsequent systems, like the ButterFly ( Mackinlay, Rao, &amp; Card, 1995 ), SketchTrieve ( Hendry &amp; Harper, 1997 ), Cat-a-Cone ( Hearst &amp; Karadi, 1997 ), DLITE ( Cousins, Paepcke, Winograd, Bier, &amp; Pier, 1997 ), and NaviQue ( Furnas &amp; Rauch, 1998 ) became increasingly graphical to more richly represent, and thereby support, the complex interaction pro-cesses. More recent systems, including the Open Video Digital Library ( Marchionini &amp; Geisler, 2002 ), Fla-menco ( Yee, Swearingen, Li, &amp; Hearst, 2003 ), Stuff I X  X e Seen ( Dumais et al., 2003 ), mSpace ( Schraefel,
Wilson, Russell, &amp; Smith, 2006 ), etc., have continued the pattern of exploratory search systems focusing, not primarily on the search algorithms of classical interest to Information Retrieval of decades past, but on ways to support interactive, dynamic exploration processes that play out between the user, the software sys-tem, and the information sources in a task context.

The design of exploratory search systems does not focus mainly on the search algorithms of classical interest to Information Retrieval a decade or more ago. Instead, it focuses on ways to support interactive, dynamic exploration processes that play out between the user, the software system, and the information sources in a task context.

Evaluation is a necessary step to get feedback on current system design and to gain insight for future system design. The transition from classical IR X  X  algorithm-centered design to the user-and-process-centered design needed to support exploratory search has demanded new evaluation methods. The Cranfield model ( Clever-don, Mills, &amp; Keen, 1966; Cleverdon, 1991 ) with its focus on relevance and the derivative notions of precision and recall, is no longer sufficient. The success of an exploratory search system does not depend simply on how many relevant documents will be retrieved for a given query. Success depends more broadly on how well the system helps the user with the exploratory process, and the complex interactions needed to make sense of their current problem.

Many researchers have consequently urged new approaches for evaluating interactive search systems ( Bel-nini, &amp; Geisler, 2002; White, Muresan, &amp; Marchionini, 2006 ). The NIST-sponsored Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) has in recent years run the Interactive Track that studies user interaction with text retrieval systems ( Dumais &amp; Belkin, 2005 ), and the HARD Track that leverages information about the searcher and search con-text in evaluation ( Allan, 2003 ). In these tracks, studies examined various interactive processes and interfaces in text-retrieval tasks, and assessed not only the outcome but also the interactive process. Some sample studies are those of Belkin et al. (2001, 2003) and Craswell et al. (2002) . These efforts have been immensely valuable for providing comparisons between (and motivating research on) interactive IR systems. However the pre-defined tasks, the highly controlled search process, and the heavy focus on query construction hinder the adoption of such evaluation in the even more ill-defined and extremely interactive domain of exploratory search.

In contrast, the HCI field has a long history of a user-centered approach in both design and evaluation of extended interactions between humans and computers. In information access contexts, many researchers emphasized the user-centered evaluation approaches ( Dervin &amp; Nilan, 1986; Saracevic, 1995 ), which are  X  X  X on-cerned with how well the user, the retrieval mechanism, and the database interact [for] extracting information, under real-life operational conditions X  X  ( Borlund, 2003 ).

HCI researchers distinguish between summative and formative system evaluations. Early empirical HCI work in the 1980s drew heavily on cognitive and experimental psychology and ran highly controlled experi-ments with large numbers of subjects and careful quantitative measurements to do comparative evaluations of systems yielding solid summaries of their effectiveness. In practice, such  X  X  X ummative evaluations X  X  continue to be very important at the end of a design process, since they support subsequent classical managerial deci-sions reasonably well. ( X  X  X f we buy this system, it will let our employees work 25% faster, with 40% fewer errors than before. X  X ) Many researchers have examined the effectiveness of systems in accomplishing certain larger tasks. For example, a study on the Superbook system examined how well the system supports an  X  X  X pen book essay X  X  task ( Egan et al., 1989 ). Chen, Houston, Sewell, and Schatz (1998) examined how their ET-Map system supports both browsing and search tasks. Yee et al. (2003) investigated the use of faceted categories in image search and browsing tasks. Pirolli, Card, and Van Der Wege (2003) examined how the Hyperbolic Tree Brow-ser supports certain  X  X  X rowse-off X  X  tasks. Qu, Furnas, and Walstrum (2006) studied the effectiveness of a sense-making system in supporting relationship exploration tasks. Since the outcomes of exploratory search are task-specific (e.g. a short essay, answers for comprehensive questions, etc.), different measurements are adopted for different tasks. Human judges are often involved in evaluating the quality of the task results ( Egan et al., 1989; Qu et al., 2006 ). User X  X  self-reported satisfaction is also used as a way to evaluate the effectiveness of an exploratory search system ( Yee et al., 2003 ).

However, by the early 1990s it was becoming clear that summative evaluation was fairly unhelpful in the early stages of design, when there are vast numbers of design choices, both large and small, and the designers have yet to make sense of how the technology, user and task will all work out. The studies that are needed are still  X  X  X valuations X  X  in the sense that they must appraise what is going on so as to guide future action, yet there is no simple clear variable to measure and no single decision (buy vs. not buy) to be made. Instead so-called  X  X  X ormative evaluations X  X  use more qualitatively rich data to allow for a more emergent, structured picture of what is happening with a design in a rich interactive context, and to indicate what might be done for improvement.

The development of exploratory search systems is still in a very early stage, and we believe these formative evaluations are of particular value ( Qu &amp; Furnas, 2006 ). They help us to understand aspects of the interactive process in an exploratory search and will reveal promising directions of exploration in the design space. We seem to have company in this belief: descriptive, formative examinations of the explorative search process are not uncommon in evaluations of existing exploratory search systems ( Chen et al., 1998; Dumais &amp; Chen, 2000; Dumais et al., 2003; Egan et al., 1989; Kules, 2006 ).

In this paper, we propose a model-driven evaluation approach, which we believe is particularly useful for improving the understanding of the exploratory search process and the complex design space. The exploratory search, and the behaviors and cognitions it subsumes, are very complex, and there are emerging theories of the underlying human behavior that can be brought to bear, helping to focus the formative evaluation effort. The behavior models can guide the evaluation by providing some basic understanding of the nature of the com-plex, dynamic exploratory search process, an understanding that concerns different tasks, users, systems, and information sources. Existing cognitive or behavior models relevant to exploratory search, such as various information seeking models ( Bates, 1989; Belkin, Oddy, &amp; Brooks, 1982; Ingwersen, 1996; Kuhlthau, 1991;
Wilson, 1981 ), an information foraging model ( Pirolli &amp; Card, 1999 ), and sensemaking models ( Dervin, 1992; Russell, Stefik, Pirolli, &amp; Card, 1993 ) can serve this purpose.
 There are four benefits of conducting evaluation under a framework of a cognitive or behavioral model.
First, behavior models can shorten the evaluation cycle. One purpose of formative evaluation is to deepen the understanding of the interaction between users and systems. A carefully selected behavior model, drawing on empirical work and careful theoretical analysis,  X  X  X ump start X  X  this process, providing a basic foundation of understanding upon which the formative evaluation of the user X  X  interaction with the system can build. Sec-ond, the models guide evaluation, telling us what data to collect, what activities to observe, and how to ana-lyze the data. For example, the Bates (1989) famous BerryPicking model highlights the iterative nature of users X  search processes. In a continuing search effort, a user X  X  needs, search strategies, and information sources change, and information is collected in the a-bit-at-time manner. This model can directly inform system eval-uation: collect and analyze data regarding how the system supports the changes of query, strategy, and infor-mation source, and how it supports the synthesis of retrieved bits of information. Third, the model-driven approach shifts the focus of evaluation from a specific system per se to how the important activities or pro-cedures described in the model are supported by the capabilities of the system. Gaps in support for those important activities might be hard to detect if the evaluation focuses only on the current system, especially if the user of the current system is not articulately aware of the lack of support. For example, Information
Foraging theory ( Pirolli &amp; Card, 1999 ) says that users make decisions about where to look and for how long based on prospective judgment of the richness of a  X  X  X atch X  X  of information, often without even realizing they are doing so. A model-driven evaluation using such a theory would look for gaps in supporting users X  abilities to make those judgments well. The behavioral model can also help us to understand the coping strategies users develop when the system does not support certain activities. This can lead to an easy and cost effective improvement of the system by fixing the underlying gap or at least supporting the coping strategies. As a final benefit, aspects of the data that do not fit the model can suggest corrections or extensions to it. This interplay between the development of the model and the development of the system will result in a more thorough understanding of the processes that must be negotiated in the user-system design space, and is an essential feature of model-driven formative evaluation.

So far, we have tried to articulate the need for formative vs. summative evaluation, and have argued for the potential value of model-driven evaluation. The purpose of the remainder of this paper is to illustrate this idea, by presenting an example where, specifically, a sensemaking model is used to inform the system evaluation.
The goal of the study is to get design inspiration by a model-driven formative evaluation process. To do this, we strive to understand the relationship between information seeking and the construction of representations where the centrality of evolving representations comes from the sensemaking model. The model influences the design of the study, by helping identify what questions to ask, and what to examine (In the end, as a side ben-efit the study will also lead to refinements of the sensemaking model itself).

In the next section, we introduce Russell et al X  X . sensemaking model in detail and describe how the model can inform formative evaluation. Following that, we present the formative study of how an augmented key-word-based search system supports exploratory search understood as a sensemaking task. Then we will discuss interesting insights into exploratory search gained from the evaluation and some resulting design implications for a sensemaking-based exploratory search support system. Finally we will summarize the findings and reflect on the evaluation method. 2. Using a sensemaking model to guide formative evaluation of exploratory search
In an exploratory search, there is a lack of knowledge about the information problem, information space structure, and even the needed vocabulary (a symptom not just of  X  X  X ot knowing the right words X  X  but of not even having the right concepts) ( White, Kules et al., 2006 ). In such exploratory searches, queries are embedded in a larger process of bridging a knowledge gap that prevents the user from accomplishing her task. Dervin has called such bridging processes  X  X  X ensemaking X  X  ( Dervin, 1992 ).

Thus we propose examining the sensemaking process as a whole in the evaluation of exploratory search systems instead of just looking at individual searches, or even sets of searches. Exploratory search is not a ran-dom walk. The individual component searches are rationalized by sensemaking efforts that embed them. For a specific model of sensemaking we have chosen that of Russell et al. (1993) . While Dervin X  X  sensemaking model is insightful, inspiring and broadly relevant, that of Russell et al has the benefit of being concrete, proposing a more detailed architecture of sensemaking in terms of subprocesses that create a knowledge representation for the user X  X  given task. We have found this concrete and detailed process model particularly helpful in guiding both evaluation and system design.

Russell et al. (1993) defined sensemaking as  X  X  X  process of searching for a representation and encoding data in that representation to answer task-specific questions X  X . Fig. 1 shows this model of representation develop-ment in a sensemaking process. A sensemaker creates an initial representation which he thinks could capture salient features of the information in a way that support the accomplishment of the task (the Generation Loop : task-driven representation construction). Then he identifies information of interest and encodes it in the rep-resentation, which results in the Instantiate Representations (the Data Coverage Loop ). However, when the sensemaker X  X  understanding of the sensemaking task grows, he may find that the initial representation is not adequate to characterize the sensemaking problem, which may impair the accomplishment of the sense-making task. When this mismatch between his representation and the task (called  X  X  X esidue X  X ) becomes suffi-ciently problematic or costly (in terms of effort), the person is motivated to find a better representation, intending to reduce the cost of task operations (the Representational Shift Loop : residue-driven representation construction). The new representation is then used for encoding information, until sufficient residue builds up and yet a better representation is needed or the task can finally be satisfactorily accomplished. As in the exam-ple of Ying above, to choose a wine for her friend X  X  birthday, she searched for relevant information (in the
Data Coverage Loop ) and architected and built an extended knowledge structure about wine, consisting of subtopics and types of wines (through the Generation Loop and the Representation Shift Loop ). Doing so entails not just exploring the information space, but an abstract and combinatorially large  X  X  X epresentation space X  X  of possible choices of knowledge structures, e.g. what parts of the structure to investigate further, and how various parts fit together.
 The representations referred to here include both Internal Representations in people X  X  minds and External
Representations in the outside world. In sensemaking, like many other real-world cognitive tasks, these work together to help form an integrated cognitive system ( Hutchins, 1996 ). Internal representations can be quickly accessed, created and manipulated, but have capacity limitations and cannot be shared. External Representa-tions serve as both input to and augmentations of Internal Representations, and as auxiliary memory aids.
Moreover, even simple physical and pencil and paper representations afford their own computational power, allowing operations that are often different from those of Internal Representations ( Zhang, 1997 ). In this study, concerns for external representations of accumulating knowledge dominate since they are the main cur-rency of the interface, jointly manipulated by both the human and the machine in the service of the user X  X  tasks, and are the most accessible aspects of the interaction for empirical evaluation.

Russell et al X  X  sensemaking model brings a unique perspective to evaluating exploratory search systems for sensemaking tasks: an emphasis on representation construction. The model tells us that in sensemaking tasks, the central activity is creating and continuously refining structured representations to facilitate the task. There-fore, to evaluate an exploratory search system, it is not enough to examine the search process. Instead we need to pay more attention to how well the systems supports the creation of structured representations, and the most effective roles of search in that larger process.

There have been several efforts to design systems that provide supports for building external representations in an information seeking process ( Baldonado &amp; Winograd, 1997; Hendry &amp; Harper, 1997; Qu, 2003 ). How-ever the lack of understanding of the representation creation process limits further design efforts in this direc-tion. Therefore, we conducted a formative study to examine how users create representations in a continuous exploratory search process and how existing query-to-document match search mechanisms support this pro-cess. We are particularly interested in the source of representation ideas  X  where people get ideas for structur-ing representations and how current system design facilitates gathering those ideas. Guided by the sensemaking model, we collected data on activities related to representation construction and information seeking. The results revealed how people get ideas for representations during exploratory search and led both to userful design implications and to refinements of the Russell et al X  X  sensemaking model. 3. A formative study of exploratory search processes
Informed by the sensemaking model, we conducted a formative study of exploratory search processes, focusing on where and how representation ideas are gathered and the role of information seeking in this pro-cess. As detailed below, in this study participants were asked to make sense of unfamiliar topics using an aug-mented query-based search system. The dynamics of the exploratory search process, especially the representation construction and the information seeking, were captured and analyzed using data from a sys-tem log and investigator X  X  observation notes. Users X  were asked to explain the source of ideas for constructing their representation in an interview. The findings deepen our understanding of how representations are created in an exploratory search process and the relationship between information seeking and representation con-struction in such processes. These insights in turn provide inspiration for future system design.
Section 3.1 introduces the system and study design. Section 3.2 presents the detailed data analysis and results. 3.1. The CoSen system and the design of the formative study 3.1.1. The CoSen system
The CoSen system ( Qu, 2003 ) was used in the study. This system is an experimental prototype developed to explore different design choices and functionalities for a sensemaking supporting system, including various types of searches (e.g. search using a sample document, search using structured set of queries), various ways of facilitating representation construction (e.g. clustering, classification), and various analytic tools (e.g. struc-ture comparison tools).

In this study we were not engaged in a summative evaluation of the performance of some radical new sys-tem design. Instead, we wanted a formative understanding of familiar functionality, in order to suggest new design directions. Therefore, participants were only allowed to use the basic keyword-based search and to manually organize collected information because we are interested in how users create representations using a more traditional search system in an exploratory search, and the role of keyword-based search in construct-ing the representation. The CoSen system was thus used simply to provide an integrated workspace where par-ticipants can search for information and construct representations without switching between different systems. Moreover, the system is fully instrumented for recording various activities that would otherwise be hard to capture in off-the-shelf tools.

A screenshot of the system interface in its simple form used for the study is shown in Fig. 2 . The bottom-left area is for keyword-based query input. The Google API (available from 2002 to 2005, now obsolete) was used to retrieve the search results. The search results are shown in the upper-left sub-window. The user can click on any pages in the results list, whereupon the corresponding full page will be shown in the Web browser on the right hand side. This interface allows the user to view the whole result list and any specific page simulta-neously. Users can also quickly skim through the result pages by using the up and down arrow keys to traverse the list. When the user finds useful information, she can bookmark the page, entering it into the bookmark hierarchy appearing in the upper-left sub-window. Similar bookmarks on a topic or subtopic could be grouped under folders which the user can create and name as desired. Pages and folders can be easily dragged and dropped anywhere in the hierarchy. A note editor (the popup window in Fig. 2 ) allows a user to take notes about the gathered information or the sensemaking task. The notes are saved in the bookmark hierarchy with the bookmarks. 3.1.2. Design of the formative study
The objective of the formative study was to understand where and how people gather representation ideas during an exploratory search process in a sensemaking context, and how familiar keyword-based search sys-tems support this process: Where do people get ideas for constructing their representations? What is the relationship between information seeking and representation construction?
What are the strategies people adopted to gather representation ideas using the tools of a query-based search system? 3.1.2.1. Task: topic comprehension. To achieve the objective, this study adopted a sensemaking task we often see in our daily life  X  a topic comprehension task much like Ying X  X : A person starts with a rough idea of the topic, and gradually gains knowledge about the topic through an exploratory search process. This process involves intensive information seeking activities and often involves the creation of external representations to support the accomplishment of future tasks, such as writing a paper or giving a talk. Our findings based upon such a task should bring insights to exploratory search processes in similar sensemaking contexts.
The generic character of the system we studied suggests that design implications will also be applicable to many other keyword based search systems.

In the task scenario, participants were to imagine they were invited to give a 1-h introductory talk two weeks hence on an unfamiliar topic to an audience of ordinary people at a neighborhood public library.
The participants in our 50 min session were to use the Web to learn more about the topic, to collect and orga-nize information that might be useful, and to sketch an outline for the talk. We gave participants a specific topic comprehension task that required the building of external representation so that we could observe and analyze the creation and growth of their structured representations.

After pilot tests on various candidate topics, two contrasting ones were selected for use in the study: Tea and Everyday Drinks for Old People (called Elderly Drink in this paper). They vary first in the degree of pre-vious sensemaking available on the Web. Tea is a popular topic online  X  there are many websites for it with large amounts of well-organized, high quality and relevant information. By contrast, Everyday Drinks for Old
People has no websites specifically addressing the topic. There are not many Web pages that even talk about both drinks and old people in any manner. Secondly, Tea is a popular and well-formed concept in our society and culture, with common agreement between people. In contrast, Everyday Drinks for Old People brings ambiguity from the words it uses and the way the two component concepts, Everyday Drinks and Old People , combine: Is it about what old people are drinking or what they should drink? Does  X  X  X rink X  X  refer to alcoholic beverages only? We presumed the ambiguities in this second topic might require the participants to redefine or clarify the topic themselves.

These two topics thus represent points near opposing ends of a spectrum of topics from popular to unpop-ular, from well-formed to ill-formed, and from having abundant information to lacking information. We expected their different natures would generate different user behaviors, and should thereby help us under-stand how different characteristics of the topic influence exploratory search processes, and particularly the construction of representations. 3.1.2.2. Participants. In this study, 30 graduate students (13 male, 17 female) from the Engineering School and the School of Information at the University of Michigan were recruited through email. The 30 participants were randomly assigned to the two topic groups ( Tea vs. Everyday Drinks for Old People ).

A screening questionnaire was used to check the participants X  knowledge on the given topic and their search skills. All participants were highly familiar with Web searching, including the use of a variety of sources (e.g. different search engines) and search strategies. They all claimed to be largely unfamiliar with their given topic, ensuring that this would be a sensemaking task for them. 3.1.2.3. Data collection. Data collection focused on the search and representation construction activities. Par-ticipants were asked to think aloud during the task. Notes were taken about what they did and said. When participants finished the task, they were interviewed about how they thought through the problem, especially how they obtained ideas on how to structure their talk outline. All the interviews were audio-taped. At the same time, the CoSen system saved the external representations created during the task and logged the search-ing, organizing, and writing activities of the participants, so that we could do quantitative analysis on the pro-cess of representation construction in the study. 3.2. Data analysis
The data analysis consists of two phases. In Phase I we collected evidence from the observation notes and transcripts of different sources participants had for their representation ideas. The sources were then catego-rized and summarized. The results from Phase I have been reported elsewhere ( Qu &amp; Furnas, 2005 ) and we summarize them below (Section 3.2.2 ) for background. They showed that many ideas for representation struc-turing were found during the interactive search process itself. Therefore, in the Phase II work we report at length here (Section 3.2.3 ), we investigated in detail this relationship between information seeking and repre-sentation construction, using visualizations of log data from the search activities and representation construc-tion activities. Together with the other qualitative data (observation notes and interview transcripts), the
Phase II analyses revealed various search strategies users adopted to facilitate the representation construction, as well as ways the emerging representations guided the search, providing us possible insights into better sys-tem designs. 3.2.1. Representations built during sensemaking
In the study, participants were asked to build two external representations: bookmark structures (compris-ing folders and collected useful Web pages) and talk outlines (comprising different sections of their anticipated talk). The two representations serve different purposes in the sensemaking task. The bookmark structure was built mainly to organize possible subtopics for the talk. It also provided storage and easy access to anything that might be useful later. By contrast, a talk outline served as a hierarchical framework for a sequential pre-sentation, requiring logical continuity between subtopics, and containing certain conventional parts, such as opening, closing, etc.

Although having different purposes, the structures of the two representations were highly correlated. Over-all, there were 146 folders (the Tea group: 93 (64%), the Elderly Drink group: 53 (36%)) created in the book-mark structure. Considering the outlines as hierarchical frameworks of different talk sections, there were 116 top level sections (the Tea group: 68 (59%), the Elderly Drink group: 48 (41%)) (including introduction and concluding sections) in the talk outlines. Among these 116 top level sections, 83 (the Tea group: 55 (66%), the Elderly Drink group: 28 (34%)) of them had corresponding folders in the bookmark structure.

The Phase I data analysis investigated the source of ideas for both representations. In Phase II data anal-ysis, however, we were interested in how people sought ideas for representation construction from the Web. We focused, therefore, on the creation of the folder structure because in most cases, a structuring idea from the
Web was be used in both representations and in our system it was easier to record the representation creation and growth in the bookmark structure. 3.2.2. Sources of structure ideas for representation construction
In the study, the participants were asked to think aloud during the task. An investigator who sat beside the participant observed the participant X  X  activities and took notes on what the participant said and what she did.
In interviews that followed the task sessions, we asked participants where their ideas about structure in book-marks and outlines came from. A coding scheme was developed for the interview transcripts and observation notes using a kind of grounded theory process. Different ways of locating ideas for structuring the talk outline were identified, coded, categorized, and counted.

The Phase I data analysis revealed various sources of structure ideas for representation construction (for details, see Qu &amp; Furnas, 2005 ) The Russell et al X  X  sensemaking model, while acknowledging that representa-tions must be created, had not addressed where or how people gather the representation ideas. We found that people get representational inspiration in several ways. Among them, online data is an important source of new structure ideas. First, participants adopted chunks of existing structure of representation if there were others X  representations for the same or similar problems available (e.g. someone else X  X  online talk outline on the same topic). Second, unorganized, trivial-seeming information triggered structure ideas that helped grow the representations (e.g. a picture of a beautiful ceremonial teapot engendered the subtopic  X  X  X ea cere-mony X  X .). Third, the unavailability of useful information caused re-evaluation of existing representations and sometimes re-evaluation of the whole sensemaking task. For example, the unavailability of information on  X  X  X ea Jokes X  X  caused a participant to delete that subtopic from his outline. The unavailability of information on Elderly Drink caused a participant to change the talk X  X  entire topic to Health Drinks.

In addition to finding representation ideas online, participants also generated suitable representations in a systematic top-down manner, using their existing knowledge relevant to the task. Sometimes they constructed the representation based on knowledge schemas related to the task. For example, people seemed to have a schema for the concept of Tea , containing the most obvious features of the concept, such as history, types, culture, etc. In cases where they did not have ready schemas, they did ad hoc reasoning about the representa-tion step by step. This is how one participant decided on the original outline of his Elderly Drink talk:  X  X  X  didn X  X  have any idea about the topic, so I just tried to think of anything. ... I live with my grandma, so I know old people. They care about their nutrition, they care about their health, and they care about the taste. That X  X  the things ( sic ) I could talk about. X  X 
Both of the Tea group and the Elderly Drink group obtained structure ideas from the information seeking processes and from their existing knowledge. However, it was harder to find appropriate structure ideas for
Elderly Drink than for Tea because of the nature of the topics and the amount and quality of available infor-mation. While the Tea group greatly benefited from good Web resources and existing knowledge schema, the
Elderly Drink group collected ideas triggered by small information facts in the information seeking processes and did more reasoning using their own experiences.

The most interesting finding from Phase I data analysis was that, the participants not only gathered infor-mation nuggets from the Web to add into existing representation structures (in the Data Coverage Loop), they also gathered ideas for structuring representations from the Web (in the Generation Loop and Representation
Shift Loop), which is not mentioned in Russell et al X  X  model. However, it was not clear what the role of infor-mation seeking in gathering ideas for structuring representation was, nor how the search system supports the acquisition of those ideas. Therefore, in Phase II data analysis, we focused on investigating the detailed rela-tionship between information seeking and representation construction, and how current search systems sup-port this process. 3.2.3. Information seeking and representation construction
In Phase II data analysis, a closer investigation of the interplay between information seeking and structured representation construction was conducted mainly by analyzing and visualizing the log data on those corre-sponding activities in the study. The observation notes and interview transcriptions were also consulted to gain understanding of users X  intentions underlying those activities.

The logged activities related to information seeking included query submission, Web page browsing, and bookmarking. Query submission and bookmarking were heavily used in this analysis since they indicated when a round of search started and when useful information was found.

To capture the structure construction activities, ideally, we want to know when a structure idea appeared in a sensemaker X  X  mind, when a corresponding folder was built, or when it was written in an outline. Of these three, only folder creations were logged in the system, and from these the process could be partially recon-structed. For the growth of the outline and the occurrence of structure ideas in the sensemakers X  head, only descriptions without accurate timing were available from observation notes and interview transcripts. There-fore, in the analysis, folder creation was used cautiously as a rough indicator of construction of external rep-resentation, with the following two caveats:
In addition to folder structure, other types of external representation were grown in the study, such as the outline.

A structure idea could be in the user X  X  head long before being externalized and it could be externalized in the outline, as a query, or stored in a single bookmark before appearing in a folder. 3.2.3.1. Interlacing of information seeking and representation construction. As the first step towards understand-ing the relationship between representation construction and information seeking, we wanted to determine whether information seeking and representation construction activities were conducted in discrete stages of the process, or whether it occurred in an interwoven fashion? For example, did users first create all the book-mark folders prior to searching for information to be added to each folder or did users go back and forth (cre-ate a folder, then search information for this folder, then create another folder...)?
To answer this question, we visualized interlacing patterns of the three logged activities: query submission, bookmarking, and folder creation. As mentioned above, query submission and bookmarking were seen as indicators of the information seeking process and folder creations as an indicator of the representation con-struction process. In the example shown in Fig. 3 , the sequence of query submissions and folder creations from one participant are shown in a zigzag pattern. Each high data point is a folder creation event; each low data point is a query submission event. Notice that the X -axis is the order of the activities but not time. Therefore such visualization reveals the ordinal interlacing of folder structuring and information seeking. Ordinal pat-terns, instead of full temporal patterns, were visualized because we were primarily interested in whether the two types of activities (information seeking and representation construction) were interlacing or segregated, and not how fast those sequences unfolded. Moreover, a temporal visualization involves many other activities (e.g. reading Web pages, taking notes, etc.) involved, which makes it harder to identify the interlacing patterns we are interested in. The more descriptive temporal visualization will be used in later sections to examine par-ticipants X  strategies of finding ideas for representation construction.

Fig. 4 a and c shows the sequence of folder constructions and query submissions for each participant (high = folder creation event; low = query submission event). Fig. 4 b and d shows the corresponding sequences of folder construction and bookmarking for each participant (high = folder creation event; low = bookmarking event). T1 X  X 15 represent the 15 participants in the Tea group. E1 X  X 15 represent the 15 participants in the Elderly Drink group.

Different patterns in these diagrams correspond to different interweaving patterns of information seeking and representation construction. A zigzag pattern in the diagram (e.g. subject T1 in Fig. 4 a) reveals a tightly interlaced process of information seeking and representation construction. A low line followed by a high line (e.g. T14 in Fig. 4 a) reveals a single period focusing on information seeking followed by a single period focus-ing on representation construction.

Indeed, Fig. 4 reveals different patterns among different people. Many participants had a tightly interlaced process of folder construction and information seeking (query submission or bookmarking) (e.g. participants 1-8 in the Tea group, participants 1-8 in the Elderly Drink group). For these people, there were micro-level cycles of representation construction and information seeking in the sensemaking process. There were people who did representation construction first without too many information seeking forays (e.g. participants 9 X 12 in the Tea group). In these cases, information seeking mostly occurred after the structure was created. How-ever, all the participants started with the search prior to building folders. There were people who sought infor-mation for some length of time before constructing folders (e.g. participants 13 and 14 in the Tea group, participants 9 X 12 in the Elderly Drink group), though the delay of folder construction in these cases does not mean a delay in acquiring structure ideas. Actually, from the queries they submitted and the interviews after the task sessions, we learned that all these people developed structure ideas and did searches based on those ideas to see if they were appropriate for the talk before they decided to make folders for these ideas.
Therefore the structuring was still interwoven with information seeking activities although the structures were in the sensemakers X  heads in these cases. Some participants did not build any folders (e.g. participants 15 in the
Tea group, participants 13 X 15 in the Elderly Drink group), because only several Web pages were bookmarked and they thought it not worth building folders to organize those pages. However, all participants created structured outlines, whose growth was not captured in the system log.

In Fig. 4 we sometimes see several folders constructed without query submissions or bookmarkings in between them (e.g. participant 10 in the Tea group, Fig. 4 a). These occasions of contiguous folder creations were counted and shown in Figs. 5 and 6 . Fig. 5 shows it was not unusual for several folders to be built after a single query submission, which suggests that a single query may sometime trigger many structure ideas. This is consistent with the finding from the interviews that when a sensemaker found a well-structured website, he could draw many structure ideas from it. At the same time, Fig. 6 shows that there were many fewer contig-uous folder constructions without bookmarkings in between. Since it is very possible that a bookmarking event after a folder creation was related to that folder, Figs. 5 and 6 suggest that there were situations in which the search results from a query not only stimulated several structure ideas, but also provided useful informa-tion for those structure ideas. It also indicates that there were not many isolated structuring periods without any information seeking activities.

Therefore, although there were differences in individual searching and structuring behaviors and there were some cases of contiguous folder creation without information seeking, we still conclude that in general infor-mation seeking is tightly interwoven with structuring activities.

The analysis in this section implies a richer interaction between representation construction and informa-tion seeking, which we will examine more closely in the next section. 3.2.3.2. Interaction between information seeking and representation construction. To understand the role of information seeking in building structured representations, we need to examine the logical or causal relation-ship underlying the ordinal interlacing of representation construction and information seeking. One way to examine such relationships is to match information seeking activities to different parts of external representa-tions semantically so that we can see when a structure idea appeared in queries and when it was built into the external representation. 3.2.3.2.1. Visualization of information seeking and folder construction. In order to identify structure ideas and match information activities to different parts of external representations, the query sequences were chunked and matched to the folders.

For each participant, the query sequence submitted was listed and chunked into different sections of differ-ent search topics. Two doctoral students from the School of Information, the University of Michigan were recruited as judges. They were asked to measure the difference between every two queries in succession using  X  X  X ifference scores X  X  ranging from 0(the same) to 10(the most different), in terms of how different the current query is from the previous one. Correlations of the scores from the two referees for each participant ranged from 0.70 to 0.99 with the average 0.85. The average difference score on each pair of queries was used as the final difference score between them. The query sequences then were then chunked by setting thresholds of the difference scores.

A log analysis tool was developed to visualize the folder construction and information gathering activities, as shown in Fig. 7 . Using this tool, we could show the locality of information gathering activities in the folder structure. Each diagram shows activities from one participant. The X -axis is time; the Y -axis shows the differ-ent folders in a participant X  X  bookmark structure. Except the first horizontal line which is a timeline of all activities that happened in the sensemaking process, each horizontal line corresponds to a folder. A folder line starts at the time point when the folder was built and ends when the task session ended or when it was deleted.
The root folder existed all through the task session. A bookmark saved in a folder is represented as a filled rectangle on the folder line. All the query submissions are shown on the root folder since the system cannot tell for which folder they were submitted. Vertical lines are drawn to show the query chunks. The first vertical line shows when the first query was submitted. After that, a thick vertical line is drawn when a query very different from the previous query was submitted (difference score &gt; =5.0). A thin line is drawn when a query moderately different from the previous query was submitted (5.0 &gt; difference score &gt; =2.5). On average, in the
Tea group, each participant had 5.4 query sections. In the Elderly Drink group, each participant had 6.3 query sections.

In the next step, the match between topics from the queries and those from the folders were identified. Two judges (again two doctoral students from the School of Information, the University of Michigan) were asked to judge the matches between queries and folders. Each marked the matches in tables as shown in Fig. 8 (que-ries in rows, folders in column) for each of the 30 participants. Upon comletion the two referees then discussed their disagreements in their judgments and reached a final accord. Then we checked whether queries in the same section matched the same folder. The answer was yes. All the queries in a query section matched the same folder or matched no folder at all. Therefore we have a match between query sections and the folders.
The matches between query chunk and folders were then manually highlighted as shown in Fig. 9 .Ifa query chunk matches a folder, the line of that folder is highlighted (in bold) in the time period matching the query chunk. Using such visualization, we easily track the searches, shifting focus across the structure. For example, in Fig. 9 we can see that the sensemaker built all the folders in the first query section and then pro-ceeded to query on topics corresponding to these folders during the remaining the time. The dark rectangles on the folder lines show when and where bookmarks were added which tells us where the search results went in the structure. This visualization shows us whether Web pages on the query topic that matched a folder were bookmarked (i.e. the bookmarking dots were on the bold line), or Web pages on other topics were book-marked (i.e. the bookmarking dots were not on the bold line). For this specific participant shown in Fig. 9 , in each query section except the first one, both the querying and bookmarking concentrated only on a single folder. 3.2.3.2.2. The two-way interaction between information seeking and representation construction. The log visu-alizations show the interaction between information seeking and representation construction: existing repre-sentations tuned the search process and participants used query search to seek ideas for representation structure. Although we only show four individual examples below, our description of the behaviors is repre-sentative of the full data set. 3.2.3.2.3. Search processes are tuned by structures. When the sensemaking process started, many partici-pants had the general topic ( X  X  Tea  X  X  or  X  X  Elderly Drink  X  X ) as their only structure idea. They started their task by submitting general queries. Later in the task, after folders were built for subtopics, the participants used the structure to instruct their searches. As one participant said,  X  X  X y folders tell me where I am and what
I X  X  going to search for. X  X  The log data visualization supports this observation. For example, in Fig. 9 ,we can clearly see that after creating the folder structures, the person searched and gathered information for dif-ferent folders in turn. She used the structure to help divide and conquer the task. The existing structure was used as a task management aid in this case. Studying the log visualizations revealed that 10 out of 15 partic-ipants in the Tea group and 4 out of 15 participants in the Elderly Drink had a similar behavior pattern.
Therefore, the structure often tunes search by suggesting directions for future searches, and helps organize the sensemaking activities including information seeking and gathering. This result confirmed Russell et al X  X  sensemaking model in that search is used as a way to find information that can be added into the structure. 3.2.3.2.4. Searches are strategically used to construct representation. We also found that sensemakers some-times got new structure ideas from the Web. In such cases, sensemakers not only searched for information to add into structures, they also strategically used search to explore and validate new structure ideas.
First, searches are used to explore structure ideas useful to the task. This exploration happens when a sensemaker does not have a clear structure for the current problem. Their information needs are to find new structure ideas as well as information related to those new ideas. This type of information need cannot be expressed directly using keyword-based queries. Still queries are generated based on whatever representation the sensemaker has. These queries are not submitted in order to match relevant information. They are used to start a query-initiated exploration process where search results are used as pointers to information patches (websites) with high probability of containing information that fulfilled the unarticulated information need for structure ideas. Then the user follows the pointers to the websites and explores the Web pages in the infor-mation patch from the pointers.
 Keywords related to the general topic or a known subtopic were often used to start such an exploration. Two examples are shown in Figs. 10 and 11 , respectively and confirmed in the interview with the participants.
In Fig. 10 , a participant searched for tea and found a good website on tea . She explored the website, and found many interesting subtopics. Then she built several folders on those subtopics. In Fig. 11 , a participant kept submitting general questions on elderly drink throughout the task session. She followed the link in the search results and from there navigated the Web. She got all her structure ideas during such explorations and found several useful bookmarks for various parts of the structure. Notice that she even broadened the already gen-eral query of  X  X  X veryday drink of old people X  X  to  X  X  X ld people X  X , trying to enclose a wider range of topics in the search results. Broadening is a very useful strategy in exploration. With a more general query, a search is likely to cover a larger information landscape in the search results, though at the cost of losing detailed information.
The log visualizations of 11 participants in the Tea group and 7 participants in the Elderly Drink group showed the pattern of folder creations after a search either on the general topic or on obliquely related sub-topics, which implies possible adoption of query-initiated exploration of structure ideas.

Second, searches were sometime used as a probe to help test or validate structure ideas. One example is shown in Fig. 12 and confirmed in the interview with the participant. This participant had some structure ideas but hesitated to formalize them in external representations. He searched on those ideas to see if there was suf-ficient information available of satisfying quality. He added an idea into his external representation only if the search on the idea was satisfying. Otherwise he abandoned the idea. The log visualizations of 10 participants in the Tea group and 11 participants in the Elderly Drink group showed similar patterns, which implies possible adoption of search as probes to validate structure ideas.

In summary, search tools were strategically used for different purposes in an exploratory search: (a) to explore new structure ideas; and (b) to validate existing structure ideas. In many cases, even when the original intention of a search was to meet a single purpose, people found information that served multiple purposes. For example, a query originally sent to find information for a subtopic, also led to new structure ideas.
Consistent with the findings in Phase I of the data analysis (Section 3.2.2 ), the Elderly Drink group had a harder time constructing representations than did the Tea group. For example, 20 out of 93 folders (21.5%) in the Tea group and 20 out of 53 folders (37.7%) in the Elderly Drink group were built after search on the cor-responding topic. Assuming then these folders were built after validating the structure ideas, this suggests peo-ple had less confidence in possible construction ideas for the Elderly Drink topic. The difference in difficulty of getting structure ideas was also shown in that the Elderly Drink group built folders later than the Tea group.
Participants in the Elderly Drink group started to build folders on average 15 min after the task session started, much later than participants in the Tea group who began to build folders on average 6 min after the task ses-sion started.

From the above analysis, we see a bi-directional interaction between information seeking and representa-tion construction. The existing structure (or structure ideas) shapes the information seeking by suggesting directions for future search and by helping people organize the search activities. Conversely, through various strategies, information seeking brings ideas and material for representation construction. If we consider sense-making as a process of seeking appropriate representation, then there is an information need to find new struc-ture ideas, validate existing ideas, and find information to be added into existing structures. The search system, as an intermediary between the human and the external information world, retrieves information that serves all these different needs. 4. Discussion and design implications
Informed by the sensemaking model, this study focused on examining how people create structured repre-sentations during exploratory search and how a basic search system (the CoSen) supports this process. In Sec-tion 4.1 , we discuss how this formative evaluation deepened our understanding of the exploratory search process, exposed the missing part of the existing design, and revealed users X  strategies to cope with the inad-equacy of the design. In Section 4.2 design implications are presented. 4.1. The information seeking cycle and the sensemaking process
Russell et al X  X  sensemaking model motivated and informed this study by emphasizing the representation evolution in the sensemaking process and provided a concrete framework for the process. We paid special attention to places in the model that lacked the details to lead the evaluation, such as where people get ideas for representation, and the complex relationship between information seeking and representation construc-tion. The study deepened our understanding of the sensemaking process and extended the original sensemak-ing model.

First, the findings extended the sensemaking model by identifying the sources of ideas for representation construction. Other than generating representation structure using their existing knowledge relevant to the task, users also get their ideas for structuring the representation from the outside information world (e.g. the Web). To build those representations, they watch for new structure ideas, or even ready-made chunks of structure, in search results or Web pages navigable from the search results. They also use search as probes to validate those structure ideas.

Second, the findings refine the sensemaking model by presenting the rich interaction between information seeking and representation construction. The two types of activities are tightly coupled. The existing represen-tation shapes the search process, determining, in part, what people search for and when they search for it.
Conversely, the representation is shaped by the search process, as users strategically gather ideas for represen-tation construction and to validate their existing structures.

Third, the findings suggest a variation of the familiar information seeking cycle, one that specifically high-lights seeking of structural-information ( Fig. 13 ). In the framework of Russell et al X  X  sensemaking model, users are trying to create a structured representation that will allow them to accomplish their task. The observation in the study suggests that when that representation is inadequate  X  incomplete or ill-formed generating  X  X  X es-idue X  X  in Russell et al X  X  terminology, a special kind of  X  X  X tructural-information need X  X  arises. This is a need for changing, growing, or validating structures. To satisfy these structural-information needs, users must search their information resources (e.g. the Web), looking for existing structures or ideas for structure instead of dis-crete information piece on the Web.

However, a user X  X  structural-information need  X  a need for structure rather than facts  X  is hard to express using specific keywords. One reason is that the information needs for changing, growing, or validating struc-ture are not simple matters of relevance, and are thus hard to capture using topic-expressing keywords; there is an inherent mismatch between the representation of structure and the structureless bag of keywords that form a typical query. In many cases, diagrams or other graphical representations are more suitable for representing structures than words. Another reason keywords are problematic is that, in exploratory search, when people want to change or grow their current knowledge structure, they may not be able to specify precisely what is needed. Belkin (1980) called such a situation the  X  X  X nomalous State of Knowledge X  X  (ASK), where people  X  X  X ec-ognized an anomaly in their state of knowledge of some topic, but they are unable to specify precisely what is necessary to resolve that anomaly X  X .

Not only is this structural-information need hard to express currently, there is also a lack of effective search mechanisms for finding appropriate structures. The current word-based matching mechanism cannot identify or extract useful structures from the Web. Therefore, the system cannot directly return structures that satisfy this kind of users X  information need even if the need could be represented to the system.
 To cope with these difficulties users develop a strategy to continue their sensemaking tasks using traditional
IR systems based on keywords. They issue some sort of query, usually just general or obliquely related key-words. Search results are returned which provide, not nuggets of information, but pointers into relevant web-sites, which are patches of interlinked and structured information on the Web. In those patches they seek ideas for changing, growing, or validating their current representation structures. They extract structure ideas, either explicit fragments for reuse, or perhaps just general structural inspirations. Search is no longer a means to find information that directly satisfies users X  information needs. Instead, the search leads people to an infor-mation patch where users can explore useful information structures.

This information seeking cycle reveals users X  difficulties in a sensemaking task with evolving representa-tions. To resolve these difficulties, we can either facilitate users X  current search strategy or create new systems that change the current user behavior more fundamentally. In this spirit, Belkin et al. early ASK system pro-posed an alternate IR framework to help users with inexpressible information need. The ASK system helped users extract and represent their information needs from their problem descriptions, helped them choose appropriate search mechanisms, and employed user feedback to adjust the representations of their informa-tion needs. Similarly, to support sensemaking activity during exploratory search, we must develop ways to help people with information needs no simple query can express. However, the unique characteristics of our problem, the need for structural-information, lead to more structure-oriented design implications than the ASK project. We can work, for example, not from initial textual problem descriptions, but from users X  externalized evolving representation structures, and help users find search mechanisms appropriate to their structural-information needs. 4.2. Implications for design
Our new understanding of how people seek information, construct representations, and develop coping strategies for current search system inadequacies gives us insights into redesigning the current search system to better support sensemaking tasks. In this section, we discuss these implications in detail. 4.2.1. Support for expressing structure needs
As mentioned above, the information need for changing, growing, or validating representation structure is hard to express using traditional keyword queries. New need-expression approaches may be able to solve this problem. Basically, the system should be able to capture users X  current representation structure and the intended action, and use them in the search process.

If a person does not have an explicit structured representation, a system might be able to help build a rep-resentation of a user X  X  knowledge structure from the problem statement ( Belkin et al., 1982 ). If a person already has some structured representation, a system might allow direct input of existing representations and the intended action to take on that representation. For example, a user could indicate a node in the exist-ing tree structure and instruct the system to  X  X  X ind possible subtopics X  X . Or a user could indicate a whole sub-structure of the current representation and indicate,  X  X  X ill this part out more X  X , whereupon a corresponding structured set of queries could be submitted at once with candidate results attached appropriately to the user X  X  structure. 4.2.2. Support for finding useful representation structure in the world
To satisfy users X  information need for structures, a search system should be able to take in their existing externalized structure representation and help locate or explore useful structures, rather than just return iso-lated, individually relevant web pages (even those vetted for network prominence, as by PageRank).
New systems could be built to locate existing knowledge structures. For example, a variety of techniques could identify useful structures within a Web page or within a website. Natural Language Processing and
HTML or XML tags could be used to identify Web pages that might have a whole outline of information on Tea for the task in our study. Text analysis and network structure analysis on a website could identify use-ful structures among Web pages. Specific websites, such as wikipedia.org or about.com could also be automat-ically used in the search for pre-existing knowledge structures that users could leverage. The structures can be ranked based on how relevant or complementary they are to users X  existing structure, using techniques to com-pare structures. Pages or websites that contain useful structure could be returned as the search results and users could start with the exploration of these structures. This approach provides support for users X  existing query-initiated exploration strategy. For example, when Ying explores the topic of wine, it would be useful to retrieve pointers to whole sites that organize and cover subtopics like wine history, varietals, food pairings, etc. With the future development of technology, we might also be able to extract the knowledge structure from the
Web pages or websites and present them explicitly to users. These approaches could be useful for popular top-ics such as Tea, which have many relevant knowledge structures available online.

In addition to locating existing structures, systems may be able to automatically generate useful knowledge structures. The system could automatically cluster web pages in search results by semantic similarities. The clusters might reveal some topical structures or trigger some structure ideas. A system could also try to identify clusters of Web pages which are semantically related to each other, but different from each other so as to jointly cover a range of subtopics. For example, using advanced Natural Language Processing technology, we can control content overlaps in the search results, finding sets of pages that have a good balance of overlap and diversity. Such clusters may well contain topic-structuring information that will help sensemaking. When users have existing structures, classification or semi-supervised classification can be used to change or grow the existing structures ( Basu, Banerjee, &amp; Mooney, 2002; Nigam, Mccallum, Thrun, &amp; Mitchell, 2000 ). These approaches could be useful for unpopular topics such as Elderly Drink, which have few relevant knowledge structures available online. 4.2.3. Support for task management
During exploratory search involving sensemaking, information is sought for different parts of the emerging representation. That is, instead of serving a single information need, the users issue a suite of searches serving a structured set of information needs, defined by the evolving representation. That is, the exploration and sensemaking activities themselves had complex structure over time. Users could probably use support manag-ing that activity (This would probably be even more true if users were engaged in tasks that took days or weeks, rather than just 1 h, as in this study).

A system that supports the sensemaking process should help users manage their growing set of information needs and the search processes for each individual need. It should also support the shift of search focus on the structured representation. For example, the system might keep track of a search conducted on each part of the representation and remind users of the status of each of them. A simple example is a highlighting capability for a bookmark hierarchy that would indicate nodes that have been worked on recently or nodes that need more information. 5. Conclusion In this study we proposed a model-driven formative approach for evaluating exploratory search systems. We showed how a sensemaking model provided a framework in evaluating a basic exploratory search system.
The formative evaluation reveals various sources of structure ideas for representation and the tightly coupled relationship between search and representation construction in a sensemaking process, especially how the search is used to explore useful structure ideas instead of pure information facts. The results lead to further understanding of the current use of keyword-based search systems in supporting sensemaking processes and to design implications for current and future systems.
 The model-driven approach benefited this study in the following ways:
First, the model guided our focus of what to examine in evaluation. In this case, the sensemaking model directed our attention to the representation construction in the exploratory search. We measured, not just query generation, but bookmarking and folder generation. We used case-by-case judgments of semantic con-tent to find structure in the query-generation sequence and how it related to bookmarking and folder gener-ation activity. This gave a rich qualitative and quantitative view of how the current system was being used in the exploratory searching and sensemaking.
 Second, guided by a behavior model, the study did not just focus on the performance of a specific system.
Instead, more attention was given to how the task was conducted using the current system and what part of the process was not well supported. We identified the inadequacies of the current system design  X  the lack of support for expressing information needed for structure and for seeking useful structures. Those findings led not only to improvement of the current system design but also possible ideas for new algorithms or systems to facilitate the process.

Third, this approach provides opportunities to check the appropriateness of the underlying model and to refine the model. We report how this work led to an elaboration of the original Russell et al model with regard to sources of ideas for representations and the rich interactions between information seeking and representa-tion construction.

As the evaluation of exploratory search systems shifts its focus from algorithms to a process in a vast design space with various factors (task, user, system, information spaces), new theories and practices are needed to understand the problem space and ultimately provide guidelines for evaluation. This study can be considered one of many such efforts and hopefully reveals some interesting problems and possible solutions in this exten-sive field of research.
