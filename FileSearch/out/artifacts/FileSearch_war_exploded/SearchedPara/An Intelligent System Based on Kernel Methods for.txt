 Clustering is a useful machine learning technique that can capture meaningful pat-terns in the agro-hydrological data. Finding good quality clusters in spatial data (eg, temperature, precipitation, pressure, etc) is more challenging because of its peculiar characteristics such as auto-correlation, non-linear separability, outliers, noise, high-dimensionality, and when the data has clusters of differing shapes and sizes [10, 15, 18]. The popular clustering algorithms, like k-means, have some limitations for this type of data [16, 18]. Therefore, we present a weighted kernel k-means clustering algorithm incorporating spatial constraints bearing spatial neighborhood information in order to handle spatial auto-correlation, outliers and noise in the spatial data. 
A number of kernel-based learning methods have been proposed in recent years [3, transformation that maps the data from their original space to a high dimensional space where the data are expected to be more separable. A simplified view of the problem domain is shown in Figure 1. The data consists of a sequence of snapshots of the earth areas co nsisting of measurement values for vari-ables like temperature, pressure, precipitation, crop yield, etc. 
This work uses clustering to divide areas of the land into disjoint regions in an automatic but meaningful way that enables us to identify regions of the land whose constituent points have similar short-term and long-term characteristics. The spatial and temporal nature of the target data poses a number of challenges. For instance, such type of data is noisy. In addition, such data displays autocorrelation (i.e., meas-ured values that are close in time and space tend to be highly correlated, or similar), high dimensionality, clusters of non-convex shapes, outliers. 
If we apply a clustering algorithm to cluster time series associated with points on the land, we obtain clusters that represent land regions with relatively homogeneous behavior. We can then identify how various parameters influence the climate and oil-palm produce of different areas using corr elation. A simplified architecture of the agro-hydrological system is shown in Figure 2: The kernel methods are among the most researched subjects within machine-learning community in recent years and have been widely applied to pattern recognition and function approximation [2,5,6,12,14,17]. There are instances where a linear hyper-plane cannot separate classes without misclassification, an instance relevant to our problem domain. However, those classes can be separated by a nonlinear separating hyperplane. This concept is based on Cover X  X  theorem on the separability of patterns. 
Let a nonlinear transformation function  X  maps the data into a higher dimensional space. Suppose there exists a function K , called a kernel function, such that, kernels allow large non-linear feature spaces to be explored while avoiding curse of dimensionality. Further, the use of the kernel function is less computationally inten-sive. The formulation of the kernel function from the dot product is a special case of Mercer X  X  theorem [13]. { w hanced by the use of a kernel function. The kernel k-means algorithm can be general-ized by introducing a weight for each point x , denoted by u ( x ), as: where,  X  The Euclidean distance from  X  ( x ) to center w j is given by the following eq. If we adopt Guassian radial basis function (RBF), viz., ) exp( ) , ( K ( x , x )=1. And, writing the last term in eq. (3) as C k . we can get: For increasing the robustness of fuzzy c-means to noise, an approach is proposed in [1]. Here we propose a modification to the weighted kernel k-means to increase the robustness to noise and to account for spatial autocorrelation in the spatial data. It can be achieved by a modification to eq. (1) by introducing a penalty term containing spatial neighborhood information, as: where N k stands for the set of neighbors that exist in a window around x i and N R is the tance in the last term of eq. (5), can be calculated as The expression for effective minimum distance from each point to every cluster rep-resentative can be obtained from eq. (5) using eq. (4) and (6): K ( x i , x j ) will be very small. So, the second term in the above expression will get very by not assigning the point to the cluster. For detail about the algorithm, pls. see [11]. The system is implemented in C++. We get results regarding analyzing various fac-tors impacting oil-palm yield. However, because of space constraints, here we briefly describe the clustering results of the SWK-means algorithm. is used for removing seasonality from the data. For monthly rainfall values for 5 visualization of results, we also applied the algorithm to the monthly average rainfall values of this period. Its results are shown in Figure 3. For the next five year periods of time for the selected 24 rainfall stations we get data matrices as 48 X 60, 72 X 60 and so on. The algorithm proportionally partitioned the data into two clusters. The corre-sponding results are given in table 1 (a record represents 5-year monthly rainfall val-ues taken at a station). It also validates the proper working of the algorithm. tation is gathered. The analysis of these and other time series (e.g., precipitation, tem-perature, pressure, etc) is conducted using clustering. We can then identify how vari-ous parameters, such as precipitation, temp erature etc, influence the climate and oil-palm produce of different areas using correlation. Our initial study shows that the rainfall patterns alone affect oil-palm yield after 6-7 months. This way we are able to plantation and environmental data. Computational machine learning techniques like clustering can be effectively used in analyzing the impacts of various hydrological and meteorological factors on vegeta-tion. Kernel methods are helpful for clustering complex and high dimensional data that is non-linearly separable in input space. Consequently for developing a system for oil-palm yield prediction, an algorith m, weighted kernel k-means incorporating spatial constraints, is presented which is a central part of the system. We get promis-ing results on our test data sets. It is hoped that the algorithm would prove to be ro-oil-palm yield prediction.
