 Dynamic support in adaptive inclusive educational systems depends on properly managing the adaptation in the eLearning life cycle by combining design and runtime adaptations and making a pervasive usage of standards along the eLearning life cycle. My Ph.D research focuses on recommender systems for lifelong learning inclusive scenarios, which have particular differences in their need for personalized recommendations. The research presented here makes a proposal for addressing some of the existing challenges. It goes beyond issues that are usually considered when building recommender systems and focuses also on closing the cycle. In particular, I propose a graphical representation that will help to compare the recommenders X  performance in eLearning scenarios.

The seed of my research comes from the research works undertaken in several projects of aDeNu group. First, at aLFanet project (IST-2001-33288) we came up to the conclusion that adaptations should be applied along the full life cycle of eLearning, and proposed to combine design and runtime adaptations making a pervasive use of standards to support users in the process [1]. The aLFanet approach relates to other projects which are intended to extend existing standards to support adaptive course delivery [2]. Nevertheless, aLFanet focus was to effectively combine runtime and design time adaptations in an open adaptive learning management system based on standards. Our experience in aLFanet proved that adaptation is not an idea that can be plugged in a learning environment, but a process that influences the full life cycle of learning, which consists on the following four steps: 1) Design of the learning experience, 2) Administration of the environmen t, 3) Runtime (where dynamic adaptations based on the users X  inte ractions are offered to learners and tutors), and 4) Feedback to the course author on the learner X  X  experiences. Currently, in EU4ALL (IST-2006-034778) and ALPE (eTen-2005-029328) projects we are analyzing how accessibility requirements are to be considered in the previous approach to provide an inclusive support in lifelong learning [3]. Learners experience a disability when there is a mismatch between the learners X  needs (or preferences) and the education or learning experience delivered [4]. Thus, the system should take into account also the accessibility prefer ences of the learners and the device capabilities when interacting with the system to accommodate this diversity to the content and services delivered. In particular, at aDeNu group we propose the use of recommender systems (RS), where personalized assistant agents know about the users stated needs and learn about preferences and procedures by observing users X  interactions in the deployed services. Recommender technology has traditionally focused on e-commerce activities and is used to select items for the users that may interest them. However, applying these techniques in eLearning scenarios is not a straight forward approach, since the context and specific goals are different. This is the area of research where I have focused my Ph.D due to the open research issues to solve the demands on dynamic support in eLearning scenarios. In particular, my Ph.D goes beyond issues that are usually considered when building RS and focuses also on closing the eLearning cycle. I have proposed a graphical representation to facilitate the comparison of th e recommenders X  performance in eLearning scenarios. eLearning scenarios are subject to different conditions than traditional RS for e-commerce [5]. Instead of providing recommendations mostly based on the users' taste, recommender RS in these scenarios should consid er other criteria. For instance, the preferred activity by a learner may not be pedagogically adequate [6]. Lifelong learning inclusive scenarios promote a user-centered approach thr oughout a persons X  lifetime that removes social, physical and cognitive barriers, where dynamic effectiveness of the learning process. Some of the main particularities are the following [7]: Moreover, what really matters in lifelong learning is not just a particular user X  X  need or preference but the combination of them and more especially, their evolution over time. In this context, recommendations are used to produce a personalized response in those situ ations where the course design offers alternatives to the learner, being some of the alternatives better than the others for the current user. Personalization employs user models, which are changed dynamically by the system, and requires the system to be flexible to adapt to changing circumstances and to mon itor the user behavior in order to adapt it automatically [8]. Drachsler et al. argue that memory-based recommendation techniques are the most adequate for RS in lifelong learning scenarios [5]. In fact, there is not a single recommendation strategy to apply (due to the dive rsity of needs and situations). We propose a hybrid approach to combine collaborative filtering and content based techniques [7], which has been summarized in the following figure. In short, both learners and tutors produce some input (explicit  X  X ia forms-or implicit  X  X rom interaction traces-) in the learning management system (LMS) that is to be used by the RS. The information for the learner is stored in her user model (UM). The professor selects and annotates the contents with metadata. When a request for recommendations is given to the RS, this input is processed by different memory-based techniques (variations of collaborative-based filtering and content based-filtering). Dependi ng on the input, some techniques  X  X r a combination of them X  ma y provide better recommendations than others. The output of this process is filtered by the course context and the user features to produce an ordered list of recommendations adapted to the user and context, which is given back to the LMS to be presented to the user. Based on the works introduced above, my Ph.D research intends to improve the learning efficiency (measured by speed, results and user satisfaction) through the usage of a RS by offering the most appropriate recommendations for the learner in each situation of the course. It considers that dynamic support in adaptive and educational system s depends on properly managing the adaptation in the full eLearning life cycle by combining design and runtime adaptations a nd making a pervasive usage of standards. In this context, the learner is supposed to be supported by the system when performing the required tasks in the environment. These tasks are of diverse nature (e.g. getting in touch, individual work, collaboration, reflection, ...). They can be divided into three types of situations according to the objectives of the tasks performed: i) getting familiar with the platform resources, ii) getting used to the operative framework of the course and iii) carrying out the learning activities of the course using the available resources and following the course design [9]. The goal is to dynamically support the learner by recommending actions that overcome blockage s in the course execution not covered by the instructional design specified by the course author. However, my research interest goe s beyond issues that are usually considered when building RS, namely detecting users X  needs, producing recommendations, tracking users X  interactions and evaluating the benefit of recommendations. It also focuses on closing the cycle and concurs with an increasing interest in providing RS in education [5]. In this sense, it deals with finding out how to provide feedback on the performance by defining relevant parameters that help to understand and compare the response of RS in different situa tions and also the performance of different systems. I have established the following four research hypothesis: The objective of my contributions is to validate the above hypothesis with experimental re sults, assuming a standard-based RS integrated into the open sta ndard-based learning management system called dotLRN [10]. My research works carried out so far address the four steps of the eLearning lifecycle (following hypothesis 1 regarding the comb ination of design and runtime adaptations). From empirical studies such as Mungania X  X  [11] and the experience in the aDeNu resear ch group with eLearning settings [1], [3], [9], I have defined the following eight types of recommendations (hypothesis 2): Initial experiments run [9] have shown that recommendations depend on the situation of the learner in the course. If the learner is getting familiar with the platform, recommendations on  X  X crutability X  or  X  X revious knowledge X  should not be as important as  X  X echnical support X  or  X  X o tivation X . Therefore, a good RS should provide the appropriate r ecommendation of the appropriate type in each situation. How can this RS be modeled in a way that allows an comprehensive comparis on between different situations and different systems? To cope with these issues, my proposal is based on applying techniques from the computers measurement field, in particular, the visual representation called Kiviat diagrams [12]. Kiviat figures are histograms arranged in a circular shape. Usually 6 or 8 spokes (which represent magnitude s measured) are arranged in a wheel and intersect with imaginar y cycles. The rim represents the maximum value of the magnitude. An intersection close to the rim indicates a large magnitude; close to the core indicates a small magnitude. Consequently, a glance at the "shape" of the Kiviat figure resulting from linking the intersections in each spoke can quickly convey a great deal of information about the underlying metrics. Kiviat figures usually represent a static picture; that is, they do not have a time axis, but re present either an instantaneous state (snapshot) or a time-integrated state (summary). In my research proposal, each of the type s of recommendations is in one of the spokes of the diagram. I also identify two different states the learner can be in (snapshots): At this point, the goal of my expe riments is that some types of recommendations are more appropriate than others in each of the two states because they provide a significant improvement of the learning efficiency (hypothesis 3). From these results, I will be in the position of defining what could be a typical behavior of a RS with good performance (i.e. the expected shape of the resulting Kiviat figure). My fourth hypothesis is that the resulting Kiviat figures for the transitory and permanent states may look similar to the following figures. Experiments with a large number of users are going to be run to check if this hypothesis can be confirmed. Following this hypothesis, the results obtained can be translated into a graphical representation that can help to analyze and compare the behavior of the RS and feed back on their performance. Since a better recommender provides better recomme ndations to the learner, the learner efficiency should be improved. To validate this proposal, first I have to validate the RS itself. That is, I have to prove 1) if the recommendations are given in the appropriate moment, 2) if they are useful for the learners to improve their learning effectiveness, and 3) if the learners X  satisfaction with the learning expe rience increses. For this, I will combine explicit data gathering w ith questionnaires to get initial and basic information of the l earner (such as computing her learner styles and interests), and implicit analysis of the users X  interactions, including the anal ysis of correlations between followed recommendations and be tter scoring in the course evaluations. Once these results are obtained, I will run new experiments both at transitory and permanent states to come out with the final Kiviat figures that represent both states. Experiments will use control groups. Evaluations are framed in EU4ALL and ALPE projects, where existing courses are being adapted to follow the proposed approach. I would like to thank my advisor Jes X s G. Boticario for offering me the opportunity to research in these leading and challenging issues. Moreover, I would also like to thank the European Comission and the Spanish Government for funding the research projects in which my Ph.D work is framed and my collegues of aDeNu group for their support.
