 and Efficient Multi-dimensional Range query processing (SEMR) in two-tiered sensed data and encrypt range queries. Observations show that our protocol outperforms previous work in efficiency, accuracy and privacy. A z -dimensional data item D can be denoted by ( d 1 ,...,d z d l is the value for the l-th dimension. We suppose sensor node z v D matrix CV i,j of data D j through matrix multiplication as follows: ST is constructs a query vector q l =(1 , -( a l + b l ) ,a l b l [ a l ,b l ](1 l z ) and builds matrix Q by using query vectors Then the sink transforms Q to TQ through It can be seen that TQ is a 3  X  z matrix. Then the sink sends node ST. While receiving the range query message, ST computing the product p i,j of data d i,j of sensor S i by multiplying CV i,j and l-th row is the range criterion for l-th dimension value. Theorem 1. Let z  X  z matrix P be defined as Equation (3) for data
D . D is in z -dimensional range { [ a 1 ,b 1 ] ,..., [ a z ,b z elements on main diagonal of P are all non-positive.
 Proof. For the l-th element pd l on main diagonal of P , note that Therefore the storage node ST can filter data according to Theorem 1 . Then ST sends the query result to the sink. The complexity of range query process based on SEMR is O ( zn ).
 Our basic protocol SEMR can ensure the result accuracy and process in instance, if the adversary captures the storage node and possibly derives then
M and all actual data can be computed. One way to avoid this vulnerabil-{ r is sign-preserving for P i,j . SafeQ[ 4 ], we implement these schemes and perform communication cost com-parison based on data set LUCE (Lausanne Urban Canopy Experiment) [ 5 ]. nodes. Thus, to avoid extra communication cost for broadcast, we adapt BBP for two-tired sensor network, which is denoted as CBBP (Changed BBP). The schemes are implemented on OMNet++4.1, a widely used simulator for WSNs. The area of sensor network is set to 400 meters  X  400 nodes are uniformly deployed in the network. Assume the network is separated DES as the data encryption for SEMR, SafeQ and CBBP. According to [ 4 ]and SEMR reduces more communication cost, achieves higher efficiency than SafeQ and CBBP. protocol  X  SEMR in two-tiered WSNs. SEMR preserves data privacy, enables of SEMR. Our future work will focus on improving SEMR to detect collusion attacks in WSNs.
