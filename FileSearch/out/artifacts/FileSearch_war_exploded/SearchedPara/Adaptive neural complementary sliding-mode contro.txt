 1. Introduction
A model-based non-linear control, which requires a system tant tool to achieve robust behavior. Since the system may be unknown or perturbed, the model-based non-linear control general, a tradeoff problem between the mathematical model accuracy and the control performance arises in a model-based non-linear control system. If all uncertainties existed in the control plants are bounded, a sliding-mode control system pro-and undesirable chattering phenomenon is resulted to guarantee system stable. The chattering phenomenon becomes the most important disadvantage of a sliding-mode controller. To over-uncertainties estimator is proposed ( Huang et al., 2008 ). An adaptation law is derived to online estimate the upper bounds growing unboundedly.

Many studies on both the neural networks and fuzzy systems integrating adaptive control techniques have represented an alternative design method for the control of unknown or systems are used to approximate arbitrary linear or non-linear the neural networks can learn from data and feedback, the meaning associated with each neuron and each weight in the structure of IF X  X HEN rules. However, the learning capacity of fuzzy systems is less than that of neural networks.
Recently, neuro-fuzzy networks provide the advantages of both neural networks and fuzzy systems, unlike pure neural networks or fuzzy systems alone. Neuro-fuzzy networks bring the low-level learning and computational power of neural net-works into fuzzy systems and give the high-level human-like thinking and reasoning of fuzzy systems to neural networks form the output part of neural network by the non-linear combination of input variables. As a result, there has been et al., 2008 ; Lin et al., 2011 ).

To achieve better learning performance, some researchers to construct a wavelet neural network (WNN) which absorbs the advantages of wavelet decompositions and learning of neural networks ( Billings and Wei, 2005 ; Chen and Hsu, 2010 ; Hsu, 2011 ; Ko, 2012 ). The wavelet functions have the ability to decompose wideband signals into time and frequency domains frequency components and on long time intervals for low fre-quency components. This paper presents a functional-linked wavelet neural network (FWNN) which combines the advantages of the FLNN and WNN. Since the output weights of the proposed FWNN are equipped with a functional-linked type form, the
FWNN is used for function approximation with faster conver-gence rate and less computational loading than a multilayer neural network.

Chaotic system is a non-linear deterministic system that dis-observed in many non-linear circuits and mechanical systems system has become a significant research topic in physics, mathematics and engineering communities. This paper proposes an adaptive neural complementary sliding-mode control (ANCSC) system which is composed of a neural controller and a robust compensator for a chaotic system. The neural controller uses a
FWNN to approximate an ideal complementary sliding-mode controller and the robust compensator is designed to eliminate the effect of the approximation error introduced by the neural controller. The parameter learning algorithm online tune the control parameters based on the gradient descent method and the Lyapunov stability sense. To show the effectiveness of the proposed ANCSC system, a comparison among the complemen-proposed ANCSC system can achieve better control performance than other methods.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the with a FWNN. Then, numerical simulations that confirm the validity and feasibility of the proposed method are shown in
Section 4 . Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 5 . 2. Problem statement
Chaotic phenomena have been observed in numerous fields of can be observed in many non-linear circuits and mechanical systems. Consider a second-order chaotic system such as Chen and Dong (1993)  X  x  X  p _ x p 1 x p 2 x 3  X  q cos  X  o t  X  X  u  X  f  X  x  X  X  u  X  1  X  is the control effort, p controls the size of the damping, p 1 periodic driving force. In this paper, we chose that p  X  0.4, p constants, the solutions of system (1) may display complex chaotic behaviors as Chen and Dong (1993) . To observe the complex phenomena, the time responses of the uncontrolled different system parameters.

The dynamics of a chaotic system are highly time varying and law so that the system state x can track a state command x c and a sliding surface as Wang and Su (2003) e  X  x c x  X  2  X  s  X  _ e  X  2 ke  X  k 2 where k is a positive constant. Next, a complementary sliding surface is designed as Wang and Su (2003) s  X  _ e k 2
A significant result concerning the relationship between s and s can be obtained as _ s  X  _ s ks  X  s c  X  X  :  X  5  X  obtain _ s  X   X  e  X  2 k _ e  X  k 2 e  X   X  x c f  X  x  X  u  X  2 k _ e  X  k 2 e :  X  6  X 
To design an ideal complementary sliding-mode control law, consider the candidate Lyapunov function in the following form as V 1 s , s c , t  X  X  X  yields _ V 1 s , s c , t  X  X  X  s _ s  X  s c _ s c  X  s _ s  X  s c  X  _ s ks  X  s c  X  X   X  s  X  s c  X  X  _ s ks c  X  X   X  s  X  s c  X  X  X   X  x c f  X  x  X  u  X  2 k _ e  X  k 2 e ks c :  X  8  X 
Assuming that all the parameters in (1) are known, an ideal complementary sliding-mode controller can be given as u n  X   X  x c f  X  x  X  X  k 2 _ e  X  ke  X  s  X  X  :  X  9  X 
Imposing the control law u  X  u * in (8) with (9) yields _ V 1 s , s c , t  X  X   X  ks  X  s c  X  X  2 r 0 :  X  10  X  ( s , s time, then it is obtained that Z and bounded, the following result obtains lim
By Barbalat X  X  Lemma, lim mode control system can be guaranteed ( Slotine and Li, 1991 ; Wang and Su, 2003 ). 3. ANCSC system design
The ideal complementary sliding-mode control law in (9) can the system dynamic of control plants. In the most practical systems, the system dynamic is difficult to develop accurately due to the lack of knowledge of system parameters or external compensator, i.e. u where the neural controller u nc uses a FWNN to approximate an ideal complementary sliding-mode controller and the robust between the neural controller and ideal complementary sliding-(1) yields  X  x  X  f  X  x  X  X  u nc  X  u rc :  X  14  X  (14) , an error dynamic equation can be obtained as u n u nc u rc ks  X   X  e  X  2 k _ e  X  k 2 e  X  _ s :  X  15  X  3.1. Network structure of FWNN The network structure of the proposed FWNN as shown in work. The operation functions of the nodes in each layer are introduced in the following.

The output function of each node is given as u  X  d j Y j  X  a T j w Y j , for j  X  1 , 2 , ... , m  X  20  X  Layer 6: The output node together with links connected it act. all incoming signals. The output of the proposed FWNN can be represented as u  X  3.2. Stability analysis
The main property of neural network regarding feedback
It implies that there exists an optimal FWNN such that u n  X  a n T H  X  e  X  22  X  r E with E as a positive constant. Since the optimal parameter is defined as u  X  ^ a T H  X  23  X  and (23) into (15) yields _ s  X  a n T H ^ a T H  X  e u rc ks  X  ~ a T H  X  e u rc ks  X  24  X  imation error e , this paper designs the robust compensator as u  X  8 &lt; :  X  25  X  n  X  [( s  X  s c ), the proposed ANCSC system, two cases are considered separately depending on the value of 9 s  X  s c 9 .

V 3 s , s c , ~ a , ~ 1 , t  X  is the optimal value for 1 as defined 1 n  X  arg min s  X  s c 9 function (32) and using (24) and (28) , yields _ V 3 s , s c , ~ a , ~ 1 , t  X  s _ s  X  s c _ s c  X   X  s  X  s c  X  X  _ s ks c  X  X  X   X  ~ a T  X  s  X  s c  X  X  e ^ 1 T n ks  X  s c  X  X  2  X   X  s  X  s c  X  X  e ^ 1 T n  X  1 n T n 1 n T n ks  X  s c  X  X  2  X   X  s  X  s c  X  X  e  X  ~ 1 T n 1 n T n ks  X  s c  X  X  2  X   X  ~ 1 T s  X  s c  X  X  n  X 
If the adaptation laws is chosen as _ ^ 1  X  _ ~ 1  X  Z B s  X  s c  X  X  n  X  35  X  then (34) can be rewritten as _ V 3 s , s c , ~ a , ~ 1 , t  X  s  X  s c  X  X  e 1 n T n ks  X  s c  X  X  2 stability of the proposed ANCSC system can be guaranteed for 9 s  X  s c 9 r F ( Slotine and Li, 1991 ; Wang and Su, 2003 ). 3.3. Full parameter learning
In order to describe the online training algorithm of FWNN, a cost function is defined as C  X  1 2 e 2 :  X  37  X 
According to the gradient descent method, the adaptive law of the controller parameters can be represented as ( Lin and Lee, 1996 ) _ ^ a  X  Z a @ C @ ^ a cannot be obtained in advance. Therefore, the updating rule cannot work properly during the learning process. Comparing descent method to increase the learning capability, i.e. _ c  X  Z c @ C @ c  X  2 Z c s  X  s c  X  X  a T j w Y j s 2 ij x i c ij  X  39  X  _ s  X  Z s @ C @ s  X  2 Z s s  X  s c  X  X  a T j w Y j s ij x i c ij 2  X  40  X  where Z c and Z s are positive learning rates. 4. Simulation and experimental results It should be emphasized that the development of the proposed ANCSC system does not need to know the mathematical model of parison among the complementary sliding-mode control (CSMC) tions, the step time used to control the system is 0.002 s.
First, the CSMC system ( Wang and Su, 2003 ) is applied to the bound of the system uncertainty is usually considered. The simulation results of the CSMC system with small uncertainty bound for q  X  2.1 and q  X  7.0 are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 , respectively. The tracking responses of state x are shown in in Figs. 4 (b) and 5 (b), the control inputs are shown in Figs. 4 (c) and 5 (c), and the tracking errors are shown in the states of the controlled system does not enter the sliding mode for q  X  7.0. Thus, the degenerate tracking response is resulted and the undesirable chattering phenomenon does not appear. Furthermore, the CSMC system with large uncertainty results of the CSMC system with large uncertainty bound for able chattering phenomenon occurs as shown in Figs. 6 (c) and racy arises in the CSMC scheme.

Then, the functional-linked RBF network control system ( Lin the control inputs are shown in Figs. 8 (c) and 9 (c), and the results show that the functional-linked RBF network control system can achieve favorable tracking performance even under the variations of system parameters. But, the paper does not duced by the functional-linked RBF network.

Finally, the proposed ANCSC system is applied to control a chaotic system again. The parameters of the ANCSC system are and Z B are the leaning rate of the robust compensator. If the On the other hand, if the leaning rates are chosen large, the learning speed will be fast; however, the system may become responses of state x are shown in Figs. 10 (a) and 11 (a), the results show that a satisfied tracking performance can be achieved after the controller parameters learning even under the variations of system parameters. However, since the para-meter vectors of FWNN are initialized from zero, the ANCSC a chaotic system again. The simulation results of the trained respectively. The tracking responses of state x are shown in in Figs. 12 (b) and 13 (b), the control inputs are shown in Figs. 12 (c) and 13 (c), and the tracking errors are shown in the tracking performance of the trained ANCSC system is better than other methods.

In summary, the performance measures of various control shows that the proposed ANCSC system possesses the most accurate tracking performance and the proposed ANCSC system is more suitable for the chaotic system. 5. Conclusions
