 Computing useful recommendations for cold-start users is a major challenge in the design of recommender systems, and additional data is often required to compensate the scarcity of user feedback. In this paper we address such problem in a target domain by exploiting user preferences from a related auxiliary domain. Following a rigorous methodol-ogy for cold-start, we evaluate a number of recommenda-tion methods on a dataset with positive-only feedback in the movie and music domains, both in single and cross-domain scenarios. Comparing the methods in terms of item rank-ing accuracy, diversity and catalog coverage, we show that cross-domain preference data is useful to provide more accu-rate suggestions when user feedback in the target domain is scarce or not available at all, and may lead to more diverse recommendations depending on the target domain. More-over, evaluating the impact of the user profile size and di-versity in the source domain, we show that, in general, the quality of target recommendations increases with the size of the profile, but may deteriorate with too diverse profiles. Cross-domain recommendation, cold-start, diversity
Providing relevant suggestions of items for new users is a well-known problem in recommender systems. In such cases there is little or no information about the users prefer-ences, and traditional recommendation models are not able to compute meaningful personalized predictions. To com-pensate this lack of information, two major approaches have been studied in previous work: (i) preference elicitation tech-niques [10] that directly ask the user to provide some ratings before delivering recommendations, and (ii) methods that exploit additional information about the users to better es-timate their preferences. In the latter case, some approaches combine content and collaborative information [12], and oth-ers exploit demographic data or even the user X  X  personality [4] to address the user cold-start problem.

More recently, cross-domain recommender systems [1] that leverage additional information from different but related source domains have been introduced as a potential solution to cold-start situations. This auxiliary information can be exploited to mitigate the lack of historical data in the target recommendation domain, thus addressing the user cold-start [3]. In one of the first papers on the topic, Winoto and Tang [15] conjectured that although the introduction of cross-domain information could deteriorate the prediction perfor-mance in the general  X  X on cold-start X  case, it could still lead to more diverse recommendations. Subsequent work proposed methods to effectively learn and transfer knowl-edge from the source domain to the target [5], and found that the quality of the recommendations improves when the involved domains are semantically more related [11]. Never-theless, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work has tested Winoto and Tang X  X  conjecture regarding the diversity of recommendations when cross-domain data is exploited.
Moreover, in [2] it has been shown that users perceive dif-ferences in the recommendation quality depending on the variety of items they naturally prefer. Based on this obser-vation, we hypothesize that both the amount and diversity of source domain preferences have an impact on the accuracy of cross-domain recommendations. Specifically, we identify three main research questions: We investigate these issues by evaluating a number of memory-based and matrix factorization algorithms in single and cross-domain scenarios, using two datasets with positive-only only feedback consisting of Facebook likes on movies and mu-sic artists, mapped to DBpedia 1 entities, whose metadata is used to also evaluate two state-of-the-art graph-based meth-ods able to exploit heterogeneous information in the recom-mendation process. Dataset. The recommendation models presented in this pa-per were evaluated on a Facebook dataset with user likes for movie and music items, which we extended with item meta-data extracted from DBpedia. In [13] we detail the dataset and the developed process to automatically extract DBpe-dia semantic networks relating items and features. Next we provide a brief summary of them. In the original raw data  X  X s acquired from the Facebook Graph API X  each user-like -item relation was given as a 4-tuple with the identi-fier, name and category of the liked item, and the times-tamp of the like creation, such as { id:  X 35481394342 X , name:  X  X he Matrix X , category:  X  X ovie X , created time:  X 2015-05-14T12:35:08+0000 X  } . Distinct names may exist for the same item, e.g.,  X  X he Matrix X ,  X  X he Matrix: Film series X  and  X  X he Matrix (saga) X  for  X  X he Matrix X  movie saga. Users thus may provide likes for different Facebook pages referring to the same item. Consolidating and unifying the items of the ex-tracted Facebook likes , our method automatically maps the items names to the unique URIs of the corresponding DBpe-dia entities, e.g., http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Matrix for the identified names of  X  X he Matrix X  movie saga. A core stage in the method is to execute SPARQL queries to the DBpedia endpoint that (i) map item names with entity la-bels, expressed through the rdfs:label property, (ii) disam-biguate entities using the rdf:type property and the Face-book item category field, and (iii) consider equivalent item names by means of the dbo:wikiPageRedirects property. Evaluated recommendation methods. We evaluated the following recommendation algorithms in single and cross-domain scenarios, using the validation set to tune model hyperparameters in each case.
 POP : Recommends the most popular items not yet liked by the user. UNN : User-based nearest neighbors with Jaccard similarity and neighborhood size of k = 100. INN : Item-based nearest neighbors with Jaccard similarity and indefi-nite neighborhood size. IMF : Hu et al. X  X  matrix factoriza-tion method for positive-only feedback [6] with 29 factors for movies and 21 factors for music.

Thanks to the linking of items to entities in the DBpe-dia knowledge graph, we are able to exploit algorithms that leverage the graph-based nature of the underlying side infor-mation. In particular, we built a hybrid graph as proposed in [9] and we used it as input for the following two algorithms. HeteRec : Graph-based recommender system proposed in [16], based on a diffusion method of user preferences follow-http://dbpedia.org ing different meta-paths. PathRank : Personalized PageR-ank considering the connectivity between users and items along different meta-paths [8].

For UNN, INN, IMF, HeteRec and PathRank we consid-ered both their application to single-domain scenarios and to cross-domain ones. Hereafter we use the prefix  X  X D- X  to indicate the cross-domain version of the corresponding algo-rithm.
 Evaluation methodology. For the evaluation we follow the user-based 5-fold cross-validation strategy proposed in [7] for cold-start scenarios. First, we select users in the tar-get domain with at least 16 likes and split them into five equally sized subsets. For each fold, we keep all the data from the other folds in the training set, whereas the likes from the users in the selected fold were randomly split into three subsets: training set (10 likes), validation set (5 likes), and testing (remaining likes, hence at least 1). In order to simulate different user profile sizes from 1 to 10 likes, we repeat the training and the evaluation ten times, starting with the first like in the training set and incrementally in-creasing it one by one. This setting allows us to evaluate each profile size with the same test set, avoiding potential biases in the evaluation due to different test set sizes [7]. Af-ter this preprocessing, the Facebook music dataset contains 49 , 369 users, 5 , 748 music bands or artists, and 2 , 084 , 462 likes; the movie dataset contains 26 , 943 users, 3 , 901 movies, and 876 , 501 likes. The user overlap for movies is 89.96% and music is 84.69%. In order to simulate the cross-domain scenario, we simply append the full source domain dataset to the previous training set. We used the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to evaluate the ranking accuracy of the recom-mendations, which computes the average reciprocal rank of the first relevant item in the recommendation list. Whereas, Intra-List Diversity (ILD) and Binomial Diversity Frame-work (BinomDiv) [14] were used to evaluate the individual diversity, namely the degree of diversity in the recommen-dation lists based on item genres extracted from DBpedia. Along with accuracy, we also measured catalog coverage as the percentage of items that are recommended at least once, to better understand the differences among the compared al-gorithms.
In the following we discuss the outcomes of three experi-ments we conducted to investigate each of the research ques-tions stated in Section 1.
 To address RQ1, we compare the accuracy of the target rec-ommendations in single-domain and cross-domain scenarios. Table 1 shows the MRR values for movies (left) and music (right) target recommendations.

Music (source) X  X ovies (target) . CD-UNN is the most accurate method for extreme cold-start users (0 likes in tar-get domain), CD-INN where 1 or 2 likes are provided, and CD-IMF from 3 to 10 likes. Curiously, CD-INN and CD-HeteRec using only cross-domain information are able to beat almost all the other methods even where they use tar-get information up to 4 likes. Moreover, CD-UNN is subject to a drastic fall from 0 to 1 like, obtaining the worst accuracy among all the methods and configuration (even lower than POP). Further analysis revealed that this is due to our choice of Jaccard as user similarity metric, which we observed pro-vides unreliable scores in cold-start situations. Comparing the methods between single and cross-domain configuration, we can see that only INN and IMF can benefit from music feedback in terms of accuracy. All the other methods lose accuracy when music feedback is also considered. In terms of coverage, UNN is the only method able to benefit from music feedback: UNN reaches values from 10% to 18% and CD-UNN from 38% to 50% among the different profile sizes.
Movies X  X usic . CD-HeteRec yields the most accurate recommendations in the extreme cold-start scenario, while CD-INN is the best method for all the other profile sizes, even though UNN obtains close values with 8 and 9 likes, and UNN and IMF overcome CD-INN with 10 likes but with a not relevant difference. CD-UNN shows again a drastic loss from 0 X 4 target likes, falling even below POP. In terms of catalog coverage, the trends are very similar to the ones in movies domain. Interestingly, CD-INN beats again all the other methods in terms of accuracy and catalog coverage with 1 and 2 likes in the target domain. Analyzing the use of cross domain information, INN is once again able to reach better accuracy using the additional movie likes, while Het-eRec obtains a benefit where less feedback is provided (from 1 to 5). Again, CD-HeteRec with 0 likes in the target domain overcomes all the other methods even where they use more target information (up to 8). However its catalog coverage is too low (1%) compared the other methods ( &gt; 10%).
Summing up, we may say that cross-domain information is arguably useful to face the cold-start user problem, allowing to generate relevant recommendation even where no target information is available. The choice of the method depends on the domain and amount of user information available. Moreover, we discover that some methods obtain exception-ally better results using only the source domain rather than using a few target feedbacks as well. More research will be needed for better understanding this trend.
 This section addresses RQ2, namely testing whether cross-domain information leads to more diverse recommendations. Tables 1 shows the diversity results for movies and music domain in terms of BinomDiv@10. We also compared the methods using the ILD metric, but we do not show its values, since they obtain a very similar trend to BinomDiv.
Music X  X ovies . POP obtains good results values, since all the most popular movies in the dataset belong to differ-ent genres, but CD-UNN and UNN overcome it with 1 and 2 likes, and only UNN from 3 to 6. In general, using cross-domain music information yields to less diverse recommen-dations. Movies X  X usic . PathRank and CD-PathRank produce the most diverse recommendations. Conversely, MF methods lead to the worst diversity. In contrast to the pre-vious situation, using cross-domain movies information for music recommendations improves nearly always the diver-sity degree of the recommendations.
 In order to address RQ3, we compute the number of prefer-ences and the intra-list diversity of the user profiles in the source domain, and group users in different ranges. For the profile sizes we split users in intervals of 20 likes, from size 0 to 100 and beyond, and for profile diversity we classify the users in terms of the distribution of ILD scores. Specif-ically, we define four groups based on the quartiles which we name Very low (0 X 25%), Low (25% X 50%), Medium (50% X  75%), and High (75% X 100%). Finally, we average the MRR of the recommendation lists in the target domain separately for each group, first in terms of profile size and then in terms of diversity. Figure 1 shows the relation between the quality of the target recommendations and the analysed source pro-file properties. We only report the results for the extreme cold-start profile sizes in the target, i.e., 0 and 10, as the rest showed similar behavior.

In terms of source profile size, we notice that in general the quality of target recommendations improves monotonically as more information about the user X  X  preferences is available in the source domain. This trend holds for all the evaluated algorithms with the exception of CD-IMF in music, where we see that the performance degrades when the size of the source profile is larger than 100. In this case, we argue that the abundance of auxiliary preferences could be drifting the learning of the model parameters towards the source domain, although a deeper analysis is needed to confirm our intuition.
Regarding the impact of the source profile diversity we find that the best results are achieved for users very focused on limited types of items, whereas a more diverse profile has a negative effect on the accuracy of the recommendations.
M ovies
M usic This seems to indicate that the evaluated algorithms strug-gle to find inter-domain correlations, specially from music to movies. In the case of very high diversity we see that the two settings diverge: variety in source movie preferences is beneficial for music recommendations, whereas the converse has the opposite effect.

We conclude that both the source user profile size and diversity have a significant impact on the quality of cross domain recommendations, thus confirming RQ3. On a side note, we observe the superior performance of CD-INN in most of the considered scenarios, specially in the extreme cold-start with target profile size of 0. We argue that this behavior is a consequence of the relatively large overlap of users between the analysed domains, an issue that we plan to further investigate in future work.
We have studied the quality of cross-domain recommen-dations in terms of accuracy, diversity and catalog coverage, evaluating a number of algorithms on two datasets with positive-only feedback. Our results show the benefits of cross-domain information in cold-start situations in terms of ranking accuracy. Regarding diversity we observe dif-ferent behavior in the two datasets, and therefore conclude that in general the results depend on the target domain. We have also studied the impact of the size and diversity of user profiles in the source domain, concluding that while more cross-domain user preferences are helpful, a greater item di-versity in the source profile can actually harm the perfor-mance in the target domain. Following this work we intend to further investigate which characteristics of the datasets could explain the differences we found in both recommen-dation and user profile diversity. We plan to extend our analysis to more domains, e.g. books, and to evaluate more sophisticated methods from the state of the art, such as [5].
