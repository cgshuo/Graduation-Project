 Online social networking platforms have become a popular channel of communications among people. However, most people can only keep in touch with a limited number of friends. This phenomenon results in a low-connectivity so-cial network in terms of communications, which is inefficient for information propagation and social engagement. In this paper, we introduce a new recommendation service, called link revival , that suggests users to re-connect with their old friends, such that the resulted connection will improve the social network connectivity. To achieve high connectivity improvement under the dynamic social network evolvement, we propose a graph prediction-based recommendation strat-egy, which selects proper candidates based on the predictio n of their future behaviors. We then develop an effective model that exploits non-homogeneous Poisson process and second-order self-similarity in prediction. Through comprehensi ve experimental studies on two real datasets (Phone Call Net-work and Facebook Wall-posts), we demonstrate that our proposed approach can significantly increase the social net -work connectivity, and that the approach outperforms other baseline solutions. The results also show that our solution is more suitable for online social networks like Facebook, par -tially due to the stronger long range dependency and lower communication costs in the interactions.

As social networking platforms become popular nowadays, improving the social connectivity and reachability for use rs has attracted many interests. Most existing work focuses on recommending new friends to users [11, 21, 7, 3]. Nonethe-less, it is unlikely that a person often responds to connec-tion requests from strangers. Moreover, such connections a re usually one-time interactions and hard to last for long. We argue that, maintaining existing friendships is as essenti al as expanding new friendships in the social network evolve-ment, and that reviving the links with old friends is another important way to enhance the social network connectivity.
Everyday, people interact with their friends through socia l media such as phone calls, emails, messages, blogs, chats, etc. However, due to the limitation in time and energy, many people are not able to stay in touch with friends all the time, resulting in broken or weakened social links (in terms of the frequency of interactions between people) from time to time. Meanwhile, a well-connected social network where users actively interact with each other is important for the social networking service providers, from both perspectiv es of user retention and business growth. For users, good con-nections with friends may enhance the friendship, bring up more new friends and broaden their social reach and activ-ities. For business, highly active interactions among user s provide natural and valuable channels for propagation of news, advertisements and trends, which can be transformed into great market potentials. Hence, it is desirable for the service providers to help users strengthen their social con -nectivity and to increase these services X  market value.
In this paper, we introduce a link revival recommendation service, to strengthen the social links between users, whil e keeping the extra communication overhead low. This service suggests one existing but  X  X ost in connection X  friend for a user to reconnect at a time. Via the reconnections, we can expect a significant boost in the social network connectivit y.
To recommend a good candidate friend for reconnection in order to strengthen the social connectivity is challeng-ing. One straightforward solution is to simply choose the  X  X east interacted X  X riends as the recommendation candidat es, such that there is a higher chance to generate new links. This strategy only greedily increases the connection in a local scope, but cannot maximize the connectivity under the global view, especially when many  X  X east interacted X  friends themselves are usually inactive and can thus bring less serendipity. Further, consider the global connectivi ty optimization, another approach could be recommending frie nds who are connected with the most people. However, if such a friend has been frequently interacting with the target user , recommending him/her is unnecessary as they are already well connected. As pointed out in [6], increasing the intera c-tions with friends who have been communicating frequently does not lead to a significant change in the user X  X  current social status. On the other hand, strengthening some weak social ties is expected to have more positive effects.
According to the above analysis, ideal candidates for link revival are generally those that exhibit the following thre e behaviors, 1) the candidates are unlikely to connect with the target user for a period of time in the future (other-wise, there is no need to recommend him/her as they will interact anyway), 2) the candidates are willing to respond i f somebody proactively contacts them, and 3) the candidates themselves have decent social connectivity such that con-nectivity improvements can be brought to the target user by connecting with them.

While the three conditions may seem simple, the dynam-ics of social network bring great challenges. As time goes by, unfamiliar people might become close friends, while pop -ular figures might lose their charms. Therefore, the whole remedy of the link revival problem relies on a thorough un-derstanding of the role of time. Our recommendation aims to incorporate the momentary changes in social networks; the problem thus boils down to build a prediction model for the future behaviors of people, and based on the prediction results, the proper candidates can be selected as the model has taken temporal trends into account.

In this paper, we propose a novel graph prediction-based recommendation strategy, which derives recommendations from a predicted view of the future social network. Fur-ther, we model the temporal interaction distribution be-tween users with non-homogeneous Poisson processes, where the rate parameter  X  t varies as the time t changes. A partic-ular Hurst exponent defining the second-order self-similar ity is introduced in our model to estimate the data autocorre-lations and provide good approximations of the predictions . Further, we also build a feature-based regression model by incorporating the Hurst exponent with a set of first-order statistic features, with which the final recommendation re-sults are generated.
In summary, our contributions are in five-fold: 1. We introduce a new research problem, namely link re-2. We propose a novel recommendation approach based 3. We present a new prediction model based on the non-4. We implement recommendation algorithms for multi-5. Our paper empirically uncovers some interesting pat-
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec-tion 2, we review prior studies related to our work. Section 3 presents the prediction-based link revival approach, and o ut-lines the generic recommendation framework. In Section 4, we detail the graph prediction model. Section 5 reports the evaluation results and Section 6 concludes this paper.
In this section, we review the existing work in two areas closely relevant to our study: recommender systems in socia l networks and social link models.
According to the recommended objects, the recommender systems in social networks can be categorized into two types : the item recommender systems [2], which suggest interesting items, such as movies, songs, books and other products, to a user, and the people recommender systems , which recom-mend homogeneous users in the same system to a given user, in order to help her discover expertise, potential friends, old acquaintances, etc. Our link revival recommendation servi ce belongs to the second category.

Recently many work used the social connections among people and their social activities to improve the item recom -mendation results [8, 14, 29, 18]. These work all focused on improving the item recommendation quality by considering the social relationships between the users in the system. Th e types of recommended objects are different from our work (for example movies vs. friends).

Recommending people in social networks is an important task for many recommender systems. Akin the  X  X eople you may know X  X unction on Facebook [1], many work proposed to recommend potential friends to users in a social network [11 , 21, 7, 3]. Despite the simple strategy of suggesting friends -of-friends [1, 3], content-based approaches were proposed to match the content of user profiles and determine user sim-ilarities for recommendation in [3, 21, 7]. In [3, 7], the authors further included multiple types of transaction in-formation, such as co-tagging, co-commenting records, tha t are related to a pair of users to facilitate the recommen-dation. [22] discussed friend recommendation in a different setting  X  social matching, and presented many critical re-search issues. Our study is fundamentally different from these work in recommendation objects, optimization goals and solutions. First, we look into existing friendships and aim to recommend old friends for reconnection, while the above work all tried to introduce new social ties into the social network. Second, our recommendation is optimized towards improving the social network connectivity, which i s a very important research issue to the best of our knowledge not yet studied by the related work. Finally, the temporal evolvements of the dynamic interactions between users are crucial in our recommendation, but most prior work merely treated the social network connections and transactions as static features.
Our proposed approach relies on the predicted social links among people, which is the part of the problem of social link modeling and prediction.

While many existing work treated social ties as binary variables { exist, not exist } , it is argued that such represen-tation misses a lot of detailed information needed for socia l network analysis. To precisely model and analyze the social ties among users, quite a few work has been proposed [5, 28, 13]. In [5], a user study has been conducted to evaluate the impact of a variety of factors, such as number of mutual friends and wall post messages, in the strength of social tie s. Then, the authors proposed a linear model to combine all the factors in predicting the tie strengths. In [13], the tot al number of social activity transactions, as well as the topo-logical features, were considered in a model for classificat ion of strong and weak social ties. Xiang et al. [28] assumed that a latent variable derived from the relationship and similar -ity of two users can determine the interactions between the users. Based on this assumption, an unsupervised learning method is applied to extract the latent variable and infer th e social tie strength. These studies, although involving onl y the static features of social networks, provide good insigh ts for understanding the social tie strength.

There are some analytical studies [25, 19, 15] on tempo-ral interactions in social networks. The results of [25, 19] revealed that the interaction behaviors between users are drifting significantly over time, which provide strong supp ort to our prediction-based recommendation approach. In [15], the authors took an information dissemination view on the interactions. They introduced the concept of information delay, which is directly related to the time and frequency of interactions, and identified a backbone structure on which the information delay is minimized.

Besides modeling the strength of social ties, many re-search efforts are dedicated in predicting the formation of new social ties [17, 16, 26, 23]. The link prediction problem was initially introduced in [17]. The study examined the effectiveness of several simple heuristics such as number of common friends, network proximity and PageRank in the prediction. In [16], Kunegis et al. applied spectral graph transformation techniques on binary social links to predic t the possible links in the future. Both [26] and [23] utilized temporal interaction data and the time-agnostic maximum entropy method in link prediction. The goal of these work in identifying possible social interactions in the future is r ele-vant to the graph prediction part of our work. Nevertheless, while link prediction yields a binary result (linked or not linked), the graph prediction in our study generates a quan-tified number of future interactions. In [12], the evolvemen t of academic collaboration network is studied, and a predic-tion model based on non-homogeneous Poisson process is used to predict the future collaborations of authors. This work only considers first-order statistics and the model is essentially a Markovian process. On the other hand, our work focuses on capturing the second-order self-similarit y and long range dependency in interaction behaviors. We note that the long-range history is important  X  if two users periodically (i.e., once per month) interact with each othe r, it might be redundant to recommend one to another even at the time point when they have been inactive for a dozen of days. Moreover, we take a further step to apply the graph prediction results in the novel link revival problem with th e ultimate goal of improving the social network connectivity .
In this section, we first formally define the link revival recommendation problem, then introduce the idea of graph prediction-based recommendation strategy. Based on this idea, we present a generic algorithm framework for the rec-ommendation service.
A social network is generally modeled as a graph G = h U, L i , where the nodes U = { u i } represent the individu-als in the network, and the links L = { ( u i , u j ) | u indicate the friendships between people. In our work, we not only consider the existence of static social relationsh ips, but more importantly the time-evolving dynamic interac-tions between friends. Therefore, we introduce the concept of link activeness to capture the communication activities among users from time to time. The activeness A [ t,t  X  ] of a link ( u i , u j ) during a time period [ t, t  X  ] is measured by the number of interactions (e.g., phone calls, wall-posts o r messages) between the users u i and u j . If no interactions ( u i , u j ) is inactive in this time period. Therefore, the so-cial graph is augmented with time and interaction data as G for any specified time period [ T, T +  X  t ], we can define the time-constrained connectivity C ( G [ T,T + X  t ] ) as a func-tion that quantify the users X  strengths in social interacti ons within [ T, T +  X  t ]. Inactive links in [ T, T +  X  t ] do not con-tribute to the time-constrained connectivity.

Link revival is a recommendation service that selects some old friends and suggests the target users to interact with them. Suppose that the recommendation service is invoked at a certain time T . Let G next = G [ T,T + X  t ] be the social interaction network with normal social evolvement process (i.e., no recommendations are involved) during the next tim e interval [ T, T +  X  t ]. As a result of the link revival recom-mendations, a new graph G new is formed by adding a set of extra interactions R = { ( u i , u j ) T } into G next newly added interactions may increase the activeness of cor -responding links, or even promote inactive links to active ones, the connectivity of G new is expected to be increased over G next . The goal of link revival is to maximize the im-provement of connectivity, as formally stated in Definition 1.
Definition 1. Link revival. Given the current time T and a time interval  X  t , the link revival problem is a rec-ommendation problem that targets on improving the social connectivity for a user u i , by suggesting a friend u j to in-teract with during [ T, T +  X  t ] . When u i adopts the recom-mendation and communicate with u j , the interactions will result in a new social interaction graph G new . The objective of link revival is to maximize the the connectivity improve-ment  X  C = C ( G new , u i )  X  C ( G next , u i ) , where G graph without recommendations.
Note that we do not assume a specific connectivity func-tion, due to the lack of a commonly agreed definition for connectivity. Nonetheless, our proposed recommendation technique is generic and applicable to a variety of connecti v-ity functions. As shown later in performance evaluation, we validate our ideas and demonstrate the applicability of our proposal with three popular connectivity functions, i.e., the number of friends-of-friends [10], clustering coefficient [ 24] and reachability [9], which will be discussed later.
While our link revival recommendation tries to maximize the improvement of social connectivity in G new over the orig-inal G next , the ideal solution is to analyze the connections in G next to find out the optimal solution. Unfortunately, the actual structure of G next is unknown at time T . One could utilize the historical data G past = G [ T  X   X  t,T ] to approximate the structure of G next , however, this approach only works well for a stationary network where people X  X  behaviors do not change. In fact, the non-stationary nature is an impor-tant characteristic of social interaction networks, and th us it is critical to capture the future trends of the social net-work to make good recommendations. In light of this idea, our prediction-based recommendation decomposes the rec-ommendation task into two phases, namely, 1) the graph pre-diction phase that predicts the possible structure of G next which yields a new graph G pred and 2) the recommendation phase that generates suggestions R = { ( u i , u r ) T } to users upon the predicted G pred .
 Here, we use an example to further illustrate our idea. Figure 1(a) shows an example social interaction graph G past For simplicity, we omit inactive links between nodes and use the width of the lines to indicate the link activeness. Based on the historical interactions in the network, we predict th e communications between people in the following time pe-riod [ T, T +  X  t ], as shown in Figure 1(b). The links in G pred are associated with weights indicating the predicted activeness between each user pair during [ T, T +  X  t ]. Ide-ally, although G pred may be different from the ground truth G next (the real activities of people during [ T, T +  X  t ]), it should be close to G next as much as possible. Thus, it in-corporates the future trends and changes in people X  X  behav-iors, and reveals the possible strength of social ties among people. On G pred , we can analyze the network and make re-vival recommendations to improve the connectivity in G pred The recommended friend links are depicted as dashed lines in Figure 1(c). Then, together with the real interactions G next (Figure 1(d), the recommendations results in a new graph G new (Figure 1(e)), upon which the actual connectiv-ity improvement will be evaluated. As we can see, some rec-ommended links such as ( u 1 , u 2 ), ( u 2 , u 5 ), ( u 3 and ( u 6 , u 7 ) are useful because the users are actually recon-nected via the link revival. Meanwhile, some recommenda-tions (e.g., ( u 2 , u 4 )) do not benefit the network connectivity because they overlap with active links, thus are considered unnecessary and should be avoided.

The graph prediction phase plays an essential part in our recommendation. In using the predicted graph G pred for recommendation, the key is to precisely capture the future trends in the graph. Hence, we formulate the historical in-teraction data among people as link trends to facilitate the prediction. By partitioning the time into equal-sized in-tervals with length  X  t , the activeness of each friend pair
Figure 1: Prediction and recommendation phases ( u i , u j ) in the time intervals can be represented as a time the link trend between u i and u j . The link trends record the past behavior changes in people X  X  interactions and serv e as a basis of our prediction. Moreover, the personalities of users and the topological of static friendship links may als o impact the future behaviors. In Section 4, we will introduce our model of predicting the future interaction graph, which exploits the temporal features of link trends and other soci al network features.

On the other hand, the recommendation phase is closely related to the specific definition of connectivity (while the prediction technique can be quite generic), and we will use three representative definitions to demonstrate the effecti ve-ness of our prediction-based recommendation idea. In the following, we introduce the algorithmic framework of our recommendation strategy.
A generic link revival recommendation algorithm devel-oped from the prediction-based strategy is outlined in Al-gorithm 1. The algorithm takes the social network G and the historical link trends I = { I ( u i , u j ) } as the input, and predict the interaction graph G pred in the next time inter-val by invoking PredictFuture (). In PredictFuture (), the link activeness, i.e., the number of interaction betwee n each pair of friends, will be predicted. In our study, we adopt the non-homogeneous Poisson process with second-order self-similarity model in this function. The model wil l be presented in the next section.

Then, in the recommendation phase, the algorithm, for each user u , enumerates each friend v of u and estimates the connectivity gain of adding a reconnection interaction ( u, v ) T to the predicted graph. The friend corresponding to the link that yields the highest connectivity will be recom-mended to the user.

The connectivity function computeConnectivity () can incorporate a variety of connectivity metrics. In this stud y, we consider three commonly used connectivity metrics. 1. Number of active friends-of-friends. Friends-of-2. Clustering coefficient. The clustering coefficient [24] Algorithm 1 RevivalRec( G = h U, L i , I , T ) 1: /* Phase 1: Prediction */ 2: G pred  X  PredictFuture ( G, I , T ) 3: /* Phase 2: Recommendation */ 4: for each user u  X  U do 5: maxConnectivity  X  0, bestRevival  X  NULL 6: F ( u )  X  all friends of u 7: for each v  X  F ( u ) do 8: G  X  = G pred  X  X  ( u, v ) T } 9: C ( G  X  , u )  X  computeConnectivity ( G  X  , u ) 10: if C ( G  X  , u ) &gt; maxConnectivity then 11: bestRevival  X  v 12: maxConnectivity  X  C ( G  X  , u ) 13: end if 14: end for 15: Recommend bestRevival to u 16: end for 3.

In this section, we introduce our model for predicting the social interaction graph in the future time interval. Below , we will first study the non-stationary characteristics in so cial interactions via data analysis on a real dataset, and then develop the prediction model with non-homogeneous Poisson process and second-order self-similarity statistics.
Given a social interaction network, it is natural to ask: how people interact in this network? Are there some general interaction patterns? How do different types of behaviors in -fluence the future interactions? To answer these questions, we will need to characterize the link trends and study their features. Recall that the link trends are historical data th at record the interaction behaviors of user pairs as time serie s. Here, we further analyze the link trends by examining a real communication dataset consist of interactions by phone cal ls in a cellphone network with 200k users. There are 14 million phone calls collected in a 22-week time period (the identiti es of people and contents of calls are removed before we acquire the data). Figure 2 depicts some typical link trends of the phone call network. Here, the x-axis is a time sequence of sixteen weeks (the rest 6 weeks are used for testing), while the y-axis is the number of interactions between a pair of users occurred in each week. As shown, there exists three typical interaction patterns, namely, 1) constant , 2) bursty and 3) rare . The link trends are categorized as  X  X are X , if the total interactions in the sixteen week period is very small. When there are near constant number of interactions be-tween two users every week, the pattern is categorized as  X  X onstant X . Finally,  X  X ursty X  link trend exhibits spike pa t-terns in the temporal distribution of interactions.
We roughly classify all the link trends into the aforemen-tioned three categories through two dimensions: the active number of weeks that two users have live interactions ( x -axis) and the total number of interactions of two users in all time ( y -axis), as shown in Figure 3. The shaded area indicates the number of user pairs with the corresponding x , y values. As seen, 50.7% of the user pairs have a total number of interactions less than 4 (over 16 weeks), and are thus classified into the  X  X are X  category. If the distributio n of interactions falls into the [  X   X , +  X  ] range ( = y/x and  X  is the standard deviation), the corresponding link trend is classified into the  X  X onstant X  category (take up 17.7% of total). The rest of user pairs (31.6% of total) exhibit spike interaction behaviors  X  in some weeks there are few interac-tions, while in other weeks the interactions become dense. Thus, they are considered to have the  X  X ursty X  link trends.
Since the user pairs fallen into the  X  X are X  category may have very weak social ties, they are unlikely to engage in the reconnect interactions. Therefore, it may be a waste effort t o recommend such friends to a user. Technically, the data col-lected from these rarely-interact pairs are very sparse, an d thus there is not enough data to support statistical analysi s to model the communication process. On the other hand, the user pairs with  X  X onstant X  link trends have close social relationships already. A link revival recommendation is th us Figure 4: The example cumulative distribution of interaction frequency. unnecessary. Hence, the user pairs with bursty communica-tion behaviors (around 1/3 of total pairs of users) are our main target: they are more likely to be event-driven (hinted by the spike-alike interaction patterns; thus more likely t o respond to our link revival recommendation, which can be treated as one kind of invitation event).
After categorizing the link trends into three types, we vi-sualize the cumulative distribution of interaction freque ncy for each type, as shown in Figure 4. Each curve corre-sponds to one pair of users randomly sampled from one of the three interaction pattern categories. Clearly, we can o b-serve that the slopes of the curves are time-varying, which indicates that the human communication processes are non-stationary. Particularly, the MSE error of applying the lin -ear regression on the curve of bursty link trend is more sig-nificant than the other two. Thus, first-order statistics (e. g. moving average, total number of past interactions, number of recent communications) cannot precisely capture the dy-namics of human communication process, especially for the burst-behaved users.

The above observations lead us to model the link trends with a non-homogeneous Poisson process, as described in the following. Given a pair of users, the number of interactions N ( t ) in a unit time interval  X  (e.g., 1 week) follows the non-homogeneous Poisson process NH  X  P oisson (  X  ( t )  X  ), if where  X  ( t ) represents the interaction rate between the two users and is a function of time.

The interaction rate  X  ( t ) is typically event-driven. For ex-ample, if some event interesting to two users happens,  X  ( t ) will increase; as this event is gone,  X  ( t ) gradually fades away. The set of  X  ( t ), given an interaction time series, can be esti-mated via the maximum likelihood approach. However, here we are more interested in predicting the future interaction s (e.g. in the next 1 week) based on the historical time se-ries. Suppose we have estimated the  X  ( t ) for the future time (which can be estimated using the Optimal Tree [12]) condi-tioned on the historical data, the left question is to simula te the future time series as the prediction result.

Let  X ( t ) be the expected total number of interactions in the time period [0 , t ],  X ( t ) = R t 0  X  ( x ) d ( x ), we have
Proposition 4.1. Suppose t 1 , t 2 , , are arrival times of a non-stationary Poisson process with rate function  X  ( t ) , then  X ( t 1 ) ,  X ( t 2 ) , , are arrival times of the stationary Pois-son process with rate parameter 1.

Proof. Suppose { N t , t  X  0 } is a non-stationary Poisson process with time-dependent rate function  X  ( t ). The process { M t  X  N  X   X  1 ( t ) , t  X  0 } , which is defined as follows a Poisson distribution with rate 1. At the same time, due to the independency of increments of { N t , t  X  0 } , { M t  X  N  X   X  1 ( t ) , t  X  0 } is also a process with independent increments. So, { M t } is also a stationary Poisson process with rate 1. Therefore,  X ( t 1 ), X ( t 2 ),..., are arrival times of the stationary Poisson process with rate parameter 1. With Proposition 4.1, we can simulate the future interactio n time series between two users as follows. First, we obtain a random variable x : x  X  Uniform (0 , 1). Next, we can sample an arrival time with fixed rate 1: y i = y i  X  1  X  log ( x ). Then, the next arrival time will be t i =  X   X  1 ( y i ). Once we know t i , we know the next time these two users will communication with each other (no interaction before t i ), and it becomes straightforward to predict the time series fo r any future time interval [ T, T +  X  t ].
Although Proposition 4.1 offers a principle approach to predict the future non-homogenous Poisson process, how to compute the inversion of  X ( t ) remains difficult, as usually the inversion of a continuous function like  X ( t ) will not be a closed-form solution.

Instead of bothering with this tough problem, we use another observation to estimate the non-homogenous Pois-son process. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 4, although the whole time series is a non-homogenous Poisson process, within each segment of time it is close to linear. That is to say, it is reasonable to treat each linear time series seg-ment as a stationary process such that we can use the self-similarity to calibrate the data trend.

Let H be Hurst exponent [27] of the time series N ( t ), which is defined by where a is the scale factor. The Hurst exponent H is between 0 and 1. When H is close to 1, it indicates that the stochastic process N ( t ) has a high self-similarity degree; when H is around 0.5, the process is randomly generated; and 0  X  H &lt; 0 . 5 means the anti-persistent behavior of the link trend. We then have
Proposition 4.2. If the interaction process N ( t ) is second-order self-similar, then the corresponding Hurst exponent H can be use to describe the autocorrelation trend in time seri es and thus used for the prediction on the future interactions. Proof. We define the second-order aggregation function N ( m ) ( k ) of the process N ( t ) as the average of N ( t ) between the (( k  X  1) m + 1)th and the ( km )th time segments: Then, the new stochastic process { X ( m ) ( k ) , k = 1 , 2 , , [ T ( T is the total time of N ( t )) is asymptotically self-similar only if [20] where  X  ( k ) is the autocorrelation function. Clearly, we have P k =1  X  ( k ) =  X  when H &gt; 0 . 5. So, the original process N ( t ) exhibits the long-range dependency, and we can use the definition of  X  ( k ) to measure the dependency between a series N ( t ) and a shifted version of itself N ( t + k ) (including k points of the future time series): So, the future time series can be estimated accordingly.
Note that the stationary assumption is critical when self-similar is studied. Hence, we partition the time series N ( t ) into disjoint segments and separately calculate the value o f Hurst exponent for each segment which should be piecewise stationary. After segmentation, the value of Hurst exponen t H can be estimated by various methods, including the tradi-tional Range/Scale (R/S) estimator [27] and wavelet-based approaches [4]. Since when the length of each segment is not too long, the R/S estimator becomes less accurate, thus in our implementation we use the wavelet-based estimation to obtain the Hurst exponents.
Let A H be the predicted number of interactions (i.e., link activeness) in [ T, T +  X  t ] between a pair of users u and v with the long range dependency. There exist certain errors due to the internal inaccuracy in estimating the Hurst ex-ponent [20] and Eq. 6 (as k is less than  X  in experiments). We incorporate a more robust linear regression model with A
H to compensate the errors with a set of other first-order and static features in the graph. Figure 5 lists all features that are considered in our regression.
 The regression model then can be written as In Equation 8, A  X  is an n  X  1 column vector represents the final prediction result of future interactions for n user pairs. A
H is an n  X  1 column vector of predicted interactions from the long range dependency, and a is a weighting scalar of A
H in the regression. The n  X  m matrix F is the feature matrix (except the A H feature), where m is the number of features. Each row in F corresponds to a user pair, and each column corresponds to a feature.  X  is the coefficient vector of m  X  1 that indicates the weights of the features.  X  is the regularization factor and is estimated via cross-validati on.
Finally, the predicted results A  X  will be plugged into the predicted graph G pred and perform the link revival recom-mendation.
In this section, we conduct experimental studies on the proposed recommendation services and evaluate our pro-posed recommendation strategy against baseline solutions and report the results.
Our analysis is conducted on two real social communica-tion datasets. One is the aforementioned cellphone network with 200k users and 14 million calls (denoted as CALL). The other is the wall-post records of Facebook, collected from the New Orleans Facebook network for a duration of over 2 years with 880k wall posts among 65k unique users (de-noted as FB) [25]. In Section 5.2, we will first look at some characteristics of these two networks. These results clear ly explain the need of the revival recommendation service and provide good supports to our prediction-based solution.
To compare the recommendation results of the proposed prediction-based approach, we implemented baseline algo-rithms including random recommendation (denoted as Rand , where a random friend is recommended out) and the method based on the static view (denoted as Static ). Particularly, in Static , we assume that the user behaviors are stationary; thus we use the past interaction graph G past = G [ T  X   X  t,T ] as G pred in Algorithm 1. For our graph prediction-based approach, we compared two versions. The first method (de-noted as F ) is a regression model with all the features men-tioned in Figure 5 but except A H . The second model is the regression model including all features (denoted as H+F ).
In the experiments, we generate one recommendation to each user, and assume that all the recommendations are adopted, i.e., users will follow the suggestions to re-conn ect with the recommended friend. This situation may not be true in real applications, however, since there is no open platform for researchers to deploy and test different strate -gies, we believe the total adoption assumption is reasonabl e as it is fair to various methods being compared. We will conduct user studies on the recommendation adoption ratio in our future work.
 For each recommendation strategy  X  Rand , Static , F and H+F , we construct a result graph G new by merging the rec-ommended interactions with the actual interactions within [ T, T +  X  t ] in the normally evolved graph G next (evolved from G past without link revival). Then, we compute the connectivity measures on G new and compare the value with that in G next (we label the results in G next as Org ). The method that generates the interaction graph with a higher connectivity has better performance.
Here, we present some empirical analysis results on the two social interaction networks CALL and FB.
 Sparsity of interactions. While people can have many friends in a social network, the interactions between them are usually very sparse. In our experiments, we measure the number of interactions occurring on each friend link during each time interval, and show the distribution in Figure 6. For the CALL dataset, people have 6 friends on average. However, in each time interval (one week), about 85% user pairs do not have any interactions, and the number of user pairs that communicate frequently is very small. The FB dataset exhibits even higher sparsity of interactions: the av-erage number of friends for the FB users is 5, where as 90% of the links are inactive within the time interval of one month. Given such low rate of interaction activities, the connecti v-ity of the social networks, in terms of timely interactions, will be also very low. Therefore, it clearly shows the neces-sity of developing a link revival recommendation service to enhance the social network connectivity.
In Figure 7, we present the distribution of interaction pat-terns with their contributions in total interaction activi ties. The links with constant link trends consist of only 17.7% of the total links in the CALL dataset, but more than 78% of all the interactions happen on these links. Meanwhile, although about half of the link trends fall in the  X  X are X  cate -gory, their corresponding links only generate 4% of the tota l interactions. For FB, due to extremely small ratio of the  X  X onstant X  link trends (2.7%), their contribution on the to -tal interactions is not as high as that in the CALL dataset, but is also significant (29.0%). Again, the  X  X are X  category, covering 67.8% of the links in FB, only generates 21.1% in-teractions. In both datasets, we can also observe that there is a large portion of links whose link trends belong to the  X  X ursty X  category. While these links have much lower in-teraction rate than the constant-interact links, they can b e strengthened (more easily) and bring critical network con-nectivity improvement.
 Hurst exponent value distributions. Our proposed model, based on the bursty-interact patterns and the assumption of event-driven communications, derives the Hurst exponent from second-order statistics and then exploits the second-order self-similarity (quantified by the Hurst exponent) in predicting future interactions. To demonstrate the fitness of this model, it is critical that the link trends exhibit the lo ng-range or short-range dependency. Figure 8 shows the esti-mated Hurst exponent value distribution of the link trends in the CALL and FB datasets. As shown, for both the bursty and constant categories, most link trends have a Hurst expo-nent greater than 0.5. Thus, we believe it is suitable to use the second-order self-similarity to describe these time se ries.
Meanwhile, we can observe that the Hurst exponent values of the link trends in the FB dataset is higher than that in the CALL dataset, which indicates that the interactions in FB exhibit stronger long-range dependency. This is because on Facebook, the event-driven interactions are stored in text , a format that is easy for people to retrieve from historical archives, while in CALL the interactions are through phone calls, whose contents are not usually recorded. Thus, the impact of events in FB can last longer than CALL. More-over, as the communication on Facebook is free, people tend to retain their interests on same events longer via interac-tions/discussions. For the phone call network, this trend i s weaker due to the relatively high cost in communications.
Cumulative distribution Figure 8: Cumulative distribution of Hurst expo-nent values
For the rare link trends, due to the extremely sparse inter-actions, the Hurst exponent cannot be accurately estimated . Thus, we omit the results for the rarely category here 1 .
In this subsection, we present the results of different rec-ommendation methods for the link revival problem. As dis-cussed, three metrics, namely, clustering coefficient, numb er of FoFs and reachability are used in the evaluation. Figure 9 reports the connectivity measures.

Figure 9(a) and 9(b) show the improvement of local clus-tering coefficients with the recommendation. Without rec-ommendation, the average clustering coefficients of users ar e 0.125 and 0.023 for CALL and FB, respectively. When we randomly select one of the friends of a user, the result graph s have slightly better clustering coefficients, but the improv e-ment is very limited. While adding more edges always in-
As the prediction will yield a zero for most rare link trends, which is consistent with the ground truth, the inaccuracy in estimating Hurst exponent does not influence the final results. (a) Local clustering coeffi-cient (CALL) (c) 2-hop friends (CALL) (e) Reachability (CALL) creases the network connectivity, we can see that the random approach is not effective in identifying good candidates due to its ignorance to the interaction features. Further, the Static approach, although better than Rand , performs worse than the prediction-based approaches. In general, there ar e considerable correlations between the past interaction be -haviors and the future behaviors, so that Static can utilize them in recommendation. However, the stationary assump-tion in Static prevent it from capturing the changes in peo-ple X  X  behaviors. Finally, H+F outperforms F by about 25% (CALL) and 30% (FB), respectively, and achieves a total in-crement of 100% (CALL) and 1400% (FB) over the original graph. Hence, we can see that the prediction result derived from the second-order self-similarity model significantly im-proves the recommendation results.

The friends-of-friends metric is evaluated in Figure 9(c) and 9(d). Compare with only an average of 1  X  2 2-hop friends for each user in the original graph G next , with the link revival recommendation users can have 5  X  6 2-hop friends. Figure 9(e) and 9(f) present the results for the reachability metric. Again, we observe the same trend that H+F performs the best and the prediction-based strategies are generally better than other baseline approaches. How-ever, we can see that the improvement of reachability is already quite significant for Rand , and H+F is 40%, 20% and 8% better than Rand , Static and F , respectively. This is because the computation of reachability involves the net -work traversal, and even adding a few links may have a good chance to bring unconnected parts of the network together and increase the reachability by a lot.

Consistent with our observation in Figure 8, the results show that the advantages of H+F over F is greater in the FB dataset than the CALL dataset. As discussed, this is because the interaction behaviors in Facebook have stronge r long-range dependency, due to the lower communication cost and longer memory of interaction data than the phone call network. Thus, we believe that our model is especially suit-able for the online social networks with similar features as Facebook, since the interaction behaviors on such platform s are often long-range dependent.
Finally, by comparing the result graph G new with G next , the graph under normal social evolvement, we study the impact of the link revival recommendations on other network characteristics.

First, we visualize G next and G new in Figure 10. For the cases of normal evolvement and recommendation, we extract a same subset of nodes from the datasets and display the links among them. In the figure, we can observe that the networks with recommendations are significantly more dense than the original graphs.

In Figure 11, we summarize some network statistics of the original graph with the normal evolvement, and the graph af-ter link revival recommendation. The results show that link revival has effectively leveraged the social network evolve -ments by strengthening inactive links between old friends.
In this study, we investigate a novel problem in social in-teraction networks named link revival, i.e., recommending old friends for re-connecting to improve the overall networ k connectivity. This recommendation service is critical for en-hancing the information dissemination efficiency and social impact of users in social networks. Through analyses of real social interaction networks, we observe that people X  X  inte r-action behaviors are non-stationary. To make good recom-mendations, it is important to capture the future status of the interaction network. Therefore, we propose a predictio n-based recommendation strategy, which performs recommen-dation upon a predicted social interaction network. More-over, based on the assumption of event-driven interactions , we propose to use a non-homogeneous Poisson process to model the interaction time series. Then, we exploit the second-order self-similarity (quantified by the Hurst expo -nent) to capture the structural similarity within the time series and approximate the non-homogeneous Poisson pro-cesses. By incorporating a set of other features with the approximation results in a linear regression model, we ob-tain the predictions of future interactions. Through empir -ical studies and performance evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves good connectivity improvement and outperforms other baseline solutions.
