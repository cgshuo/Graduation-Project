 identification. Due to this, Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used to estimate parameters for nonlinear systems ( Wang and Gu, 2007 ; Tavakolpour et al., 2010 )andSG( Ma and Wu, 1995 ; Niewierowicz et al., 2003 ). Although GA is efficient in finding the global minimum of the search space and the solutions are independent on initial values of the parameters, it consumes too much search time which is not proper for online identification reported in the literature ( Sabat and Coelho, 2009 ; Sabatetal.,2010 ). Comparing to GA, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is easy to implement and convergences quickly and it was improved a nd widely used in parameters identification such as parameters estimation of permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) ( Liu et al., 2008 ), induction motors ( Ursema and Vadstrup, 2004 ) and chaotic dynamic system ( Modares et al., 2010a ; Sun et al., 2010 ). However, it shows some shortages such as premature convergence ( Cai et al., 2007 ). Much effort has been put in improving the performance of PSO. With introducing quantum theory into PSO, a novel variant of PSO named quantum-behaved PSO (QPSO) algorithm was proposed in Sun et al. (2004 ). In QPSO algorithm, it assumes that the position and velocity of an individual cannot be determined simultaneously and a wave function is cited to describe the status of individuals. By employing the Monte Carlo method, the iterative equation of particles position is derived from the quantum probability density function. Comparing to PSO been used for system identification ( Sabat et al., 2010 ; Luitel and Venayagamoorthy, 2010 ), multi-objective optimization ( Omkar et al., 2009 ), controller design ( Shayeghi et al., 2010 ) and other fields.
In this paper, to increase con vergence speed and improve the identification accuracy of LDW-PSO, quantum operation is embedded in the evolution procedure and an improved algorithm tests are time-consuming and can be carried out when SG is not in service ( Abbas and Bayoumi, 2004 ; Escarela-Perez et al., 2004 ). In this study, an improved optimization algorithm named PSO X  X O is provided to solve this problem.

The basic idea of parameters estimation using heuristic opti-mization algorithms is to convert the problem of parameters identification into an optimization problem. Those unknown parameters are usually set as some particles or genes in chromo-somes and a performance function measuring how well the model response fits the system response is built to optimize. In this study, considering that different parameters compositions may result in the same system outputs and assuming that the field voltage, rotor angle, the electrical power and stator current can be measured, an improved fitness function is defined as (2) fitness  X  1 N where d i is the i th sample of the rotor angle of the original system, ^ d is the i th sample of the rotor angle of the estimated system, P ei is the i th sample of the electrical power of the original system, ^ P ei is the i th sample of the electrical power of the estimated system,
I is the i th sample of the stator current of the original system, ^ I i is the i th sample of the stator current of the estimated system.
As shown in Fig. 2 , the original and the estimated systems are supplied with a same excitation input and their outputs are given as inputs to the fitness evaluator, where the fitness is calculated.
The sum of squared error (SSE) for a number of samples shown as (2) is considered as fitness of estimated model. Then, as minimizing the fitness function, outputs of the estimated system approximates to the output of the original system and parameters of the estimated system converge to those of the original system. 4. Particle swarm optimization integrated with quantum operation 4.1. Overview of PSO and QPSO
By simulating social behavior such as bird flocking, fish schooling and swarm theory, PSO is firstly proposed by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995. In PSO, each particle described by velocity and position represents a potential solution to the problem. The particles repeatedly update their velocity and position until the pre-specified number of generations G or the precision of solution is reached. The update law can be expressed as v x ion, v k E
Combining (13) X (16), the position update rule can be expressed as follows: x 4.2. The hybrid algorithm
Considering that PSO converges quickly in the previous several iterations but easily falls into local minimum and QPSO is a global convergence guaranteed algorithm, which outperforms PSO in search ability, we propose a hybrid algorithm with integrating quantum operation into LDW-PSO in this paper. According to the characteristics of wavefunction of quantum Delta potential well model, some particles which can find much better positions in searching space are introduced into PSO. The diversity of the population is improved and the convergence speed and search ability can be enhanced.

Moreover, the hybrid PSO X  X O algorithm is also improved to detect and track the system parameter variation. Assuming qpso_pop , qpso_pbest and qpso_gbest represents the particles position, the individual best in history and the global best of the population in QPSO. Symbols qbest_fitness and best_fitness repre-sent the best fitness in QPSO and PSO. In PSO, the particles position, the individual best in history and the global best are denoted as pso_pop , pso_pbest and pso_gbest. The best individual gbest of the hybrid algorithm is selected from qpso_gbest and pso_gbest according to their fitness value. To detect any change of the system parameters, the global best particle of the hybrid algorithm is set as a sentry particle. It does not change its position and velocity until any change of the system parameters is found. While the fitness of global best becomes larger than a threshold or the iteration number reaches a threshold, the fitness value and velocity of the sensitive particle are updated by (18) X (22) to escape the global best position to find a new global best in the searching space. Otherwise, as Fig. 3 shows, other steps of the hybrid algorithm are carried out subsequently. qbest _ fitness  X  qbest _ fitness n LargeConstant ;  X  19  X  best _ fitness  X  best _ fitness n LargeConstant ;  X  21  X  pso _ velocity  X  pso _ velocity  X  rand n V max  X  22  X  5. Simulation results
This section presents the simulation settings and results of parameter identification of SG. The detail procedure and results are shown as follows. 5.1. Simulation settings
As shown in Fig. 1 , the study system is simulated in MATLAB and six key parameters are chosen to be estimated, which are J , D , x electric power, the reactive power and the machine voltage are set to P  X  0.8, Q  X  0, V  X  0.98 and a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) signal is applied to the field voltage. The sampling interval is set as 10 ms and the sampling procedure is lasted for 5 s. Then, signals of field voltage, rotor angle, electrical
In simulation, to perform fair comparison in fitness evaluation, population size of PSO, QPSO and PSO X  X O is 40, 40 and 20. The maximum generation and searching range are set as same in the three algorithms. Parameters of c 1 and c 2 in LDW-PSO and PSO X  X O algorithms are set as 2, and max iteration is 150. Parameter w in PSO and PSO X  X O increases from 0.2 to 1.2 and parameter of b in QPSO increases from 0.5 to 1.0.

To overcome the randomness of the heuristic optimization algorithms, 30 trials are tried and indexes of mean value, absolute error, parameter standard deviation (Std) and accuracy are used. The absolute error is defined as absolute error  X  9 original value mean value 9 :
It describes the distance of the mean value to the original value. To evaluate the precision of the mean value, accuracy index is defined as follows: Accuracy  X  1 absolute error parameter range 100 5.2. Offline identification Offline parameters estimation results using PSO, QPSO and PSO X  X O are listed in Table 1 , which is an average of 30 trials. To compare parameters identification accuracy of different methods, index of mean value, absolute error and parameter accuracy are used and listed in Table 1 . It is obvious that accuracy values of QPSO and PSO X  X O are higher than those of PSO in Table 1 , which indicts that parameters obtained by QPSO and PSO X  X O are more accurate than PSO. Meanwhile, it also can be observed that accuracy of PSO X  X O is much higher than that of QPSO. It implies that PSO X  X O performs better in accuracy than other two algo-rithms. Further, absolute errors of each parameter based on PSO X  X O, QPSO and PSO are calculated to measure the distance of mean values of the identified parameters to the original values. It can be seen that the maximal absolute error of PSO X  X O is only 3.116 10  X 4 , which is much smaller than the minimal absolute error of PSO and QPSO. It clearly shows that parameters identified by PSO X  X O are much more near to the original parameters and parameters mean values of PSO X  X O are more accurate. In addi-tion, std function in MATLAB2006 is used and Parameter Std values of the three methods are calculated to evaluate fluctuation of the best solution in 30 trials. Table 1 shows that the maximal value of Parameter Std ( x d 0 ) by PSO X  X O is 0.0023. Although it seems a little large, but it is smaller than Parameter Std value of x three algorithms are evaluated through mean fitness value (MFV) and standard deviation of fitness value (SDFV). It is obvious that the MFV of PSO is larger than that of QPSO and QPSO. Meanwhile, the SDFV of PSO is smaller than that of other two methods. It means that PSO is more stable than other two methods but easily trap into local optimum. Comparing to PSO, the MFV of QPSO is smaller and the SDFV of QPSO is larger, which implies that the
QPSO has strong search ability and can find the best solution. But the fitness fluctuation in 30 trials is also obvious. It infers that
QPSO is not very stable in searching the global best solution. With combining advantages of QPSO and PSO, the PSO X  X O method performs better in searching the global best solution. Table 2 shows that the MFV index of PSO X  X O is smaller than that of other two methods. It suggests that the improved algorithm can easily get the global best solution during the evolution procedure.
Although SDFV index of PSO X  X O is larger than that of PSO, MFV index of PSO X  X O is much smaller than that of PSO, which means that PSO easily drop into the local optimum and PSO X  X O easily find the best solution with more stable search ability.
Effectiveness of mean values of the identified parameters is also verified. System outputs including rotor angle, active power and stator current of the original and the estimated system are plotted in Figs. 6 X 8 . It is clear that the rotor angle, active power and stator current of the PSO algorithm have an obvious distance from the original dynamic process. Comparing to the PSO algorithm, the dynamic process of rotor angle, active power and stator current of
PSO X  X O and QPSO are much more close to those of original system. It indicts that the mean values of the two algorithms are more accurate and effective than those of PSO. Moreover, local enlarge figures are attached to show the discrepancy of the three algorithms. It is obvious in the local enlarge figures that rotor angle, active power and stator current of the PSO go across outputs of the original system. It infers that mean values of PSO are not accurate. Meanwhile, it can be observed that the curve trend of QPSO and PSO X  X O are same as that of the original system.
Although the curves of QPSO perform better than those of PSO, but distance of the curves of QPSO and the original system is also obvious. Comparing to PSO and QPSO, it is clear that system outputs of PSO X  X O are much more close to those of the original system. It implies that the average identified parameters by PSO X  QO are more effective and accurate than other two methods. To show the distance of the curves of PSO X  X O, QPSO and
PSO to those of the original system, absolute errors for rotor angle, active power and stator current of the three methods are evaluated and plotted in Figs. 9 X 11 . It is noted that logarithmic coordinates is used in y -axis. Figs. 9 X 11 obviously show that d error, P e error and I error obtained by PSO X  X O is much smaller than those of QPSO and PSO. It implies that the system outputs including rotor angle, active power and stator current based on PSO X  X O is much more close to those of the original system. It also verifies that PSO X  X O algorithm has a higher precision and is more effective in identifying parameters of SG than other two algorithms.

Fitness values for 30 trials are plotted in Fig. 12 to show the search ability and stability of the three algorithms. It can be seen that the fitness values of PSO in 30 trials are all larger than those of QPSO and PSO X  X O. Meanwhile, it can be observed that fitness of PSO is much more stable than those of other two algorithms. Thus, it can be inferred that PSO easily falls into the same local optimum. Furthermore, fitness values of QPSO and PSO X  X O are all much smaller with comparing to those of PSO. It can be observed that almost all the fitness values of PSO X  X O are smaller than those of QPSO. However, compared with QPSO, PSO X  X O seems very unstable with larger amplitude of variance. In fact, the fitness variance of PSO X  X O is smaller than that of QPSO, which needed by QPSO to convergence to the original parameter ers clearly indict the advantage of PSO X  X O in parameters 5.3. Comparison with extended Kalman filter (EKF) method
In this section, comparison test was also carried out to compare the proposed method with classic method such as the EKF method. Synchronous generator original parameters are set same as those in Lai and Ma (1996) and Ma and Wu (1995 ) and parameters searching range is 20% original parameter to 120% original parameter. Other parameters of PSO X  X O algorithm are same as those in Section 5.1. To evaluate the precision of the identification results, accuracy index defined in Section 5.1 and MaxError defined as follows are used: MaxError  X  max absolute error parameter range 100
Moreover, measurement noises with different variance ( Lai and Ma, 1996 ; Ma and Wu, 1995 ) listed in Table 3 is considered in this simulation. With the simulation test in each case carried out for 30 trials, mean value and the accuracy index of the estimated parameters are listed in Table 4 . Table 5 shows comparison results of PSO X  X O and EKF in no noise case and different noisy cases. It is noted that identification results based on EKF are cited directly from Lai and Ma (1996) and Ma and Wu (1995 ).
Table 5 shows that MaxError indexes of PSO X  X O and EKF in no noise case are both small. It infers that the two methods can identify parameters of SG with a high accuracy and small error in no noise case. Meanwhile, it can also be observed in Table 4 that accuracy index of PSO X  X O in no noise case is high and MaxError index of PSO X  X O in Table 5 is much smaller than that of EKF, which suggests that PSO X  X O performs better than EKF in esti-mating parameters of synchronous generator in no-noise case. Then, noise with small variance shown in case 2 of Table 3 is considered in simulation. It is obvious that accuracy of PSO X  X O in Table 4 still be satisfied. Comparisons of PSO X  X O and EKF through MaxError index obviously show that PSO X  X O performs better than EKF in small noise condition. Further, with the amplitude of noise variance increased by 10 times, parameters accuracy of PSO X  X O decrease and the MaxError index become larger. It infers that PSO X  X O may be affected by a larger noise. However, whereas parameters x d 0 and x q are changed at the same moment.
Parameter x d 0 is changed from 0.563 to 0.57 and x q is changed from 1.576 to 1.4. Figs. 20 X 22 show that PSO X  X O algorithm can detect parameters variation successfully. Moreover, these figures
