 H.3 [ Information Systems ]: Information Storage and Re-trieval Algorithms, Experimentation, Measurement Entity linking, entity disambiguation
With the emerging focus of search engines on semantic search, there is a growing need to understand queries and documents not only syntactically, but semantically as well. Over the recent years, major search engines have redesigned their output to accommodate some semantic information about the entities recognized in queries and search results. Recent information retrieval studies published in SIGIR have also paid a significant amount of attention to entity-related research. However, techniques for accurate entity recogni-tion and disambiguation are still far from perfect. The mo-tivation of this workshop is to advance the state of the art in entity recognition and disambiguation for both long and short web documents.

The objective of an Entity Recognition and Disambigua-tion (ERD) system is to recognize mentions of entities in a given text, disambiguate them, and map them to the known entities in a given collection or knowledge base. Building a good ERD system is challenging because
The challenge has two parallel tracks. In the  X  X ong text X  track, the challenge focuses on pages crawled from the Web; these contain documents that are meant to be easily under-standable by humans. The  X  X hort text X  track, on the other hand, consists of web search queries that are intended for a machine. As a result, the text is typically short and often lacks proper punctuation and capitalization. We hope the outcome of this challenge will provide researchers interested in the field with an opportunity to compare different ap-proaches, exchange thoughts, and formulate a shared vision to advance entity research in the future.

The challenge is open to the general public and partici-pants are asked to build their systems as publicly accessi-ble web services using whatever resources at their disposal. The entries to the challenge are submitted in the form of URLs to the participants X  web services. Participants have a period of 3 months to test their systems using develop-ment datasets hosted by the challenge website. The final evaluations and the determination of winners are performed on held-out datasets that have similar properties to the de-velopment sets. Further details can be found at the ERD challenge website at http://web-ngram.research.microsoft.com/erd2014 , and http://web-ngram.research.microsoft.com/erd2014/ Docs/Detail%20Rules.pdf . Archived discussions of a dedi-cated mailing list can be found at https://groups.google.com/d/forum/erd-2014 .

The ERD challenge is organized as a SIGIR workshop, and every team that submits results to one of the tracks is invited to the workshop to presents its approach. The workshop is co-sponsored by Google and Microsoft.
