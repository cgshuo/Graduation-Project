 Experienced analysts are remarkable at visually recognizing unusual patterns, however, current tools have not efficiently catered to these abilities. Progress in information visualization algorithms, display techniques, and user controls has made a new generation of software tools possible. This paper will present a new hybrid data mining tool, Origamim, designed and developed by Mr. Thomas Kraay. OrigamiTM can be used to identify complex, latent relationships present in large quantities of data. These relationships can be used to interactively explore useful and strategic information that would otherwise be intractable. data cartography, data mining, data visualization, autonomous analysis. 
Imagine that you have never been to the United States and that you have never even seen a map of the US. Suppose you ask someone to describe its shape and its geography. Perhaps the simplest and most usell response to your inquiry would be a map of the US. In addition to the map, it might be helpful to know the distances common to have this data available in the form of a distance matrix which is displayed along with the map. The distance matrix consists of a number of cities which are listed across the top and cities that correspond to the particular row and column of the matrix. The resulting matrix is symmetric (since the distance f?om A) and the diagonal elements are all zero. The distance between two cities can be viewed as a relationship between the two cities. Now, imagine trying to picture the United States if all you had was the distance matrix without the map. Obviously it is much more difficult to obtain an accurate  X  X icture X  of the shape and the geography of the US using only the distance matrix without the accompanying map. Unfortunately, in many real-world applications, the information available corresponds much more closely to the  X  X istance matrix X  without the more informative map. Also, the amount of data may accompanies a map. Thus, developing useful information, important insights, and answers to specific questions tim raw data can be a far more difficult problem. Attempts to solve these types of problems have traditionally involve using  X  X ata Mining X  techniques such as the use of queries or link analysis methods. For large data sets these methods are often impractical and readily overwhelmed. What is really needed may be described as a  X  X ata Cartography X  scheme capable of producing an accurate and informative  X  X ap X  of the data. This map would be enable the user to identify latent relationships among the data elements from which use&amp;l information and practical insights may be extracted. In many practical problems the number N of data elements (i.e.  X  X ities X  in the above example) is extremely large (on the order of thousands or tens of thousands). Relationships between the data elements are expressed numerically by the  X  X istance matrix X . Like the distance matrix involving cities, we shall assume that the matrix is symmetric and the diagonal elements are all 0. Thus, there are Nx(N-1)/2 meaningfi.d  X  X istances X . We make no assumption that the distances are  X  X onsistent X  (which they would be if derived from a map). The problem is to map each data element into a point in the xy-plane such that the Euclidean distances between the points in the plane preserves the distances in the matrix. Because there are plane has an x coordinate and a y coordinate (hence there are 2N possibilities for the coordinates). As noted above, there are Nx(N-1)/2 distances in the table that must be preserved. Since Nx(N-1)/2 is orders of magnitude larger than 2N (for large N), the result is a highly over-determined system (i.e. a system with far more conditions to be satisfied than there are. degrees of tieedom which could be used to satisfy those conditions). In general, such over-determined systems do not have an exact preserves all of the distances in the matrix. The standard approach to solve this type of problem is to construct the  X  X est X  solution possible using a least squares approximation. That is, Minimize: Solving this problem using conventional methods requires O(N3) operations and O@?) storage. (Note: O(N3) means that there are order N3 operations required to solve the problem. Hence, if N is doubled, it takes about 23 = 8 times as many operations to solve the problem.) For small values of N, this is acceptable, but even supercomputers balk when N approaches values of 10,000 or mom. The key mathematical feature of the Data Cartography scheme is the development of an approximation to the least squares solution which requires only O(N) operations. This means that even very large problems can be solved on PCs. This paper demonstrates the utility and the effectiveness of Data Cartography as a means of using the data to construct a map that enables the user to visualize useful information based on relationships among the data elements. It also demonstrates that large problems can be solved on very modest (inexpensive) computers. Consider a data set consisting of l,SOO,OOO telephone calls involving slightly more than 10,000 telephone numbers. A second data set includes subscriber information (names and addresses of the owners of the telephone numbers). A third data set consists of about 1,000 telephone numbers of individuals suspected of engaging in criminal behavior. These telephone numbers involve wire taps or PEN registers (records of calls to and from the telephone number of a potential suspect). Note that data sets two and three may contain telephone numbers not involved in the l,SOO,OOO telephone call data base. The source of the data for this problem was a law enforcement agency. This agency had been using traditional link analysis and data mining techniques for several years without obtaining useful information due to the large quantity of data available. The agency was interested in finding a new method of analyzing and extracting useful information from this complex set of raw data. Early efforts using previous state-of-the-art methods required intensive human involvement in adjusting computer suggested arrangements, dependence upon having to issue the  X  X ight queries X  in the  X  X ight sequence X , non-responsive computer rumimes, and demanding storage and memory requirements. These were just a few of the challenges confronting the agency. Because of the novel demands of this agency, the concept of constructing a  X  X ap X  from the given data became an intriguing possibility. In this case, instead of  X  X ities X , we use  X  X elephone numbers X . The  X  X istance X  between two telephone numbers is computed using a function whose value is inversely proportional to their frequency of communication. If two numbers never communicate, the distance is not defined, and the position in the plane corresponding to that number is determined by the other data elements (telephone numbers). This idea seemed sensible, but mapping 10,000 points into the plane seemed like a daunting problem which could only be solved using a supercomputer. However, this problem inspired the invention of a software package called  X  X rigami X , a pending patent held jointly by Mr. Chuck Brisbin, former Deputy Director of the Office of Law Enforcement, U.S. Department of Treasury, Dr. Ralph Carlson, a mathematician, co-author, and founder of MMEI Corporation, and Tom Kraay of MMEI and consultant to Nautilus Systems, Inc. The centerpiece of the invention is over 25 pages of mathematics deriving an amazingly accurate approximation to the solution of the least squares approximation, but which involves only O(N) operations and O(N) storage. Ita implementation on a 33MHz, 8MB RAM 486 computer required about an hour to convert the supplied raw data to  X  X aps X . Custom interface software was written for virtually instant exploitation of the results. Telephone numbers of interest (i.e. telephone numbers involved in wire taps and PEN registers) were depicted as solid small circles while the remaining circles were hollow (much like major cities are differentiated on a typical map). The user could mouse click on a circle representing any telephone number in order to obtain subscriber information and, via automatic color alterations, quickly discern its connectivity patterns. This eliminated the use of drawing lines which could easily decimate the viewability and affordable information of populous maps. Figure 2. Same data entry point as figure 1, showing subscriber information . Subscription data for others can easily be retrieved Figure 3. Origami allows an observer to easily specify at least three, non-colinear points creating a least-squares circle to down select from the entire database all necessary entries to focus analysis on clusters that attract interest. In the given data set, six independent maps resulted. By this we mean that telephones depicted on any single map have no communication with any telephone in any of the other maps. Also, the maps shared several curious traits. All six maps all manifested a group of tightly clustered telephones near the center portion (which were richly populated with phones of interest). A largely vacant region surrounded the center cluster. Beyond the vacant region was a scattering of phones which were also positioned in ring-like fashion. All of these results were obtained with no human guidance, input, or a query of any kind.

The agency supplying the data had randomly shuffled court sanctioned PEN register data collected tirn six independent investigations.  X  X elephone numbers of Interest X  belonged to known criminals and suspects. The cluster in the center of each map corresponded to all the members of the criminal organization. The numbers clustered near the center involve the telephone numbers which frequently communicate with the suspected criminal organization. This observation led to many high quality leads for agency investigators. 
The outer ring of phones belonged to persons rarely or occasionally communicating with members of the central organization. Many seasoned law enforcement personnel have commented that what  X  X rigami X  autonomously unfolded on a small computer in one hour would have required months to years using traditional techniques.
