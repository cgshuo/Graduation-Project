 Seasonal events such as Halloween and Christmas repeat ev-ery year and initiate several temporal information needs. The impact of such events on users is often reflected in search logs in form of seasonal spikes in the frequency of re-lated queries (e.g.  X  X alloween costumes X ,  X  X here is santa X ). Many seasonal queries such as  X  X igir conference X  mainly tar-get fresh pages (e.g. sigir2011.org ) that have less usage data such as clicks and anchor-text compared to older al-ternatives (e.g. sigir2009.org ). Thus, it is important for search engines to correctly identify seasonal queries and make sure that their results are temporally reordered if necessary.
In this poster, we focus on detecting seasonal queries using time-series analysis. We demonstrate that the seasonality of a query can be determined with high accuracy according to its historical frequency distribution.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Algorithms, Performance Temporal Queries, Seasonal Query Classification
Cyclic queries related to seasonal events have been esti-mated to account for more than 7% of search traffic [5]. The best result pages for many of these queries change every year, and in some cases such as  X  X s open X  the query itself be-comes temporally ambiguous [4]. Therefore, it is important for search engines to detect  X  and predict  X  seasonal queries and respond to them with temporally relevant results.
Previous work has been mostly focused on identifying sea-sonal queries based on their reformulations, and the frequent occurrence of years in their words. For instance, Metzler et al. [5] define a query (e.g.  X  X alloween X ) as implicitly year qualified if it frequently appears in the logs followed by years (e.g.  X  X alloween 2009 X ,  X  X alloween 2010 X ). The authors rely on the number of unique years and their frequencies to clas-sify query seasonality. Other related work includes modeling the temporal profile of queries based on the time-stamps of the documents they return [3]. Dong et al. [6] used a combi-nation of reformulation and post-retrieval features to train a classifier for identifying seasonal queries.

We propose leveraging time-series decomposition techniques for measuring the seasonality of queries. In contrast to previ-ous work, we do not rely on any information about previous query reformulations or document time-stamps.
A time-series [6] is referred to a group of data points at successive time spans with uniform intervals. The data points can represent any quantifiable such as sale records or temperature, and the interval can take any unit of time such as week or year. In the context of web search, one can generate a time-series for each query according to its past frequency at uniform intervals. That is, each data point in the time-series represents the query frequency at a time unit (e.g. day, or month). Having a time-series we can then ap-ply different well-studied decomposition techniques such as STL [1] and HoltWinters [2] to analyze trends and seasonal-ity. Figure 1 depicts how query frequency history at monthly intervals can be treated as time-series and decomposed by Holt-Winters additive exponential smoothing [2] into three main components; level ( L ), trend ( T ) and season ( S ): here  X  ,  X  and  X  are all between zero and one and can be set during the fitting process using standard techniques such as root mean square error. Parameter t denotes the current time-span, and s specifies the length of the seasonal cycle (12 in our experiments).  X  X t represents the value of the data point at time t (here, the monthly frequency of the query).
For seasonal queries, the season component ( S ) is the most significant factor and noticeably resembles the distri-bution of the raw data. For instance in Figure 1, the season and xhat have very different distributions for query  X  X ritney spears X , while they look remarkably similar for  X  X s open X .
Our seasonal query classifier is inspired by this observa-tion; for a given query, we first convert its historical fre-quency into time-series with monthly splits. We then de-compose the time-series by applying Holt-Winters additive Table 1: The precision-recall changes in seasonal classification for different values of  X  .  X  .90 .80 .70 .60 .50 .40 .30 .20 .10 Precision .78 .60 .47 .42 .38 .32 .32 .30 .30
Recall .49 .68 .77 .81 .82 .84 .85 .89 .89 smoothing [2]. If the decomposed season component S and raw data  X  X have similar distributions, we classify the query as seasonal. We use the Cosine similarity function to mea-sure the similarity of the vectors for S and  X  X . That is, The query is classified as seasonal if the similarity value  X  is greater than a certain threshold. We require at least two spikes at seasonal peaks to reduce the chance of misclassi-fication in cases where distributions are flat or similar due to reasons other than seasonality. Note that our approach is not restricted to any particular decomposition method and can work with other related techniques such as STL [1]. Similarly, we could use KL-Divergence or other appropriate functions for comparing the distributions of S and  X  X .
We evaluated our experiments on set of 259 queries anno-tated manually by professional editors as seasonal or normal (with respectively 74 and 185 queries in each group). We used the search logs of a commercial search engine to gen-erate a time-series for each query according to its monthly frequency between 2006 and 2010 inclusive.

The results summarized in Table 1 suggest that our simple technique can classify half of seasonal queries with 78% pre-cision. Our misclassification cases mainly included queries such as  X  X iss world X  that are cyclic but repeat at slightly dif-ferent time of the year, and  X  X owerball lottery results X  that are related to repetitive events but at inconsistent intervals.
We proposed using time-series decomposition techniques for identifying seasonal queries. Our experiments showed that seasonal queries can be classified by (1) transforming the query frequency history into time-series and (2) compar-ing the decomposed seasonal factor of the time-series and the raw data distributions. Future work includes compar-ing the effectiveness of various decomposition and similarity functions for seasonal query classification.
