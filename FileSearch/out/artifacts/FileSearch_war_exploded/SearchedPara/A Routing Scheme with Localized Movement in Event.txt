 A WSN often consists of a huge number of sensor nodes. But, sensor power is lim-ited. To overcome power constraint of sensor nodes so as to prolong a WSN X  X  system or base station (BS) has become one of the hottest research topics nowadays. 
Many studies on WSNs have tried to prolong a network X  X  lifetime by balancing power consumption among static sinks or nodes. In a uniformly distributed and ho-mogeneous node environment, if static nodes or static sinks are used, energy hole near base station can not be avoided [1]. Wu an d Chen [4] proposed an approach to solve energy hole problem. 
To follow the trend of sensor network development, in this paper, we propose a routing approach, named R outing A ssistant S cheme with L ocalized M ovement (RASLM) for a uniformly distributed event-driven WSN. This scheme deploys mo-bile nodes to help relay of packets for node s along an active routing path in such an environment. The propose is to prolong lifetime of a node N on the active routing path that has suffered from relaying too many packets. The mobile nodes located near N gate N X  X  energy consumption speed. Experimental results show that RASLM can effectively prolong lifetime of a WSN for a uniformly distributed event-driven WSN. In the following, we use energy consumption rate and workload interchangeably, even though someone defines them differently. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces background and related work of the paper. In section 3, we explain the preliminaries used in this study. Section 4 presents the detail of RASLM scheme. The performance of the proposed future work. In this section, we classify studies relevant to mobility of wireless sensor networks into two categories, those based on mobile sinks (base stations), and those based on mobile nodes. 2.1 Mobile Sinks Many researchers have tried to improve a WSN X  X  lifetime by using single or multiple mobile sinks. Wu et al. [2] proposed a method called Dual Sink which combines mo-bile and static sinks to change routing destination. A node forwards packets to one of the sinks based on distance between it and the sinks. This approach truly extends the the routing path. Wang et al. [5] proposed an optimal predefined mobility trajectory of the base station to balance the energy cons umption of sensors in event-driven WSNs. However, the two approaches are all developed on static sensor environments. 2.2 Mobile Sensor Nodes consumption problem for WSNs. Yang et al. [3] proposed a local load balance solu-tion by modifying the Hungarian-method-based optimal solution, and integrating with movement assisted sensors to redeploy their positions into a balanced grid. Leu et al. out-neighbors and other outer coronas to prolong system life. Energy consumption in an event-driven environment and in a message-evenly-generated mental data only when they are triggered by external events or by user commands. stream nodes. In a message-evenly-generated environment, nodes generate packets periodically with the same sensing rate. In both environments, nodes close to base sta-tion should relay packets for those far away, consequentially resulting in an energy hole. sensor in an event-driven but uniformly distributed environment may consume. 3.1 Event-Driven Environments In such a network, sensors, e.g., nodes A, B, D and W shown in Fig. 1, might be trig-gered at the same time. They forward data packets/messages to the base station through The packets it generates need to be relayed six times before they can arrive at the base mitting its packets, also relays packets generated by nodes A and B. Node B does the same, but it only relays packets for node A. The workload and power consumption of removed, and the source node stops sending packets, P will be in an inactive state. 3.2 Energy Hole Problem and Non-surveillant Zones Basically, in an event-driven WSN, if nodes triggered by events, e.g., nodes A and B, continue to transmit their sensing data to the base station through one or several rout-ing paths, nodes on the path but near the base station, like nodes E and F in Fig.1, will die soon, producing a non-surveillant zone (NSZ). Situation becomes worse when nodes E and F are articulation nodes. An articulation node is a node that joins at least two upstream paths and at least one downstream path. This might be very dangerous for critical monitoring missions, such as fire monitoring and detection, and chemi-cal/nuclear reaction detection. So, to prolo ng the lifetime of an event-driven WSN, we have to first reduce energy consumed by articulation nodes. The nodes are very often not far away from the base station. 
In this study, a node computes its energy consumption rate periodically. A node N time and of course the WSN X  X  lifetime can be effectively prolonged. 3.3 Mobility Models To reduce the probability of forming NSZ or energy holes in an event-driven WSN, we assume that when events occur, all it s sensors are able to move to accurate posi-tions by themselves. We use the mobility model of sensors similar to that defined by Chellappan et al. in [7] to migrate sensors. In this model, sensor mobility is something like a flip, and the authors assumed that a sensor could move from its current position during flips, external agents launching sensors, etc, implying this sensor X  X  movement consumes no battery energy of its own. In the following, we would like to introduce how RASLM prolongs lifetime of an articulation node on an active path. 4.1 Effective Assistant Zone In RASLM, when a node N on an active path realizes that its energy consumption rate (EAZ) of a node, e.g., node y , as shown in Fig. 2, is defined as the intersection region of communication ranges of node y  X  X  immediate upstream and immediate downstream neighbors coming to help it can communicate with both its immediate upstream and downstream nodes. Fig.3 show another example. 4.2 Broadcasting RAPs which comprises two sub-fields, sender ID and serial-number. The former shows who sends the packet, whereas the latter is a number used to discriminate different RAPs. Each time when a node broadcasts a new RAP, it increases its serial number by one to ensure the uniqueness of the RAP-ID. The second field is the sender X  X  coordinates TTL (time to live) value which is used to control the broadcast range of a RAP packet with a higher TTL so that many more nearby nodes can receive the packets and come to help the packet sender. The four th field is a list of direct neighbors which records the sender X  X  immediate upstream and downstream nodes. An assistant node on deciding to help the sender of a receive d RAP packet must keep its antenna work-ing while moving toward the sender. Once they can receive all the radio signals sent thus stopping its movement. This is helpful in shortening an assistant node X  X  moving distance, consequentially saving its moving energy. The last field is timestamp T s round. 4.2.1 Call for Help scale is small, broadcasting RAPs with static TTL, which is fixed to a constant, is not harmful to system lifetime. But, when the network scale is large, TTL value should be call-for-help round, and A N is number of assistant nodes. If the burden is still higher than its threshold, it broadcasts a RAP with a TTL TTL n =+ to call for many more assistant nodes, where n , a system-size parameter and n  X  0, is an integer whose value Values of TTL n + range between 1 and l r RAP with TTL=1 is broadcasted, the maximum number of assistant nodes that can come to help S is 2 ing field. When the TTL increases to i , 0 l i may come increases to 22 come to help S , the new workload of S , Two experiments were performed in this study. The first evaluates how nodes are distributed after RASLM is enabled in WSN. The second measured lifetime of a WSN given different node-failure rates. 5.1 Sensor Nodes Distributed in RASLM System In Fig. 5a, four nodes are triggered by events. They establish four routing paths con-nected to the base station. Node 0 is denoted as the base station. The topology gener-ated after active nodes sent out RAPs with TTL=1, and non-active nodes moved to the chosen EAZs is shown in Fig. 5b. We can see that the RASLM scheme called for sufficient assistant nodes. However, some senders, e.g., nodes 27 and 16, have called for too many assistant nodes, causing unnecessary energy consumption for node movement. 5.2 System Lifetime Measured at Different Node-Failure Rates In the second experiment, we measured the system life given different node-failure rates to further verify the effectiveness of RASLM. In Fig.6, we can see system life-and 30%, because in the whole field only small portions of nodes participated in packet generating and packet relaying. Other nodes did not consume their energy. That is why there were no available values which are higher than 30% at event-triggered ratio 10%. 
Fig. 7 shows system lifetime measured at different node-failure rates from 10% to 50% when the event-triggered ratios are at 20% and 30%. We can see that AODV with RASLM has actually improved system lifetime of a WSN compared that with pure AODV routing, because the RASLM scheme not only called for assistant nodes, but also evenly shared the burden of relaying job. That means RASLM can balance the energy consumption along the routing path even some heavy burden nodes exist. In the paper, we have addressed the energy hole problem which may occur both in message-evenly-generated sensing environment, and event-driven wireless sensor networks. This problem may cause some other problems, such as fire alarms can not be sent to administrators, and collected data can not arrive at its destination database. Therefore, we propose a routing support scheme named RASLM which can prolong lifetimes of uniformly distributed event-driven WSNs by using mobile nodes that share relay burden with nodes along an active path so as to prevent these nodes from base station safely and smoothly. In the future, we would like to analyze the reliability and performance models for RASLM so users can predict how reliable the system is and what the behavior the system may perform is.
