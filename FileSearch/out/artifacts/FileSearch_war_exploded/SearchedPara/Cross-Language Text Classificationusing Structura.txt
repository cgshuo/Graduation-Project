 This paper deals with cross-language text classifi-cation problems. The solution of such problems requires the transfer of classification knowledge between two languages. Stated precisely: We are given a text classification task  X  in a target lan-guage T for which no labeled documents are avail-able.  X  may be a spam filtering task, a topic cate-gorization task, or a sentiment classification task. In addition, we are given labeled documents for the identical task in a different source language S .
Such type of cross-language text classification problems are addressed by constructing a clas-sifier f S with training documents written in S and by applying f S to unlabeled documents writ-ten in T . For the application of f S under lan-guage T different approaches are current practice: machine translation of unlabeled documents from T to S , dictionary-based translation of unlabeled documents from T to S , or language-independent concept modeling by means of comparable cor-pora. The mentioned approaches have their pros and cons, some of which are discussed below.
Here we propose a different approach to cross-language text classification which adopts ideas from the field of multi-task learning (Ando and Zhang, 2005a). Our approach builds upon struc-tural correspondence learning, SCL, a recently proposed theory for domain adaptation in the field of natural language processing (Blitzer et al., 2006).

Similar to SCL, our approach induces corre-spondences among the words from both languages by means of a small number of so-called pivots . In our context a pivot is a pair of words, { w S ,w T } , from the source language S and the target lan-guage T , which possess a similar semantics. Test-ing the occurrence of w S or w T in a set of unla-beled documents from S and T yields two equiv-alence classes across these languages: one class contains the documents where either w S or w T oc-cur, the other class contains the documents where neither w S nor w T occur. Ideally, a pivot splits the set of unlabeled documents with respect to the semantics that is associated with { w S ,w T } . The correlation between w S or w T and other words w , w 6 X  { w S ,w T } is modeled by a linear classifier, which then is used as a language-independent pre-dictor for the two equivalence classes. As we will see, a small number of pivots can capture a suffi-ciently large part of the correspondences between S and T in order to (1) construct a cross-lingual representation and (2) learn a classifier f ST for the task  X  that operates on this representation. Several advantages follow from our approach:  X  Task specificity. The approach exploits the  X  Efficiency in terms of linguistic resources.  X  Efficiency in terms of computing resources. Contributions Our contributions to the outlined field are threefold: First, the identification and uti-lization of the theory of SCL to cross-language text classification, which has, to the best of our knowledge, not been investigated before. Sec-ond, the further development and adaptation of SCL towards a technology that is competitive with the state-of-the-art in cross-language text classifi-cation. Third, an in-depth analysis with respect to important hyperparameters such as the ratio of labeled and unlabeled documents, the number of pivots, and the optimum dimensionality of the cross-lingual representation. In this connection we compile extensive corpora in the languages En-glish, German, French, and Japanese, and for dif-ferent sentiment classification tasks.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 surveys related work. Section 3 states the termi-nology for cross-language text classification. Sec-tion 4 describes our main contribution, a new ap-proach to cross-language text classification based on structural correspondence learning. Section 5 presents experimental results in the context of cross-language sentiment classification. Cross-Language Text Classification Bel et al. (2003) belong to the first who explicitly consid-ered the problem of cross-language text classi-fication. Their research, however, is predated by work in cross-language information retrieval, CLIR, where similar problems are addressed (Oard, 1998). Traditional approaches to cross-language text classification and CLIR use linguis-tic resources such as bilingual dictionaries or par-allel corpora to induce correspondences between two languages (Lavrenko et al., 2002; Olsson et al., 2005). Dumais et al. (1997) is considered as seminal work in CLIR: they propose a method which induces semantic correspondences between two languages by performing latent semantic anal-ysis, LSA, on a parallel corpus. Li and Taylor (2007) improve upon this method by employing kernel canonical correlation analysis, CCA, in-stead of LSA. The major limitation of these ap-proaches is their computational complexity and, in particular, the dependence on a parallel cor-pus, which is hard to obtain X  X specially for less resource-rich languages. Gliozzo and Strappar-ava (2005) circumvent the dependence on a par-allel corpus by using so-called multilingual do-main models, which can be acquired from com-parable corpora in an unsupervised manner. In (Gliozzo and Strapparava, 2006) they show for particular tasks that their approach can achieve a performance close to that of monolingual text clas-sification.

Recent work in cross-language text classifica-tion focuses on the use of automatic machine translation technology. Most of these methods in-volve two steps: (1) translation of the documents into the source or the target language, and (2) di-mensionality reduction or semi-supervised learn-ing to reduce the noise introduced by the ma-chine translation. Methods which follow this two-step approach include the EM-based approach by Rigutini et al. (2005), the CCA approach by For-tuna and Shawe-Taylor (2005), the information bottleneck approach by Ling et al. (2008), and the co-training approach by Wan (2009).
 Domain Adaptation Domain adaptation refers to the problem of adapting a statistical classifier trained on data from one (or more) source domains (e.g., newswire texts) to a different target domain (e.g., legal texts). In the basic domain adaptation setting we are given labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain, and the goal is to train a classifier for the target domain. Beyond this setting one can further dis-tinguish whether a small amount of labeled data from the target domain is available (Daume, 2007; Finkel and Manning, 2009) or not (Blitzer et al., 2006; Jiang and Zhai, 2007). The latter setting is referred to as unsupervised domain adaptation.
Note that, cross-language text classification can be cast as an unsupervised domain adapta-tion problem by considering each language as a separate domain. Blitzer et al. (2006) propose an effective algorithm for unsupervised domain adaptation, called structural correspondence learn-ing. First, SCL identifies features that general-ize across domains, which the authors call pivots. SCL then models the correlation between the piv-ots and all other features by training linear clas-sifiers on the unlabeled data from both domains. This information is used to induce correspon-dences among features from the different domains and to learn a shared representation that is mean-ingful across both domains. SCL is related to the structural learning paradigm introduced by Ando and Zhang (2005a). The basic idea of structural learning is to constrain the hypothesis space of a learning task by considering multiple different but related tasks on the same input space. Ando and Zhang (2005b) present a semi-supervised learning method based on this paradigm, which generates related tasks from unlabeled data. Quattoni et al. (2007) apply structural learning to image classifi-cation in settings where little labeled data is given. This section introduces basic models and termi-nology.

In standard text classification, a document d is represented under the bag-of-words model as |
V | -dimensional feature vector x  X  X , where V , the vocabulary, denotes an ordered set of words, x i in d , and X is an inner product space. D S denotes the training set and comprises tuples of the form ( x ,y ) , which associate a feature vector x  X  X with a class label y  X  Y . The goal is to find a classifier f : X  X  Y that predicts the la-bels of new, previously unseen documents. With-out loss of generality we restrict ourselves to bi-nary classification problems and linear classifiers, i.e., Y = { +1, -1 } and f ( x ) = sign ( w T x ) . w is a weight vector that parameterizes the classifier, [  X  ] T denotes the matrix transpose. The computation of w from D S is referred to as model estimation or training. A common choice for w is given by a vector w  X  that minimizes the regularized training error: w  X  = argmin
L is a loss function that measures the quality of the classifier,  X  is a non-negative regulariza-tion parameter that penalizes model complexity, and k w k 2 = w T w . Different choices for L entail different classifier types; e.g., when choosing the hinge loss function for L one obtains the popular Support Vector Machine classifier (Zhang, 2004).
Standard text classification distinguishes be-tween labeled (training) documents and unlabeled (test) documents. Cross-language text classifica-tion poses an extra constraint in that training doc-uments and test documents are written in different languages. Here, the language of the training doc-uments is referred to as source language S , and the language of the test documents is referred to as target language T . The vocabulary V divides into V
S and V T , called vocabulary of the source lan-guage and vocabulary of the target language, with V set and the test set map on two non-overlapping regions of the feature space. Thus, a linear classi-fier f S trained on D S associates non-zero weights only with words from V S , which in turn means that f
S cannot be used to classify documents written in T .

One way to overcome this  X  X eature barrier X  is to find a cross-lingual representation for docu-ments written in S and T , which enables the trans-fer of classification knowledge between the two languages. Intuitively, one can understand such a cross-lingual representation as a concept space that underlies both languages. In the following, we will use  X  to denote a map that associates the original | V | -dimensional representation of a doc-ument d written in S or T with its cross-lingual representation. Once such a mapping is found the cross-language text classification problem reduces to a standard classification problem in the cross-lingual space. Note that the existing methods for cross-language text classification can be character-ized by the way  X  is constructed. For instance, cross-language latent semantic indexing (Dumais et al., 1997) and cross-language explicit semantic analysis (Potthast et al., 2008) estimate  X  using a parallel corpus. Other methods use linguistic re-sources such as a bilingual dictionary to obtain  X  (Bel et al., 2003; Olsson et al., 2005). We now present a novel method for learning a map  X  by exploiting relations from unlabeled doc-uments written in S and T . The proposed method, which we call cross-language structural corre-spondence learning, CL-SCL, addresses the fol-lowing learning setup (see also Figure 1):  X  Given a set of labeled training documents D  X  In addition to the labeled training docu- X  Finally, we are given a budget of calls to a CL-SCL comprises three steps: In the first step, CL-SCL selects word pairs { w S ,w T } , called piv-ots, where w S  X  V S and w T  X  V T . Pivots have to satisfy the following conditions: Confidence Both words, w S and w T , are predic-Support Both words, w S and w T , occur fre-
The confidence condition ensures that, in the second step of CL-SCL, only those correlations are modeled that are useful for discriminative learning. The support condition, on the other hand, ensures that these correlations can be es-timated accurately. Considering our sentiment classification example, the word pair { excellent S , exzellent T } satisfies both conditions: (1) the words are strong indicators of positive sentiment, Figure 1: The document sets underlying CL-SCL. The subscripts S , T , and u designate  X  X ource lan-guage X ,  X  X arget language X , and  X  X nlabeled X . and (2) the words occur frequently in book reviews from both languages. Note that the support of w S and w T can be determined from the unlabeled data D u . The confidence, however, can only be deter-mined for w S since the setting gives us access to labeled data from S only.

We use the following heuristic to form an or-dered set P of pivots: First, we choose a subset V
P from the source vocabulary V S , which contains those words with the highest mu-tual information with respect to the class label of the target task in D S . Second, for each word w cabulary V T by querying the translation oracle; we refer to the resulting set of word pairs as the can-didate pivots, P 0 :
We then enforce the support condition by elim-inating in P 0 all candidate pivots { w S ,w T } where the document frequency of w S in D S ,u or of w T in D T ,u is smaller than some threshold  X  : Let m denote | P | , the number of pivots.

In the second step, CL-SCL models the corre-lations between each pivot { w S ,w T } X  P and all other words w  X  V \{ w S ,w T } . This is done by training linear classifiers that predict whether or not w S or w T occur in a document, based on the other words. For this purpose a training set D l is created for each pivot p l  X  P :
MASK ( x ,p l ) is a function that returns a copy of x where the components associated with the two words in p l are set to zero X  X hich is equivalent to removing these words from the feature space. ( x ,p l ) returns +1 if one of the components of x associated with the words in p l is non-zero and -1 otherwise. For each D l a linear classifier, charac-terized by the parameter vector w l , is trained by minimizing Equation (1) on D l . Note that each training set D l contains documents from both lan-guages. Thus, for a pivot p l = { w S ,w T } the vec-tor w l captures both the correlation between w S and V S \ { w S } and the correlation between w T and V T \{ w T } .

In the third step, CL-SCL identifies correlations across pivots by computing the singular value de-composition of the | V | X  m -dimensional parameter matrix W , W = w 1 ... w m :
Recall that W encodes the correlation structure between pivot and non-pivot words in the form of multiple linear classifiers. Thus, the columns of U identify common substructures among these classifiers. Choosing the columns of U associated with the largest singular values yields those sub-structures that capture most of the correlation in W . We define  X  as those columns of U that are associated with the k largest singular values: Algorithm 1 summarizes the three steps of CL-SCL. At training and test time, we apply the pro-jection  X  to each input instance x . The vector v  X  that minimizes the regularized training error for D
S in the projected space is defined as follows: v  X  = argmin
The resulting classifier f ST , which will operate in the cross-lingual setting, is defined as follows: 4.1 An Alternative View of CL-SCL An alternative view of cross-language structural correspondence learning is provided by the frame-work of structural learning (Ando and Zhang, 2005a). The basic idea of structural learning is Algorithm 1 CL-SCL to constrain the hypothesis space, i.e., the space of possible weight vectors, of the target task by con-sidering multiple different but related prediction tasks. In our context these auxiliary tasks are rep-resented by the pivot predictors, i.e., the columns of W . Each column vector w l can be considered as a linear classifier which performs well in both languages. I.e., we regard the column space of W as an approximation to the subspace of bilingual classifiers . By computing SVD ( W ) one obtains a compact representation of this column space in the form of an orthonormal basis  X  T .

The subspace is used to constrain the learning of the target task by restricting the weight vector w to lie in the subspace defined by  X  T . Following Ando and Zhang (2005a) and Quattoni et al. (2007) we choose w for the target task to be w  X  =  X  T v  X  , where v  X  is defined as follows:
Since (  X  T v ) T = v T  X  it follows that this view of CL-SCL corresponds to the induction of a new feature space given by Equation 2. We evaluate CL-SCL for the task of cross-language sentiment classification using English as source language and German, French, and Japanese as target languages. Special emphasis is put on corpus construction, determination of upper bounds and baselines, and a sensitivity analysis of important hyperparameters. All data described in the following is publicly available from our project website. 1 5.1 Dataset and Preprocessing We compiled a new dataset for cross-language sentiment classification by crawling product re-views from Amazon. { de | fr | co.jp } . The crawled part of the corpus contains more than 4 million reviews in the three languages German, French, and Japanese. The corpus is extended with En-glish product reviews provided by Blitzer et al. (2007). Each review contains a category label, a title, the review text, and a rating of 1-5 stars. Following Blitzer et al. (2007) a review with &gt; 3 ( &lt; 3) stars is labeled as positive (negative); other reviews are discarded. For each language the la-beled reviews are grouped according to their cate-gory label, whereas we restrict our experiments to three categories: books, dvds, and music.

Since most of the crawled reviews are posi-tive (80%), we decide to balance the number of positive and negative reviews. In this study, we are interested in whether the cross-lingual repre-sentation induced by CL-SCL captures the differ-ence between positive and negative reviews; by balancing the reviews we ensure that the imbal-ance does not affect the learned model. Balancing is achieved by deleting reviews from the major-ity class uniformly at random for each language-specific category. The resulting sets are split into three disjoint, balanced sets, containing training documents, test documents, and unlabeled docu-ments; the respective set sizes are 2,000, 2,000, and 9,000-50,000. See Table 1 for details.

For each of the nine target-language-category-combinations a text classification task is created by taking the training set of the product category in S and the test set of the same product category in T . A document d is described as normalized fea-ture vector x under a unigram bag-of-words docu-ment representation. The morphological analyzer MeCab is used for Japanese word segmentation. 2 5.2 Implementation Throughout the experiments linear classifiers are employed; they are trained by minimizing Equa-tion (1), using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. In particular, the learning rate schedule from PEGASOS is adopted (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2007), and the modified Huber loss, introduced by Zhang (2004), is chosen as loss function L . 3
SGD receives two hyperparameters as input: the number of iterations T , and the regularization pa-rameter  X  . In our experiments T is always set to 10 6 , which is about the number of iterations re-quired for SGD to converge. For the target task,  X  is determined by 3-fold cross-validation, testing for  X  all values 10  X  i ,i  X  [0; 6] . For the pivot pre-diction task,  X  is set to the small value of 10  X  5 , in order to favor model accuracy over generalizabil-ity.
 The computational bottleneck of CL-SCL is the SVD of the dense parameter matrix W . Here we follow Blitzer et al. (2006) and set the negative values in W to zero, which yields a sparse repre-sentation. For the SVD computation the Lanczos algorithm provided by SVDLIBC is employed. 4 We investigated an alternative approach to obtain a sparse W by directly enforcing sparse pivot pre-dictors w l through L1-regularization (Tsuruoka et al., 2009), but didn X  X  pursue this strategy due to unstable results. Since SGD is sensitive to fea-ture scaling the projection  X  x is post-processed as follows: (1) Each feature of the cross-lingual rep-resentation is standardized to zero mean and unit variance, where mean and variance are estimated on D S  X  D u . (2) The cross-lingual document rep-resentations are scaled by a constant  X  such that |
We use Google Translate as word translation or-acle, which returns a single translation for each query word. 5 Though such a context free transla-tion is suboptimum we do not sanitize the returned words to demonstrate the robustness of CL-SCL with respect to translation noise. To ensure the re-producibility of our results we cache all queries to the translation oracle. upper bound. CL-SCL uses m = 450 , k = 100 , and  X  = 30 . 5.3 Upper Bound and Baseline To get an upper bound on the performance of a cross-language method we first consider the monolingual setting. For each target-language-category-combination a linear classifier is learned on the training set and tested on the test set. The resulting accuracy scores are referred to as upper bound; it informs us about the expected perfor-mance on the target task if training data in the tar-get language is available.

We chose a machine translation baseline to compare CL-SCL to another cross-language method. Statistical machine translation technol-ogy offers a straightforward solution to the prob-lem of cross-language text classification and has been used in a number of cross-language senti-ment classification studies (Hiroshi et al., 2004; Bautin et al., 2008; Wan, 2009). Our baseline CL-MT works as follows: (1) learn a linear clas-sifier on the training data, and (2) translate the test documents into the source language, 6 (3) predict the sentiment polarity of the translated test doc-uments. Note that the baseline CL-MT does not make use of unlabeled documents. 5.4 Performance Results and Sensitivity Table 1 contrasts the classification performance of CL-SCL with the upper bound and with the base-line. Observe that the upper bound does not ex-hibit a great variability across the three languages. The average accuracy is about 82%, which is con-sistent with prior work on monolingual sentiment analysis (Pang et al., 2002; Blitzer et al., 2007). The performance of CL-MT, however, differs con-siderably between the two European languages and Japanese: for Japanese, the average difference between the upper bound and CL-MT (9.9%) is about twice as much as for German and French (5.3%). This difference can be explained by the fact that machine translation works better for Eu-ropean than for Asian languages such as Japanese.
Recall that CL-SCL receives three hyperparam-eters as input: the number of pivots m , the di-mensionality of the cross-lingual representation k , { boring S , langweilig T } in English and German book reviews. and the minimum support  X  of a pivot in D S ,u and D T ,u . For comparison purposes we use fixed values of m = 450 , k = 100 , and  X  = 30 . The results show the competitiveness of CL-SCL compared to CL-MT. Although CL-MT outper-forms CL-SCL on most tasks for German and French, the difference in accuracy can be consid-ered as small ( &lt; 1%); merely for French book and music reviews the difference is about 2%. For Japanese, however, CL-SCL outperforms CL-MT on most tasks with a difference in accuracy of about 3%. The results indicate that if the dif-ference between the upper bound and CL-MT is large, CL-SCL can circumvent the loss in accu-racy. Experiments with language-specific settings revealed that for Japanese a smaller number of piv-ots (150 &lt;m&lt; 250) performs significantly better. Thus, the reported results for Japanese can be con-sidered as pessimistic.
 Primarily responsible for the effectiveness of CL-SCL is its task specificity, i.e., the ways in which context contributes to meaning (pragmat-ics). Due to the use of task-specific, unlabeled data, relevant characteristics are captured by the pivot classifiers. Table 2 exemplifies this with two pivots for German book reviews. The rows of the table show those words which have the highest correlation with the pivots { beautiful S , sch  X  on T and { boring S , langweilig T } . We can distinguish between (1) correlations that reflect similar mean-ing, such as  X  X mazing X ,  X  X ovely X , or  X  X lain X , and (2) correlations that reflect the pivot pragmatics with respect to the task, such as  X  X icture X ,  X  X o-etry X , or  X  X ages X . Note in this connection that au-thors of book reviews tend to use the word  X  X eau-tiful X  to refer to illustrations or poetry. While the first type of word correlations can be obtained by methods that operate on parallel corpora, the sec-ond type of correlation requires an understanding of the task-specific language use.

In the following we discuss the sensitivity of each hyperparameter in isolation while keeping the others fixed at m = 450 , k = 100 , and  X  = 30 . The experiments are illustrated in Figure 2. Unlabeled Data The first row of Figure 2 shows the performance of CL-SCL as a function of the ratio of labeled and unlabeled documents. A ratio of 1 means that | D S ,u | = | D T ,u | = 2 , 000 , while a ratio of 25 corresponds to the setting of Table 1. As expected, an increase in unlabeled documents results in an improved performance, however, we observe a saturation at a ratio of 10 across all nine tasks.
 Number of Pivots The second row shows the in-fluence of the number of pivots m on the perfor-mance of CL-SCL. Compared to the size of the vocabularies V S and V T , which is in 10 5 order of magnitude, the number of pivots is very small. The plots show that even a small number of piv-ots captures a significant amount of the correspon-dence between S and T .
 Dimensionality of the Cross-Lingual Represen-tation The third row shows the influence of the dimensionality of the cross-lingual representation k on the performance of CL-SCL. Obviously the SVD is crucial to the success of CL-SCL if m is sufficiently large. Observe that the value of k is task-insensitive: a value of 75 &lt;k&lt; 150 works equally well across all tasks. The paper introduces a novel approach to cross-language text classification, called cross-language structural correspondence learning. The approach uses unlabeled documents along with a word translation oracle to automatically induce task-specific, cross-lingual correspondences. Our con-tributions include the adaptation of SCL for the problem of cross-language text classification and a well-founded empirical analysis. The analy-sis covers performance and robustness issues in the context of cross-language sentiment classifica-tion with English as source language and German, French, and Japanese as target languages. The re-sults show that CL-SCL is competitive with state-of-the-art machine translation technology while requiring fewer resources.

Future work includes the extension of CL-SCL towards a general approach for cross-lingual adap-tation of natural language processing technology.
