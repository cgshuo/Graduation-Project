 In the social network research, the studies on social influence max-imization and entity similarity are two important and orthogonal tasks. On homogeneous networks, social influence maximization research tries to identify an initial influential set that maximizes the spread of the information, while similarity studies focus on de-signing meaningful ways to quantify entities X  similarities. When heterogeneous networks are becoming ubiquitous and entities of different types are related to each other, we observe the possibility of merging the two directions together to improve the performance for both of them. In fact, we found that influence values among one type of nodes and similarity scores among the other type of nodes reinforce each other towards better and more meaningful results.
Therefore, we introduce a framework that computes social influ-ence for one type of nodes and simultaneously measures similar-ity of the other type of nodes in a heterogeneous network. First, we decouple the target heterogeneous network (or we call it In-fluence Similarity (IS) network) into three different parts: Influ-ence network , Similarity network and information tunnels ( IT )be-tween them. Through IT , we exchange the influence scores and the similarity scores to calculate more precise similarity and influence scores in order to improve both of their qualities. The experiment results on real world data shows that our framework enables influ-ence maximization framework to identify more influential seeds in Influence network and similarity measures to produce more mean-ingful similarity scores in Similarity network simultaneously. H.2.8 [ Database Management ]: Database Applications X  X ata Min-ing Influence, Similarity, Social Network
Two prominent techniques of social network mining are social influence maximization and entity similarity analysis .Givenauser population and their relations in an information cascade scenario, social influence maximization is centered on constructing a mean-ingful influence network, identifying a set of most influential nodes in the network, and maximizing the spread of influence through such a social network. Similarity analysis, as another flourishing research direction, is proposing methods for measuring nodes simi-larities, based on the network structure and node features. Although influence and similarity analysis could provide tools for similar ap-plications, including information retrieval, ranking, or recommen-dation, they are often considered as orthogonal techniques that are studied separately, besides they are often applied to homogeneous networks. When the heterogeneous network is becoming ubiqui-tous, we notice that it is not only necessary but also beneficial to combine the two techniques into one framework because we can use information from one side to calibrate the other side.
Given a set of users and their influential relations, the ultimate goal of social influence maximization research is to identify lim-ited number of influential people as seeds from which the spreading of information entity would be maximized. An Influence network of the users is first constructed according to such relations. Algo-rithms that depict different information cascading rules are devel-oped on the network to explain the real cascading phenomena.
Previously, majority of such research assume that the cascading network is given and so are activation probabilities among nodes [1, 4] which is either a fix number for every node or weighted value of a node X  X  degree. Their major focuses are under different diffusion models, e.g., independent cascade [1, 4], linear threshold [4], how to design the best algorithm to identify the "influential" users. Fur-thermore, they compared the performance of these algorithms on the cascading coverage, i.e., the number of final activated people in the given network. To the best of our knowledge, there are two im-portant phenomena that are constantly overlooked by the previous research. The first one is that they seldomly demonstrate the seed qualities in the real network that are selected by their algorithms. The second overlooked phenomenon is the definition of activation probability. Under which circumstance would a user activate an-other, i.e., pass over the information, is an important factor to the whole cascading process. However, majority of other work simply assume that the probabilities are given and randomly assign these probabilities in their experiment settings. We have only found 1 publication [3] that explicitly studies how to calculate such prob-abilities, and their work is in a totally different problem setting. Our approach addresses the two overlooked factors by introduc-ing similarity measures. In a heterogeneous network, the activation probability between two nodes of the same type is often related to the other type of nodes they connect to. Considering such connec-tions would offer us a more precise way of activation probability model and a better influence maximization result. We also perform a detailed seed qualities comparison to demonstrate these qualities do get improved by our model.

The research community has proposed numerous similarity mea-sures, symmetrical or asymmetrical, for nodes in social networks, which consider node features, link features, and other semantic fea-tures. Also, the similarity measures have been defined over either homogeneous or heterogeneous networks among the same type of nodes or different types of nodes. A simple clue for designing meaningful similarity measures is to customize the definition and consider more information according to application X  X  scenario.
In our case, due to the heterogeneous nature of the network, when computing the similarity of one type of nodes, we should put the influence of the other type of nodes into the formulation. This leads to an asymmetric similarity formulation. This approach has never been studied before. As we analyzed in the above sub-section, introducing similarity to influence maximization in a het-erogeneous network could be beneficial to many key aspects on the influence maximization. Further more, similarity measure gets more customized information from influence maximization side, which should potentially be beneficial too. Our experiment results confirm this mutual beneficial relation .

Similarity and influence computation can benefit each other, which motivates us to study how to effectively combine them together in one framework. Our technique adopts reinforcement scheme on the top of heterogeneous network de-coupling. To be more spe-cific, we first define a special bi-typed heterogeneous network as Influence Similarity (IS) network; We then de-couple its different types of nodes into two homogeneous networks based on their re-lations, and we do the maximization of social influence spreading on the Influence network and expectation of similarity measures on the Similarity network. However, the two networks are not totally separated. There is a latent tunnel connecting them for the sake of delivering information back and forth to improve the performance influence and similarity analysis.

We summarize our major contributions as follows.
IS network is a special type of heterogeneous network with edge features of different practical meanings for different edge types. We have observed that it is generic enough to capture important relations for different types of nodes and explore the hidden re-inforcement between influence and similarity. First, we formally define the generic I nfluence S imilarity network. We then explain necessary concepts related to our model in the next subsection.
D EFINITION 2.1. (Influence similarity Network) An IS network is a directed heterogeneous network G ( V , E , F ) of two different types of nodes, four types of edges with associated edge features. For ease of presentation, let V X be the set of nodes we want to study influence on and V Y the set of the type of nodes for simi-larity research, where V = V X  X  X  Y . There are four types of edges E XX , E XY , E YX , E YY connecting different types of nodes, and E = E XX  X  E XY  X  E YX  X  E YY . F is a feature vec-tor associated with different types of edges. F = F X  X  X  Y F
X = { f X | X  e X  X  E XX } is a vector of variables, each one of which describes the influence scores between two nodes of an edge e . Similarly, F Y = { f Y | X  e Y  X  E YY } is another vector of vari-ables for similarity scores on the other type of nodes.
GivenanISnetwork,itisworthnotingisthatitis application dependent on the categorization of V X and V Y . On the abstract level, the goal of IS modeling is to pick up influential initial seeds to maximize the spreading of social influence on nodes V X simultaneously compute the similarity of nodes V Y , so that the re-sults of the two tasks reinforce each other. However, before ap-plying the model, one should fix the one type of nodes as type and another type of nodes as type V Y , so that the categorization is meaningful to the specific application.

To fulfill our goal to obtain better results for both tasks by cali-brating each other, we propose our framework in three steps. What we are introducing now is the first step, IS network decoupling. As the majority of previous research on either influence or similarity is on homogeneous networks, we want to first decouple IS network into two homogeneous ones and information tunnels between them.
D EFINITION 2.2. (IS network decoupling) IS network decou-pling is a mapping L : G ( V , E , F )  X  G X ( V X ,E X ,F ,E
Y ,F Y )  X  G IT ( V X  X  V Y ,E XY  X  E YX ) , In the mapping, we have V X = V X , V Y = V Y , E X = E XX , E Y = E YY , F X F
As seen in the above definition, in the decoupling process, we first preserve the nodes and edge structures for both influence net-work and similarity network. That is to separate the IS network into two by structurally removing edges E XY and E YX .However,these edges are actually preserved as the information tunnels: G V ,E XY  X  E YX ) . We call it information tunnel, since the similar-ity and influence information can transit through these connections. One should be aware that G IT ( V X  X  V Y ,E XY  X  E YX ) is a bi-partite graph, which only represents the connection between V and V Y . Thus, its edges have no weights. Moreover, E XY E
YX are complimentary to each other. If an edge a X b Y belongs to E XY , b Y a X is in E YX . For example, in a paper-author net-work, that a paper is "written" by an author actually is the same as the author "writes" the paper. Figure 1 illustrates such decoupling process. In the following subsections, we will model the informa-tion passing in details in coordination with the influence similarity reinforcement.
Similar to the state-of-the-art research on the social influence maximization, our task on the Influence Network is to identify k seed nodes such that the spreading of information can be maxi-mized. The influence of z X on w X is often represented by the probability that z X activates w X , in another word, information is passed from z X to w X . Here we follow the classic independent cascade (IC) model to simulate the information diffusion. How-ever, instead of having the activation probabilities on every pair of nodes are the same value drawn from uniform distribution, we come up with a more fine-grained activation probability definition. Therefore, our design is the same diffusion process with IC model with finer-grain direct neighbor activation probability. Let h ( u X ,v X ) denote the probability that u X can activate v in the independent cascade model. Figure 2 shows how we define h ( u X ,v Y ) step by step, where each step is explained as follows.
The major difference between the above formulation and tradi-tional activation probability in IC model is the activation proba-bility between neighbors. We do not use uniform distribution to draw a number and fix it for every edge in the influence network. Other than that, we calibrate the activation probability for every edge based on their nodes X  connections to the similarity network and how those connections interact in the similarity network. Most recently, a study from [3] has explored the way of tailoring edge-dependent activation probability for influence maximization. How-ever, it has no consideration of similarity information from another network, and it has no intention to use the reinforcement of influ-ence and similarity information.

Now we will discuss how we define similarity scores in the sim-ilarity network based on influence scores in the Influence network.
We want to first clarify that the similarity in this paper is an asymmetric concept. The similarity score of two nodes could be symmetric and it has valid meanings in many applications. Asym-metric similarity is a complementary concept to symmetric simi-larity because there also exists many other practical circumstances where g ( u Y ,v Y ) = g ( v Y ,u Y ) . For example, in a paper citation network, paper A having certain similarity to one of its citations B does not necessarily mean B has the same level of similarity with A . In a social network, entities X  similarity are also often asymmet-ric, e.g., the way a song being similar to a video in sharing events is often different from the way a video being similar to a song. Therefore, we model the similarity in an asymmetric way.
Given two nodes u Y  X  V Y and v Y  X  V Y in the Similarity net-work G Y ( V Y ,E Y ,F Y ) ,let g ( u Y ,v Y ) be the similarity of u v . When defining similarity score of two nodes, we explore a similar manner of the state-of-the-art link based on similarity re-search [6] by considering the interactions of common nodes con-nected to them. SimRank essentially considers common neighbors of two nodes as a starting point of their similarity measure. It goes through an iterative process to update such similarities based on the updated similarity values of other nodes in the network. PRank goes one step further by considering in-degree similarity and out-degree similarity in a directed network. PRank also utilizes an itera-tive process because two nodes X  similarity depends on other nodes X  similarities as well.
 The major differences between our similarity computation and PRank X  X  similarity computation lie in two folds. First, we let in-fluence values from another type of nodes contribute in similar-ity computation, in addition to link-based analysis of PRank. Sec-ond, when considering the similarity of two nodes, for each node in one node X  X  neighbor set, we take the most similar node of it in the other node X  X  neighbor set, rather than computing pair-wise sim-ilarities as PRank does. Figure 3 gives an example that illustrates the whole similarity computation. A 1 and A 2 are sets of nodes of in-links of i Y and j Y respectively, while B 1 and B 2 of nodes of their out-links. In our model, g ( i Y ,j Y ) g ( a 1 ,a 2 ) ,  X  a 1  X  A 1 ,a 2  X  A 2 and g ( b 1 ,b 2 ) ,  X  Furthermore, as we see i Y and j Y are connected to nodes in In-fluence network (represented in circle), the influence among u v , z X and w X also contribute to g ( i Y ,j Y ) . We use a weighted sum of two different parts to merge information from the similarity network and the Influence network to compute g ( i Y ,j Y part is another weighted sum of the similarity of i Y ,j Y set and the similarity of their out-links set in the similarity network. The second part is the influence between the connected nodes of i and connected nodes of j Y in the Influence network.

Formally, the similarity between i Y and j Y is defined as follows. g ( i
Y ,j Y )=  X  ((  X  (1  X   X  ) 1 Here h ( z X ,w X ) is the influence of z X on w X ,and I O ( i Y ) are i Y  X  X  in-degree and out-degree neighbors.
Before diving into detail computations, we first briefly review our ultimate goal. Out of many practical demands we reduce a het-erogeneous network to an IS network where we want to compute in-fluence maximization on Influence network and similarity analysis on the similarity network. We have observed the benefit of passing information between these two tasks so that the results X  qualities of both of them can be improved. We have also formulated new ac-tivation probabilities for influence maximization purpose and new similarity measures for similarity analysis. Both formulations orig-inate from state-of-the-art works in these two fields.

From Eq. 1  X  3, we know that there is no close form solutions for each individual activation probability h and similarity score g ,be-cause they are nonlinear, non convex, and mutually dependent. Due to the fact that h and g are intractable, we design an iterative pro-cedure to approximate their values. We also design a pruning and dampening michanism to accelerate the computation. The whole algorithm is as the following.
We use paper collection of ACM digital library [5] as an instance of IR network. We treat the paper citation network as similarity network. If paper A cites paper B , we know that the authors of A have influence on authors of B . Therefore, we also construct Algorithm 1 IS algorithm an Influence network of author relations. In total, the similarity network has 217 , 335 nodes and 632 , 751 edges, while the Influ-ence network has 250 , 566 nodes and 1 , 486 , 909 edges. The num-ber of edges between similarity network and Influence network is 518 , 358 . In the experiments, we compare our model with the state of the art social influence maximization algorithm [1, 4] on influ-ence part and similarity computation algorithm [6] on the similarity part, respectively. On the activation simulation we set the simula-tion times R = 1000 for our method and both baselines (described below). We choose  X  to be 0 . 5 and  X  to be 0 . 8 for the IR model. In practice, our method converges on g and h values after tions. The experiment system is implemented in Java with JDK1.6, Eclipse and conducted on machines with Quad Core CPU with 2.2 GHz and 4GB RAM.
We compared with two baseline methods. The first one is the classic way to assign activation probability in original IC model, which is uniformly drawing a probability depending on the num-ber of edges between two nodes. Despite the simplicity, it does not differentiate any edge. We will show that, with the help of the sim-ilarity network information, we may assign more reasonable prob-ability to each of these edges in order to pick up more reasonable "influential seeds". Therefore, in our method, activation probabil-ities are not uniformly distributed. To make a fair comparison, we control the median of the uniform distribution to be the same as the median of our distribution.

We also see that the activation routes change a lot from the first baseline to our method due to our non-uniformed activation proba-bility distribution. By comparing with the first baseline, we will show that this new activation path structure is more reasonable. Furthermore, we want to show that each assignment of the acti-vation probability on each path is also reasonable. Therefore, we design a second baseline as follows. We first obtain a distribution of our activation probabilities. Secondly, by following that distri-bution, we generate a random number as the activation probability for every edge. Therefore, this generated network has the same path structure and activation probability distribution, but different assignment of each edge. We use it as our second baseline. Since this baseline has the same activation path structures as IS X  X , but ran-domness for each edge, its performance should be in between of IS and original IC and closer to IS because it is IS X  X  variation.
In majority of social influence maximization research, seeds se-lection is the origins of their motivation. However, few works actu-ally discussed what kinds of people those seeds are. We can demon-strate the IS computation generates more reasonable seeds.
Figure 3.2.2 shows the average G-index of our seed list and the two baselines. In addition to the whole area Influence Network, we extracted author relations within three sub-areas separately, in-cluding Database and Data Mining (DBDM) area , Information Re-trieval, AI, and Machine Learning (IRAIML) area, and Computer Architecture and Hardware (CAHW) area. Our approach achieves better performance in overall network and sub-area networks. We also have similar result for H-index, which we choose to not show here to save some space.

We use k -medoids to cluster nodes in similarity network. Since we have similarity scores of nodes, we plug those scores as similar-ity measure into the clustering method. The goal is to see which set of scores produce higher quality clusters. We use the compactness of the result clusters as such quality measures. Here we present the comparison result obtained from three sub-areas similarity network in Figure 5. We only show one subnetwork as others have similar performances. As one can see, the similarity scores produced by IS scheme performs consistently better than PRank [6]. The compact-ness is defined by Davies-Bouldin index.

Figure 5: Compactness Comparison in similarity Networks
What we present in this paper starts from an unique observation that combining social influence and similarity analysis could bene-fit each other through information exchange. Influence maximiza-tion problem is an important research branch on social networks. The task of influence maximization is to choose some seed users to spread certain information as wide as possible, given a certain so-cial network [1,4]. However, majority of them do not pay attention to how to get activation probabilities, which is one part of the prob-lem we are solving in this paper. Amit et.al [3] did the first work to attack this open problem. Our work is different from theirs in two ways. First, we do not use any guidance as action logs. Second and more importantly, their work does not consider heterogeneous network and does not use similarity measure to calibrate activation probability results. Similarity analysis on social network is usu-ally based on nodes X  common neighbors or link properties, e.g., [6] Different than most of them, we apply more information from so-cial influence side to improve the similarity measure, which is not considered in previous similarity research.

We have also noticed that there is another work studied a to-tal different relation of social influence and similarity together [2]. They studied how people X  X  influence and their similarities affect each other. In another word, they consider the same type of nodes X  similarity and influence in a homogeneous network. We consider influence of one type of nodes, with the information of similarity of another type of nodes, and vise versa, in a heterogeneous network.
We observe the benefits of modeling influence and similarity together for ubiquitous heterogeneous IS network. We design a method for such modeling and demonstrate the lifts for both sides using a large scale real world data. We believe that analysis on IS network has a promising future because social influence and sim-ilarity studies are two building blocks for many research interests, such as clustering, classification and recommendation.
