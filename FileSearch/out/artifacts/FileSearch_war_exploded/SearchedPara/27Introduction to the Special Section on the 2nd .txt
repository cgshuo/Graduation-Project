 The 2nd Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML2010) was held on Novem-ber 8-10, 2010, at Tokyo Institute of Technology in Tokyo, Japan. This conference was founded in 2009 with a goal of providing an Asian venue for researchers in ma-chine learning and related fields to share their new ideas and achievements. Although the conference is named  X  X sian Conference X , we solicited submissions worldwide and received 74 submissions from international researchers. Each paper was carefully re-viewed by four program committee members and a senior program committee member. In the end, 22 papers were accepted for oral presentation [Sugiyama and Yang 2010].
This special section highlights three of the top application-oriented and multi-disciplinary papers at the conference. All three papers were invited by the PC Co-chairs because they involve system-oriented work and large amounts of empirical research. The authors were asked to extend their papers substantially from the conference versions, and the revised articles went through several rounds of rigorous reviews and revisions.
 The first article,  X  X onceptual Imitation Learning in a Human-Robot Interaction Paradigm X  by Hossein Hajimirsadeghi, Majid Nili Ahmadabadi, Babak Nadjar Araabi and Hadi Moradi, presents an innovative way to combine learning and robotic systems to enable smooth human-robot interaction. In this article, the authors explore imitation learning based on feedback cues and interactive training where they exploit abstraction, concept acquisition, and self-organization of patterns. In their incre-mental learning algorithm, hidden Markov models are used to abstract perceptually similar demonstrations. This work is a good example of integrated systems where the intelligence naturally appears as a result of human-computer interactions.
The second article,  X  X ining Recurring Concept Drifts with Limited Labeled Stream-ing Data X  by Peipei Li, Xindong Wu and Xuegang. Hu, presents a new method for tracking recurring concept drifts in data streams. In their approach, they applied a semi-supervised classification algorithm for mining REcurring concept Drifts and Lim-ited LAbeled data, in a system known as REDLLA, in which a decision-tree model is integrated with a clustering algorithm to predict the unlabeled data at the leaf nodes. Finally, the third selected article, entitled  X  X nsembles of Restricted Hoeffding Trees X  by Albert Bifet, Eibe Frank, Geoff Holmes and Bernhard Pfahringer, also tack-les the data-stream mining problem. These authors consider the situation where there are multiple subsets of attributes available to learners, where each learner can build a Hoeffding tree. Their approach is to build exhaustive ensembles that consider all pos-sible attribute subsets of a given size and that weigh the trees in a suitable manner to obtain accurate classifications.

This set of selected articles from ACML 2010 serves to highlight the sound method-ology of research and application of machine learning when algorithm designs with system-oriented research are integrated. In so doing, it is important to test the data not only in laboratory-generated data, but also on real-world data. The result is fruit-ful research that can be directly applied in practice.
