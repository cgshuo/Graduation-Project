 There is an increasing amount of structure on the Web as a result of modern Web languages, user tagging and an-notation, emerging robust NLP tools, and an ever growing volume of linked data. These meaningful, semantic, anno-tations hold the promise to significantly enhance informa-tion access, by enhancing the depth of analysis of today X  X  systems. Currently, we have only started exploring the pos-sibilities and only begin to understand how these valuable semantic cues can be put to fruitful use. To complicate matters, standard text search excels at shallow information needs expressed by short keyword queries, and here seman-tic annotation contributes very little, if anything. The main questions for the workshop are how to leverage the rich con-text currently available, especially in a mobile search sce-nario, giving powerful new handles to exploit semantic an-notations. And how can we fruitfully combine information retrieval and semantic web approaches, and for the first time work actively toward a unified view on exploiting semantic annotations.

The goal of the fifth ESAIR workshop is to create a fo-rum for researchers interested in the use of application of semantic annotations for information access tasks. By se-mantic annotations we refer to linguistic annotations (such as named entities, semantic classes or roles, etc.) as well as user annotations (such as micro-formats, RDF, tags, etc.).
There are many forms of annotations and a growing array of techniques that identify or extract information automat-ically from texts: geo-positional markers; named entities; temporal information; semantic roles; opinion, sentiment, and attitude; certainty and hedging to name a few directions of more abstract information found in text. Furthermore, the number of collections which explicitly identify entities is growing fast with Web 2.0 and Semantic Web initiatives. In some cases semantic technologies are being deployed in active tasks, but there is no common direction to research initiatives nor in general technologies for exploitation of non-immediate textual information, in spite of a clear family re-semblance both with respect to theoretical starting points and methodology. We believe further research is needed be-fore we can unleash the potential of annotations!
The previous ESAIR workshops, and in particular the fourth ESAIR at CIKM X 11 and third ESAIR at CIKM X 10, made concrete progress in clarifying the exact role of se-mantic annotations in support complex search tasks: both as a means to construct more powerful queries that artic-ulate far more than a typical Web-style, shallow, naviga-tional information need, and in terms of making sense of the retrieved results on various levels of abstraction, even non-textual data, providing narratives and paths through an intractable information space.
The general aim of ESAIR X 12 is not the technologies for semantic annotation itself, but rather the applications and contributions of semantic annotation to information access tasks on various levels of abstraction such as ad-hoc re-trieval, classification, browsing, textual mining, summariza-tion, question answering, etc. ESAIR X 12 will focus the dis-cussion on two of main insights from earlier ESAIRs:
First, one of the main outcomes of ESAIR X 10 was to rec-ognize that semantic annotations are no panacea, and have clearly more potential in areas characterized by the need for i) rich context, ii) for interaction, and iii) for combining dif-ferent types of data. The potential of semantic annotations in this setting is huge, but this may result in our searcher needing to articulate a complex information request in a complex query language, requiring full awareness of the used annotation schemes. It is crucial to prevent that the onus for exploiting semantic annotation is put on the searcher. The mobile search scenario, which is particularly context-rich, is an ideal scenario to push the ESAIR agenda. Processing data from mobile users allows a wide range of contextual information not available in many other usage situations. Besides personalization and geo-positional information, mo-biles have a wide and growing range of locational, mechan-ical and even biometrical sensor data available to them. In an information retrieval situation this allows the system to infer task and situational context to flesh out the topical content of the query itself.

Second, one of the main outcomes of ESAIR X 10 and  X 11 of was a clearer  X  X heoretical X  view on the role of seman-tic annotations. ESAIR X 10 concluded with viewing seman-tic annotation as a linking procedure, connecting an anal-ysis of information objects with a semantic model of some sort. ESAIR X 11 further explored this view focusing on the  X  X xploitation X  aspects X  X ow this can be leveraged to some gainful task of interest to end users. Interestingly, the re-sulting view still allows for a wide range of views on se-mantic annotations X  X ncluding radically opposing views as held in information retrieval (relying on statistical meth-ods modeling uncertainty) and semantic web (relying on knowledge-intensive methods based on certainty). These op-posing views did surface during the breakout groups at ear-lier ESAIRs, highlighting different underlying assumptions, and different modes of information access assumed. Both views respond differently to the trade-off between the desire to enforce a messy world into clean data structures, and the need to do justice to every unique searcher and search re-quest, in a world of partial and uncertain information. We firmly believe that the time has come to delve deeper into these underlying assumptions, clear up under which condi-tions each approach has benefits, and work toward an inte-grated view on semantic annotations for information access tasks. Hence, ESAIR X 12 will focus the discussion on, simply put, an head-to-head of information retrieval and semantic web, and for the first time work actively toward a unified view on exploiting semantic annotations.
We requested the submission of short, 2 page papers to be presented as boaster and poster. We accepted a total of 10 papers out of 13 submissions.

Balog and N X rv  X ag [1] suggest to extend existing work on entity search with the temporal dimension, i.e. searching over knowledge bases where the temporal validity of facts is well defined and the information needs may have temporal constraints.
 Das and Gamb  X  ack [2] investigates the 5W annotation (Who, What, When, Where, Why) of a sentiment/opinion corpus that pilots this kind of annotation in Bengali.

Eklund [3] investigates mapping  X  X nd-user X  search terms to the appropriate medical terminology using the UMLS, addressing the problem of dealing with natural language searches in systems that use controlled vocabularies.
Fujita et al. [4] presents several ways to identify query rewrites based on the click behavior of users, and a topic hierarchy of the Yahoo directory.

Mishra et al. [7] describes the creation of an important new benchmark corpus, integrating Wikipedia with the knowl-edge bases DBpedia and Yago. In addition it comes with 90 SParQL queries based on Jeopardy questions that are con-junctive queries on the structure part plus free text queries on the textual part of the corpus.

Nomoto and Kando [8] address the problem of labeling unstructured documents with labels generated from combi-nations of Wikipedia article titles and section headers.
Sellami and Rodr  X  X guez [9] address the task of measuring the quality of annotations for Semantic Web services, in terms mappings between schema elements and ontological concepts in a reference ontology.

Sojka [10] discusses the semantic annotation of mathe-matics in large scale digital libraries, by augmenting sur-face texts (including math formulae) with additional linked representations providing semantic information (expanded formulas as text, canonicalized text and sub-formulas).
Kristianto et al. [6] propose a framework for annotating scientific papers for mathematical formulae search,which in essence extracts surrounding text and classifies that text.
Yoshioka and Kando [11] presents a system that supports news searches where the user can specify hybrid structured queries involving explicit named entities, news metadata (source, date), and text keywords.
We start the day with a short introduction of the goals and schedule, and a  X  X eature rally X  in which each participant introduced her-or himself, and stated her or his particular interest in this area. Next, we have two keynotes (to be announced) that help frame the problem, and create a com-mon understanding of the challenges. We continue with a boaster/poster session, where the papers from Section 3 are presented. The poster session continues over lunch. After lunch, we have break-out sessions in parallel that focused on specific aspects or problems related to the four themes. After the afternoon coffee, we have reports of the breakout sessions, followed by a final discussion on what we achieved during the day and how to take it forward. The workshop will continue with a more informal part, over drinks and dinner with all attendees of the workshop.
 We thank the EU FP7 Parlance project for sponsoring the workshop.
