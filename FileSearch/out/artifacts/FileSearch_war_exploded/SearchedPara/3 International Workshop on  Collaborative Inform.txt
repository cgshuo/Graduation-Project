 Synchronous, explicit search has so me interesting characteristics that distinguish it from other types of interaction: there is much more emphasis on interaction, as the system has to not only communicate search results to the user, but also mediate some forms of communication and data sharing among its users. There are new algorithms that need to be invented that use inputs from multiple people to produce search results, and new evaluation metrics need to be invented that reflect the collaborative and interactive nature of the task. Finally, we need to integrate the expertise of library and information science researchers and practitioners by revisiting real-world information seeking situations with an eye for explicit, synchronous collaborative search.

Collaborative Information Seeking, Collaborative Search, Information Retrieval, CSCW. Support for explicit collaboration is an essential part of many information seeking activities. Explicit collaboration differs from recommendation systems and collaborative filtering in that the people engaged in information seeking have an explicitly shared information need. Hence, rather than inferring similarities of intent, the system is free to me diate the sharing of knowledge and division of labor [6]. In the last few years, several research groups have pursued various issues rela ted to collaboration during search, including support for awareness [12], algorithmic mediation [14], software frameworks for collabor ation [4], and collaboration through a range of different devices [e.g., 1, 9]. will be given a hard drive with data, and some descriptions of information needs against that data. We expect participants to demonstrate how their systems can be used to help teams find information, and to have workshop attendees try to use others X  tools. This kind of hands-on experience should improve our collective understanding of the possibilities for improving collaboration in in formation seeking. The proposed schedule for the workshop is as follows: 09:00-10:00 Selected presentations 10:00-10:30 Break 10:30-11:30 Poster presentations 11:30-12:30 Selected presentations 12:30-14:00 Group lunch 14:00-15:30 System demos and discussion 15:30-16:00 Break 16:00-17:00 Discussion, wrap-up, planning 18:00-Optional workshop dinner We accepted several papers for pr esentation at the workshop that covered a range of themes related to collaborative search, including descriptions of vari ous domains and use cases for evaluations of algorithms for retrieving documents in a collaborative setting. Morris and Morris [13] discuss opportunities for collaboration in the clinical setting. Handel and Wa ng [10] offer a fascinating look at the challenges of collaborative information seeking over classified documents when searchers are constrained in the kinds of information they can share. Capra et al. [3] characterize various aspects of collaborative information seeking and exploratory search practices through an online survey of 344 people. The algorithmic theme is represen ted by several papers. Assent [2] describes design considerati ons for simultaneously optimizing the user experience and computation efficiency in collaborative decision making. Halvey [9] presents and evaluates an algorithm for image retrieval, and Fern X ndez-Luna et al. [5] describe ways to support transitions between re commendation and collaboration. Finally, Rodriguez Perez [15] describes an interface that allows people to share their browsing activity. [1] Amershi, S. and Morris, M.R. (2008) CoSearch: A System [2] Assent, I.
