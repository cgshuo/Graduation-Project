 The Internet provides developers of connected software, including web sites, applications, and devices, an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate innovati on by evaluating ideas quickly and accurately using trustworth y controlled experiments (e.g., A/B tests and their generalizat ions). From front-end user-interface changes to backend recommendation systems and relevance algorithms, from search engines (e.g., Google, Microsoft X  X  Bing, Yahoo) to re tailers (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Netflix, Etsy) to social networ king services (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter) to Travel se rvices (e.g., Expedia, Airbnb, Booking.com) to many startups , online controlled experiments are now utilized to make data-dri ven decisions at a wide range of companies. While the theory of a controlled experiment is simple, and dates back to Sir Rona ld A. Fisher X  X  experiments at the Rothamsted Agricultural Experimental Station in England in the 1920s, the deployment and mining of online controlled experiments at scale (e.g., hundred s of experiments run every day at Bing) and deployment of onlin e controlled experiments across dozens of web sites and applicati ons has taught us many lessons. We provide an introduction, share real examples, key lessons, and cultural challenges.
 Keywords Ronny Kohavi is a Microsoft Distinguished Engineer and the General Manager for Microsoft X  X  Analysis and Experimentation team at Microsoft. He joined Microsoft in 2005 and founded the Experimentation Platform team in 2006. He was previously the director of data mining and personalization at Amazon.com, and the Vice President of Business Intelligence at Blue Martini Software, which went public in 2000, and la ter acquired by Red Prairie. Prior to joining Blue Martini, Kohavi managed MineSet project, Silicon Graphics X  award-winning product for data mining and visualization. He joined Silicon Graphics after getting a Ph.D. in Machine Learning from Stanford University, where he led the MLC++ project, the Machine Learning library in C++ used in MineSet and at Blue Martini Soft ware. Kohavi received his BA from the Technion, Israel. He was the General Chair for KDD 2004, co-chair of KDD 99 X  X  industrial track with Jim Gray, and co-chair of the KDD Cup 2000 with Carla Brodley. He was an invited speaker at the National Academy of Engineering in 2000, a keynote speaker at PAKDD 2001, an invited speaker at KDD 2001 X  X  industrial track, a keynote speaker at EC 2010 and at Recsys 2012. His papers have over 26,000 citations and three of his papers are in the top 1,000 most-cited papers in Computer Science. Talk slides are available at: http://bit.ly/KDD2015Kohavi
