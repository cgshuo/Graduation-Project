 Most social networking services support multiple types of relation-ships between users, such as getting connected, sending messages, and consuming feed updates. These users and relationships can be naturally represented as a dynamic multi-view network, which is a set of weighted graphs with shared common nodes but having their own respective edges. Different network views, representing struc-tural relationship and interaction types, could have very distinctive properties individually and these properties may change due to in-terplay across views. Therefore, it is of interest to study how mul-tiple views interact and affect network dynamics and, in addition, explore possible applications to social networking.

In this paper, we propose approaches to capture and analyze multi-view network dynamics from various aspects. Through our proposed descriptors, we observe the synergy and cannibalization between different user groups and network views from LinkedIn dataset. We then develop models that consider the synergy and cannibalization per new relationship, and show the outperforming predictive capability of our models compared to baseline models. Finally, the proposed models allow us to understand the interplay among different views where they dynamically change over time. Multi-view networks, network dynamics, social networks.
One of the most important challenges in large social networks is to help users create and curate vibrant and healthy networks of their own [31, 32]. Such vibrancy entails much more than mere struc-tural relationships  X  interactions along the relationships are critical, as are the distribution of the interactions over time and relationships [5, 16]. In order to build such vibrant networks, which can be ex-pressed in terms of interactions, relationships and their dynamics, we not only need to understand how networks evolve structurally, but also how interactions on such networks evolve with those struc-tural changes. These authors contributed equally to this work.

In this paper, we focus our attention on studying this dynamic evolution of a multi-view network [2, 12, 13, 30]. The nodes repre-sent users, while the multiple views fall into two categories: struc-tural association among users such as connection and follow rela-tion  X  the relationship views  X  as well as various interaction types along the relationships including message exchange, content broad-cast and consumption  X  the interaction views . In particular, we be-lieve that the values among linked users are primarily achieved by the interactions along the relationships, not just by the formation of the relationships. Given this hypothesis, by paying more attention to the study of interaction views, we aspire to help users obtain the value from their relationships.

To address the objective of building a good social network for a user, we identify a few key building blocks, which are expressive and flexible enough to (i) describe the current state and the dynam-ics of the user X  X  ego network, and (ii) define what a good network is for the user. The first block represents the ties between two groups of users  X  the ability to specify or shape the dynamics of relation-ships and interactions between the two groups. The second block indicates the association between different views  X  how the multi-ple views interplay with one another. While these two blocks can be used to express both the current state and dynamics of a network, they can also be used to define instances of a  X  X ood X  network. An instance of such a  X  X ood X  network can be one where interactions grow monotonically with relationships.

For each of these two types of blocks, we study two primary evolution effects in more detail  X  synergy and cannibalization [7, 17, 23]  X  among users within a certain view as well as across net-work views. We focus on synergy and cannibalization specifically since these are the two ends of the spectrum defining the pairwise relationships for each of the two building blocks.

Synergy is defined as the mutually enhancing effect that two en-tities have on each other. For example, consider a user x who is cur-rently connected to y 1 and y 2 , and exchanges messages with them 10 times a week. By adding a new connection z , x now exchanges messages 15 times a week with y 1 and y 2 (her old connections) and 5 times a week with z (her new connection). In this case, x  X  X  old connections and new connection are said to have synergy in the message exchange view. Similarly, synergy across views is defined to be the positive influence that two views have on one another  X  i.e. , the presence of either is likely to enhance the value of the other.
Cannibalization is the very antithesis to synergy  X  when two en-tities negatively impact one another. For instance, in the previous example, if by connecting to z , x  X  X  messaging rate fell to 5 times a week with y 1 and y 2 , then the connection z would have cannibal-ized the messaging view between x and her old connections. Can-nibalization across views refers to the situation where the presence of either is likely to decrease the value of the other.
In addition to the pairwise relationships of synergy and cannibal-ization, we also study how a view evolves given available observa-tions in other views. We call this cross-view interplay .
When describing a current network state, or reasoning about po-tential network evolution and try to drive it in a certain direction, understanding the two blocks  X  user groups and views  X  are very important. For instance, in the context of network growth, a user X  X  existing connections and a group of potential new connections may be of the most interest. A good network might involve balancing the interactions in these two groups, i.e. , aiming to minimize can-nibalization among them, or better still create synergy.

Similarly, a good network might concern not only the number of connections (a relationship view) but also the number of messages being exchanged (an interaction view). The different interaction views are important pillars of a user X  X  overall experience with the network, and the ability to shape the composition among views is critical to our objective to create the aforementioned  X  X ibrancy X .
In addition to identifying these building blocks to express net-work state and dynamics with the purpose of building a good net-work, we also propose a unified formulation to model synergy, can-nibalization and cross-view dynamics.

Through detailed data analysis on a large professional network, we demonstrate that synergy and cannibalization exist among user groups as well as among views. We also show that our unified model can be used to predict user activity level and achieve large performance gain compared to baseline methods.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We cover some re-lated work in Section 2, before introducing some notation and defi-nitions in Section 3. In the next section, we propose techniques for make observation on multi-view dynamic networks and describe a unified model for network dynamics. Section 5 discusses how to use the formulation to recommend connections to a user, to help him build a good network. Detailed experiments and analysis re-sults are presented in Section 6, before we summarize our contri-bution and identify future directions. Multi-view networks have been extensively studied in recent years. This is greatly motivated by the fact that many real-world networks are naturally comprised of different types of relations or views. However, most of the existing study on multi-view networks aim at exploiting the multiplicity of views to boost performance in tra-ditional tasks, such as clustering [19, 20, 24, 36], classification [33, 35], and dense subgraph mining [15, 28, 34]. The above methods leverage the redundancy offered by multiple views, but do not di-rectly discuss the influence that views can exert onto each other.
Another line of research on multi-view networks involves model-ing cross-view interrelations. In this area, [11, 27] proposed to dis-cover such interrelations by analyzing correlation between link ex-istence and network statistics. Other related work focuses on jointly modeling multiple network views using latent space models [12, 13, 30]. By projecting all network views onto a low-dimensional latent space, this approach is able to capture associations across different views. However, so far such associations ignore network dynamics, an important aspect of our work. The study in [2] intro-duces a problem setting related to our work, where the correlation in a multi-view network is modeled at different time-stamps and re-lationships (multiple views). In that study, the network at different time-stamps is treated just as a network with different additional views. As a result, network view X  X  contribution to network dynam-ics is not directly analyzed.

On the other hand, the social network evolution has been studied mostly in the single-view setting. In accordance with the principle of homophile [26] from psychology, which postulates that people tend to interact if they have similar characteristics, [22] suggests the topology of a single-view network is correlated to the dynamics of the network. In this study, the use of pairwise topological measures alone is shown to outperform more direct measures in predicting future network interactions. In addition, [18] further shows that topological information such as triadic and focal closure correlates with the change of network strength. The relationship between net-work dynamics and more involved structures in a single-view dy-namic network has also been studied in a real world social dataset [29]. The evolution of single-view social networks with consider-ation of their structural balance has also been discussed [9, 25]. A large amount of research has been conducted for decades on mod-eling the generation of single-view network [1, 3, 4, 8]. The work presented in this paper goes beyond these through the incorporation of multi-views.
To better understand the state of one X  X  social network, we need to holistically view one X  X  relationships in the network as well as the interactions he or she has over such relationships. For this holistic study, here we represent all of these relationships and interactions by the form of Multi-view Network where each view indicates one kind of relationship network or interaction network.
First, we formally define the multi-view network as follows. For a given set U of nodes, a multi-view network with a set V of views is defined as a set of weighted graphs on the shared node set U . Each view v  X  V corresponds to a weighted graph ( U,E where E ( v ) consists of edge ( x,y ) and the corresponding strength  X  ( v ) ( x,y ) for x,y  X  U .

While both relationships and interactions can be represented by weighted graphs, these two kinds have different characteristics in practice. While relationship networks grow as people come to know other people, interaction networks can change more dynamically. For example, in the online social network site like LinkedIn or Facebook, connection or friend network keeps growing as you know more people, but the frequency of message exchanges may vary a lot over time. Furthermore, interactions typically happen around certain relationships  X  news articles and photos are usually shared and consumed between connected users.

Given these characteristics, for practical purposes we classify network views into relationship views and interaction views . We denote the set of relationship views by R and denote the set of in-teraction views by I . By definition, R X  X  =  X  and R X  X  = V . For simplicity, we limit our focus to |R| = 1 throughout the paper. That is, we consider the case that there exists only one view of the relationship networks, which represents some systemically defined relationships such as LinkedIn connection network or Twitter fol-low network. In the rest of the paper, we refer two users linked in this unique relationship view by related users .
In general, for a given pair of users x and y , an edge strength  X  ( v ) ( x,y ) in each view v can change. Such change can be induced by dynamism over time such as special events and seasonal effects. Besides, the edge strength  X  ( v ) ( x,y ) can also change along with the growth of x  X  X  relationship network. For example, if a user forms a connection with the other users who frequently post great articles, this user may spend less time reading the articles posted by users who were connected before. Hence, the change in the relationship view potentially affects all the interaction views. To set the nota-in network view v , at the time N x are all users related to x . We further define as the aggregated edge strength between user x and a set S of users in network view v .

In general, we address that  X  ( v ) N S  X  N x and M 6 X  N x . Therefore, the study of the synergy and cannibalization between new ( M ) and existing related users ( S ) in each interaction view is crucial for understanding the multi-view network holistically. Once we have insights on this phenomenon, such insights can be used for recommending appropriate users with consideration of potential influence on each interaction view.
In addition to synergy and cannibalization, the edge strength in each view of network may change over time, affecting and being affected by the other views. For example, connecting to someone who posts a lot of good articles on the site can lead to more connec-tions because of increased engagement. On the other hand, posting a lot of articles may limit the time to spend on reading the other people X  X  articles. Understanding this cross-view interplay will also provide values similarly to the cross-user interrelation. Hence, in the following section we will not only introduce descriptors en-abling observation on synergy and cannibalization, but will also model these descriptors in the dynamic networks to obtain the in-sights about the cross-view interplay.
We aim to study the dynamics of each network view and the interplay between different views, along with the growth of rela-tionship network in the multi-view scenario. We develop a simple but effective model to fulfill these objectives that allows a scalable inference algorithm.
First, we introduce two descriptors to track the dynamics of a network view when a new relationship is established. In our model, we consider the time granularity of the epochs when individual re-lationships are formed. As notations in discussing dynamics of one particular user, we always refer this user as the source user . When this particular source user forms a new relationship, we refer the user on the other end of the relationship as a destination user .
The first descriptor is total evolutionary rate work view v , before and after forming the new relationship with z . For example, x exchanges 14 messages a week with existing connections. After getting connected to z , x now exchanges 17 messages a week with z and existing connections altogether. Then r For notational convenience, we describe only the symmetric case. Table 1: A toy example on the change of edge strength being de-picted by two descriptors, total evolutionary rate ( r ) and restricted evolutionary rate ( w ), as new relationship forms.

The second descriptor is restricted evolutionary rate which is the ratio of the aggregated edge strength of x restricted on its existing neighbors, in network view v , before and after new relationship establishment. For example, x exchanges 14 messages a week with existing connections. After getting connected to z , x now exchanges only 12 messages a week with existing connections.
Table 1 provides an illustrative example for these two descrip-tors. The leftmost figure represents the state of edge strength on this view. In the middle figure, user x forms relationship with a new user z , and the edge strength changes as well. These two figures display that  X  ( v ) N r
As represented in both total evolutionary rate ( r ) and restricted evolutionary rate ( w ), the key measurement to compute the de-scriptors is the aggregated edge strength (  X  ). In practice, a typical method of measuring the edge strength (  X  ) is to track the events related to a certain network view and measure its frequency. For instance, a network view representing message communication be-tween a pair of users defines its edge strength  X  ( msg ) number of messages sent in a period of time. To obtain more ro-bust measurements, aggregation on a long period of time such as a month is preferred as opposed to short granularity such as one hour.
However, as depicted in Figure 1, new relationships are formed with multiple users,  X  N T x , over the aggregation period T . As a re-sult, we cannot always directly measure aggregated edge strength (  X  ) every time a new relationship forms. That is, it is not trivial to extract descriptors, r and w . As its alternative, we measure the ratio of the aggregated edge strength of x restricted on the existing relationships before and after a period of time, called accumulated restricted evolutionary rate over time period T Figure 1: For each user x , we use all his related users to indicate corresponding timestamp. We do not distinguish timestamps be-tween the instances of two consecutive relationship establishments.
Similarly, we define accumulated total evolutionary rate over time period T as
Once we have these two accumulated descriptors for each net-work view, we can obtain insight about synergy and cannibaliza-tion among user groups and across network views. For instance, we are able to quantify the interrelation between two user groups  X  existing related users and new related users  X  on that network view. relationship establishment draws the reduction of the aggregated edge strength restricted on existing related users (  X  ( v ) W
N x ( x ; T ) &gt; 1 , then synergy is introduced by the new relation-ships, i.e.,  X  ( v ) ( x,N x ) is boosted by the new relationships. Fur-thermore, by studying the correlation of the descriptors in different network views we can represent and observe the cross-view inter-relation. We present detailed approaches to identifying synergy and cannibalization within real-world cases in Section 6.2.
With aforementioned typical situation on the aggregated edge strength (  X  ), we develop the models on the restricted evolutionary rate ( w ) and total evolutionary rate ( r ), with the following objec-tives. First, we aim to infer the evolutionary rates through learning the models. Second, the models should be able to capture the cross-view interplay. Third, the models must be scalable so as to be applied to large multi-view social networks. In this section, we present the detailed model for w .

Considering the three objectives, we assume the log-normality in the generative process of w . We will validate this assumption later in Section 6.3. Furthermore, we decompose each w into two parts: the systemic part determined by certain covariates from each network view and the stochastic part represented by the log-normal randomness. Hence, we formulate the restricted evolutionary rate as follows: where g is a function of network view v , source user x and des-tination user z , which takes information from the ego networks of x and of z in multi-view V . For simplicity, we assume a constant variance  X  2 v for given view v . In this formulation, the cross-view interplay along with each new relationship can be represented by parameters in the multi-view function g . We can then obtain in-sights about the cross-view interplay via learning the parameters of the function g .

However, the scalable inference algorithm highly depends on the form of the multi-view function g . To tackle this, we further sim-plify the model by making it additive with respect to each view  X  v  X  X  as well as each covariate  X  (  X  v ) x,z on each view  X  v : g ( x,z ) = X where each covariate  X  (  X  v ) x,z in network view  X  v depends on x and z . This additive formulation permits a scalable model inference, as described in the next section.
As previously mentioned, in many practical situations, our ob-servations are limited to accumulated evolutionary rate, such as W
N x ( x ; T ) . Thus, we need to build the bridge from accumulated evolutionary rate to the more fine-grained evolutionary rate .
To decompose W ( v ) N { z note M k : = { z 1 ,z 2 ,...,z k } , k = 0 , 1 ,..., |  X  gated edge strength itself changes as new relationship forms, for any short time period, we assume |  X  N T x | | N x | and subsequently | M k || N x | , and we do not distinguish the difference in the evo-lution of edge strength introduced by one relationship among simi-lar conditions from which we derive, given T is short compared to user lifetime, mula (2) into (4) as follows: plying (3) as L =  X  X To infer function g (  X  v, X  ) v determined by certain covariates, we adopt maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) [14], which is equivalent to minimizing the weighted sum of squared residuals in our case min
For the form of each covariate function g (  X  v, X  ) v , we use the piece-wise linear function on each covariate  X  (  X  v ) . This formulation main-tains the scalability of the inference algorithm, while supporting flexibility in the covariate function beyond monotonic relationship.
We partition the range of each covariate  X  (  X  v ) into multiple seg-ments, denote b (  X  v, X  ) i the lower boundary of the i -th segment, and let the i -th feature be where 1 [  X  ] is the indicator function. For each covariate  X  bining features derived from all segments yields a feature map-for all covariates in all network views, we get a feature function ( x,z ) 7 X  f ( x,z ) . With this feature function on covariates derived across all network views, g v ( x,z ) can be expressed by c where c v is the coefficient vector to learn. By substituting this rep-resentation of g into the Optimization Problem (6), we have min which turns out to be a linear least squares problem and has closed-form solution [6], and we call this Restricted Evolutionary Model (REM). Similarly for r ( v ) N Model (TEM) min Lastly, note that the inference algorithm is scalable due to the afore-mentioned existence of closed-form solutions.
Social networking services help users to expand their networks by recommending potential relationships. One way of making such recommendations is to recommend relationships that are likely to eventually be established (henceforth referred as Strategy I ). For example, LinkedIn may recommend a professional the user might wish to reach out to, while Twitter may recommend an account the user would want to follow.

However, the establishment of relationships may not necessarily be the end goal of the recommendation. For example, a desirable outcome from forming a new relationship can be that this relation-ship leads to more interactions and engagement. Should this be the case, the users may benefit more from their relationships and the service providers may receive more commercial value by having higher user activity level. Hence, another way of relationship rec-ommendation is to recommend relationships that are likely to result in most interaction (henceforth referred as Strategy II ).
Note that any type of interaction can be a network view over all users. We can therefore model the dynamics of edge strength for concerned types with our proposed multi-view network framework.
Formally, for given concerned interaction type v and user x , we need to predict  X  ( v ) N strength after x forms a new relationship with the user z . With the Restricted Evolutionary Model, the prediction can be realized by mula (2), and  X   X  ( v ) N x and z , which can be obtained by regressing on features of user pair ( x,z ) . Besides, with the Total Evolutionary Model, the pre-diction would become
If p xz stands for the probability a user x establishes the relation-ship with a user z given z is recommended to x , then according to Strategy I the user recommended foremost to x would be the z that maximizes p xz . However, in case of Strategy II , where interaction is further considered, the unconnected user recommended foremost to x would be the z that maximizes the predicted aggregated edge strength given z is recommended to x , i.e. , Equation (11).

Note that in Equation (10), we choose not to directly approx-stead calibrate the latter with  X  w ( v ) N strength restricted on the existing relationships N x change as new relationships form, which is confirmed by experiment results re-ported in section 6.2.
In this section, we analyze the LinkedIn multi-view network us-ing the proposed methods and validate the methods through predic-tion tasks. This section mainly consists of three parts. First, using the two accumulated descriptors, R and W , we observe some cases of synergy and cannibalization between existing and new related users as well as among network views. Second, we quantitatively verify our proposed models through prediction tasks, which also serve as the most important piece of brick in the application dis-cussed in Section 5. Last, given the verified model, we provide more case study on the cross-view interplay at the temporal granu-larity that each individual relationship is created.
LinkedIn, the largest professional online social network site, has over 430 million users and provides lots of interactions among users. Here we use the LinkedIn data by focusing on three phases ( T = 28 days) of observations: Phase 0 (Aug. 4  X  31 ), Phase 1 (Sep. 1  X  28 ), and Phase 2 (Sep. 29  X  X ct. 26 ) in 2014 . Phase 1 and 2 are used for most analysis on the dynamics of multi-view network, while Phase 0 data is mainly used to compute some co-variates ( e.g. , number of new connections formed between Phase 0 and 1 ) for the proposed model. We then sample over 1 million users who had at least one interaction in either Phase 1 or 2 and made at least one connection in Phase 2 .
 Network views. Multiple types of interactions exist among users in LinkedIn network, which compose a multi-view network. In particular, connections in LinkedIn are naturally regarded as its re-lationship view. We mainly consider the following network views, which include one relationship view and three interaction views:
Note that connection and active_connection are binary whereas profile_view and feed are weighted interactions. The edge strength-between a pair of users is defined over the number of the corre-sponding interaction events in each Phase ( i.e. , for 28 days). For given user x , any user connected to x is also referred as a connec-tion of x when context is clear. Since the problem is modeled as-suming symmetry in edge strength for now, we do not distinguish between viewing others and being viewed by others. The same treatment is also applied to other interaction types if applicable. Covariates and logarithmic transformation In Section 4.4  X  4.6, we introduced the way of modeling descriptors with covariates (  X  and of making piece-wise linear functions on each covariate. Here we show the covariates we use for our analysis and experiments.
Also, as these covariates are used to model the evolutionary rate, r a given user x , we use both source user x  X  X  covariates and destina-tion user z  X  X  covariates. Therefore, the total number of covariates is 4 per view.

To embed these covariates as features in the proposed model as described in Equation (7), we use 5 segments per covariate based on quantile values. However, as degree distributions in relation-ships and interactions are typically heavy-tailed [10, 21], we use the transformed values of covariates based on the following trans-formation function:
Overall, we have 4 network views, 4 covariates per network view, and 5 segments per covariate; that is, we use 80 features for the proposed model.
In this section, we first study the synergy and cannibalization be-tween two user groups  X  one X  X  existing connections and her new connections  X  before analyzing such relationship across the net-work views. Such analyses are made possible by the proposed accumulated descriptors, total evolutionary rate ( R ) and restricted evolutionary rate ( W ).

Network view ( v ) R ( v ) N profile_view 1 . 028 0 . 626 0 . 830 feed 1 . 029 1 . 015 0 . 989 trans_interactions 1 . 023 0 . 672 0 . 818 Table 2: Geometric means of accumulated descriptors of all users ( x ) and of users who form no new connections ( x 0 ).
 Geometric mean reveals interrelation across user groups. In each of the aforementioned network views, we report the geometric mean (GM [  X  ] ) of R ( v ) N riod between Phase 1 and 2 in Table 2, which can be directly com-puted from aggregated edge strength (  X  ) specified in Section 6.1. The reported quantities are all significantly different from 1 (with p &lt; 0 . 0001 ). Note that R ( conn ) N we do not discuss the view of connection here. Geometric mean is a natural choice as each descriptor indicates the ratio metric.
For the purpose of comparison, we also study users, denoted by x , who were active in Phase 1 but did not form any new connec-tion during Phase 2 . In this case, R ( v ) N due to the invariance in the connections. Thus, we only show Each network view grows. For all network views, geometric mean of the accumulated total evolutionary rate, GM [ R ( v ) is greater than 1 . This implies that the sampled users generally be-come more active after 28 days in the sense that they are involved in more interactions. In contrast, from the rightmost column, the user who did not establish new connections actually shrank their inter-actions. This agrees with our intuition that when users expand their connection network, they are more engaged in the social network-ing site, i.e. , having more interactions. In order to engage users in more interactions, we should encourage them to expanse their connection network.
 Cannibalization in profile_view . The accumulated restricted evo-lutionary rate ( W ) in profile_view tends to be smaller than 1 , as shown in Table 2, GM [ W ( p _ v ) N words, while a user tends to have more overall profile views, those happening with existing connections actually drop as time elapses. One can think that the shrinkage might have happened spontaneously. However, spontaneous shrinkage alone can not fully explain such shrinkage. In fact, compared with the rightmost column, this shrink-age (GM [ W ] = 0 . 626 ) is lower than 0 . 830  X  the case when there is no interference by new connections. The lower GM [ W ] for users who added new connections indeed demonstrates cannibalization exists between existing connections and new connections with re-spect to profile_view . We understand this phenomenon in the way that users spend more time exploring the profiles of the newly con-nected users by sacrificing time spent on the existing connections. Synergy in feed . Unlike profile_view , the accumulated restricted evolutionary rate ( W ) in feed tends to be greater than 1 , as in Ta-feed interaction has increased, feed interaction with existing con-nections has grown as well. Note that while W for feed tends to be greater than 1 , it is still not as great as accumulated total evo-lutionary rate (GM [ R ] = 1 . 029 ), which indicates both new and existing connections do contribute to aggregated edge strength (  X  ). We therefore deduce that the feed interaction with existing connec-tions and that with new connections behave synergetically.
This could be explained by the following scenario. If new con-nections of a user bring in interesting articles into the feed , then the given user could gain increased satisfaction at the feed experience and become more engaged. As a result, this user might be willing to put more time and energy on LinkedIn feed interaction. In this case, existing connections and new connections would not fight for the user X  X  time and energy. Instead, the growth of one would boost the growth of the other by making feed interaction a fun thing for this user. Figure 2: (a) Pearson X  X  correlation coefficients between pairs of accumulated descriptors in log scale. (b) Q-Q plot on the logarith-mic value of restricted evolutionary rate ( w ) for profile_view . The strong linear trend demonstrates that the logarithmic value of this descriptor is along with normal distribution.
 Further evidence from correlation of descriptors. We further consolidate the synergy and cannibalization observation over pro-file_view and feed by studying cross-view correlation. Specifically, we compute the Pearson X  X  correlation coefficients of R These Pearson X  X  correlation coefficients can be found in Figure 2a. We can observe that, log R ( feed ) and log W ( feed ) are highly cor-related ( 0 . 96 ). That is, the higher growth a user enjoys in overall feed interaction, the more likely this user would also have higher growth in feed interaction restricted over existing connections. This high correlation is in line with our previous conclusion that the feed interactions grow synergetically for existing connections and new connections.

As for profile_view , the correlation between log R ( p _ v ) log W ( p _ v ) is much less significant ( 0 . 59 ). Together with previous tion exists between existing connections and new connections in terms of profile_view .
 Synergy among network views. We thus far study the synergy and cannibalization between existing connections and new connec-tions. To examine the synergistic or cannibalizing dynamics across the network views, we pose a holistic observation using proposed descriptors in different views by calculating their correlation co-efficients. In Figure 2a, we present Pearson X  X  correlation coeffi-cients in log scale between each pair of log R ( conn ) , log R
Synergy exists between connection and profile_view due to their observed positively correlated total evolutionary rate ( R ). In other words, users who are frequently adding new connections are also likely to view increasingly more profiles, and vice versa. This can be explained by, on the one hand, users who frequently add new connections will have a increasingly bigger pool of profiles avail-able to view. On the other hand, by viewing profiles, users can explore other professionally relevant users mentioned in these pro-files. These professionally relevant users can then be potential new connections.

To the contrary, such cross-view synergistic relationships do not exist between connection and feed , which corresponds to an in-significant correlation coefficient ( 0 . 03 ). We surmise the reason could be, while new connections always have profiles available for viewing, not all new connections would generate interesting feeds. As a result, merely adding many new connections does not neces-sarily guarantee further engagement in feed interaction. The other way round, unlike profiles, feeds seldom mention users and hence cannot serve as a significant source of potential connections. To-gether with previous observation that cross-user synergy exists be-tween new connections and existing connections with respect to feed interaction, we conclude that just making connections may not necessarily be beneficial for feed engagement but getting con-nected to users who can provide quality feeds would further boost the feed engagement.
In the previous section, we observed the instances of synergy and cannibalization between user groups as well as among network views. Toward the fine granularity of cross-view interplay in the dynamic setting, we proposed models that allow us to infer such interplay incurred by one single new connection. In this section, we verify the fundamental log-normal assumption and quantitatively validate our models through a prediction task, which serve as the ground for the application in Section 5.
 Log-normality validation. The log-normality assumption made in Formula (2) plays a key role in building the scalable inference algorithm. However, as the performance on the model inference is sensitive to how close our assumption is to the real-world data, here we validate our log-normality assumption through Q-Q plot.
For empirical distribution of w ( v ) N users who are active in both Phase 1 and 2 as well as make exactly 1 new connection during Phase 2 . For these users, their restricted evolutionary rate, w ( v ) N are derivable from data since only one instead of multiple new con-nections are made during the given period. We draw the Q-Q plot in Figure 2b. The linear trend in this plot validates that the stochas-tic part of our model follows log-normal distribution. Therefore, our choice of log-normal model is reasonable.
 Predicting aggregated edge strength. Aggregated edge strength (  X  ) can practically represent the engagement level of a user on the given interaction. Through prediction task on  X  , we can achieve two things. First, we envision the predictive capability of the pro-posed model, and thereby validate the foundation of the recom-mendation product brought up in Section 5. Second, by quantita-tively validating the proposed models through this prediction task, we support the arguments about the qualitative analysis in the fol-lowing section.

In the prediction task, we aim to predict two quantities for each test user in Phase 2 : aggregated edge strength over all connections,  X  ing connections,  X  ( v ) N important because knowing both metrics will allow us to design the product balancing between existing and new connections. All in-formation available for these prediction tasks is from Phase 0 and 1 . We randomly partition users into two parts, 70% as training set and 30% as test set.

Here we present the two strategies: REM and TEM, as intro-duced in Section 4.6. The REM solves the Optimization Prob-lem (8) and learn the coefficients of the features by regressing on W N x ( x ; T ) . On the other hand, the TEM solves the Optimization Problem (9) and learn the coefficients of the features by regress-connection z  X  X  state on each network view, REM and TEM infer  X  w
N x ( x ; z ) and  X  r grained dynamics whenever one single new connection forms.
Once we obtain the inferred restricted evolutionary rate  X  w REM makes prediction through Equation (1) and (4) by during the observation period, and  X   X  ( v ) N edge strength between x and z , which is obtained by regressing on features of user x and user z .

Similarly, TEM makes prediction by
We compare the prediction results obtained by these two models with the following baselines:
The parameters  X  ,  X  ,  X  and  X  in the above baselines are in-ferred by minimizing squared residual of log-likelihood. For no-tational convenience, we henceforth use  X ( N x ) and  X ( N as shorten forms for  X   X  ( v ) N respectively.

Root mean square relative error (RMSRE) is used as evaluation metric for the prediction task: RMSRE = ( Y 1 ,Y 2 ,...,Y n ) is the vector of ground truth values.

We believe that the relative error normalized by the existing quan-tities is more important than the absolute error. For instance, sup-pose that there are two users where one user has 100 interactions per month while the other has only 2. If we predict the former user X  X  interaction by 95 but the latter user X  X  interaction by 7, then we may think that the former prediction is acceptable while the lat-ter prediction looks like over estimation. Hence, here we measure the relative error metric and use it to compare each model X  X  predic-tive performance.
 Table 3: Root-mean-square relative error (RMSRE) of prediction methods in predicting aggregated edge strength in profile_view and feed .

We perform the prediction experiments for both profile_view and feed , and report the results in Table 3. Overall, both Total Evolu-tionary Model and Restricted Evolutionary Model outperform the baseline models in every network view on each of two aggregated edge strength quantities.
 Between the baseline Interference-Free Model and the Restricted Evolutionary Model (REM), the only difference is whether or not we model the interference between existing connections and new connections. Modeling such interference leads to huge improve-ment in the predictive capability for the proposed REM, as seen in Table 3. This results bolster that synergy and cannibalization exist between existing connections and new connections, as previously observed.

The Constant Evolutionary Model and the Proportional Evolu-tionary Model consider interference between existing connections and new connections by either directly modeling calibration on ex-isting connections or controlling overall aggregated edge strength. However, proposed models still outperform these baselines by a large margin. This makes sense because, as we have observed, the aggregated edge strength (  X  ) over a group of users in one view interrelates with other user group as well as other views. The pro-posed models have taken such interrelation into account.
In this section, we aim at studying how the dynamics of one net-work view would correlate with not only itself but also other net-work views at earlier timestamps. The proposed model, which was verified in the previous prediction task, enables us to study how the dynamics of one view is affected by other views whenever a new connection is established.

By solving Optimization Problem (8) and (9), such cross-view interplay can be depicted by piece-wise linear functions mapping each covariate to concerned evolutionary descriptor, such as r r ( feed ) , w ( p _ v ) , etc. We use the Restricted Evolutionary Model (8) to examine the relationship between each covariate and restricted evolutionary rate ( w ), while using the Total Evolutionary Model (9) to see the correlation between each covariate and total evolutionary rate ( r ). with each descriptor.

With definition in Formula (7), the piece-wise linear relationship
Given a concerned evolutionary descriptor, we would like to know how each covariate is correlated to the given descriptor and how crucial the correlation is. For the former problem, we plot out the learned piece-wise linear function and observe the trend. For the latter, we use total variation of the piece-wise linear function to quantify the significance of the covariate to this descriptor, and the total variation of a function h defined on an interval [ a,b ]  X  the quantity where P = {  X  0 ,..., X  n P } is any partition of [ a,b ] , and P is the set of all such partitions.

Out of consideration for company confidentiality, we cannot ex-plicitly present the relationships with plots and exact values. How-ever, we can alternatively show how each covariate is ranked by corresponding total variation in a descending order as well as the general trends of these covariates ( e.g. , % : monotonically increas-ing; &amp; : monotonically decreasing; %&amp; : first increasing then de-creasing, etc. ). Additionally, we can also present the p-value which reflects the confidence of the inferred piece-wise linear relation-ship. Besides, in order to prevent calculated total variation from affected to much by outliers, we compute total variation on the in-terval where 95% of records are populated. In practice, we exclude the upper fifth percentile for covariates with only positive value, and exclude both lower and upper 2 . 5% for other covariates. We report the importance of covariates by the rank determined by total variation and the significance derived from p-value as well as their trend in Table 4. For each descriptors, we always report covariates ranked top 3 with additional 2 of interests.

Based on the trained piece-wise linear functions, we make the following observations.
 Non-monotonic relationship exists. Thanks to the flexibility of piece-wise linear covariate functions, we can discover non-mono-tonic relationship between descriptor and covariates.

The most prominent non-monotonic relationship is that between total evolutionary rate for profile_view ( r ( p _ v ) ), and source user X  X  node strength in connection ( x - X  conn ) as well as in active_connec-tion ( x - X  act _ conn ). This relationship is descending at first when x - X  conn or x - X  act _ conn is small, and then turns upward.
This is actually expected because x - X  conn is just the number of connections the source user has, and at the time users just sign up on LinkedIn, they could fervidly view the profiles of the newly added connections who are also their friends in life. Note that the more connections one has, the bigger pool of profiles one can view. However, after these users have got connected with most of their friends in life who use LinkedIn, this new connection formation boom will stop. As a result, profile views would no longer be fast growing. However, if a user falls into the upper segments in terms of connection numbers, he or she might be a recruiter, who would be willing to connect a wide range of people without confining to people he or she knows in life. For these users, they may keep ac-tively viewing more profiles. The same scenario can also be applied to explaining this non-monotonicity in x - X  act _ conn . Different correlation to total evolutionary rate and restricted evolutionary rate. For the same network view profile_view , two descriptors, total evolutionary rate ( r ) and restricted evolutionary rate ( w ), can respond differently to one covariate.

The first case is about the covariate on the number of new con-nections the source user makes between Phase 0 and 1 ( x - X  conn ), which is very critical  X  monotonically decreasing, and ranked 3 rd  X  to restricted evolutionary rate in profile_view ( w ( p _ v ) crucial to total evolutionary rate in profile_view ( r ( p _ v ) lateral evidence, for r ( p _ v ) , the total variation of x - X  conn (ranked 3 rd) is nearly three times as great as that of x - X  conn , while for w ( p _ v ) , x - X  conn exceeds x - X  conn and stands among the top 3 .
This makes sense because x - X  conn is identical to the number of new connection established over the previous observation pe-riod. The more connections a user makes, the more energy viewing profile might be spared to new connections. According to observa-tion we have made about cannibalization in profile_view in section 6.2, this means the time viewing profiles of existing connections would be limited. As a result, the higher x - X  conn is, the smaller w
The second case is about the covariate on destination user X  X  pro-file view frequency ( z - X  p _ v ), which is more crucial to r tonically increasing) than to w ( p _ v ) . This is exactly in line with the definition of restricted evolutionary rate ( w ). When connecting to user with high node strength in profile_view , such as a recruiter, who is like to contribute more profile view interactions, the overall profile view interactions would tend to increase, leading to a bigger r ( p _ v ) . However, once restricted on existing users, the interaction involving the new connection will no longer contribute to the ag-gregated edge strength (  X  ), meaning less significance to w Expanding your network by connecting to social hubs. The relationship between destination user X  X  node strength in connection ( z - X  conn ) and total evolutionary rate for connection ( r monotonically increasing.
Users with high node strength in connection , i.e. , number of con-nections, are essentially social hubs. Recall that LinkedIn is a pro-fessional networking site. Hence, connecting to social hubs could expose users to more professionally relevant potential connections, their own connection network may grow as well due to the increas-ing visibility to more relevant yet unconnected users.
 The diminishing returns are observed in all views. For all six descriptors, their relationship with source user X  X  node strength from the same view ( x - X  v ) is always monotonically decreasing. This basically implies the more interactions or relationship a user has, the harder it is to further increase the same kind of interaction or relationship, i.e. , the law of diminishing returns holds for all views.
In this paper, we proposed to study the dynamics of large multi-view social networks. We developed scalable model that can cap-ture synergy, cannibalization and cross-view interplay in fine tem-poral granularity, which, as application, also sets the stage for a new strategy in guiding network expansion. On a large social network dataset, the proposed model uncovered cannibalization within pro-file view interactions and synergy within feed update interactions. Synergy was also observed across network views, specifically be-tween connection and profile views. Aggregated edge strength pre-diction experiments verified the superior performance of the pro-posed model relative to various baselines. The proposed model effectively revealed a wide variety of relationships correlated to network growth at a fine temporal scale. Such relationships could potentially be non-monotonic.

Directions for future work include the use of triadic and pair-wise covariates to derive additional features. It would also be of in-terest to extend the experiments to other datasets and explore other forms of interactions. On the dynamics of multi-view social net-work, another direction could be to model and uncover non-additive joint effects from multiple covariates.
