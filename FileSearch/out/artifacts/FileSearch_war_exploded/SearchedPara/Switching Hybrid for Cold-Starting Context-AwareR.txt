 Finding effective solutions for cold-starting Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARSs) i simportantbecauseusu-ally low quality recommendations are produced for users, items or contextual situations that are new to the system. In this paper, we tackle this problem with a switching hy-brid solution that exploits a custom selection of two CARS algorithms, each one suited for a particular cold-start situ-ation, and switches between these algorithms depending on the detected recommendation si tuation (new user, new item or new context). We evaluate the proposed algorithms in an off-line experiment by using various contextually-tagged rating datasets. We illustrate some significant performance differences between the considered algorithms and show that they can be effectively combined into the proposed switching hybrid to cope with different types of cold-start problems.

Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARSs) are a spe-cial type of Recommender Systems (RSs) that aim at gen-erating more accurate recommendations by exploiting not only the traditional user and item dimensions but also rel-evant contextual information (e.g., time, weather, location) in the recommendation process [1]. Context management aggravates the cold-start, i.e., dealing with new users and new items, which is affecting traditional RSs; in CARSs it does not suffice to have enough ratings for users and items, it is also necessary a sufficient number of ratings in the var-ious contextual situations the system may be requested to operate: the new context problem.

In this paper, we analyse the cold-start situations that can be observed in CARSs. In particular, we deal with: (i) the new user problem, which occurs when a new user is added to a CARS and there is not enough information about the user X  X  preferences to make good suggestions; (ii) the new item problem, which refers to new items introduced into a CARS and that can not be recommended until some users have rated them; and (iii) the new context problem, which was not specifically considered so far, and relates to the diffi-culty of accurately recommending items to users under new contextual situations.

We have tackled the above mentioned problems with two novel CARS algorithms namely, demographics-based CAMF-CC and content-based CAMF-CC, which are hypothesised to perform better in one or more of the above considered cold-start cases, and a switching hybrid combination [5], named SHCA. SHCA switches between these two depend-ing on the target recommendation situation. These three algorithms are compared with two state of the art CARS al-gorithms: CAMF-CC, which is a variant of Context-Aware Matrix Factorisation (CAMF) [3] and SPF (Semantic Pre-Filtering) [6]. We have evaluated all the considered algo-rithms in an off-line experiment on some contextually-tagged rating datasets, i.e., datasets of ratings for items tagged with the contextual situations of the user while experienc-ing the rated item. Results from this study show that, as conjectured, there exist some significant performance differ-ences between the algorithms across the individual cold-start cases, and that the proposed switching hybrid provides a more robust solution to the identified cold-start situations.
This section describes the four CARS algorithms (two state of the art and two novel) and the switching hybrid solution that we have tested in cold-start situations. The | Users | X | Items | X | Context | rating tensor is denoted as where | Users | is the number of users, | Items | is the number of items, and | Context | is the number of contextual situa-tions. The tensor entry r uic 1 ,...,c k is the rating of user item i in the contextual situation described by the contex-tual conditions c 1 , ..., c k ,and c j is the index of the contextual condition for factor j (e.g., the index of condition  X  X unny X  for the  X  X eather X  contextual factor).
CAMF-CC (Context-Aware Matrix Factorisation for item categories) is a variant of CAMF [3] that extends standard Matrix Factorisation (MF) by incorporating baseline param-eters for each contextual condition and item category. It models how the ratings of items belonging to a specific cat-egory are affected by the contextual conditions. We have chosen that particular CAMF variant since it was shown to outperform other CAMF variants in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) [3]. Given a user u ,anitem i ,acontextual situation c 1 , ..., c k and the set of categories T ( i ) associated to item i , it predicts ratings using the following rule: where q i and p u are the latent factor vectors associated to the item i and user u , respectively.  X  is the overall average rating, and b i , b u and b tc j are the baseline parameters for item i ,user u , and item category-contextual condition pair tc , respectively. We learned the model parameters by min-imising the associated regularised squared error function.
Semantic Pre-Filtering (SPF) [6] is a pre-filtering method [1] that, given a target contextual situation, uses a standard MF model learnt on all the ratings tagged with contextual situations equal or similar to the target one. SPF is conjec-tured to better perform in cold-start situations because it is able to reuse ratings tagged with contexts that, although syntactically different, they influence the users X  ratings sim-ilarly. Thus, SPF can build more robust local MF models. In our work, we used the particular SPF variant described in [6], which models contextual conditions as their per-item aggregated impact in combination with Singular Value De-composition (SVD).
We conjecture that CAMF-CC may fail to provide accu-rate recommendations for items that have received few or no ratings (i.e., new item problem). The reason is that CAMF-CC, in order to create profiles for items, relies exclusively on explicit ratings. Content-based CAMF-CC, which we pro-pose here, addresses this problem by taking into account item attributes, for instance, the type of a place of interest (POI), the actors or the genre of a movie, in addition to user ratings. A distinct factor vector x a for each item X  X  at-tribute a  X  A ( i ) models how an item X  X  attribute influences  X  r
Content-based CAMF-CC doesn X  X  explicitly tackle the new user problem. Hence, we propose also a demographics-based CAMF-CC variant that addresses this problem by profiling users through known users attributes, such as gender, age group, personality traits, and so on. A distinct factor vec-tor y a is used to describe a user through the set of user-associated attributes a  X  A ( u ) y a . By enhancing the user representation demographics-based CAMF-CC predicts rat-ings using the following rule:  X  r
We finally propose here SHCA, a switching hybrid algo-rithm that combines the conjectured strengths of the two previously described novel CARS algorithms: content-based CAMF-CC and demographics-based CAMF-CC. SHCA uses content-based CAMF-CC when it is requested to predict a rating for a new item, while it uses demographics-based CAMF-CC when predicting a rating for a new user or a new contextual situation. When a mixture of the elemen-tary cold-start situations is detected, SHCA computes the predicted rating by averaging the predictions of the two con-stituent algorithms. For instance, the predictions for a rat-ing that is both for a new user and a new item is the average of the ratings estimated by demographics-based CAMF-CC and content-based CAMF-CC. SHCA is expected to bet-ter tackle all kinds of cold-start situations found in CARSs. More adaptive combinations of elementary CARS algorithms will be considered in future work.
We present here the evaluation of the aforementioned CARS algorithms, compared with a baseline Matrix Factorisation (MF) algorithm [10]. We first describe the datasets used in the evaluation, then the experimental design, and finally we present and discuss the obtained results.
We have used three contextually-tagged rating datasets with different characteristics: STS [8]; CoMoDa [11]; Music [2]. Table 1 provides some descriptive statistics of these datasets. We note that there are only a few contextually-tagged rating datasets available, and these are amongst the more popular ones.

Our experiment involved three separate test cases, one for each of the three cold-start situations being addressed. In the first test case, we measured the algorithms X  performance for new users by carrying out a ten-fold cross-validation scheme as follows. First, we shuffled the set of users in the whole rating dataset and split it into ten (roughly) equally sized subsets. Then, in each cross-validation iteration, we used the ratings coming from nine merged user subsets as training set to build the models and the remaining ones as testing set. In this way, the testing set contains users with no ratings in the training set (new users). Finally, for each of the ten iterations, we computed the Mean Absolute Er-ror (MAE) of the models, which were then averaged over all iterations to obtain more reliable results.

In addition, we measured the normalised Discounted Cu-mulative Gain 1 (nDCG 1 ) for each evaluation run, using the test procedure described in [12]. We also calculated nDCG k =2 ,... 5, but for lack of space and since they gave similar results we do not report them.

An identical procedure was used when assessing models X  performance on new items and new contextual situations, re-spectively. The only difference was that here cross-validation was performed on the set of items and contextual situations rather than the set of users. In principle, our evaluation pro-cedure could also be used for assessing the models X  perfor-mance on mixtures of cold-start cases, by cross-validating on user-item, user-context, item-context and user-item-context tuples. This would be interesting since the proposed hybrid algorithm SHCA is expected to handle this kind of mixed cases. However, we did not assess these performances be-cause the available rating datasets are not large and dense enough to perform this fine-grained analysis. Another as-pect not considered here is that there exist various degrees of coldness; but we focused on really cold users, items and contextual situations, i.e., without any observed rating.
The obtained results are summarised in Table 2. Not considering SHCA, which is discussed at the end of this section, it can be noted that demographics-based CAMF-CC performed very well in the new user situation. This supports our hypothesis that in this case CAMF-CC can be improved by using user attributes. The weaker per-formance of demographics-based CAMF-CC on the Music dataset may be explained by noting that, differently from the other datasets, where attributes like age, gender, user personality and zip code are available, here only the users X  evaluations of the music genres (e.g., user u likes pop music, giving it five out of five stars) are available.

Regarding the new item scenario, we can observe, as con-jectured, the excellent performance of content-based CAMF-CC, if compared to the other non-hybrid algorithms. It is effective in this situation because it profiles items also using the available metadata. In the new context scenario, again the demographics-based CAMF-CC is the best. We note that SPF performs very badly in the Music dataset because here contextual situations are made up of only one contex-tual condition. This makes it impossible for SPF to correctly compute similarities between contextual situations.
Finally, if we now focus on the results obtained by the proposed switching hybrid approach SHCA, it can be seen that it is able to correctly exploit the strengths (and avoid the weaknesses) of the elementary algorithms in all the in-dividual cold-start cases. In all cases, except for the new user scenario in the Music dataset, it is the best or second best performing algorithm. This illustrates that SHCA, and likely a more adaptive version of it, can become a viable and flexible solution for cold-starting CARSs if an adequate set of elementary (non-hybrid) models are available.
So far, only little research has been conducted specifically on the cold-start problem for CARSs. One direct approach to this problem is to acquire additional information about the users, items or contextual situations. However, acquiring such information usually requires some additional effort of the users and/or service providers. This effort can be mit-igated by employing an Active Learning (AL) strategy [8] or a cross-domain recommendation technique [9]. Another alternative, which we considered in our work, is to exploit a set of metadata describing the users and items (e.g., de-mographics and item descriptions), and to utilise them in a hybrid CARS in order to overcome the new user and new item problem, respectively [14].

Switching hybrid, as described, e.g., in [7], was used in traditional RSs, i.e., non context-aware. From these ap-proaches we borrowed the idea of selecting and applying the best performing recommender among a set of candidate models, based on the current recommendation situation, and hence avoiding problems specific to a particular recommen-dation algorithm.

Instead of acquiring new preference data or metadata, one can try to better process the existing preference data. In fact, an example of such approach is SPF [6], which we have evaluated in this paper. SPF tries to deal with the cold-start problem in CARSs by using in the recommendation process, not only contextual ratings that exactly match the target context, but also those that were provided in semanti-cally equivalent contexts. But, as we have shown in this pa-per, SPF may fail to reliably assess the situation-to-situation similarity in cold-start scenarios.
We must observe that the off-line evaluation of cold-start performance of CARSs is a complex task. This is mainly due to the lack of large (enough) contextually-tagged rating datasets, which hinders a one-to-one application of the cold-start evaluation protocols proposed before for traditional RSs. For instance, the evaluation schema presented in [12] that splits user ratings into four partitions (i.e., recommen-dation on existing items for existing users, recommendation on existing items for new users, recommendation on new items for existing users, and recommendation on new items for new users) by randomly selecting half of the users (items) as new users (items) and the rest as existing users (items) can only be applied to very large and dense contextually tagged rating datasets. Otherwise the partitions (i.e., eight in the case of a CARS) will be filled with no or few ratings, or even worse, with  X  X rong X  ratings as the corresponding training ratings might not be available.

Similar limitations apply to the testing methodology illus-trated in [13] when trying to extend it and evaluate the sys-tem performance not only on new items (the case considered in their work) but also on new users and new contexts. Un-fortunately, the standard large-scale datasets used for non context-aware RS research (e.g., MovieLens 1 and Library-Thing 2 ) are of limited use here since they do not provide either contextual tags, or user/item attributes, or both.

In this study we focused on cold-starting CARSs, i.e., dealing with a lack of ratings for users, items or contextual situations. We have compared (off-line) four CARS algo-rithms, two state of the art and two novel, which we conjec-tured to perform well in these scenarios, and a novel switch-ing hybrid approach. We have shown that the two novel CARS algorithms and their hybrid combination (SHCA) successfully deal with all the considered cold-start problems. We have also shown that the new context scenario is the hardest and more research is required to effectively solve it.
Cold-start in CARSs is still a new and poorly explored topic, and there are several research questions that deserve future work. For instance, can the elementary (non-hybrid) CARS algorithms be adaptively combined based on ratings gathered from users [4]? Additionally, how will the pro-posed algorithms perform on larger contextually-tagged rat-ing datasets? Our results offer an initial support to the conjecture that a switching hybrid approach can be a viable solution to the cold-start problem in CARSs. [1] G.Adomavicius,B.Mobasher,F.Ricci,and [2] L.
