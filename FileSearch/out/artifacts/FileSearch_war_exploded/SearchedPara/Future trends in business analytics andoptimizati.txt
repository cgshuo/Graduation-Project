The key challenges that can be identi fi ed are:  X  The discovery of new methodologies for known problems.  X  The benchmarking of algorithms. What has been done? How much do we know about the domain must be able to improve a particular process so the results are convincing. methodologies and solutions to their problems. 3.1.2. Lyn C.
