 existing mechanisms. The reas ons are illustrated below:  X  may result in medical accidents since doctors rely on data to make treatment.  X  recognized as soon as it occurs for treatment.  X 
Heavy system cost: High cost of the sy stem: The processing and representation of storage, CPU. data quality, we have integrated a Data Stream Management System (DSMS) as data requirement and implement the following functions:  X  application.  X  out the abnormity and trigger data alert when necessary.  X 
Load shedding: Guided by control theory, we have designed load shedding module to CPU availability, we concern more about memory resources. other papers [3] [4] [5] [6]. environment. system. Improving the efficiency of the allocation of memory among query operators system performance when limited main memory is the primary resource bottleneck. 3.1 Data Preprocessing: Wra pper and Filter fo r Data Stream to find the proper xml file for parsing. 3.2 Detecting Changes: Find Out the Abnormal Data Patterns will be announced by our system. 3.3 Load Shedding: Avoid System Crash by Limiting Resource Abuse Various system resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth may controlled variable. rate R(k+1)=R(k)-D(k). prototype system. It has the following contribution:  X  query engine.  X 
A more accurate and faster data trend ch ange detection mechanism based on linear segment and vector search.  X 
Being able to protect the system and ba lance the system load by control theory based load shedding module. 
In the future, the following work maybe our objectives:  X 
Improve the above mechanism based on the semantic data stream.  X  Find out some new applications for our stream engine and extend its scope.
