 Information Technology is infiltrating our lives, greatly changing and improving the way we live. However senior citizens received little attention in this revolution, due to the myth of the senior citizens are not capable of operating digital devices. As more and more auxiliary accessing technologies like text-to-speech technologies and touch screens are prevailing every handhold device. The accessibility of elec-tronic devices is greatly enhanced and attracting more and more older users. In [1] we can see that the population aging is unprecedented, pervasive and enduring, from 1950 to 2050 the proportion of older persons will soar from 8% to 21% and this trend in China is even worse [2]. It X  X  of great importance to utilize information technology to assist the younger ci tizens to nurse their older parents.
To cope with this challenge, we propose our system SmartCare to help younger citizens nurse their older parents or community physicians taking care of senior citizens. Due to the reliability, scalability and computation ability of cloud com-puting service we mainly deployed an online probability graph[3] based user anomaly moving trajectory detection algorithm on the cloud. Conventionally in anomaly trajectory detection, like [4], it considers that for every trajectory with the same source and destination should have the same path. But in our case each person X  X  trajectory is varied even with the same source and destination. The anomaly trajectory of the older person could indicate fraud of various kind. We also implemented a few other intelligent monitoring mechanisms to help the guardians to take care of the older persons. For instance we build a free medicine information database by crowdsourcing[5]. The main components of SmartCare are the smart phone app, the wearable bracelet and the data service on Azure. ( Fig. 1) shows our system architecture.
The wearable bracelet measures heart rate and body temperature of the wear-ing person and transfers them to the smart phone via Bluetooth.

The smart phone app mainly utilized text-to-speech and image barcode read-ing technology and consists of Data Collector, Location Based Alarm and Medi-cation Alarm. The Data Collector collect s the vital-signs from the Bracelet send them to the data service on the cloud along with the phone X  X  GPS data. Lo-cation Based Alarm is activated when the senior citizen is close to a schedule item set by the guardian. Medication Alarm uses text-to-speech engine to speak repeatedly the name and usage of the medicine to alert older person and reads thebarcodeonthemedicineboxtoensu re the correct medicine is taken by the camera on the phone, if this process is n ot succeeded it will alert the guardian. Both logs generated are sent to the cloud and stored.

Windows Azure demonstrated outstanding computation ability and reliabil-ity [6] thus we deployed our cloud service on Azure. Our cloud service mainly involves probability graphs, crowdsourcing and location based range query ten-ancies and mainly consists of storage manager, anomaly detector, diary generator and location analyzer. Storage manage r receives the data from the smart phone and stores the user information on the SQL like tables (referred to as SQL), while the GPS data and vital-sign data on the key value pair like table (referred to as table) on Azure. It also collects the medicine information input by users, our frequency and support based algorithm selects common entries and displays to future users to select the proper one. If an item has a high selection frequency it X  X  considered as true and stored. Anom aly detector detect s abnormal location and vital-sign of the senior citizens. We use Hidden Markov Model to model this problem. First we find the point of interests and consider the point of interests as states and use weather, date, time, pho ne call records as features. We trained an HMM for each user according to histo ry trajectories of each user. When user reach a new point of interest, we predict the probability of this new point and if it X  X  beneath the threshold then it is considered as an anomaly. To detect the ab-normal vital signs by calculating the cosine similarity between the current data vector and the averaged data vector from the previous hour. If any anomaly is detected the guardian of the older person will be alerted by phone or text message detailing the plausible scenario and the location of the incident. The Dairy Generator generates a daily summary of the senior citizen, according to the logs submitted by phone app and the moving trajectory. Lastly the location Analyzer returns the nearby business of a GPS position to the phone app. We implemented the phone app on Win-Phone, and built the wearable bracelet based on sensor modules. Selected interf aces of SmartCare are shown in(Fig. 1).
Our system mainly contains the following scenarios: (1) Monitors the moving trajectory and vital signs of the older pe rson by an online detect ion of trajectory and vital sign anomalies service on the cloud. (2) Enables guardians to schedule the timetable of the senior citizens, and a lerts the senior citizens if their current location is near the scheduled item. (3) A dairy is generated regarding of the data collected on the cloud, helping guardians to know the daily life of the senior citizens better. (4) As most senior citi zens need long-term medication our system also provides a mechanism to assist and s upervise the older person taking correct medicine on time. (5) If any anomalies are detected or any procedure failed our system will notify the guardian for the incident.
