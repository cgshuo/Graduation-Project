 We report findings on how the user X  X  perception of task difficulty changes before and after searching for information to solve tasks . We found that while in one type of task, the dependent task, this did not change, in another, the parallel task, it did. The findings have implications on designing systems that can provide assistance to users with their search and task solving strategies.

 Task difficulty, predicted difficulty, reflected difficulty, task type Current search engines do a good job in returning answers with easy and simple tasks, e.g. ,  X  X hen is the poster submission deadline for SIGIR 2011? X  One can simply type in Google (http://www.google.com ) the keywords  X  X IGIR 2011 poster deadline X  and find the answer from the snippet of the top ranked search result. However, search systems do not do as well with somewhat difficult tasks, e.g. ,  X  X ollect information that is helpful to make a 2 -week tour plan to 3 cities in China: Xi X  X n, Shanghai, and Chengdu. X  The complexity nature of the task as well as the user  X  X  lack of knowledge with these cities and the Chinese culture could all make the task be difficult. Better search systems are needed that can help people more easily locate useful information and more effectively solve such difficult ta sks.
 Task difficulty has been attracting quite some research attention. It is defined as a subjective perception assessed by task doers [4], and could be formed both pre -and post -task [3]. Task dif ficulty has been found to be a significant factor influencing users X  search behaviors and search performance. In difficult tasks, users are more likely to visit more web pages ( [2][3][5]), issue more queries ( [1][3][5]), and spend longer total time ( [1][5]) and first dwell time [5] on search result pages. These findings in the relationship between users X  behaviors and task difficulty suggest that it is possible to predict the difficulty level of a task from the users X  search behaviors. Further, researc hers have found that the relationship between search behaviors and task difficulty varies in different types of tasks such as in factual, interpretive, and exploratory [3], or in fact -finding and information gathering [5]. Even though a system can predict, from observing the user X  X  behaviors, that he is having difficulty with his search, the system or after they worked on them. This was reasonable given that both tasks were in the same domain and their general requirements were the same. A n on-parametric Wilcoxon test was used to compare users X  expected and reflected general task difficulty. Results (Figure 1) show that in the DT, there was no significant difference between users X  ratings on these two ty pes of difficulty. However, in the PT, after working on the whole task, users felt that the general task was not as difficult as they expected in the beginning of the experiment (W(11)=4.5, p=.034). Since both tasks had multiple sub -tasks, it is reasonable to look at the sub -task difficulty for further analyses.
 Figure 1 . Pre -vs. post -task difficulty in individual tasks The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the expected vs. the reflected sub -task difficulty in i ndividual sessions. Results show that in the DT, in any session, as well as in 3 sessions on average, the expected and the reflected sub -task difficulty were not significantly different. Figure 2 . Pre -vs. post -session sub -task difficulty in individual ta sks In the PT, no changes were found between users X  expected and reflected difficulty of the sub -tasks in individual sessions. However, in all 3 sessions on average, Figure 2, users had a
