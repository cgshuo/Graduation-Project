 Citizen science is a form of research collaboration that in-volves the public in scientific research to address real-world problems. Virtual citizen science projects, entirely mediated by information and communication technologies (ICTs), are often considered a form of crowdsourcing applied to sci-ence. The use of ICTs to support citizen science has al-ready yielded significant impacts on the scale and scope of participation and research, but there is little guidance to help projects choose and implement appropriate technolo-gies to support research and participation goals. This dis-sertation study employs a comparative case study method-ology to examine how virtuality and technology shape pro-cesses of organizing and participation in citizen science, and how these processes influence scientific outcomes. The goal of the study is to conceptualize virtual participation by ex-amining the relationship between ICT and practice in order to inform design and management of cyberinfrastructure for citizen science.

Citizen science is a form of collaboration that involves the public in scientific research to address real-world prob-lems [3]. Many such projects are virtual organizations with geographically dispersed resources and members who work toward common goals via cyberinfrastructure. This type of organizational and work design is not new to science; the Audubon Christmas Bird Count, for example, started in 1900. Cyberinfrastructure and ubiquitous computing now make broad public participation in scientific work a realistic research strategy for an increasing variety of studies.
The modern form of citizen science that has evolved over the past two decades places more emphasis on scientifically sound practices and measurable goals for public education than similar historical efforts [1]. Virtual citizen science projects, entirely mediated by information and communi-Emerging scientific cyberinfrastructure projects represent a related phenomenon that bear stronger similarity to virtual citizen science than most collaboratories discussed in the literature to date [7, 8].

Virtual citizen science is a different way of organizing on-line contribution than has been previously analyzed in the literature. Unlike most online communities that have been studied, these projects are not self-organizing [12, 2, 4] The structure of tasks is very similar, however, and existing liter-ature on the task structure in peer production is helpful for understanding key aspects of virtual citizen science [6]. This body of work provides insight into the design of tasks and technologies to support virtual citizen science communities and a contextual basis for theorizing their practices.
As designed, this study employs a comparative case study methodology [13], focusing on processes at the project level. Case selection uses theoretical sampling to select sites for in-depth study. Field research methods permit collection of several types of data, the analysis of which will begin with description of each case and within-case analysis before proceeding to comparison in cross-case analysis.

The study plan includes three progressive stages of data collection and within-case analysis, concluding with a sum-mative fourth stage focused on cross-case analysis. The re-search is currently in the first phase, collecting background information, identifying the boundaries of each case, and developing a foundation for the subsequent phases of re-search. In the second phase, participant observation will be combined with process analysis to characterize participa-tion in each project. The third phase of inquiry will focus the project level, collecting interview data on participation design and project outcomes. Finally, the fourth phase of re-search will use a cross-case comparative analysis to examine the underlying structures and processes across cases.
The concepts highlighted for investigation in the current study emerged from the pilot study, which employed field research methods for a case study of a new citizen science project. The case study site was an inter-organizational partnership for monitoring in the U.S. National Parks in the Northeast region. Inductive qualitative analysis meth-ods were applied to data collected from 17 semi-structured interviews; participant observation in project planning meet-ings and 6 days on site at two of the parks; and 113 docu-ments including maps, protocols, and data sheets.
Pilot study findings highlighted the influence of the physi-cal environment, resources, and cultures; these factors differ substantially across each of three sites, which led to concerns over the potential impact of local contexts on the quality of the scientific outcomes. This recurrent theme suggests a critical link between the research design process and the im-plementation environment. In addition, the lack of strong central funding had the silver lining of relative autonomy, but the resulting decentralized governance also lead to un-certainty about individual roles in the project. Finally, the findings from the pilot study provided further focus to the research questions and established the viability of the case study methodology for examining this phenomenon.
