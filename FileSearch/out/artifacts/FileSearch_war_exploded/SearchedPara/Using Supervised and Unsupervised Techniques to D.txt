Long-term doctor-patient stability is an important aspect to achieving continuity of each other which in turn promotes an increased understanding of the social context of the patient [6] and has been shown to be vital to patient satisfaction [7]. single homogenous group [8, 9]. The factors are typically treated as having a one-to-one linear relationship to the outcome doctor-patient relationship stability variable. duced by CART and SOFM and to evaluate these groups in terms of predicting doc-tor-patient stability. 
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the study design; research describes the key profiles and comparisons between SOFM and CART, while the con-clusions are made in Section 8. The data is obtained from a survey of rand omly selected general practices in the NSW into solo, 2, 3 to 4, and 5 and over, doctors. 100 consecutive patients are selected from the five practices of each of the five classes. In total, twenty of the sixty-one doctors placed on doctors and their patients, eight doctors who initially agreed withdrew from the study. Information about 1,122 patients and their respective doctors was collected. Data collection occurred between February and November 1999. 
The questionnaire is divided into three parts: the first were answered by the doctor, the second by the patients before consultation and the final part by the patients after consultation. The questionnaires obtained information about the health service envi-ronment, the doctor X  X  characteristics and perceptions about the patient, patient charac-variables are shown in Table 1 which indicates the average mean values of each ques-tionnaire variables and describes the abbreviation used. Doctor-patient stability variable is measured as modified continuity index (MCI). MCI is developed by Godkin and Rice and it indicates the frequency and intensity of the relationship by dividing the number of different doctors visited by the number of visits in a time period [11]. It is a continuous number between 0 and 1 and is the fre-quency visit to a dominant doctor over the number of visits in a year. Values close to 0 would indicate poor doctor-patient stability and 1, high doctor-patient stability. The research design contains the following stages: Stage 1: Application of CART and SOFM using the training data sets. 
At the first stage, about 20 per cent of patients were randomly allocated into evaluation set and the rest into training set. Both data mining techniques (CART and SOFM) were applied separately to group the general practice patients based on demo-package called Viscovery was used to model the data [12]. Stage 2: Validation of the CART and SOFM models using evaluation set (holdout sample). tion set. If the models were generalisable then the performance of the evaluation sets were analogous to the training period. To make the comparison, Mean absolute devia-tion (MAD) [13] and the coefficient of multiple determination (R 2 ) were used. Stage 3: An analysis and comparison of the results from supervised and unsupervised data mining techniques. SOFM generated 10 clusters (Stage 1) which were then renumbered in ascending or-der of MCI. There were three broad groups of clusters: those with MCI of 0.5 to 0.6, MCI of 0.6 to 0.76 and MCI over 0.76. When the clusters were created, the stability variable was left out as inputs. This was to see how well other variables were able to predict stability. have MCI between 0.5 to 0.58. 
There also seems to be a separation between two main groups of patients. Those those (Cluster 1-4) whose average stability is 0.58 and below (low stability). The fol-lowing describes those clusters: 
After the profiles of the stability clusters were examined, SOFM was used as a prediction tool. The MAD and R 2 in the training set were 0.1622 and 0.2 356 respectively. This section describes the results obtained from applying CART onto the training data which CART generated 7 terminal nodes. Figure 1 shows the CART tree diagram of stability when it was run on the training data set. Terminal node 1 has the lowest sta-bility, as measured by the MCI index, while Terminal node 7 has the highest. 
CART uses three patient variables: patient X  X  age, knowledge of the doctor and per-ception of their health. In general, patients whose average age is 46.5 and less tend to tend to have more stable doctor-patient relationships. In addition, younger and health-ier patients (represented in Terminal node 1) have a lower MCI score compared with younger but not-healthier patients (represented in Terminal node 4). 
Patients with a high level of knowledge of their doctor are correlated with high sta-represent ages between 46.5 to 64.5 and good self-perceived health. 
Like SOFM, there also seems to be a separation between two main groups of pa-(Cluster 1-4) whose stability is 0.69 and below. Age, health and knowledge of doctor variables can also be used to separate those 2 groups. Patients age 46.5 years and be-nodes were examined, CART was used as a prediction tool. The MAD and R 2 in the training set were at 0.1227 and 0.3591 respectively. A comparison was made between the training and evaluation data sets to establish the generalisability of both the SOFM and CART grouping models of patient stability. A significantly higher MAD and lower R 2 in the evaluation set, compared to the training set, would indicate poor applicability of the model. Table 3 shows the comparison be-tween MAD and R 2 of training and evaluation set of both SOFM and CART. Using MAD of the training and evaluation sets is statistically similar could not be rejected. The p-value was above 0.05 for both SOFM and CART. Both these measures provide evidence that the SOFM model of clusters and the doctor-patient stability. [14]. They list an example of a more serious morbidity group of patients that requires higher doctor-patient stability compared with the healthier groups. Thus, the interest-ing groups would be patients who have serious morbidity but for some reason choose not to have a usual general practitioner. These SOFM groupings are: Cluster 1: Young patients (average 31.5 years) with complex morbidity and poor are the least enabled and most dissatisfied with their consultations. They represent the tions with this group the most difficult. Cluster 4: Young patients (average 32.0 years) in social distress who are dissatisfied satisfaction. Although they consider themselves in good health, they are oblivious to their social distress and are unable to und erstand and communicate with their doctor. spend enough time with them. Cluster 6: Older patients (average 62.6 years) who have negative attitudes towards ho-listic health care with combinations of morbidity. They have problems communicat-abled by and were dissatisfied with their consultation. 
Those findings are to some extent consistent with CART which ranks age, self per-splitters. In addition, a comparison using Cohen Kappa[15] seems to show that SOFM and CART produced similar groupings. As mentioned earlier in Section 4 and 5, both CART and SOFM came up with two groupings of high and low stability groupings. An average of MCI 0.69 can be considered as a threshold for the broad groupings. below. Both SOM and CART are considered as the "raters" of the two categories based on high doctor-patient stability (above MCI 0.69) and low doctor-patient stabil-ity (MCI 0.69 and below). 
The total agreement between CART and SOFM is 726 compared with the agree-which seems to indicate that both SOFM and CART is similar to broadly group doctor-patient stability. If the groupings were due to chance, Cohen Kappa would be 0. This paper has discussed the use of CART and SOFM to classify patients accord-doing this, it reveals key variables and profiles that are associated with the stability outcome and highlight high risk groups. There were groupings of patients with combinations of morbidity who, for some reason, consider themselves to be in good health. They do not have a principal general practitioner who can provide continuous care for them. 
In addition, this research compares the performance of supervised and unsupervised key attributes which are age, self perception of health and social morbidity. less social mobility and with less availability of doctors. only twelve doctors that took part in the survey. A larger sample size of doctors and general practice would enable more association of their variables to patients. It is also final results because they did not participate in the survey when sampled. 
Future research might include open ended questions targeting dissatisfied patients may elicit the reasons underlying the poor communication, such as poor doctor train-ing, patient not being able to voice their opinion and doctors who felt rushed to com-plete as many consultations as possible.
