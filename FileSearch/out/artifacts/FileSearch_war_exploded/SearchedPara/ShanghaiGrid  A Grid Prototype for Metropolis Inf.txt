 ShanghaiGrid is a long-term project sponsored by Science and Technology Commis-sion of Shanghai Municipality with $6 million from the government and other partici-pants. It aims at constructing a metropolitan-area Information Services Grid (ISG) and establishing an open standard for widespread upper-layer applications from both communities and the government. Different from other Grid projects in China that are designed mainly for scientific usage, ShanghaiGrid focuses on information collections and services. 
Compared to the Computational Grid where provision of computational power, data access, and storage resources is the central task, the Shanghai Information Ser-vice Grid focuses on services to the people. ISG will provide information and services including: news, weather reports, traffic status, financial information, community security, ticket service, culture exchange, society education, video conferencing, and many digital government functions such as information sharing, documentation ser-vices, regulation and law enforcement, and so on. For example, an instant poll system is able to collect responses from citizens for an important decision; an emergency system can coordinate the rescue activity in a disaster event. 
The ongoing ShanghaiGrid project is application-driven. In the perspective of us-age, like the traditional web portal, ShanghaiGrid provides various information ser-vices such as traffic information service and weather information service which can be accessed by browsers, PDAs, or mobile phones. The potential services that ShanghaiGrid could provide are shown in Fig.1. Shanghai is a municipality of eastern China at the mouth of the Yangtze River. To-day, it has become the largest economic center and important port city in China, with a land area covering 6,340 square kilometers and a population of 16 million people. It is the entrepreneur city of 2010 Shanghai World Expo. The municipal government is working towards building Shanghai into a modern metropolis and into a world eco-nomic, financial, trading and shipping center by 2020. Information technology is a key approach to achieve these goals. Build ing the City Grid can improve the effi-ciency of government, build a platform for enterprise, provide citizens with various services, and can keep Shanghai at the t op of the world information technology as well. The municipal government has been always paying attention to the development and establishment of information industry and society. 
ShanghaiGrid project is one of five top grand Grid projects in China. It is based on the current four major computational aggregations and networks in Shanghai, i.e. the CHINANET (public internet backbone built by China Telecom), the SHERNET (Shanghai Education and Research Network), the STN (Shanghai Science &amp; Tech-nology Network), Shanghai Supercomputing Center (SSC), and various campus net-works in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (S JTU), Tongji University (TJU) and Shang-hai University (SHU), and is planned to enable the heterogeneous and distributed resources to collaborate into an information fountain and computational environment for Grid services, seamlessly and transparently. b u il d G r i d a pp licati o n s .

TIG Virtual Database Nodes (VDBN) provid es Virtual Database Services (VDBS) which supports uniform access to retrieve data from DPSs. The returned data are cached in cache server and will be automatic destroyed after a certain period of time defined by the Time To Live (TTL) property. 
TIG Computing Node (CN) performs the computing task. It is a grid node that pro-vides cluster computing services. Each CN contains a Cluster Resource Information Server (CRIS), a PC cluster (Linux Server), and a Supercomputer. For example, in the SCC Computing Node, the supercomputer is Drawing 3000, the PC cluster contains about 30 Linux PC Servers. The SJTU, FDU, SHU, TJU computing nodes have the similar configuration. The CN exposes itself through the CRIS. The CRIS not only provides the cluster resource information to TIG Information Service, but also man-ages the backend cluster systems which are us ed to run MPI application routines such as Computing Optimal Dynamic Path (CODP), demonstrating traffic road states, querying road or crossing information, for ecasting traffic flow and so on. CODP con-sumes most of the CPU time, it is the key problem of lowering the computing time. We use parallel computing technique to solve that problem in CN . 
TIG Information Server (IS) provides Information Service. All Grid nodes are reg-istered in IS. It provides the Information about the Grid resources. 
In CODP scenarios a user needs input the start and end points. The broker will send the request to the cache server first and check if there is any path in the cache match-ing the start and end point. If not, the broker will query the Information Service, ac-quire the suitable CN, start the Grid Service in the CN, and get result after the task is finished. The returned data are cached in cach e server. In order to provide users real time guidance there is a TTL property defined by the system. The data in cache server will be automatic deleted according to the value of TTL. ShanghaiGrid is an ongoing project aimed at constructing a metropolitan-area infor-mation service infrastructure. The Information Service Grid Toolkit can facilitate the development of the services and applications which include a set of middleware, high level services, design tools, package tools and etc. TIG is a typical domain Grid in ShanghaiGrid providing the traffic information and guidance to public using the com-puting power of the Grid. The Information Grid will push the information construc-tion of Shanghai and meet the requirement of its citizens.
