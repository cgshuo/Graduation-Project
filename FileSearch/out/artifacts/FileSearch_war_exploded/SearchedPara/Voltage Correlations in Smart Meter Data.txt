 The connectivity model of a power distribution network can easily become outdated due to system changes occurring in the field. Maintaining and sustaining an accurate connectiv-ity model is a key challenge for distribution utilities world-wide. This work shows that voltage time series measure-ments collected from customer smart meters exhibit corre-lations that are consistent with the hierarchical structure of the distribution network. These correlations may be lever-aged to cluster customers based on common ancestry and help verify and correct an existing connectivity model. Ad-ditionally, customers may be clustered in combination with voltage data from circuit metering points, spatial data from the geographical information system, and any existing but partially accurate connectivity model to infer customer to transformer and phase connectivity relationships with high accuracy. We report analysis and validation results based on data collected from multiple feeders of a large electric distribution network in North America. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large scale measurement study of customer voltage data and its use in inferring network connectivity information.
 I.5.3 [ Pattern Recognition ]: Clustering X  Algorithms ; J.m [ Computer Applications ]: Miscellaneous Algorithms, Design, Measurement, Experimentation Power Distribution Grids; Voltage Time Series; Topology Inference; Data Mining; Clustering The connectivity model ( cm ) of the physical distribution network specifies how the devices, assets, and customers are interconnected downstream of a distribution substation. For example, which customer is powered by which distribu-tion transformer, which customer is powered by which phase of the feeder, and so on. cm essentially provides a coarse-grained view of the network topology. A common problem faced by distribution utilities worldwide is an inaccurate or unknown cm of their network when compared to the actual connectivity that exists on the field. The cm may not al-ways be updated or tracked based on changes made by field crews and its accuracy deteriorates over time due to mainte-nance, repairs, and restoration activities following faults or outages. Moreover during large scale outages, there is often a trade-off between expediting restoration versus tracking changes to the distribution network.

While cm is foundational to planning, operations, and maintenance of distribution networks, the key factors driv-ing utilities to improve its accuracy are effectively faster restoration and the ability to accurately communicate with impacted customers during outages. The annual cost of power interruptions in US is estimated to be $ 79 B with 106  X  54 outage minutes per customer. Interruptions in elec-tric service occur from time to time due to a number of rea-sons including storms, aging assets, excess loading from heat waves, and other system disturbances. Any analysis follow-ing a fault in the distribution system uses the cm to identify the root causes and determine the appropriate course of ac-tion. An accurate cm minimizes the diagnostic time and the time spent by crew in the field, leading to reduced outage minutes and improved system availability.

During outages, utilities seek to inform customers about the status of restoration and the expected downtimes. The cm is required to localise customers downstream of a faulted device and to map each fault with the right set of out-aged customers for communication. An inaccurate cm in-creases the risk of erroneous communication and limits a utility X  X  ability to provide customized and timely informa-tion to their customers, which may negatively impact cus-tomer relations. Additionally, an accurate cm is required to localise losses, estimate loading at unmetered points such as distribution transformers, and ensure a balanced infusion of energy back into the distribution grid when customers have behind-the-meter resources such as distributed generation and storage/electric vehicles [4, 6, 9, 10].

Existing techniques to maintain an accurate cm include the use of manual field inspections and power line com-munications (PLC). Manual inspections are expensive and unsustainable as field configurations change over time and therefore these need to be repeated periodically. The PLC approach requires both customer and grid meters to be able to read and write signals onto the power-line and is capital intensive. Additionally, challenges arise as signals may not propagate over long distances or across assets.

Leading utilities are undertaking initiatives to modernize their information management and data analytics capabil-ities in order to realize the benefits of smart grid deploy-ments. This work focuses on the use of data already avail-able from a distribution network to infer its connectivity model. Our approach to infer connectivity relies on cluster-ing customers using their voltage data. The computed cus-tomer clusters may be used to identify inconsistencies in the existing cm or correct an existing cm that may be partially accurate. We observe that voltage time series measurements from customer smart meters exhibit hierarchical correlations which may be exploited to partition customers based on common phase 1 , distribution transformer, and feeder. Cus-tomers may also be clustered in combination with voltage data from circuit metering points ( scada ) and spatial data from the GIS to verify and correct errors in customer to transformer and phase mapping, which are generally prone to inaccuracies. We report validation results based on the analysis of data collected from multiple feeders of a large distribution network in North America. The data includes average rms values of voltage recorded once every 5 min-utes from more than 10 K customers across 5 feeders and 2 substations for about 2 months. The performance of tech-niques is estimated by comparing the computed connectivity relationships with the ground truth available from existing database and results from field verification. We view the main contributions of this work as follows: 1. Using smart meter measurements, we show that cus-2. We compare different approaches to infer customer to 3.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the topology of the distribution network and the connectivity model. Section 3 summarizes the voltage and spatial data used in this work and our observations on var-ious correlations, while Section 4 describes our clustering methodology. Section 5 presents our analysis of the hier-archical correlations. Sections 6 and 7 describe our tech-niques and results for inferring customer to transformer and phase connectivity using clustering. Section 8 presents re-lated work and Section 9 concludes. Figure 1: Simplified view of a distribution network and the mapping between customers and assets Distribution System. The power delivery infrastructure consists of generation, transmission, and distribution sys-tems. Electric power is generated in large power plants as 3-phase ac voltage and reaches distribution via a transmission system. The distribution system starts from the distribution substation and consists of primary and secondary networks. The primary network consists of 3-phase feeders which carry power at medium voltage from the substation transformers ( trf s) to the distribution transformers ( dt s). Each may power multiple feeders. Depending on the type and density of customers, a feeder may carry power at different voltages such as 33 kV, 13.2 kV, and 4.8 kV and serve a few hundred distribution transformers. The branches or line seg-ments of a feeder are also known as laterals . The secondary network carries power from the distribution transformers to the customers at low voltage (e.g. 120 V).
Substation transformer circuit fed (Miles) transformers customers data
A 3 -phase feeder consists of three transmission lines, usu-ally labelled as A , B and C , which carry ac power with their voltage waveforms shifted by 120 o . A dt receives power by tapping onto one of the 3 phases of a feeder and is generally single-phase ( 1 -phase). On average a dt might serve about 8 single-phase residential customers. A few dt s that serve larger loads such as super-markets or office buildings may be 2 or 3 -phase. Similarly a feeder branch or lateral may be single, two, or three-phase. [10].
 Connectivity Model. The cm of a distribution network specifies the mapping between various assets and customers downstream of a substation. In particular, which customer is powered by which dt , which dt is powered by which feeder and phase, which feeder is powered by which trf , and so on. For example, the cm of the distribution system in Fig. 1 records that customers C1,C2 are powered by distribution transformer DT1 , while C3,C4 are powered by DT2 . DT1 is powered by phase A of feeder F1 , while DT2 is powered by phase C of F1 . Feeder F1 in turn is powered by TRF1 . In the above example, since the distribution transformers are single-phase, customer phase is same as transformer phase. The cm may also record other hierarchical relationships such as the mapping between a lateral and the set of transformers that it powers.
 Errors . The most common errors in the cm are related to the mapping between customers, dt s, and phases of the feeder. For example, the phase of a customer or its distri-bution transformer may be recorded incorrectly or missing. Similarly the dt that powers a customer may have been in-accurately recorded. Other types of errors include the map-ping of customers to feeders wherein some of the customers under a feeder are recorded as being powered by another feeder. We study these mappings in subsequent sections. Power measurements in a distribution network are gener-ally available from customer smart meters and on-grid sen-sors. The primary network is monitored using a scada (su-pervisory control and data acquisition) system that records feeder level measurements (per-phase voltage, current, ac-tive and reactive power, etc.) close to the substation. cus-tomer smart meters generally record periodic measurements of load (kWh) and voltage ( rms value) over small time in-tervals of 5 -30 min as setup by the utility.

In this work we use measurements from five anonymized feeder circuits belonging to two substations of a North Amer-ican distribution network. The mapping between substa-tions, trf s and feeders is showing in Table 1. Each circuit is fed at 13.2 kV and serves more than 2K residential, com-mercial and industrial customers.
 Low-voltage data from smart meters. We analyze two months of voltage measurements from customers which are powered by single-phase distribution transformers. The measurements have average rms values of voltage in the 120 V range. These are recorded once every 5 minutes up to a precision of one decimal place. The measurements also have missing values.
 Medium-voltage data from the SCADA system. The feeder circuits are instrumented with scada field devices which monitor the feeders close to the substation trans-former and periodically report per-phase measurements of voltage, current, and power. We consider two months of voltage measurements from these devices. The measure-ments are averaged over 5 minute intervals and normalized to 120 V range to compare them against the low-voltage data dfrom the customers.
 Spatial Data from GIS. Anonymized geospatial loca-tions of customers and dt s are available and used to sub-cluster customers and transformers under a feeder based on geographical proximity. This is utilized in the inference of customer to dt mapping.
 Customer to DT mapping (Ground Truth). The ex-isting cm holds the mapping between customers and the dt s. While this mapping is known to have good accuracy for the 5 chosen circuits, it may not be 100 % accurate. We use this mapping to estimate the performance of clustering algorithms.
 Customer to phase mapping (Ground Truth). The transformer phase is available for all 1 -phase distribution transformers (customer phase is same as transformer phase for 1 -phase transformers). The phase of overhead (pole top) transformers is available before and after manual field in-spections. In case of overhead distribution, field inspections are conducted by linemen using a combination of visual in-spections and specialized devices. The devices are reserved to check the phase at certain operating points in the feeder while walking down the line segments and visually inspect-ing the phase down to individual transformers or customers. The voltage data analyzed in this work was collected be-fore commencing field inspections. The phasing information available during data collection and after field inspections is used to validate algorithms and also identify errors in exist-ing phasing information.
 DT to lateral mapping. Accurate mapping from distri-bution transformers to laterals, i.e. the set of customers powered by each branch of the feeder, is available in the ex-isting cm for each of the circuits. This mapping is used to introduce spatial constraints in the inference of customer to dt mapping. Fig. 2 shows benchmark plots that give an overview of the voltage measurements obtained from customer smart me-ters and the scada system. Fig. 2 (left) plots the voltage measurements of 3 random customers on different phases
Our approach to infer connectivity leverages the fact that the voltage variations observed by customers powered by the same dt , phase, or feeder tend to be more  X  X imilar X . How-ever, there are different measures of similarity and different approaches to compare voltage measurements. In particular, we have studied 3 distance metrics and 3 data transforma-tions which are described below. Let v i,t denote the raw rms voltage measurements from cus-tomer i in the t th time step, t  X  { 1,...,m } . We compute the continuous voltage fluctuations as  X  i,t = v i,t  X  v i,t  X  1 also discretize these to obtain binary fluctuations, which we denote by b i,t . Let V i = [ v i,t ] m  X  1 denote the m -dimensional observation vector that holds the time series of voltage mea-surements obtained from customer i . Similarly, let  X  i and B i denote the delta and binary observation vectors respec-tively. We assume that voltage measurements are approxi-mately synchronised across customers, which is the case for our datasets as well.

Thus for each customer i , we have three datasets: (i) Raw : original data V i , (ii) Delta : continuous fluctuations  X  (iii) Binary : discretized fluctuations B i . In order to iden-tify which among the three forms of data is best suited for clustering, we consider the most common problem of par-titioning customers of a feeder into 3 groups corresponding to the three phases A , B and C . We apply the k-means algorithm [11] for each dataset with three measures of sim-ilarity: (i) L 2 (Euclidean) (ii) Cosine, and (iii) Correlation. To compare the resultant clusters with the true customer to phase mapping, we utilize the labelling procedure described next. To determine clustering accuracy, we assign labels to the computed clusters using an existing customer to phase map-ping as follows. The computed clusters are intersected with the clusters corresponding to the existing customer to phase mapping and a one to one correspondence is established based on maximum match. Each cluster in the computed solution is assigned the phase of its matching cluster in the existing solution (Fig. 5). The accuracy of the clustering so-lution is then calculated as the proportion of the customers that were assigned the correct labels. Note that the same procedure may be used to calculate the clustering accuracy for experiments which determine customer to dt or feeder mapping (where the labels correspond feeders or dt s rather than phase). Additionally, the same procedure can also be used to correct an existing customer to phase or dt mapping that may be partially accurate, under the assumption that the accuracy of the existing mapping is not too low.
Fig. 6 shows the accuracy of phase clustering for the three datasets and three similarity measures for a sample feeder. We see that irrespective of the similarity measure, Binary performs best. Moreover, the performance of the three sim-ilarity measures with Binary are comparable to each other. Similar results are observed for other mapping experiments as well (customer X  dt &amp; customer X  X eeder). Fig. 7 shows the cluster scatter plots for two phases A and B , which com-pare the computed clusters with the ground truth. In each case, correlation is used as a measure of similarity. Again Figure 5: Labelling clusters in the computed solu-tion using labels of an existing solution Figure 6: Clustering accuracy for the combination of datasets and similarity measures. the plots show higher accuracy for Binary when compared to Raw or Delta .

In what follows in the rest of the paper, we apply k-means algorithm for clustering over the binary observation vectors using correlation as a measure of similarity. Apart from means being one of the standard techniques, it is especially suitable for our settings because, in all cases, we know the value of k beforehand. This is because we seek clustering to derive the connectivity of customers to feeder, phases or dt s and these remain unchanged despite any changes in the connectivity. For labelling the resultant clusters and calcu-lating the clustering accuracy, we follow the same procedure as detailed above. For the experiments, we break up the datasets into batches of size 4 days and conduct clustering over the different batches, presenting the average accuracy in the results. Experiments over other batch-sizes of 1  X  7 days also gave similar results. This section describes our analysis towards partitioning cus-tomers belonging to different feeders. We consider three possible settings: (i) Inter-substation: Feeders powered by different substations, (ii) Inter-TRF: Feeders powered by different trf s of same substation, and (iii) Intra-TRF: Feeders powered by same trf .

For each of these settings, we combine customers belong-ing to the two feeders (based on the actual ground truth) and then apply voltage-data clustering (using k-means ) to separate them into their respective feeders. Furthermore in each case, we selectively combine all customers belonging to the same single phase (A, B or C), same two phases (AB, BC or AC) and all three phases (ABC) across the two feed-TRF ers. These experiments allow us to determine settings under which feeder correlations are stronger versus phase correla-tions. For example, if customers of phases A and B of two feeders (denoted by a 1 ,b 1 ,a 2 ,b 2 ) are combined and parti-tioned into 2 clusters, then these may separate as { a b 2 } or { a 1 a 2 ,b 1 b 2 } (or other combinations) depending on whether customers are strongly correlated based on phase or feeders.

Feeder-wise separation. Fig. 8 shows the accuracy of feeder separation for Inter-substation , Inter-trf , and Intra-trf . The plots show average accuracy and standard deviation over multiple batches of voltage data. We see that for both the Inter-substation and Inter-trf setting, the accuracy of separation is almost 1 , for all the phase combi-nations. This implies that for both these settings, voltage correlations between customers belonging to the same feeder are not only strong, but also much higher than any phase correlations. However, we see that for Intra-trf , where we consider feeders powered by the same trf , the accuracy is much lower. In particular, for cases where two or all three phases are considered together, accuracy drops to 0.6 . This occurs because the phase-wise correlations are quite strong among customers belonging to the same TRF, even if they belong to different feeders. Thus, the two obtained clusters do not particularly correspond to the two feeders.

The above results show that as long as customers are not powered by the same trf , they can easily be separated out into multiple feeders using their voltage data. For instance, given customers powered by s different substations, we can partition these into s groups, one corresponding to each sub-station, simply by using their voltage measurements.
Phase-wise separation. For this, we conducted the same set of experiments as above, for the three settings, with the aim of obtaining clusters of customers belonging to the same phase. Fig. 9 shows the accuracy of customers being partitioned based on same phase. We observe that the accuracy is low for both Inter-substation and Inter-trf settings. This is expected because, as seen earlier, feeder-wise correlations are much stronger in these cases. However, for Intra-trf setting, the accuracy achieved is closer to 1 . This goes to show that customers powered by the same trf are related to each other much more on the basis of their phase rather than their feeder.

In summary, using voltage-data to separate customers be-longing to different feeders is accurate when the feeders are powered by different trf s. When customers belong to the same trf , they can be accurately separated based on differ-ent phases. These results match the underlying structure of the distribution network as feeders under the same trf are essentially powered by the same 3 phases of the trf . During maintenance and repair operations, the field crew may switch customers between nearby dt s in order to restore power to the customers. Over time, such changes result in an inaccurate customer to dt mapping. In this section, we present techniques to infer customer to dt mapping solely on the basis of the data available with the utilities: GIS data, voltage time-series data, and any existing but partially accurate customer to dt mapping. We present results for 3 feeders:  X  ,  X  1 and  X  2 . Similar results are obtained for other feeders as well. Utilities often possess GIS data of their network which in-cludes the geospatial locations of customers and dt s. Our approach to infer customer to dt mapping leverages the GIS data to divide customers and dt s under a feeder into smaller groups within which voltage-data clustering is applied.
Now, to cluster spatial data, we require a method that is capable of discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes (corre-sponding to streets or blocks) without much prior informa-tion. DBSCAN [8] is a well established clustering method for such purposes. DBSCAN requires two parameters  X  MinPts and Eps , which determine the sizes and number of clus-ters respectively. A typical value of MinPts is 4 (our re-sults do not vary with change in MinPts). On the other hand, Eps, denoting the neighbourhood distance of a point, plays a significant role in clustering. As our end goal is to obtain customer X  dt connectivity, we used that as the fac-tor for varying Eps. Specifically, avg denotes the average customer X  dt distance in a feeder (as per the database); and Eps is varied from 0.5  X  avg to 2  X  avg for DBSCAN runs.
Fig. 10 shows the resulting spatial clusters (colour-coded) for one of the circuits,  X  2 for three values of Eps. We see that for low value of Eps ( 0.5  X  avg ), a large number of clus-ters are obtained, most so small so as to correspond to a single street (or even less), while for higher values of Eps, we obtain well demarcated large neighbourhoods. As the purpose of clustering is to help determine customer X  dt map-ping, we define the accuracy of clustering as the fraction of customers that were clustered into the same cluster as their dt s. Fig. 11 (left) shows the accuracy values for the three feeders over increasing Eps values. As expected, with in-creasing Eps, as the cluster sizes increase, the accuracy also increases because larger clusters are more likely to contain the customers and their dt s together (tending to 1 for the full feeder scenario). Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that high accuracy (above 0.9 ) is achieved for Eps= avg case with only marginal improvement further on.

However, the accuracy measure by itself is not a complete indicator of the effectiveness of clustering. For the purpose of identifying customer X  dt connectivity, it is preferable to Figure 11: Spatial clustering X  (left): clustering ac-curacy, and (right): number of clusters have smaller spatial clusters (as long as they are accurate) so that there are fewer candidate dt s for each customer. Fig. 11(right) depicts the number of clusters generated for the three feeders for increasing Eps value. We see that while the number of clusters range from 50 to 150 (for  X  Eps= 0.5  X  avg , they fall rapidly to range between 10 X 20 for the Eps= avg case. Since the accuracy achieved by Eps= avg case is also high, it appears to be a good parameter for generating the right set of clusters. In order to infer the customer X  dt connectivity, we apply means clustering over the voltage data of the customers, as described in Section. 4, with number of clusters k = number of dt s. The aim is to obtain distinct clusters, each cor-responding to one dt and containing only the set of those customers connected to that dt .

Given the set of customers belonging to a feeder, one may apply voltage-data clustering over them directly. However, spatial clustering of customers and dt s provides smaller clusters within each feeder. With the assumption that a customer is likely to be connected to a dt in its vicinity than to one faraway, it may be beneficial to conduct voltage-based clustering of customers within each spatial cluster sep-arately. The final case is to consider the lateral to dt ping. Although the lateral connectivity may not always be available, it provides good groupings of customers and dt within each branch of the feeder. Group of customers and number of dt s belonging to a lateral are relatively small in size, however, all the customers in that group are only connected to dt s belonging to that group. Thus, lateral information provides small yet accurate spatial groups over which voltage-based clustering can be performed to obtain customer X  dt connectivity.

In summary, we conducted voltage data-based clustering for all the above cases  X  (i) within spatial clusters (formed Figure 12: Customer-DT clustering: Accuracy of voltage clustering over spatial clusters formed with different Eps/avg ratios, full feeder and lateral cases. Figure 13: Customer-DT clustering: Accuracy over existing connectivity with different inaccuracies with Eps ranging from 0.5  X  avg to 2  X  avg ), (ii) within the full feeder and, (iii) within each lateral. For each case, while using k-means , k was set to the number of dt s in that group. Therefore, in the  X  X eeder X  and  X  X ateral X  case, it was equal to the number of dt s belonging to the feeder or the lateral respectively. However, for clustering within each spa-tial cluster, k value was set to the number of dt s present in that cluster. After the clusters are obtained, dt s are as-signed to the clusters based on majority rule using ground truth to determine the accuracy of clustering, as explained in Section. 4.2.
 As expected, when using spatial clusters generated with Eps= 0.5  X  avg and Eps= 0.75  X  avg , the accuracy values are low, since the accuracy of the spatial clusters themselves are low (ref Fig. 11). For Eps= avg and higher, good accuracy is achieved, ranging from 0.78 for  X  1 feeder to 0.87 for  X  feeder. For the feeder case, similar accuracy is achieved, though on average, slightly lower than when compared to the cases of Eps= avg to 1.5  X  avg . Finally, the accuracy when clustering within each lateral is even higher at around 0.9 . This is expected as the lateral case represents the best-case scenario. However, lateral information may not always be available.

The previous plots show the accuracy of clustering when compared to ground truth. In practice, our goal is to cor-rect an existing customer-dt mapping that may be partially accurate. To simulate this case, we repeat the above ex-periments by randomly introducing errors (20-40%) in the existing customer to dt mapping (thus leading to 80%-60% accurate ground truth scenarios). Fig. 13 plots the accuracy for full feeder case, when an existing but partially accurate mapping is used in the labeling of computed voltage-data clusters, as described in section 4.2. We observe that as long as the errors are not too high, the accuracy of the existing mapping can be improved.

In summary, the results show that by performing clus-tering over the voltage data and then assigning dt s to the clusters, 0.8 -0.9 accuracy can be achieved depending on the setting. Moreover, we can see that when lateral-level infor-mation is not available, spatial clustering prior to voltage-clustering can lead to slightly better results on average. This section considers the problem of inferring customer to phase mapping, which is generally prone to more inaccura-cies when compared to other mappings. As before we use voltage-data clustering to infer the phase of customers. In order to partition customers based on phases, we cluster them into three groups, i.e. no. of clusters k = 3 in means , one corresponding to each phase A , B , and C . In this case, we compare our results with both the existing map-ping available in the database as well as the true mapping that was obtained after conducting manual field inspections for the 3 feeder circuits:  X  ,  X  1 and  X  2 .

In order to assign a phase to each cluster, we utilize the per-phase feeder measurements obtained from the scada system. Let f A,t denote the rms voltage measurement from phase A of the feeder during time step t  X  { 1,...,m } and let F A = [ f A,t ] m  X  1 . Similarly let F B and F C correspond to phases B and C respectively. We pass feeder measure-ments { F A , F B , F C } as centroids of the initial solution to the k-means algorithm. Thus each centroid effectively has a phase. The algorithm iteratively updates the centroids and yields the final set of customer clusters. Each clus-ter is assigned the phase of its centroid. Note that even when data from scada system is not available, clustering can still be used to verify if two customers belong to the same phase. Therefore it can identify inconsistencies in the existing customer X  X hase mapping solely from customer volt-age measurements.

As described earlier, we divide the voltage dataset, which covers 2 months, into multiple batches of 4 days each. Thus we may compute a customer to phase mapping for each batch and combine these clustering solutions to obtain the final clusters corresponding to the full dataset. We present results using two different techniques of combining these clustering solutions. (i) Majority Approach, and (ii) Cluster Ensemble.
 Majority-rule approach: Each customer may be assigned a different phase based on each batch of voltage data. This simple approach assigns a final phase to a customer based on the majority of all assignments it receives over different batches.
 Cluster Ensemble: There exist several cluster ensemble techniques to combine multiple partitionings of data with-out accessing the original feature values. Specifically, we use Cluster-based Similarity Partitioning Algorithm (CSPA) [13] along with k -medoid clustering algorithm to ensemble indi-vidual partitionings into a single clustering. We first gener-ate a similarity matrix based on the individual partitionings corresponding to each batch and then apply the k -medoid algorithm to produce the final clustering. CSPA is an intu-itive and efficient cluster ensemble algorithm and suits our purpose effectively.

We compare both these above methods with the accuracy averaged multiple batches in Fig. 14. We see that for all the feeders, the performance of Cluster Ensemble and Ma-jority Rule are comparable to each other and yield close to Figure 14: Customer X  X hase mapping: Accuracy af-ter applying cluster integration techniques 90 % accuracy. Moreover both these methods perform sig-nificantly better than the batch-average. We obtain similar results when we use different batch sizes of 1  X  7 days. Thus combining clustering solutions obtained from the different batches of voltage-data generates a final set of clusters with improved accuracy. Particularly for customer X  X hase mapping, we possess two mapping solutions. We possess a Database solution which refers to the mapping stored in the utility X  X  database and not verified in the field. In addition, we possess the actual Ground truth , which was obtained after the phase of was inspected in the field for the 3 feeders. Since the dt considered are all single-phase, the customers connected to a dt have the same phase as their dt s.

We now compare our clustering-based mapping solution with manual field inspections to determine its effectiveness in identifying and correcting errors in the existing database solution. For this, we use the computed customer X  X hase mapping and assign a phase to each dt based on the phases of all customers under it. We then compare transformer phases across the computed solution, database solution, and the ground truth. Table 2 presents the results. The sec-ond column lists the total number of single-phase dt s which were verified in the field and the last column shows the ac-curacy of the existing database solution (as compared with ground truth from field inspections). The positive and nega-tive columns count dt s wherein the computed phase is same as ground truth. The positive column counts dt s whose phase remains unchanged after field inspections. The neg-ative column counts dt s whose phase was erroneous in the database, but was identified and corrected in the computed solution. The false positive counts the dt s which had an erroneous phase in the database solution but were not cor-rected in the computed solution. The false negatives counts dt s which had a correct phase in the database solution, but were identified as incorrect by the computed solution. In summary, the results show that our method of identifying customer X  X hase based on voltage-data clustering helped im-prove the accuracy of the database solution significantly in case of  X  1 and  X  2 . For feeder  X  , there is a negligible drop in the accuracy. As explained above, phase is assigned to dt based on the computed phases of its customers. However, this customer X  dt mapping was not verified on the field and can contain errors. These errors possibly lead to the slight drop in accuracy of the  X  feeder. While field inspections can be used to obtain 100 % accuracy, they are expensive and time-consuming. These results show that our analytics approach is a low-cost alternative, which may be used to improve the accuracy of the database solution. We know of no prior work that infers customer to feeder or transformer mapping using data already available in the distribution network. This section summarizes prior work on inferring customer phase. Caird [5] discloses a system and method for phase identification with suitably enhanced meters that can detect phases based upon a unique signal injected into the phase line. The disadvantage of signal in-jection methods or in general those that rely on power-line communication ( plc ) is that they require enhanced hard-ware to transmit and receive signals at different points of the grid, increasing capital and maintenance costs. More-over in North America, feeders from substations can run for several miles before reaching a customer. Therefore based solutions become impractical and expensive since the signal may not propagate over long distances or across dt without repeaters. Our approach on the other hand simply relies on voltage measurements from customers and feeders and therefore does not require any additional hardware other than conventional meters.

Our prior work [1] describes an optimization approach to infer the connectivity model using a time series of customer and grid side load (kWh) measurements. The measurements are used to set up a system of linear equations based upon the principle of conservation of energy. The equations are analyzed to fit a customer to phase mapping that is con-sistent with the observed time series (i.e. it minimizes the error of fit). Dilek X  X  [7] work on phase prediction in power circuits also uses interval consumption measurements, how-ever the author employs a heuristic Tabu search to deter-mine the phase of attached loads. Voltage-based techniques have two advantages over load-based techniques. Firstly, voltage-based clustering techniques may be used to verify and correct an existing customer to phase mapping solely from customer meter measurements. The load-based opti-mization approaches require both customer and feeder mea-surements. Secondly, since load-based optimization tech-niques are based on the principle of conservation, their ac-curacy may reduce in the presence of any non-AMI or un-metered loads. The voltage-based approaches however are insensitive to unmetered loads in the system.

In [12], authors analyse measurements from a low volt-age network consisting of a 3 -phase distribution transformer and its customers. Voltage measurements of individual cus-tomers are matched with the per-phase measurements taken at the transformer to determine customer phase. Our prior work [2, 3] studies voltage measurements from a microgrid and a feeder circuit respectively to infer phase relationship. We demonstrate that individually comparing the low volt-age measurements from customers with the feeder measure-ments yields a lower accuracy when compared to cluster-ing, which simultaneously compares customer measurements with each other as well as with the per-phase feeder mea-surements. This current work, on the other hand, studies voltage data from multiple feeder circuits of a distribution network and reports accuracy results based on manual field inspections. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the clus-tering in comparison to field inspections for identifying and correcting phase errors. Furthermore we show that voltage measurements exhibit hierarchical correlations which can be exploited to infer customer to feeder and transformer map-ping in addition to customer phase. An accurate connectivity model is required in the planning, operations, and maintenance of distribution networks. It en-ables faster restoration, accurate and timely communication with customers during outages, and is also needed to effi-ciently integrate distributed generation sources. Automated inference of customer to distribution transformer and phase mapping using data that is already available from smart meters, feeder sensors, and GIS data allows utilities to pe-riodically validate their connectivity and maintain a more accurate connectivity model of their distribution network without the use of expensive manual inspections.

In this work, we show that customer voltage measure-ments exhibit hierarchical correlations which are consistent with the hierarchical connectivity relationships that exist between customers, distribution transformers, phases, and feeders of a distribution network. We show that voltage-data clustering may be used to partition customers under different feeders as long as they are powered by different sub-station transformers. We present a novel analytics approach that can infer both customer-to-transformer and phase map-ping with the help of customer voltage measurements in combination with feeder measurements, GIS data and any existing but partially accurate customer to transformer map-ping. We showed accuracy results based on analysis of low and medium voltage measurements collected from multiple feeder circuits with more than 10 K single-phase customers. Our results indicate that voltage measurements spanning several days could be utilized to infer both customer to transformer and phase mapping with high accuracy.

Future work will evaluate other clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering and study their performance using different cluster validity measures. We will study the use of spatio-temporal techniques which may be used to effectively combine voltage and GIS data. We will study the impact of distributed generation on customer voltage measurements and also develop approaches that combine both load (kWh) and voltage measurements to infer customer phase. [1] V.
