LNCS Sublibrary: SL 7  X  Artificial Intelligence PAKDD 2014 was the 18th conference of the Pacific Asia Conference series on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The conference was held in Tainan, Taiwan, during May 13 X 16, 2014. Since its inception in 1997, the PAKDD con-ference series has been a leading international conference in the areas of data mining and knowledge discovery. It provides an inviting and inspiring forum for researchers and practitioners, from both academia and industry, to share new ideas, original research results, and practical experience. The 18th edition con-tinues the great tradition with three world-class keynote speeches, a wonderful technical program, a handful of high quality tutorials and workshops, and a data mining competition.
 gram, involving more than 980 authors in total. Each submitted paper underwent a rigorous double-blind review process and was reviewed by at least three Pro-gram Committee (PC) members as well as one senior PC member. Based on the extensive and thorough discussions b y the reviewers, the senior PC members made recommendations. The Program Co-chairs went through each of the senior PC members X  recommendations, as well as the submitted papers and reviews, to come up with the final selection. Ov erall, 100 papers were accepted in the technical program among 371 submissi ons, yielding a 27% acceptance rate. 40 of which (10.8%) had full presentations and 60 of which (16.2%) had short pre-sentations. The technical program consisted of 21 sessions, covering the general fields of data mining and KDD extensively. We thank all reviewers (Senior PC, PC and external invitees) for their gre at efforts in reviewing the papers in a timely fashion. Without their hard work, we would not have been able to see such a high-quality program.
