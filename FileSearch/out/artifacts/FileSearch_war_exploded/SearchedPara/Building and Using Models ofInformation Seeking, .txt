 Understanding how people interact with information sys-tems when searching is central to the study of Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR). While much of the prior work in this area has either been conceptual, observational or em-pirical, recently there has been renewed interest in develop-ing mathematical models of information seeking and search. This is because such models can provide a concise and com-pact representation of search behaviours and naturally gen-erate testable hypotheses about search behaviour.
This full day tutorial focuses on explaining and building formal models of Information Seeking and Retrieval. The tutorial is structured into four sessions. In the first ses-sion we will discuss the rationale of modelling and examine a number of early formal models of search (including early cost models and the Probability Ranking Principle). Then we will examine more contemporary formal models (includ-ing Information Foraging Theory, the Interactive Probability Ranking Principle, and Search Economic Theory). The fo-cus will be on the insights and intuitions that we can glean from the math behind these models. The latter sessions will be dedicated to building models that optimise particular ob-jectives which drive how users make decisions, along with a how-to guide on model building, where we will describe dif-ferent techniques (including analytical, graphical and com-putational) that can be used to generate hypotheses from such models. In the final session, participants will be chal-lenged to develop a simple model of interaction applying the techniques learnt during the day, before concluding with an overview of challenges and future directions.

This tutorial is aimed at participants wanting to know more about the various formal models of information seek-ing, search and retrieval, that have been proposed in the literature. The tutorial will be presented at an introductory level, and is designed to support participants who want to be able to understand and apply such models, as well as to build their own models.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval:Search Process; H.5.m [ Information Interfaces and Presentation ]:Miscellaneous Theory, Experimentation, Economics, Human Factors Search Behaviour; User Models; Retrieval Strategies; Eval-uation The tutorial will be structured in four main parts: (1) Why Model and Early Models (1960-1980) (2) Contempo-rary Models (1980+), (3) Model building, and, (4) Making a model (as an hands-on activity for the participants). The day will conclude with a discussion of challenges and future directions. It should be noted that in the field of Informa-tion Retrieval we have developed lots of models -mainly re-trieval models. However, this tutorial will focus on building models for interactive information seeking and retrieval, and so focus on modelling the user X  X  interactions with the inter-face/system in order to characterise search behaviours. Such models are rarer, as they tend to be more complicated, and require a greater appreciation of how people interact with systems. Indeed, developing such models has been hailed as a (somewhat) grand challenge for Interactive Informa-tion Retrieval [15]. Furthermore, such models are becoming increasingly important as they form the basis of many per-formance measures, provide a better understanding of how people interact with such systems, and a way to evaluate the utility of various features/interactions.
In this part of the tutorial, we will develop the motiva-tion and rationale for developing formal (by which we mean mathematical) models of Information Seeking and Retrieval (ISR). To begin, we will discuss and describe various concep-tual and descriptive models of ISR, including Bates X  Berry Picking Model [13] and the ISR framework proposed by Ing-wersen and J  X  arvelin [27], along with other such models (e.g. [14, 16, 17, 29, 28, 30, 23, 46]). This will provide the back-ground for the tutorial where we point out the limitations of such models and motivate the need to develop models that are not only descriptive in nature, but predictive and cru-cially explanatory. To set the context, we will discuss the qualities of information, the poverty of attention, informa-tion as a good, and how information can be valued. This is important because information seeking is intrinsically em-bedded within a task. Once motivations and context are provided, we will then examine a number of early formal models (1960-1980s) that have been developed using De-cision Theory, Economics and Cost-Benefit frameworks [1, 36, 22, 35]; the most notable being the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP) [35]. The following topics will be covered: 1. Types of Models (Conceptual, Descriptive, Formal) 2. An overview of Conceptual models 3. What is a model? Why formal, why mathematical? 4. Why formally model ISR? Why we need theory? At 5. The benefits and costs of formally modelling ISR 6. Why don X  X  we have lots of formal models for ISR? 7. A discussion on the lack, and lack of usage, of formal 8. The Information Age, Poverty of Attention, Mathlus X  9. Information as Good and the Value of Information [44] 10. Decision Making and Optimization Models [26, 31] 11. Optimality and Rationality [40, 39, 42] 12. Cooper X  X  Model of Searching [22] 13. Probability Ranking Principle [35]
The second part of the tutorial will focus on three con-temporary formal models. First we shall show how the PRP can be extended to consider interaction by presenting the In-teractive Probability Ranking Principle [25]. Next, we shall delve into Information Foraging Theory (IFT), which has become very popular and is often used to motivate experi-ments, but yet infrequently used in terms of modelling and prediction. Here, we will focus on the patch model, and explain the different implications of the model/theory, and how user behaviour is expected to change under varying cir-cumstances. We will explain how these implications can be generated through a graphical analysis (and for the more math savvy, how they can be analytically derived). Then, we will turn our attention to the initial model of Search Economic Theory (SET) [3] and explain how the model was developed, and how it is possible to graphically and com-putationally explore how these models can be used to make hypotheses about search behaviour. We will then show how the model was refined to include more variables (and thus become more realistic) [7].

A summary of the topics we shall cover in this section are: 1. Interactive Probability Ranking Principle [25] 2. Sensemaking and Cost Structures [37] 3. Optimal Foraging Theory [41] 4. Information Foraging Theory [32, 20, 34, 37, 38]: 5. Economic Theories: During this session activity sheets will be given to partici-pants to draw hypotheses from various models.
Part three will focus on optimisation models, in general, how to build such models, and how to use them to generate hypotheses using various methods (analytical, graphical and computational) [43, 31]. The essence of such models is to de-velop a cost function and a gain function given the different interactions that users can perform. Given these functions, it is then possible to establish under what conditions cost is minimized and/or gain is maximized. This section will explore the following topics:
To help illustrate how to undertake the model building process, we will use an example based on the simple scenario of finding the first highly relevant document in a result list. We will describe how we can characterize the problem, enu-merate the different variables, and show how the different variables impact the overall cost and the design of the inter-face. If time permits, then we will also include some notes on developing simulations to explore such models (i.e., com-putational approaches).
The final part of the tutorial will be dedicated to building a model. Participants will consider the problem of a user trying to find an app on a mobile phone or tablet. The goal here is to find the app that the user wants to use. So the focus will be on building a cost function to model the differ-ent ways in which the user can find the app, e.g. search or browse. To add realism to the scenario, we will consider dif-ferent types of users, ones that can remember where the app is, and those who cannot (i.e., best and average/worse cases) as well as consider how screen size and app icon size can be modelled to arrive at an optimal size and layout for such in-teraction. During the practical session, participants will be encouraged to abstract away the details to form a represen-tation of the problem, and identify the main variables that are likely to influence the interaction (i.e., number of apps on the phone, the number apps per page, the cost of moving between screens, etc). These will be used to formulate the costs, then we will be able to reason about when it is better to search for an app and when it is better to browse. We will also consider alternative designs, such as presenting the most used apps first, or a hierarchical browsing structure, and whether they are likely to be more efficient or not, or under what circumstances.
By the end of the tutorial, participants should be able to:
