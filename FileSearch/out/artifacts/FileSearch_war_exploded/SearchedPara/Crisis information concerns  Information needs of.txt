The summary and conclusions include implications for research and service. 2. Literature review: IPV context have 50 X 70% more problems with their physical health (Campbell et al., 2002, p. 1157 ) than their counterparts. The act of seeking help can actually undermine healing, particularly when the response is judgmental ( Morrison, Luchok, Richter, ther help X  (Campbell &amp; Raja, 2005, p. 97 ).

Although IPV occurs in all socioeconomic communities (Heise &amp; Garcia-Moreno, 2002 ), it has a disproportionate impact from gaining an education and/or job as well as those who have primary financial and parenting responsibilities for young
The social and workplace costs of this crime are also substantial, calling on government and private resources that, in Novaco, 2006; Nelson, Nygren, McInerney, &amp; Klein, 2004 ).

Studies indicate that 85% of IPV is male on female crime (McClennen, 2005; Rennison, 2001 ). Often under-reported and always difficult to measure (Bonomi et al., 2006; Waltermaurer, 2005 ), IPV attacks against almost 5.3 million U.S. women these women have developed a range of techniques for escaping abusers, protecting their children, contacting police, and bee, 2004 ).

While simply leaving might seem an obvious solution, the financial, legal, custodial, emotional, and safety issues can et al., 2003; Zink, Jacobson, Pabst, Regan, &amp; Fisher, 2006 ).

The point of separation is actually one of the most dangerous; estrangement is a primary risk factor in the murder of IPV any permanent, effective change can occur, survivors must be prepared both cognitively and affectively ( Felson et al., 2002; Shurman &amp; Rodriguez, 2006 ). 3. Literature review: IPV survivor information-seeking
Only limited research has addressed the information interactions of IPV survivors. Their general preference for informal, of Roma Harris and Patricia Dewdney X  X  Barriers to Information: How Formal Help Systems Fail Battered Women identified 18 separate problems (p. 79) and 23 different entities that were expected to provide help (p. 80). Conducted in Canada in a pre-Internet information world, this study highlighted the range of problems encountered by survivors in their efforts to sources (e.g., taxi companies, the YMCA, and Alcoholics Anonymous) (Harris &amp; Dewdney, 1994, p. 80 ). available. 4.

The crisis aspect of IPV experiences, however, requires that aspect of ELIS work that maximizes a focus on personal con-constraints ( Allen, 1997, pp. 120 X 121 ) influence information-seeking choices of individuals.
Acknowledging the enormous impact of those constraints, Dunne X  X   X  X  X erson-in-progressive-situation X  model (2002) was proposed specifically to address the situational changes faced by IPV survivors as they move towards some form of a safer as part of the individual X  X  information context. 3
Applying the person-in-progressive-situation model to the information needs of IPV survivors requires that a firm rela-balized gaps in knowledge or understanding that hinder movement towards a desired goal. The information needs may have gap is essential. Survivors progress through situations that regularly engender or trigger information needs. 5. Research question survivors themselves and of the two groups of first-responders who are most involved in their active contemplation of and movement towards change, namely shelter staff and police officers. (Given the small number of participants, no effort is the following research question:
What are the information needs of Intimate Partner Violence survivors who are in contact with domestic-abuse shelters and police departments?
Future studies are needed to address the information needs of IPV survivors who are not already in the shelter system or in contact with police departments. Their information needs may be quite different from those identified in this study. 6. Research method
The data derive from a series of in-depth, in-person interviews. Over a 10-week period, interviews were held with 24 the police officers were male with one exception. The cities were purposefully selected to maximize demographic diversity urban, and rural cities were included in 10 different counties. to take advantage of this extended access.

A total of 63 hours of audio-taped interviews were transcribed resulting in a total of 106,530 words. Personal histories tation could inadvertently identify an individual.
 The data were analyzed using the constant-comparison method of content analysis (Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985, pp. 339 X 344 ).

In addition, many survivors made statements which so clearly indicated a lack of information that those items the information need was so bound up with the fear of asking that nothing else mattered. For example, some survivors X  mation; however, they were so afraid of having the emergency protective orders lead to their abusers locating them that they neither sought the information nor desired to have it. Having that information may not, of course, lead to seeking the emergency protective orders; not having it, however, means that decisions are based on incomplete and/or inaccurate information.

Statements of seeking and desiring information were readily coded as such. Explicit observations that survivors lacked information from police and shelter staff were readily coded as such.

If survivors come to believe that they can live indepen-dently and safely, then the housing, job, education, and basics of living become primary areas of information need. Going back to Maslow X  X  hierarchy, survivors need information on a home, employment to pay for their essentials, an education to improve their lives, and those basics needed to launch that whole effort.

Implications for research and service police.

This article deals only with the information needs of IPV survivors. The entire study, however, garnered substantive data ative roles of affective and cognitive support in information experiences, and information-seeking patterns and problems. lic libraries, and the needs of those IPV survivors who are outside the system.

Much of the information is ephemeral and incompletely collected, particularly in low-income municipalities. Simply sive and difficult undertaking. Which low-cost housing has openings? Which companies have temporary and full-time posi-tions available? Which churches have openings in their low-cost daycare service? What documents do state agencies require for which service? Certainly the increasing use of the 211 system service is efficient and accurate in a particular city, what is the most effective use that shelters can make of it?
In addition to the ephemeral information, much of what IPV survivors require is process oriented and requires careful adherence to procedures. What happens in court when the abuser contests a divorce, a protection order, or abuse charges?
What is the correct process for obtaining mental health services for a teenager? Most of these processes involve possible tial explanatory notes. Usability research is needed on the more effective means of helping survivors move through these processes. What level of detail is most useful? When do videos of the inside of a courtroom provide reassurance and when or a web site? Using the person-in-progressive-situation framework, further research is needed to know how best to em-power survivors to make their own decisions regarding legal, social service, and health care processes.
In terms of both ephemeral and complex process information, public library reference service could certainly provide provide integrated support for survivors who must, otherwise, receive information somewhat piecemeal from those who menting a community-integrated service initiative in which the public library served as a one-stop information center for survivor information needs (including both ephemeral and process needs), a research study could evaluate the efficacy sis-based information needs  X  both personal needs, such as elder abuse, and civic needs, such as tornado recovery.
