 Search engines like Google, Yahoo and MSN can provide the search results from wide Internet based on the typical user quer ies. However, those search engines always display a long and flat returned list and the list has been ranked by their inner ranking methods. Although the returned list has been ranked, generally it was not applicable to users to browse. For example, a query like  X  X aguar X , search engines do not know which topic of the query the user wants to know. Hence the search engines seek and obtain the more popular web sites which they supposed about the query word  X  X aguar X  without considering the multiple meanings of query word.  X  X aguar X  has a few mean-ings such as  X  X  big cats X ,  X  X AC OS X ,  X  X ar brand X ...etc. The clustering on search re-sults is then useful for those queries which are short, non-specific or imprecise and it could ease the disorder of search result. 
The method for clustering of search results always utilize short web snippets as the information and then extracting the representative words from the snippets to be can-didate category names. In this paper, we enhanced the method proposed by Krishna Kummamuru[4] by adding some other augmented information to extracting the can-didate concepts. We also integrate the entropy calculation with Kummamuru X  X  clus-tering method to refine the terms selection steps. We consider that it is not enough to utilize the web snippets only to attain the final clustered result. We also make the structure of hierarchical clustering result by utilizing the collected candidate concepts. The hierarchical structure would represen t the relation between one concept and an-other concept. We modify the hierarchical tr ee construction step and simplify the rela-tion calculation to string comparison. For search result categorization, VIVISIMO (http://www.vivisimo.com) is one of the examples of clustered search engines on Internet. In [1], we know that the AOL portal adopted VIVISIMO on top of the search results provided by Google. Some of the other well-known clustered search engines like Clusty (http://clusty.com) and Kartoo (http://www.kartoo.com/) display their search results by applying relevant pictures or the graphic user interface. By offering these relevant figures, users could attain what information the query relates to more easily. Search results returned by Clusty ac-company some pictures related to the query users submit. 
Zamir and Etzioni presented an on-line search result clustered system called Grou-per [6]. Grouper is an interface to group search results into clusters dynamically. Mi-search engines. This method extracts salient phrases from the titles and the snippets to calculate the appropriate cluster name inst ead of consider all contents of the web pages. Ferragina and Gulli proposed a personalized search engine based on web-snippet hierarchical clustering [1]. They make the clustering search result focusing on user rather on query words. CAARD [3]utilize the relation between pair of concepts to determine that which concept is one of the sub-topics of the other clusters. DSP [2] apply a greedy method to build the concepts hi erarchy and it helps confirm that all sa-lient concepts would be included in the hierarchy. Krishna Kummamuru proposed an innovative hierarchical clustering method called  X  X isCover X  [4]. The word  X  X is-Cover X  means the short writing of  X  X istinctiveness X  and  X  X overage X . Clearly this method uses documents X  distinctiveness and documents X  coverage of each concept to calculate the ranking of all concepts extracted from web documents. We use one of the features called Cluster Entropy that proposed from [5]. In function g and the difference between a concept and a con cept set. However, the intersection of a concept and a concept set should be consid ered too. Hence we add a cluster entropy feature into original DisCover algorithm to adjust the clustered result. The formula for integration of the method is shown as follows: 
The value of Doc Entropy indicates the value of documents covered by j c distribute value of the under concepts of a concept j c distribute in the under concepts of a con-under concepts of j c distribute in under concepts of 1 ,  X  k S  X  . 3.1 Concept Hier archy Modification The method to construct the concept hierarch y in the CAARD [3] is to calculate each pair of concepts and clusters to distribute each rest concept that is not top level cluster into the most appreciate category. In our new hierarchy method, we do not utilize the value 0 (0 X 1 = 1 X 0 = 0). However we consider that the meaning of corresponding pair (0,0) and (0,1), (1,0) are different. We implement an on-line system that could cluster the top 100 search results returned by Google into several categories for our enhanced clustering methods. After users send their queries, our system applies the proposed clustering method to generate a concept hierarchy as shown in Fig. 1. User can choose the concepts they interest in to obtain the document results related to the concept. In our experiments, for each query we collect the top 100 search results returned by Google. We choose five Chinese ambiguous queries and five English ambiguous que-ries as shown in Table 1 to be our testing queries. We also choose five Chinese que-ries and five English queries with more specific meaning to be the other test queries. We collect the top 100 Google search results of these queries as our testing data set. 
In the experiment we examine for the coverage of each methods. We select the av-indicate the average coverage improvement extent for Chinese ambiguous and spe-cific queries. In these two figures we find that almost all of our methods would en-hance the coverage for a little degree. However the M1 is always with lower coverage ratio than DisCover method. M1 is the method that applying the heavier weighting to title terms. In M1 method it would attain more title concepts to be the cluster con-cepts. The title concept generally would not cover too many related documents. Therefore the coverage of M1 is almost lower than DisCover method. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 represent the coverage improvement for English ambiguous and specific queries. For English queries we would also enhance the coverage ratio. 
We propose a new manner to evaluate our new concepts hierarchy. We attempt to for each concept in level 2. Fig. 6 is an example of the concept hierarchy. The left part of Fig. 6 is the hierarchical result of CAARD [3] while the right part is the hierarchical result of our proposed hierarchical method. We could confirm that our hierarchical method could make the salient concepts more structural. From the hierarchical result we could attain the relation between each pair of the concept. The concepts which are in the deeper level of the hierarchy might be th e specific meaning concept for the query. In this paper, we proposed several new methods to enhance the final clustered results. We apply information theory to get the messy degree between a concept and a con-information of a concept and a concept set. From our experiment, these new methods could not only attain good clustered results but also save a lot execution time. We also proposed a new method to constr uct the concepts hierarchy.
