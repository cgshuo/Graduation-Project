Collaborative filtering is one of the most successful tech-niques on the web. The task of traditional similarity-based collaborative filtering is to predict new items X  ratings for active users based on similar users X  profiles [2]. Despite their success, similarity-based collaborative filtering t ech-niques have some major limitations. For example:
This paper presents our efforts to overcome above-mentioned limitations. To address the issue of scalability, each user acts as a peer and connects with each other to form a collabo-rative information sharing community, which is basically a P2P overlay network. The P2P-based architecture allows users to create and maintain their own ratings individually without any centralized computation and storage.

To counter the issue of sparsity , it is proposed that users depend on other users that they trust directly or indirectly to make predictions. A trustworthiness metric is proposed, which help users to derive the trustworthiness and make direct trust decision on another user. The trustworthiness metric is basically derived based on the previous experienc e with this user, and is computable for most users, even for pairs of users that have co-rated only one item in common.
Suppose there are two users, P s and P t , and P t is a user with whom P s has previous experience (i.e. P t  X  X  testimonies have been used by P s to make predictions). P s compiles its experience with P t in a form of table as shown in Table 1. In Table 1, Z denotes the number of possible rating points, and N is the total number of existing items co-rated by P and P t . Each cell n ij in Table 1 records the number of co-rated items on which P t  X  X  testimonies are j while P s ratings are i . Each cell is initiated with dummy experience number as 1 /Z . After P t shared testimonies as j for the first time, the dummy experience in all the cells of column j are cleared first, and then corresponding cell in column j is updated with real experience numbers. R i = P Z j =1 n C previous experience, P s can calculate P t  X  X  trustworthiness :
T r s,t is basically the degree of reduction in P s  X  X  uncer-tainty of predicting new items X  ratings given P t  X  X  testimonies, which can be measured as the reduction of proportion of incorrect predictions made in cases given P t  X  X  testimonies, compared with cases without P t  X  X  testimony. In Eq. (1), the first and second item in the numerator of the second for-mula are the proportions of the incorrect predictions made by P s in scenarios without P t  X  X  testimonies and given P testimonies respectively. It is noted that update of T r s,t triggered each time with the update of P s  X  X  experience with P .

T r s,t may take values in [0 , 1]. T r s,t = 0 means that P is not trustworthy for P s at all since P t does not reduce P  X  X  uncertainty at all. Whilst T r s,t = 1 implies perfect predictability of the new items X  ratings given P t  X  X  ratings.
When P s encounters a new item, it queries for testimonies on the new item from others. The testimony querying process is basically a parallel probabilistic random walk on the un-derlying P2P overlay network. P s first goes to each of its direct neighbors, then a number of random walks originat-ing from P s  X  X  direct neighbors are carried out in parallel on the underlying P2P overlay network. Suppose the random walker is currently at P t , it will choose to go to P d at next step with a probability equal to T r t,d . If a user (either an originating user or a user visited during the random walk) has rating on the new item, its rating is sent back to P s testimony and the random walk stops at this user. The ran-length is reached.

Testimony querying usually discovers more than one peer in the community that has rated the items before. It is not possible that P s has direct experiences with all these peers. Some form of trust propagation is hence employed to help P s establish indirect trust.

Suppose along a referral chain, P t is P s  X  X  immediate suc-cessor, and P d is P t  X  X  immediate successor. P s derives P trustworthiness through trust propagation as:
Then Eq. (2) is carried out recursively by P s over all the peers along the referral chain to reason about the trustwor-thiness of the peer at the other end of a referral chain.
After the testimony querying, P s can predict the new item X  X  rating based on the testimonies collected. The col-lected testimonies are adjusted before being used to make predictions if P s has previous experience with the peers who report the testimonies. Suppose one peer P x reports testi-mony on the new item O n as r x,n = v . P x  X  X  testimony is adjusted to P r s,x,n = i with probability n iv /C v . If P has no previous experience with P x before, P x  X  X  testimony r x,n = v is used directly without adjustment. If the testi-mony querying does not discover any testimony, P s selects a pseudo-testimony as P r s,x,n = i with probability R i /N from each of its current direct neighbors based on its previ-ous experience with them.

P s then predicts O n  X  X  rating as:
Here A s,n is the set of peers that have provided testi-monies (and pseudo-testimonies) on O n . Our first group of experiments is to study the accuracy of the proposed approach. The accuracy is measured in terms of Mean Absolute Peer Error (MAPE), which is basically the average of every peer X  X  (i.e. user) mean absolute differ-ence between the predicted ratings and the real ratings over all items. The smaller the MAPE, the more accurate the predictions. Table 2 lists the accuracy of the predictions d e-rived with the proposed approach in different settings, wher e 1 A path from P s to the peer who has rated the item before is called a referral chain . http://www.cs.umn.edu/research/GroupLens/data/.
 D and U denote the number of direct neighbors maintained by each user and the upper limit of referral chain length respectively. It is observed that increase in D and U can improve the accuracy of the proposed method. However, when D and U become larger, the improvement in the ac-curacy is not as significant as the one derived when D and U are relatively smaller.

Inspired by the results of the first group of experiments, we chose D = 50 and U = 5 to run the second group of experiments. The goal of the second group of experiments is to study the robustness of the proposed approach in the presence of noisy ratings. The robustness is measured in terms of the Power of Attack (POA) as proposed in [1]. Let O t be the targeted item of the malicious peers, and  X  be the set of peers who are predicting item O t  X  X  rating. The POA for a particular type of noisy rating AT K is measured by: r  X  a,t and r a,t are predictions made with and without the presence of noisy ratings respectively. r target is the target rating of the noisy ratings, e.g. r target = 1 for the item nuke, and r target = 5 for item push. A positive value of POA means that the predictions have been forced by the noisy ratings toward the target rating. Otherwise, POA gives a negative value and POA is 0 if there is no differ-ence in predictions made with and without noisy ratings. Table 3 lists the robustness of the proposed method in sce-narios which different ratios of users report noisy ratings. As reported in [1], when only 8% false profiles are presented in the MovieLens dataset to nuke the targeted item, most of the similarity-based collaborative filtering technique s will get POA larger than 0.5. It is thus shown that the proposed approach is more robust than the similarity-based collabo-rative filtering techniques.

Table 3: POA w.r.t. different noisy ratings ratios
We have proposed a trust-based collaborative filtering ap-proach, in which users make prediction of the new items X  ratings based on the ratings of other users that are trusted directly or indirectly. Experimental results based on a rea l data set have also been illustrated.
