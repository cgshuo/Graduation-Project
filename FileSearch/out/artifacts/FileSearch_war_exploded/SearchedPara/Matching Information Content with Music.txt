 This work addresses a particular kind of cross domain per-sonalization task consisting of selecting simultaneously two items in two different domains and recommending them to-gether because they fit the user preferences and also they fit well together. In particular, it is shown that given a per-sonalized recommendation for points of interests (POIs), the user X  X  selection of POIs can be influenced by enriching their presentation with music tracks that are matching the user X  X  profile and also the POIs. This paper presents the results of an online, live-users, experiment where we evaluated alter-native approaches for matching POIs and music, based on tagging and text matching.

Recommender systems are personalized information search and decision support tools that are generally designed to provide recommendations for just one type of information items, e.g., either movies, or CDs, or travels. Recently, there have been some attempts to combine information from different domains, introducing the notion of cross-domain recommender systems. These systems can reuse knowledge about the users, which is derived in one domain, e.g., CDs, to provide recommendations in another different domain, e.g., movies [7].

In my work I focus on a particular kind of cross-domain recommendation task, where two items in two different do-mains are selected simultaneously and recommended together because they fit the user preferences and they fit well to-gether. For instance, a person sightseeing a city may use such a recommender system running on her mobile device; the system can offer to the user a walking itinerary and, while the user is visiting the suggested points of interest (POIs), it could play a soundtrack which matches the visited POIs and enhances the experience. For instance, a user vis-iting a Gothic cathedral might hear a classical composition by J.S.Bach, or during a visit to a lively market square the user might be offered an amusing folk tune. Music matching techniques could be used not only in real-life mobile appli-cations for personalizing the travel experience with ad hoc music, but also when presenting information on-line (e.g. in tourism web-sites).

The general research problem which I intend to address in my thesis is related to matching heterogeneous objects. In particular, I will focus on designing effective ways to match music content to objects in other domains, or adapting mu-sic to certain context information. The goal of this research is to obtain more general music information retrieval meth-ods where the query is not just a set of low level musical features neither a set of metadata but situations and ob-jects that must be associated to the retrieved musical items. As a general approach, I intend to explore tags as a way for relating music domain to other domains.

The main research challenge I X  X  facing pertains with the complex, multi-faceted, and unclear relations between the music domain and other possible domains (e.g. location, images, text). There has been little work in the area of cross-domain music recommendations. The majority of mu-sic recommender systems focus solely on music domain and employ either collaborative recommendation techniques [1, 2], content-based techniques that rely on domain-specific metadata [4], or a combination of both [23, 10].

Some of the work related to matching music content with cross-domain objects has been done in the area of context-aware recommendations. Context-aware music recommender systems use the information about the user X  X  surroundings (time, weather etc.) to infer user X  X  music preferences [20, 21].

A large part of the research on music information retrieval and recommendation is focused on emotional properties of music and on methods for using these properties in music retrieval or adaptation. In this context, there have been attempts to extract the music mood from features of the audio signal [17]. Mood extraction from music has been used in systems like Musicovery [3], as well as in matching music to text or image content [9, 15].

However, it is still unclear how (and which) properties of music domain relate to the properties of other domains.
In a first case-study I have shown that the user selection of POIs can be influenced by providing a musical soundtrack matching the POIs included in the itinerary. Furthermore, simultaneously searching for pairs of matching POIs and mu-sic tracks can provide as good results as independently se-lecting a personalized set of POIs and then matching music tracks to the POIs. In other words, not only the music can be matched to a pre-selected itinerary, but also the discov-ered relations between music and a place can influence the itinerary selection process and to a certain extent substitute POIs personalization.

In this case study, I have explored the combined usage of a limited number of manually selected tags and textual descriptions as a way for matching music to POIs. The matching techniques are described in Section 3.

For evaluating the effectiveness of matching approach I have designed a web application that is described in Section 2. In Section 4 I describe the outcome of the conducted user study, and finally in Section 5 conclusions and future work directions are presented.
The case-study application offers the user itinerary recom-mendations for the city of Bolzano (Italy) and its surround-ings. Each itinerary is composed of three points of interest inside and around the city (monuments, buildings, nature parks etc.) accompanied by a soundtrack (one music track per POI). Two music genres -classical and rock -have been used in this study. The catalogues of POIs and music tracks have been selected manually.

For evaluation purposes the system computes two recom-mended itineraries with soundtracks using two randomly se-lected recommendation algorithms among three possible ver-sions (details in Section 3). The users are not aware of the different modes used in the recommendation process. After viewing the two recommended itineraries the users are asked to choose the preferred one. This allows evaluating the im-pact of different approaches to matching music and location on user decisions.

Figure 1 shows the logical architecture of our recommender system. It uses profile information for standard item per-sonalization as well as music-to-POI similarity for combin-ing music and POI in a joined recommendation. The main components are: the user profile, the POI profile, the mu-sic profile and the recommendation algorithm that consists of POI ranking, music filtering and music-to-POI similarity computation.

POI and music profiles contain text descriptions and tags that have been assigned to them manually. The set of tags used for tagging POIs and music was chosen from the  X  X ist of Adjectives in American English X  [19]. 38 adjectives were selected in such a way that each adjective could describe both location and a music track. The tagging was performed through a separate web application that allowed users to tag POIs and music tracks. Additional details of this case-study are presented in a previous work [14].
 Figure 1: Model of case study recommender system
The recommendation algorithm initially filters the music tracks and ranks the POIs according to the user profile infor-mation. Having obtained a set of music tracks and a ranked list of POIs it combines them in a joined recommendation. In this case study we focussed on three different approaches for combining music and POIs:
POI rank. In this approach, we assign to each of the top 3 POIs (from the ranked list of POIs) one music track chosen randomly from the set of filtered tracks. In this way the selected music is liked by the user but is not adapted to the POI. The order of the recommended POIs is determined by POI rank.

POI rank + music matching. In this approach, af-ter obtaining the ranked list of POIs, we assign the best-matching music track (from the filtered tracks) to each of the top 3 POIs. The music-to-POI similarity computation is described in Section 3.1. Here, the ranking of the recom-mended POIs remains identical to the first approach. Only the recommended music is different.

Music similarity rank. In this approach, we do not sim-ply assign music to the top ranking POIs, but rather com-bine the POI rank with the music-to-POI similarity score to produce a new ranking for the pairs of POIs and music tracks. We then recommend the top 3 pairs. The POI-music pair score is computed as follows:
Here P OIpers is the POI score obtained from the POI ranking algorithm and similarity is the music-to-POI simi-larity (see Section 3.1).
The music-to-POI similarity scores are stored in a matrix that is computed off-line since it depends only on static item profiles. The similarity matrix S is a P x M matrix where P is the number of POIs in the database and M is the number of music tracks in the database. Each element of the matrix S ij represents the similarity of music track j to POI i . Each similarity value is computed based on the profiles of the POI and the music track as follows: where tagOverlap is the cardinality of intersection of the tags in the POI profile with the tags in the music profile and textSc is the similarity of the text descriptions of the two profiles computed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation [8] and TF-IDF [22] representations of their text documents [14].
We have compared the number of times each recommen-dation algorithm was preferred by the users in their system trials. Figure 2 shows the selection probability of the three algorithms considering all session data together, and sepa-rately sessions where only classical or rock music was the preferred genre of the user. Selection probability is esti-mated as the ratio of times an itinerary with a soundtrack generated by one method was selected over the total number of times it was offered in one of the two suggested itineraries in a recommendation session. In this figure, POI rank , POI rank + matching , and music similarity rank are the different versions of recommendation algorithm.
 Figure 2: Selection probability of different algo-rithms
Considering all session data we see that both POI rank + matching and music similarity rank approaches are pre-ferred more often than the recommendations where music is assigned to POI without matching. This data supports our main hypothesis that the process of music matching to POI is beneficial and produces more satisfying recommendations. We note that even in the simpler algorithm, POI rank , the played music was selected among tracks of the user X  X  pre-ferred genre. So the played music was among the preferred type in all the three cases.

The results for session data collected separately for each music genre show that classical music listeners more clearly preferred the advanced recommendation techniques. In fact, these results show that when rock music was the preferred genre of the user no clearly preferred approach can be identi-fied and our research hypothesis cannot be supported. These results suggest that the effectiveness of the two proposed ap-proaches for matching music with POI depends on the genre of music preferred by the system users. Similar genre depen-dencies have been discovered by Li and Ogihara [16]. When classifying music into emotional categories they found clas-sical tracks easier to classify than some of the other genres.
As explained in the Introduction, this initial case-study is part of a broader research on a rather new topic in the area of multimedia and cross-domain recommender systems. The goal of this research is to obtain more general music information retrieval where the query is not a set of low level musical features nor a set of metadata but situations and objects that are associated with the retrieved musical item.

In this initial study we hypothesized that: a) user satisfac-tion for a POI recommendation can be increased by accom-panying POIs with music tracks that are coherent with the user X  X  profile and the POIs; and b) simultaneously selecting best-matching pairs of POI and music can provide more sat-isfying recommendations compared to the approach where first the POIs are selected and then music is matched to each POI.

The results of the system evaluation show that users more often prefer the itineraries generated using music match-ing to POI techniques. Therefore, we conclude that music matching has positive effect on user satisfaction and deci-sion making with the joined music and POI recommenda-tions. The similar performance of simultaneous music and POI selection compared to matching music with pre-selected POIs could mean that high similarity between a music track and a POI can compensate the lack of POI personalization. However, such results can also be caused by the relatively small set of music tracks, which resulted in similar music recommended in the two approaches.

The results showed that performance of the implemented algorithms depend on the music genre preferred by the users. Recommendation sessions where classical music was chosen tend to give better results with the music-to-POI matching techniques.

In future work we will deal with some technical limita-tions of the current approach and we will perform new user studies with a larger users X  population, a revised set of POIs and more music tracks. We observe that user studies in recommender systems are not very popular and most of the validations have been performed off-line; cross validating the accuracy of the recommendation in a given data set [5, 12]. So, our work is still among the few attempts to evaluate the recommendations with real users X  feedback rather than try-ing to reproduce the past user evaluations on recommended items.

In the new user studies we will focus on tag-based match-ing of music content to a cross-domain content. The re-search goals for my thesis include: comparing tags to other possible matching techniques (e.g. text-based matching, fea-ture classifiers etc.); evaluating the performance of different tag-based similarity measures [18]; determining the types of tags that should be used for cross-domain matching (emo-tional labels, physical quality labels); identifying the genres of music suitable for cross-domain matching as well as the types of cross-domain items suitable for matching with mu-sic content; evaluating the effectiveness of a general model for matching music to other domain content, as compared to personalizing the matching technique for separate users.
Moreover, during the described user study we observed that while POIs are mostly described by physical quality adjectives and music by sound quality adjectives, emotional tags are almost equally distributed between POIs and music. This induces us to conjecture that emotional tags could allow a more efficient music-to-POI similarity computation. Based on this observation I plan to test in a more precise way the role of emotional tags in matching heterogeneous items.
For this reason, I X  X  revising the set of adjectives used for tagging music and POIs. In the past, there have been multi-ple attempts to use emotional labels for music classification [6]. Several works have studied and selected a restricted set of emotional labels that can describe music. Hevner [13] sug-gested 8 clusters of descriptive adjectives that were revised and expanded by Farnsworth [11]. A more recent and elab-orated research on emotions evoked by music was carried out by Zentner et al. [24]. The proposed Geneva Emotional Music Scale (GEMS) consists of 9 emotional clusters with 4-5 adjectives in each group. I intend to use this model for re-tagging the items before further experiments.

Accordingly to this line of research I plan to revise the used dataset: add more classical tracks and remove rock mu-sic which did not perform well in previous experiment. An-other potentially useful music genre could be movie sound-track music, since it typically carries strong emotional mes-sages.

Finally, I plan to scale the matching approach and test the ideas with larger datasets as well as attempt using tagging data produced by a community of users like Last.fm [2]. The approach can be extended to use stream data for playing music. This could greatly expand the available data and increase the possibilities of the recommender system.
By the end of the work on my thesis I plan to implement a music retrieval service that retrieves a set of music items given an input of cross-domain items (or features). [1] Foafing the Music.
