 The concept of proxy signature was first introduced by Mambo et al. in 1996 [8]. Since Mambo el al.  X  X  scheme, many proxy signature schemes have been proposed[2,3,7]. Based on the ideas of secret sharing and threshold cryptosys-tems, Zhang and Kim et al. independently constructed the first threshold proxy signatures in [11] and [5], respectively. ID-based cryptography which was intro-duced in 1984 by Shamir [9]: the public key of each user is easily computable from a string corresponding to this user X  X  identity, (such as an email address), while the private key associated with th at ID is computed and issued secretly to the user by a trusted third party called private key generator (PKG). The first work on ID-based threshold proxy signature was proposed by Xu et al. [10].
To simplify the certificate management in traditional public key infrastruc-ture and overcome the drawback of key escrow in ID-PKC simultaneously, Al-Riyami and Paterson[1] proposed a paradigm called certificateless public key cryptography(CL-PKC) in 2003. The con cept was introduced to suppress the inherent key-escrow property of identi ty-based public key cryptosystems (ID-PKC)without losing their most attractive advantage which is the absence of digital certificates and their important management overhead. Like ID-PKC, cer-tificateless cryptography does not use public key certificate[1,12], it also needs a third party called Key Generation Center(KGC) to help a user to generate his private key. In their original paper[1], Al-Riyami and Paterson presented a CLS scheme. Certificateless cryptography have some advantages over traditional PKC and ID-PKC in some aspects. In this paper, we introduce the notion of threshold proxy signature into certificateless cryptography and propose a con-crete certificateless threshold proxy signature scheme with traceability. We employ some ideas of the certificateless signature scheme in [12], and the ID-based threshold proxy signature scheme in [6]. The proposed scheme involves five roles: the Key Generation Center (KGC), an original signer( OS ) with identity is the identity of the i th (1 i n ) member), a set of real signers RS = { t ) member), and a verifier. Our scheme consists of the following 8 phases.
MasterKeyGen: Given a security parameter k  X  Z , the algorithm works as follows: 1. Run the parameter generator on input k to generate a prime q , two groups 2. Randomly select a master-key s  X  R Z  X  q . 3. Set the system public key by P pub = sP . PartialKeyGen: Given a user X  X  identity ID  X  X  0 , 1 }  X  , KGC first computes Q ID = H 1 ( ID ). It then sets this user X  X  partial key psk ID = sQ ID and transmits it to  X  e ( psk ID ,P )= X  e ( Q ID ,P pub ).

UserKeyGen: The user ID selects a secret value x ID  X  R Z  X  q as his secret key usk ID , and computes his public key as upk ID = x ID P .

ProxyCertGen: The original signer, A issues a warrant  X  which contains all the delegation details, such as OS  X  X  ID, the limitations, the time-window, etc.
On inputs Params , original signer A  X  X  identity ID A , his partial key psk ID A U h h PS .

ProxyShadowGen: Each proxy shadow includes 2 parts: one from OS and the other from PS . 1. A chooses a random polynomial of degree t  X  1 with the secret value r A as 2. Each proxy signer B i verifies whether 3. Each B i (1 i n ) chooses a random number y i  X  R Z  X  q as her secret value, 4. Each B i chooses a random polynomial of degree t  X  1 with the secret value 5. Each B j verifies whether Sign: Given its proxy signing key, and a message m  X  X  0 , 1 }  X  ,all t members in RS execute the following procedures to ge nerate their partial signatures: 1. Each C i (1 i t ) randomly picks r i  X  R Z  X  q , computes R i = r i P , T i = 2. After receiving all other t  X  1 R j  X  X  and T i  X  X , each C i in RS computes R = 3. Each C i computes  X  e ( P,  X  i ( K i + Y i )), and sends them to clerk. ture by the following steps: 1. Compute H = H 5 ( M || W || t i =1 R i + t i =1 T i ). 2. Accept if all the following equation holds: 3. Compute S = t i =1 S i and publishes (  X , ( U A ,V A ) , T ,T 2 , ..., T t )) on message M ,averifierdoes: 2. Accept the signature if and only if the following equation holds: Trace: PKG could determine all the real signers by executing the following: 1. Verify the signature is valid. 2. Compute D 1 =( s  X  1 mod q ) T 1 . 4. Repeat the previous two steps until to trace out all the signers in the same The verifier accepts if  X  e ( H 1 ( C i ) ,R i )= X  e ( D i ,P )holds(1 i t ). 3.1 Correctness C defined in Section 2.
 Proof. Similarly, let Y i be the second part of proxy signing key from PS for real signer C With Lemma 1 and 2, we then show that Eq. 6 holds for our threshold proxy signature generated by following scheme.
 Theorem 1. If all participants honestly follow the scheme, then the threshold proxy signature can be successfully verified by Eq. 6.
 Proof. Equation 6 can be obtained as follows: 3.2 Security Analysis Now, we show that our scheme satisfies t he following security requirements: 1. Strong Non-Forgeability: Our proposed scheme is based on Zhang and 2. Strong Identifiability: It contains the warrant  X  in a valid proxy signature, 3. Strong Non-Deniability: The valid proxy signature contains  X  ,which 4. Prevention of Misuse: In our threshold proxy signature scheme, using the We have presented a traceable certificateless threshold proxy signature scheme from the bilinear maps, which allow an original signer to delegate her signing capability to a group of n proxy signers, and it requires a consonance of at least all proxy signers remain anonymous but can be traceable by KGC through a tag setting. We note that our scheme may be more efficient than threshold proxy signature schemes in traditional PKC since it avoid the costly computation for the verification of the public key certificates of the signers. And no key escrow in our scheme makes it impossible for the KGC to forge any valid signatures.
