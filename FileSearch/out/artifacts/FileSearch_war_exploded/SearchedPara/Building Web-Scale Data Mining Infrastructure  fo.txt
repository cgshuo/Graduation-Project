 Abstract. The competition in search has been driving great innovation and investment on next generation Internet services, with the goal of providing the computing platform for Internet economies on a global scale. Different from traditional Internet services, search involves myriad offline computations to analyze data at a very large scale, and an infrastructure for  X  X cale X  experiments is often required to evaluate the effectiveness of newly invented algorithms in a simulated  X  X eal X  environment. In this talk, I will first review a variety of new trends in computational economies on the Internet in which search and online advertising have become the driving fo rces in building underlying computing infrastructure. Then, I will introduce current efforts at Microsoft Research Asia on building this new infrastructure. I w ill also discuss how these efforts are influencing the design of next-generation search engines from an architecture stand-point. Some advanced search technologies based on the use of this infrastructure and deeper data mining on the Web will also be demonstrated.
