 Most approaches to modeling conversation are based on a strong notion of cooperation be-tween the dialogue participants (DPs). Traditional models using intentions (Cohen and Levesque, 1991), dialogue games (Power, 1979), shared plans (Grosz and Sidner, 1990) or collaborative problem-solving (Blaylock and Allen, 2005) ex-plain dialogue situations in which DPs recognise each other X  X  intentions and, at least to a certain ex-tent, accept each other X  X  goals when deciding on their actions. These assumptions are theoretically grounded, as most work in linguistics has consid-ered situations in which DPs share a common goal and cooperate to achieve it by means of conver-sation (Grice, 1975; Clark and Schaefer, 1989). They are also practically sound: dialogue models are usually implemented in the form of dialogue systems, built for the purpose of providing a ser-vice to their users (e.g., TRAINS (Allen and Schu-bert, 1991)). In this scenario, failure to cooperate, either on the side of the system or of the user, is against the premises on which the system is con-ceived and used.

In everyday conversation, however, a great many situations escape the arguments above. Con-
We take it for granted that, at some level, Pax-man and Howard are sharing a goal, for otherwise they would not be having an interview. Still, the exchange is clearly conflictive, to the point that their behaviour compromises the flow of the con-versation.
 Heritage (1998) analyses the distinctive roles of DPs in news interviews: 1
On this occasion, Howard provides an answer almost immediately and the flow of the conver-sation contrasts noticeably with that in (1). The investigation reported in this article aims at shed-ding light on the nature of non-cooperation in dia-logue, by capturing the intuitions that allow us to differentiate between both conversations in terms of participant behaviour.

Dialogue games supporters could say that there is a game that describes the interaction in the first example. While this might be true, such an ap-proach would force us, in the limit, to define one game for each possible conversation that would not fit a certain standard. Walton and Krabbe (1995) attempt a game-based approach in their study of natural argumentation. They claim that a rigorous model of conversational interaction is useful, but accept that most of the huge variety of everyday conversation escapes it. Dialogue games are based on strict rules that capture typical dia-logue situations while leaving out considerable de-tail. As example (1) shows, DPs behaviour can divert from the typical case in unexpected ways,
Nevertheless, the rules and patterns captured by game models are useful, as they describe the ex-pected behaviour of the DPs under a certain con-versational scenario. In our research, we aim at reconciling two worlds, using the insights from di-alogue games to provide a description of expected behaviour in the form of social obligations, but looking at naturally occurring cases that deviate from the norm. This, in turn, calls for a technique to measure non-cooperation in dialogue and in this paper we provide one that is theoretically sound and supported by empirical evidence.

The following section discusses levels of co-operation in dialogue; Section 3 presents an em-pirical study and a practical measure of non-cooperation in political interviews; in Section 4 we discuss related work, our working hypothesis and a methodology; and Section 5 has the conclusions. Cooperation in dialogue can happen at different levels. In most cases, conversation supports a so-cial activity that constrains the behaviour accept-able or expected from the participants. In addi-tion, conversational behaviour determines how co-operatively participants engage in a social activity. However, cooperation at the conversational level does not necessarily translate to the social level. Consider, for instance, a witness under interroga-tion in a U.S. trial refusing to answer a question by appealing to the Fifth Amendment of the Constitu-versational setting as established by law, although it is not cooperative in relation with the goals of the trial. Non-cooperation at the conversational level, on the other hand, usually results in lack of cooperation at the social level. Take as an exam-ple, the same witness remaining silent, rather than answering or appealing to the Fifth Amendment.
To illustrate further, consider a fictional alter-native to (1), where Howard replies by saying  X  X  will not answer that question, as it is not relevant to whether I exceeded the powers of my office X . 2 This is not cooperative for the interview, but it is so at the linguistic level. It would help in preserv-ing the flow of the conversation, e.g., by triggering a sub-dialogue to solve the disagreement.

The distinction between linguistic and non-linguistic (also called task-related, high-level or social) cooperation has been addressed before. At-tardo (1997) revisits Gricean pragmatics, relat-ing non-linguistic cooperation to participants X  be-haviour towards realising task-related goals, and linguistic cooperation to assumptions on their re-spective behaviour in order to encode and decode intended meaning. From a computational perspec-tive, Bunt (1994) relies on a similar distinction for defining dialogue acts. Also, Traum and Allen (1994) introduce discourse obligations as an alter-native to joint intentions and shared plans, to al-low for models of dialogues in which participants do not share the same high-level goals and where behaviour is also determined by  X  X  sense of obli-gation to behave within limits set by the society X  (Traum and Allen, 1994, p.2).

Walton and Krabbe (1995) proposed a typology of dialogue based on the initial situation trigger-ing the exchange and participants X  shared aims and individual goals. Based on their work, Reed and Long (1997) distinguish cases where participants follow a common set of dialogue rules and stay within a mutually acknowledged framework from a stronger notion in which their individual goals are in the same direction. Borrowing from the lat-ter, in the rest of the paper, we will speak of collab-oration when DPs share the same task-level goals, and use cooperation when participants follow the conversational obligations imposed by the social activity (i.e., linguistic cooperation as discussed above). We will not deal with collaboration here, though, as our focus is on non-cooperation. In this section, we describe an empirical pilot study aimed at identifying a set of features that distinguish cooperative from non-cooperative con-versational behaviour and at establishing a suitable domain in which to focus our work. 3.1 The Corpus We collected the transcripts of 10 adversarial di-alogues: 4 political interviews, 2 entertainment interviews, 1 parliamentary inquiry, 1 courtroom confrontation, 1 courtroom interrogation and 1 dispute. The corpus includes 2 collaborative polit-ical interviews for result comparison and is nearly
In a first analysis, we identified those surface features that characterised each conversation as conflictive: e.g., interruptions, short turns, unfin-ished adjacency pairs, verbatim repetition. Next, looking for a better understanding, we preformed an in-depth case study of one of the examples, ap-proaching the analysis from different angles.
By studying, e.g., the observance of turn-taking rules, the implicatures of the participants and, more extensively, how the case fitted within the normative framework proposed by Walton and Krabbe (1995), we were able to better identify the nature of non-cooperative features present in the dialogue and establish a formalisable framework for approaching non-cooperative dialogue.

As for the domain, the wealth of interesting con-versational situations that arise in political inter-views make a suitable context for this research. In the English-speaking world, journalists are well-known for their incisive approach to public ser-vants. At the same time, politicians are usually well trained to deliver a set of key messages when speaking in public, and to avoid issues unfavorable to their image. We will only consider naturally oc-curring (i.e. non-scripted) two-party interviews. 3.2 Degrees of Non-Cooperation Based on the analysis described above, we pro-pose a technique for measuring non-cooperation in political interviews using a set of non-cooperative features (NCFs). The number of occurrences of these features will determine the degree of non-cooperation (DNC) of an exchange.

We grouped NCFs following three aspects of conversation: turn-taking, grounding and speech acts (see Table 1 for a complete list).

Turn-taking rules (Sacks et al., 1974) estab-lish that speakers make their contributions at ad-equate places and in particular ways. Interlocu-tors in a political interview are expected to respect transition-relevance places, openings and closings according to social conventions. Failing to do so (e.g., by interrupting each other) constitutes a non-cooperative feature.

Grounding (Clark and Schaefer, 1989) refers to participants X  acknowledgement of each other X  X  3 contributions by providing evidence of under-standing (e.g, continued attention, relevant next contribution). In political interviews a question is acknowledged by rejecting it or by providing a di-rect answer. Likewise, answers are acknowledged by rejecting their relevance, by asking a next rel-evant question or by moving on to a new topical issue. Failing to provide sufficient evidence of un-derstanding is also a non-cooperative feature.
Speech Act theory (Searle, 1979) classifies ut-terances according to their associated force and propositional content. Going back to Heritage X  X  comment, in a political interview participants can fail to restrict their speech acts to the force and content expected for their role. Non-cooperative features related to speech acts include the inter-viewer expressing a personal opinion or criticising subjectively the interviewee X  X  positions and the in-terviewee asking questions (except for clarifica-tion requests) or making irrelevant comments.
We define the degree of non-cooperation (DNC) of a dialogue as the proportion of utterances with one of more occurrences of these non-cooperative computed for the whole conversation and also for each participant, by counting only occurrences of features and utterances from each DP.

As an example, consider an extended fragment of (1) annotated with non-cooperative features ( O : overlap; GF : grounding failure; UC : unsolicited comment; I : interruption; TC : topic change):
Table 2 summarises non-cooperative features, utterances and the degree of non-cooperation for each participant and for the whole fragment. Table 2: Computing the DNC for dialogue (3)
The DNC was computed for all the political in-terviews in the corpus. Table 3 shows the val-4 Table 3: DNC of political interviews in the corpus ues obtained. Adversarial interviews have a large number of NCFs, thus a high value for the DNC. On the other hand, collaborative exchanges have There have been previous approaches to modeling dialogue on the basis that participants are not al-ways fully cooperative. Jameson (1989) presents an extensive study for modeling bias, individual goals, projected image and belief ascription in conversation. User-model approaches are flexi-ble to account for intricate situations but, as noted by Taylor et al. (1996), can lead to problems like infinite regress in nested beliefs. Taylor (1994) addressed non-cooperative dialogue behaviour by implementing CYNIC , a dialogue system able to generate and recognise deception; a notion of non-cooperation weaker than the one we address.
More recently, Traum (2008) brought attention to the need for computational accounts of dia-logue situations in which a broader notion of co-operation is not assumed: e.g., intelligent tutoring systems, bargaining agents, role-playing training mainly aimed at creating virtual humans with abil-ities to engage in adversarial dialogue. Traum et al. (2008) present a model of conversation strate-gies for negotiation, that includes variables repre-senting trust, politeness and emotions, and a set of conversational strategies. Despite being adversar-ial in nature, the conversational scenarios are mod-eled by means of rules, that are followed by the interlocutors, according to the values of some of the variables. Hence, the dialogues are adversar-ial, but cooperative under our characterisation of linguistic non-cooperation, and it is not clear how effectively the model accounts for cases in which participants fail to follow the rules of a scenario. 4.1 Working Hypothesis Finding a suitable model of non-cooperative dia-logue involves bridging the gap between the the-oretical aspects mentioned so far and the evi-dence in the empirical data of the previous section. Following Traum and Allen (1994), we base on the hypothesis that non-cooperative features result from decisions that participants make during the conversation, by considering the obligations im-posed by the social activity and their individual goals, with an adequate configuration of the pri-orities for goals and obligations.

Thus, a participant with high priorities for in-dividual goals might compromise the workings of a conversation by choosing contributions that go against the norms of the social activity. On the other hand, participants with higher priorities as-sociated with obligations will favour contributions consistent with the rules of the social activity. 4.2 Research Methodology For the next steps of the project, we will construct a model based on the hypothesis and test it by
The construction of the model is a formaliza-tion of the working hypothesis, including rules for political interviews, goals, obligations, priorities and a dialogue management component. At the 5 moment of writing, we are investigating the line of research on obligation-driven dialogue model-ing, initiated by Traum and Allen (1994) and de-veloped further by Poesio and Traum (1998) and Kreutel and Matheson (2003).

For the simulation, DPs will be autonomous conversational agents with a cognitive state con-sisting of goals, a notion of their expected be-haviour in a political interview, priorities, and some knowledge of the world. We are currently implementing a prototype based on EDIS (Mathe-son et al., 2000). In this paper we presented an attempt to shed light on non-cooperation in dialogue by proposing a practical measure of the degree of linguistic non-cooperation in political interviews and a method-ology towards a suitable computational model. We would like to thank the NLG group at The Open University (especially Paul Piwek, Richard Power and Sandra Williams) for helpful dis-cussion and comments on previous versions of this paper; and three anonymous reviewers for thoughtful feedback and suggestions.
