 1. Introduction sentiment analysis.
 polarity a word receives as a function of its usage in a text. For instance, the adjective sense level. Given the sentence  X  These cheap products destroy local businesses  X  inexpensive  X  , the contextual polarity of  X  cheap  X  is not positive but negative (since the subject of  X  cheap products  X  , acts as a cause of destruction).

Take polarity preference (  X  to guarantee  X  ) is used without reference to a human subject. perceived?
Single polar verbs clearly induce contextual polarity. Neutral nouns inherit this contextual polarity. The verb with a positive polarity preference for its direct object, the prior polarity of contextually positive. However, the contextual polarity might be incompatible with the prior polarity. Take the war  X  . The verb  X  approve  X  has a positive polarity preference. But the first place, induce the contextual polarity of nouns.

We worked with a subset of nouns occur in our corpus. and their polar objects by applying the following restrictions:  X  based on the available dependency information, select all verbs and their objects,  X  cases),  X   X  lexicon and a list of neutral nouns). 3. Experimental setting I of polar verbs in order to reproduce the polarity of the nouns from the German polarity lexicon. gives a couple of examples (  X  abbauen  X  means  X  to reduce prior polarities of the nouns as specified in the German polarity lexicon. nouns and the number of negative nouns they have as their direct objects. We distinguish three frequency patterns: 1. verbs where one polarity is clearly prevailing, frequency counts do not indicate a clear-cut preference, 3. verbs where  X  more or less  X  both polarities occur with the same frequency. a direct object of such verbs. Actually, some affect verbs like bi-polar verbs turn out to be shifters  X  turning the polarity from positive to negative and vice versa (e.g. negative,  X  to lose fear  X  = positive). 3.1. The determination of polar and bi-polar verbs their direct objects and those verbs that tend to be  X  indifferent ad-hoc measure, we decided to use a statistical test, the chi-square test (see Fig. 3 ). threshold, the so-called null hypothesis ( H 0 ) is rejected and the alternative hypothesis ( H mean by these distinctions.

A verb is bi-polar, if the probability for both polarities is 0.5. would lead to a division by zero and on the other hand they would not be in line with the requirement that e continue with definition (2). We thus set up the test hypothesis shown in Fig. 4 . the strength parameter (see next section).

There are clear cases, e.g.  X  kompensieren  X  (to compensate) where the probability of a negative noun is 0.866 and 0.133 for a positive noun. nouns from the German polarity lexicon. This is described in Section 3.4 . 3.3. A voting approach for the induction of noun polarities held-out nouns from the polarity lexicon. For instance, if the (to be classified) noun the stability  X  , according to the polarity preference of guarantee ) N P ( n = NEG | guarantee ) = 0.9444 N 0.0555. However, with object.

We adopted a held-out scenario and removed a single noun from our triples (i.e. every triple with that noun) and
There are two parameters that influence the behaviour of the algorithm: 1. minfvn: the number of different verbs the held-out noun occurs with; 2. minfv: the frequency of the verb, the held-out noun occurs with.
 It turned out that the precision ranges from 81.97% up to 93.34% by varying these parameters. precision by simply setting the parameters accordingly.

The best result in terms of precision is achieved with minfvn (see the next section).

However, the question arises why precision drops while we increase the thresholds; e.g. moving from minfvn  X  though.

Another and quite to be expected factor is word sense ambiguity.

Related work there are a few approaches that strive to clarify the impact of verbs, e.g. [9 approach, verb classes are used to specify the effects on the grammatical roles of verbs (subject, direct object, depends on the polarity of the subject and the direct object. E.g. an instantiated verb frame of the verb subject is negative and the direct objects is positive (  X  derivable about the polarity preferences of these verbs, e.g. that approach reveals, so these two approaches are complementary in a way. 6. Summary and conclusion
We have introduced a corpus-based method to both detecting verbs that have a polarity preference towards their direct with held-out data showed, the polarity preference of verbs can be reliably learned. might be better to remove highly ambiguous words from the lexicon Acknowledgements reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.
