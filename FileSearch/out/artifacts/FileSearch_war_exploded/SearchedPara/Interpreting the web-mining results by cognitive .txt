 1. Introduction
The use of web-based systems has grown considerably as a distribution channel for products and services offered by var-management (CRM) issues have arisen in business circles, most modern firms that operate websites are now adopting web-mining as a strategic way of capturing knowledge about the potential needs of target customers, future trends in the market, and other important management factors ( Soriano-Asensi et al., 2008; Tao, Hong, &amp; Su, 2008 ). Many machine-learning tech-niques can be applied to web mining to extract knowledge from web documents. However, the most critical problem with web mining is the poor interpretability (i.e., capability to make inferences and conclusions) of mining results (or knowledge) ( Hung, Lin, &amp; Hong, 2010; Shih, Chiang, Lai, &amp; Hu, 2009 ).

Cognitive maps are able to represent given problems as a directed graph of important factors that are interconnected with appropriate connection weights ( Park &amp; Kim, 1995; Pedrycz, 2010 ). The most relevant advantage of a cognitive map is its capability of upgrading the interpretability of web-mining results. In a word, causal knowledge seems not only natural and more readily understandable to decision-makers, but also richer for the purposes of interpretation. The association  X  rule approach (ARA) has been a popular method for extracting IF-THEN rules from weblog data, which are left by custom-ers visiting websites ( Changchien &amp; Lu, 2001 ). An a priori algorithm is a typical technique used for the association rule approach.

This study tests two approaches, the cognitive map approach (CMA), based on the cognitive map-based web-mining tech-nique, and the association rule approach (ARA), based on the conventional web-mining technique (the a priori algorithm in this study) to determine whether the effects of perceived usefulness, causality, and information richness on the attitude toward the actual use of and the behavioral intention to use CMA and ARA are significant. CMA is an application of cognitive maps to the process of making inferences and conclusions from web-mining results, and ARA is a way of building conclusions from the IF-THEN results of web mining. A revised technology acceptance model (TAM) is tested to investigate the effects of perceived usefulness, causality, and information richness. 2. Theoretical background 2.1. Cognitive map approach
Cognitive maps are signed directed graphs that provide feedback. They model a given environment as a collection of con-cepts (or factors) and causal relations between concepts. Many research studies that apply the basic concept of cognitive maps have been presented in the field of business and other social sciences. For example, Miao, Liu, Tao, and Shen (2002) proposed ways in which fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) design could be simplified. Georgopoulos, Malandraki, and Stylios (2002) suggested the use of FCMs in the diagnosis of language impairment, while Lee, Kim, Chung, and Kwon (2002) utilized FCMs to analyze weblog data that contain useful (but more often less important) or meaningful information. Kang, Lee, and
Choi (2004) suggested that casual relationships exist among the factors in the partnerships of airline service companies. Lee et al. (2004) applied FCM to evaluate EDI performance based on structural equation modeling approach. Lee and Lee (2007) have used FCM to design Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) controls.

The cognitive map-based reasoning is more advantageous than the fuzzy approximate reasoning ( Tounsi, 2005 ) for the following two reasons: (1) cognitive maps represent a set of  X  X  X ausal X  X  relationships between concepts; (2) in a cognitive map, a causality value e ij lies in the interval [ 1, 1] while the approximate reasoning approach uses fuzzy logic in its oper-ation, which indicates that it considers fuzzy values only in the interval [0, 1]. 2.2. Association rule approach
Among various data mining techniques, ARA has been popular in marketing intelligence fields. Association rule mining is derived from the data mining approach, which is as the process of efficiently discovering meaningful rules from the large collections of data. However, ARA focuses on finding association rules such as  X  X  X ) Y with support A% and confidence B%, where X and Y are sets of items X  X , from the transactions in databases.

The association rules concern whether a group of variables (usually two variables are considered) is more significantly associated than we would normally expect ( Berry &amp; Linoff, 2004 ). A great deal of research has been conducted about the use of ARA in a variety of domains. For instance, one application of ARA in finance can be found in the work of Liao, Ho, and Lin (2008) in which ARA is used to propose the stock category associations and the possible stock category investment collections on the Taiwanese Stock Market. Wang, Yeh, Huang, and Chang (2009) implemented the common association rule method to data mining for the design of a supplier evaluation model that incorporates Particle Swarm Optimization to iden-tify the optimal combination. Kim (2009) found predictive and useful association rules with a new web-mining algorithm, a streaming association rule (SAR) model that introduced a novel way to incorporate a sequential navigation order to find interesting associations among web pages.

The a priori algorithm ( Agrawal, Srikant, &amp; Vu, 1997 ), one of the prevalent ARA, is adopted in this paper. An a priori algorithm operates in two phases. In the first phase, all the transaction sets are generated with the downward closure property of support. In the second phase, the association rules are generated from all the transaction sets. 3. Research model
This study intends to examine, according to a revised TAM, whether perceived usefulness, causality, and information rich-ness significantly affect the user X  X  attitude towards the use of and behavioral intention to use CMA and ARA. TAM is a very rigorous model with which to explain users X  attitude towards the acceptance of technology ( Davis, 1989 ). In the original TAM, the two  X  X  X erceived X  X  constructs (ease of use, usefulness) influence attitude, which in turn affect behavioral intention.
In the proposed revised TAM used in this study, perceived ease of use is replaced with two new constructs, causality and information richness, with a view toward investigating two research objectives:
The first objective is to determine whether causality and information richness have positive relationships to attitude. If they do, we can claim that causality and information richness should be explicitly considered in choosing web-mining tech-niques for future analysis of web-mining results.

The main objective is to test the relationship in the proposed model empirically to determine whether the information richness derived from cognitive map-based web-mining reasoning is better than that derived from ARA based on a conven-tional web-mining reasoning approach. Fig. 1 depicts the proposed structural model, in which all the path coefficients are assumed to be positive.

The structural model consists of five constructs: perceived usefulness, causality, information richness, attitude, and behavioral intention. This structural model will be applied to CMA by using the cognitive map-based web-mining tech-nique and to ARA by using the conventional web-mining technique (the a priori algorithm in this study). A comparison of results can indicate whether CMA based on the cognitive map-based web-mining technique can strengthen positive atti-tude and behavioral intention to use technology more strongly than ARA based on the conventional web-mining technique.
 behavioral intention. Causality is defined in this study as the extent to which results are suggested by the web-mining sys-tem according to a user X  X  expectation (e.g., positive or negative change in results). Causality, under the web-mining system, can be expressed in various forms by the extent of the cause-effect relationship. Information richness is used to measure both the information quality and decision-support quality provided by the web-mining approach under consideration. The research hypotheses are as follows: Hypothesis H1-1: Perceived usefulness is positively related to the use of CMA.
 Hypothesis H1-2: Causality is positively related to attitude toward the use of CMA.
 Hypothesis H1-3: Information richness is positively related to attitude toward the use of CMA.
 Hypothesis H1-4: Attitude towards the use of CMA is positively related to behavioral intention to use CMA.
 Hypothesis H2-1: Perceived usefulness is positively related to attitude toward the use of ARA.
 Hypothesis H2-2: Causality is positively related to attitude toward the use of ARA.
 Hypothesis H2-3: Information richness is positively related to attitude toward the use of ARA.

Hypothesis H2-4: Attitude toward the use of ARA is positively related to behavioral intention to use ARA. 4. Methods 4.1. Measures of constructs
Davis (1989) pointed out that the validity of a measurement scale is built from the outset. Therefore, it is well known that items selected for the constructs were mainly adapted from prior studies to ensure the content validity. Statements used to operationalize perceived usefulness, attitude, and behavioral intention were basically adapted from Davis (1989) with minor changes in wording to fit the specific technologies studied. Causality means interrelated relationships between some inputs and corresponding outputs, where inputs may represent system menus or stimuli, and outputs may imply corresponding results. Considering its characteristics, causality was newly measured by three statements to express causal relationships between input information and its possible results (statement 1), result and its possible causes (statement 2), and input conditions X  changes and corresponding results (statement 3).

Information richness, indicating the level of decision-support quality and information quality provided by web-mining are affected by results format and contents. If the format of inference results is user-friendly, and the contents of inference results are good enough to meet user X  X  expectation level, then we can say that inference is rich. For instance, the inference using cognitive map is rich, as the cognitive map is able to represent given problems as a directed graph of important factors interconnecting each other with appropriate connection weights. Once cognitive map is obtained for a given decision-making problem, then decision-makers can apply a series of interpretation procedures by taking advantage of its causal knowledge representing power. Causal knowledge is similar to IF-THEN rules with many differences. In one word, causal knowledge seems natural and more understandable to decision-makers but more rich in interpretation ( Lee &amp; Kwon, 1998; Noh, Lee, mat, and they should support decision-making adequately. Questions regarding information richness are composed of three statements  X  the first statement relates to information relevance with decisions, the second statement to improvement of problem-solving ability, and the third statement to user-friendliness of information format. In questions, respondents were asked to express his or her agreement with the statements, based on the five-point Likert-type scales with anchors ranging from  X  X  X trongly agree X  X  to  X  X  X trongly disagree X  X . Appendix lists the questions of the questionnaire used in this study. 4.2. Procedures
The validity of the proposed model was tested against data obtained from undergraduate students who were trained to understand and experience the important characteristics of web-mining applications in class administered by authors. We tested our proposed research model with structural equation modeling as suggested. In this regard, we plan to investigate the difference between CMA and ARA.
 testable sample. A structured questionnaire was the main method of data collection. The mail survey method was avoided because of the difficulty in obtaining reliable responses from the questionnaire, which addressed such specialized issues as
Web mining. On the other hand, a field survey based on direct contact stimulates trust and cooperation, which are often re-important to make sure that these items could be answered by practitioners. The personal contacts provided the opportunity to aid the respondents in their interpretation of the questions and to allow flexibility in determining the sequence and word-ing of questions. A questionnaire was designed and tested against the respondents chosen for this study. The respondents were from an undergraduate class named  X  X  X nternet and Management X  X  administered by authors. The class purpose was to teach details about decision makings on the Internet including web-mining techniques. Before questionnaire survey, we as-signed one assignment related with CMA and ARA ( a priori algorithm) to get the students to understand the practical mean-ing of CMA and ARA. In addition, we announced that additional bonus credit would be given to those students who submitted questionnaires without missing and apparently skewed distribution of answers. After checking all the assign-ments submitted by the students, we concluded that all the students understood meanings and basic features of the web-mining techniques including CMA and ARA.

On the day of questionnaire survey, we discussed again basic features and practical meaning of CMA and ARA by showing them a number of power point slides summarizing web-mining techniques, and then 110 questionnaires were distributed in class and collected with the response rate of 100%. While the students were answering questionnaires, the authors attended and monitored. Of the 110 questionnaires returned, 104 proved valid for statistical analysis.

The questionnaire data were analyzed using structural equation modeling approach which has gained popularity in quite a age used for analysis is AMOS version 4.01 (SPSS Inc.). Structural equation modeling requires that the measurement model should first be assessed and then fixed based on chi-square statistics before estimates on each path are examined. The paths in the structural model represent relationships between the model constructs, so that an estimate on each path means a degree of causality from an independent construct to a dependent construct ( Kline, 1998 ). After exploring all the paths in the structural model from a statistical viewpoint, the best fitting model can be found. The interpretation of such  X  X  X est X  X  fit model allows us a lot of valuable information on how some constructs are causing influences on target constructs via a set
The minimum sample size for reliable analysis using structural equation model is ranging from 100, 150 to 200 or more in order to generate the parameter estimates with standard errors small enough to be of practical usefulness. The data set used in this study has a sample size of 104. Given that our structural model is relatively simple with five constructs, the sample size is considered adequate. 5. Results 5.1. Test of measurement models
Our research model requires structural equation modeling, which has gained popularity in recently published MIS studies ( Gefen et al., 2003; McKinney et al., 2002 ). The software package used for the analysis is AMOS version 4.01 (SPSS Inc.). Confirmatory factor analysis is applied in order to build and verify the validity and reliability of the measurement model.
To test the goodness-of-fit of the measurement model, we have to consider several measures: chi-square/degrees of freedom should be less than 3.0, the adjusted-goodness-of-fit-index (AGFI) should be greater than 0.80, the normed fit index (NFI) should be greater than 0.90, and the root-mean-square-residual (RMSR) should be less than 0.10 ( Gefen et al., 2003 ). The overall fit indices shown in Table 1 indicate a good model fit for both web-mining approaches. The overall fit indices for the cognitive map approach also indicate a good model fit (chi-square/ df = 1.399 &lt; 3.0, AGFI = 0.814 &gt; 0.8, NFI = 0.90,
RMSR = 0.029 &lt; 0.1). For the association rule approach, the overall fit indices evidence good support for the good fit within a statistically acceptable range.

The convergent validity of measures should be supported by item reliability, construct (composite) reliability, and aver-age variance extracted. Item reliability is the amount of variance in an item due to the underlying construct. From Table 1 , the individual item loadings for the cognitive map approach lie between 0.780 and 1.058, and those for the association rule approach range from 0.882 to 1.230. All the t -values for the item loadings are above 8.0, indicating that they are significant from 0.7912 to 0.9210 for the association rule approach and 0.7895 X 0.9056 for cognitive map approach, are greater than 0.70. Therefore, construct reliability is assured. The average variance extracted, which should be above 0.50, measures the amount of variance explained by the construct. Table 1 shows that the average variance extracted for both the association rule approach and the cognitive map approach exceeds 0.50, implying that each construct is obtained properly and signif-icantly represents items. Therefore, all these measures strongly support the convergent validity of constructs that we derived from data, showing that the constructs can be used in future research studies.

In order to test discriminant validity, the average variance extracted for each factor is compared with the square of cor-relations between that factor and all other factors. Second, if the average variance extracted for a factor is greater than the other exceptions to the cognitive map approach: a squared inter-factor correlation of 0.596 was found for information rich-ness and attitude, which exceeded the variance extracted for causality (0.5632) and the information richness (0.5566), respectively. There is a single exception for causality in the association rule approach: a squared inter-factor correlation of 0.604 found for information richness and causality, which exceeded the variance extracted for the causality factor of 0.5590. The difference, however, was small; the discriminant validity of measures is moderately ensured. 5.2. Test of structural models
This structural equation model includes five constructs, assuming that three constructs, perceived usefulness, causality, and information richness, would positively influence attitude. The goodness-of-fit indices for the cognitive map approach are chi-square/degrees of freedom = 0.837 ( p = 0.473), GFI = 0.990, AGFI = 0.952, NFI = 0.993, and RMSR = 0.013, all of which are within acceptable levels. The goodness-of-fit indices for the association rule approach are chi-square/degrees of free-dom = 1.073 ( p = 0.359), GFI = 0.988, AGFI = 0.939, NFI = 0.991, and RMSR = 0.019, all of which are within acceptable levels. All the path coefficients between constructs are statistically significant with at least 0.05 significance.

The test results, shown in Fig. 2 , support all the hypotheses from H1-1 to H2-4. The path coefficient of causality in the cognitive map approach (0.220) is smaller than that in the association rule approach (0.302), while the path coefficient of information richness (0.453) in the cognitive map approach exceeds that (0.375) in the association rule approach. Informa-tion richness in the cognitive map approach has a more positive relationship with attitude than that in the association rule approach. Fig. 2 shows the results for each sub-model.

As shown in Fig. 2 , the two sub-models produce statistically significant results. The overall goodness-of-fit indices are within acceptable levels, and all the path coefficients are meaningful at the 0.01 and 0.05 significance levels. The test of a structural model shows that the path coefficient of information richness towards attitude in the cognitive map approach (0.453) is greater than that in the association rule approach (0.375). We can conclude that information richness in the cog-nitive map approach influences attitude more positively than in the association rule approach. Structural equation modeling with a real data set revealed that these approaches are comparable in terms of their significance in the paths from perceived usefulness, causality, and information richness to attitude towards the actual use of and the behavioral intention to use the approaches. The path between perceived usefulness and attitude is weaker than any other paths which show that users use
CMA or ARA because they provide causality and information richness rather than they are perceived to be useful which may not appear direct cause for the use of CMA or ARA. CMA or ARA are used because they improve interpretability by examining the causality among factors and can provide in-depth information about the decision problems that users face. 6. Implications
Cognitive maps are used as support tools for making causal inferences and conclusions from web-mining results. Since web-mining results are usually hard to interpret, cognitive maps are deemed suitable for improving their interpretability by elucidating causality among rules. The association rules mining techniques, typically characterized by a priori algorithms, have satisfied practitioners as well as researchers, because they provide easily understandable IF-THEN rules from large
Nestorov, 2006 ). The experimental results show that CMA and ARA are comparable tools for producing more powerful interpretability.

Based on these study results, perceived usefulness, causality, and information richness are important in forming the user X  X  attitude toward the actual use of and the behavioral intention to use CMA and ARA. CMA and ARA are comparable in their strength and in the significance of paths in the revised TAM, indicating that users perceive that these approaches are almost equally worthy of being applied to the process of making inferences and conclusions from web-mining results, which require usefulness, causality, and information richness. Users will take into account that these cognitive maps and association rules are similarly effective in fostering usefulness, causality, and information richness, which helps to form their attitude toward the actual use of and behavioral intention to use these approaches. Decision-makers attempting to make inferences and con-clusions from web-mining results by using the cognitive map approach can expect the similar levels of usefulness, causality, and information richness when using the association rule approach. 7. Concluding remarks
We described two approaches, the cognitive map approach (CMA) and the association rule approach (ARA), and compared their effectiveness for evaluating the user attitudes toward the approach. For the sake of rigorous analysis, we introduce two new constructs, called causality and information richness, in supporting decisions, and adopt the structural equation mod-eling approach to perform experiments. Results reveal that CMA is comparable to ARA in terms of decision and causality.
CMA is intrinsically capable of making inferences according to a chain of the causal relationships among a number of variables. ARA enables meaningful information to be found when it is applied to web-mining results, such as IF-THEN rules, which themselves entail a chain of the causal relationships among IF variables and THEN variables. CMA and ARA can contribute to improving decision-making and provide the causal support to make decision-makers understand clearly the causal relationships between inputs and outputs. If CMA and ARA are effective in helping decision-makers understand the causal relationships between inputs and outputs, then decision-makers will have more positive attitudes towards CMA and ARA.
