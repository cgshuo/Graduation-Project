 Conflict and disruption are a part of everyday life, yet research in the home largely examines consensus and rituals . In this paper, we use Holmes and Rahe X  X  categorization of major life events in order to investigate disruption within the home. We examine posts contributed to an online technology support board and show how life disruptions fundamentally impact technology practices and routines. We conclude that examining technology in the context of life disruption is a worthwhile area for further work.

 Design Disruption, help -seeking, home, family, social computing, technical support, residential mobility Computing research has expanded from studying groupwork in organizations and workplaces to the home. Yet most work in this area assumes relative domestic harmony ; people share work on calendars, stay in touch with friends and family , and care for their children [1,2]. Yet the home is not always a place of consensus. What happens when conflict and change arise within the home? How do people manage their home technologies? We contend that HCI research needs to incorporate life disruptions and conflict around home technology use . In order to investigate co nflict and technology within the home, we captured over four years of posts from a large online technical support board focused on support for consumer electronics products sold in the United States. Using Holmes and Rahe X  X  categorization of major life eve nts [3] as a guide, we isolated posts related to common life disruptions and conflicts , such as death, lists forty -three differen t life events ; the top stressful events include death, divorce, imprisonment, illness, marriage, unemploy ment , retirement, and pregnancy. T hese events are assigned a point value between 1 and 100 (where a greater number indicates higher potential impact on health .) We collected content posted to a technical support board hosted by a large, consumer electronics corporation headquartered in the United States. This company sells a wide range of products, including desktop computers, laptops, peripherals, and portable media devices, and provides consumer -driven forums for people to discuss the company X  X  products, as well as ask for advice about purchasing, warra nty, and technical support issues. The dataset includes content posted from 2003 to 2007 , which included 50,000 users with 110,000 unique posts; posters  X  technical skill level varied in ability from newcomer to expert . We merged the top twelve most stress ful events in the Holmes and Rahe stress scale [3] (see Table 1) into eight life events: marriage, death, divorce, unemployment, impr isonment, pregnancy, illness, and retirement. We selected sets of keywords based on each item and searched for posts containing any of these phrases. We selected a subset of 112 posts related to personal life events from the dataset . We examine these posts to highlight potential areas for further work in life disruption. We cannot tell to what extent the posts described here are representative of all board users or the broader population of computer users but think this is an important area for future work . We focus our analysis on five categories: relationship management (marriage and divorce), death, unemployment , illness, and retirement. We did not observe any posts referencing pregnancy or imprisonment. One reason may be lack of Internet access or use , e specially among prisoners. In both cases, as technology becomes more mobile and ubiquitous; we anticipate that kinds of questions among broader demographics of users will continue to grow . Three researchers analyzed each post independently . T he data were coded for the type of support requested and supplemented with a descriptive analysis of content . Researcher s coded the data individually and discussed each event as a group until reaching a mutual agreement . Marriage and intimate relationships change d home technology use ; d evice ownership merge d, partners had share d accounts, and partners may have had different sets of expectations about technical knowledge and use. For example, Jason  X  X  1 computer belonged to hi s wife until they got married. Jason tried reinstalling Windows XP to fix her computer and a fterward was unable to reconnect it to the network. He wrote : Divorce and breakups also altered roles and responsibilities. One poster had never managed a new computer because her ex -husband  X  X lways controlled these things . X  She came to the board seeking to learn skills that her ex -husband had done for her . Names changed for anonymity.
 Another unanticipated consequence of death was the loss of the technical knowledge that the deceased person had. Loss of knowledge snowball ed into larger problems : p aying bills, managing documents, and archiving photos on someone else X  X  computer , all of which were daunting and unfamiliar process es for someone left alone who had depended on a par tner to do these things. One poster wrote : Access to technology wa s essential for most upwardly mobile job seekers who had changed or lost a job [15] . More so , technological breakdowns limit ed access to and communication with potential job prospects . One unemployed poster was unwilling to sub mit his resume online until he kn ew he it was properly protected from viruses. Technical expertise wa s also related to managing finances and collecting unemployment benefits. Another poster had problems op ening the unemployment benefits file she had to fill out. She wrote : The financial burden incurred with unemployment was a common problem and impacted the kinds of job searches job seekers could perform : Many people wanted to develop their technical expertise and increase their marketability, but they were unable to set up the technology needed to learn these skills . Health problems and illnesses presented new caretaking responsibilities for friends and fami ly members. Jim X  X  sister fell ill with multiple sclerosis and he need ed to provide Internet access for her : His sister had no other outlet to the outside world and finding a laptop for her was imperative to him. Jim had tried to install his router software unsuccessfully; he had also tried system restore and had hit abort inadvertently, leaving him with a computer that did not boot.
 Joel similarly was caring for his terminally ill brother, who was living in a hospice house and wanted a laptop. However, Joel could not provide one , lamenting:  X  X ith all the hospital bills there is no way I can make such a large purchase. X  Joel called the company's support line, and they suggested he post to the forum asking if anyone knew of any charity programs. Finally, r etirement change d technological needs and support. Those who relied on tech support from their employers had to find new sources of help. Those who started new hobbies face d new costs associated with these activities, and on a more limited income than they were previously accustomed to. Some key themes emerge across these kinds of life disruptions. When a person leaves another person X  X  life, by way of relationship dissolutio n, death, or any other means , her expertise and information goes with her . Often , one person in a relationship or household is responsible for technical maintenance; and when she is no longer present or available , an understudy must take on her role. Critical informat ion is also lost  X  X his includes computer or account passwords, financial informat ion, finance management (i.e. bill paying), and other personal data [18] . Technical roles and identities also change after a disruption. After a change in a relationship, death, or when someone falls very ill, the role of who does the technological work may shift. A caretaker of someone who is sick must now assu me the role of technological caretaker in addition to responding to health needs ; this can also be financially burdensome. After divorce and death, those who did not do the technological maintenance may find themselves bearing this role, or looking for oth ers to fill it. Changes in personal identity, such as last names in the formation and dissolution of relationships, must be reflected in the technology. Technical trust and privacy also change in relationships, both in formation and dissolution. Sometimes , people trust another person to maintain their information and technologies in the formation of relationship. Later , their trust decreases in the dissolution of a relationship, and they want to protect their personal data and shared technologies from their ex-partners. Finally, conflict or life disruptions necessitate new technical skills. In the case of unemployment, new technical skills, such as online job search and resume submission, are essential to finding a job. Many government processes of un employment have become digitized. In this case, new skills may be required even to collect unemployment benefits. Relationship changes, retirement, and unemployment can all require new skills in technical management and maintenance. The study and design of technology has expanded from the workplace and public sphere into the private sphere of the home. Research in the home looks at the  X  X veryday X  and  X  X ituals X  ; yet change, conflict, and even violence can be part of ordinary life experiences. Th is paper illustrates that life disruptions and conflict are indeed intertwined with maintaining home technologies. By examining conflict and life disruption in the home, we have illustrated how home technological maintenance is affected; namely, by a loss of expertise and information, changes in trust and privacy, changes in technical roles and identities, and technical skill requirements. This work serves as a starting point to consider how conflict complicates home technology maintenance, and how disrupt ions need to be considered along with the every day. [1] A. Crabtree, T.
