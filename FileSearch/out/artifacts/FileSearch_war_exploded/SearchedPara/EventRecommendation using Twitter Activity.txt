 User interactions with Twitter (social network) frequently take place on mobile devices -a user base that it strongly caters to. As much of Twitter's traffic comes with geo-tagging information associated with it, it is a natural plat-form for geographic recommendations. This paper proposes an event recommender system for Twitter users, which iden-ti es twitter activity co-located with previous events, and uses it to drive geographic recommendations via item-based collaborative ltering.

With the rise of geotagged users data being available through both mobile applications and social media, it is possible to detect events where multiple users congregate. In the case of social media, additional "timeline" information is available in the form of messages posted by users. Together, these features provide a rich feature space informing us about the preferences of users towards certain events, that can be used to generate recommendations looking forward for upcoming events they might nd interesting.

Several approaches to event recommendation have been explored in the past, using many different data sources. Similarly, many works explore techniques for detecting real-world events on social networks such as Twitter [6, 1, 3]. However, to our knowledge no solution yet exists which rec-ommends events for users based on their Twitter activity. Co rresponding Author
Similarity between two different events is calculated based on event description, user participation and social media in-teraction during and about the event. In addition, to the description from Eventbrite, a bounding box is inferred from geotagged data in tweets discussing the the event. The so-cial media traffic is monitored for prior during and after the duration of the event the combined duration is referred to as event life time. As we do not have access to complete twitter rehose, we use historic event data to predict the interval and the geographic area to subscribe for events on the social network. The event database and the associated tweets is used to create a non-personalized model of events attractiveness to attendees.
Twitter incorporates rich metadata, among which we are going to use two elds. They are geo-location and time associated with tweet posted. These two elds help us in identifying the past events user has visited.

In order to identify if user has been to an event, we look for two aspects. One: if the user appears in the event bound-ing box and the other, does he appear in the bounding box within time bounds of event life time. If both the conditions are satis ed, then we identify him as the visitor to the event. Once the user was Identi ed in the previous/history events, we build the user's previous event activity.
Event recommendation presents a unique challenge be-cause we cannot measure user interaction with the event until it has already occurred. In order to recommend events to users, we use item-based collaborative ltering to recom-mend upcoming events similar to ones previously attended by the user [5]. In this case events are interpreted as items, and the event model from Subsection 2.2 provides item fea-tures. User twitter activity is associated with previous events as described in Subsection 2.3, which we interpret as an im-plicit preference of a user towards that event. Recommenda-tions themselves are performed using the LensKit implemen-tation of Collaborative Filtering, which enables this system to be easily included in other applications and recommen-dation frameworks[2].
