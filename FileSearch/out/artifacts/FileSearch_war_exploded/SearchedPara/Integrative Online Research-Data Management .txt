 In support of our research projects in information retrieval, we have developed an integrated mu lti-process software system that shepherds research data from induction through aggregation, analysis, and presentation. We combine public-domain code libraries with our own software to provide a flexible, easily-configured modular system that exposes data online for easier collaboration. The goal is to create a single online infrastructure that allows colleagues to submit, process, analyze and visualize data, and discuss and prioritize issues through a single integrated interface. We demonstrate our system within the context of the large data set provided by the Indexer X  X  Legacy project [1]. H.5.2 [ Information Interfaces and Presentation ]: User Interfaces  X  evaluation/methodology, prototyping Digital collections, visualization, user interfaces. Given a server that can support common research practices, online research collaboration presents several advantages. Data is stored in a central canonical easily-accessed repository, guaranteed to be the most current available. Ve rsioning, automated backups and redundant storage prevent data lo ss. Tests and processes can be uploaded to the server and run on the data where it is stored, obviating the need to download all and run it on a team member's local machine. Tests and results can be double-checked directly online and confirmed by other members of the research team. If desired, data, processe s, and results can also be shared with the world online, as befitting calls w ithin the research community for easier replicability and an "open data" ethos [2]. Web crawlers, user studies, and surveys are administered directly from the server through a web browser, and the accumulated data is stored directly on the same machine where it will be analyzed, reducing upload time and cost. Data bases that store related meta-data can also be configured and edited through a web browser, and accessed as needed from any process within the server. Discussions of team members can also be centralized and shared: critical issues can be raised, disc ussed, assigned, and prioritized using a text-based issue-tracking module (as for bug-tracking). In our system, we demonstrate an integrative approach that combines all of these abilities in a single, easy-to-use software platform. Such centralization of research data and meta-data helps ensure that all team members are talking about the same thing , and also the right thing .
