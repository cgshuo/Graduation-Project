 1. Introduction
Asia Information Retrieval Symposium (AIRS) was first established in 2004 by the Asian information re-trieval community after the success of the International Workshop on Information Retrieval with Asian Lan-guages (IRAL) series, held in Taejon (1996), Tsukuba (1997), Singapore (1998), Taipei (1999), Hong Kong (2000) and Sapporo (2003). AIRS aims to bring together international researchers and developers to exchange new ideas and latest achievements in the field of information retrieval (IR), especially in Asia. The scope of the symposium covers applications, systems, technologies and theoretical aspects of information retrieval in text, audio, image, video and multi-media data.

The information retrieval research activities in Asia mark a sharp and steady increase not only in the num-ber of submissions to the series of the workshops and symposiums but also in qualities. For example,
AIRS2005 ( Gary Geunbae Lee, Akio Yamada, Helen Meng, &amp; Sung Hyon Myaeng, 2005 ) received 136 sub-missions from all over the world including Asia, North America, Europe, Australia, and Africa, from which only 32 papers (23%) were presented in oral sessions and 36 papers in poster sessions (26%). The low accep-tance rates witness the success and stability of the future information retrieval research activities in Asia.
This special issue contains the best papers carefully selected from AIRS2005, and the selected papers were revised and extended based on the reviews of the world class researchers. While the papers have a broad cov-erage in IR without a specific concentration often associated with a special issue, the fact that they are from a group of researchers in a specific region makes this special issue interesting. They not only represent most sig-nificant IR research in recent years but also reflect the R&amp;D interests in Asia. We hope that this special issue helps the international IR community, including the researchers and developers in Asia, increase awareness of
IR research activities in Asia and stimulates collaborations across different regions. 2. Papers in this issue
Technical areas covered in this special issue of  X  X  X nformation Retrieval Research in Asia X  X  are very diverse including IR theories and models, text mining, web related techniques, multimedia retrieval and experimenta-tion/evaluation issues. The papers are grouped with their corresponding topics as follows. 2.1. IR theories and models: language modeling and document ranking Seung-Hoon Na, In-Su Kang, Ji-Eun Roh, Jong-Hyeok Lee: An Empirical Study of Query Expansion and
Cluster-Based Retrieval in Language Modeling Approach. The term mismatch problem in information retrieval is very critical and has been major hurdles for good IR performance. This paper first performs an empirical study on query expansion using parsimony and cluster-based retrieval in terms of retrieval performance. They found that query expansion is generally more effective than cluster-based retrieval in resolving the word-mis-match problem, and their combinations are more effective when each method significantly improves the base-line performance.

Lingpeng Yang, Donghong Ji, Munkew Leong: Document reranking by term distribution and maximal marginal relevance for Chinese Information Retrieval. This paper proposes a document reranking method based on a specific term weighting scheme, which integrates both local and global distribution of terms as well as document frequency, document positions and term length. The new weighting scheme was used to replace the idf scheme in MMR (maximal marginal relevance), and was shown to outperform relevant methods consistently by evaluation on the NTCIR-3 Chinese document collection. 2.2. Text mining issues: classification, clustering, question answering, topic detection and tracking
June-Jei Kuo and Hsin-Hsi Chen: Cross Document Event Clustering Using Knowledge Mining from Co-Ref-erence Chains. Topic detection and tracking must handle the co-reference relations between the entities across several documents. This paper proposes a metric of normalized-chain edit-distance to mine the controlled vocabularies from cross-document co-reference chains, and suggests a novel threshold model to use the con-trolled vocabularies for event clustering.

Francois Paradis, Jian-Yun Nie: Contextual Feature Selection for Text Classification. This paper presents a simple approach for the classification of  X  X  X oisy X  X  documents using bigrams and named entities. The approach combines conventional feature selection with a contextual approach to filter out passages around selected features.
 Kyoung-Soo Han, Young-In Song, Sang-Bum Kim, and Hae-Chang Rim : Answer Extraction and Ranking
Strategies for Definitional Question Answering Using Linguistic Features and Definition Terminology . Defini-tional questions refer to the defining questions such as  X  X  X hat are fractals? X  X  and have several different char-acteristics from the factoid questions. This paper proposes answer extraction and ranking strategies for definitional question answering using linguistic features and definition terminology. This paper uses several diverse techniques to overcome the limitations of the error-prone NLP techniques such as simple anaphora resolution, syntactic patterns, and definitional terminology to generate more effective answers.
Yun Jin, Sung Hyon Myaeng, Yuchul Jung: Use of Place Information for Improved Event Tracking. Even though topic detection and tracking (TDT) can benefit from an explicit use of time and place information, the place information has been rarely used unlike the time information. This paper focused on the place infor-mation for more effective TDT tasks. News articles were analyzed for their characteristics of place informa-tion, and a new topic tracking method was proposed to incorporate the analysis results.

Akinori Fujino, Naonori Ueda, Kazumi Saito: A hybrid generative/discriminative approach to text classifica-tion with additional information. Web pages and technical papers consist of many additional components such as titles, links, and authors besides main text, and this paper presents a hybrid text classifier based on prob-abilistic generative and discriminative approaches. The formulation considers individual component genera-tive models and constructs a classifier by combining these individual trained models based on the maximum entropy principle.

Yongwook Yoon, Gary Geunbae Lee: Efficient Implementation of Associative Classifiers for Document Clas-sification. Associative classifiers have many favorable characteristics such as rapid training, good classification accuracy, and excellent interpretation ability, but have been rarely used for text classification tasks. This paper applies the associative classification techniques to document classification problem, and proposes a feature selection method based on dimensionality reduction and a new efficient method for storing and pruning the rules to handle the huge amount of classification rules. 2.3. Web related issues: web mining, web search engine and FAQ retrieval Kui-Lam Kwok, Laszlo Grunfeld, Peter Deng: Employing Web Mining and Data Fusion to Improve Weak Ad
Hoc Retrieval. Improving the weak query and retrieval effectiveness is an important issue for ad-hoc retrieval and this paper proposes a data fusion of sufficiently dissimilar retrieval lists to improve the weak query results.
To realize sufficiently dissimilar retrieval lists, this paper proposes composing alternate queries through web search and mining, employing them for target retrieval, and combining with the original query retrieval list.
Harksoo Kim, Hyunjung Lee, and Jungyun Seo: A Reliable FAQ Retrieval System Using a Query Log Clas-sification Technique Based on Latent Semantic Analysis. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) is a very valuable resource for customer relation management, but conventional IR techniques such as OKAPI BM25 model has some difficulties in FAQ retrieval due to the high rate of lexical overlapping in short documents. This paper describes a high performance FAQ retrieval system only using users X  query logs without high-level knowledge bases or handcrafted rules through the techniques of clustering based on latent semantic analysis.
Wei Lu, Min-Yen Kan: Supervised Categorization of JavaScript using Program Analysis Features. Dynamic web pages such as Java Script, Macromedia Flash, and AJAX are great challenges for most IR systems because the web crawlers cannot efficiently index these pages. But understanding embedded scripts and their purpose can often help to interpret or provide crucial information about the web page. This paper developed a functionality based categorization of JavaScript by viewing the understanding embedded scripts as a text categorization problem.

Tao Qin, Tie-Yan Liu, Xu-Dong Zhang, Guang Feng, De-Sheng Wang, and Wei-Ying Ma: Topic Distillation via Subsite Retrieval. Topic distillation refers to the search scenario of distilling a small number of high-quality entry pages that are best representatives of a given broad topic. This paper proposes a novel concept for topic distillation, named sub-site retrieval, in which the basic searching unit is a sub-site instead of single page, and proposes punished Integration algorithm and better user interface to illustrate the search results of sub-site retrieval. 2.4. Multimedia retrieval: image, video, audio, metadata and music recommendation Tzu-Chuen Lu, Chin-Chen Chang: Color Image Retrieval Technique based on Color Features and Image
Bitmap. The content-based image retrieval (CBIR) techniques have been investigated to solve the problems of the annotation-based image retrieval. This paper uses the color distributions, the mean value and the stan-dard deviation to represent the global characteristics of the image as well as the image bitmap to represent the local characteristics of the image for increasing the accuracy of the retrieval system.
 Qing Li, Sung Hyon Myaeng, Byeong Man Kim: A Probabilistic Music Recommender Considering User
Opinions and Audio Features. This paper proposes a Collaborative Music Recommender System based on item-based probabilistic model, where items are classified into groups and predictions are made for users con-sidering the Gaussian distribution of user ratings. This paper extends the original model by utilizing audio features that help alleviate user bias, non-association, and cold start problems in capturing accurate similar-ities among items.
 Wen-Cheng Lin, Yih-Chen Chang and Hsin-Hsi Chen: Integrating Textual and Visual Information for Cross-
Language Image Retrieval: A Trans-Media Dictionary Approach. Integrating textual and visual information is essential for multi-media information retrieval and this paper explores this important issue especially for cross-language image retrieval task. Cross-language image retrieval is organized as one of the evaluation task in
Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) where the task has to consider the language translation in addi-tion to the media translation. The authors use an automatic transformation approach from textual queries into visual representation by mining the relationship between text and images. The proposed method improves the retrieval performance for both English monolingual and Chinese-English cross-language retrieval experiments.
 Seungji Yang, Sang Kyun Kim, Kyong Sok Seo, Yong Man Ro, Ji-Yeon Kim, Yang Suk Seo: Semantic
Categorization of Digital Home Photo Using Photographic Region Templates. The semantic categorization of image has been a challenge due to the proliferation of digital home photos. This paper proposes a method to detect semantically meaningful concepts contained in a photo by incorporating an intermediate level of concepts, called local concept, to bridge the semantic gap of the low-level features and high-level category concepts. The proposed method was demonstrated with 3828 general home photos from MPEG-7 Visual Core Experiment 2 data set.

Jean-Pierre Chevallet, Joo-Hwee Lim, and Mun-Kew Leong: Object Identification and Retrieval from Effi-cient Image Matching Snap2Tell with the STOIC dataset. Traditional content-based image retrieval attempts to retrieve images using low-level syntactic features for a query image. This paper, on the contrary, studied the task of using the content of an image such as object identification to retrieve information in general. The paper applies this technique to Singapore Tourist Object Identification Collection (STOIC) with associated queries and relevance judgments for evaluating the new task and the need for efficient image matching using simple image features. 2.5. Experimentation: test collection and evaluation methodology
Tetsuya Sakai: On the Reliability of Information Retrieval Metrics based on Graded Relevance. This paper compares several information retrieval metrics based on graded relevance, as well as on binary relevance, in terms of stability, sensitivity and resemblance of system rankings. More specifically, this paper compares these metrics using the Buckley/Voorhees stability method, the Voorhees/Buckley swap method and Kendall X  X  rank correlation, with three data sets comprising test collections from NTCIR. The experiments show that Normal-ized Discounted Cumulative Gain at document cut-off l is the best among the rank-based graded-relevance metrics, provided that l is large. 3. Conclusion
The papers included in this special issue by no means represent all the recent activities of IR in Asia, given that they have been extended from those selected papers presented at AIRS2005 held in Jeju Island, Korea.
High-quality papers originated from Asian countries or co-authored with the researchers in the region have also appeared in major conferences like ACM SIGIR. However, AIRS has become a major forum for Asian researchers with its own unique atmosphere and culture. Although all the presentations and discussions were conducted in English and not limited to the issues related to Asian languages, the conference was a comfort-able place for sharing information and knowledge because of the common cultural background including varying degrees of understanding the major Asian languages. We are certain that the readers will not only appreciate the quality of the papers, despite their regional orientation, but also enhance their understanding of the research problems and solutions in Asian countries so that further collaborations can begin. We hope that interested readers will plan to attend upcoming AIRS conferences including the one to be held in Singa-pore in 2006.
