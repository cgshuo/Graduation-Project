The second point is that many duos lead to the same Lorenz similarity curve. We will hence consider which are reflections with respect to the line x =1/2. The duos {r {r alent duos will be given when the notion of replication invariance is introduced.

Considerations related to smallest and largest similarity The equality line connecting the origin O =(0,0) with the point E =(1,0) is situated under all other to N 1 different (but pairwise equivalent) and intersecting curves. Consequently there is no minimum intrinsic similarity curve, even when N is fixed (unless N =2), and certainly not for variable N .
The following theorem shows that Lorenz similarity curves behave as one expects for a notion that is supposed to reflect similarity.

Theorem. The Gini similarity measure for absence  X  presence data is equal to the Jaccard index, J. and one trapezoid. Using Eqs. (5) and (6) this area is equal to: Consequently, the Gini similarity measure is the overlap measures O 1 and O 2 ( Egghe &amp; Michel, 2002 ).
 Theorem. The overlap measures O 2  X  c r and O 1  X  c q are weak Lorenz similarity measures. The proof of this theorem is based on the following lemma.

If ordinate( S 0 ) is not equal to ordinate( S ), then ordinate( S hence O 0 1 &gt; O 1 . So, in general we can only say that D measure O 1 is a weak Lorenz similarity measure. 6. The relation between retrieval and overlap measures, and Lorenz similarity value do not co-occur for O 1 and O 2 .

Corollary. Any average of the overlap measures O 1 and O measure.

Taking the harmonic mean leads to the well-known Dice coefficient. Indeed, the harmonic mean of O and O 2 is in common.

The geometric mean of O 1 and O 2 is Salton X  X  cosine measure ures O 1 and O 2 , but they are all weak similarity measures in our sense. Another example of an acceptable similarity measure is squared coefficient of variation, hence the notation V 2 S in an information retrieval setting it can be interpreted as the number of unique keywords (keywords that are either unique to r or unique to s ) divided by the product of the number of keywords in r and the number of keywords in s . In this form the adapted Simpson index has the drawback that if r = s the similarity value becomes + 1 . The similarity of minimal Lorenz curves tends to zero as N increases.

 Appendix A In this appendix we provide a number of technical proofs.
 Proposition
Recall that L r , s and L r 0 , s 0 are drawn with the sub-top before the top. Their co-ordinates are The proof is divided into several steps.
 Step 1 . Abscissa( S 0 ) 6 abscissa( S ) equal to the absolute value of the slope of S 00 E . This means that As q 6 r and q 0 6 r 0 we conclude that
If r = c then c = q = r and L r , s is the equality line, which is in contradiction with L case cannot occur. The case c 0 = q 0 will be studied in step 5 of the proof.
Now, abscissa( S 0 ) 6 abscissa( S ) holds if: The last inequality is true by (A.1) . This proves this first step. Step 2 . The slope of the line OS 0 is smaller than or equal to the slope of OS . The slope of the line OS 0 is equal to N 0 q 0 , while the slope of OS is from (A.1) .
 Steps 1 and 2 put together show that the point S 0 is situated below or on the line segment OS . Step 3 . The abscissa of T 0 is larger than or equal to the abscissa of T . We have to show that: q 0 N 0 P q N . This follows immediately from (A.1) . Step 4 . The absolute value of the slope of T 0 E is smaller than or equal to the slope of TE .
We have to prove that: r follows from (A.1) . We already noticed that the case r = c cannot occur. Steps 3 and 4 together show that T 0 is situated under or on the line segment TE .
This proves that in general L 0 is situated strictly under L (note that it is impossible that S = S Step 5. Exceptions
We now have a look at the exceptional cases. If q 0 = c 0 proposition holds (unless may be if r 0 = c 0 ). Yet, if r inequality of the proposition holds strictly. This ends the proof of this proposition. that the corresponding keyword is present, strictly increases similarity. times the value (( j r j +1) 1 ( j s j +1) 1 ), and ( j s j c ) times the value ( j s j +1) matically) represents the transformation. This is: we will show that the curve O  X  S the curve O X  X  X  X   X  E .
 The co-ordinates of point S are q c tion (i.e. adding ones to each array) we obtain the following points: S situated below the line OS . Further, the abscissa of T 0 and we are dealing with the equality line, a case that has been excluded.
Lemma. If sub-top precedes top then the following two statements are true: (c) If the tops of two Lorenz similarity curves coincide then their sub-tops also coincide. Proof. Clearly
We first show that if the tops coincide, this is then also the sub-tops coincide. For this to hold we have to show that From equality (*) we see that q (right-hand side, if c 0  X  0) yields coincide. Finally, the ordinate of T =1.As T = T 0 this implies that c 0 =0, and hence also S
Similarly, if c 0 =0, then from T 0 = T , we see that c =0 too, and thus S = T .If r = c and r c 6 q 6 r , and c 0 6 q 0 6 r 0 we conclude that r = q = c and r curve in both cases.

If the sub-tops coincide, this is then, in order to prove that also the tops coincide, we again have to show that Now from the equality q c if c 0  X  0) yields and hence, again by (**) : r
We will now consider the exceptional cases. If c =0, then S = T and the ordinate of T =1.As S = S implies that c 0 =0, and hence also S 0 = T 0 and the two curves coincide. Similarly, if c c =0 and thus S = T .If q = c , then S = O , hence also S
T and T 0 are different. An example of this situation is D = {r =(1,1,1,0), s =(1,1,1,1)} and D {r 0 =(1,1,0,0), s 0 =(1,1,1,1)}. Here S = S 0 = O , but T =(3/4,1/4), while T This proves the lemma. h References
