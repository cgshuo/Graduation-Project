 Web 2.0 presents an online forum for people to express opinions on products. These sentiments in reviews. Some work exists in the area of exploring the influence of sentiment in prediction. volumes to predict spikes in sales, while Gruhl et al. [5] and Liu et al. [6] demonstrat-sales prediction than volume only. In this paper, we focus on the mining of sentiments significance of this work lies in pricing, marketing scheme, and so on. 
Taking book reviews as a case study, we considered ways to predict sales volume through the sentiment information obtained from reviews. We examine book reviews, because special marketing strategies rarely drive sales of books as compared to other categories. plentiful, but conventional text mining methods, such as the classification of reviews, do not apply to this new area. Overall, the goal of our opinion mining is to generate a opinions are presented in two main patterns: explicit expressions and implicit expres-sions. We apply the sentiment-language model and sentiment-LDA to capture the two types of sentiments, and propose a Latent Sentiment Language (LSL) model. As op-than on all words. Therefore, we first cons truct a sentiment word lexicon in our study. In LSL, the sentiment words compose the feature vectors of reviews, and help extract the subjective nature of the comments. 1970, which is widely used in many time series prediction problems, including stock prices [8] and box office [6]. Integrating sentiment information and AR, we generate the Sentiment Autoregressive (SAR) model. Abundant experiments conducted on the AR model, which also prove the predictive power of sentiments. 
In summary, we make the following contributions. First, we propose the probabil-model and sentiment-LDA. Second, considering the influence of sentiments and past sales performance together, we present the SAR model for product sales prediction. discusses ways to mine the sentiment using the probabilistic LSL model. In Section 5, we propose the SAR model to predict sales. Section 6 shows the results of the expe-riments. We conclude the paper in Section 7. 2.1 Polarity Word Lexicon Polarity words reflect the basic ideas of the public toward products. Most prior senti-ment analysis works start with the extraction of these words. Wiebe [9] tried to collect Hatzivassiloglou et al. [10] gathered sets of semantically oriented adjectives, gradable Turney [11] measured the semantic orientation of a word by the difference of mutual al. [13] judged the polarity of new words through a list of seed adjectives. 
These methods are available and practicable. However, employing methods like [9, though methods like [11, 12, 13] do not have the above limitation, the results depend on the seed set to some extent. Given these limits, we first adopt the affective lexicon ontology constructed by Xu et al. [14], and then apply the double-channel technique in [15] to extract sentiment words automatically. 2.2 Sentiment Mining Recently, there is heavy use of review data for polarity analysis and opinion mining. One of the early algorithms employed an unsupervised learning method for sentiment classification [11]. And Pang [16] examined three machine learning algorithms (Na X ve Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machines) for classifying reviews as positive or negative. 
Shifting from classification to rating, Pang et al. [17] presented the rating-inference problem, which measures the strength of the sentiment by a rating score (i.e., one to different rating scales. 
Pushing further along the sentiment mining line, Popescu [19] built an unsuper-vised information extraction system to derive the features of products and the evalua-framework to analyze consumer opinions of competing products. sentative quantized values of sentiments that can reflect economic worth, rather than ment Language model to measure the relationship between sentiments and reviews. 2.3 Autoregressive Model Box et al. [7] proposed the autoregressive (AR) model in 1970. It is a type of random process of time series, which provides a new way to solve the prediction problem, and areas such as stocks [8] and box office [6]. x the past p days of sales x t -1 , x t -2 , ..., x t -p . Here we choose the e-commerce platform Taobao 1 as the data source due to its open policy of both the reviews and sales data. Here, we write a crawler to get reviews and data collection. between two random words; in other words, Chinese word segmentation is necessary. Here we use the ICTCLAS tool 2 , a popular Chinese auto-segmentation system. After 6381 reviews length (number of words). 
As Table 1 shows, the majority of reviews (96%) fall within a length range of 1 to mining and analysis of sentiment words could be very important. 4.1 Sentiment Lexicon sentiment lexicon. coverage of these terms, we first adopt the affective lexicon ontology constructed by idioms and network terminologies. 
Observing that people often express opinions using words located around the prod-words and features. Thus, we can obtain these words automatically from the corpora are any nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs nearby the feature, we extract words that may express opinions. Finally, a list with 1428 terms is generated. Based on the ma-which totaled about 13,670. 4.2 Latent Sentiment Language Model usually come in multi-aspects. Therefore, merely classifying the reviews cannot pro-prediction, mining sentiments from reviews presents unique challenges, and requires a new method of analysis. 
To this end, we propose a probabilistic model called Latent Sentiment Language by the sentiment-language model and sentiment-LDA. A language model representa-tion of a review can  X  X enerate X  new text by sampling words according to probability tion is that the language model is an approximate representation of what the customer had in mind when he/she wrote the review. When we focus primarily on the sentiment words in a review, the language model also gradually becomes a sentiment carrier of a reviewer. Therefore, the sentiment-langua ge model provides a principled way to quantify the sentiment words associated with natural language. When mining implicit sentiments, sentiment-LDA allows us to adjust the complicated nature of sentiments, wherein reviews reveal a mixture of latent aspects of sentiments. Thus we can model the relationship among these aspects, reviews, and words under a probabilistic framework. Different from the traditional LDA, sentiment-LDA replaces the topics by sentiments. We begin the presentation of LSL by first introducing the sentiment-language model and sentiment-LDA. w , ..., w M } be a set of sentiment words from our sentiment lexicon. The description from a language model by randomly pulling sentiment words out of the words  X  X uck-et X  W , and representing each row (review) in D as a BOW vector. In other words, the sentiment word generation as follows: implies negative, 0 implies positive, and p ( w j | r i ) is defined as: A widely used method to perform the smoothing, called Dirichlet [21, 22], is applied and R t respectively. 
Once the parameter for the sentiment-language model is selected, we can finish mining sentiments expressed directly in a review. As discussed above, it is not the end of our work. Due to the complex of natural language, semantic analysis techniques are needed in further mining. 
To this end, we model the multifaceted sentiment with sentiment-LDA, in which a for generating a review is: with parameter  X  . 2. For each word position in review r i :  X  Pick a sentiment aspect z  X  Choose a word w reviews: Parameters  X  and  X  are corpus-related, assumed to be sampled once in the process of word in each document. distribution. 
By modifying the probability of sentiment words generated from a sentiment-language model using p lda ( w j | r i ), we get the following function [22]: which in turn leads to the results of sentiment analysis: the next section, it can be used to predict future book sales. 5.1 The Autoregressive Model follows: noise). achieved by a logarithmic method, in which y t = log x t . Then, we apply the standard Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test in Econometrics on { y t } to verify the stationary. After these steps, we get the final time series { y t }: Wherein, parameters  X  i ( i =1, ... , p ) can be learned from the training data. 5.2 Incorporating Sentiments The definition of aggregate sentiments on reviews in R t is 96 X. Li et al. formulated as follows: the sentiment information from how many days are considered, others are introduced in Section 4. 5.3 Training the SAR Model Without known parameters, a model cannot be complete. Training the SAR model in our work, we choose ordinary least squares (OLS) to complete the estimation. gression model. This method minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances be-tween the observed responses in the dataset and the responses predicted by the linear approximation. A simple formula can express the resulting estimator especially in the case of a single regressor on the right hand side. After the estimation, the SAR model can adhere to the parameter values. 6.1 Experiment Settings The data we use in the experiments consist of a set of 6748 reviews of 22 books, and the corresponding 742 days of sales data. The following is the overall process of the experiments. training, and the other 117 days for testing. derive from training a SAR model. Here, we conduct the experiments from p = 1 to p = 6. 
LSL model. 4. Feeding the results of sentiment analysis obtained in step 3, along with the sales of the preceding days, into the SAR model, an d evaluating the prediction performance of the SAR model by experimenting with the testing data set. Without loss of generality, we use the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) [22] to measure the prediction accuracy, which is standard in regression analysis: Where N is the total number of predictions made on the testing data, True i represents the true sale, and Pred i is the predicted sale. 6.2 Parameter Selection In the SAR model, several user-chosen parameters provide the flexibility to fine tune pects K , Dirichlet smoothing parameter u , the time orders of the SAR model p , senti-tion performance. ances the influences of past sales performance and the sentiments in reviews. When  X  basic AR model; when  X  equals 0.0, the SAR model only considers the sentiments in reviews, and the value of MAPE is the same and independent of p . As shown in Fig. 1, with the variation of  X  from 0.05 to 0.95, the prediction accuracy of SAR can reach better results than AR (  X  = 1.0) even though the parameter p is different, and the SAR 98 X. Li et al. achieves its optimal performance at  X  = 0.65 when p = 1. It indicates that the integrat-ing of sentiments can indeed lead to more accurate prediction, which helps prove the MAPE at  X  = 0 also indicates that only sentiment itself can be a good indicator of the book sales, and its performance is much better than AR model when p = 2, 3, 6, and almost achieves the same level when p = 4, 5. achieves its best prediction accuracy when p = 1. This suggests that prediction closely of the AR model, the trends of MAPE stays stable with varying  X  , which reflects the importance of AR in SAR model. mation captured from reviews posted on the same day and the immediately preceding two days. into a sentiment-language model when  X  = 1; when  X  = 0, LSL turns into a sentiment-LDA model. Since we consider both weights of the two parts and the value of  X  does LSL. Fig. 4 also shows that sentiment-language model performs better than senti-ments more directly, and, in future work, more effort should be put into explicit sen-timent analysis. MAPE. As K increases from 1 to 7 in Fig. 5, the prediction accuracy first deteriorates and then improves, and SAR achieves its best performance when K = 1. The explana-described with lower dimensional probability vectors is enough. Also, the total num-ber of parameters which must be estimated in the sentiment-LDA grows linearly with high training costs in terms of space and time. 
Parameter u is a factor in Dirichlet smoothing. We vary its value to observe its in-more important role than the number of sentiment terms in a review set of one day. 6.3 Comparison with Alternative Sentiment Mining Methods To verify that the sentiment information captured by the LSL model plays an impor-mining methods and the basic AR model without the consideration for the sentiment information. 
We first conduct experiments to compare SAR against the pure autoregressive model in formula (7). The results are in Fig. 7. We observe the behaviors of the two model with increasing p . 
We then compare SAR with an autoregressive model that integrates with the lan-guage model or the LDA model respective to mining sentiments in prediction. Using these two models and compare them with SAR. The results are in Fig. 7. Although the model still dominates performance. 100 X.

In this paper, we identify the task in the ongoing research in sentiment analysis, exploring the predictive power of plicit and the implicit aspect.

Our empirical experiments on a book dataset confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. 
For future work, there are many interesting research directions to explore. For ex-we can explore the differences of their influence degree. In a slightly different twist, there is also much work to consider the reverse effect on how opinions and sentiments will be influenced by the changes in the associated economic variables, such as price, stock, etc. Acknowledgment.
