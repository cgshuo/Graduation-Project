University of Pardubice, Faculty of Economics and Administration, Pardubice, Czech Republic Abstract Universities have since t ime immemorial contributed to their economies by way of research and quality education, but in recent times their role is changing since they accepted their third mission of contributing to d evelopment (social and economic ) and direct engagement in the economy by collaborating with industries and government to create innovation . A crucial point in the flow of academic research results to the ent repreneurial stage is the transfer of knowledge emanating from tertiary educational in stitutions to the economy. A cademic spin offs play an increasingly important role in this regard . Spin -offs firms transfer ne w research outcomes into directly commercial worth . Academic entrepreneurship has been embraced the world over due to the contribut ion s it can make by w ay of reducing unemployment, boosting up economic growth and impacting significantly to the knowledge -based of the economy . The main aim of this paper is to assess the entrepreneurial activities of universities in the Czech Republic to see how they engage with industries by way of spin -off creation and technology transf er . This paper has been able to demonstrate that the concept of universities engaging in entrepreneurial activities is novel among univ ersiti es in the Czech Republic . The results of this paper have shown that u niversities in the Czech Republic have less engagement with indu stries . The paper has also shown that, spin -off firms in the Czech Rep ublic a re in not evenly distributed nationally, but they are mostly located in Brno .
 Keywords: Entrepreneur universities, spin -offs, Czech Republic, economy , knowledge transfer , knowledge -base .
 Introduction Universities are undoubtedly important when it comes to human resources development and economic growth of countries. Universities are in recent times highly looked up to make meaningful contribution or returns to communities and countries where they are located (Dahlstrand, 2008) . Entrepreneu rial universities have become vital player in the knowledge -based economy , and are also an important co mponent in the Triple Helix collaboration. Entrepreneurial universities play a leading role in innovation as well as socio -economic development (Etzkowitz, 2008). The traditional missions of universities have been to educate the crop of researchers, but in recent times universities have widely accepted a third mis sion which is to contribute directly to the socioeconomic development of the society in their catchment area (Mets, 2010). Some of the possible ways universities are expected to contribute to social or regional developme nt have conventionally being through the research publications, human resource development and their traditional role of teaching . Recently universities have in tandem knitted their traditional and their new third mission and this has placed lots of challenges on university and their entre preneurial activities (Van Dierdonck and Debackere, 1988; Lerner, 2004). There is an increasing demand for universities to transfer the knowledge generated further than their academic community to reach other users like industries (Mansfield and Lee, 1996; Branscomb et al., 1999; Hague and Oakley, 2000). Most universities in recent times are trying to adjust and position themselves better to embrace their regional development role, so they are in a transition stage i.e. changing from their traditional role to a new role of direct engagement with other social actors like existing industries or helping in the establishment of new firms. It is only when universities are able to contribute and get involved in the transfer of technology and firm formation that th ey can be labeled  X  X ully fledged X  ( Etzkowitz, 2003). The paradigm shift from universities traditional research focus to an entrepreneurial university has the impetus to contribute to regional development significantly ( Etzkowitz, 2013) . Through the new entrepreneurial role of universities they can help to train the needed manpower base of the country, contribute to the technology infrastructure and help find solutions to societal problems. Well established entrepreneur universities are th ose that are actively involved in the commercialisation of their academic research through various ways such as product development , establishing academic spin -offs, and patents acquisition. It can also manife st itself by way of academics consulting activi ties and signing research contracts with firms (Goldfarb and Henrekson, 2003). The success or otherwise of entrepreneur ial universities are mostly measured according to the total number of spin -offs they establish and patents licensed ( Etzkowitz, 2003; Dah lstrand, 2008). Many universities have buttressed their entrepreneur drive by setting up specialized supporting structures such as technology transfer offices (TTOs), incubators and science parks within or in close proximity to their campuses (Siegel et al , 2003; Clarysse et al., 2005).
 Although the Czech government has made enormous contribution towards higher education in terms of budgetary allocations and infrastructure support, little is known about entrepreneur initiatives of Czech universities and their research commercialization by way of spin off creation. The multitude of literature reviewed has demonstrated that the concept of entrepreneur universities and their activities of spin of creation is a novel development in the Czech Republic . It is based on this fact that this paper has proposed a model pathway of entrepreneurial universities in the United Kingdom. UK universities have longed engaged with industries and are one of the success stories in Europe. The UK is home to nume rous spin off firms through the initiatives of its growing entrepreneurial universities ( Lockett and Wright, 2005). This paper therefore seeks to bring to bear the successful factors promoting entrepreneurial universities in the UK that can be emulated by universities in the Czech Republic, where the concept of entrepreneurial universities is gaining popularity but still in its early stages.
 The rest of this paper is organized in the following way. In the next section, I will focus on the theoretical backg round presented on the commercialization of academic activities and spin offs development. Section 3 elaborates on the research methodology, discussion, and the characteristics of the data for the research. Section 4 elaborates on the conclusion and offers some suggestions for future research directions.
 Theoretical background Universities have been known to perform the tasks of teaching and research but in recent times they also perform certain roles such as collaborating and establishing closer links with business and industry ( Slaughter &amp; Leslie, 1997; Rupika &amp; Singh, 2016). Universiti es play key role in the knowled ge economy, they provide the needed infrastructure that helps to build social capacities essential for natio ns and regions to thrive in the knowledge based economy (Florida &amp; Cohen, 1999) . This expectation from universities has now led them to be academic entrepreneurs . The entrepreneurial university is becoming a vital development in the academic sphere because it has metamorphosed the focus of universities from teaching and researching to forming academic enterprise and knowledge and technology transfer (Etzkowitz, 2003) . This transforming in the role of universities or the  X  second academic revolution  X  has inco rporated a new mission has positioned the entrepreneurial university to contribute to the economic and social development (Etzkowitz, 2004). Traditional universities have in recent times moved a step further beyond spawning profit oriented or commercial knowledge and contributing to training new crop of qualified research scientists. Universities are nowadays helping contribute to produce other means of knowledge transmission. They do contribute to such knowledge diffusion by training and attracting skill ed and talented potentials to the local economy within their catchment areas or nationwide. Importantly, and the recent form of expectations of modern universities is seen in the way they are to collaborate with industry , they mostly collaborate with industries by assisting and providing industries with formal and informal manpower and technical support ( Bramwell, &amp; Wolfe, 2008) As universities take up entr epreneurial roles, they flake and break the long established image of ivory tower and now pay at tention to the creation and dissemination of essential knowledge across a wider coverage network in the socio -economic structure ( Saad &amp; Zawdie, 2011). This means that the industrial sector stand to gain because they benefit by way of utilizing knowledge p roduced by universities to generate wealth. The entrepreneur universities  X  role is therefore to put the knowledge they generate from their diverse research into commercial output that and they mostly do this by spin off firm formation (Etzkowitz, 2003 ). S pin -offs from universities and other Higher Education Institutions (HEI) constitute the well -known mode of knowledge transfer. The results of research and academic knowledge are vital resources in start -ups, it is in spin offs that knowledge can be changed into wealth and marketable . For universities to be considered to attain the status of been referred to as an entrepreneur , it needs to have a high degree of autonomy and should not be heavily dependent on government and industries ( Etzkowitz, 2003). Ind ependence of universities will make room for them to focus on their research oriented and social development mission. This academic independence means that, universities must not overly or heavily dependent on government as well as industries. They (universities) should be able to take any initiative they deem important and be of importance to students and the national economy. The academic autonomy being described here does not mean they should revisit their academic empire status, but instead , they need to forge a high sense of mutual collaboration with the other social entities (government and industries) .
 Research commercialization is the hallmark of entrepreneur universities. There has not been a universal agreemen t among academia about w hat constitute academic commercialization or entrepreneur universities ( Zhao &amp; Reisman, 1992; Pattnaik &amp; Pandey, 2014) . This lack of consensus is portrayed in the different ways authors prefer name the concept. For instance some authors refer to it as  X  X ca demic engagement X  ( Cohen et al., 2002; Singh et al, 2002; Furrer &amp; Skinner, 2003), and  X  X ntrepreneurial university  X  ( Etzkowitz, 1998, 2003 ). Accordin g to Zhao (2004) research commercialization can be defined as the process by which research findings or any idea emanating from the academic world (universities and higher educational institutions) can be transformed to commercial outputs in the form of go ods and services that to generate wealth. Entrepreneur universities or in simple terms academic engagement denotes the process whereby academic knowledge is passed on and made available for use in the industrial sphere; industries value their engagement wi th academia than licensing university patents (Cohen et al., 2002). Similarly, in the view of Rahal (2005) university commercialization is the process whereby academic research discoveries are transferred from universities to industry in the form of useful services, products and practical applications. It is worth noting that at this point that, one of the ways to assess how entrepreneur universities are performing o r how best they have performed is through the number of spin off that have been able to establish or how far they are engaged with industries either directly or indirectly. Entrepreneur universities therefore use spin -offs compani es to commercialize research. In the view of Klofsten an d Jones -Evans (2000) a  X  X pin off is a new firm or organization established to exploit the results of university research X  (p. 300). Alternatively, Zhang (2009) have also defined a university spin -off firm as companies initiated by university staff which he described as  X  academic entrepreneurs  X  . Conti et al. (2011) also defined a spin -off company as  X  X hose companies that germinate from a University, where a group of researchers compose the entrepreneurial unit aiming at the exploitation of skills and results from the research developed within the University X . So spin offs are new firms established by an academia to transform new ly generated knowledge from universities and other public research organizations into market products that can generate new value add ed and offer employment opportunities . These s pin -off firms transform scientific research knowledge in to commercial use .
 How entrepreneur universities create spin -off firms The commercialization of academic activities in the form of spin off creation involves some stages but they have not been a general consensus in the academic world about the precise process that leads to the creation of spin offs. The process of spin off company creation or development involves some stages or  X  X ife cycle process X  t he path or model that can be followed relative to the scholar and his opinion, for instance the model proposed by Shane (2004)consist of five stages whilst (N donzuau et al, 2002; Pattnaik &amp; Pandey, 2014) proposed a model that consists of four stages. Others such as (Gartner, 1985; Ndonzua u et al, 2002; Helm &amp; Maur oner, 2007 ) came up of a model that consisted of three stages. This paper will adopt the multistage holistic conceptual model that was designed by ( Pattnaik &amp; Pandey, 2014) based on the way it has been simplified making it easy to follow and understand. They classified the stages for spin off creation into four stages. The first stage involved in the cr eation of spin off involves the capabilities which are the prerequisite for any research to be carried out. After the competence has been made known, then competence can be recognized. It is through competence that one will be able to know the resources in the form of capital (finance). At this stage, the research can be financed either individually, by the university or by public sources as illustrated in their diagram below. Figure 1: A multistage holistic model for creating university spinoffs Adapted from Pattnaik, P. N., &amp; Pandey, S. C. (2014).
 The stage two of the model is centered on the kind of research that is conducted and this can either be pure or applied and the results should be tried and must be confirmed to be viable reliable and valid. This forms the basis for understanding the commercial capability of the anticipated spinoff and the potential should also be evaluated and outlined in this stage. The stage three involves of the outcomes of the research. If the researc h is a corporate -funded research, then patents discovery is not possible and if it is deemed possible then it must be specified in the terms and conditions of employment. Understanding the funding makeup is vital because is the decisive factor that can end up in spinoff establishment. The final stage of the model is stage 4. This can be classified as the most important stage in the spin off firm formation process. It is at this stage that, the outcome of all the processes mentioned above becomes a reality. At this stage if all the institutional and legal arrangements are fulfilled from the previous stages and have worked out well , then the social and economic worth is established and it X  X  manifested in the university spinoffs which consist of the commercial or the financial benefit that accr ues to the academic inventor or the university or both depending on whether the university has the control of equity based on employment. Data and methodology of the study Since the concept of entrepreneur universities and their spin offs are a novel concept in the Czech Republic, there is no database for spin off fi rms created by the few entrepreneur universities in the Czech Republic. Based on these facts, this study got its data by relying on the database of the well -known spin off firms and the universities that assisted in their creation. I first combed through all the websites of all universities in the Czech Republic to find out if they have been involved in any form of spin off formation. These data were then compiled for this study. This same approach was used by Kvapilov X  (2016) in her study on Spin -off companies in the Czech Republic . The study then applied the cluster analysis to help get a better understanding of the location of spin offs in the Czech Republic and the entrepreneur universities that established those spin offs . According to (Romesburg, 2004), cluster analysis refers to combinations of mathematical models that can be utilized to group objects that are similar into the same group. All objects have their attributes which might not be the same, but when has many objects, there is bound to be different re search method if the aim of the research is to classify objects based on their similarity. Clusters analysis strongly focuses on the all the linkages and interactions that exist among various actors and people that results in the efficient creation of inn ovation, new products and services (Roelandt &amp; Den Hertog, 1999). The cluster in reference here is not assumed to be the same as happens in other forms of interaction they are very similar and linked in the value chain. Clusters can either be horizontal or vertical (cross -sectorial) network that consist of industries that are not the same but complementary firms that have a specific specialization that can result in the creation of innovation (Morgan, 1997). The cluster analysis approach differs from other conventional research approaches because it takes into account collaborations and knowledge flow within the network (Rouvinen &amp; Yla -Antilla, 1999).
 Analysis and discussion The analysis of data generated from the all the universities in the Czech Republic has demonstrated that universities are engaging and collaborating with industries . The success or otherwise of these entrepreneur universities were assessed based on how successful they have been in establishing a spin -off companies that utilizes their knowledge or the research generated from the university campuses and also how they are able to transfer technology and make available for these academic industries to transform into a wealth and consumer satisfaction. In all these paper has demonstrated that twelve (12) universities in the Czech Republic can be classified as  X  X ntrepreneur universities  X  based on the fact that they have been able to establish at least one spin -off company , and also they are collaborating wi th industries. The findings also show that universities in the Czech Republic are not only collaborating with industries, but also there have been cases of university -university collaboration where they jointly established at least a spin of company. So urce : own From the model above, it can be seen that, Masaryk University (MU) has been the most successful entrepreneur university in the Czech Republic, it has been able to establish nine (9) spin off companies. Again, both the University of Technology (U T) and the Czech Academy of Sciences (CAS) has also established three spin off companies each. Two more universities have also been able to spin out two firms each, they are the Charles University (CU) and the other one is a joint owned by University of Te chnology (UT) and Masaryk University (MU). The bulk of universities that have one spin off company include the Czech Technical University (CTU), Czech University of Life Sciences (CULS), the Institute of Technology and Business (ITB), Tomas Bata University (TBU), Technical University of Ostrava (TUO) and the University of West Bohemia (UWB). These universities have assumed the status of being classified as entrepreneurial universities.
 Source: own When it comes to the location and the regional distribution of spin -off firms in the Czech Republic, it can be seen that spinoff firms are not evenly distributed across the Czech Republic because some regions do not have any spin off firms even though they have some university. To start with the national capital region of Prague can boast of a total of five (5) spin off companies, and it X  X  worth noting that in most cases these spin off companies are located close to their parent university or in the same re gion, so that academics can work simultaneously for the spin off firm and the university. The universities of Charles university (CU), Czech University of Life Sciences (CULS), Czech Technical University (CTU), and the Czech Academy of Sciences (CAS) con tributed to the 5 spin offs in the Prague region. Additional, the region of Zlin has one spin off firm from the Tomas Bata University (TBU). The region of Pilsen also has a spin off established by the University of West Bohemia (UWB) so does the region of Ostrava and  X esk X  Bud X jovic where the Technical University of Ostrava (TUO) and the Institute of Technology and Business (ITB) contributed respectively to establish a spin off each . Again, We can see that the region of Olomouc, the Palacky University (UP) is located can boast of six (6) spin off companies making it the second largest region that has most spin off firms in the Czech Republic thanks to the university commercializing its research. Lastly, the region of Brno has the highest That is due to the fact that, it has University of Technology (UT) and the Masaryk University (MU). These two entrepreneur universities are the only universities that have collabo rated and established joint spin off firm in the whole country Conclusion In as much as the concept of entrepreneur ial universities or the triple helix collaborative network consisting of universities, industries and government is new to the Czech Republic, Czech universities have made great strides to share their academic research with industries. Although not all Czech universities have been able to collaborate with industries through technology transfers and spin -off creation, this paper has been able to demonstrate that, significant number of universities can be classified as entrepreneur .
 In all 12 universities in th e Czech Republic can be classified as entrepreneur ial due to the fact that they have been associated with a spin -off company, which was established through the initiatives of their academic staffs. These universities of Masaryk University (MU), Palacky Uni versity (UP), University of Technology (UT), University of West Bohemia (UWB), Technical University of Ostrava (TUO) and the Institute of Technology and Business (ITB), Charles university (CU), Czech University of Life Sciences (CULS), Czech Technical Uni versity (CTU), and the Czech Academy of Sciences (CAS) as the entrepreneur universities in the Czech Republic.
 When it comes to the regional distribution of entrepreneur ial universities and their  X  X aby X  spin offs, this paper has been able to demonstrate t hat the bulk of spin off companies or firms can be found in the region of Brno (14), followed by the region of Olomouc (6), and the Prague region also has 5 spin off firms making it the third largest region where spin offs are located when it comes to the Czech Republic .
 This paper therefore suggest further research to show why most universities in the Czech Republic have continued to remained in their academic empires and not collaborating with industries. This can help to understan d the low rate of spin off among universities and other higher educational institutions as well as to come out of recommendations that can help to bring non collaborative universities out of their stagnation. Again further research can also be directed towards finding out the factors behind the success of Masaryk University (MU), Palacky U niversity (UP) in their commercialization process so that this can become a model for other Czech universities.
