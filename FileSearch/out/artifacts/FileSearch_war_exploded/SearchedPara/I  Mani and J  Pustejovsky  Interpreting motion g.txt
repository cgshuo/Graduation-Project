 Giovanna Marotta 1 Introduction The book under review is the fifth volume of the series Exploration in Language and Space of OUP. It is organized into six chapters: the odd-numbered chapters and part of Chapter 6 are written by Mani, whereas the even-numbered chapters by Pustejovsky.

The main aim of the study is to present an integrated perspective on several aspects related to motion: language structure and semantics, concepts of motion, methods for annotating corpora, formal representations needed for computer reasoning about motion. The approach is thus strongly interdisciplinary, with emphasis on formal semantic models and computational reasoning.

It is worth underlying that the current reviewer is a linguist, whereas the point of view assumed by the Authors belongs to the framework of computer sciences in general and more specifically to computational linguistics. As a matter of fact, the linguistic research on the topic of space aims at describing and interpreting how space is encoded in the lexicon and in the grammar of natural languages, without disregarding the interaction of concept representations with language and perception (Marotta 2010 ). On the other hand, this book presents an interdisciplinary perspective in which the semantic structures of language are approached in the perspective of formal representations needed for computer processing of data about motion. Therefore, the semantic model here developed is targeted to computational representation and explicitly conceived as being formally representable.

With such a premise, the authors support a compositional and truth-conditional approach, as being suitable in a computational approach. By contrast, embodied cognitive as well as functionalist (e.g., Herkovits 1986 ; Vandeloise 1991 ) approaches are criticized for being not compositional and not truth-conditional (see the criticism about Herkovits X  X  1986 proposal, pp. 13 ff.). 2 Contents The first chapter is a general introduction to the topic, containing aims, challenges and theoretical background. First of all, the Authors believe that a semantic theory of motion can be usefully implemented for computation; moreover, computational models based on information derived from text input may allow for an automatic mapping of spatial representations. Their approach may be classified as basically empirical, mainly grounded on corpora found on the Web (newsletters, travel blogs, etc.). Corpora have been first annotated by humans and then used to train computational learning algorithms aiming at reproducing the annotation system. The final step is the mapping of the annotations into formal representations, in order to develop automatic systems showing spatial text-to-map capability, i.e. tools interpreting motion language and transferring it into visual schemata.

The Authors present a synthesis of the state-of-the-art in current linguistic studies about motion and spatiality, highlighting pros and cons of the different approaches (functionalist, embodied, etc.) with specific reference to computational implemen-tation. References to linguistic studies on motion and spatial language are recalled and often examined in depth throughout the volume.

The second chapter addresses the ways motion is expressed in natural languages (English in fact), taking into account both static and dynamic spatial descriptions. A preliminary semantic framework including primitive topological relations is assumed, and enriched with notions of orientation and distance. In order to build their formal representations of spatial language, the Authors introduce the notion of argument structure and motion event. They examine path and manner verbs and propose to analyze them in terms of topological and orientational (i.e. projective, in current linguistic literature) relations.

The third chapter specifically deals with spatial relations (topological, orienta-tional) and related categories (e.g. Frames of Reference) with regards to their computational properties.

The fourth chapter first considers previous Qualitative Spatial Reasoning models that have addressed the issue of motion and then is concerned with the Authors X  proposal for modeling the semantic parameters employed in the language of motion. The model proposed (called Dynamic Interval Temporal Logic ) combines encoding of motion with reference to the temporal framework and is integrated with the Generative Lexicon by Pustejovsky ( 1995 , 2001 ), thus improving previous Qualitative Spatial Reasoning motion representations and providing a computa-tional model of motion semantics.

Methodology for the semantic annotation of space are discussed in the fifth chapter. ISO-Space is considered as particularly attractive by the Authors, as showing temporal reasoning, alongside a rich representations of paths and the distinction between path and manner verbs. ISO-Space is an annotation scheme designed for capturing spatial and spatio-temporal information in natural language texts and can be integrated with information coming from other modalities (e.g., GPS). The main differences between ISO-Space and more linguistic-oriented annotation systems are analyzed in Meini et al. ( 2012 ).

Some applications of the proposed semantic model (e.g., route navigation, multimedia tagging, etc.) and future challenges (like application to fictive motion, cross-linguistic perspective, etc.) are presented in the sixth and last chapter of the book. 3 The model and the generative lexicon The Authors X  goal is the fine-grained classification of spatial meaning, and especially of motion semantics, which should be compositional and truth-conditional in order to parcel the meaning of the spatial linguistic expressions without the proliferation of tags.

Given this aim, the Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky 1995 , 2001 ) is integrated in the semantic model. Indeed, the Qualia structure provides a useful insight for the interpretation of the polysemy occurring in the spatial prepositions. For instance, in the expression coffee in the cup the meaning of in can be specified without proliferation of senses by the integration of semantic information included in the lexical entry cup (open container made of solid material used for drinking), in (underspecified notion of containment) and coffee (liquid material). The specific sense of in is thus  X  X  X chieved within a compositional semantics [ ... ] via an axiom of world knowledge X  X  (p. 25). Spatial meaning is recognized as not exclusively carried by the spatial prepositions and spatial semantics, but conceived as distributed on several element of the sentence. It is worth to remind the reader that this insightful approach has been already suggested by Sinha and Kuteva ( 1995 ) in their model Distributed Spatial Semantics .
 Moreover, the Qualia structure allows us to represent the intrinsic Frame of Reference by means of the  X  X  X elic X  X  Quale (p. 68). In the intrinsic Frame of Reference, coordinates are determined by the so-called  X  X nherent features X  (i.e. sidedness or facets, however not ontologically determined but rather depending on cultural aspects) of the ground entity: artifacts like autos, TV, etc. have  X  X  X elic roles X  X  indicating how the artifacts are used and as part of that use their orientation can be enumerated as a component of the lexical entry. The Qualia structure is thus a very promising tool, which can account for the role played by NPs associated to ground and figure entities in determining spatial meaning. 4 Critical remarks As regards motion semantics, the Authors propose a typological classification of languages with respect to the coding of path, similar to that of Talmy ( 1985 , 1991 , 2000 ) and Slobin ( 2004 ), although with some differences.

Talmy X  X  identification of three sub-components (Deixis, Vector and Conforma-tion) within Path is for instance not taken into account. Furthermore, Talmy X  X  distinction between path and manner verbs is in fact reinterpreted (chapter 1, 2, 4) in the light of the distinction between two different logical-semantic classes: action-based predicates, which do not make reference to distinguished locations (corresponding to manner-verbs found in satellite framing patterns, e.g. to run ) and location-based verbs, which do make reference to distinguished locations focusing on salient points on the path (corresponding to path-verbs found in verb framing patterns, e.g. to arrive ). The basic distinction thus becomes that between  X  X  X ovement with distinguished location X  X  (path verbs) and  X  X  X ovement without distinguished location X  X  (manner of motion verbs) X  X  (see p. 49).

Path verbs are ultimately analyzed in terms of static spatial relations (p. 39), alongside a possible distinguished point of region on the path, which the figure is moving toward or away from. This appears to be a noteworthy point, which may open new perspectives on the theoretical assumptions about the semantics of motion verbs. Path verbs can be differentiated according to which qualitative dimensions are involved in their definition (e.g. to exit is considered a topological path, since it is grounded on the topological notion of  X  X  X nternal X  X  and  X  X  X xternal X  X ; to ascend is considered an orientation path, since it is grounded on the projective notion of  X  X  X ertical axis X  X , p. 43). This perspective may provide a more fine-grained semantic classification for path verbs.

Manner verbs are interpreted as verbs denoting motion activity and the vehicle of this activity ( to bike , to drive ). Moreover, in the Authors X  proposal, it is also possible to distinguish manner verbs on the basis of topological-orientational constraints that hold during the movement (see p. 50). For instance, in the verb to fly , the topological constraint is DC ( Disconnected , i.e. figure and ground are not connected, cf. p. 31) throughout motion. The difference between the subclasses of manner verbs can also include the parameter of orientation, e.g. in to climb (cf. the discussion at p. 45). Nevertheless, although this kind of classification of manner verbs is surely suitable for computational processing and reasoning, it appears sometimes not sufficient from a purely linguistic point of view. For example, to bounce and to run would be identical in their semantic representation except for the fact that in to run only a part of the figure (i.e. feet) is in touch with the ground. Moreover, in this model to run , to skip and to walk would not present any differentiation in their semantic representation (see p. 50), whereas the linguistic competence of native speakers of English would suggest that some differences do exist.

We have already underlined that this volume takes a computational point of view on spatial language more than a purely linguistic one, although linguistic studies are taken into account. However, we have noticed some incoherence in the use of the scientific linguistic literature on space. Especially in the case of the static spatial domain, the notions of topological and projective (here called orientational) relations are handled very differently with respect to the linguistic studies about space. Topological and projective relations are normally kept distinct in the scientific literature at least since from Piaget and Inhelder ( 1948 ) and this distinction is still maintained in current linguistic research. In all respects, these two kinds of spatial relation are quite dissimilar in nature. Topological relations refer to containment, contiguity (touching) and proximity (nearness) and are grounded on the idea that entities can be subdivided in topological sub-spaces (Becker 1997 ). Projective relations presuppose the notion of (gaze) direction and a system of axes. Topological and projective relations are also quite different at the cognitive level, as shown by the fact that first spatial concepts acquired by children are the topological notions of proximity, order, closure, and continuity and only later they understand the Euclidean notions of metric distance and angle, and are able to grasp geometrical projective relations (Piaget and Inhelder 1948 ).

However, in this volume topological and projective relation are sometimes mixed (cf. the examples at p. 32): formal representations of prepositional meaning incorporate both topological and projective notions. For instance, the meaning of on in a sentence like The glass is on the table is represented by means of the combination of two semantic primitives belonging to topological and projective domain respectively: Externally Connected (EC) and OVER. The semantic notion of OVER would be needed to distinguish the meaning of on in The glass is on the table from, e.g., The picture is on the wall , in which OVER would be substituted by NEXT_TO. In the Authors X  opinion in the semantic representation including only the topological notion Externally Connected (EC)  X  X  X he glass could be touching the leg, the bottom, or the side of the table X  X  (p. 32). Furthermore, the feature Externally Connected (EC) is to some extent in contrast with the feature OVER, as OVER is ultimately grounded on the notion of projected vertical axis. In fact, the Authors recognize that the activation of the correct sense of on depends on the properties of the figure table versus wall . Nevertheless, mixing topological and projective is assumed as necessary to represent the meaning of on in the two contexts.

Some controversial points can also be noticed as regards traditional terms relative to spatial language. For instance, Talmy X  X  notions of figure and ground are defined as semantic elements (p. 8), although in Talmy ( 1985 , 1991 , 2000 ) they are explicitly referred to as conceptual, and non-semantic components.

At p. 49 the term  X  X  X ovement X  X  is used in the sense of  X  X  X otion X  X . However, linguistic literature about space normally distinguishes the notions of  X  X  X ovement X  X  and  X  X  X otion X  X : the first refers to the manner of displacement, whereas the second is a hyperonym for  X  X  X ovement X  X  and  X  X  X isplacement X  X .

Since the Authors X  main point is not linguistic analysis but rather an interdisciplinary approach with emphasis on formal semantic models and compu-tational reasoning, linguistic bibliography about space and motion is not exhaustive. Indeed, they explicitly declare:  X  X  X he book is interdisciplinary and as a consequence there are several deliberate lacunae. Questions of pragmatics are not addressed and also bibliography is not exhaustive X  X  (p. 26).

We can marginally notice that the state-o f-the-art synthesis about motion verb classification does not mention Slobin X  X  mos t recent scientific production on the topic. In particular, Slobin ( 2008 , 2009 ) has reformulated the typological dichotomy Verb -framed vs Satellite -framed in terms of language tendency for Path-in-Verb (PIV) or Path-in-Non-Verb (PIN) constructions, thus shiftin g toward a continuum, also accounting for languages whose typology cannot be defin ed in strictly dichotomous terms. 5 Conclusion Interpreting motion: grounded representations for spatial language is a high-quality volume that deserves the attention of any computational linguist or cognitive scientist with an interest in qualitative spatial reasoning models, computer reasoning about motion and corpus annotation.

The volume includes an extensive and critical discussion of the current qualitative spatial models and methodologies of semantic annotation needed for computational processing of motion data.

We think that theoretical linguists may also profit from this book, since it can suggest new perspectives on theoretical aspects of spatial semantics and offer sources of inspiration to improve the analysis of linguistic categories encoding space and motion.
