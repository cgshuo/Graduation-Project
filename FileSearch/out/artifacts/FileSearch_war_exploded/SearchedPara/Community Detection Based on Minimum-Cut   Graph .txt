 network vertices into communities in which the connections of vertices are dense, but community detection, we first get insight into the definition of community. There are several classes of global community definitions [5]: partitioning/clustering problem aiming at producing division with smallest cut size; (ii) Another one is based on the widely used concept of modularity . Modularity evaluates how a given division deviates from an expected random graph (null model), rithms for detecting community because of its reasonable accuracy and feasibility. modularity maximization and problem of minimum-cut graph partitioning which mi-nimizes the cut size. [7] focused on the maximization of the likelihood of generating a minimum-cut problem. Our research is inspired by it, however, we focus on the max-could be transformed into minimum-cut graph partitioning, and (ii) normalized mod-detection problem [13, 15]. As an example, we apply the Laplacian spectral partition-rithm competitive with the best currently available algorithms in terms of both speed and quality of results. 
The other contribution of this paper is that we innovatively combine the modularity theory with popular statistical inference method. Research about community detection rithm and inference model-based algorithm: modularity maximization problem based on the analysis in [11]; we adapt such objective function for our optimization. 
Based on the rigorous demonstrations, the implementation of the proposed algo-solutions by implementing Laplacian spectral partitioning algorithm; then we compute guarantee the feasibility and robustness of the proposed demonstration. To the best of algorithms. in networks for decades [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]. In [1], Newman describes an algorithm based algorithms were proposed based on other theories [10, 12]. Recently, interest has par-partitioning, dividing the vertices of a graph into some communities of given size (not tioning.

Original stochastic block model ignores variation in vertex degree, making it unsuita-stochastic block model adds a parameter  X   X  for each vertex pected degree of vertex  X  , making it accommodate arbitrary degree distributions. 
In this paper, let  X  and  X  be sets of  X  vertices and respectively, and use  X  to denote the number of communities.  X   X  X  X   X 0 . And  X   X  X  is an element of a  X  X  X  symmetric matrix of parameters, control-ling edges between communities. Followi ng [11], we let expected value of  X  generating  X  X , X  X  X  is 
Parameter  X  is arbitrary within a multiplicative constant absorbed into their normalization can be fixed by imposing the constraint ues of parameters  X   X  and  X   X  X  are given by  X  . As the number of edges connecting community  X  and  X  profile likelihood rather than itself, because the maximum is in the same place. Neg-lecting overall constants, the logarithm is given by 
This log likelihood depends on community structure only. Since the block model is community detection algorithms, the maximum of Eq.(4) with respect to the commu-nity structure could tell us the most suitable community structure. problem of (normalized) modularity maximization could be transformed into the problem of (normalized) minimum-cut graph partitioning . 4.1 Preliminaries Given (i) a graph  X  X , X  X  X  with  X  vertices and  X  edges, (ii) a partition  X  of  X  communities  X  X   X  X  X   X   X ,..., (iii) a null model (random graph distribution)  X  on  X 
Modularity  X  X  X , X , X  X  X  X  is defined as wherein |...| is the size of the corresponding set, randomness. There are several choices of the null model  X  , such as Erd X s-Renyi model [17] and Chung-Lu model [18]. The original stochastic block models have an internal relation produces highly unrealistic networks. Specifically, it produces networks with Poisson fixes the expected degree sequence to be the same as that of the observed network. In this case, the objective function of modularity could also be rewritten as which is a constant. If the edges of a network is randomly assigned, then on average, 
This choice of null model is found to give significantly better results than the for-high degree are, more likely to be connected than those with high degree. So, we get better results with incorporating this observation into stochastic block model, and we get degree-corrected stochastic block model [11]. we need to maximize the |  X   X   X   X   X  X  in Eq. (5) (or  X  is the statistically expected value, we should maximize  X  |  X   X   X  of  X |  X   X   X  , X   X  | . For the same reason, we should maximize tion is to maximize Eq. (5) or Eq. (6). 4.2 Demonstration 1: Mapping from Modularity Maximization to  X  by a small amount of manipulation, which will be discussed latter, respectively. 
If high value of modularity  X   X   X , X , X   X  corresponds to good division of a commu-nity structure, the purpose of algorithm is to find such division with the global maxi-mum modularity, as follows: 
To simplify the description, we define the following quantity as the cut size of the partition  X  . And minimum-cut partitioning problem optimizes Theorem 1. The modularity maximization of Eq. (8) could be transformed into mini-mum-cut partitioning of Eq. (10). Proof. Objective function of modularity maximization (Eq. (8)) could be written as 
Substituting Eq. (9) to Eq. (11), we get 
Eq. (12) is similar to the objective function of minimum-cut partitioning, except for the item  X   X |  X   X   X  , X   X  |  X   X  X  X  X  which depends on the null model ture. We first discuss the bisection condition (i.e.,  X 2 X  how the proposed algorithm could be extended to the condition of multi-communities. 
Thus, Eq. (12) could be rewritten as chastic block model and its degree-corrected counterpart respectively. Standard Stochastic Block Model. We rewrite Eq. (13) as where |  X   X   X   X  X  is the expected number of all edges in terms independent of the community structure, we get 
If we use  X   X  X  to denote the expected number of edges between community 1 and 2, 
Considering where  X   X  and  X   X  are numbers of vertices in communities 1 and 2 respectively, 
Thus the modularity maximization could be rewritten as:  X  X  X   X   X   X  |  X   X   X   X   X  X   X | X   X   X   X  , X   X  | X   X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X 
Instead of problem (8), we could address the problem of computing 
So the maximization of modularity corresponds to the minimization of the cut size of the partition with an additional penalty term  X  |  X   X   X   X  X   X   X  munities of equal size. Different graph distribution  X  leads to different value of and |  X   X   X   X  X  . So the quantity of the formula above varies when we apply various Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model. Dropping constant 
In degree-corrected stochastic block model, community 1 and 2, respectively. And, 
Considering the constraint  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X 1 for community s, 
Similarly, 
Instead of problem (8), we now could address the problem of computing formula over community structure first for fixed  X  , and then over 
In the above additional terms,  X   X  X  ,  X   X  X  ,  X   X  X  on  X  only. To get around such terms, we implement a limited minimization, in which  X  is given and the community sizes  X   X  and  X   X  choose. Hence discarding the constant terms  X  |  X   X   X   X  X   X  X   X  X  graph partitioning problem. 4.3 Demonstration 2: Mapping from Normalized Modularity Maximization to In this section, we show for that a normalized version of modularity maximization is identical to normalized cut spectral partitioning, whose objective function is 
We then define normalized modularity maximization as Theorem 2. The normalized modularity maximization of Eq. (28) is identical to nor-malized cut partitioning of Eq. (27). Proof. Eq.(28) could be written as 
Considering  X   X   X   X  X  X  X   X  X 2 , 
Meanwhile, Eq. (27) could also be written as 
Thus, 
Therefore, minimization of  X   X  is identical to maximization of minimizing normalized cut is identical to maximizing normalized modularity. 4.4 The Implementation of Community Detection Based on Minimum-Cut  X  X  X  X  X  structure. We recursively partition a current community into two sub-coummunities using the second eigenvector of the generalized Laplacian matrix, lated such eigenvector, one divides the network into communities of the required size and  X   X  by inspecting the vector elements and assigning the mum-cut divisions of the network [7].

This article mainly utilizes normalized mutual information (NMI) [19] as evaluation, and the experimental results showed the proposed algorithm worked well. 5.1 Experiments on Real-World Networks We tested our algorithm on a range of real-world networks, and it produced commu-three networks in detail with the limitation of space. tions amongst the 34 members of a karate club at an American university, in Fig. 1(a).

The results show that MC performs as well as, even better than, [10], and there is also a sharp ascent of NMI as  X  increases from 0.3 to 0.4. Secondly, we compare the proposed algorithm with other networks of increasing sizes, and Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 3(c) present the NMI of compet-strong impact (Almost all the competing algo rithms suffer considerable loss in NMI, and most of them reach the peak when  X   X   X  is about 24.83). Different kinds of algorithms about community detection, such as (i) modularity-based algorithms, have been proposed. This article is an innovative attempt, aiming at explor-ing the potential connecting lines among them. the network, based on the demonstration that the problem of (normalized) modularity partitioning. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm has general-case of strong degree imbalances as in power-law distributions.
