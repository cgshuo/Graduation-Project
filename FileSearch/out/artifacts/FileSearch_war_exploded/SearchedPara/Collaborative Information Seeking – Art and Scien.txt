 The assumption of information s eekers being independent and IR problem being individual has been challenged often in the recent past, with an argument that the next big leap in search and retrieval will come through incorporating social and collaborative aspects of information seeking. This half-day tutorial will introduce the student to theories, methodologies, and tools that focus on information retrieval/seeking in collaboration. The student will have an opportunity to learn about the social aspect of IR with a focus on collaborative information seeking (CIS) situations, systems, and evaluation techniques. The course is intended for those interested in social and collaborative aspects of IR (from both academia and industry), and requires only a gene ral understanding of IR systems and evaluation.

 Collaborative information seeking (CIS); Tutorial. Traditionally, IR is considered an individual pursuit, and not surprisingly, the majority of tools, techniques, and models developed for addressing informa tion need, retrieval, and usage have focused on single users. The assumption of information seekers being independent and IR problem being individual has been challenged often in the recent past (e.g., [2,5,12]. This course will introduce such works to the students, with an emphasis on understanding models and systems th at support collaborative search or browsing. To put CIS in persp ective, the course will show the students how various related concepts, such as collaborative information behavior (CIB), co-b rowsing, co-search, collaborative filtering, can be placed on the dimensions of human-system and explicitness-implicitness along with CIS and CIR (Figure 1) for exploration and developmental needs, as well as evaluation purposes. Specifically, the course will (1) outline the research and latest developments in the field of colla borative IR, (2) list the challenges for designing and evaluating collabora tive IR systems, and (3) show how traditional single user IR mode ls and systems could be mapped various issues relating to CIS/CIR is very timely and relevant to the IR community. The three-hour course will follow a general structure given below.  X  Hour-1 : Discuss situations for CIS; Introduce a few group- X  Hour-2 : Discuss the back-end of CIS systems; Look at the  X  Hour-3 : Learn about existing approaches to data mining and Course materials will be made av ailable on a Web site hosted under http://collab.infoseeking.org/ two w eeks prior to the tutorial. They will include links to relevant software; links to publications that will be discussed; and mechanisms fo r communication (Twitter hashtags #cis2012 and #sigir2012, blog space, etc.) among the tutorial participants, before, during and after the tutorial. Since this course is focused on in troducing several relevant theories, models, approaches, and findings in the field of CIS/CIR, the participants will also be given an annotated bibliography that represents seminal works in this area.
