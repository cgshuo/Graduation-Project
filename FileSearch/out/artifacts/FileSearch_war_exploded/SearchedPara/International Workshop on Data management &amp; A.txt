 Reducing healthcare costs and improving quality of outcomes is a challenge even in developed economies. Much information remains in paper form, lack common standards, sharing is uncommon and frequently hampered by the lack of foolproof de-identification for patient privacy . All of these issues impede opportunities for data mining and analysis that would enable better predictive and preventive medicine. These issues are compounded in emerging economies due to geopolitical constraints, transportation and ge ographic barriers, a much more limited clinical workforce, and infrastructural challenges to delivery. Thus, simple, high-impact deliverable interventions such as universal childhood immunization and maternal childcare are hampered by poor monitoring and reporting systems. This workshop is focused on identifying challenges to be overcome for effectively delivering efficient healthcare and to the masses. Specifically, we will provide a forum to discuss research directions, share experience and insights from both academia and industry. The anticipated outcome of the workshop is an assessment of the state of the art in the area, as well as identification of critical next steps to pursue in this topic.

However, along with economic growth we also need well-func tioning civil institutions, secure individual and property rights, a nd most importantly broad-based health services for raising overall living standards. Therefore in 2000, under the guidance of Unite d Nations, governments across the world set out the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) , a series of commitments to lift around 500 million people out of poverty by 2015  X  and not surprisi ngly included reducing child &amp; mother mortality in childbirth as a key goal. Despite these efforts, in 2013, OxFam International reports that in developing countries every day 1,400 women die needlessly in pregnancy and childbirth. The problem is not of intent but an  X  X nability to scale X  the solutions of today i.e. cost effective access to medical care. The final program consists of oral presentations of papers selected by the program committee. The pa pers spanned a large array of disciplines related to healthcare data management and analytics. We would like to thank our Program Committee for helping set a high quality program for DARE 2013.
