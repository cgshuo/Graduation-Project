Preliminaries A team composition consists of experts, a weighted social network structure, and a set of skills as an undirected, weighted graph G SN ( U , E ) where the vertices are experts u ( prox ( u i , u i )=0). The proximity prox ( u i , u j ) between two experts is de
An expert's skill pro fi le P i contains for each skill a corresponding expertise level q from 0 to 1, where 1 describes the maximum achievable expertise. Set of required skills for a team is denoted as team con fi guration T ( U T , S R ) consists of experts U expert's skill pro fi le. Speci fi cally for each skill, there exists a mapping function f from the set of an expert's edges E u .

We, thus, can infer that also the observed team formation problem is NP-complete. 4.4. Modeling the objective functions having maximum experience level q ( s )=1) for every skill s We denote the best possible composition ( C ( T )=1) as Top ( tight relations between the experts. Hence, we try to reduce a team's distance collaboration. The direct team distance (Eq. (3) ) is thus de links between members, and subtracting the number of existing intra team links (|
