 Statistical modelling of Information Retrieval (IR) systems is a key driving force in the development of the IR field. The goal of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to statistical IR modelling. We take a fresh and systematic perspective from the viewpoint of port-folio theory of IR and risk management. A unified treat-ment and new insights will be given to reflect the recent developments of considering the ranked retrieval results as a whole. Recent research progress in diversification, risk man-agement, and portfolio theory will be covered, in addition to classic methods such as Maron and Kuhns X  Probabilistic Indexing, Robertson-Sp  X  arck Jones model (and the resulting BM25 formula) and language modelling approaches. The tutorial also reviews the resulting practical algorithms of risk-aware query expansion, diverse ranking, IR metric op-timization as well as their performance evaluations. Practi-cal IR applications such as web search, multimedia retrieval, and collaborative filtering are also introduced, as well as dis-cussion of new opportunities for future research and applica-tions that intersect among information retrieval, knowledge management, and databases.

In classic IR modelling, considerable effort has been de-voted to automatically scoring individual documents with respect to their relevance states for a specific information need (query) and consequently ranking the documents in decreasing order of the individual scores. This approach is based on the underlying theory of the Probability Ranking Principle. Recently, there has been a new type of theoretical research that moves beyond the Probability Ranking Prin-ciple to determine optimal ranking algorithms that consider the ranking context or that regard the set of returned doc-uments as a whole. These research efforts include marginal relevance, diversity, alternative retrieval objectives, robust query expansion, sub-topic retrieval, and pair-wise or list-wise comparison (learning to rank) to name only a few.
A possible general theory to support and justify the above developments would be the Portfolio Theory of IR. Drawing an analogy with finance and risk modelling, the Portfolio Theory of IR has theoretically demonstrated that in a wide variety of IR scenarios, from expanding queries to retriev-ing documents, effective, robust and less risky solutions do not just involve picking or ranking individual relevant doc-uments or query terms, but require choosing an appropriate combination of relevant documents or query terms as a set.
This approach significantly departed from the classic IR methodologies originated from the Probability Ranking Prin-ciple, the Robertson-Sp  X  arck Jones model (and the resulting BM25 formula), and statistical language models. We de-scribe how new ways of thinking about document portfo-lio and retrieval risk not only provide theoretical explana-tions of some empirical retrieval results  X  including the need for diversification in recommendation and web search, the trade-off between MAP and MRR, and the justification for pseudo-relevance feedback  X  but also help us develop useful retrieval techniques such as risk-aware query expansion and optimal document ranking. We also discuss the implications for how retrieval systems are evaluated.
