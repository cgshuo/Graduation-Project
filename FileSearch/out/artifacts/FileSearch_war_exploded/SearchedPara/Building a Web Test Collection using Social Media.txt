 Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms contain a large number of questions and associated answers. An-swerers sometimes include URLs as part of the answers to provide further information. This paper describes a novel way of building a test collection for web search by exploit-ing the link information from this type of social media data. We propose to build the test collection by regarding CQA questions as queries and the associated linked web pages as relevant documents. To evaluate this approach, we collect approximately ten thousand CQA queries, whose answers contained links to ClueWeb09 documents after spam filter-ing. Experimental results using this collection show that the relative effectiveness between different retrieval models on the ClueWeb-CQA query set is consistent with that on the TREC Web Track query sets, confirming the reliability of our test collection. Further analysis shows that the large number of queries generated through this approach com-pensates for the sparse relevance judgments in determining significant differences.

The most difficult part of building a test collection is per-haps creating a set of queries with associated relevance judg-ments. Click data can be used as a substitute in some cases, Figure 1: An example query with relevance judg-men ts generated from social media data. but this is not available for general use in academic environ-ments. In this paper, we explore an approach to generating a set of queries and relevance judgments for a collection of web documents by exploiting the information in social me-dia, and more specifically Community Question Answering to obtain useful information and to share potential answers. The collaborative nature of such platforms motivates inter-ested users to voluntarily engage in providing useful answers to many topics. Answerers sometimes provide URLs as part of their answers. These links are used to provide additional information, to explain more complicated concepts that can not be detailed in short paragraphs, or to present reliable citations, etc. Figure 1 shows an example of an answer that incorporates several URLs.

The central hypothesis of this paper is that these links can be regarded as relevant documents for the CQA question (or query). Although the relevance judgments obtained in this way are likely to be sparse, our expectation is that the large number of queries obtained will compensate for this.
In this paper, we collected a large number of question-answer pairs from existing and newly crawled CQA collec-tions. We then reduced this set to include only questions whose answers contained links, where the links pointed to documents in the ClueWeb09 collection. The final ClueWeb-CQA (CW-CQA) set of queries and relevance judgments was produced after some additional filtering to deal with issues htt p://answers.yahoo.com/ http://zhidao.baidu.com/ such as spam. To test the validity of this new test collection, the relative effectiveness of some well-known benchmark re-trieval models is evaluated and compared. Our CW-CQA results show that a term dependency model significantly out-performs a bag of words model, and pseudo-relevance feed-back techniques can be helpful in most cases. These findings are consistent with the results using standard TREC Web Track query sets. As expected, the relevance judgments are sparse and incomplete. Carterette et al. [4] demonstrated that, up to a point, evaluation over more queries with fewer judgments is as reliable as fewer queries with more judg-ments. Similarly, we show that evaluating using a sufficient number of queries shows significant differences between re-trieval models despite the incomplete relevance judgments.
The rest of paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 summa-rizes related work and Section 3 describes the methodology of building the CW-CQA test collection. We discuss the experimental results in Section 4. Section 5 makes closing remarks and discusses several future directions.
There have been several web test collections created for supporting reproducible experiments at TREC. Examples include .GOV2, WT2g, and WT10g as well as a recent larger collection ClueWeb09. For large collections, relevance judg-ing is mostly done through pooling techniques [7]. Such tech-niques assemble and judge results from multiple searches and systems, with the assumption that most relevant documents will be found.

Even with the use of pooling methods, creating relevance judgments is often costly and the judged results can be bi-ased and incomplete [2]. Buckley and Voorhees [1] proposed the metric bpref that is both highly correlated with exist-ing measures when complete judgments are available and more robust to incomplete judgment sets. For the Million Query Track at TREC 2007, Carterette et al. [4] presented two document selection algorithms [3] to acquire relevance judgments. Their results suggested that, up to a point, eval-uation over more queries with fewer judgments is more cost-effective and as reliable as fewer queries with more judg-ments.
We build the CW-CQA test collection using large CQA large number of question-answer pairs from the CQA cor-pora and harvest all links provided in answers. We then reduce this set to include only questions whose answers con-tained links pointing to ClueWeb09 documents. We obseve that some of the links contained in CQA answers can be con-sidered to be spam pages. To ensure a reliable test collec-tion, we filter the reduced question sets based on two spam-controlling parameters S R and S A . Cormack et al [5] pro-posed a content-based classifier that quantifies the  X  X pam-miness X  of a document based on a scale of 0 to 100, where a lower score indicates that the page has a higher likelihood to be spam. Accordingly, S A calculates the average spam score of all links L Q extracted for a question Q and S R records ht t p://lemurproject.org/clueweb09/ the ratio of spam links among L Q 4 . Varying S R and S A fects the final number of queries and the proportion of spam links. After filtering, we can establish our final CW-CQA test collection by using the remaining questions and asso-ciated links as test queries and relevance judgments. We dicuss the parameter settings in Section 4.
We test four existing retrieval models including query like-lihood model (QLM), relevance model (RM) [8], sequential dependency model (SDM) [9] and a query expansion model using latent concept expansion (LCE) [10]. We choose these models because they include both common baselines used in other papers and methods that are state-of-the-art in terms of effectiveness.

QLM computes the likelihood of generating query texts based on documents models, and can often be written as:
RM ranks documents according to the odds of their being observed in the relevant class. P ( w | q i . . . q k ) can be effec-tively used to approximate P ( w | R ) with w as a word in the collection.

SDM is an effective instantiation of the Markov random field for information retrieval (MRF-IR) that makes the se-quential dependence assumption. It ranks documents by: LCE is a robust query expansion technique based on MRF-IR. This technique provides a mechanism for modeling term dependencies during expansion. The central idea is to com-pute a probability distribution over latent concepts using a set of pseudo-relevant documents in response to Q . Retrieval is then done by incorporating the top k latent concepts with the highest likelihood into original MRF model. Details of these models can be found in the appropriate papers. CQA datasets . We used two large CQA datasets, Yahoo dataset (YA). Corpus Y6 provides a 10/25/2007 Yahoo! An-swers dump. We additionally crawled the YA corpus by us-ing the Yahoo! Answers API. Specifically, we collected up to 10,000 questions for each of the 26 Yahoo root categories number of questions N Q , the average number of associated answers per question N Aavg , and the average number of links per question N Lavg in first row. http://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/ Answers data starting from 7/31/12 to 9/5/12.

Connecting CQA and ClueWeb . To find connec-tions, we then compared the CQA links with two subsets of ClueWeb09 pages, namely Category A (CatA) and Category B (CatB), which contain approximately 500M and 50M En-glish documents, respectively. The second and third rows in Table 1 summarize the number of questions whose answers contained links to the ClueWeb data N Q and their corre-number of links each question has ( n url ) and the frequency of questions with n url links ( n Q url ). Since this is a log-log plot, Figure 2 shows that n url and n Q url follow a power law distribution; that is, questions with few links occupy a sig-nificant portion of entire population. R 2 statistics show the goodness of the fit. The connection distributions for CatA and CatB resemble each other; in the following, we focus on evaluation using the ClueWeb09 CatB connections and searching on CatB for computational efficiency.

Queries and Relevance Judgments . To build the fi-nal test collection, we aggregate questions from Y6 and YA constrained by S R  X  0 . 1, S A  X  90 and n url &gt; 1. The con-straint n url &gt; 1 is used to avoid the extremes in the power law distributions shown in Figure 2. A final set of 9988 questions are selected as the CW-CQA test queries and the associated links are regarded as relevance judgments. This set is denoted as the 10k set. We construct an additional query set by selecting queries from 10k that have at least one relevant document returned by any of the four retrieval models described in Section 3, resulting in the query set 3k considered only once. containing 3440 questions. The maximum n url in query sets 10k and 3k are respectively 22 and 19, and the minimum for both is 2. The relation of n url and n Q url remains as power law distributions for both query sets. The nature of CQA questions can make the queries quite long. We apply stop structure removal techniques [6] to the CW-CQA queries and Figure 3 compares the query length distributions.
For comparison, we use 148 standard TREC web track 2009, 2010 and 2011 title and description (desc) queries. We search these TREC queries on ClueWeb09 CatB and evalu-ate the results using standard TREC relevance judgments. Figure 3 suggests that the CW-CQA queries are more simi-lar to TREC description queries in terms of query length.
Retrieval Setup . Indri 8 is used for indexing and search-ing. We use Dirichlet smoothing with  X  = 2500 for all runs without tuning. We apply spam filtering to all retrieval runs based on [5]. We evaluate using the top 1000 documents and report mean average precision (MAP), precision at 10/100 (P@10, P@100), mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and bpref.
Table 2 shows the retrieval performance of the CW-CQA query sets 10k and 3k where the top performing runs are underlined. We perform paired t-tests on pairs of retrieval models (QLM, SDM), (QLM, RM) and (SDM, LCE). Specif-ically, RM and SDM are marked  X  if p-value &lt; 0 . 05 com-pared to QLM. LCE is marked  X  if p-value &lt; 0 . 05 compared to SDM. We observe that SDM significantly outperforms QLM in both query sets for every metric. RM can signifi-cantly improve QLM for most metrics, showing the utility of pseudo-relevance feedback. LCE seems to improve SDM, but the significant difference is only observed for metrics P@100 and bpref. In general, models SDM and LCE are the most effective compared to others. The performance of the 10k and 3k query sets show similar trends. For query set 3k, MRR shows that on average all models rank the first known relevant document above rank 20.

Table 3 shows the retrieval performance of TREC title and desc queries. Similar to CW-CQA results, SDM significantly outperforms QLM in all cases. For title queries, unlike CW-CQA results, pseudo-relevance feedback techniques such as RM and LCE sometimes can hurt performance of QLM and SDM, respectively. The utility of pseudo-relevance feedback is more evident for desc queries. The similarity of the query length for CW-CQA queries and TREC descriptions pro-vides a possible explanation for the higher level of consis-tency between their results.

In general, the relative effectiveness between retrieval mod-els is similar for CW-CQA and TREC queries. The improve-ments based on term dependency modeling are significant ht t p://www.lemurproject.org/indri/ Table 2: Retrieval results for CW-CQA query sets 10k and 3k.

Table 3: Retrieval results for TREC query sets. for all query sets.

The absolute retrieval performance in Table 2 is rather low compared to Table 3. This is to be expected given the sparseness of relevance judgments. Carterette et al. [4] sug-gested that evaluation over more queries with fewer judg-ments can be reliable. Similarly, an interesting question from our perspective is: how many queries do we need to confirm the existence of significant differences between re-trieval models? To this end, we compute the p-value be-tween QLM and SDM using different number of CW-CQA queries. Specifically, from the 3k set, we randomly sample k queries where k ranges from 100 to 3400 in steps of 100. We perform 20 random samples at each k and report the average p-value in Figure 4. All metrics share a tendency that using more queries results in smaller p-values. For met-rics such as MAP, MRR and P@10, stable significance (i.e., p-value &lt; 0.05) is reached when the sample size grows be-yond 2100. For other metrics such as P@100 and bpref, a sample size of more than 1000 queries is sufficient to confirm a significant difference. These observations support [4] in a sense that evaluating using a sufficient number of CW-CQA queries distinguishes retrieval model effectiveness despite in-complete judgments.
We proposed a novel way of building a test collection for web search by considering CQA questions as queries and the associated URLs as relevant documents. This approach has the advantage that a large number of queries and rel-evance judgments can be gathered automatically and effi-ciently. We filtered CW-CQA queries based on the spam scores of their links. Experimental results on the CW-CQA query sets show that the relative effectiveness between differ-ent retrieval models is consistent with previous findings us-ing the TREC queries, showing the reliability of the test col-lection. The relevance judgments for the CW-CQA queries are incomplete and the absolute retrieval performance is rel-atively low. However, we demonstrated that evaluation us-ing a sufficient number of queries ensures that significant Figure 4: Average p-value of 20 times of sampling at e ach sample size. differences can be found.

These initial experimental results indicate several direc-tions for future work. Validating consistency with manual relevance judgments will be important for our study. We plan to select a small set of queries for human assessors to judge, and compare the results with the automated ap-proach. In addition, we will evaluate the same method using the newly constructed ClueWeb12 collection. The CW-CQA query sets for both ClueWeb09 and ClueWeb12 will be dis-tributed through the Lemur project.
