 Interpersonal interaction plays an important role i n organizational dynamics, and understanding these in teraction networks is key for any organization, since they ca n be tapped to facilitate various organizational processes. The pr incipal roadblock to studying organizational networks, howe ver, has been the difficulty in collecting data about them. The approach of conducting surveys/interviews is fraught with is sues of scalability, logistics, and reporting bias  X  especi ally since a survey of this nature can seem quite intrusive. Wid espread use of computer networks for organizational communicati on provides a unique opportunity to eliminate all thes e difficulties and automatically map the organizational network to a high degree of accuracy and detail. This paper describes an approach to automatically build organizational networks by t apping into the e-mail server, which observes all organizationa l communication. Specifically, our approach focuses o n studying how communication between actors is perceived by ot her actors in a social network. Such type of networks are form ally referred to as socio-cognitive networks (i.e. a "who knows, who knows who" network). The key issues addressed by this pap er are the representation and construction of a socio-cognitiv e network from electronic communication data as well as ident ifying and proposing techniques analyses of such networks. Eac h actor in the socio-cognitive network has a "set of beliefs" about the communication between other actors in the network. We propose a model for representing and constructing t he socio-cognitive network, where communication between acto rs is represented as probability distributions. Each acto r attempts to estimate these distributions using Bayesian inferen ce, based only on the communication he/she observes. The conflict in beliefs between different actors, and their divergence from reality, is analyzed by comparing the belief models of actors. Measures which quantify the notions of "misperception" (dive rgence of an actor X  X  beliefs from reality), "agreement" (similar ity in beliefs of different actors) and "consensus" (general agreemen t in a group of actors) are introduced. We present results for t hese on the Enron email corpus. Our work, in addition to provid ing novel computational schemes to sociologists, also highlig hts an important aspect of social network analysis researc h where one focuses on how actors' perceptions evolve over time .

 Algorithms, Measurement Socio-cognitive network, misperception, agreement, consensus, Enron email data. Organization dynamics plays an important role in th e functioning of an enterprise. Understanding the dyn amics of organizational processes empower managers and enabl e them to effectively manage an enterprise's resources. Infor mal social and socio-cognitive networks in an organization play an important role in such processes and significant effort has b een made to study such organizational networks. However, most r esearch has relied on data collected manually (usually using su rveys and observing communications between individuals in mee tings) and hence are subject to a variety of noise (e.g. b iased opinions). The emergence of computer networks has enabled new ways of communication, e.g. e-mail and instant messaging, b etween individuals in an organization, leading to new soci al networks being established. In addition to enabling geograph ically-unrestricted communication between individuals, com puter networks also enable collection of gigabytes of unb iased data about communication between individuals. This provi des an unprecedented opportunity to study organizational s ocial networks, and new computational techniques are requ ired to do so. In this research, we study socio-cognitive networks based on email communication in an organization. Socio-cogni tive network analysis involves understanding who knows who knows who in a social network (see Figure 1). In case of ema il communication, an actor observes only those emails which are addressed to him/her (i.e. the actor is on the To, Cc or Bcc fields of those emails). For example, consider an e-mail sent by actor A to B, with Cc to C and Bcc to D. The analysis of the header reveals the following: B and C know that A and B communicated, and that all three of them know about this communication. However, neither B nor C knows that D was also sent this e-mail. A and D know everything, and both of them also know that B and C do not know of D's gett ing the e-mail. This analysis illustrates that a single e-mai l can create different beliefs among different people, depending on whether and how they are included in it. Based on the obser ved emails, an actor forms his/her beliefs about communication probabilities between different actors. An email communication ne twork can be defined using the actors as the nodes and edges between actors representing email communication bet ween them. Thus, the communication probabilities form th e weights for the edges. Modeling of such a communication net work is useful for analysis of such networks, and hence we propose a model using probability distributions for communica tion probabilities. A Bayesian inference technique is us ed for updating the probabilities in the model. For our an alysis, a closed world assumption is made, i.e. actors X  belie fs about probabilities in a communication network are based only on the emails exchanged, and no other interaction occurs o utside of the email network. A characteristic of modeling email communication pr obabilities between actors is their subjective nature, since ac tors observe only the set of emails entering their respective ma ilboxes. Thus, there can be differences in perceptions about commu nications for different actors. We propose a new metric, a-closeness, for measuring the agreement in the perceptions of two a ctors. The modeling of communication network separately for ea ch actor is egocentric socio-cognitive analysis, since the comm unication is studied from the actor's (called ego) perspective. On the other hand, an email server observes all communication be tween actors and thus can model the actual communication between all actors. This is the socio-centric socio-cognitive n etwork analysis. The discrepancy between the egocentric an d socio-centric socio-cognitive network analysis provides a measure of the discrepancy between an actor's belief and the r eality. A novel measure r-closeness is proposed for measuring such discrepancies. Application of the proposed model an d belief divergence analysis to Enron email corpus is illust rated. The main contributions of this paper are:-1) Proposing a model for representing and capturing perceptions in an email communication based social network. 2) Proposing types of analyses that can be done on a socio-cognitive network namely, agreement between a ctors' perceptions and closeness of actors' perceptions to reality. 3) Proposing novel measures (r-closeness and a-clos eness) for such analyses. 4) Application of proposed approach and measures fo r knowledge discovery, on organizational communicatio n data. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect ion 2 provides background on related literature in sociology and c omputer science. Section 3 describes the model for construc ting a socio-cognitive network from email data. Section 4 descri bes different analyses on a socio-cognitive network and proposes measures for the same. Section 5 discusses applications of t he proposed measures. Section 6 presents experimental results o n the Enron email dataset. Section 7 summarizes and concludes t he paper. Social network analysis has been an active field of study in sociology as well as anthropology. A social network is a social structure of people called actors , related (directly or indirectly) to each other through a common relation of interest [10]. A social network plays an important role in the disse mination of ideas, information or influences among the group. H owever, in any social network, it is not possible for everyone to be connected to everyone else, nor is it desirable [2] . Thus, the main motive of social network analysis is to study  X  X ho knows who X  in a social network. There are two types of an alyses of social networks: (i) Socio-centric (whole) network analysis , where the interactions between the entire well-defi ned set of people are studied; and (ii) Egocentric (personal) network analysis , where one studies the interactions between an act or (called  X  X go X ) and only those actors related (direc tly or indirectly) to the ego. Substantial research has illustrated the importance of such analyses in organizations. In an organization, info rmal networks are formed by relationships between employees acros s functions and/or divisions in order to accomplish tasks quick ly [5]. Such informal networks can cut through formal reporting procedures to jump start stalled initiatives and meet extraord inary deadlines. Informal networks can just as easily sabotage compa nies' best laid plans by blocking communication and fomenting opposition to change unless managers know how to identify and direct them. Social network analysis enables the understan ding of which actors are perceived as "friends" or "adversa ries" by others, and which actors are aware of the presence of which other actors. Taking this a step further is socio-cognitive netwo rk analysis, which analyzes  X  X ho knows who knows who X  in the soc ial network. This analysis is useful as it affects the perceptions of an actor about other actors, and hence the behavior of actors towards other actors, which is of prime importance in an organization. The beliefs for each actor are transl ated into a weighted digraph corresponding to the social networ k that exists from that actor's perspective. Using these digraphs , one can determine who thinks who is influential in the orga nization. This information is highly valuable for a manager to und erstand the existing informal network in the organization. One of the main reasons for computer networks (and Internet) to come into existence was to foster collaborative wor k between geographically dispersed researchers. These compute r networks have now turned into an infrastructure that support s social networks; connecting people, organizations as well as knowledge [9]. The widespread use of internet and t he growing online community of users have enabled the formatio n of social networks based on different relations of interest. For example, Usenet  X  a widely used online newsgroup  X  had more than 80,000 topic-oriented discussion groups (or social networks) in 2000. These discussion groups allow individuals to form geographically dispersed, loosely bound, social net works. On the other hand, computer networks also facilitate a n actor to participate in different social networks (communiti es). Thus enabling the actor to know many more other actors a nd increase his/her social capital. In an organization, it is p ossible to map the online actor (e.g. email address) to a real-wor ld actor (e.g. employee), and analysis of these interactions has t he potential of providing unbiased measures about social relationsh ips between real-world actors. An email server logs all the email exchanged betwee n employees in an organization. Thus, it gets an unbi ased view of all communication occurring between employees. Anal ysis of such email logs will provide an insight into the co mputer network based (in this case, email-based) social ne tworks. However, to analyze such gigabytes of data about em ails exchanged between employees (considering a medium s cale organization) asks for new computational techniques . With the availability of the Enron email corpus, there has b een a growing interest in applying computational techniques to an alyze e-mail-based social networks. Initial research on analysis of such email data has concentrated on applying traditional socia l network techniques and/or graph-based measures [3, 6 and 8] . In this research, we take a step further by providing novel computational techniques for socio-cognitive analys is of email data. This section presents a novel approach for automati c construction of a socio-cognitive network from the analysis of an organization X  X  email communication. Each actor participating in the communication netwo rk, has his/her view of (a certain portion of) the entire n etwork. Over a period of time, the actor develops certain beliefs regarding the communications in the social network around self, i .e. beliefs regarding who communicates with whom, based on what he/she has observed so far. Thus, in this framework, a soc io-cognitive network is the set of such beliefs for every actor in the social network. Consider an email communication network consisting of N actors denoted by the set, {A k | 1  X  k  X  N} . probability that a given email in the network is fr om actor A Thus, Let P y|x denote the probability of A y being a recipient of an email, given that A x has sent that email. Thus, x y A by sent emails of number Total P = Hence, A . P(x,y) represents the  X  X trength X  of the actor A communication with actor A y . Note that each email has a unique (single) sender, and thus events corresponding to a n email being sent by different actors are mutually exclusive. He nce, the following condition must always hold -The events corresponding to different actors being recipients of an email are not mutually exclusive as it is possib le for an email to have multiple recipients. This leads P(x,y) , i.e.  X  X n actor A being a sender and another actor A y being a recipient X , not being mutually exclusive for all pairs of actors. For exa mple an email can be an instance of the event  X  X rom sender A x as well as  X  X rom sender A x to recipient A y  X . But, since each email has one sender and at least one recipient, the foll owing condition must always hold -Note the event of some actor A x being the sender and A recipient is mutually exclusive to its complement, i.e. the event where either A x is not the sender or A y is not a recipient or both. The probabilities of these two events are P(x,y) and 1-P(x,y) respectively. being a recipient X  or it is not (see figure 2). 
Figure 2. Communication between actors expressed as Bernoulli distributions Beta distribution is the conjugate prior for the Be rnoulli distribution, a Bayesian inference on the parameter s of a Beta distribution is the most likely choice for maintain ing actors X  N(N-1) Beta distributions, where each Beta distribution J(x,y) is defined over the corresponding Bernoulli distributi on L(x,y) . If we denote the belief state for a given actor A k by B k B = {J(i,j) k for all order pairs (A i ,A j ) such that A where, J(i,j) k , the Beta distribution over the parameter of L(i,j) , is defined as A k  X  X  belief regarding the communication from A A (see figure 3). The probability density function for a Beta distrib ution with parameters  X  and  X  is, The above expression gives the probability density of a Bernoulli distribution that has probabilities p and 1-p (or parameter p ). Higher values of  X  relative to  X  cause the Beta distribution to favor Bernoulli distributions with higher values of p and vice-versa. The expected value for the paramet er p (based on the Beta distribution) of the Bernoulli d istribution is given by, Thus, the expected Bernoulli distribution i.e. {E[p], 1-E[p]} is obtained by simply normalizing the parameters of th e Beta distribution. Normally the parameters  X  and  X  are associated with particular outcomes of the Bernoulli trials ov er which the Beta distribution is defined. For example, if the B ernoulli distribution is over the probability p of obtaining heads on a coin toss, then a Beta distribution over the possib le values of p is defined as follows. The parameter  X  is taken as the number of times heads is observed and parameter  X  is the number of times tails is observed. For each observation of heads,  X  is incremented by 1 and on observing tails  X  is incremented by 1. This is same as Bayesian inference using a Beta dis tribution. For each Beta distribution J(x,y) k in the belief state B A , there are two parameters  X ( x,y) and  X ( x,y) . Based on the communication A k observes, he/she updates the parameters for all J(x,y) k in B k . Each email observed by the actor is a Bernoulli trial, where success for the Bernoulli L(x,y) is realized only if the email is from A x with A y being a recipient. We associate the parameter  X ( x,y) with the number of successes, i.e. the number of emails, observed by A k , that have been sent by A parameter  X ( x,y) with failures i.e. number of emails, observed by A , that are either not sent by A x or A y is not a recipient or both. Over time, as A k observes communication in the network, he/she maintains the parameters (for the various Beta dist ributions) by incrementing the corresponding parameters each obse rvation time. This is equivalent to Bayesian inference usin g Beta distribution, based on the observed communication. This sub-section addresses the issue of selecting p riors for the parameters of each of the distributions J(x,y) k in a given belief state B k . We choose priors such that  X ( x,y)=  X  x  X  y|x  X ( x,y) , where  X  x is the prior probability for A of an email and  X  y|x is the prior probability for A recipient given that A x has sent the email. Each probability in an actor X  X  belief state is expressed as a fraction of the communication in the network. Hence, the sum of the expected probabilities for all communications must always be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to (N-1) (see appendix A). Since, the events of different actors being senders is mutually exclusive, we must have  X   X  i = 1 . A simple solution is to go with uniform priors where each  X  x =1/N, N being the number of actors. For  X  y|x also we choose uniform priors i.e. the events of A being a recipient or not, given that the email has been sent by A , can be equally likely. In this case we assign  X  y|x =0.5. Thus, a simple solution for priors is  X ( x,y)=1/2N and  X ( x,y)=1-(1/2 X ). This choice of priors will not have much effect as the number of observations is usually relatively large compared to the prior magnitudes, which results in the  X  X ashing out X  of priors. Thus small initial values of  X ( x,y) and  X ( x,y) imply the low confidence in the priors. In the modeling of communication probabilities as B ernoulli distributions, we implicitly assume that these prob abilities are constant over time. However, this may not hold, sin ce as emails are sent out over time, these probabilities may cha nge. This is illustrated in figure 4-a , where, the curve corresponds to the actual communication probabilities at each instance from time 0 to t and the straight line represents the same communic ation probability modeled as a Bernoulli distribution, at time t . To address this issue, we choose to capture the dynami c nature of the communication probabilities using time slicing. Distinct time intervals of length  X  each are defined and the communication probabilities are assumed to be const ant over each time interval. Hence, the Beta distribution pa rameters are maintained for a length of one time interval only, using the observations made in that time interval. For each n ew time interval, one can either completely wash out the pr evious observations and start with fresh default prior val ues for the parameters or one may choose to scale down the para meters obtained at the end of time interval t-1 , and use them as priors for the next time interval t . This is but an approximation towards capturing the dynamic nature of the communication probabilities, with the accuracy inversely dependen t on the length of the time window (see figure 4-b). The opt imum size of the time window will usually depend on the nature o f the social network whose actors X  beliefs are being modeled. To model the temporally varying nature of beliefs, we denote the belief state of an actor at time t as B k,t . Formally, the belief state for the given actor A k at the given time t , is defined as, B = {J(i,j) k,t for all order pairs (A i ,A j ) such that A Here J(i,j) k,t is the Beta distribution, for a given ordered pair of actors (A i ,A j ) , maintained by the actor A k , at time t . The belief state of a given actor at time t reflect s what the actor believes to be the probabilities of the possible st rengths of different actor communications in the network at ti me t . A socio-cognitive network at a given time is the se t of belief states of all actors at that time. We start with an initial belief state for each actor, i.e. B k,0 for all 1  X  k  X  for all distributions having default prior values. As actors observe email communication, they update their beli ef states. In a socio-cognitive network, we also introduce a  X  X uper-actor X  , i.e. an actor who observes all the communication in the network. Such an actor is analogous to an entity su ch as the email server. A S the  X  X uper-actor X  observes all, its beliefs represent the complete and true knowledge. Hence, w e will use this  X  X uper-actor X  as a benchmark when we compare a ctors X  beliefs with reality. This conforms to the closed w orld assumption where all that has occurred is observed by the super-actor and anything that the super-actor has not obs erved does not occur. The super actor is treated similar to an y other actor w.r.t. assigning priors and time slicing. The Beta distributions in the belief state of an ac tor are completely expressed through their parameters. Ther efore, in order to maintain the belief states one needs to ma intain a set of counters corresponding to the various parameters. F or maintaining each of the  X ( x,y) parameters a set of N(N-1) counters is used; one for each Beta distribution. I n addition, a counter is maintained for the total number of email s observed by each actor. The  X ( x,y) parameter can be obtained by subtracting the  X ( x,y) counter from the  X  X otal number of emails X  counter. Counters for each of the  X ( x,y) parameters are initialized with their corresponding priors and the  X  X otal number of emails X  counters maintained by an actor keep track only of the communication observed by that actor. Thus, the mai ntenance of all actors X  as well as the super-actor X  X  belief sta tes is implemented. Algorithm 1 shows the process for bel ief update. Consider an email sent in the communication network . Let the average number of recipients in the To, Cc and Bcc fields be n n and n bcc , respectively. The sender and the super-actor will be able to perceive all the recipients of the mail and so will update a total of 2(n to +n cc +n bcc ) parameters (all ordered pairs of the form (sender, x) where x is an actor in the To, Cc and Bcc fields) in their belief states. Each Bcc recipient observes all recipients in the To and Cc fields as well as itself, hence it will update n +n cc +1 parameters. This makes a total of (n bcc updates for all Bcc recipients. The actors appearin g in the To and Cc fields will not observe the Bcc field actors as recipients. Hence they will update n to +n cc entries each in their belief states. Cc recipients. Also, each actor updates its counter of total emails observed, which results in another n to +n cc +n Thus, the email exchange causes an aggregate of, n bcc +2) parameter updates. Thus, the average complexity of belief update for an email exchange is O(n 2 ) where, n is the average number of recipients of an email. What an actor perceives regarding the communication network around it can be quite different from what is actua lly happening. Also, what one actor perceives about the social net work can be quite different from another actor X  X  perception. In this section, we present two types of analyses one can perform us ing the socio-cognitive network constructed above. The firs t is the divergence of actors X  beliefs from reality and the second is conflict in different actors X  beliefs. But first we define the concept of divergence or closeness between two beli ef states. Consider two actors A x and A y with belief states B time t . In computing the conflict between B x,t with B compare the beliefs in one set with the correspondi ng beliefs in the other set. For this the KL-divergence across th e expected Bernoulli distributions for the two respective beli efs is computed. The expected Bernoulli distribution for a belief is the expectation of the Beta distribution corresponding to that belief. If J(a,b) k,t is the Beta distribution, then the corresponding expected Bernoulli distribution can be denoted by E[J(a,b) which is obtained by normalizing the parameters of Beta distribution J(a,b) k,t . KL-divergence is an information-theoretic measure f or measuring directed divergence between two probabili ty distributions. KL-divergence of a probability distr ibution p from another distribution q , denoted as KL(q||p), is given as, It is an asymmetric measure and does not obey the t riangle law of inequality. To remove asymmetry, symmetric KL-di vergence KL sym (q||p) is defined as, DEFINITION 1. The divergence of one belief, express ed by the Beta distribution J(a,b) x,t , from another, expressed by J(a,b) at a given time t, is defined as, Where, According to [1] Bregman divergences between corres ponding features of two entities can be aggregated into a s ingle divergence (which can be taken as the divergence be tween the two entities themselves) by taking a convex combina tion of the Bregman distances for each of the features. KL-dive rgence is a Bregman divergence and different beliefs are analog ous to features of a belief state. Thus, we determine the divergence across two belief states by taking a convex combina tion of the KL-divergences across corresponding beliefs. DEFINITION 2. The divergence of a belief state B y,t belief state B x,t for two actors A y and A x respectively, at a given time t is defined as, Note that the numerator in div(B x,t ,B y,t ) sums up KL-distances for only those beliefs which belong to the intersec tion of the belief states B x,t and B y,t . The denominator is a normalization factor which ensures that div(B x,t ,B y,t ) does not depend on the number of intersecting beliefs since, the number of intersecting beliefs may vary for different pairs of actors. Thi s is equivalent to taking a convex combination of the KL-divergence s obtained for different beliefs in the belief state, where be liefs that are not in the intersection are given a weight of 0 and all the other beliefs are given a uniform weight of ) ( 1 The intersection of B x,t and B y,t contains the beliefs corresponding to only those communications for whic h both A and A y have observed at least one instance. For example, if both A and A y have observed at least one email from actor A being a recipient, then the belief corresponding to this communication is included in the intersection of B x,t either one of A x or A y has not observed even one instance of this communication then that belief would not be include d in the intersection of B x,t and B y,t . The following are the reasons for considering only those beliefs which are in the int ersection (of the belief states) rather than all of them. The com munication network will normally be quite sparse, i.e. out of all possible ordered pairs of actors only a few of them will act ually communicate. Therefore, the belief states of the ac tors being compared will be even sparser and the beliefs assoc iated with majority of communications will be derived from the prior values for both the actors. In such a case, it is desirable to consider only those beliefs for which both the acto rs have observed at least one instance. This is analogous t o determining document similarity, where one computes similarity based only on those words that are present in both the documen ts. Another reason for using the intersection of beliefs is tha t, if the whole set of beliefs is considered while computing diverg ence across two belief states, one implicitly assumes that the two actors are aware of the presence of all actors (since they ent ertain beliefs regarding every possible pair of communication) in the social network, which is quite unrealistic. An interpretat ion of the proposed divergence measure is as follows: Consider three actors A x , A y and A z . Suppose we want to determine how divergent are A y  X  X  and A z  X  X  belief states from that of A and A x have few beliefs in common, but low divergence for each of these few common beliefs then their belief state s are closer than those of A z and A x , who have a relatively larger number of common beliefs with greater divergence across them. The concept of divergence across belief states of two a ctors is an open issue and multiple interpretations and argumen ts are possible, many of which can be intuitively appealin g. However, not all of them can be captured with just one type of measure. If two actors have no beliefs in common, i.e. the i ntersection of their belief states is empty then we take the diver gence between their belief states to be infinity . Note that the divergence across two belief states is an asymmetric measure i.e. div(B In addition to being asymmetric the divergence of o ne belief makes it inconvenient to work with. Therefore, usin g this divergence measure we define a closeness measure wh ich we call a-closeness.
 DEFINITION 3 ( a-closeness ) . The a-closeness measure is defined as the level of agreement between two given actors A time t and is given by, Note that a-closeness between two belief states is symmetric and ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating minimum and 1 indicating maximum closeness between the two belief states. If two belief states have no beliefs in common then their a-close ness measure is 0 (corresponding to infinite divergence across the b elief states). The mean a-closeness across all ordered pairs of all (or a group) of actors is an indication of the general co nsensus among them. Lower values for mean a-closeness indicate lower levels of consensus, and higher values indicate higher lev els of consensus between the actors. The standard deviatio n across all actors, for a-closeness is indicative of the variance in the agreement of actors in the network. The second type of analysis on a socio-cognitive n etwork is to measure how close is an actor X  X  belief state to rea lity (i.e. belief state of super-actor). For this purpose we define t he r-closeness measure. DEFINITION 4 ( r-closeness ) . The r-closeness measure is defined as the closeness of the given actor A k  X  X  belief state B reality at a given time t and it is given by, Where B S,t is the belief state of the super-actor A S at time t. Similar to a-closeness, for r-closeness we consider only those beliefs present in the intersection of the actor X  X  and the super-actor X  X  belief states i.e. only those beliefs corre sponding to the communications for which the actor has observed at least one email. Philosophically the proposed r-closeness measure can be interpreted as the following: An actor who has accu rate beliefs regarding only few communications is closer to real ity than some other actor who has a relatively larger number of less accurate beliefs. Thus, depth of knowledge is prefe rred over breadth of knowledge. Note that r-closeness ( A k asymmetric divergence of A k  X  X  belief state from that of the super-actor. The measure r-closeness ranges from 0 to 1 , where 1 implies maximum closeness and 0 implies maximum divergence from reality. The mean r-closeness across all actors provides an aggregate measure of the general  X  X nowl edge X  or  X  X evel of perception X  in the network. The higher th e mean r-closeness, the more actors in the network know abou t other actors X  communications, i.e. the communication is t ransparent. A lower mean value for r-closeness indicates that actors generally have  X  X isperceptions X  regarding other act ors X  communications. This will normally be observed for a large social network consisting of various diverse groups , where it is difficult for a single actor to capture all the com munication in the network. The standard deviation for r-closeness across different actors indicates the variance in the leve ls of perception by them. Krackhardt [4] has explained that an actor X  X  percep tion of who communicates with whom is a function of his social position. In case of an organizational environment, it is believ ed that top actors in the formal organizational hierarchy have better knowledge about communication than lesser actors an d hence better perceptions about the social network . In other words, executive management has a better perception of the social network as compared to employees. Intuitively it is also expected that, the more communication an actor observes the better will be his/her perceptions regarding the so cial interactions occurring in the organization. The proposed r-closeness measure can be used to test such hypothes es, where the actor X  X  perception of reality needs to be quant ified. The a-closeness measures the similarity in social p erceptions of two actors. Therefore, one potential application of the a-closeness measure is to construct a graph of  X  X ho a grees with whom X . In such a graph, actors are represented by n odes and an edge is present between two actors only if their a-closeness measure is more than a certain threshold. It is an undirected graph. The  X  X ho agrees with whom X  graph has very us eful applications. Classical social network analysis tec hniques developed for social networks (or the socio-centric graph) can be applied on the  X  X ho agrees with whom X  graph, res ulting in a whole new class of analysis techniques with differe nt domain interpretations. For example, cliques are identifie d in order to determine strong communities or groups in a social network Analogous to this, cliques in the agreement graph r eveals clusters of actors with similar perceptions. The ac tors in each of these clusters may have similar roles or settings ( spatial proximity, same project or department). Other popul ar structures to look for are the  X  X ow tie X  (signifying articulat ion points),  X  X tar X  (central actors) and  X  X ridge X . Degree centra lity measures the importance of an actor based on its location in the social network. In the  X  X ho agrees with whom X  graph, degre e centrality can be used to determine the most import ant actor based on the number of other actors sharing its per ceptions. The Enron email corpus is the set of emails belongi ng to about 151 users, mostly senior management of Enron, excha nged between mid-1998 and mid-2002 (approximately 4 year s). The time period includes the Enron crisis which broke o ut in October 2001. The cleaned email corpus (no email at tachments and no integrity issues) is publicly available and can be downloaded from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/ . For our experiments, we chose to use a further clean versio n, in which duplicate, erroneous and junk emails have been remo ved. It is made available by Shetty and Abidi [7]. It consists of 252,759 email messages for the set of 151 users. For experi mental analysis, we chose to use the entire set of 151 use rs and only those emails which were exchanged between these 151 users. There were 20,311 such emails. To capture the dynam ic nature of the communication probabilities, time was divide d into uniform intervals of 1 month. At the beginning of e ach month, all Beta distribution parameters were assigned as t he default prior values. Figure 5 shows a plot of the number of emails excha nged among the 151 actors for each month. The time values rang e from 6, 1999 to 6, 2002. For the time periods before 6, 199 9 there were no emails exchanged among the 151 actors. It is obs erved that the email activity increased during the month of cr isis i.e. October, 2001. The r-closeness across actors is examined for two d ifferent months. We choose to compare the month of crisis, O ctober 2001 with a relatively normal month in the life of the organization, October 2000. For each of these month s, users were ranked in the decreasing order of r-closeness. Using the rankings for October 2000, we study two hypotheses (discussed in section 5.1) of interest to sociologists. H1. As one moves higher up the organizational hiera rchy, actors have a better perception of the social netwo rk. From the r-closeness rankings, it is observed that majority of the top positions were occupied by employees. In fact, out of the top 10 ranks only 2 of them at the 8 th and 10 th positions are executive management users. Other ranks were occupi ed by 6 employees, 1 in house lawyer and 1 user with an uni dentified designation. Some of the higher level executives we re communicatively inactive and therefore had very few perceptions. 
H2. The more communication an actor observes, the b etter will be his/her perception regarding the social network It was observed that even though some actors observ ed a lot of communication, they were still ranked low in terms of r-closeness. A reason was that these actors focus mor e on certain communications and less on the rest. As a result th eir perceptions regarding the social network are skewed towards these  X  X avored X  communications. Executive managemen t actors who observed a lot of communication showed a tenden cy for this  X  X kewed perception X  behavior. For October, 2000, the actors can be roughly divide d into three categories. The first category consists of actors w ho are communicatively active and observe a lot of diverse communications. These actors occupy the topmost pos itions in the rankings. They are followed by the second categ ory actors Ranks 
Total 100% Ranks Total 100% who also observe a lot of communication; however, t heir observations are skewed which in turn leads to skew ed perceptions. The third category consists of actors who are communicatively inactive and hardly observe any of the communication. These actors have low r-closeness va lues and are at the bottom of the rankings table. Table 1 su mmarizes the percentages of various actors (according to their f ormal positions) in the different ranges of r-closeness r ankings. The rankings for the crisis month Oct, 2001 are sig nificantly different from those of Oct, 2000. Note the increas e in the percentage of senior executive management level act ors in the top 50 ranks at the cost of some of the employees b eing pushed down. Thus, we observe a shift from the normal beha vior, indicating that communication perceived by most exe cutive management actors were more diverse and evenly dist ributed as compared to the skewed or no perceptions in Oct 200 0. A reason for this could be one pointed out in [3] viz . during the crisis month emails were exchanged across different levels of formal hierarchy in the organization. Table 2 summa rizes the statistics for r-closeness rankings for the month o f Oct, 2001.Figure 6 is a plot of mean r-closeness of all actors over time. An interesting pattern is that the mean r-closeness peaks during the crisis month of October 2001, indicating a general increase in the perception of social interactions d uring the crisis period. After the crisis period, mean r-closeness d rops down. Using the a-closeness measure we constructed the ag reement graph for the months of Oct, 2000 and Oct, 2001. An edge was drawn between two actors only if the a-closeness be tween them was more than a threshold of 0.95. A big organizati on like Enron, has many intra-organizational groups. Normal ly, the intra-group communication is high and the inter-gro up communication is low. Therefore, one can expect the  X  X ho agrees with whom X  graph to consist of many small, d isjoint components of users. This is precisely what we obse rve for the Oct, 2000 graph (Figure 7). Notice some of the structures i.e. cliques, bowties and stars which can be found in the graph. For Oct, 2001 the agreement graph (Figure 8) mainly consists of one large conne cted component, quite dense at the center and encompassi ng most of the actors. This indicates that the interaction bet ween employees during the crisis month crossed all boundaries whic h resulted in high overlap in their social perceptions. Figure 9 shows a plot of the mean a-closeness, acro ss all pairs of actors against time. Note the very low value for me an a-closeness in the month of Oct, 2000, as expected in a big organization like Enron having various intra-organi zation groups. There is a sharp increase in mean a-closene ss for the months of Oct, 2001 and Feb, 2002. Oct, 2001 was th e crisis month and Feb, 2002 was the month when the investig ations regarding the crisis occurred. Figure 9. Mean a-closeness across actors plotted ag ainst time The popularity of online social networks and the ab ility to collect gigabytes of unbiased social information about individuals provides a unique opportunity for compu ter scientists to develop new computational techniques for mining social network patterns. In this paper, we provide a computational model for modeling individual X  X  perce ptions of communication between other individuals in an email -based social network. Two new measures are proposed namel y r-closeness , to capture the divergence of an individual X  X  perceptions from reality, and a-closeness , to capture the difference of perceptions between different individ uals. An agreement graph is proposed to capture relationship s of similar perceptions between individuals. The use of these m easures to find interesting patterns from social network persp ective is illustrated using the Enron email data. Such comput ational techniques for socio-cognitive analysis can have wi despread impact in the understanding of social networks. A p ossible future research direction is to explore further ana lysis techniques (eg. centrality measures) for the agreement graph. Another future research direction is to extend the proposed approach eg. assigning different weights to a recipient based on whether the he/she is in To or Cc or Bcc fields.
