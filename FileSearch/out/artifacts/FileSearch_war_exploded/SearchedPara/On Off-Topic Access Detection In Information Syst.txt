 We focus on detecting insider access violations to off-topic documents. Previously, we utilized information retrieval techniques, e.g., clustering and relevance feedback, to warn of potential misuse. For the relevance feedback approach, we minimize the indicative features needed for detection using data mining techniques. We show that the derived reduced feature subset achieves equivalent performance to that of the previously derived full set of features.
 For each authorized user as in [5], a profile that defines their legitimate scope of interest is defined. This profile, which is either assigned or learned over a period of use, remains relatively constant for lengthy periods of time. Regardless of how the profile is determined, misuse is defined as a user querying the information retrieval database for material that is not relevant to their profile. Misuse detection, particularly as it relates to information retrieval systems, is only of recent interest. In [2, 3, 4], we presented approaches based on information retrieval and classification processing techniques to detect the misuse of information retrieval systems. Our efforts are content-oriented detection schemes as they evaluate the document content rather than its system characteristics, e.g., name, size, storage location, usage, etc. Note, we do not advocate using only content-oriented detection approaches; rather, we believe that such content-oriented approaches are complimentary to systems oriented approaches and should be used in conjunction with one another. Our evaluation results, however, strictly evaluate our content-oriented approaches in isolation. Clearly, combining our detection schemes with other schemes is likely to yield a lower rate of false alarm and a higher rate of detection. Other content-oriented misuse detections exist. Aleman-Meza, et al [1] describe an ontology-based solution to detect an insider threat, namely misuse. In [5], the authors propose the fusing of role based monitoring methods, social network analysis, and semantic content analysis to detect inappropriate information exchange. In both efforts, no evaluation results are presented. Finally, in [6], a natural language processing approach involving entity tagging for detecting misuse is presented. The authors favorably compare their approach against a described  X  X ag of words X  solution. The reported accuracy for their approach is similar to ours as reported in [4]; they use a different collection to evaluate their approach. As a misuse detection benchmark collection does not exist, using TREC data and queries, thirteen profiles were constructed. Readers are referred to [4] for a detailed description of the data, profile formation, and evaluation approach. In short, we consider five levels of ranking. We used four human evaluators to evaluate all 1300 cases. The distribution of levels is 40.9% for strong misuse L misuse L 4 , 49.3% for almost normal use L 2 or normal use L , and 9.8% for undecided L 3 . We calculated the recall and precision based on the above contingency matrix. Any query that actually is evaluated as misuse (L4 &amp; L5) and is predicted as such is considered a true alarm (TA). Similarly, an evaluated undecided (L3) query that is predicted as L4 and vice versa is likewise determined as TA. All other predictions of evaluated L4 &amp; L5 queries are defined as undetected misuse (UM). Likewise all queries predicted as L4 &amp; L5 that are not covered by the above are considered as false alarms (FA). All other cases are not considered, as they are legitimate use and are considered as such; these are marked as  X - X . The accuracy of the system is measured based on recall and precision and is defined as Recall = TA / (TA + UM), and Precision = TA / (TA + FA). RF2, as formally defined in [4], considers the absence of query terms in the profile, i.e., Q A ; the presence of the query terms in the query subset of the profile, i.e., Q q ; the presence of query terms in the feedback subset of profile, i.e., Q the absence of user query feedback terms from profile, i.e., F
A; the presence of user feedback terms in query subset of profile, i.e., F q ; and finally, the presence of user feedback terms in the feedback subset of the profile, i.e., F used a tuning parameter to adjust the emphasis of the query terms versus the feedback terms. Represented as a weighted vector, &lt;Q A , Q q, Q f-q , F A , F q , F elements are defined as in Table 2. Using a stratified ten-fold cross-validation technique and an SMO Support Vector classification approach, we experimented with query length and with various relevance feedback term selection configurations. Based on the contingency matrix presented in Table 1, the classification based misuse detector SMO achieves statistically equivalent or better accuracy than RF2, as shown in Table 3. D/D and D/T indicate the system accuracy for the long and short queries, respectively. For example, as shown, for D/D both RF2 and SMO have statistically equivalent recall, with 98.1% and 99.3%, respectively. The precision of SMO is statistically significantly better (82.7%) as compared to RF2 (79.4%), marked with  X + X . Similar observations are made for D/T. To find the minimum feature set that gives equivalent or better misuse detection accuracy, we generated all size k={5, 4, 3, 2, 1} subsets of the entire set of RF2 6 features. The results indicated that all three feedback-features F and F f-q are important features, i.e., relevance feedback of the query terms is a good indicator for detection; by their elimination from the feature set, the accuracy is degraded. Moreover, it is observed that F A is almost equivalent to the feature set {F q , F f-q }, i.e., feature set {Q A generally equivalent to {Q A , Qq, Fq, F f-q }. Feature set {Q Qq, F A } was shown to be the best and generally better than {Q A , Qq, Fq}, or {Q A , Qq, F f-q }. This feature set, {Q F }, was our ultimate minimized feature set with a statistically equivalent accuracy to the full feature set. All smaller subsets produced worse accuracy. The evaluations were done by comparing the results of the SMO detector based on the minimized feature sets (SMO-3) with the SMO detector with the entire RF2 6 features (SMO-6). The results (table 4) indicate that using less features, SMO-3, achieves a statistically equivalent accuracy to the original detector based on six features, SMO-6.
