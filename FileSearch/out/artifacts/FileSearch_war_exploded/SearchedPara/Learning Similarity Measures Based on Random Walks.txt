 We describe a novel learnable proximity measure based on personalized PageRank (also known as  X  X andom walk with reset X ). Instead of introducing one weight per edge label, as in most prior work, we introduce one weight for each edge label sequence . We show that this approach is advantageous for a number of real-world tasks, including querying graph databases, recommendation tasks, and inference in large, noisy knowledge bases.
 H.4 [ Information Systems Applications ]: Miscellaneous personalized PageRank, learning
The scientific literature can be represented as a graph of documents, terms, and meta-data, with edges correspond-ing to containment of a term in a document, authorship of a document by a person, and so on. One popular way of querying such a graph is via queries based on proxim-ity measures, such as personalized PageRank, also known as Random Walk with Restart (RWR).

We describe a novel learnable proximity measure based on RWR. Instead of introducing one weight per edge label, as in most prior work, we introduce one weight for each edge label sequence. In this model proximity is defined by a weighted combination of simple  X  X andom walk experts X , each corresponding to conducting a random walk constrained to follow a particular sequence of labeled edges.

Experiments on several tasks using graphs based on lit-erature from two subdomains of biology show that the new learning method significantly outperforms the prior meth-ods. We extend the method to support two additional types of experts to model intrinsic properties of entities:  X  X uery-independent experts X , which generalize the PageRank mea-sure, and  X  X opular entity experts X  which allow rankings to be adjusted for particular entities that are especially impor-tant.

We also present experiments in which we use this ap-proach to learn relationships in the ontology of NELL, a wide-coverage, large-scale information extraction system for web data. We show that these types of learnable  X  X roximity measures X  are general enough to accurately model a signif-icant number of real-world relations, and that they outper-form an alternative technique that learns to model relations based on more traditional logical rules.
