 Web Information System(WIS) fetches information resources and carries out the business processes via Web. However, associating with the application domain, WIS amount of data make WIS development a troublesome and complaining task. 
As a new approach for WIS Development, Ontology Driven Software Development (ODSD) [1] is proposed to overcome those difficulties. In ODSD, the software architec-ture and development process are all driven by formal domain models X  X ntology. The advantages of using ontology in WIS development are as following:  X  Clear specification: Ontology helps to confirm user's requirements and disci- X  High Reliability: Ontology describes the domain knowledge in both human un-can be used as the models or templates for WIS code generation. 
This paper presents a prototype for ontology driven WIS development: Web Infor-mation System auto-construction Environment(WISE). WISE aims to construct WIS automatically from user's view, and achieves good extensibility and maintainability. It discuss the models, techniques and tools of WISE. Model Driven Architectur e (MDA) is a kind of software development style. The cen-tral idea is to employ domain models on language like UML, and to generate code for specific applications or platforms. MDA based Approach for WIS Develop-specify the system operations in integrated style, the design and implementation about operation models are remained as future work. 
There are also some approaches based on ontology. Researchers have presented toWeaver [3] is also an ontology based approach to achieve high level support for Web site development. The site ontology is defined to provide fine-grained modeling sup-port for user interfaces and Web site structures. data than manipulation. They are too simple for enterprise oriented WIS development. From a user's view, WIS can be roughly seen in two perspectives: (a) the static enti-ties such as system structures, page presentations and the stored data, (b) the dynamic ontology are adopted in the paper. 
The details of domain ontology and behavior ontology can be found in author's The main concepts are as follows: information, Constraints is a set of constraints for the value. is a basic item on which the operation is triggered, Conditions is the execution condi-page to show the operation result. AddTag &gt;, where ComName is the name of the component, Elements is a set of ele-ments used for establishing the component, Operations is a set of operations defined component.

The above definition shows that a component could be applied to represent a whole ments child components are the inter nodes and basic items are the leaf nodes. In this operations are also encapsulated in components. As a result, the WIS ontology turns to the template for code generation. As a prototype for ontology driven WIS development, WISE is developed based on Figure 1: WISE Builder: Specify WIS Structures and Operations ontology and behavior ontology. Non-professional user can use it easily to build WIS XML interface. The details of WISE Builder are presented in our previous work [4][5] . WISE Mapper: Transform Behavior Ontology to Database Access Code SQL sentences are usually used in traditional developments to fulfill database access. By summarizing the similarity of user operations, WISE Mapper provides a method to automatically transform the operations of behavior ontology to backend database access code. 
Moreover, many operations need to manipulate data in multiple tables, these tables base, WISE Mapper can deduce the relationships among the tables, and automatically engaged in the design and development of WIS. Code Generator: Gen erate WIS Source Code Code Generator is used to generate source code based on the two kinds of WIS ontol-ogy. Theoretically, by switching the code generation rules, source code can be gener-prototype, WISE generates Java Beans as server-side code and JSP pages as the user interfaces. from the defined operations. Those functions will invoke SQL code generated by WISE Mapper to complete data operations. The total time to generate the JSP page, SQL code, operation functions and Java Bean for one page component is about 3-10 seconds. It is a new approach to develop WIS based on ontology. In order to carry out the WIS from user's view, we have proposed a prototype for ontology driven WIS develop-ment, the main contributions include:  X  Employing two kinds of ontology to specify WIS clearly;  X  Providing graphical tools to help ontology construction;  X  Transforming typical user defined operations to SQL code;  X  Automatically drawing the user interfaces of WIS from domain ontology, and 
The research of ontology driven WIS development is just beginning, there is much more work to be done, such as:  X  Refining the generated codes: There are also redundancies in the generated WIS  X  Managing business process: A navigation tool and workflow system will be de-Zhiyong Pan, Ying Ying, Ke Li.
