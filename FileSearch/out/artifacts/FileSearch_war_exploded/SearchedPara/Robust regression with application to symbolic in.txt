 1. Introduction
Regression analysis is one of the most widely used techniques in engineering, management and many other fields. The wide-spread availability of regression software has greatly expanded its application in recent years. A problem that is frequently encoun-tered in the application of regression is the presence of one or more outliers in the data. The outliers give valuable information about the fit of the model on data quality and they are indicative for atypical phenomena. Outlier observations are unusual obser-vations in a data set that substantially differ from the rest. Such data may have a strong influence on the statistical analysis, particularly in regression models based on least square estima-tors. In view of such potential impact on the fitted model, identifying outlying observations is an important concern of the regression model building process. That is, occasionally certain observations will have a disproportionate effect on the precision of the parameter estimates, and/or the overall predictive ability of the model.

Robust regression is an important technique for analyzing data that are contaminated with outliers. A robust estimation techni-que is essentially a method which tolerates the presence of data atypical points. This technique has been developed as an alter-native to least squares estimation in the presence of outliers. The primary purpose of robust regression techniques is to fit a model that describes the information in the majority of the data. This general definition implies that this technique should perform well on both messy data (with outliers) and on clean data (without outliers).

The statistical treatment of interval data has been considered in the context of Symbolic Data Analysis ( SDA ) which is a domain in the area of knowledge discovery and data management related to multivariate analysis, pattern recognition and artificial intelli-gence. The aim of SDA is to provide a comprehensive way to summarize data sets by means of symbolic data resulting in a smaller and more manageable data set which preserves the essential information, and its subsequent analysis by means of the generalization of the exploratory data analysis and data mining techniques to symbolic data. Symbolic data allow multiple values for each variable. Those new variables (set-valued, inter-val-valued and histogram-valued) make it possible to hold data intrinsic variability and/or uncertainty from the original data set as shown in Diday and Noirhomme-Fraiture (2008) .

The process of obtaining symbolic data starts with the extrac-tion of knowledge from data sets as in data mining process in order to provide symbolic descriptions. In practice, symbolic descriptions are mathematically modeled by a generalization process applied to a set of individuals described by classical data (categorical or quantitative values). According to Diday and
Noirhomme-Fraiture (2008) , overgeneralization problems can arise when extreme values are presented in classical descriptions and these values are in fact outliers or when the set of individuals to generalize is in fact composed of subsets of different distribu-tions. In classical data analysis, sometimes specialists after the identification of point outliers prefer to discard outliers before computing the line that best fits the data under investigation. In symbolic data analysis, a single interval outlier may represent an aggregation of a group of measurements that contain valuable information about the process being analyzed. Therefore, it is not recommendable to discard interval outliers because these obser-vations can cause great loss of information.
 prediction in the presence of atypical interval data. The outline of this work is as follows: Section 2 shows the motivation and related works for linear regression model with interval symbolic data. Section 3 describes the robust regression for interval data proposed in this paper. Section 4 carries out a simulation study and an analysis with two real-life interval data sets to show the performance of the introduced approach in comparison with a linear regression method for interval data of the literature of symbolic data analysis. Section 5 concludes the work. 2. Motivation and related works (midpoint) and range, interval outliers can be identified by investigating if there are point outliers in the respective midpoint and range data sets. Fig. 1 displays mushroom and football data sets in which interval-valued data outliers are presented. The mushroom data set ( Fig. 1 (a)) consists of 23 species described by two predictor interval variables that are stipe length and stipe thickness and the response interval variable that is pileus cap width. From this data set, we can observe that there are intervals that have unusual pileus cap coordinate. These unusual intervals are generated by the presence of point outliers in their midpoints and ranges. The football data set ( Fig. 1 (b)) provides information about professional football players in 20 French teams. Each player is described by the height and age independent interval variables and the weight dependent interval variable. Again, from this interval data set, we can verify that there are midpoint outliers that have unusual weight coordinate.

In the framework of regression models for symbolic interval data, several models have been introduced. Most of these models consider that their parameters are estimated by the minimization squared error criterion. Billard and Diday (2000) presented an approach to extend the classic linear regression model ( CLRM )to symbolic interval data by fitting the method of least squares to the midpoints of the interval valued data assumed by the interval variables. Billard and Diday (2002) proposed another approach that fits two independent CLRM on the lower and upper bounds of the intervals. Billard and Diday (2006) also included explanatory variables as well as hierarchical variable structure into symbolic regression framework. Maia and De Carvalho (2008) showed a least absolute deviation regression model suitable for manage interval-valued data and modeling based on regression L 1. Lima Neto and De Carvalho (2008) proposed the midpoint and range method for fitting the CLRM to interval valued data as an improvement in comparison with the methods presented in Billard and Diday (2000 , 2002) . Lima Neto and De Carvalho (2010) proposed an approach that fits a constrained linear regression model on the midpoint and range of the interval values in order to ensure mathematical coherence between the predicted values of the lower and upper boundaries of the interval. Concerning interval-valued time series, Maia et al. (2008) pre-sented approaches to interval-valued time series forecasting.
It is well known in the literature that a least squares model (as in Lima Neto and De Carvalho, 2008 ) is sensitive to outliers. In the previous work ( Fagundes et al., 2009 ), we presented a robust prediction method for symbolic interval data based on the simple linear robust regression methodology for intervals. Robust regres-sion uses the reweighted least squares method, where the weights are estimated iteratively along the process. In this case, the observations with large values residuals have small weights. Therefore, these values produce small influence in the estimation of parameters. The method is validated with a simulation scenario regarding interval outliers on midpoint.

Here, we propose a generalization of the previous work to the multiple linear regression methodology for intervals. In addition, definitions of interval outliers are given and simulation studies considering several scenarios of outliers on the midpoint and/or range are presented. This model consists of fitting two linear robust regression models to, respectively, the midpoint and range of the intervals. The prediction of an interval is based on a combination between the fitted models. The proposed method is compared with the model given by Lima Neto and De Carvalho (2008) since both methods do not assume distribution probability for errors. This fact allows to construct models more flexible to real data applications.

In the context of regression mode ls for interval data that assume probability distributions for the errors, Domingues et al. (2010) proposed a methodology of analysis for interval data based on a symmetrical linear regression. In this model the prediction of the lower and upper bounds of the intervals is not damaged in the presence of interval outliers defined by midpoint outliers. Lima Neto et al. (2011) introduce the bivariate symbolic regression model for interval data based on generalized linear model theory. Souza et al. (2011) introduced multi-class logistic linear regression models for the lower and upper bounds of the intervals conjointly and separately.
All these models of the literature of SDA can be applied to solve regression problems in different domains. For example, the software engineer area is common to estimate the time and/or cost taken for a project ( Bielak, 2000 ). The estimates are the basis of planning and particularly they are useful in schedule and budget development. The prediction based on interval data takes into account variability and this can become more flexible when making software planning. Some applications of regression model for software estimation can be found in Fakhrahmad and Sami (2009) for software defect estimation and in Oliveira (2006) and Leal et al. (2009) for software effort estimation. 3. Constructing weighted regression for interval data
The importance of taking into account the midpoint and range information in a linear regression model for predicting interval-valued data was demonstrated in Lima Neto and De Carvalho (2008) . In this model, the estimation procedure is based on the least square method that does not assume probabilistic supposi-tion on the error variable. However, this model may also suffer strong influence when there are interval outliers.

This section presents a robust regression model for interval-valued data considering two independent classic robust regres-sions on the midpoint and range of the intervals of a learning data set, respectively. The prediction of the lower and upper bounds of new intervals is based on information on the midpoint and range estimates.

Eq. (2) yields two independent minimization problems: 1. to find ^ b c , the value of b c that minimizes 2. to find ^ b r , the value of b r that minimizes Expressions for ^ b c and ^ b r cannot be obtained closed-form. Therefore, some iterative procedures can be used such as Newton
Raphson, BFGS (Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno) and Fisher scoring method and others. In this area, iteratively reweighted least squares method is the most used one ( Beaton and Tukey, 1974 ). The Fisher scoring method can be easily applied to get and ^ b r where the process for ^ b c and ^ b r can be interpreted as a modified least square. The iterative process for ^ b c and by the algorithm below.

There is a number of popular robust criterion functions and the robust regression method can be classified by the c function that controls the weight given to each residual ( Peter and Ronchetti, 2009 ; Rousseau and Leroy, 1987 ). For example, Tukey X  X  biweight does not weight large residuals as heavily as least squares.

Experiment results
To show the usefulness of the robust regression method proposed in this paper (here called IRR method), experiments with simulated interval-valued data sets in R 3 , each one of size 375, are now presented. Our aim is to achieve a comparison between this method and the linear regression method intro-duced in Lima Neto and De Carvalho (2008) (here called IR) that has been widely used to predict interval data. The performance assessment of these approaches will be measured in terms of the mean magnitude of relative errors in a hold out scheme. 4.1. Monte Carlo simulation
The experiments concerns of a sequence of algorithms orga-nized in the framework Monte Carlo simulation with 5000 replications. Monte Carlo simulation aims to perform the genera-tion of interval data sets containing outliers and the application of the methods for these data sets. Three different scenarios of data sets containing interval outliers are established. For each scenario, five different quantities (2%, 3% ,5%, 10% and 15%) of interval outliers present on the learning data sets are also adopted. The scheme of the Monte Carlo simulation is described as follows. Algorithm 2. Monte Carlo simulation.

Select n o 30 % elements randomly from the interval data set and compute range outliers by y r i  X  y r i n 9 n S y c with  X  i  X  1 , ... ,  X  n o 30 %  X  X  .
Interval outliers in R 3 are created based on the midpoint and important to take into account that an outlier hypercube needs to be much more farther than an usual point. Figs. 3 X 7 illustrate the interval data configurations 1 X 5 regarding different types of interval outliers, respectively. In Figs. 3 and 4 high variability on the midpoint of the hypercubes is shown. Fig. 5 shows a situation of high variability on the ranges of the hypercubes. Figs. 6 and 7 represent more complex scenarios in situations of high variability on the ranges and midpoints of the hypercubes. In Fig. 6 all the outliers on range are also outliers on midpoint of the hypercubes.
In Fig. 7 three situations of intervals outliers are considered: outliers on midpoint, outliers on range, and outliers on midpoint and range of the hypercubes. 4.2. Performance evaluation models is based on the mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE) that is given as MMRE  X  1 n containing interval outliers and IRR and IR methods. At each iteration of the Monte Carlo simulation, a regression model to a learning interval-valued data set is fitted. Thus, this fitted model is used to predict the interval values of the dependent interval variable of the test simulated data set. For each 100 replications, the average and standard deviation of the MMRE are calculated. deviation (in parenthesis) of the MMRE obtained for the IRR and
IR methods and the scenarios 1 X 5, respectively, regarding the time, the IRR method outperforms the IR method in all situations of outlier quantity and scenarios 1 X 5. In order to evaluate performance of these methods with interval data set without outliers, an experiment was carried out and the average and the standard deviation of the MMRE for the IR and IRR methods are, respectively: 0.03440 and 0.00235 and 0.03441 and 0.00236.
These results show clearly that the IRR and IR models have similar performance.

MMRE gain in the direction of the IR method. Note that, the relative gain is improved as the quantity of interval outliers increases in all the scenarios. As expected, the lowest values of relative gain are observed in all situations of the scenario 2 in which there are two groups of interval outliers on midpoints that are above and below the fitted surface, respectively. The highest values are obtained in all situations of the scenarios 1 and 4. The scenario 1 has interval outliers on midpoints only and the scenario 4 has interval outliers on midpoints but some of them are also outliers on ranges. These results emphasize that interval outliers on midpoint have weak impact in the reweighted least squares estimates furnished by the method proposed in this paper.

A unilateral statistical Wilcoxon test for paired samples at a significance level of 5% is then applied to MMRE average values calculated in the Monte Carlo simulation with 100 replications in order to compare the IRR and IR models. Moreover, to maintain consistency in the results, this procedure is repeated considering 50 different values for the vector of parameters  X  b 0 , b Algorithm 3 and the frequency of rejected null hypothesis is observed. Here, rejected null hypothesis means that the IRR model is better than the IR model null in terms of the MMRE average. In conclusion, the rejection ratio of the null hypothesis was 100% for all the situations and scenarios. This result indicates the superiority of the IRR model in comparison with the IR one. 5. Application with real-life interval-valued data sets
The IRR and IR models are applied on the mushroom and football interval data sets. For each interval data set, the MMRE is estimated based on leave-one-out method and the Wilcoxon test for paired samples at a significance level of 5% is then performed to compare the models. 5.1. Mushroom interval-valued data set
The mushroom interval-valued data set consists of a set of 23 species described by three interval variables. In this application, X is the stipe length, X 2 is the stipe thickness and Y is the pileus cap width. These mushroom species are members of the genus Agaricies . The specific variables and their values were extracted from the Fungi of California Species Index ( http://www.mykoweb. com/CAF/species_index.html ) and presented in Billard and Diday (2006) .

Fig. 8 displays midpoint and range data sets for this mushroom interval data set that was previously illustrated in Section 2 . After the fitting of the linear regression model to this data set, the residuals according to Definitions 3.1 and 3.2 were calculated.
From the results, we can observe that the interval observation 2 of this data set is a potential outlier on midpoint with 9 r c and the interval observation 4 is an potential outlier on midpoint with 9 r c In this data set, the average and standard deviation of the
MMRE for the IR and IRR methods are 0.0135 and 0.0198 and, 0.0091 and 0.0137, respectively. These results clearly show that the IRR model surpassed the IR one. 5.2. Football data set
The football data set provides information about professional football players in 20 French teams. In this data set, the two independent interval variables height and age have been consid-ered for predicting the dependent interval variable that is weight.
The data can be obtained at the address ( http://www.ceremade. dauphine.fr/touati/foot2.htm ) and presented in Billard and Diday (2006) . Fig. 9 displays midpoint and range data sets for this football interval data set that was also previously illustrated in
Section 2 . After the fitting of the linear regression model to this data set the residuals were calculated and the results highlighted that this data set has one interval outlier on midpoint with 9 r c deviation for the MMRE considering the IR and IRR regression methods are 0.0538 and 0.0369 and, 0.0438 and 0.0329, respec-tively. Again, the IRR method is better than the IR one and the Wilcoxon test supports the evidence that the average of the
MMRE for the IRR model is smaller than that for the IR one with 99% confidence. 6. Conclusion data sets is introduced. Different types of interval outliers are defined according to the presence of unusual midpoints and/or ranges of the intervals. The performance of the method is evaluated through a mean magnitude of relative error for inter-vals proposed in this paper. Experiments in the framework of
Monte Carlos simulation regarding several scenarios of simulated data sets containing interval outliers and applications with real-life data sets demonstrated the robustness of this method in comparison with a linear regression model for interval data that uses the ordinary least squares approach.
