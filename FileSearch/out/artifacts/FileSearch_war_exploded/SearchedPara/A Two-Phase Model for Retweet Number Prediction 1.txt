 Recently, there is a surge of social media. Many social network services have emerged, among which micro-blog service is a platform of sharing, spreading and 140 characters through Web or smart phones to share information timely. Micro-blog services gain worldwide popularity. As th e most popular micro-blog service, Twitter million messages every day. In China, Sina Weibo [2] had 503 million registered users before March 2013. 
In micro-blog network, retweet is the main way to spread messages. When a user posts a message, this message will be pushed to the user X  X  followers. When follow-ers see this message, he/she can choose to retweet the message, so the message will be an important indicator of the message X  X  influence. Predicting the retweet number of a the influence and the value of a tweet. What X  X  more, it contributes to controlling the spread of illegal information like rumors. 
There has been some studies [3,4,5,6,7,8,9 ,10] on the retweet prediction in micro-blog network. Many of them consider the problem as a two-classification problem, which predicts whether a message will be retweeted or not. Some studies [9] also treat it as a multi-classification problem. However, it is difficult to determine the threshold of multiple classifiers. There are a few works predicting the retweet number directly [10]. All these work can be considered as one-phase model as shown in Fig. 1(a). Due number with these one-phase models. Moreover, most of work focuses on English micro-blog services like Twitter and few studies are on Chinese micro-blog services. 
In this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of retweet in real Sina weibo data-set and point out it is not rational to directly do regression on training data due to the power law distribution of retweet number. Then we propose a two-phase model to phase, the model does regression on each category to predict the retweet number. The method without complex feature extraction. Extensive experiments on Sina Weibo data validate the above benefits through achieving better performances than one-phase models under different model settings. our two-phase model for retweet number prediction. Section 5 provides numbers of experiments to validate our model. Finally, we summarize our findings and conclude with Section 6. and user characteristics. Java et al. [11] introduce the basic functions and features of indicate that Twitter showed some power law distribution and small world properties. 
As retweet behavior is the key mechanism for information diffusion in micro-blog analysis of retweet in Twitter to explore how and why people retweet a tweet. Suh et al. [13] examined a number of features that might affect retweet, and they found that number of past tweets does not affect a tweet to be retweeted. Zhang Yang et al. [8] analyzed the importance of different features and investigate the feasibility of apply-ing classification method and proposed a feature-weighted model. Their model can predict a major fraction of tweets(nearly 86%). Bandari et al. [9] proposed a model to their retweet number 1-20, 20-100 and 100-2400. The model can predict ranges of popularity on Twitter with an overall 84% accuracy. Most of studies above focus on Twitter and few studies are on direct retweet number. Li Ying-le et al. [10] proposed a prediction model based on SVM algorithm with five features: user influence, user activity, interest similarity, the importance of micro-blog content and users X  closeness. The experiment with Sina Weibo data shows a good result that the predict accuracy is up to 86.63%. However, the features they extracted data. This section describes the dataset and features extracted from tweets. Then we analyze the characteristic of retweet behavior. 3.1 Dataset Preprocess work, retweet number of a tweet will change with time. For example, when a tweet is days. 3.2 Feature Description We extracted 28 features from the tweet and the tweet X  X  creator. Most of them can be creator X  X  influence. Feature Explanation Feature Explanation Feature Explanation Feature Explanation 3.3 Characteristic of Retweet Behavior We take a basic statistics analysis on retweet behavior of users. more than 30. The tweets that retweet number more than 1000 is less than 1%. 
For users, we compute the mean retweet number of each user (i.e., MRN). Fig. 2(c) Fig. 2(c), we can see that 63.1% of all users  X  X  mean retweet number is less than 1 and retweet number is more than 1000. Fig. 2(d) is also a cumulative distribution. We sort the mean retweet number according to descending order. From Fig. 2(d), the top 10% tweets come from 0.78% of users. 7.8% of all users post top 90% tweets. Obviously, only a small part of users can post tweets with high retweet number. number and number of tweets comply with the power-law distribution, and only a only a small percentage of them have the potential to post a tweet with high retweet number. weet number, and then describe our two-phase retweet number prediction model. 4.1 One-Phase Prediction Model phase prediction model in this paper. Here, we select four one-phase regression models: LeastMedSq[14], LinearRegression, M5P[15] and MultilayerPerceptron to set and the rest is test set. We draw the prediction result of four one-phase models in Fig. 3, which shows the relation of prediction values and real values. 
In Fig. 3(a), we can see LeastMedSq m odel predicts all tweet with a retweet than 1. Apparently, this model cannot solve the prediction problem. In Fig. 3(b)(c)(d), the prediction results are chaos. Even for most of tweets with retweet number 0 or 1, regression model cannot effectively predict retweet number. 4.2 Two-Phase Retweet Number Prediction Model Basic Idea Since the traditional one-phase regression model cannot solve the prediction problem, we propose a two-phase prediction model. The different between one-phase predic-tion model and two-phase prediction mode is shown in Fig. 1. 
From Section 3.3, we know that the retweet number is extremely unbalanced. This characteristic may lead some models to predict small values, which can get less error. And comparing with predicting whether a tw eet can be retweeted, predicting the ret-weet number is more complex. There are many features affecting the retweet number of a tweet. For example, the tweet is about special events, like earthquake or the tweet is created at a special time, like someone X  X  birthday. What X  X  more, the user may pay hardly predict very well. 
To reduce the influence of the two problems above, we propose two-phase model. We know that only a small number of user can post tweets with high retweet number from Section 3.3. If we can classify tweets into some classes based on retweet and Conquer X  strategy, our two-phase model can solve the unbalanced and complex problem in a way.

But there are two problems here: (1) How to select thresholds for classifying? (2) How many classes should we make? 
For the first problem, we should not ignore the unbalanced distribution of the data-ommend to use the 80/20 Rule to choose thresholds. For example, if we want to clas-sify tweets into 2 classes, the threshold will be retweet number of the tweet at the 80% position with a sorted datasets on retweet number. If we want to classify tweets into 3 classes, the positions will be 80% and 96%. Obviously, there are many other methods experiments. For the second problem, in Section 5, we also discuss the different influ-ence on our model with different number of classes. 
From Section 4.1, we have known training regression models directly on the whole dataset cannot get a good model. To prove the effectiveness of our two-phase model, we will still choose the same 4 regressions in Section 4.1 on experiments. Algorithm Framework Before describing the training algorithm, some notations are introduced in Table 3. In our two-phase model framework, if we classify tweets into n classes, we should train (n+1) models. The training algorithm and predicting algorithm are described in Algo-rithm 1 and 2. dataset is too large, we random select 1 million tweets on experiments. First, we con-duct experiments to select classification model. Then, we compare the prediction results of one-phase model and two-phase model. Last, we discuss some parameters of our model on experiments. 5.1 Effectiveness Experiments Classification Model Comparison Firstly, we compare the performances of different classifiers. We use the 80/20 Rule to classify tweets into three classes, the thresholds in our dataset is 5 and 118. So, the range of retweet number in three classes are 0-5, 6-118, 119-MAX. We choose 4 clas-sification models, RandomForest (RF), Logistic (LO), DecisionTree (DT) and Nati-veBayes (NB) to experiment. We random select 60%, 70%, 80% and 90% of the data-set as training set and the rest as test set. RandomForest model as our first phase model in the following experiments. Two-phase Model vs One-phase Model (LR), M5P and MultilayerPerceptron (MP). We use MAE and RAE to evaluate the results. They are defined as follows: retweet number. r m is the mean retweet number in training set. 
In order to fully test this model, we still random select 60%, 70%, 80% and 90% of the dataset as training set and the rest as test set to do experiments. From Table 5, we can see that two-phase model get a better prediction for each regression model. In the four two-phase models, the combination of RandomForest model and LeastMedSq model gets the best results. where m is a parameter to control the radius. when n p satisfies follows. number is 0 and 1. If a model predicts all tweets with a small number, it will get high prediction accuracy. To avoid this phenomenon, we random select an extremely tough test set in the rest of the 1 million training set. The test set has 100k tweets with ret-weet number 0-100, 100k tweets with retweet number 101-1000 and 100k tweets with retweet number more than 1001. In the following experiments, we use this set as test training set. From Fig. 4, we can see that two-phase models have a better performance than one-phase models. 5.2 Parameters Study Rule. Here, we test the influence of different class number on our model. We classify tweets into 2-6 classes with thresholds 5, 118, 766, 4143 and 16866. The details are in Table 6. In Fig. 5, with the increased number of classes, the model gets better predic-tion. But when the number is more than 4, the precision become stable. In previous experiments, we extract feat ure from the tweet X  X  creator and the tweet. To find out which kind of feature has more contribution to prediction, we use each of posts the tweet rather than the tweet itself. 
In Section 4, we say that there are other methods besides the 80/20 Rule to classify tweets. Here we discuss other methods based on the retweet number rather than pro-portion. Obviously, choosing 10^n as thresholds is an easy way. If we want 2 classes, can be average allocation on retweet number. First, we choose the maximum retweet number as MAX_R. Then if we want 2 classes, the threshold is MAX_R/2; 3 classes, are always some tweets that their retweet number like explosion. To avoid tweets like choose the MAX_R. We conduct lots of experiments to compare the three methods. From Fig. 7, we can see that no matter under what circumstances, the method of the 80/20 Rule gets the best prediction. Retweet behavior is the key mechanism for information diffusion in micro-blog net-work. Retweet number, which denotes how many times that a tweet can be retweeted, is good measurement of both influence in diffusion and value in market of a tweet. To predict retweet number of a tweet in Sina Weibo, we build a two-phase retweet num-ber prediction model. Experiments conducted on real dataset in Sina Weibo show that our two-phase retweet number model has better performance than traditional one-creator have more influence than the feature of tweet itself on retweet number.
