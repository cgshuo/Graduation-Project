 Recommender systems have recently grown in popularity both in e-commerce and in research. However, there is lit-tle, if any, direct evidence in the literature of the value of recommender systems to e-Businesses, especially relating to consumer packaged goods (CPG) sold in a supermarket set-ting. We have been working in collaboration with LeShop ( www.LeShop.ch ), to gather real evidence of the added busi-ness value of a personalised recommender system. In this paper, we present our initial evaluation of the performance of our model-based personalised recommender systems over the 21-month period from May 2006 to January 2008, with particular focus on the added-value to the business. Our analysis covers shopper penetration, as well as the direct and indirect extra revenue generated by our recommender systems. One of the key lessons we have learnt during this case study is that the effect of a recommender system ex-tends far beyond the direct extra revenue generated from the purchase of recommended items. The importance of maintaining updated model files was also found to be key to maintaining the performance of such model-based systems. H.3.5 [ Information Systems ]: Online Information Ser-vices X  Commercial services ; J.7 [ Computer Applications ]: Computers in Other Systems X  Consumer products Economics, Experimentation, Performance, Verification Case study, Business value creation, E-commerce, Perfor-mance evaluation, Personalisation, Recommender systems As a result of the increasing and ubiquitous use of the Internet, recommender systems are growing in popularity in e-commerce (e.g. www.Amazon.com , www.eBay.com , etc.). Concurrently, and most probably as a result, the area of personalised recommender systems has recently become an important research focus as well [1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 8, 5]. How-ever, most of the research in this area has thus far been focused on the development of new and improved recom-mender algorithms. Many companies who use personalisa-tion technologies (e.g. Amazon, e-Bay, etc.) often conduct their own unpublished evaluations in order to determine the value of these technologies to their business. However, there have been few published studies that provide direct evidence of the value of recommender systems to e-Businesses, apart from a very few exceptions, such as [7] based on the online bookstore Mitos (www.mitos.co.il). Furthermore, we have found no such published studies relating to consumer pack-aged goods (CPG) sold in a supermarket setting.

CPG items not only cover a wide and diverse range of cat-egories, but are also purchased repeatedly, and hence are dis-tinctly different to book sales (e.g. on Amazon.com, Mitos) and movie recommendations (e.g MovieLens). We have been very fortunate to collaborate with LeShop ( www.LeShop.ch ), who are pioneers in their field. Together, we have conducted a case study, in a real-world setting, with the aim of evalu-ating the business value of deploying a personalised recom-mender system for CPG items. LeShop ( www.LeShop.ch ) have been the No.1 e-grocer in Switzerland since 1998 and, a couple of years ago, became the first online grocery pure player in Europe to achieve operational break-even. We have been working in collab-oration with LeShop to gather crucial evidence of the real added value to the Business, of deploying personalised rec-ommender systems on their e-commerce site, in terms of the increase in sales revenue. The aim of our collaboration was to increase sales volume and share-of-wallet, by pro-viding LeShop X  X  customers with relevant and personalised recommendations in order to introduce them to items which they had not purchased before. The tools we utilized were in-store and checkout recommender systems, which were in-tegrated into the typical shopping session as illustrated by the flow-chart given in Figure 1.
 Figure 1: A flow-chart diagram of a typical shopping session on the LeShop.ch e-commerce site. The two recommender interfaces marked by the green boxes are shown in more detail in Figures 2 &amp; 3.
We started with the deployment of a checkout recom-mender system, which provided six recommendations, pre-sented to the shoppers at checkout, as illustrated in Figure 2, where the business sensitive information (descriptions, im-ages and prices of the products) has been blurred out. Figure 2: The user-interface of the checkout recom-mender system, where the three personalised rec-ommendations are highlighted by the red box.

The first three recommendations, generated by the LeShop system, were  X  X orgotten items X  (i.e. items the shopper usu-ally buys, but are not currently in the basket). The three recommendations on the right were the three items (not cur-rently in the basket) with the highest probability of pur-chase, given the contents of the basket. The probability of item I k , given the basket B containing items I 1 ,  X  X  X  , I where P ( I k ) (the prior probability of purchasing item I and P ( I i | I k ) (the probability of item I i being bought given that item I k was bought) are both computed using the fre-quency of past purchases in the training data. (For more details on the models, please see [8, 5]).

While the  X  X orgotten items X  model was regularly updated, we were unable to keep the personalised model updated reg-ularly due to various operational issues. As shown later in Section 3, this inadvertently provided us with evidence that the recency of the training data used to build the model files has an impact on model performance.
At the same time as the launch of the checkout recom-mender, LeShop also deployed an in-store recommender sys-tem, which initially provided up to eight within-category, non-personalised recommendations, selected by category man-agers. In our most recent deployment, in October 2007, we personalised two of these in-store recommendations, via our model-based system [8, 5]. The in-store recommendations are presented to the shoppers at the bottom of each cate-gory home page, as illustrated in Figure 3, where once again the business sensitive information has been blurred out. Figure 3: The user-interface of the in-store recom-mender system, where the two personalised recom-mendations are highlighted by the red box.

Here, the model-based personalised recommendations are the first two recommendations on the top-left. While the personalised recommendations could be any item available in the store, the programmed recommendations were restricted to within-category items. For example, on the  X  X airy X  cat-egory home page, the personalised recommendations could be a fruit and a light bulb, whereas the programmed recom-mendations would all be dairy items such as milk, butter and cheese. Furthermore, the programmed in-store recommen-dations were regularly updated by the category managers, while the model files that generated the personalised recom-mendations were updated only once, since its launch. The results of the model update can be seen in Section 3.
In this section we present the results of an initial perfor-mance evaluation of our live model-based personalised rec-ommender systems between May 2006 and January 2008, with particular focus on their added-value to the business.
Following the launch of the checkout recommender on the 5 th of May 2006, the model files were updated using the lat-est data on the 20 th of October 2006, 7 th of March 2007, 22 of May 2007, 2 nd of October 2007 and the 20 th of November 2007. The In-Store recommender model files were updated only once, on the 28 th of November 2007, since its launch on the 2 nd of October 2007. We use red dotted vertical lines in Figures 4, 5 &amp; 6 to indicate the time points at which the model files were updated.
We begin with an analysis of how the use of each Rec-ommender System spread over time. This is the most fun-damental measure of the value of a recommender system, because no matter how good the recommendations are, if the users (in the case the shoppers) do not use the system it will not be able to generate any value for the Business. Figure 4 shows the penetration of each of our recommender systems over time. The measure of penetration (i.e. the units on the y-axis) used, is the proportion of shoppers who accepted at least one of our recommendations, represented as a percentage of all shoppers who bought at least one item from LeShop, both of which were computed up to and in-cluding the month in consideration.
 Figure 4: Penetration of our recommender systems over time. The red dotted vertical lines indicate the time points at which the model files were updated.
Here we see that updating the checkout recommender model files consistently resulted in an increase in the num-ber of new shoppers using the recommender system. The in-crease in penetration resulting from a model update was on average 0 . 26%. Furthermore, the usage of the recommender systems continues to grow. This could be becuase the shop-pers are increasingly becoming more comfortable with the new technology. Unlike that of the checkout recommender, the penetration of the in-store recommender is increasing quite rapidly since its launch. We believe this is because the exposure of the in-store recommender is, on average, nine times that of the checkout recommender. It is also interest-ing to see that there are a number of users who use only one of the recommenders, since the total penetration is greater than the penetration of either of the recommenders. This may be attributed to the fact that different shoppers have different needs fulfilled by different recommenders.
Next we analyzed the direct extra revenue generated by the recommender systems. The direct extra revenue is sim-ply the total amount of money shoppers spent on purchasing items recommended by our systems. A plot of the direct ex-tra revenue computed on a monthly basis and presented as a percentage of LeShop X  X  total monthly turnover is given in Figure 5.
 Figure 5: The monthly direct extra revenue gen-erated by our recommender systems, presented as a percentage of the total monthly turnover. The red dotted vertical lines indicate the time points at which the model files were updated.

An important lesson to take away from this analysis is that it is imperative to keep the model files updated, in order to maintain a steady flow of direct extra revenue. We see the performance of the model-based systems fall-off very rapidly until they are updated again using the latest data. We also see that, given its higher exposure (on average  X  9 times higher), the in-store recommender is able to generate significantly more direct extra revenue than the checkout recommender. It is also important to note that although our highest achieved percentage value of 0 . 30% seems like a small amount, when you consider the magnitude of the monthly turnover of a successful e-commerce business like LeShop, the actual value generated is substantial.
The indirect extra revenue generated by our recommender systems comprises two components. The first component is the total amount of money the shoppers spend on re-peat purchases of items first introduced to them by our recommender systems. The second component is the total amount of money the shoppers spend on purchases of non-recommended items from categories first introduced to them (via other recommended items from the same category) by our recommender systems. In both cases a particular pur-chase contributes to the indirect extra revenue only if the purchased item was not recommended to the shopper during the current shopping session . We refer to this as the  X  X ndirect X  extra revenue, as this extra revenue was not generated directly via the purchase of recommended items, but instead because of the influence of the recommenders. As shown in Figure 6, the indirect extra revenue generated by our recommenders is substantial.

Here we note that within a few months, the indirect extra revenue overtakes the direct extra revenue and then remains consistently above it. Furthermore, even when the model files are out-of-date and, as a result the direct extra revenue falls-off rapidly, the indirect revenue remains relatively sta-ble. We also see that the indirect extra revenue substantially Figure 6: The direct, indirect and total extra rev-enue generated by our recommender systems. The red dotted lines indicate the time points at which the model files were updated. (at least by 66% and on average by 336% 1 ) increased the total extra value generated by our recommender systems.
If we take a closer look at the categories new to LeShop X  X  shoppers, which were introduced to them by our recom-mender systems, the top ten categories in terms of extra revenue generation turned out to be Delicatessen (26.02 %), Dairy (19.67 %), Fruits &amp; Vegetables (17.12 %), Butcher (9.04 %), Snacks (8.17 %), Hygiene (4.66 %), Household (4.01 %), Wine (2.26 %), Condiments (2.10 %) and Canned Food (2.04 %) 2 . As we can see the top four categories on this list contain fresh produce items, indicating that rec-ommender systems may be a useful means of overcoming shopper resistance to buying fresh produce on-line.
Recommender systems have recently grown in popularity both in e-commerce and as a research theme. However, most of the literature in this area has been focused on algorithm development, and there is little, if any published direct evi-dence of the value of recommender systems to e-Businesses, especially relating to consumer packaged goods (CPG) sold in a supermarket setting. Over the past few years, we have been working in collaboration with LeShop to gather such evidence. We deployed in-store and checkout recommender systems on LeShop X  X  e-commerce site, to introduce their cus-tomers to items, which they had not purchased before. In this paper, we presented our initial evaluation of the live performance of these recommenders between May 2006 and January 2008, with particular focus on their added-value to the business. Our analysis looked at penetration (i.e. how the use of each recommender system spread over time), and the revenue generated directly from purchases of the recom-mended items. An important lesson learnt from this anal-ysis is the importance of keeping the model files updated, in order to maintain a steady flow of direct extra revenue, with the performance falling-off very rapidly between model updates.
Considering only the months during which the direct extra revenue was above 0 . 01%
Here the percentage values are the contribution of each category to the extra revenue.

Another key lessons we have learnt during this case study is that the effect of a recommender system extends far be-yond the direct extra revenue generated from the purchase of recommended items. Our analysis shows how our recom-menders generated a substantial amount of additional rev-enue to the business by introducing shoppers to new cate-gories from which they then continued to purchase. A closer analysis indicates that recommender systems may be a use-ful means of overcoming shopper resistance to buying fresh produce on-line. We are carrying out further analysis on the data we have gathered from this case study. However, even the limited results of our initial evaluation presented here, clearly shows the added-value of personalised recommender systems to e-Businesses.
