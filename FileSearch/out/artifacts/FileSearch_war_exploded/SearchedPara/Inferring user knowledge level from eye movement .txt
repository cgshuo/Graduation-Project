 1. Introduction
While users frequently seek information about something they do not already know ( Belkin, 2000 ), an essential aspect of all information behavior is that one must use existing knowledge to make progress towards the task goal. Identifying rele-vant knowledge and using it to guide search in a problem space is a fundamental aspect of models of cognition ( Anderson, for that information to be acquired by reading.

The only way to obtain information visually is by repeated gaze on a location. One must also allocate attention during this process and there is still much that is unknown about how the process and mechanism of attention works ( Wright &amp; Ward, 2008 ). In reading, it has been shown that one can distinguish between eye movements that are engaged in information eye movement patterns shows observations of eye fixations on words can be coupled with the process of acquiring the meanings of the words ( Rayner, 1998 ). It is possible to not only understand what information the person has engaged with during search interactions, but also to learn important details of how it has been processed. Previous work shows this can be their experience of the difficulty of the task ( Cole, Gwizdka, Liu, &amp; Belkin, 2011a ).  X 
Analysis of eye measurements is particularly attractive for study and modeling of information search behavior because research shows they are connected directly with mental states. In particular, the acquisition of the meaning of a word or phrase is revealed by real time measurements of eye fixations ( Rayner, 1998; Staub, White, Drieghe, Hollway, &amp; Rayner, 2010 ). Analysis of eye movement patterns, unlike other observations of information search behavior, allows for unmediated measurement of user mental states that have an essential role in the search process.

Our research goals include understanding the value of predicting domain knowledge to improve information retrieval system performance. For broad practical application, one needs to learn not only how to detect domain knowledge but also how that can be accomplished in a domain independent manner. Implicit detection techniques are desirable and so we have studied the problem of inferring domain knowledge by concentrating on observable behaviors.

Cognitive modeling of a person X  X  existing knowledge is challenging. Consistent with the research showing that the time to acquire word meaning depends on existing concept knowledge (c.f. Kieras, 1981; Foss, 1982 ), the cognitive effort due to reading experienced by a user during search may be expected to reflect, in part, their existing domain knowledge. This paper presents results of a user study showing correlations between individual cognitive effort features and a person X  X  level of do-main knowledge. It also constructs regression models based on the cognitive effort features to explore the possibility of pre-dicting a user X  X  level of domain knowledge based on real-time measurements of their eye movement patterns. 2. Related work 2.1. Implicit detection of domain knowledge during search
It is reasonable to think behaviors can be used to infer user knowledge levels without the need to consider the content of documents or queries. Domain knowledge or expertise has been shown to affect search behaviors. Users with low domain knowledge are found to have more non-productive queries ( Allen, 1991 ), use less efficient concepts and make more query reformulation errors ( Wildemuth, 2004 ), and resort to less effective search strategies ( Hembrooke, Granka, Gay, &amp; Liddy, 2005 ). Users with intermediate levels of knowledge about their task fail to select available documents of which they have the most knowledge as compared to users with high or low levels of domain knowledge ( Cole, Zhang, Belkin, Liu, &amp; Gwizdka, 2011c ). High level information search behaviors, such as dwell time, selected document ranks, and query length, have been used to construct a domain knowledge model ( Zhang, Cole, &amp; Belkin, 2011 ). 2.2. Eye movements in search
In text-based interactive information retrieval (IIR), information acquisition is mediated by eye movement patterns in and are well-suited to represent the textual information acquisition process during search tasks.
 Eye tracking has received considerable attention as a new source of data for research into the information search process.
Much of the work in information science using eye tracking data has concentrated on eye fixations, for example to indicate ing has identified patterns of processing documents, for example an  X  X  X  X  X  shape reading pattern for a search engine result page (SERP) and other scanning patterns ( Granka, Feusner, &amp; Lorigo, 2006 ). Granka, Joachims, and Gay (2004) and Lorigo et al. (2008) studied the number of fixations, their duration and time on task in a user study of searches with the Yahoo! and Goo-gle search engines. Eye movements during different types of information retrieval activities have been investigated by look-the usefulness of social navigation clues to users performing web searches ( Loboda et al., 2011 ). 2.3. Eye movements and reading
Eye movement patterns are cognitively controlled and reading patterns have long been studied ( Rayner, 1998 ). There are many results relating eye movements to semantic and cognitive processing states. Models of the reading process have been developed that explain observed fixation duration and word skipping behaviors.
 The E-Z Reader model is a cognitively-controlled, serial-attention model of reading eye movements ( Reichle, Rayner, &amp;
Pollatsek, 2004 ). It takes word identification, visual processing, attention, and control of the oculomotor system as joint determinants of eye movement in the reading process. The saccade (i.e., very fast movement of eyes during which eyes do not acquire any visual information) to the next word is programmed while the text in the current fixation is being cog-nitively processed.

There are several stages of text processing during fixations. In the E-Z Reader model it is supposed that the controller of eye-movement is triggered by completion of an early word identification stage, called the familiarity check, and the shift in attention to the next word selected takes place only after full lexical access is achieved. The mean minimum time to acquire the full meaning of a word is 151 ms ( Reingold &amp; Rayner, 2006 ) and the mean minimum time for the familiarity check is a
If that time window is exceeded, the pending saccade will be executed when the cognitive processing of the current fixation is completed. Eyes remain fixated during the lexical processing period independently of the stimuli, for example even if the explains why observations of eye movements are connected directly with a person X  X  mental states of information acquisition during search.

If the next word is recognized during the labile stage, the programmed saccade is canceled and a saccade to the next word is programmed. Frequently, a person is able to infer enough meaning to permit planning a saccade word target that is several words away from the current fixation. The E-Z Reader model does not account for higher-order cognitive processes and does not address language comprehension and conceptual processing, such as deductive or analogical reasoning ( Reichle et al., 2004 ). 2.4. Reading eye movement pattern analysis and search
Buscher, Dengel, and van Elst (2008b) presents an eye tracking model of information acquisition processing by labeling sequences of fixations as reading that is more intense or engaged,  X  X eading X , vs. a less engaged interaction,  X  X kimming X . Their reading model algorithm uses the position of the succeeding fixations to label the reading segments. They then show the labeled sequences can be exploited to select words that improve query expansion quality.

In previous work we have demonstrated relationships between eye movement patterns and task and page types ( Cole et al., 2011b, 2010 ). We have implemented a model of reading based on empirical research into the reading process ( Reichle et al., 2004 ) and used it to develop several measures of cognitive effort due to textual information acquisition. These cogni-tive effort measures are correlated with user task difficulty assessments and with objective task effort measured using high level behaviors, such as number of documents examined and document use ( Cole et al., 2011a ). 2.5. Eye movements and cognitive effort during reading
Reading process research has identified several observable indicators of cognitive effort associated with reading eye movements. Cognitive effort in reading arises from accessing word meanings, phrase and sentence parsing, and text compre-hension. Each of these depend upon an individual X  X  domain knowledge. Research has connected these aspects of processing effort with properties of reading eye movements.

Indications of reading effort can be inferred from eye movement patterns. An obvious one is reading speed. Reading speed is required to comprehend the concepts involved ( Morris, 1994 ). Sentence parsing can also impact reading speed.
The cognitive processing needed to acquire word meaning and its meaning in context is also indicated by fixation dura-tion. Rayner, Chace, Slattery, and Ashby (2006) show text comprehension processing has some observable effects in eye movements. Conceptually difficult text passages involved more fixations and slightly longer mean fixation duration.
As explained above, word skipping during reading sequences depends on the ability to recognize words. This controls fix-ation spacing. Fixation spacing is also associated with cognitive processing constraints. Perceptual span is the amount of text processed as a unit. Studies of reading in different orthographic systems show perceptual span describes a property of hu-
Liu, 1998 ) compared with about 15 characters in languages like English. There are differences in perceptual span between phoneme-encoded systems, such as Hebrew, and character-based systems, e.g. English and Dutch. Pollatsek, Rayner, and
Balota (1986) found that bilingual Hebrew and Dutch speakers changed their perceptual span when switching between the two languages. What is striking in these results is that across the orthographic systems, approximately the same number of concepts can be expressed in the different perceptual spans observed.

Carpenter and McDonald (2007) propose a model of neural-decision making for saccade programming that explains per-ceptual span as a function of competing cognitive mechanisms. Increased semantic processing requirements result in longer fixations. Increasing word familiarity increases the rate at which the mechanism reaches the next saccade decision thresh-old, but fixation proximity to the previous fixation increases the probability of executing the programmed saccade to the next word. The result is that when the fixation spacing is short, processing of even familiar words will tend not to increase the average fixation spacing. So a decreasing perceptual span is expected to correlate with unfamiliar words and conceptu-ally difficult passages.

Reading sequences commonly include retrograde saccades, where the next eye fixation returns to a previous point in the text passage. It is a common feature of reading eye movement sequences and can have an incidence of 10 X 15% of the total fixations in the reading sequence ( Boland, 2004 ). The number of regressions in a reading sequence, and the fixation durations of the regression fixation have been associated with conceptual complexity, the difficulty of reading passages, the resolution observed to regress more frequently in text passages as compared to non-experts ( Boland, 2004 ).
 2.6. Summary
There is ample evidence that the user X  X  level of domain knowledge affects their search behavior, so it is reasonable to think that observation of search behaviors can reveal the knowledge level of users. Eye movements are a low level behavior and their observable properties are determined by the user X  X  interest and cognitive processing of the words. Of particular importance is the fact that eyes fixate until the meaning of the word(s) is acquired.

The cognitive nature of information interaction connects cognitive effort measurements derived from eye movements with user domain knowledge. The measures are closely associated with semantic processing, such as acquisition of word meaning, which in turn are correlated with a user X  X  level of knowledge. Vocabulary knowledge is related directly to concept knowledge via internal representation of words indicating concept features or as the mechanism for accessing these con-cepts. This essential link between the meaningfulness of words and concept formation and use is a core aspect of research into the nature of concepts (c.f. Katz, 1972; Fodor, 1975; Armstrong, Gleitman, &amp; Gleitman, 1983; Landauer, 2002 ). Despite the on-going difficulty of fixing the precise relationship between psycholinguistics and concept access and use, knowledge of vocabulary is well-accepted as an indicator of concept knowledge.

Observable eye fixations can be associated with semantic and cognitive processing during reading in ways that relate di-rectly to cognitive effort. Word familiarity, sense disambiguation in context, and the conceptual difficulty of a text passage can all be related to eye movement features, specifically the duration and spacing of eye fixations, and fixation sequence pat-terns. Our previous work investigated relationships between the user X  X  task type and transitions in reading strategies from scanning to extended reading and differences in the influence of page types (search results pages vs. content documents) on text acquisition and page processing when different tasks are being executed. This paper extends previous work by inves-tigating eye movement-based measures of the cognitive effort due to reading, and showing correlations with the user X  X  level of domain knowledge. 3. Methodology 3.1. Experiment and participant knowledge representation
We conducted a user study to explore the effects of differences in domain knowledge on search behaviors. Undergraduate and graduate students ( n = 40) in biology-related programs were recruited to an on-campus usability laboratory. They read and signed a consent form and filled out a background questionnaire that solicited demographic information, computer experience and experience in search. In the following sections we explain how their domain knowledge was elicited and then describe the experiment logging system and the search tasks they performed. 3.1.1. Procedure and calculation of knowledge levels
Domain knowledge representation is difficult. Asking people to self-assess their knowledge of some domain is difficult because of vague boundaries, understanding of the terms and projection of the scale for the assessment. How much differ-ence is needed to say one knows a bit about a concept or has moderate knowledge? We approached this problem by select-ing a comprehensive domain concept representation system and constructing a self-rating scale with  X  X right line X  anchors.
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) is a controlled vocabulary developed by the National Library of Medicine for indexing some entanglement). An attraction of the MeSH system is the detailed and comprehensive coverage over the broad biomedical domain, including biology, medicine, genetics, etc.

We used terms from three MeSH categories that corresponded to the search tasks used in the study. This use of rating controlled vocabulary terms has been employed previously in other studies to measure a user X  X  domain knowledge ( Zhang, Anghelescu, &amp; Yuan, 2005 ) and proved to be an effective approach for the purpose of studying users of IR systems.
One strength of the study design is that participants made a series of independent judgments about their knowledge of specific concepts in addition to an overall judgment about their knowledge of the domain (say genomics) and the task itself.
We use only the specific concept judgments in this paper. In other work, we compared the collection of specific MeSH con-cept judgments by the participant with their general assessment of domain and task knowledge and found correlations, but also significant variances ( Cole et al., 2010 ).

In constructing the self rating scale we were concerned to have anchors the could elicit the same judgments from people and reduce the variance inherent in subjective assessments. One such anchor is clear  X  people can be relied upon to deter-mine whether they know nothing about a specific concept. Likewise, it is reasonable to think that people can say when they have some idea of the concept without claiming they have a significant level knowledge of which they are confident. Relative levels of knowledge are more difficult to pin down. We chose to use a performance-like measure as another anchor. It seems plausible people can project whether they are confident enough about their knowledge of a concept to explain that concept to someone who is not an expert. While self-deception objections can be raised, this projected performance measure helps people to distinguish between having high knowledge of concept and feeling they have real expertise. Using these bright line anchors we fashioned a five point Likert scale (1 X  X  X o knowledge X , 2 X   X  X ague idea X , 3 X  X  X ome knowledge X , 4 X  X  X igh knowledge X , 5 X  X  X an explain to others X ). The middle point of  X  X ome knowledge X  is not anchored although it can be confidently selected by exclusion of  X  X ague idea X  and  X  X igh knowledge X .

Before the experiment, participants rated their knowledge of 409 genomics-related MeSH terms from the three MeSH cat-egories that corresponded to the search tasks used in the study. It took from 20 to 40 min to complete the rating process. This methodology of rating controlled vocabulary terms was used in a previous studies to measure a user X  X  domain knowledge ( Zhang et al., 2005 ), where it proved to be an effective approach for the purpose of studying users of IR systems.
The participant term ratings were processed to make a single measurement of their domain knowledge. The participant domain knowledge (PDK) was calculated as: where k i is the term knowledge rating and i ranges over the terms. m is the total number of terms rated (max = 409) and t 1 if rated and 0 if not. The sum is normalized by a hypothetical expert who rated all terms as  X  X an explain to others X .
The PDK measurements were then fashioned into a Euclidean distance matrix and clustered with Ward X  X  hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique, which uses a minimum variance method to find compact, spherical clusters. Three well-distinguished levels of knowledge were identified in the participant group: high domain knowledge (HDK) ( n = 6), intermediate domain knowledge (IDK) ( n = 24), and low domain knowledge (LDK) ( n = 8).

After rating their domain knowledge the participants were led through a training task to gain familiarity with the search system. The training task was a very easy task taken from the 2004 TREC Genomics track. After completing the training task, participants were asked to do four out of five tasks, with two tasks alternated during the study. Before each task, the par-ticipant filled out a questionnaire asking about their familiarity with the task using a seven point Likert scale (1 X  X  X ot at exit questionnaire was administered after they performed all of the tasks. Each participant was paid $25 for completing the experiment. 3.1.2. Tasks
The search tasks were taken from the 2004 TREC Genomics track ( Hersh et al., 2005 ), which were ad hoc retrieval tasks information tasks for research professionals. These types of search tasks are difficult even for medical librarians ( Liu &amp; Wacholder, 2008 ).

A simulated work task approach ( Borlund, 2003 ) was used to design the task presentation to the participants. The tasks were presented without changes from the TREC track. Participants were asked to find and save all of the documents useful for answering the task questions. Five tasks were used in the experiment. The tasks, with TREC topic numbers noted, as pre-sented to the participants were:
Category I: Genetic processes.
Category II. Genetic phenomena.
Category III: Genetic structure.
Each participant did four tasks. All of the participants completed the tasks 2, 7, and 45. Twenty participants did topic 42 and the other twenty did task 49. The presentation order of the tasks was randomized in a blocked Latin Square design. We switched the tasks halfway through the experiment because we were interested in eliciting a range of information behaviors looking for knowledge effects and task 42 was observed to be too easy for the participants for this purpose. The tasks were presented in a blocked and counter-balanced design with task 49 substituted for task 42 at the half-way point of the study. In experiment. The questions presented to the participants were the TREC genomics track descriptions including the need and context, as shown above.

We implemented a search system using Indri from the Lemur toolkit.
Genomics collection, a 10-year, 4.5 million document subset of the MEDLINE bibliographic database ( Hersh et al., 2005 ). We participants X  interactions with the computer system, including eye gaze, were logged using a Tobii T-60 eye tracker (1280 1024 @ 60 Hz). We used eye fixation data as calculated by the Tobii Studio software. Technical reasons prevented anal-ysis of two participants. 3.2. Eye movement data processing 3.2.1. Representing a user X  X  experience of information acquisition due to reading
We implemented a line-oriented reading model based on the E-Z Reader model ( Reichle et al., 2004 ) and used the algo-rithm to process the location and duration of participant eye fixations as logged by the Tobii eye tracker. First we used a minimum fixation duration of 113 ms to select eye fixations that were likely to result in word meaning acquisition. The read-ing model was then used to group these lexical fixations into reading sequences ( Fig. 2 ). These reading sequences are taken to represent the user X  X  experience of information acquisition via reading.

Our algorithm for classifying reading sequences is line-oriented. Eye movement data from a user reading several lines of text in a sequence would generate a representation of several reading sequences. This is a limitation of our algorithm. Addi-tionally, our algorithm does not attempt to learn font sizes and physical line spacing on a page to decide if two reading se-quences should be unified. The impact of this limitation is mitigated, however, because much of information search reading consists of rather shorter units of text engagement, at the level of phrases and sentences ( Granka et al., 2006 ). 3.2.2. Calculating cognitive effort due to reading Several cognitive effort measures based on reading fixation sequences have been developed (see Section 2.5 for details).
Studies of reading employ these measures but they have not been construed by others as cognitive effort, per se. The mea-sures are: fixation duration in excess of the minimum required for lexical processing, the existence and number of regression fixations in the reading sequence, the spacing of fixations in the reading sequence, and reading speed, as defined as the length of text acquired per unit time.
 3.2.3. Lexical access duration excess (LADE)
Fixation duration is an indicator of the cognitive processing required to establish the meaning of the word, and the mean-ing of the word in context. The mean minimum time to acquire the meaning of a word is 151 ms ( Reichle, Pollatsek, &amp; Ray-ner, 2006 ). We use a conservative figure of 113 ms as an absolute minimum time for processing a word based on the mean minimum time for the familiarity check ( Pollatsek et al., 2006 ). We define the lexical access duration excess (LADE) as the additional observed fixation duration beyond this familiarity check minimum. 3.2.4. Regressions ationalize a regression measurement as a count of the regression fixations in a single reading sequence consisting of at least four fixations. 3.2.5. Perceptual span
Perceptual span reflects the spacing of the fixations in the horizontal dimension while reading and describes the amount of text one takes in as a unit. We measure the mean perceptual span in a reading sequence as a cognitive effort feature. Since regression fixations may occur, a reading sequence can have several left to right subsequences. ber of fixations in the left to right reading subsequence and i =1, ... , n 1.

The reading/skimming distinction made by Buscher et al. (2008b) is similar to our definition of mean perceptual span, although we classify reading sequences in a different way. 3.2.6. Reading speed
Reading speed is the ratio of the amount of text processed (the reading length ) to the processing time. Reading speed is a function of the duration of the individual fixations in the reading sequence, the spacing of the fixations (perceptual span), and the regressions in the reading sequence. 3.3. Reading sequence level analysis of the information acquisition process
In this paper, we represent the user X  X  experience of information acquisition due to reading during the search as a contig-uous collection of reading sequences. Using the operationalization described above, cognitive effort measures were calcu-lated for each reading sequence.

A reading sequence that consists of many fixations might have particular significance for analysis because of the extended needed to acquire word meaning and meaning in context. At the same time, multiple fixations on a line of text result in tak-ing in not only the meaning of the words but also the concepts that are referenced using the words. Recall also that it is com-mon for some fixations in an extended reading sequence to be retrograde. Such fixations are associated with conceptually difficult passages, resolution of references, and domain expertise.

In the analysis, general statistics on all reading sequences are examined. We then focus on a subset of longer reading sequences. It seems plausible these longer reading sequences may be more indicative of domain knowledge effects because of the extended attention to that text by the user. A reading sequence that consists of many fixations might mark points where the participant was more likely to be using concepts during information acquisition and one can hypothesize greater concept person may more likely have the experience of acquiring information because of the attention allocated to acquiring that text.
For practical reasons, we used four or more fixations as a threshold to select the reading sequence subset because any eye lated scanning fixation. This four fixation threshold is arbitrary, however, and it could have been set higher. We found that the distribution of reading sequences by length followed a power law, and significantly fewer sequences would be available for analysis if the number were set much higher. Future work will look at differences in the cognitive effort measurements as a function of reading sequence length to see if knowledge effects are present. 3.4. Modeling domain knowledge using eye movement behaviors
We want to make models of domain knowledge from the eye movement behavior data in order to explore for behavioral features and interactions between features that can contribute to eventual development of effective prediction models that an observation of the participant X  X  domain knowledge. A supervised learning approach is employed and the models were learned from the cognitive effort vectors for each reading sequence labeled with the PDK measurement (Section 3.1.1 ) for the participant.

We constructed two exploratory models: a simple linear model and a model using the random forests ensemble tech-nique. In both cases, we explore to see if the models can indicate the knowledge level of a given participant using the fol-lowing procedure. First, just the reading sequences are selected, ignoring the isolated fixations, for each task session by participant. These task session reading sequences are then used as input to the model to calculate a predicted domain knowl-edge value for that participant. This procedure is carried out for each of the four tasks. Then the mean of the four domain knowledge values for each participant is calculated. This mean value is then compared to the participant X  X  MeSH domain knowledge (PDK) to see if they are correlated.

Our goal is to do exploratory modeling to validate the model approaches and isolate significant behavior features, rather than make predictions. The evaluation procedure, in particular, is not appropriate for testing a true predictive model. We used all of the cognitive effort data to construct the models, however the knowledge levels are learned without consideration of the user or the task. Since these both varied, the comparison of the knowledge level calculated by the models given the reading sequences for a single participant task session (and then averaged over the four task sessions completed by the par-ticipant) with the PDK calculated independently from the MeSH concepts is a valid way to understand the relative classifi-cation efficacy of the models. 3.4.1. Linear model construction
For each of the long reading sequences, a vector of the cognitive effort measures was constructed. Each vector was labeled with the PDK value. A Gaussian family linear model was then constructed using this bag of labeled cognitive effort vectors. 3.4.2. Random forests
Random forests (RF) provide a more sophisticated modeling approach to our problem. RF is an ensemble machine learning technique that learns both the model structure and the parameters from the data, rather than proposing a specific model of the variablesforfitting,asinthelinearregressionapproach( Breiman,2001 ).RFmodelsareresistanttooverfittingandprovideper-
Model performance for RF is measured by the out of bag (OOB) error. OOB error is very close to the cross validation error because each tree in a random forest is constructed by random resampling of the data and also the variables, selecting the most discriminative feature at each node. At each step roughly 37% of the data is held out to test the tree ( Breiman et al., 2003 ) in the process of finding the best variable to split on from the random subset of the variables selected for consider-ation. The rest of the data is used to calculate the OOB error. 3.4.3. Suitability to user-centered interaction models
Random forests have become an important modeling technique for situations where there are fewer observations than predictors. In the present work, there are more observations than features. The attractive aspects of RF for our work are rooted in the complexities of human interactions with information during search. There are inherent limitations in handling mation goal, and the information seeking strategy employed for the current search stage. Purely local techniques, such as linear regression and similar models, may be particularly ill-suited to models of cognitively-driven information seeking.
Random forests is an appropriate exploratory modeling approach given our lack of understanding of the causal mecha-nism by which knowledge is used during reading. RFs do not require pre-selection of features and they have good predictive performance even if many features used are irrelevant to the classification. This is well-suited to our user-centered repre-sentation of the information acquisition process, which is both a model of information search and a cognitive modeling ence of outliers because of the random sampling of features and data. Our exploratory modeling of cognitive effort effects during search cannot easily dismiss outliers because we cannot know if they may be significant observations of cognitive processing. They may be exceptions due to instrumentation or cognitive glitches during the experiment that are not indic-ative of the influence of knowledge on the reading process.
 Information search in task sessions involves non-linear and conditionalized relationships ( Wildemuth, 2004; Qiu, 1993; complex and evolving structure of feature importance may be a basic characteristic of high-fidelity task session models. Decision tree ensemble methods are attractive because they exploit subspace partitioning that reflect interaction effects.
Individual trees in the forest can capture conditional structure expressed in the data because each tree classifies in a sub-space and will correspond to a distinct feature set that may be correlated with the conditional structure of the object of the model ( Bengio, Delalleau, &amp; Simard, 2010 ). 3
Random forests have other attractive features for modeling cognitive environments. They are insensitive to monotone transformations of subsets of features, again because of the random forests exploitation of random subspaces. In our case, the cognitive effort features, while measuring different cognitive constructs, may well have correlations between them be-cause they all depend on fixation location and duration. For example, perceptual span is an average of saccade distances in the reading sequence and can be expected to be correlated with the ratio of reading length to reading sequence total dura-tion. Such feature subcollections may covary in the same direction but have differences in covariance that depends on the conditionalized situation for the information acquisition process. This may be a general problem for model production and analysis in cognitive approaches to learning human information interactions.

Finally, random forests modeling can handle mixtures of continuous and categorical features. This is well-suited to com-bining multiple behavior observation sources of search interaction. In this work we use only continuous cognitive effort measures, but are extending it to incorporate more traditional behavioral features, including categorical measures such as whether a page has been revisited or was used to click though to another document.

From a number of perspectives, RF approaches are well-suited to model cognitive mechanisms that are unknown and, for now, unobservable. They are a good match for the general problem of modeling human search information interaction from a user-centered perspective.

Random forests is an appropriate exploratory modeling approach for domain knowledge given our lack of understanding of the causal mechanism by which knowledge manifests itself in information acquisition through the reading process. We used the RandomForest library in the statistical computing environment, R, which implements Breiman (2001) . 3.5. Analysis strategy
In this paper we build exploratory models of the participant X  X  self-rated domain knowledge using the cognitive effort measurements derived from reading eye movement patterns. Fig. 3 shows the flow of the logic for the analysis using the random forests model. The same logic is used for the linear regression model. Briefly, we create reading sequences from eye movement logs using the reading model and then calculate a vector of cognitive effort measures for each reading se-quence. Each reading sequence is labeled with the MeSH self-rated domain knowledge value for the participant in the task then applied to the data for individual participants to see if it predicts the participant X  X  level of domain knowledge. 4. Results 4.1. Eye movement behaviors and domain knowledge
When all reading sequences are considered, the distribution of each of the cognitive effort measures was not normal, therefore non-parametric methods were used to analyze the data. Correlations were found between participant domain knowledge and three of the cognitive effort measures: Perceptual span (Kruskal X  X allis v
LADE (Kruskal X  X allis v 2 (36) = 5570.10, p &lt; .001), and reading speed (Kruskal X  X allis v
Long reading sequences might better reflect concept use by participants during information acquisition because of the is more engaged with the content and concepts of the text. It is therefore more likely knowledge effects may be detected in the cognitive effort measurements for those reading sequences. For practical reasons, we used four or more fixations as a threshold to select these reading sequences which comprised 7.5% (19477/258586) of the total collection of reading se-quences. The mean number of regressions in this subset was reasonably close to a normal distribution but was not correlated significantly with domain knowledge.

The other cognitive effort measures for long reading sequences were correlated with domain knowledge. Perceptual span was normally distributed and correlated (ANOVA F (1,19199) = 29.14, p &lt; .001), as was reading speed (ANOVA F (1,150) = 5.23, p = .024). Median LADE was not normally distributed but was still correlated with domain knowledge (Krus-kal X  X allis v 2 (36) = 4724.89, p &lt; .001). 4.2. Linear model results 4.2.1. Linear model construction
Using all of the long reading sequences, a linear model was constructed using all of the reading sequence cognitive effort vectors. The contribution and significance of each of the cognitive effort features is shown in Table 1 .
To see if this simple model could indicate the knowledge level of a given participant, we selected just the reading se-quences, ignoring the isolated fixations, for each task session by participant. These reading sequences were used as the mod-el input to calculate a domain knowledge value for that participant. This procedure was carried out for each of the four tasks.
The mean of the four domain knowledge values was calculated for each participant and compared with the self-rated MeSH domain knowledge (PDK). The knowledge levels calculated by the model were correlated with the PDK MeSH values (ANOVA
F (1,36) = 4.78, p = 0.035). The standard deviation of the mean domain knowledge value produced by the model was an order of magnitude lower as compared to the standard deviation of the PDK value (0.011 vs. 0.132).

To examine the model performance, we grouped the participants by the mean domain knowledge value produced by the model using the hierarchical cluster technique described in Section 3.1.1 . Procedure-and-calculation. These groupings were compared to the knowledge levels identified in the MeSH-term rating groups ( Table 2 ). The linear model gave reasonable discrimination between the high and low domain knowledge groups. After removing non-native English speakers ( n = 14), the model results were better for the high knowledge group, but deteriorated somewhat for the low knowledge group ( Table 3 ). 4.3. Random forests modeling results
Like the linear model, the RF model was trained on all of the reading sequences and then used to calculate a domain knowledge value for each participant using just the data from the four task sessions carried out by the participant.
The relative significance of each of the features in the RF model is shown in Table 4 . The relative importance of each cog-of information gain measure. The number of regressions offer relatively little gain compared to some of the other cognitive effort measures.

We test the RF model in the same way as for the linear model. A domain knowledge value was calculated using the model for each participant task session. Then the mean of these domain knowledge values for each participant X  X  four task sessions was calculated. Fig. 4 shows the high correlation between the participant X  X  MeSH domain knowledge (PDK) and the RF knowledge calculation (ANOVA F (1,36) = 3913.3, p &lt; .001). The calculated domain knowledge values were clustered in the same way the MeSH domain knowledge representation was clustered and the domain knowledge groups (high, interme-diate, low) can be compared ( Table 5 ). The classification accuracy is excellent and is perfect when only native English speakers are included ( Table 6 ). 4.4. Model differences by level of domain knowledge in the random forests model. Fig. 5 shows the relative importance of cognitive effort features in random forests models, mea-sured by the % increase in mean square error, fitted to the three domain knowledge groups. One can see that the number of fixations and regressions in a reading sequence contribute relatively less to the fitted models as compared to mean percep-tual span, reading speed and length, total lexical fixation duration, and LADE measures (maxDur, medianDur) on the consti-tutive fixations. The pattern of relative feature importance does not vary much over the fitted models.

However, some interesting differences emerge when the feature importance for the RF model on native English speakers is plotted ( Fig. 6 ). For several features a clearer distinction by domain knowledge emerges. One interesting difference with the feature importance for all participants is for the regression features (nRegress and 4plusRegress), where the features are seen to make a bigger contribution to the model discrimination for high knowledge participants. 5. Discussion
It is intuitively plausible that user characteristics that influence the process of information search should be reflected in both high level behaviors, such as document dwell time, document use, and query formulation patterns, and in low level behaviors associated with the information acquisition process such as eye movement patterns. These user properties may be constraints or key parameters in the process of formulating and carrying out a strategy and tactics to acquire the information needed to complete the task.

The low level eye movement behaviors we studied show correlations between user domain knowledge and measure-ments of eye movement patterns that reflect cognitive effort in the reading process. Reading speed, the fixation duration in excess of that minimally needed to acquire word meaning (LADE), and the spacing of fixations (perceptual span) were all significantly correlated with the user X  X  genomics domain knowledge.

These results are consistent with the claim that the cognitive effort measures can represent the user X  X  semantic experi-ence during search which provide a basis for decision-making and other actions as exemplified by higher-order behaviors.
The correlations with user-assessed domain knowledge and the success of the preliminary domain knowledge models sup-ports this claim because we expect the user X  X  knowledge to manifest itself in the process of both selecting text to read and in the acquisition of word meaning and concepts from the text. To be sure, the relationship between knowledge and this inter-action process is complex. It is to be expected that experts will select text differently than non-experts in accordance with their understanding of the task goal. We believe a strength of grounding our approach in the measurement of objective cog-ticular model of the unobservable cognitive process that results in the observable actions. Apart from the challenge of formulating such models in the absence of a general model of human cognition, any such model is likely not testable in com-plex interactions characteristic of real world search. Instead, we have chosen to focus on modeling the process of information acquisition because it is observable and because it has a one-to-one relationship with an aspect of the user experience of search interaction. The causal linkage between the user X  X  knowledge, cognitive abilities, and their interaction with text in task difficulty and now domain knowledge.

The exploratory modeling was carried out with a desire to validate the model approaches and isolate significant behavior features, rather than make predictions. All of the data was used to make the models, although we learned the knowledge level without consideration of the user or the task.

The linear model did a reasonable job of classifying users against the MeSH term knowledge representation. Model pre-diction was improved when we took account of the native language of the participant. Such an improvement is not surpris-ing since reading in a second language might be expected to affect the user X  X  cognitive effort in reading processes somewhat independently of their level of domain knowledge. The improvement in the model classification performance when this source of noise in the relationship between level of domain knowledge and reading effort is eliminated is further evidence of the validity of the cognitive effort modeling approach.

Performance was much better when we used random forests, a more sophisticated modeling technique. Again, the level of domain knowledge was learned using each reading sequence as an observation of domain knowledge. We stress that the purpose of our work is exploratory in nature and the goal is not to generate a proper prediction model. Although we used all of the labeled data in learning the models, we did so without regard to participant or the task session. Individuals differ in many different ways and two people with similar levels of domain knowledge would not necessarily have (nearly) the same reading eye movement cognitive effort measurements. The fact that regression models learned on the entire pool of the cog-nitive effort data were successful in predicting the individual participant X  X  knowledge levels provides evidence that the eye movements in reading sequences do have some smoothly varying relationship to the level of domain knowledge. The re-search literature suggests a plausible explanation: eye movements in reading and information search involve interaction with concepts that are constitutive of a person X  X  knowledge, at least in part. However, the domain knowledge level was a unique characteristic of the user because no two users had the same domain knowledge value, and the performance of the random forests model may therefore be somewhat misleading as a predictive model. Future work will explore perfor-mance of the model in the prediction task.

Random forests models were constructed using cognitive effort observations from the three domain knowledge groups identified by hierarchical clustering. The results show little difference in the structure of the models by domain knowledge.
There were fewer high domain knowledge ( n = 6) and low domain knowledge ( n = 8) participants compared to the interme-diate domain knowledge ( n = 24) participants, and so the uncertainty around the feature importance measures is greater for those models. Still, the overall agreement of the relative feature importance is quite good. The stability of the model struc-ture when fitted to different knowledge groups helps to explain the observed success of the random forests model in dis-criminating between the domain knowledge groups when the model is learned from all participants.
 This suggests good predictive models are likely to have significant complexity.

The reading model analysis technique requires only input of recent eye fixations, specifically the location and duration of the fixation, and simple processing. These measures of the user X  X  current processing of text meaning could be generated in near real-time and can be available for every interaction segment in the task session. Personalization of search interaction would benefit most from early prediction of the user X  X  domain knowledge, so one direction for further analysis is to identify when a domain knowledge prediction can be made with reasonable confidence in a task session.
 Our examination of the eye tracking logs shows that reading in the search sessions was unlike extended reading of a text.
It was characterized by reading short snippets in one section, e.g. in search results, followed by very short reading sequences that might be characterized as scanning and isolated fixations of sufficient duration to acquire word meaning. Our method-ology has some shortcomings in this regard. We do not, for example, model extended reading sequences of multiple lines of rithms can be improved in this regard, but differences in font sizes and layouts on different content pages introduce com-plexities that need to be accommodated. Similar challenges exist in calculating how much text has been read, and so on.
It is important to note that application of the deep body of work on eye movements and reading to problems in dynamic information search environments must proceed cautiously because of the differences in the experiment environments and the main problems researchers seek to address. Our approach has been to concentrate on work related to processing at the sentence, phrase, and word level. We have been especially cautious in applying reading research work directed at more abstract levels, such as text comprehension, and work at structural levels of texts and presentation, such as how people interact in different page layouts precisely because translation to search environments is unlike reading a page in a book.
How to apply existing research into reading in information search task sessions is an important problem and must be ad-dressed experimentally. 5.1. Limitations
A significant limitation is that this work has been carried out in one experiment and domain. This work has been carried out in one experiment and domain. In future work we will apply the same techniques to an independent user study, where participants carried out journalism tasks.

Domain knowledge representation is difficult to achieve and there are a number of shortcomings in the MeSH-based rep-resentation used in this study. For example, the coverage of rated MeSH terms ( n = 409) in the entire MeSH space ( n = 25,186) is an important limitation. This reflects a general problem for knowledge representation. It is exceedingly hard to say how much coverage in a concept space is needed for a useful representation. An attraction of the MeSH system is the detailed and comprehensive coverage in the domain. Unfortunately, such resources are not available for other domains. We believe one strength in our study design is that participants made a series of independent judgments about their knowledge of specific concepts rather than an overall judgment about their knowledge of the general area (say genomics) or the task itself. In other work we compared the collection of specific concept judgments with the general assessment ( Cole et al., 2010 ) and found correlations, but also significant variances.

For the eye movement pattern cognitive effort model, the analysis in this paper concerns a sequence of reading eye fix-ations. We assume that all of the reading fixations represent engaged reading and are not a  X  X indless X  passing of the eyes over the words. Eye movement behaviors are likely to be naturally aligned with a user X  X  experience of search as a sequence of page interactions. It is plausible domain knowledge effects on search results pages may be different than on the link (con-tent) pages. Such page level analysis is an obvious next step since it correlates with the high level page-oriented observa-tional units, such as document use and dwell time.

Our ultimate goal is to be able to build systems that can automatically personalize search interactions. To address the problem of general domain and user application of such a system we have focused on learning user and other models from observed behaviors of interaction with information during search. One thread in this paper is the suggestion that analyzing eye movement patterns to make moment to moment cognitive effort measurements can provide a direct and robust means to observe lowlevel behaviors that connectdirectly with user cognitive states. Animportant questionthen is the general appli-cability of eye movement patterns analysis. Dyslexia has significant prevalence ( 5%) in the population and may have a deep association with disruptions in eye movement patterns, perhaps in difficulties in phonological processing of seen text or in an explicitly screen for these disorders and it is possible our data set included individuals with these conditions. In the larger project of making personalized systems it is clear significant attention will need to be given to accommodation of individuals is a clear limitation in our study, it could be a significant attraction for further development of cognitive-effort eye move-ment-based personalization because detection of such users may be more difficult with less direct behavior observations. 6. Conclusions
The main contribution of this paper has been to demonstrate the plausibility of building models to infer a user X  X  level of domain knowledge using certain information behaviors that require no need to process the content of queries or documents.
Such models could potentially be domain-independent. Another contribution of this paper is the presentation of a technique based on analysis of eye movement patterns to represent the user X  X  textual information acquisition process. From this one can model an important aspect of the user X  X  experience of interactive information retrieval. We presented two exploratory regression models to infer user domain knowledge from eye tracking logs. Implicit detection of the user X  X  domain knowledge or knowledge of their current task would be useful not only for search systems but also across a wide variety of information systems, for example intelligent tutoring systems.

Eye movement patterns are especially powerful for development of user-centered information systems because they have a direct relationship with the cognitive processing that connects document content with the user X  X  knowledge of the meaning of the text. Patterns of spatial X  X emporal processing of regions of pages, or transitions from processing information objects to system interactions offer promising features for modeling the user X  X  cognitive engagement in the search process.
There is a wealth of research in cognitive psychology and related fields that provide a solid empirical foundation for analysis of eye movement patterns in information search interactions.

The technique we have developed is not necessarily restricted to research laboratory settings. The eye movement pattern methodology has very low computational demands. It involves trivial calculations using the position and duration of fixa-tions over a few seconds. Calculations of cognitive effort due to reading can be made easily while the person is engaged in their task, enabling real-time detection of the user X  X  level of domain knowledge.

While the results are from a single study and knowledge domain, it is plausible that these low-level information behav-iors reflect cognitive effort and search strategies that depend on a user X  X  knowledge of their task domain. Future work will make prediction models based on cognitive effort data from this user study and perform a similar analysis on results from an independent user study in the journalism task domain.

A person X  X  use of knowledge during search drives the interaction process. These results provide evidence that the level of a user X  X  domain task knowledge can be inferred from eye movement observations available during their search process. This could allow for dynamic personalization of an information system to improve its effectiveness.
