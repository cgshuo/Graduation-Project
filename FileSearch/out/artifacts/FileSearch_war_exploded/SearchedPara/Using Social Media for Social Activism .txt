 This paper uses qualitative res earch methods to analyze how members of the Seattle chapter of a social activist group, Asha for Education, use social media, such as Yahoo! Groups, Microsoft distribution lists, and Facebook to coordinate their organizational activities, fundraise, and build and strengthen community. K.4.3 Organizational Impacts Human Factors The internet has enabled social activist groups to easily reach out to the global population through em ail, instant messaging, chat groups, blogs, and a wide range of social media. Our study aims to understand how the members of the Seattle Chapter of Asha for Education, a non-profit organization, use social media to coordinate activities related to the organization, fundraise, and build community. The mission of Asha for Education is to catalyze socio-economic change in India through education of underprivileged children. This re quires active coordination with Asha volunteers in India, who are instrumental in executing different projects. Their website st ates that the organization runs on  X  X ero administrative costs X ; project management, project coordination, fundraising, and event organization are conducted by volunteers using social media. The choice of media like Yahoo! Groups, Microsoft distribu tion lists (DLs), and Facebook depends on the activities that need to be done, the affordability of the technology for supporting specific functions, and their success rate for accomplishing specific goals. An examination of the literature reveals that scholars focus on analyzing the effects of the use of social media on social activism. They study how social media help create solidarity and mutual identification, and increase the effectiveness of social organizations [1]. They examine how the internet encourages people to participate in social causes [2]. Some explore how offline social movements build and reinforce collective identity through the use of online tools [3]. Conversely, others believe that the internet helps to motivate only people who are already interested in and involved with a particular cause [4] and so does not greatly affect civic enga gement. Our study focuses on understanding ways in which a social activist group uses social media for its day-to-day operations. This study was conducted using qualitative research methods, primarily semi-structured interv iews to answer the research question  X  X ow do members of the Seattle Chapter of Asha for Education use social media to coordinate their activities? X  Five men and three women, aged 26 to 43 years, participated in the study. Six out of eight participan ts are employees at Microsoft Corporation, a company in the software and technology sector. The interview protocol consiste d of 10 open-ended questions. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed to identify common themes. The interviews ranged from 30 to 45 minutes in length. Pseudonyms are used for quoting participants. The success of Asha for Education projects depends in large part on generating funds. This entails building awareness about the mission of the organization and about the fund raising events it sponsors. Building awareness means both creating internal awareness, such as broadcasting a message to existing Asha members, or external awareness, such as targeting non-members primarily for fundraising purposes. While Yahoo! Groups is an effective tool for promoting internal awareness, its utility for creating external awareness is limited. For example, the requirement of membership status, or at least a valid email address, may di scourage potential members or contributors. In contrast, soci al media such as Facebook do not require membership or provision of personal information in order for users to be invited to or notified of group events. It was during the recession of 2009 that Asha created a group Facebook page in order to expand awareness and f und-raising opportunities, despite some members X  reluctance to join the social media website. Asha Seattle did not meet its goal for fund-raising through Facebook last year, but interview ees report an optimistic outlook. On the other hand, Facebook X  X  lack of success has been compensated for by Microsoft DLs. As participants pointed out, the main advantage that Microsoft DLs have over Facebook for fundraising and recruiting volunteers is the built-in trustworthiness of information received through Microsoft DLs. Sachin says:  X  X t is so much mo re trustworthy when it is in a DL...you know the DLs are set up by Microsoft employees. The Facebook page can be set up by anybody and it can be a scam or something to get money and stuff. Anybody can open an account on Facebook and tell anything. The DLs...that is like the internal thing, so it X  X  more believable. X  Th e fact that the DLs were set up by Microsoft employees was re ported as one of the primary reasons for trusting the inform ation and the announcements by potential members. Facebook page, the Junior Asha page has been quite successful in its fundraising endeavors. Junior Asha is an Asha Facebook page set up by teenagers, who are mostly children of Asha members. The Junior Asha group has also created a band that performs at fundraising events and as reported by our participants have been quite successful in promoting its events through Facebook. The ambivalence of Asha members to Facebook is borne out by our data. Asha members state that the only way to encourage their children X  X  X  involvement in Asha is through Facebook; other forms of social media do not appeal to the younger generation. This led Deepika, one of our participan ts, to start the Junior Asha Facebook page with her two teenage children. She says her daughter:  X ...finds out about all those events through Facebook, not through the newspaper, the television, or even personal emails. She doesn X  X  even open her MSN account. And so I knew that we would be losing a lot of kids if we just relied on Yahoo! Groups. These kids...they see that as clutter. And the way to get them is through Facebook. X  In contrast, senior members of Asha are reluctant to use Facebook becau se they are not avid Facebook users and are not as familiar with its functionalities as the younger generation. They prefer the trustworthiness of Microsoft DLs and feel that using Microsoft DLs are the most effective ways to reach out to current and potential volunteers and donors. Despite this ambivalence about Facebook on the part of senior Asha members, some Asha Seattle members do use Facebook in interesting ways. They use their personal Facebook pages more than the official group page to promote or publicize an event or comment on and link to posts on As ha related events on others X  walls. Arjun explains how with one status update from his personal page, he can create publicity and awareness of Asha causes:  X  X acebook is a good place to announce events and stuff like that. People get to know. That helps. So...since there are not many fans in the Asha Seattle Facebook account [page], what I do is that to make the other friends know what's going on, I make the announcements in my page. X  This kind of indirect publicity on Facebook often helps Asha in raising funds rather than direct attempts. As for outright fundraisi ng, Rani talks about using the  X  X ause feature X  of Facebook, aski ng her friends to donate to Asha instead of sending gifts on her birthday. Out of all the social media that Asha volunteers use, the interview data reveal that Facebook is the preferred tool for engaging in more informal social communications and for building community morale. Actively engaged Asha volunt eers spend time communicating with one another to accomplish the day-to-day work of their projects: reminding other volunt eers about upcoming meetings, sending out minutes from past meetings, reminding each other of task assignments, and coordi nating their overall volunteer activities. Asha Seattle members prefer to communicate selectively with people to whom the topic is relevant. While on some occasions they wish to reach out to the entire organization and share their achievements for a project, for most cases they target the message to a small gr oup or even a single person. Being able to target a small group is essential for two reasons. First, confidentiality of various monetary transactions cannot be openly publicized. Second, Asha members talk about the time and energy required for someone to read an email as a type of currency not to be wasted. The majority of these task-rela ted communications occurs through Yahoo! Groups. Participation in Asha Seattle Yahoo! Groups is mandatory for all members. The reason that Yahoo! Groups is preferred by Seattle Asha members over other social media like Facebook is because they feel it is more reliable and there is socially expected response tim e inherent in email. One participant, Arjun, points out this aspect when he says:  X  X mail is much easier and well defined. [With] email, still you can say that people are committed to answering you within a given timeframe, usually within a couple of days . But with Facebook, we are still not at a point where...people are responding within a good amount of time. X  Storing and sharing important financial records or documents related to individual pr ojects is another major concern for Asha members. With Asha chapters located across the United States and non-profit partners across the world, the ability to function without co-location is integral to its ability to function at all. By providing unlimited storage facility, Yahoo! Groups facilitates the core work of the organization and removes many of the barriers faced by groups that rely solely on co-location. The ability to support a large number of collaborators over large distances is one of the hallmarks of social media. Asha has found that different social media s upport different tasks better than others. While some Asha members are reluctant to move to new social media and see limitations with only one social medium, most have successfully combined Yahoo Groups!, Microsoft DLs, and Facebook to meet Asha X  X  goa ls. By reducing participation costs, promoting collective identity, and fostering the feeling of community, social media help As ha members coordinate their organizational activities, fundraise, and build community and morale, supporting a transnational organization like Asha.
