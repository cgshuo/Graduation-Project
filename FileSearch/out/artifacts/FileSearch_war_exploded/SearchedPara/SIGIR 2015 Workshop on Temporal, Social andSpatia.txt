 Spatial and temporal context are tightly coupled. For ex-ample, users may visit a place during specific times of the day or on certain days of the week. Some places have special relevance during a specific time of the year, or only exist for a limited window of time. Understanding the spatial and temporal context of a user is often necessary to understand their information need. Understanding the user X  X  spatial and temporal context is especially important on a mobile device where the space is limited, and the user expectation far exceeds the ability of the technology to satisfy him.
Users provide an unprecedented volume of detailed and continuously updated information about where they are, what they are doing, who they are with, and what they are thinking and feeling about their current activities. The pro-vision of this stream creates an informal contract between the user and the information access application that is ex-pected to provide results that are contextually relevant.
In this workshop, we build on the previous three suc-cessful editions [1, 2, 3], and explore spatial and temporal context in dynamic geotagged collections such as Wikipedia, traditional news sources, as well as social media sites such as Twitter, Foursquare, Facebook and Flickr. We also inves-tigate the geo-temporal dynamics of user engagements with apps and search engines on mobile devices and cross-device. c  X  We aim to bring together practitioners and researchers to discuss their recent breakthroughs and the challenges with addressing spatial and temporal information access, both from the algorithmic and the architectural perspectives.

The workshop relates to all aspects of geographical and time-sensitive information access. TAIA2015 has a special focus on events, to include event detection, recommendation, and characterization. Research questions include:
In addition, TAIA2015 welcomes contributions on the fol-lowing issues that complement current technologies in spa-tial and temporal information: The workshop will include two keynotes, a series of talks (20-30 minutes each) from accepted papers as well as a breakout session and discussions to identify research challenges and to foster understanding between the different communities. The two keynotes, given by Barbara Poblete (University of Chile) and Omar Alonso (Microsoft) provide a mix of aca-demic and industrial perspectives on the workshop theme. [1] F. Diaz, S. Dumais, M.
