 In an interactive information-seek ing environment, it is important to consider more user-centric no tion of relevance, which includes motivational and affective relevance. In this poster we introduce the notion of group X  X  affective relevance for collaborative information seeking. We propos e a new model for implementing and studying group X  X  affective rele vance in information systems that provide support for collabora tive information seeking. In addition, we present preliminary results from a laboratory experiment for studying how aff ective information judgments are related to the performance of a group.

Group X  X  affective relevance, Colla borative information seeking. It is generally accepted that relevance means pertinence, indicating usefulness of the object in question in a particular context. On the other hand, for several years the field of information science has debated a bout the concept of relevance; to this end, different authors ha ve done extensive reviews of the concept showing its complexity [1]. Indeed, as described by both Saracevic [6] and Mizarro [5], today we do not talk about  X  X elevance X ; instead we refer to it as  X  X elevances X , reflecting the multidimensionality of the concept. In this manner, information scien tists today are able to talk from algorithmic relevance, which is linked to information retrieval systems, to more human versions of the concept, such as motivational and affective relevan ce. Beyond the various kinds of relevance, none of them consider the dynamic evaluation of information in group contexts, wh ich is the case of collaborative information seeking (CIS) and where the notion of relevance adopts a social dimension. Our inte rest in this poster is to propose and measure a new kind of releva nce, namely group X  X  affective relevance (GAR), and also a model for supporting it in CIS environments. Among the variety of problems and s ituations studied in the field of information science, relevan ce is central and probably one of the most important elements. As pointed out above, relevance has been described as a multidimensional concept that must be studied carefully based on application domain, goals of an information-seeking situation, and related contextual information. As described by several authors, relevance can be algorithmic, topical, cognitive, situational, or affective (e.g., [6]). Particularly the latter is considered by differe nt authors as transversal to the other subjective kinds of relevance [1,2]. It has been assumed in some way that these relevances originally defined for individual informati on seeking are also applied to more social scenarios, like CIS; nevertheless, fe w studies have been done for evaluating relevance in this kind of contexts. Zhang for example, proposed the id ea of collaborative relevance judgment as a measure of user X  X  search performance [8]. The general idea behind this approach is that certain information is considered more relevant as more users collect it. Human beings are able to feel, e xpress, and recognize emotions in their daily lives; particularly when people work together, they share thoughts and opinions in a rational way, but also they are accompanied by emotions. As reported in [3], affects may impact either positively or negatively the performance of teams. If these people or groups are working in an information seeking situation, affective dimension may be critical to their collaborative task. Given this, our goal is to understand and evaluate affective relevance for a group in a CIS environment. Taking the idea of affective relevance [6] to CIS, we could evaluate the performance of teams in terms of the emotional experiences of their members; but also we could explore how feelings expressed through info rmation judgments impact the quality and relevance of the information that users gather during the information seeking process. In addition we could study how users are affected by the judgments of their peers regarding the information they share and how this finally affect to the team as a social system. It is in this se nse that we propose the notion of Group X  X  Affective Relevance (GAR), which we define as the overall emotional experience of each group member with regard to specific information object that he/she shares with the group. Our goal by introducing GAR in CIS is to provide better ways of emotional awareness [4]. To facilita te this, it is necessary that CIS systems allow group members to e xpress and represent what they feel and think about the information they collect and share. Such reactions or impressions could be measured in different ways; some examples are facial e xpression recognition, linguistic analyses, voice intonation, and ga lvanic response of the skin. Irrespective of the technical resources that we could use to measure effectively users X  fee lings, we propose a general model for implementing GAR as part of the communication channels that individuals use when they seek information collaboratively. Figure 1 presents an activity diag ram from one user X  X  perspective in his/her interaction with the system and his/her collaborators, either synchronously or asynchronously. The hearts in some activities represent the presence, codification, and communication of emotions. To commence our investigation on GAR for CIS, we ran a preliminary study using data previously collected in an experiment of CIS [7]. Since th e experiment was not designed to explore GAR, we were limited in terms of the data we had to evaluate this idea. As a summary, we had access to chat logs and the performance measure for each group. We used the chat logs as our primary source to identify aff ective judgments of information objects. For this, we coded more than 6000 messages, using two different systems of codes: va lence of the messages (positive, negative, and neutral) and per ceived relevance (whether the message involves information j udgments or not). The coding process was done by two independe nt coders with high level of inter-coder reliability (Cohen X  X  kappa = 0.773). With this data we generated clusters using K-Means over the number of positive, negative, and neutral informati on judgments as well as precision as measure of performance. As a result we found three main clusters -low, medium, and high performance teams -as shown in Table 1. We found that the closer the distance between the number of positive, negative, and neutral information judgments, the higher the performance of teams as measured by precision. This indicates an interesting correla tion between expressed emotions and performance of a group. Through this poster we proposed a notion of group X  X  affective relevance (GAR) and a model for implementing and studying it in collaborative information seek ing (CIS) systems. In our preliminary study we found three ma in clusters that characterize teams in terms of informa tion judgments and performance expressed as precision. Due to the limitation of the linguistic approach in the present study, in our next study we will examine the same problem under a multimodal approach, which will include the study of emotions using multiple instruments.
