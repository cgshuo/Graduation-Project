 The problem of determining and inferring the sense of a word on the basis of its context has been the subject of quite a bit of research. Earlier investiga-tions have mainly focused on the disambiguation of word senses from information contained in the con-text, e.g. Sch  X  utze (1998) or on the induction of word senses (Yarowsky, 1995). Only recently, the field has added a diachronic dimension to its investiga-tions and has moved towards the computational de-tection of sense development over time (Sagi et al., 2009; Cook and Stevenson, 2010), thereby comple-menting theoretical investigations in historical lin-guistics with information gained from large corpora. These approaches have concentrated on measuring general changes in the meaning of a word (e.g., nar-rowing or pejoration), whereas in this paper we deal with cases where words acquire a new sense by ex-tending their contexts to other domains.

For the scope of this investigation we restrict our-selves to cases of semantic change in English even though the methodology is generally language in-dependent. Our choice is on the one hand moti-vated by the extensive knowledge available on se-mantic change in English. On the other hand, our choice was driven by the availability of large cor-pora for English. In particular, we used the New York Times Annotated Corpus. 1 Given the variety and the amount of text available, we are able to track changes from 1987 until 2007 in 1.8 million news-paper articles.

In order to be able to explore our approach in a fruitful manner, we decided to concentrate on words which have acquired a new dimension of use due to the introduction of computing and the internet, e.g., to browse, to surf, bookmark . In particular, the Netscape Navigator was introduced in 1994 and our data show that this does indeed correlate with a change in use of these words.

Our approach combines methods from the fields of Information Visualization and Visual Analyt-ics (Thomas and Cook, 2005; Keim et al., 2010) with unsupervised techniques from Natural Lan-guage Processing ( NLP ). This combination provides a novel instrument which allows for tracking the di-achronic development of word meaning by visual-izing the contexts in which the words occur. Our overall aim is not to replace linguistic analysis in this field with an automatic method, but to guide re-search by generating new hypotheses about the de-velopment of semantic change. The computational modeling of word senses is based on the assumption that the meaning of a word can be inferred from the words in its immediate con-text ( X  X ontext words X ). Research in this area mainly focuses on two related tasks: Word Sense Disam-biguation ( WSD ) and Word Sense Induction ( WSI ). The goal of WSD is to classify occurrences of pol-ysemous words according to manually predefined senses. One popular method for performing such a classification is Latent Semantic Analysis ( LSA ) (Deerwester et al., 1990), with other methods also suitable for the task (see Navigli (2009) for an ex-tensive survey).

The aim of WSI is to learn word senses from text corpora without having a predefined number of senses. This goal is more difficult to achieve, as it is not clear beforehand how many senses should be extracted and how a sense could be described in an abstract way. Recently, however, Brody and Lapata (2009) have shown that Latent Dirichlet Allocation (
LDA ) (Blei et al., 2003) can be successfully applied to perform word sense induction from small word contexts.

The original idea of LSA and LDA is to learn  X  X op-ics X  from documents, whereas in our scenario word contexts rather than documents are used, i.e., a small number of words before and after the word under investigation (bag of words). Sagi et al. (2009) have demonstrated that broadening and narrowing of word senses can be tracked over time by applying LSA to small word contexts in diachronic corpora. In addition, we will use LDA , which has proven even more reliable in the course of our investigations.
In general, the aim of our paper is to go beyond the approach of Sagi et al. (2009) and analyze se-mantic change in more detail. Ideally, a starting point of change is found and the development over time can be tracked, paired with a quantitative com-parison of prevailing senses. We therefore suggest to visualize word contexts in order to gain a better understanding of diachronic developments and also generate hypotheses for further investigations. In order to test our approach, we opted for a large corpus with a high temporal resolution. The New York Times Annotated Corpus with 1.8 million newspaper articles from 1987 to 2007 has a rather small time depth of 20 years but provides a time stamp for the exact publication date. Therefore, changes can be tracked on a daily basis.

The data processing involved context extraction, vector space creation, and sense modeling. As Sch  X  utze (1998) showed, looking at a context win-dow of 25 words before and after a key word pro-vides enough information in order to disambiguate word senses. Each extracted context is comple-mented with the time stamp from the corpus. To reduce the dimensionality, all context words were lemmatized and stop words were filtered out. For the set of all contexts of a key word, a global LDA model was trained using the MALLET toolkit 2 (McCallum, 2002). Each context is assigned to its most probable topic/sense, complemented by a spe-cific point on the time scale according to its time stamp from the corpus. Contexts for which the high-est probability was less than 40% were omitted be-cause they could not be assigned to a certain sense unambiguously. The distribution of senses over time was then visualized. 3.1 Visualization Different visualizations provide multidimensional views on the data and yield a better understanding of the developments. While plotting every word oc-currence individually offers the opportunity to detect and inspect outliers, aggregated views on the data are able to provide insights on overall developments.
Figure 1 provides a view where the percentages of word contexts belonging to different senses are plot-ted over time. For the verbs to browse and to surf seven senses are learned with LDA . Each sense cor-responds to one row and is described by the top five terms identified by LDA . The higher the gray area at a certain x-axis point, the more of the contexts of the corresponding year belong to the specific sense. Each shade of gray represents 10% of the overall data, i.e., three shades of gray mean that between 20% and 30% of the contexts can be attributed to that sense. For each year one value has been gener-ated and values between two years are linearly inter-polated.

Figure 2 shows the development of contexts over time, with each context plotted individually. The more recent the context, the darker the color. 3 Each axis represents one sense of to browse , in each sub-figure different combinations of senses are plotted. A random jitter has been introduced to avoid over-laps. Contexts in the middle (not the lower left cor-ner, but the middle of the graph, e.g., see e vs. f ) belong to both senses with at least 40% probabil-ity. Senses that share many ambiguous contexts are usually similar. By mousing over a colored dot, its context is shown, allowing for an in depth analysis. 3.2 Case studies In order to be able to judge the effectiveness of our new approach, we chose key words that are likely candidates for a change in use in the time from 1987 to 2007. That is, we concentrated on terms relat-ing to the relatively recent introduction of the inter-net. The advantage of these terms is that the cause of change can be located precisely in time.

Figure 1 shows the temporal sense development of the verbs to browse and to surf , together with the descriptive terms for each sense. Sense e for to browse and sense k for to surf pattern quite similarly. Inspecting their contexts reveals that both senses ap-pear with the invention of web browsers, peaking shortly after the introduction of Netscape Navigator (1994). For to browse , another broader sense (sense f ) concerning browsing in both the internet and dig-ital media collections shows a continuous increase over time, dominating in 2007.

The first occurrences assigned to sense f in 1987 are  X  X rowse data bases X ,  X  X ord-by-word brows-ing X  in databases and  X  X rowsing files in the cen-ter X  X  library X , referring to physical files, namely pho-tographs. We speculate that the sense of browsing physical media might haven given rise to the sense which refers to browsing electronic media, which in turn becomes the dominating sense with the advent of the web.

Figure 2 shows pairwise comparisons of word senses with respect to the contexts they share, i.e., contexts that cannot unambiguously be assigned to one or the other. Each context is represented by one dot colored according to its time stamp. It can be seen that senses d (animals that browse) and e (browsing the web) share no contexts at all. Senses d (animals that browse) and f (browsing files) share only few contexts. In turn, senses e and f share a fair number of contexts, which is to be expected, as they are closely related. Single contexts, each rep-resented by a colored dot, can be inspected via a mouse roll over. This allows for an in-depth look at specific data points and a better understanding how the data points relate to a sense. In comparison, Table 1 shows the LSA dimensions learned from the contexts of the verb to browse . The top five associated terms for each dimension have been extracted as descriptor. The dimensions are heavily dominated by senses strongly represented in the corpus (e.g., browsing the web). Infrequent senses (e.g., animals that browse) only occur in very low-ranked dimensions and are mixed with other senses (see the bold term deer in dimension 15). We compared the findings provided by our visual-ization with word sense information coming from various resources, namely the 2007 Collins dictio-nary ( COLL ), the English WordNet 4 ( WN ) (Fell-baum, 1998) and the Longman Dictionary ( LONG ) from 1987. Senses that evolved later than 1987 should not appear in LONG , but should appear in later dictionaries.

However, we are well aware that dictionaries are by no means good gold standards as lexicogra-phers themselves vary greatly when assigning word senses. Nevertheless, this comparison can provide a first indication as to whether the results of our tool is in line with other methods of identifying senses.
In the case of to browse , COLL and WordNet suggest the senses  X  X hopping around; not necessar-ily buying X ,  X  X eed as in a meadow or pasture X  and  X  X rowse a computer directory, surf the internet or the world wide web. X  These senses are also identified in our visualizations, which even additionally differen-tiate between the senses of  X  X rowsing the web X  and  X  X rowsing a computer directory. X  A WordNet sense that cannot be detected in the data is the meaning  X  X o eat lightly and try different dishes. X 
Table 2 shows the results of comparing dictionary word senses ( DIC ) with the results from our visual-ization ( VIS ). What can be seen is that our method is able to track semantic change diachronically and in the majority of cases, the number of our senses correspond to the information coming from the dic-tionaries. In some cases we are even more accurate in discriminating them. In the case of  X  X essenger X , the visualizations suggest another sense related to  X  X nstant messaging X  that arises with the advent of the AOL instant messenger in 1997. This leads us to the conclusion that our method is appropriate from a historical linguistic point of view. When dealing with a complex phenomenon such as semantic change, one has to be aware of the limita-tions of an automatic approach in order to be able to draw the right conclusions from its results. The first results of the case studies presented in this pa-per show that LDA is useful for distinguishing dif-ferent word senses on the basis of word contexts and performs better than LSA for this task. Further, it has been demonstrated by exemplary cases that the emergence of a new word sense can be detected by our new methodology
One of the main reasons for an interactive visu-alization approach is the possibility of being able to detect conspicuous patterns at-a-glance, yet at the same time being able to delve into the details of the data by zooming in on the occurrences of particu-lar words in their contexts. This makes it possible to compensate for one of the major disadvantages of generative and vector space models, namely their functioning as  X  X lack boxes X  whose results cannot be tracked easily.

The biggest problem in dealing with a corpus-based method of detecting meaning change is the availability of suitable corpora. First, computing se-mantic information on the basis of contexts requires a large amount of data in order to be able to infer re-liable results. Second, the words in the context from which the meanings will be distinguished should be both semantically and orthographically stable over time so that comparisons between different stages in the development of the language can be made. Un-fortunately, both requirements are not always met. On the one hand words do change their meaning, after all this is what the present study is all about. However, we assume that the meanings in a certain context window are stable enough to infer reliable results provided it is possible that the forms of the same words in different periods can be linked. This of course limits the applicability of the approach to smaller time ranges due to changes in the phonetic form of words. Moreover, in particular for older pe-riods of the language, different variants for the same word, either due to sound changes or different (or rather no) spelling conventions, abound. For now, we circumvent this problem by testing our tool on corpora where the drawbacks of historical texts are less severe but at the same time interesting develop-ments can be detected to prove our approach correct.
For future research, we want to test our methodol-ogy on a broader range of terms, texts and languages and develop novel interactive visualizations to aid investigations in two ways. As a first aim, the user should be allowed to check the validity and quality of the visualizations by experimenting with param-eter settings and inspecting their outcome. Second, the user is supposed to gain a better understanding of semantic change by interactively exploring a corpus.
