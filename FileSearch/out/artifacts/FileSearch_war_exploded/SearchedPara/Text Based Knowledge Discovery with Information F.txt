 There has been ever expanding vast amount of information published and accessible on the WWW, which provides new opportunities for mining the web to discover useful information. For example, a research er searches the bibliographic databases to obtain possible solutions or useful hints from other people X  X  published work in order knowledge connecting the problem with some yet unknown possible solution. This kind of hidden connection is referred to as  X  X ndiscovered public knowledge X  by Swanson [14]. Swanson X  X  serendipitous literature-based discovery of a cure for Raynaud X  X  disease by dietary fish oils illustrates this phenomenon. The literature documenting Raynaud X  X  disease and literature surrounding fish oil were disjoint. Had these communities been aware of each other, a cure would probably been found much earlier than Swanson X  X  chance discovery. 
Similarly, Barwise and Seligman [1] use a term  X  X nformation flow X  for the relation process of uncovering implicit information to as informational inference. Humans fragments, e.g., document titles. For example, with web page titles  X  X elcome to Penguin Books X  and  X  X ntarctic Penguin X , the term  X  X enguin X  within these two short, black animal living in the ice-cold Antarctic. The process of making such  X  X boutness X  judgments has been referred to as informational inference [12]. An information inference mechanism has been proposed which automatically computes information flow through a high dimensional conceptual space [11] [12]. Each information flow is a reflection of how strongly Y is informationally contained within the explicit term associations via co-occurrence relationships used in traditional information processing systems. For example,  X  X ird X  is an information flow derived from  X  X ntarctic Penguin X , even if it may never co-occur with  X  X enguin X  in a document collection. Information flow can be considered as a special form of documents into different categories, e.g.,  X  X ublisher X ,  X  X irds X , etc., by scanning their titles, instead of spending much time browsing and reading the whole articles. Suppose a user is only interested in the bird penguin. He can then simply filter out the documents about penguin publisher. 
The information flow analysis is based on Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) vector representations, which reflect s the lexical co-occurrence information of terms [4] [9]. Words are represented as vectors in a high dimensional semantic space automatically derived from a text corpus. Research from cognitive science has demonstrated the cognitive compatibility of HAL representations with human processing. Information flow computation between vectors is proposed as a means of suggesting potentially interesting implicit associations between concepts. 
In this paper we offer the fundamentals of a knowledge discovery mechanism based on information flow analysis. Two case studies are presented, using the Swanson X  X  Raynaud-Fish Oil discovery (Section 3), and unsupervised category develop automated information discovery devices for enabling people to have their awareness enhanced. 2.1 Representing Information in High Dimensional Conceptual Space How can information, or concepts, be represented and processed in a full, rich-in-cognitive model on  X  X onceptual space X , which is built upon geometric structures representing concepts and properties [6]. In the conceptual level, information is represented geometrically in terms of a dimensional space. Recent investigations on lexical semantic space models open a door to realize Gardenfors X  conceptual spaces theory. Huma ns encountering a new concept derive the meaning via an accumulation of experience of the contexts in which the concept appears. The meaning of a word is captu red by examining its co-occurrence patterns major classes of semantic space models: document spaces and word spaces. The paragraphs, etc) in which they appear. A notable example is the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) [8]. The latter represents words as vector spaces of other words, which occur with the target words within a certain distance (e.g., a window size). The weighting scheme can be inversely proportional to the distance between the context and target words. The Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) model employs this each other in meaning. For example, nurse and doctor are similar in semantics to each other, as they always experience the same contexts, i.e., hospital, patients, etc. 
The semantic space models have demonstrated cognitive compatibility with human processing. For example, Burgess and Lund showed via cognitive experiments that  X  X uman participants were able to use the context neighbourhoods that HAL generates to match words with similar items and to derive the word (or a similar word) from the neighbourhood, thus demonstrating the cognitive compatibility of the representations with human processing X  [4]. 2.2 Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) Song and Bruza [11] [12] proposed to use the HAL vectors to prime the geometric representations inherent to G X rdenfors X  conceptual spaces. 
Given an n -word vocabulary, the HAL space is a n x n matrix constructed by moving a window of length L over the corpus by one word increment ignoring 
This example demonstrates how a word is represented as a weighted vector whose dimensions comprise other words. The weights represent the strengths of association between  X  X aynaud X  and other words seen in the context of the sliding window: the higher the weight of a word, the more it has lexically co-occurred with  X  X aynaud X  in the same context(s). The quality of HAL vectors is influenced by the window size: the longer the window, the higher the chance of representing spurious associations between terms. A window size of eight or ten has been used in various studies reported in this paper. 
More formally, a concept c is a vector representation: &gt; &lt; = and termed a property if its weight is greater than zero. A property p i of a concept c is a termed a quality property iff  X  &gt;  X  denote the set of quality properties of concept c . QP  X  (c) will be used to denote the set of quality properties above mean value, and QP(c) is short for QP 0 (c) . Computing Information Flow in HAL Spaces Information flow between two concepts is computed as a degree of inclusion (  X  ) of the source vector in the target vector. As HAL vectors are not perfect representations of the associated concepts, the computation is done based on how many dimensions of one concept are present in another co ncept. Total inclusion leads to maximum information flow. Definition HAL-based information flow where i c denotes the conceptual representation of token i , and  X  is a threshold value. (  X  representation representing the combined co ncept. Details of a concept combination heuristic can be found in [2]. properties of c i and c j to the number of quality properties in the source c i : degree( c important quality properties of c produces truly inferential character, i.e., concept j need not be a property dimension of An important type of information discovery is the scientific discovery, which is also an inference process. Swanson (1986) proposed a concept of  X  X ndiscovered public knowledge X  [14]. Two originally unconnected phenomena A and C could be linked via some intermediate B. When some relationship between A and B is found in a number of research papers while some kind of relationship between C and B can also be found, the  X  X ndiscovered public knowledge X  that there is some kind of relationship between A and C can then be established. Swanson successfully discovered the hidden connection between  X  X aynaud X  X  disease X  and  X  X ish oil X  via intermediate concepts  X  X lood viscosity X ,  X  X latelet Aggregation X , etc. from the MEDLINE. Gordon and Dumais [7] used Latent Semantic Indexing to simulate Swanson X  X  discovery, but the results are disappointing  X  no fish oil was explicitly discovered. Weeber et al. [16] developed a semi-automatic system with a set of NLP and semantic processing tools to simulate Swanson X  X  discovery. However, a lot of human interactions are involved. For example, they both need to download the articles containing  X  X aynaud disease X  first. Terms co-occurring frequently with  X  X aynaud disease X  are then filtered and ranked. A number of them are manually selected to serve as intermediate B-terms. For order to find the corresponding C-terms. Note that it is not necessary that  X  X ish oil X  is ranked among the top C-terms  X  the goal is to help experts to obtain important hints to model are very close  X  this provides the po ssibility to replicate the Raynaud-Fish Oil discovery automatically or with minimal human involvement. 3.1 Experimental Setup Our experiment is run on 111,603 MEDLINE core clinic journal articles during 1980-large amount of hints of that. Only document titles are used. After dropping a list of stop words used in Swanson X  X  ARROWSMITH system, the resulting size of vocabulary is 28834. 
We have two runs using our information flow model to derive information flow from term  X  X aynaud X . The first run is fully automatic. In the second run, we manually dimensions  X  X lood X  and  X  X latelet X  value of 1.0 and other dimensions ( X  X ggregation X ,  X  X rythrocyte X ,  X  X lasma X ,  X  X emorheleology X ,  X  X low X ,  X  X yperviscosity X ,  X  X ascular X , dimensional weight of the  X  X aynaud X  vector. These dimensions originate from the B-terms documented in [13]. The resultant vector (denoted  X  X aynaud+ X ) was then normalized. The second run emulates the case where a researcher manually enhances the automatically derived HAL vector for  X  X aynaud X  motivated from their specific expertise and interest. 
Some highly weighted dimensions (above average) of the original  X  X aynaud X  vector and the  X  X aynaud+ X  are listed below for illustration: 3.2 Experimental Results Raynaud and Raynaud+ are shown in table 4. The number in brackets following each derived term is its ranking. Discussion It is promising that HAL-based information flow (Raynaud+) has established a connection between the term  X  X aynaud X  and terms suggesting  X  X ish oil X  such as  X  X il X , edges are relationships between terms. Table 5 depicts a fragment of the output after the information flows of the Raynaud+ vector have been projected. The score on the separate power index expressions. The scores next to individual terms reflect the degree of information flow. 
The next case study shows how information flow analysis can be sued to derive categories from short textual document titles. In situations involving large amounts of incoming electronic information (e.g., defense intelligence), judgments about content (whether by automatic or manual means) are sometimes performed based simply on a title description or brief caption documents. 
The task of automatic Text Categorization (TC) is to assign a number of pre-defined category labels to a document by learning a classification scheme from a set investigated, such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Na X ve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Network (NN), etc. They make use of the manually pre-assigned categories associated with the training documents. However, many example, pre-defined categories and labeled training may not be available. As a consequence, unsupervised techniques are required. In data intensive domains section, we apply the information flow analysis to unsupervised category learning and document title classification, where the information flow theory introduced in Section 2 allows information classification to be considered in terms of information inference. Consider the terms n i i , , 1 K being drawn from the title of an incoming document D to be classified. The concept combina tion heuristic can be used to obtain a term j is sufficiently high, j can be assigned to D as a category . For example,  X  X rade X  is inferred from  X  X ATT TALKS X  with a high degree 0.96. The document titled  X  X  X ATT TALKS X  can then be classified with category  X  X rade X . 4.1 Experimental Setup selected from the total 120 Reuters topics. The 14,688 training documents are generate the HAL space, from which the topic information flows can be derived. As which belong to at least one of the 17 sel ected topics, are extracted. With respect the below 10 relevant titles. The average number of relevant document titles over the 14 topics is 107. We choose this set of topics because they vary from the most frequently used topics in Reuters collection like  X  X cquisition X  (Note that we use the real English to some rarely used ones such as  X  X ye X . 
The test titles are indexed using the document term frequency and inverse collection frequency components of the Okapi BM-25 formula. 4.2 Experimental Results Since it is still at its early stage of this research, we do not compare the performance with other text categorization models using the micro and macro averaged precision, and recall and precision break-even point measures. Our purpose at the moment is to 0.79, R-precision: 0.45, Average Recall: 1418/1498). Further refinement and comparison with other models will be left as our future work. A consequence of the explosion of information is diminishing awareness: disciplines are becoming increasingly specialized; in dividuals and groups are becoming ever more insular. This paper considered how awareness can be enhanced via text-based knowledge discovery. 
Information flow computation through a high dimensional semantic space is able to simulate Swanson X  X  Raynaud-fish oil discovery, if the dimensional representation of Raynaud is manually enhanced by increasing weights corresponding to salient aspects of Raynaud X  X  disease. The amount of enhancement is small, and the character of the enhancements is within the sphere of knowledge appropriate to a researcher in Raynaud X  X  disease. On the other hand, the information flow analysis also demonstrates a promising performance in category learning from document titles. It should be noted that the connections information flow model establishes can be indirect. In short, we feel that there is so me justification to be encouraged that HAL-based information flow can function as a logic of discovery [5]. 
The goal of such a logic is to produce hypotheses. Future work will be directed discussion of awareness, HAL-based information flow has the potential to enhance awareness by producing hypotheses (e.g., raynaud disease -fish oil; Gatt talks -trade) that the human researcher would never consider or easily ignore.
