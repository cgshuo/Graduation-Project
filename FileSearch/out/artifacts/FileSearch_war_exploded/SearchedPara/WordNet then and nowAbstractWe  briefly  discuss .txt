 George A. Miller  X  Christiane Fellbaum Abstract We briefly discuss the origin and development of WordNet, a large lexical database for English. We outline its design and contents as well as its usefulness for Natural Language Processing. Finally, we discuss crosslinguistic WordNets and complementary lexical resources.

The original idea was to understand the learning process by simulating it and perhaps find ways to facilitate word learning. Fortunately, children are efficient word learners and the failure of our effort to understand the process was of no consequence. But our attempt to simulate the acquisition of lexical meaning led us to some interesting discoveries about relations between and among words (Miller 1990 , 1995 ; Fellbaum 1998 ).

There are two major approaches to the semantic analysis of words. Componential analysis is characterized by the inclusion of generic concepts into more specific ones. For example, the concept expressed by murder is said to include the concept expressed by kill.

In the 1970s various forms of componential analysis became popular in linguistics and psychology, but they seemed to be limited to a small subset of the vocabulary (for example, the analysis in terms of so-called semantic markers proposed by Katz and Fodor 1963 ). More recently, linguists have tried to show the existence of lexicalization patterns in terms of component analysis (Levin 1993 ; Rappaport and Levin 1998 ; Talmy 1985 ), based on the hypothesis that word meanings are systematically built up from atomic meaning components. Wierzbicka ( 1996 ) argues that a small number of components suffice to account for the semantics of a universal core lexicon.

An alternative approach to word meaning is relational semantics, which merely relates words without assuming anything about composition or semantic inclusion. We decided to base our simulation on relational semantics, following guidance provided by Woods ( 1975 ) and by the lexicologist Lawrence Urdang (personal communication). For example, car and vehicle can be thought of as labels for two nodes in a semantic network; an arc between them represents the proposition a car is expressing the fact that a tire is a part of a car, and, via inheritance, a part of all kinds of cars, such as trucks and convertibles. IS-A-KIND-OF and IS-A-PART-OF are semantic relations that holds between many pairs of word concepts, as are IS-AN-ANTONYM-OF and ENTAILS. These, and their inverses, are the basic semantic relations that structure WordNet into a large network of linguistically labeled nodes.

Each node consists of one or more words that are  X  X  X ognitively synonymous X  X  (Cruse 1986 ). That is to say, the words are denotationally equivalent and can be substituted for one another in many, but not all, contexts. Substitution does not change the truth value of the proposition in which the word is embedded. The groups of synonymous words are dubbed synonym sets, or  X  X  X ynsets. X  X 
Initially, WordNet contained only nouns, the part of speech that many psychologists have in mind when they refer to  X  X  X ords. X  X  Verbs and adjectives were added later, and some adverbs entered the database in the 1990s. The synsets for each part of speech were entered separately, resulting in four independent networks. 2 WordNet and ontology Occasionally, users of WordNet refer to WordNet as a lexical ontology because it incorporates some of the ontological relations known at least since Aristotle. But we never thought of WordNet as an ontology and so were not concerned with following ontological  X  X  X est practice. X  X 
WordNet was originally constructed with 25 unique beginners, rather that a single root node. Most ontologists would agree that it is sensible to have a single class of all entities X  X  X eal, abstract or imagined. Repeated requests to merge the 25 initial trees were finally met and WordNet now provides a single unique beginner, labeled  X  X  X ntity. X  X 
Second, WordNet did not distinguish between Types (classes) and Instances. So  X  X  X  nation IS A KIND OF political unit X  X  and  X  X  X pain IS A KIND OF nation X  X  were represented in the same way. But nations are a class and Spain is an instance of that class.
By working through all the nouns in WordNet, this distinction was finally drawn (Miller and Hristea 2006 ).
 Currently, formal ontology is a very active field of research as it is important for Knowledge Representation and Management (see, e.g., Gangemi et al. 2003 ; Niles and Pease 2001 ). As ontologies tend to confine themselves to higher-level concepts, a mapping to a lexical resource is desirable as it extends the concepts covered by the ontology down into the  X  X  X eaves X  X  of the hierarchies. The Suggested Upper Merged Ontology, or SUMO, (Niles and Pease 2003 ) has been fully linked to WordNet as well as to WordNets of other languages. 3 WordNet as an NLP tool Some 21 years after we started, the WordNet lexical database has become a tool widely used by the NLP community for applications including Information Retrieval and Machine Translation, which all require Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). But WordNet X  X  effectiveness for WSD is limited by the sparsity of its arcs. We tried to  X  X  X orphosemantic links X  X  (Fellbaum and Miller 2003 ). For example, the verb interest is connected to the appropriate senses of the noun interest and the adjective interesting.
Since the noun has several meanings X  X  X ot all of them related to the adjective sense X  X  X he links had to be entered manually among the appropriate senses.

Adding more connections among WordNet X  X  synsets and words means adding information about their meaning, which is useful for human and machine users. synset, were manually disambiguated against WordNet senses. In this way, a user who wishes to better understand a gloss can refer to the synsets for more information on the nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs in that gloss. Moreover, this work resulted in the creation of a semantically annotated corpus (the glosses) that can be used to train and test machine learning systems for WSD. 1 Boyd-Graber et al. ( 2006 ) represents another effort to increase the density of WordNet and make it a more efficient tool for NLP. 120,000 ratings were collected from human annotators that capture the strength with which a concept (expressed by one WordNet synset) evokes that expressed by a second synset. Unlike the present arcs in WordNet, the evocation links are both directed and weighted, expressing more differentiated semantic relations. Not surprisingly, about two thirds of the ratings were zero, reflecting the fact that most concepts are semantically unrelated. The current challenge is to train a machine learning system to bootstrap the remaining arcs throughout much of the network. 4 Going global In the 1990s, Piek Vossen from the University of Amsterdam undertook the construction of WordNets in eight European languages (Vossen 1998 ; Tufis 2004 ). The new WordNets were interlinked via the Princeton WordNet, which served as the repository of all concepts expressed in at least one of the EuroWordNet languages, an Interlingual Index. EuroWordNet introduced some major design changes, among them new semantic and lexical relations that may be specific to individual languages.

As WordNets for more and more languages were built, the importance of coordination and the potential for linkage grew. Vossen and Fellbaum founded the Global WordNet Organization in 2000 with the express goal of guiding WordNet development and ensuring intercommunicability. Biannual meetings bring together the international WordNet community to report on the development of databases and to present results of WordNet-related applied and theoretical research. Currently, WordNets exist in some 40 languages, including dead languages like Sanskrit and Latin and genetically and typologically unrelated languages such as Basque, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Estonian, and Turkish 2 .

Mapping the lexicons for many languages constitutes a significant challenge, in part because the definition of a word or lexical unit becomes less certain as we consider how languages with different morphological and syntactic properties encode concepts. Fellbaum and Vossen ( 2007 ) attempt to lay out a framework for a  X  X  X lobal Grid X  X  that defines a universal core lexical inventory and establishes guidelines for its crosslinguistic encoding. 5 WordNet in the community The first WordNet database (version 1.0) was released in 1991, and the response by the NLP community took us by surprise. WordNet 3.0 was released at the end of 2007; a number of intermediate versions were distributed, each including improvements and enrichments. Currently, WordNet is being downloaded about 8,000 times daily. The Google  X  X  X efine X  X  command brings up WordNet X  X  glosses and example sentences, reflecting its popularity beyond the NLP user community.
Members of the WordNet community exchange news, offer software, articulate their needs for specific improvements and point out errors and omissions via a mailing list.

Among the many applications that WordNet has seen, the most exciting ones currently include Question Answering and Reasoning and Inferencing 3 .

Spawned by the growing need for better Natural Language Understanding on the one hand, and renewed interest in the lexicon as field of linguistic inquiry on the other hand, a number of lexical resources have been developed over the past decade. Some are intended to address WordNet X  X  perceived shortcomings; others offer alternative or complementary kinds of information, such as FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al. 2002 ) and PropBank (Palmer et al. 2005 ). Harmonization of resources can ensure compatibility and communication among the various resources while avoiding duplication of considerable cost and effort.
The annotation of WordNet X  X  senses with additional information, such as subjectivity (Wilson et al. 2006 ) and temporal relations among events (Pustejovsky et al. 2003 ) could greatly enrich WordNet X  X  usefulness. WordNet X  X  sense inventory, considered overly fine-grained by many WSD systems, was created before the availability of freely available large corpora. Annotation against a corpus such as the American National Corpus (Ide et al. 2002 ) will serve as a useful check of WordNet X  X  coverage.

WordNet aims to serve the community and to continue to be of interest to colleagues with both symbolic and statistical perspectives on language.
