 Optimization tools are vital to data analysis and learning. The optimization perspective has provided valuable insights, and optimization formulations have led to practical algo-rithms with good theoretical properties. In turn, the rich collection of problems in learning and data analysis is pro-viding fresh perspectives on optimization algorithms and is driving new fundamental research in the area. We discuss research on several areas in this domain, including signal re-construction, manifold learning, and regression/classification, describing in each case recent research in which optimization algorithms have been developed and applied successfully. A particular focus is asynchronous parallel algorithms for op-timization and linear algebra, and their applications in data analysis and learning.
 G.1.6 [ Numerical Analysis ]: Optimization Algorithms Optimization; Learning Stephen J. Wright is a Professor of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His research is on com-putational optimization and its applications to many areas of science and engineering. Prior to joining UW-Madison in 2001, Wright was a Senior Computer Scientist at Ar-gonne National Laboratory (1990-2001), and a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago (2000-2001). During 2007-2010, he served as chair of the Mathematical Optimization Society, and is on the Board of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). He is a Fellow of SIAM.
