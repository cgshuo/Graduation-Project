 1. Introduction
In today X  X  dynamic organizational environment, work has become increasingly knowledge-intensive. The acquisition and use of knowledge and information by employees is, therefore, regarded as an indispensable skill for organizational success for instance, been found to affect employees X  levels of knowledge, their job performance and their ability to cope with uncer-tainty in tasks ( Hart &amp; Rice, 1991; Leckie, Pettigrew, &amp; Sylvain, 1996; Vakkari, 2003 ). Groups in which there is a higher awareness of  X  X  X ho knows what X  X , or a well-developed  X  X  X ransactive memory system X  X  ( Wegner, 1986 ) have been found to out-perform groups without such systems, and this awareness has been found to positively influence actual information retrieval study of information seeking and retrieval is of great pragmatic importance for individuals and organizations, as well as of academic interest to information processing and management research. In this paper, we aim to contribute to this area of research by identifying the underlying dimensions of two variables that have consistently been found to influence informa-tion seeking and retrieval: quality and accessibility of an information source.

Much research points out that, in general, people have a preference for human information sources over documents, dat-2002 ), especially when seeking problem-specific information ( Savolainen, 2008 ). Information source selection research has found that, in selecting such sources, two considerations are leading the information seeker: the expected quality of the  X  source X  X  information ( Choo, Detlor, &amp; Turnbull, 2000; Hertzum, 2002; Kremer, 1980; Vancouver &amp; Morrison, 1995 ), and the
However, the relative importance of quality and accessibility in source selection in organizations is subject to debate: studies on information source selection have found contradictory results regarding the role of quality and accessibility. We argue that this lack of cohesive results is for a large part due to a lack of consistency in conceptualization and operationalization of the key constructs of quality and accessibility.

By integrating insights from social capital theory in the source selection research stream, this paper aims to overcome this shortcoming for the selection of human information sources. By unpacking the concepts of quality and accessibility into dimensions derived from social capital theory, this paper aims to contribute to a better appreciation of what influences the use of human information sources in organizations. So far, social capital and information seeking have existed as rather independent fields of research, whereas it may be beneficial to combine insights from both lines of research. Such integration may help to resolve the persisting lack of consistency in definitions and measures of accessibility and quality. In addition, overcoming this confusion may enlighten the empirical contradictions in source selection studies focusing on human infor-mation sources.

In the next sections of this paper, we integrate literature on source selection with social capital research. Based on this integration, a new theoretical framework to study the role of accessibility vs. quality in the selection of human information sources in organizational settings is presented. Using this integrative framework, a field experiment was conducted to estab-lish the relative effect of accessibility and quality on the likelihood of exchanging information between employees. The re-sults of this experiment indicate that information source quality consists of two dimensions (relevance and reliability), while information source accessibility consists of three dimensions (physical, cognitive and relational accessibility). Furthermore, the findings offer support for the conclusion that quality and accessibility are both important in explaining information seek-ing and retrieval, and that the influence of quality is slightly stronger. 2. Social capital and source selection
Employees X  information needs regularly initiate information flows within organizations. When confronted with such information needs, employees usually have numerous people to turn to in organizations. Two separate literatures provide important insights into the criteria employees use when deciding whom to ask for information. The first research stream concerns studies of source selection in organizations. These are discussed in the next section. 2.1. Source selection research
When seeking information, people can use various information sources. In general, they may be defined as  X  X  X hysical (digital) entities in a variety of media providing potential information, data or signs that, when perceived, may affect and form of non-relational (also known as non-people) sources such as websites, periodicals/journals, TV programs, and internal ested in the question of what makes people decide to use a particular information source. When research on source selection started, studies initially found that only the perceived accessibility of a source  X  the time and effort costs involved in gaining access to the physical carrier of information and the information in it ( Marton &amp; Choo, 2002; Woudstra, 2005 )  X  played a role in such decisions ( Gerstberger &amp; Allen, 1968; Rosenberg, 1967 ) as opposed to perceived source quality which is seen to refer to the value or benefits of the content of the information in a source ( Allen, 1969; Fidel &amp; Green, 2004; Hardy, 1982 ).
Since then, studies  X  by letting respondents rank or rate sources from a given list in relation to each variable (see e.g., Hardy, ing people on the role both factors play in a person X  X  professional source selection behavior (see e.g., Fidel &amp; Green, 2004 ) X  have established a role of source quality in source selection in addition to source accessibility. The results of these studies are, however, inconsistent with regard to which factor prevails. Some find both factors to matter, but accessibility to be most 2006; Zimmer &amp; Henry, 2007 ), influence. The question is how these inconsistent research findings can be explained.
One potential explanation lies in the existing conceptual confusion regarding source accessibility and quality. Insofar as the general constructs are agreed upon (see definitions above), their further operationalization has proven difficult and elu-sive. The concepts are either considered self-explanatory so that respondents apply their own meanings when ranking or rating information sources ( Fidel &amp; Green, 2004 ) or researchers have very diverse interpretations at an operational level of what accessibility and quality are and are not . Not only are many different operationalizations used for the costs and ben-efits included in accessibility and quality (see Table 1 for an overview), authors also do not agree on which types of costs and benefits to include. Different types of costs and benefits relate to different dimensions of accessibility and quality, as illus-trated in Table 1 .

For example, some authors restrict their interpretation of accessibility to costs that exclusively refer to the physical ease and speed with which a source can be made available for use ( Kremer, 1980 ), relating to the time and physical activity that an information seeker has to invest in order to reach and access the source. Others, however, interpret accessibility as a broader concept, including for example the psychological or intellectual effort involved in obtaining information from the source ( Marton &amp; Choo, 2002 ), or social costs such as feeling uncomfortable revealing a lack of knowledge to a source ( Fidel &amp; Green, 2004 ). However, agreement is lacking on which dimensions this broader concept exactly includes (as we explain in greater detail in the next section).

So far, however, source selection research is not very attentive to the multiple costs and benefits associated with both accessibility and quality, and even less to attempts to find a common thread. Essentially, due to this lack of attention for the poor conceptualization and operationalization of source accessibility and quality, researchers are looking at and drawing conclusions from different construals. For a further advancement of the field, it is necessary to come to a common under-standing of what accessibility and quality entail.

In the present study, we seek to address this gap. The central research focus of this paper is to examine underlying dimen-sions of perceived accessibility and quality of human information sources. Based on these dimensions, a second goal is to examine the relative importance of accessibility and quality in the selection of human information sources. Therefore, the research questions guiding our research are the following:
RQ1: Which underlying dimensions can be identified in the concept of source accessibility in relation to the selection of human information sources in an intra-organizational context?
RQ2: Which underlying dimensions can be identified in the concept of source quality in relation to the selection of human information sources in an intra-organizational context?
RQ3: What is the effect of source accessibility and source quality on the selection of human information sources in an intra-organizational context?
More insight into the dimensions underlying accessibility and quality is sought in the literature on social capital, which is discussed in the next section. 2.2. Social capital research The concept of social capital refers to the benefits people can derive from their social relationships ( Adler &amp; Kwon, 2002;
Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 1995; Tsai &amp; Ghoshal, 1998 ). Social capital comprises both the network and the assets that may be mobilized through that network ( Nahapiet &amp; Ghoshal, 1998 ). As information seeking is a fundamentally human and above all social process (particularly when it comes to seeking help from human information sources), it makes sense to take such a concerning who to turn to for information as  X  X  X ocial decisions X  X  due to the many social factors that play a role in these deci-sions. More specifically, we focus on the work of Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) in which they uncover the multidimension-ality of the social capital concept, thus attempting to end a lack of integration in definitions and operationalizations in the social capital field. Not only does their work seem fruitful for our purposes as we attempt to do the same in a different field, it is also particularly interesting because of its focus on the role of social capital in an organizational information sharing con-text and the fact that the two conditions for information exchange that Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) distinguish  X  access to others, and the value (or quality) of their information  X  are similar to the conditions that are identified in source selection research. For these reasons, we believe that their description of how these two conditions are influenced by various dimen-sions of social capital can help to shed some light on important points of debate in source selection research.
Nahapiet and Ghoshal distinguish three dimensions of social capital, the structural dimension (the overall pattern of con-nections between actors, who you know and how to reach them), the relational dimension (the kind of personal relationships people have, such as respect and friendship, that influence their behavior) and the cognitive dimension (shared representa-tion, interpretation, and systems of meaning). Based on these dimensions, it can be assumed that social capital can positively contribute to the process of information seeking by (1) providing access to people with relevant information or relevant needs and questions, (2) providing a common interest and an atmosphere of mutual trust and appreciation, and (3) sharing a  X  X ommon know-how X  which facilitates a mutual understanding of information being exchanged ( Nahapiet &amp; Ghoshal, 1998 ). Nahapiet and Ghoshal X  X  model helps to clarify whether accessibility and quality should be seen as one-dimensional or multidimensional concepts. Secondly, it assists in overcoming conflicts about which dimension(s) these two concepts do or do not include. 2.3. Social capital and dimensions of quality and accessibility 2.3.1. Accessibility
Based on Nahapiet and Ghoshal X  X  description of how different dimensions of social capital (the structural, relational and cognitive dimension) affect access to sources for information exchange, we identify three different dimensions of accessibil-ity: accessibility is believed to entail a physical, relational and cognitive dimension.

First of all, Nahapiet and Ghoshal, in discussing the structural dimension of social capital, hint, amongst other things, the importance of the required physical activity involved in gaining access for information exchange. The structural dimension of social capital refers to one X  X  network of relationships  X  who you know, and how to reach them  X  which helps workers to gain access). Through (a) one X  X  personal contacts (providing channels for information transmission), (b) their organization (affecting the efficiency of information exchange) and (c) the extent to which personal contacts that may have developed for other pur-poses can be used for information and knowledge exchange, the required effort and time to access others is reduced, which con-tributes to information exchange ( Nahapiet &amp; Ghoshal, 1998 ).

In source selection research, efficient access to a source  X  in terms of minimal barriers in both space (the distance that needs to be bridged to contact a source) and time (how long it takes to access a source)  X  is widely recognized as an impor-tant consideration in accessing information sources. Much attention has been paid to aspects such as co-workers X  physical proximity or the ease with which one can reach co-workers for an appointment ( Anderson, Glassman, McAfee, &amp; Pinelli, 2001; Kremer, 1980; Vancouver &amp; Morrison, 1995; Xu et al., 2006 ). What these aspects have in common is that they all refer to a physical dimension of accessibility: the physical activity  X  in terms of amount of effort or duration (time)  X  involved in gaining access to a source. However, Nahapiet and Ghoshal point out that accessibility relates to more than the physical dimension involved in accessing sources. Although the other two dimensions they distinguish (the relational and the cog-nitive dimension) are less often acknowledged as a part of accessibility in source selection research, they are at least as important in explaining the selection of human information sources. These other two dimensions are discussed in more de-tail in the following paragraphs.

The relational dimension of social capital refers to resources such as trust, obligations and norms that influence individ-uals X  engagement in exchanging resources ( Lesser &amp; Prusak, 2000 ). Access to human information sources may be hindered, for example, because employees do not feel comfortable revealing their lack of knowledge on a given topic to certain sources ( Borgatti &amp; Cross, 2003; Crant, 2000; Lee, 2002 ), may worry about the source not having time for them ( Allen, 1977 , p. 194) or do not like the extent to which some sources (e.g. because they are busy) make them feel indebted ( Borgatti &amp; Cross, 2003; ing a source. In many source selection studies, these considerations are excluded from the research all together ( Connelly,
Rich, Curley, &amp; Kelly, 1990; Kremer, 1980 ). Others do incorporate measures of relational issues concerning accessibility in tween humans is an inherently social process, it stands to reason that this relational dimension of source accessibility is a prominent issue in the selection of human information sources. Relational issues are an inherent part of human information source accessibility and thus should be included in this concept X  X  measures.

Finally, the cognitive dimension of social capital provides a perspective on accessibility from a cognitive standpoint. A cog-nitive dimension is included in some studies from the source selection tradition ( Curley et al., 1990; Kennedy et al., 1997; Xu et al., 2006 ), where authors argue that gaining access to a source does not only entail contacting and approaching a source, but also getting the desired information from that source after it has been contacted and approached ( Marton &amp; Choo, 2002 ).
This brings along intellectual or cognitive effort costs involved in understanding a source ( Curley et al., 1990 ). The cognitive dimension of social capital refers to resources such as a shared language and culture. Such cognitive resources embedded in one X  X  social relationships influence access to other X  X  information by affecting the effort needed to understand each other ( Huysman, 2004 ). This social embeddedness of cognitive resources and the resulting variation in cognitive resources X  under-standability means that the cognitive dimension is relevant for any kind of information source, including the selection of human information sources. The third and final dimension of accessibility, therefore, consists of cognitive aspects of acces-sibility. Together, these insights lead to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1. Source accessibility consists of a (a) physical, (b) relational and (c) cognitive dimension. 2.3.2. Quality
Similar to the previously presented discussions about accessibility, source selection researchers do not agree on whether source quality is a one-dimensional or multidimensional construct and which dimension(s) to include. In their analysis of how social capital facilitates value perceptions of a source X  X  information, Nahapiet and Ghoshal implicitly distinguish two different dimensions of source quality, thus seeing it as a multidimensional construct.

The cognitive dimension of social capital is related to a first dimension of quality. For information exchange to take place, parties involved should anticipate value to be created from that exchange. Nahapiet and Ghoshal claim that the value of a source X  X  information is more easily perceived when source and seeker share a common frame of reference or language, or social capital is a precondition. Information and knowledge are social constructs; they are actively constructed within a spe-cific context ( Nahapiet &amp; Ghoshal, 1998 ). As a result, what people observe and how they interpret this can differ across con-texts: what is relevant in one context may not be considered important in another context ( Cohen &amp; Levinthal, 1990;
Dougherty, 1992; Nahapiet &amp; Ghoshal, 1998 ). Thus, the first dimension of source quality we include in our conceptualization refers to the perceived relevance of the information the source is expected to provide. This connects to information source selection research that focuses on quality in terms of relevance, utility, etc. ( Chakrabarti, Feineman, &amp; Fuentevilla, 1983; Hardy, 1982 ).

Second, quality perceptions can be influenced by the relational dimension of social capital. As Nahapiet and Ghoshal ex-plain, trust (as an important aspect of relational social capital) is especially relevant in explaining the extent to which people combine and exchange intellectual capital (i.e., information and knowledge). Trust is a multidimensional construct that, among others, encompasses belief in others X  competence, capability and reliability ( Nahapiet &amp; Ghoshal, 1998, p. 254 ).
Focusing on human information sources, this relates to a source X  X  quality in terms of the reliability of the information they can provide. Strong social ties are required to be able to judge an information source X  X  reliability. When prior interactions are lacking, trust in the source X  X  reliability (e.g., based on demonstrated competence or expertise) has not yet evolved, possibly blocking information exchange. Thus, reliability is a second dimension of quality that needs to be included. This is in line with information source selection research that defines quality in terms such as reliability or antecedents of it (e.g., expertise or competence) ( Gerstberger &amp; Allen, 1968; Vancouver &amp; Morrison, 1995 ). This leads to our second hypothesis: Hypothesis 2. Source quality consists of a (a) relevance and (b) reliability dimension.

By integrating insights from social capital theory in source selection research, a coherent theoretical framework to study accessibility and quality has been developed. Source selection research has traditionally not been very attentive to and con-sistent in the use of multiple meanings associated with accessibility and quality. The insights presented above could help to end this situation by positing a clear theoretical framework that can be used to operationally define accessibility and quality.
Subsequently, based on consistent operationalizations of accessibility and quality, valid conclusions about their influence on source selection can be drawn.

To date, there have not been many studies that assess both the role of accessibility and quality using various dimensions, such as the ones we distinguish. There are, however, a few notable exceptions (see Fidel &amp; Green, 2004; Hertzum, 2002;
Woudstra &amp; Van den Hooff, 2008 ). In these studies, more open-ended research techniques are used that allow for an exam-ination of the role of accessibility and quality in all their dimensions. Findings provide evidence that both accessibility and quality considerations play a role in human information source selection within an organizational context. The synthesis of the literature on source selection that was discussed in the previous section also provides support for the expectation that both accessibility and source quality will affect source selection. Hypothesis 3. Source accessibility positively affects the likelihood of asking a human information source for information. Hypothesis 4. Source quality positively affects the likelihood of asking a human information source for information.
Although our previous discussion would not lead to a concrete assumption with regard to which of the two variables is more important, it is specifically the more recent work that finds quality to be the more important influence  X  or even the only important influence ( Marton &amp; Choo, 2002; Xu et al., 2006; Zimmer &amp; Henry, 2007 ). More importantly, the studies employing a more multidimensional conceptualization of both concepts also find quality considerations to be more impor-tant than accessibility when choosing between human information sources ( Fidel &amp; Green, 2004; Hertzum, 2002; Woudstra &amp; Van den Hooff, 2008 ). 3 Based on these studies, we predict the following:
Hypothesis 5. Source quality has a stronger effect on the likelihood of asking a human information source for information than source accessibility. 3. Methods 3.1. Sample and design
To empirically test the proposed hypotheses, a scenario experiment was conducted within a large Dutch governmental organization. For organizational research, an experiment within an organizational setting is more appropriate than a labo-ratory experiment, combining (part of) the controllability of an experiment with (part of) the generalizability of a case study ( Logan &amp; Ganster, 2005; Schwenk, 1982 ). In this study, we chose to conduct an experiment on source selection in an orga-nizational setting, using 88 employees (55 men, 33 women). They participated in the experiment in return for a small gift (gadget). Subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental conditions. The experiment had a 2 (accessibility: high vs. low) 2 (quality: high vs. low) factorial design. 3.2. Procedure
Each participant received two envelopes which contained instructions about the experiment and a scenario: descriptions of hypothetical situations to which the subjects were asked to respond. An advantage of this approach is that it clearly de-fines the context in which the phenomenon under study takes place so that statements are not made in a social vacuum.
Instead, a frame of reference is established within which participants can more reliably rate information sources ( Rosenberg, 1967; Xu et al., 2006 ). In previous research, questions were usually asked using mass questionnaires, only allowing probes about information seeking behavior in general, making it necessary for participants to abstract perceptions from highly var-iable experiences ( De Alwis, Majid, &amp; Chaudry, 2006; Fidel &amp; Green, 2004 ). However, since the characteristics of the de-scribed situation might affect the outcomes, two different scenarios were designed for the present study, and randomly distributed.

Across the two scenarios, the introductory paragraph varied. The introductory paragraph of the first scenario asked par-ticipants to imagine that they worked as a policy-maker in their organization and were part of a knowledge management project that had recently been formed.

In order to contribute to the design of a knowledge management strategy, the participant needed to find a co-worker to assist in selecting which elements should be included in such a strategy. In the introduction of the second scenario, partic-ipants were asked to imagine that they were a policymaker working on a memorandum that advised the Dutch government with regard to fertilizers. It was stated that, for this memorandum, the policymaker wants to find a co-worker that can pro-vide the latest information about developments in this field.

Next, both scenarios described a fictitious source (in the form of statements manipulating the dimensions of accessibility and quality). These statements varied from one participant to the next. After reading the instructions, participants answered questions about the scenario using an online questionnaire. To control for order effects, the order of the statements about accessibility and quality was randomized across participants. 3.3. Measures and manipulations
The statements about the source in the scenario comprised the manipulation of the newly derived conceptualizations of accessibility and quality. Accessibility was manipulated by three statements about the source, relating to the physical, rela-tional and cognitive dimensions of accessibility. The physical dimension of accessibility was manipulated by stating that the co-worker was either full-time available or was working outside the organization for a part of the week. The relational dimension of accessibility was manipulated by stating that the policymaker either worried about disturbing the co-worker during his work or did not have any problems in disturbing the source. The cognitive dimension of accessibility was manip-ulated by stating that it was expected that the co-worker would either give complicated or clear explanations.
To assess the effect of the manipulation of accessibility, three statements were included in the questionnaire. The first statement affirmed that it was easy to make an appointment with this co-worker, measuring the physical dimension of accessibility. Second, it was stated that it was easy to process the explanation of this co-worker, measuring cognitive acces-sibility. The third statement measured relational accessibility by means of the statement that the respondent would feel uncomfortable approaching the co-worker. Subjects were asked to indicate their agreement with these statements on a 5-point scale.

The source quality dimensions were manipulated by two statements. Relevance was manipulated by stating that the co-worker was either working on subjects that match the subject of interest to the policymaker, or was working on subjects that did not really seem connected to this subject. Reliability was manipulated by stating that the co-worker had either been working in this subject area for years or had just started.

To check whether the manipulation of source quality worked and measure the two dimensions of quality, two statements were included in the questionnaire. First of all, it was stated that the co-worker X  X  knowledge matched the subject of the question well, measuring relevance. Second, reliability was measured by asking subjects to express their agreement with the statement that the co-worker knows a lot about the subject matter. Subjects were asked to indicate their agreement with these statements on a 5-point scale. The Appendix A provides sample scenarios and the items used as manipulation checks.
Finally, subjects were asked to indicate the likelihood of asking the described source for information, measuring the dependent variable. Responses were indicated on a 6-point scale ranging from very unlikely to very likely. 4. Results 4.1. Dimensions of quality and accessibility
Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using SmartPLS 2.0 ( Ringle, Wende, &amp; Will, 2005 ) was used to assess the reliability and dimensionality of the measures for accessibility and quality by computation of Composite Reliabilities (CRs) and Average
Variance Extracted (AVE) scores, shown in Table 2 . The items used in this analysis were the items used as manipulation checks. The statements measuring respondents X  perceptions of physical, cognitive and relational accessibility were related to the latent construct accessibility, and the statements measuring respondents X  perceptions of relevance and reliability were related to the latent construct quality.

Table 2 shows the composite scales, the items measuring these scales, the factor loadings of these items, as well as the CR and AVE values. To assess convergent validity of the measurements used, the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) for each of the theoretical constructs was examined ( Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981 ). The AVEs of both accessibility and quality were larger than the generally recognized 0.50, indicating that the majority of the variance in the original items is accounted for by the construct. In addition, within every scale, every item was checked to have statistically significant factor loadings larger than 0.50 ( Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 2006 ). In other words, convergent validity was met. Furthermore, the CR values are all above 0.80 (indicating sufficient reliability).

Discriminant validity was confirmed by comparing the within-construct item factor loadings to across-construct item loadings. Since all within-construct item loadings were high (all exceeding 0.70), and clearly higher than the cross-loadings, discriminant validity could be assumed. Finally, to assess discriminant validity, the square roots of the AVEs of each of the theoretical constructs were compared with the correlations among the theoretical constructs. For discriminant validity, a construct should share more variance with its measures than with other constructs in the model ( Chin, 1998 ), a criterion which was met by these scales: all AVE square roots exceeded the values of the correlations among the constructs in the corresponding rows and columns, see Table 3 . As such, discriminant validity was confirmed ( Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981 ).
The results of this analysis offer support for Hypotheses 1 and 2 , and thus for our conceptualization of accessibility and quality. The convergent and discriminant validity shown for both accessibility and quality by the CFA clearly indicates that accessibility consists of a physical, relational and cognitive dimension (supporting Hypothesis 1 ), and that quality consists of a relevance and reliability dimension (supporting Hypothesis 2 ).
 4.2. Manipulation checks
To check the manipulations of source accessibility and source quality, a one-way ANOVA was performed. The accessibility and quality manipulations affected participants X  perceptions as was intended. In the low accessibility condition, sources were seen as less accessible ( M = 2.69, SD = .69) than in the high accessibility ( M = 3.82, SD = .55) condition, F cantly differed, F (1,86) = 72.63; p &lt; .001. Further analyses focus on the between-subjects effects of accessibility and quality on source selection. 4.3. The influence of accessibility and quality on information source selection
Table 4 presents the average means and standard deviations for the study X  X  dependent variable in the various experimen-tal conditions.
 To test whether source accessibility and source quality affect the likelihood of asking a source for information, a two-way
ANOVA was conducted. It was hypothesized that the perceived accessibility and quality of a source affect the likelihood of asking a source for information. Table 5 presents the results of the tests of between-subjects effects.
 It is found that both between-subjects factors have a significant effect on the likelihood of asking a source for information.
Hypotheses 3 and 4 are thus supported. In addition, the effect size of these factors ( g 2 stronger effect on source selection than source accessibility. fects have a value between .0099 and .0588, medium effects between 0.0588 and .1379, and large effects have a g 2 .1379 and higher ( Richardson, 2011 ). This would qualify the effect of accessibility as a medium sized effect (as .13 is below the cutoff value of .1379  X  albeit barely), and the effect of quality clearly as a large effect. This finding provides support for Hypothesis 5 , although the difference between both effects is relatively small.
 5. Discussion 5.1. Main findings and contributions
Although much studied, the role of accessibility and quality in the selection of information sources has yet to be explained adequately. Significant amounts of empirical results have been accumulated, but efforts to theorize the underlying dimen-sions of both concepts have not kept pace. Consequently, there is little consistency and overlap in the measures of accessi-bility and quality that are used. Researchers have essentially been looking at and drawing conclusions from different construals.

Our paper contributes to the research in this area by identifying the dimensions underlying these concepts with regard to the selection of human information sources, based on social capital research. In doing so, the research suggests how the development of source selection theory may significantly profit from theoretical advancements in the field of social capital.
Although these two fields have been considered independently from each other for the most part, this research implies that future research on the selection of human information sources should try to link insights from both streams of research.
Social capital is a concept that has been found to be related to knowledge creation and knowledge sharing in a number of that insights from social capital theory have not been previously integrated into source selection research. Our main contri-bution to theory on source selection lies in the fact that it does establish this link, which proves to be a fruitful one, as it clarifies at least part of the conceptual confusion that has characterized previous source selection research. In this initial at-tempt at integrating insights from social capital theory in conceptualizing source accessibility and quality, underlying dimensions of accessibility and quality have been defined that can guide future source selection research. Especially in re-search concerning the selection of human information sources, our conceptualizations can be valuable. All dimensions, since they are based on social capital dimensions, are based on some aspect of the social relationships between people  X  in this case, between information seeker and information source. The ease with which a contact can be established (physical dimen-sion), the quality of that contact in terms of how comfortable the seeker feels in approaching the source (relational) and the cognitive resources that are shared in the contact between seeker and source (cognitive), are all part of the source X  X  per-ceived accessibility. In terms of quality, the extent to which seeker and source have a shared context determines relevance; existing relationships that enable the seeker to judge the source X  X  level of expertise determine reliability.

Our second contribution is that we use these conceptualizations of accessibility and quality to empirically investigate the influence of both considerations on human information source selection. Based on these conceptualizations, the study finds that both source accessibility and source quality are found to affect source selection. In addition, it was demonstrated that source quality has a slightly stronger effect on the likelihood of asking sources for information than source accessibility.
These findings have a high internal validity regarding human information source selection since they are based on concep-tualizations of accessibility and quality that are solidly founded in the literature. The fact that we used a scenario experiment enhances both the internal and external validity of this finding, as compared to previous qualitative studies (with very little control over variability due to unknown extraneous factors making it difficult to observe theoretical effects) or laboratory experiments (by providing scenarios selection decisions are made less in a social vacuum). Therefore, we feel that our con-clusions with regard to the influence of accessibility and quality on source selection have a solid basis. This claim is further corroborated by findings from previous source selection studies using open-ended research techniques (e.g., observation, interviews, think aloud protocols). These studies ( Fidel &amp; Green, 2004; Hertzum, 2002; Woudstra &amp; Van den Hooff, 2008 ) also assessed the role of accessibility and quality in an integrative manner, i.e. taking into account their different dimensions.
Together, these studies provide empirical support for the conclusion that (1) quality and accessibility both influence source selection, and (2) the influence of quality is stronger. However, it should be noted that these findings cannot automatically be generalized to the selection of digital or other non-relational information sources: more and more evidence is gathered (see e.g. Fidel &amp; Green, 2004; Hertzum, 2002 ) that the significance of source accessibility and quality in source selection differs between relational and non-relational information sources. Moreover, dimensions underlying these concepts might also dif-fer between relational and non-relational sources. Relevance is a well know dimension of source quality in literature on non-relational information sources, as is technical quality or reliability (see e.g., Hardy, 1982; Marton &amp; Choo, 2002; O X  X eilly, on one X  X  desktop), cognitive issues (e.g., the language used in the digital resource to convey the information  X  in terms of literacy and domain knowledge), and human X  X omputer relational issues (e.g., not feeling confident using a digital resource, not wanting to leave a digital trace of one X  X  request on a public electronic bulletin board, etc.), can also play a role in the selection of non-relational information sources. However, further research is necessary to substantiate this. 5.2. Practical implications and future research
Classic studies in source selection research found accessibility to be the dominant and only influence on information seek-ers X  source choice ( Gerstberger &amp; Allen, 1968; Rosenberg, 1967 ), a conclusion that is not supported by the findings of this study and many others ( Hertzum, 2002; Kremer, 1980; Marton &amp; Choo, 2002; Morrison &amp; Vancouver, 2000; Xu et al., but focused on more technical aspects of quality instead. This might have affected their findings: previous studies have iden-tified relevance as the main dimension of source quality ( Marton &amp; Choo, 2002; O X  X eilly, 1982; Swanson, 1987 ).
Based on these classic studies, however, is the popular belief that accessibility is the most dominant influence on infor-mation source selection and use. This belief no longer seems to be warranted. Our results suggest that managers may want to give at least equal priority to helping employees find relevant and reliable information instead of focusing exclusively on making information accessible. Once again, there is much to be learned from social capital research: measures aimed at developing the structural dimension of social capital (e.g., technical means that help to identify and locate others X  potential resources) are insufficient for achieving organizational advantages of knowledge management ( Huysman, 2004; Huysman &amp;
Wulf, 2004; Lesser &amp; Prusak, 2000 ). Although these investments help to physically access resources, they do not serve to motivate employees to share their knowledge or enable them to understand each other or value each other X  X  viewpoints ( Huysman &amp; Wulf, 2004 ). This requires investments in developing a corporate culture with high levels of trust and strong texts and language for collective action ( Dougherty, 1992 ). From a social capital perspective, this is related to building cog-nitive and relational social capital. Fostering these types of social capital is essential for helping employees see the relevance of others X  knowledge and their ability to trust others X  information, i.e., employees X  perceptions of a source X  X  quality.
The question that subsequently arises is what measures should be taken to enable this. In order to develop such mea-sures, it is necessary to know what specific issues concerning accessibility and quality need to be addressed. In order to have a clear pay-off for the organization, investments should address the most important barriers in the use of information sources. For such a task, it is essential to know precisely which dimensions of accessibility and quality are influencing source use and to what extent. Further research should thus assess the relative importance of the separate dimensions.
In addition, similar studies assessing the role of accessibility and quality in other contexts are needed to enrich our knowledge. Source selection is a complex phenomenon. Besides source accessibility and source quality, other factors play a role in the selection of information sources as well. Previous researchers for example assessed source selection in (a) var-ious types of organizations or professions (see e.g., Leckie et al. (1996) for an overview of studies on engineers, health care professionals, and lawyers; (b) for various types of tasks, taking into account such dimensions as task complexity ( Bystr X m,
Vancouver, 2000 ); and (d) under various circumstances, for example, when experiencing a lack of time ( Julien &amp; Michels, 2004 ). Not only do such factors have a direct effect on source selection (as the discussed studies established), it is also inter-esting to study them in conjunction with source accessibility and quality for a better understanding of both factors X  role in source selection. Under varying circumstances, the role of accessibility and quality may be altered, possibly resulting in accessibility being the dominant factor. 5.3. Limitations
Several limitations should be kept in mind when interpreting the results of this study. First of all, information seekers X  source choice was simulated describing fictitious tasks that may not have been familiar to all participants. Consequently, par-ticipants may have responded to the scenario in a different way than they would respond to a more true-to-life task. Yet, in a previous study including scenarios describing both familiar and unfamiliar hypothetical information seeking situations, no differences in the effect of accessibility and quality were found between these scenarios ( Vancouver &amp; Morrison, 1995 ).
Furthermore, as the situation was fictitious, participants did not actually have to contact the sources. As a result, certain considerations may have been less influential than in more true-to-life settings. On the other hand, the results of this study do corroborate results from studies in more true-to-life settings ( Fidel &amp; Green, 2004; Hertzum, 2002; Morrison &amp; Vancou-ver, 2000 ) (Footnote 1 ): quality is more important than accessibility. Further research should validate the findings using nat-urally occurring tasks.

Despite these limitations, we still feel that the approach used in this study, with a focus on a multidimensional view of accessibility and quality inspired by social capital research, has provided a valid contribution to research on information seeking and source selection in organizations. By proposing a theoretical framework, we hope to have contributed to over-coming the lack of consistency and overlap in definitions and measures of accessibility and quality. This, in turn, may help to solve the existing empirical confusion pertinent to the ongoing quality vs. accessibility debate. Finally, the results of this ini-tial study suggest that a social capital approach offers a valuable contribution to theory concerning human information source selection. Attention to the further theoretical and empirical development of the dimensionality of source accessibility and quality (and the separate roles these dimensions play in source selection) is, however, warranted.
 Appendix A A.1. Sample scenarios Imagine you work as a policy-maker in [NAME ORGANIZATION]. You are working on a memorandum that advises the Dutch government with regard to fertilizers. The memorandum will be used by the Dutch government in the development of their future standpoint on this subject. In the memorandum you therefore wish to incorporate important future develop-ments regarding fertilizers in the Netherlands. However, you lack state-of the-art knowledge concerning one of these future developments. You decide to go look for someone who can give you an answer in the company X  X  expertise directory on the Intranet.

You study one of the profiles. The profile indicates that this co-worker is working on subjects that match the particular development you want to know more of. The co-worker has been working in the field of this development for years. This person is working outside of the organization for part of the week. You expect this co-worker to give complicated explana-tions. You worry about disturbing this co-worker with your question.

Imagine you work as a policy-maker in [NAME ORGANIZATION]. You are part of a knowledge management project that has recently been formed within your department. In this group, a selection of co-workers is asked to come up with ideas on how to stimulate knowledge sharing within the department. In the first meeting, it was decided that a knowledge manage-ment strategy needs to be developed first. But how do you do this? And which elements should be included in such a strat-egy? To be able to continue the project, you decide to go look for someone who can give you an answer in the company X  X  expertise directory on the Intranet.

You study one of the profiles. This person is full-time available. You expect this co-worker to give clear explanations. You do not have any problems in disturbing this co-worker with your question. The profile indicates that this co-worker is work-ing on subjects that do not really seem to be connected to strategies concerning knowledge management. The co-worker has been working in knowledge management for only a short time.
