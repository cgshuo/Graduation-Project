 Businesses in the high-tech industry are faced with increasing competition. Given the high cost of raw materials, the key to survival in this industry lies in increased yield. As order to bring quality characteristics close to the desired target. Traditional statistical techniques such as analysis of variance and response surface methodology are However, if such techniques are to be applicable, their basic assumptions must be met. This paper proposes an artificial intelligence-based system in determining the process parameters. 
The particle swarm optimizer (PSO) was an evolutionary computation first proposed by [8]. Like bird flocking, fish schooling, and swarm theory, PSO was inspired by the social behavior of animals. In executing the PSO, every individual particle moves in accordance with a randomized velocity in the flying experience of itself and others in the same swarm. Unlike traditional genetic algorithms, PSO possesses memory, so the optimal solution for the swarm in execution will be memorized. process parameters, is deemed a very useful approach ([9], [10]). Trelea [11] analyzed how the selection of parameters in PSO affected convergence and the performance of finding the solution through dynamic system theory. 
The adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is basically a fuzzy neural network. First proposed by [12], ANFIS systematically generate fuzzy rules from the training data of input and output. This is a supervised neural network based on fuzzy theory, which has been in extensive us e in the prediction and control domain. Cai et al. [13] used ANFIS to predict the state-of-charge of high power in a rechargeable battery, whose performance was then compared with the back-propagation artificial BPN. Mar and Lin [14] used ANFIS to formulate rules in controlling the speed of cars to avoid collisions. ANFIS were used in other areas by [15], [16], [17], [18]. 
This paper, therefore, proposes a system for determining the process parameters by using ANFIS as the simulation model. A modified PSO is then used to determine the optimal process parameters. A perturbed strategy is also incorporated into the modified PPSO. The application of the method is then demonstrated and tested with the finding of process parameters for the second bonding process, which is an important step in the IC packaging industry. Figure 1 is the framework of the proposed method. 2.1 The Integrated System Figure 1 shows that the learning process of the proposed method is multiple ANFIS, its trained input being the controllable parameters of the process, and the output being the quality characteristics. Once the input/output is established by multiple ANFIS, PPSO algorithm is then used to find the optimal process parameters. 2.2 PPSO Algorithm The procedure for the algorithm is shown in figure 2. Since the quality characteristic of this example is the larger-the-better case, PPSO is basically a maximum problem. The PPSO algorithm, unlike traditional PSO algorithms, includes the perturbed strategy. Its implementation is as follows: Step 1 . (Initial solution): Randomly generate L initial solutions. Step 2 . (Update the velocity): The calculation of every particle in the PPSO algorithm is Step 3 . (Update position): The update of the solution for every particle is as follows: Step 4 . (Obtain quality characteristic): The qu ality characteristics are obtained through Step 5 . (Perturbed strategy): This is the key step in the modified PSO. When a random The algorithm is run on every function 100 times; the initial solution is generated with the uniform random number between [ X 5, 5]. The parameter of the algorithm is w = 0.7, the number of particles = 200, and the number of iterations = 7000. Moreover, c = 0.7 are used in equation (6). a:  X  is the number of optimal solutions obtained 
Table 1 shows that in all 100 runs, except for when N = 12, PPSO is able to find the PSO. Figure 3 shows the improvement of the average best solution for equations algorithm from caving into the local optimum . This section demonstrates the applicability of the proposed method through the optimization of parameters for the second bonding process. 4.1 The Wire Bonding Process the packaging industry. The goal is to connect the chip with the inner lead in the lead molten into a small ball, and then pressed onto the first bonding point. The gold wire is shown in figure 4. 
The data used in this paper is the actual process output [19]. The main controllable intensity of ultrasonic power. Its quality characteristic is wire pull. 4.2 The Learning Result of ANFIS characteristics are first pre-processed. This me ans normalizing the original data so as to learning being dominated by variables with a greater range, and also affect the entire characteristics and the parameters between [0, 1]. membership Training 
The parameters of ANFIS learning include: membership function and the number of memberships among the variables. In terms of membership function, triangle, trapezoid and bell-shape are chosen for testing. There are also three sets of numbers chosen as the number of membership among the variables. Table 2 shows that when the membership square error (RMSE) is the smallest. Therefore, this paper adopts this model. Figure 5 shows the response output for quality characteristic in ANFIS. 4.3 The Proposed Algorithm Implementation In the packaging industry, the larger the quality characteristic of the second bonding process, the better. This paper uses the PPSO algorithm to find the largest wire pull for the gold wire. bonding process. The result indicates that the PPSO algorithm is able to generate the near-optimal parameters for the manufacturing process under the ANFIS-trained model in all 30 runs. Manufacturing in the high-tech industry is a complex undertaking. Designing an efficient and easy decision-making system to determine the parameters for processing is, therefore, of paramount importance. Traditional statistical techniques may be determining the optimal parameters for the process based on artificial intelligence. then used to determine the optimal parameter for the process. This paper then tested the performance of the PPSO algorithm with testing functions, the result of which shows that the perturbed strategy used by PPSO is effective at avoiding caving into the local optimum. This paper further demonstrated the application of the proposed approach with the second bonding process in the IC packaging industry. As far as the optimal parameter in this example is concerned, figure 5 shows that a local optimum exists in the relationship model of controllable parameters and quality characteristics. The result of the testing also shows that this PPSO algorithm is able to find the global optimum under the ANFIS model.
