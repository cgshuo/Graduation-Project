Consumer profiling and feedback technologies are pervasive and ubiquitous in current infor-mation spaces, and are bound to grow in popularity and sophistication in future information environments. Advancements in information and communication technologies, such as the
Internet to sophisticated data mining and information retrieval techniques, and the perva-siveness of feedback forms and other electronic information collectors have made customer profiling a highly lucrative effort. Personal information is collected from individuals, ana-lyzed and mined, and then deployed, ideally and hopefully, for improved accuracy in targeting of products and services of interest to the individual. Playing devil X  X  advocate, one can also use these technologies to begin segmenting users in unintentional manners and for invading the privacy of individuals. While, the private sector continues to push the frontiers in how technologies are deployed for consumer profiling, academia lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical inquiries into these technologies.

Greg Elmer, in Profiling Machines: Mapping the Personal Information Economy , aims to fill this deficiency by offering a critical analysis of consumer profiling technologies. Drawing on the media and cultural studies literature, Elmer describes how profiling technologies are embedded in our daily life and how they influence the way we live. This book makes significant contributions to literatures in information retrieval, cultural and media studies, information systems, law, and even public policy by studying a contemporary and pervasive technology which can impact our lives, behaviors, and even societal policies.
 The book is comprised of seven chapters. Chapter 1, The Culture and Technologies of
Profiling, discusses the theoretical underpinnings of  X  X rofiling X . To situate his work, Elmer begins the book by conducting an exposition of the writings of Henri Lefebvre, Harold Innis, David Harvey, Armand Mattelart, Fritz Malchup, James Carey, Christopher Dandeker,
Michel Foucault, among others. Elmer needs to be commended for succinctly, and accurately, describing the works of eminent scholars in a lively manner.

Chapter 2 outlines a diagrammatic model of surveillance for outlining current profil-ing technologies. The chapter begins with a critique of Michel Foucault X  X  examination of
Jeremy-Bentham X  X  seventeenth-century design of a panoptic prison. Three strands of de-bates on surveillance are introduced here. The first is the discussion on technologies used for surveillance. The second is the enticement of individuals to share information for rewards or incentives. Finally, the synoptic view is discussed, which is reverse surveillance where the observed watch those doing the surveillance. Deductively arguing by exploring the var-ious works under these arguments, Elmer proposes his diagrammatic view of surveillance, in which, subjects are not simply profiled or surveyed, rather they are both rewarded for participating in the surveillance and punished if they choose to opt-out.

Chapter 3, Consumption in the Network Age: Solicitation, Automation, and Networking, begins by providing a historical look at how the nature of purchasing has been impacted by technological innovations. Elmer traces the roots of profiling to the data collection efforts by the U.S. Census Bureau. Following this, a discussion of Universal Product Code (UPC), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Point-of-Sale (POS) technologies is conducted.
Elmer X  X  describes how technologies can enable for more precise targeting and profiling via increased precisions in cross-referencing, mapping, and analysis of information. In addition, he explores how profiling of information is built into the production and consumption cycles for products and services.

Chapter 4 begins by discussing the various types of personal information that are of interest when applying profiling technologies and techniques discussed in Chapter 3. Elmer then, moves on to the concept of Geographical Information Systems (GISs) to analyze the issues of spatial information mapping. Adding the geographic dimension on demographic information makes for more targeted and effective profiling. GISs can help in the development of computer-generated maps of target consumer markets.
 Chapter 5, Deploying Profiles in Promotional Events, uses illustrative vignettes (Virgin
Air, Bass Ale, etc), and a case study of Molson Beer to explore the dynamics of customer profiling in advertising campaigns. A particular focus here is to explicate how personal information is solicited via various incentives. Elmer illustratively shows how profiling tech-nologies enable for customer segmentation and the implications of doing so.

Chapter 6 focuses on analyzing the World Wide Web as a panoptic medium. Elmer begins by discussing how the features of the Web make it an enticing medium for surveillance.
A discussion of surveillance features in browsers, search engines, spiders, and cookies is conducted. Elmer, rightly, notes that even if users are given options or are knowledgeable in how to opt-out from information collection schemes they are at a disadvantage. To truly disable all surveillance technologies is too expensive and in many cases is not possible.
Moreover, even if one was to do so (for example, by disabling cookies), the services one might receive when opting-out will be of limited and low quality.
 Chapter 7 concludes the book with a discussion of the politics of mapping technologies.
Elmer is concerned with how mapping technologies get incorporated into cultures and become habitual or second nature without serious scrutiny.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Elmer has presented his material in a lively manner by achieving the seemingly elusive goal of blending academic theories with real-life cases and vignettes. The book is well-organized and delivers on its intended goal  X  a study of the politics of profiling and mapping technologies. The book will be a good supplementary text for graduate students in information science, communication studies, and media and culture studies programs. Researchers in these fields will also gain from the book by uncovering promising research problems. While industry has led the efforts in the development of profiling technologies, there is a lack of sound theoretical and empirical studies to study this important phenomenon. I would argue that it is important for academia to lead and not follow industry in the study of these technologies. After all, we do not want industry to implement technologies that would later be discovered to be counter-productive or harmful. Academic research can uncover the many subtleties of these technologies and inform industry practices by proposing design guidelines.

In conclusion, Elmer has laid forth a sound foundation for the examination of profiling technologies and their implications for our society.
