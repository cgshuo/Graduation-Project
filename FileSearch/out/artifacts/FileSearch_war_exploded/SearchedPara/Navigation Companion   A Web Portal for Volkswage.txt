 In this paper, we describe th e VW Labs Navigation Companion website, an online portal Volkswagen customers can use to send destination addresses to their cars. The Navigation Companion website is part of a larger VW Labs site where we are developing a suite of tools that will allow people to customize and update different types of information a bout their Volkswagen vehicles online, and then transfer that information to their Volkswagen cars. More tools with different features will be coming in the future. H.5.2 [ Information Systems ]: Information interfaces and presentation  X  user interfaces. Design, Human Factors.

(www.vwlabs.com), a website whic h allows users to connect to their vehicles though an online porta l. The VW Labs website will consist of various tools that in teract between the home or office computer and the in-car navigation system in different ways. The first tool that was launched on the website is called Navigation Companion. This tool allows us ers to find destinations (such as points of interests or addre sses) online, and save these destinations to an SD memory card in a manner that is readable by the Volkswagen in-car navigation system. Once in the vehicle, the destinations on the SD memory card can be loaded into the navigation system. Users will see a list of the destinations that they have saved from the VW Labs website. They can simply select a destination X  X  file name to navigate to that location, without having to type in an address letter by letter or search for a point of interest while driving. One of the motivations for creating the Navigation Companion tool came from the desire to make the vehicle more connected in a customer X  X  life. Nowadays, users are accustomed to accessing information at their fingertips and expect this information whenever, wherever. By creating an Internet site for their car, we hope to begin to bridge this gap. We found that many people in their course of planning a trip complete a majority of the planning before they get into their cars, either on their home or work com puters. The result is usually a scribbled address on a Post-It note or a print out of Google Maps. Our tool offers them an easier way to do this trip planning. Additionally, by moving some driving-related tasks that are secondary to the primary task of driving outside of the vehicle, we hope to create a safer driving environment where users are less distracted by other tasks, such as searching for a destination or planning a trip in the car. Lastly, as we are fortunate to have some enthusiastic customers of the Volkswagen brand, we wanted to begin an online community focused on Volkswagen customers. This website is a first step in the direction of creating such a community. To use the Navigation Companion tool, customers first create a user account on our website, www.vwlabs.com. Once they complete the sign up process, they will have access to the Navigation Companion tool the next time they log on to the site. Additionally, users will need to install Flash Player and Adobe AIR on their computers, both of which are free downloads, at http://www.adobe.com/support/flas hplayer/downloads.html and http://get.adobe.com/air, respectively. After users have Flash Player and Adobe AIR on their computers, they can then install the Adobe AIR-based NavSync program which will allow their computers to communicate and save the destination files to the SD memory card. Once logged in to their VW Labs account and installation process is complete, users can use the Navigation Companion tool to create destinations that are readable by their Volkswagen navigation system. To do this, they simply enter either a point of interest, such as  X  X estaurants in San Francisco, CA X  or an address of their choosing, such as  X 1 Ma rket Street, San Francisco, CA, X  into the search box on the page. Using the Google Maps API, the website will return relevant des tination results. The user can review these destinations on the map on the website to verify its destination X  X  link to obtain more information about the destination. After the user has determined wh ich destinations they would like to keep, they simply drag and drop the destination listing to the category buckets ( X  X estaurants, X   X  X ightseeing, X   X  X nfrastructure, X  etc.) specified on the left hand side of the website. These categories correspond to the diffe rent categories of points of interest that exist on the Volkswagen touch screen (RNS 510) in-car navigation system. Once the destination is dragged in to a category bucket, the user can view all the destinations they have saved in that category bucket, for example, to see the de stinations saved in the category bucket  X  X estaurants, X  they simp ly click on  X  X estaurants X  on the left hand side menu. At this point, they can click on a checkbox to mark the destination for sync with the vehicle. They can also rate how much they like that particular destination or point of but it is also aggregated with the ratings of others using the website to calculate a Volkswagen community average score. This is so that users can get a sense of how other Volkswagen drivers in the community view that destination. We envision three main benefits of this website: Navigation Companion is the first tool on the VW Labs website. In the future we would like to expand upon the number of tools and features available to customers, all with the same theme of personalizing or transferring inform ation to their vehicles. We would like to build a community of Volkswagen drivers using this web portal and encourage community interaction. We are in the process of soliciting user feedback regarding this tool to inform future ideas and designs. Special thanks to Dr. Axel Heinrich and Margit Burkhard for their support of this project.
