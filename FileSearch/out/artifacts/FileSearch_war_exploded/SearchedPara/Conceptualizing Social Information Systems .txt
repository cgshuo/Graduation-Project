 In this paper, I propose a research agenda based on the concept of the social information system , a form of information system designed to process information a bout individuals and their social relationships for the explicit purpose of producing a particular social order, i.e, organizational culture. The agenda is based on a review of extant research on organizationally-bound social network(ing) sites, categorizing findings according to labor-oriented and social-oriented uses . The proposed research agenda establishes as an object of soci o-technical inquiry the design and use of the social information system as a facilitator of organizational culture.

In response to the radical changes in digital technology and the electronic communications infrastructure of the late twentieth century, information and its atte nding technologies have come to play an important role in the design of contemporary organizations. Organizations e xperimenting with new forms of information systems seek to maximize the productivity and innovation of a workforce that is more geographically diverse than generations prior, has the personal means  X  and often the desire  X  to move between jobs and careers at a faster pace, and for whom the post-industrial ec onomy and the production of information-and knowledge-b ased goods is the norm. Early research into the use of information technology in organizations emphasized tec hnology-mediated communication, individual and collaborative task performance, and changes in the computerization of the work e nvironment. The relationship between IT and the social order of the organization  X  i.e., organizational culture  X  is not a new focus of study; however, research has typically studied culture as a consequential byproduct of the application of technology to existing and emergent work practices. Following the turn in theory and practice of organizational studies towards organizational design and culture as objects of inquiry, [e.g., 2, 7] the application of information technology has extended beyond worker productivity and communication to the explicit construction of organizational culture through the strategic use of information technology [e.g., 4]. The implications of design of social information systems for the shaping of organizational culture is an under-theorized area, situated at the intersection of organizational design, social in formatics and computer-supported collaborative work. The proposed research poster will explore this intersection by establishing as an object of socio-technical inquiry the design and use of social information systems, a form of advanced information system currently typified by the social network(ing) site. Social information technology is a type of advanced information system (AIS) : a digital technology which  X  X rocesses information integral to the user X  X  communicati on or decision task X  and is used to  X  X ransmit, manipulate, analyze, or exploit information. X  [3] Social information technology differentiates itself from other forms of communicative and collaborative AIS in that it is designed to afford the transmissi on, manipulation, analysis, and exploitation of social informati on; i.e., to process information about individuals and their social relationships for the explicit purpose of producing a particular social order. The context produced by social information technology is differentiated from earlier communi cations technology (such as email and instant messaging software) in that it establishes virtuality :  X  X he capacity of communicative technologies to constitute rather than mediate realities and to constitute relatively bounded spheres of interaction. X  [5 , emphasis added.] The virtual spheres of interaction produced by social information technology enables social telepresence . The term borrows from Jonathan Steuer X  X  concept of telepresence ( X  X he experience of presence in an environment by means of a communication medium X ) and extends the concept beyond its original emphasis on individual, visual, synchronous mediated interactions [9]. Social telepresence thus consists of the experience of any information about a person that is encoded in an information system in order to relay that information to another individual constitutes social telepresence, whether the medium is visual, audio, or textual, synchronous or asynchronous, and regardless of whether the information is about their individual or relational characteristics, or a combination thereof. Task-oriented information systems are often referred to as social technologies to the degree that they connect individuals (subjects) in order to work together (or  X  X ocially X ) towards a given labor-oriented goal (object). That such a system may transmit information about coworkers as a result of co-labor only accidentally and temporarily alters the subject-object orientation. Conversely, social telepres ence is the phenomenological, experiential byproduct of the use of social information systems. The information produced and retr ieved in social information systems is other -oriented information in the sense that its production by the individual self (subject) is an instance of what Shutz refers to as social behavior:  X  X ntentional conscious experiences directed toward the other self. X  [8] The weight of this distinction is most clear by understanding technology as a flexible artifact, shaped by factors both subjective and objective. Even in cases where the intended use of an information system is relatively prescribed in the design of the system and the task towards which it is oriented, there is removing the key objective factor  X  the task, which is not to suggest that the definition of the task is entirely objective  X  only the subjective factors  X  that is, the self and the other self  X  remain to shape the rules and norms of the social information system. This is a new situation for in formation systems designers, and their (subjective) role in constructing objective design factors of social information technology ought to be revisited. The question, of course, is rh etorical. The proposed agenda presupposes a distinction between task-and social-oriented information and information system s. However, the diversity of use practices and the pace of innovation of social information technology make it hard to form a reliable model of social information technology use; more-so to speculate on the relationship of trends in public so cial technology use to emergent work practices that incorporate social information technology. Neither a recourse to the popularity of publicly-accessible social information technology (e.g., so cial network sites such as Facebook and MySpace) nor labor-oriented explanations such as  X  X he task-technology fit X  [1] will conceptually accommodate the other -orientation of social information systems. Simply stated: in their everyday social lives as well as in work settings, different people will use the same social technology differently, and some will not use it at all; the consequences of such diversity have unknown implications for the design of social information technology as well as for the design and experience of organizational culture. The proposed research poster will present a visualization of the current  X  X errain X  of organizationa l social information systems. The depth of the research is limite d by the exploratory nature of the inquiry, the meta-review level of analysis of research findings, and most importantly by the adolescent state of social technology in the workplace. The focus of the review will be identifying task-or labor-oriented and other-oriented use of social network(ing) systems which have been deployed by organizations such as IBM, Hewlett Packard, Accenture, Booz Allen Hamilton, SAP, and many others. 1.
