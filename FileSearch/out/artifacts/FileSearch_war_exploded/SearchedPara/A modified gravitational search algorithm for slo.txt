 1. Introduction
Slope stability is one of the fundamental problems in geotech-nical engineering and has been studied extensively for years. The stability assessment of earth slope may be addressed using both deterministic and probabilistic approaches. The deterministic analysis of slope stability basically involves the calculation of safety factor for trial slip surfaces and search for a slip surface yielding the lowest factor of safety. The factor of safety of a slope is defined as the ratio between the available strength and the strength required for a state of incipient failure along a possible slip surface. In terms of the limit equilibrium principle, a factor of safety less than one represents the failure in a slope.
Slope stability problems are characterized by many sources of uncertainties, and deterministic methods are unable to handle the uncertainties in the analysis. This situation indicates a need for a more objectively-structured and quantitative approach toward handling uncertainties involved in the calculations. The probabil-istic approach is a natural choice for this type of analysis, because it allows for the direct incorporation of uncertainties into the analytical model. In this approach, safety of a slope is measured by the reliability index or by the probability of failure, instead of by the classical factor of safety. The problem of searching the minimum factor of safety and minimum reliability index of earth slope is a complex optimization problem with the presence of several local minima points in the search space and an appro-priate optimization technique allows a mathematically reliable search for the problem. In recent years, extensive studies have been carried out to employ different optimization methods for the solution ( Bhattacharya et al., 2003 ; Cheng et al., 2007 , 2008 ; Greco, 1996 ; Khajehzadeh et al., 2010 ; Li et al., 2010 ; Sengupta and Upadhyay, 2009 ; Xue and Gavin, 2007 ). However, this study proposes an effective modified gravitational search algorithm for slope stability analysis.

Gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is a novel meta-heuristic stochastic optimization algorithm inspired by the law of gravity and mass interactions ( Rashedi et al., 2009 ). In GSA, the indivi-duals, called agents, are a collection of masses which interact with each other based on the Newtonian gravity and the laws of motion. The agents share information using the gravitational force to guide the search toward the best location in the search space. The high performance and the global search ability of GSA in solving various nonlinear functions infers from the results of experiments undertaken previously ( Rashedi et al., 2009 , 2011 ).
In GSA, all agents move to a new place, the direction and distance are determined by their velocities. By changing the velocities over time, the agents are likely to move toward the global optima. However, in the beginning of the search process, the agents are far away from the optimum point and hence a big velocity is needed to globally search the solution space (exploration). Conversely, when the best solution found by the population improves greatly after some iteration, only small movements are needed and velocity must be set to small values (exploitation). Based on this, we propose a modified gravitational search algorithm (MGSA) which aims to offer faster convergence while maintaining and improving quality of the solution. In the proposed MGSA, velocity-clipping technique is applied with time-varying maximum velocity, which decreases over the full range of search to facilitate the global exploration in early iterations and local exploitation at the final iterations. The numerical simulation results of five well-known benchmark functions and two slope stability problems demonstrate that the proposed strategy may significantly improve the GSA X  X  convergence performance.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of GSA. Section 3 explains our proposed modified gravitational search algorithm (MGSA). In Sections 4 and 5 , the deterministic and probabilistic slope stability analysis approaches are described. In Section 6 , the testing of the proposed
MGSA through benchmark problems is carried out and the simulation results are compared with those obtained via standard
GSA. The efficiency of the proposed MGSA for two slope stability analysis is investigated in Section 7 . Finally, Section 8 outlines our conclusions. 2. Gravitational search algorithm
Gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is a newly developed stochastic population based search algorithm based on the law of gravity and mass interactions ( Rashedi et al., 2009 ). In this approach, the search agents are a collection of masses which interact with each other based on the Newtonian gravity and the laws of motion. In GSA, the performance of the agents is measured by their masses. All the agents attract each other by the gravity force, while this force causes a global movement of all agents toward the agents with heavier masses ( Rashedi et al., 2009 ). The heavy masses correspond to good solutions of the problem. In other words, each mass represents a solution, and the algorithm is navigated by properly adjusting the gravitational and inertia masses. By lapse of time, the masses will be attracted by the heaviest mass which it represents an optimum solution in the search space.

To describe the GSA, consider a system with N agents (masses) in which the position of the agent i is represented by:
X  X  X  x 1 i , ... , x d i , ... , x n i  X  for i  X  1 , 2 , ... , N  X  1  X  where x i d is the position of agent i in dimension d and n is the search space dimension.

After evaluating the current population fitness, the mass of each agent is calculated as follows:
M  X  t  X  X  where: m  X  t  X  X  best( t ) and worst( t ) is the best and worst fitness of all agents, respectively and defined as follows: best  X  t  X  X  min worst  X  t  X  X  max
To evaluate the acceleration of an agent, total forces from a set of heavier masses applied on it should be considered based on a combination of the law of gravity according to:
F  X  t  X  X  where rand j is a random number in the interval [0, 1], G ( t ) is the gravitational constant at time t , M i and M j are masses of agents i and j , e is a small value and R i,j ( t ) is the Euclidean distance between two agents, i and j . kbest is the set of first K agents with the best fitness value and biggest mass, which is a function of time, initialized to K 0 at the beginning and decreased with time.
Here K 0 is set to N (total number of agents) and is decreased linearly to 1.

By the law of motion, the acceleration of the agent i at time t , and in direction d , a i d ( t ), is given as follows: a  X  t  X  X 
The searching strategy on this concept can be described by the following equations. v  X  t  X  1  X  X  rand i v d i  X  t  X  X  a d i  X  t  X  X  8  X  x  X  t  X  1  X  X  x d i  X  t  X  X  v d i  X  t  X  1  X  X  9  X  where rand i is a uniform random variable in the interval [0, 1].
This random number is applied to give a randomized character-istic to the search. x i d represents the position of agent i in dimension d , v i d is the velocity and a i d is the acceleration.
It must be pointed out that the gravitational constant G ( t )is important in determining the performance of GSA and is defined as a function of time t :
G  X  t  X  X  G 0 exp b t t where G 0 is the initial value, b is a constant, t is the current iterations, t max is the maximum iteration number. The parameters of maximum iteration t max , population size N , initial gravitational constant G 0 and constant b control the performance of GSA. 3. Modified gravitational search algorithm
At each update step of the standard gravitational search algorithm (SGSA), the algorithm proceeds by adjusting the dis-tance (velocity) that each agent moves in every dimension of the problem hyperspace. Eq. (8) shows that the velocity of any given agent is a stochastic variable and is, therefore, subject to creating an uncontrolled trajectory, allowing the agent follows wider cycles in the problem space. In order to control these oscillations and to avoid explosion and divergence, in this study a reasonable interval is introduced to clamp the agent X  X  velocity according to:
V where V max is a designated maximum velocity allowed. The maximum velocity defines the maximum change one agent can undergo in its positional coordinates during an iteration. Gener-ally, the value of V max is problem-dependent. If the value of this parameter is too large, then the agents may move erratically, going beyond a good solution; on the other hand, if is too small, then the agent X  X  movement is limited and the optimal solution may not be reached.

Similar to the other heuristics optimization algorithms, the success of the GSA depends to a large extent on the careful balance of two conflicting goals, exploration and exploitation. The exploration is the ability of expanding global investigation of the search space, where the exploitation is the ability of finding the optima around a good solution. In premier iterations, the algo-rithm must use the exploration to avoid trapping in a local optimum. As the searching process continues, exploration fades out and exploitation fades in to allow the found solution to be fined. In order to improve the search performance and controlling the balance between exploration and exploitation, this study proposes a time varying maximum velocity equation as follows:
V max  X  X  1  X  t = t max  X  h V max0  X  12  X  where exponent h is a positive constant which is chosen by trial and error and V max0 is the initial velocity limit and considered as a fraction a of the distance between the bounds of the search space for each variable according to:
V
Eq. (12) facilitates an initial global search with a relatively large value of V max during early iterations. The gradual reduction of V max over the iterations, decreases the amplitude of a gent X  X  oscillations and narrows down the algorithm exploration. It encourages the agents concentrate the search effort around the best solutions found so far and converge to the global optima in the latter part of the optimization.

According to the above descriptions, the whole workflow for updating the position and velocity of agents in the proposed
MGSA is presented as a flowchart in Fig. 1 . 4. Deterministic slope stability approach
The generally adopted approach to evaluating the factor of safety and deterministic analysis of slopes is the limit equilibrium method of slices. In this study, a concise algorithm of
Morgenstern and Price (1965) method is used for calculation of
The original formulation of the Morgenstern and Price ( M  X  P ) method is very complicated and the nonlinear equations should be solved using numerical methods. Zhu et al. (2005) developed the method and obtained two explicit expressions for the factor of safety ( FS ) and the scaling factor ( l ). In this method, like in the original M X  X  method, the inclination of the resultant inter-slice force varies symmetrically across the slide mass. Thus, the relationship between the normal and shear inter-slice force may be expressed as: T  X  f  X  x  X  : l : E  X  14  X  where T is the shear inter-slice force, E is the normal inter-slice force, l is a scaling factor to be evaluated in solving for the safety factor, and f ( x ) is the assumed inter-slice force function with respect to x . Several functions (e.g., constant, trapezoidal, sine, and half-sine) may be used for f ( x ).

In order to evaluate the factor of safety ( FS ), one should consider the forces acting on a typical vertical slice of a natural slope with general-shaped slip surface as shown in Fig. 2 . force at the base of slice i ; U i  X  pore water pressure at the base of slice i ; S i  X  mobilized shear strength at the base of slice i ( S f  X  effective angle of internal friction at the base of slice i ; l  X  length at the base of slice i ; Q i  X  external surcharge of slice i ;  X  inclination of slice base; b i  X  width of slice i ; h i height of slice i ; K h  X  horizontal seismic coefficient; h of center of the slice; b i  X  inclination of slice top; d surcharge load.

By resolving the force equilibrium in directions parallel and perpendicular to the base of the slice, the following equation is obtained ( Zhu et al., 2005 ): FS  X  in which T  X  W i sin a i  X  k h W i cos a i Q i sin  X  d i a i  X  X  16  X  R  X  X  W i cos a i K h W i sin a i  X  Q i cos  X  d i a i  X  U i tan f c  X   X  sin
The result of the moment equilibrium about the middle of the slice X  X  base in the form of an explicit expression for the scaling factor l may be expressed as: l  X  in which E 0  X  0 and E  X   X  X  sin
To solve for the factor of safety, one should first specify the form of the inter-slice function f ( x ) and assume the initial value for FS and l . The appropriate choice for initial values of FS and l are 1 and 0, respectively ( Zhu et al., 2005 ). Then, FS will be evaluated using Eq. (15). After that, the value of l is calculated based on Eq. (19). Finally, the factor of safety is recalculated with these computed values of scaling factor. The iterative procedure is completed when the difference between computed values of FS and l is within an acceptable tolerance.
 t=t+ 1 5. Probabilistic slope stability approach
Generally, the factor of safety obtained by the deterministic method is not a consistent measure of safety because various uncertainties are not considered. Therefore, the probabilistic approach has been introduced as an alternative tool for analyzing the safety of earth slope in which various soil parameter uncer-tainties can be considered rationally. In probabilistic approach, safety of a slope is measured by the reliability index ( b ) or by the safety state of a slope may be expressed by the so-called performance function G ( X ), where X  X  [ X 1 , X 2 , X 3 the vector of basic random variables of a slope. The performance function (limit state function) partitions the vector space X into two separate regions: the safety region indicated by G ( X ) 4 0, and the failure region indicated by G ( X ) o 0 , while the limit state surface is presented by G ( X )  X  0. In general, the performance function is a function of the factor of safety ( FS ) of a slope which is defined as: G  X  X  X  X  FS  X  X  X  2 1  X  21  X 
Based on the limit state function of the system, the probability of failure of the slope, P f , can be evaluated from the following integral equation:
P  X  P  X  G  X  X r 0  X  X  where f X ( X ) represents the joint probability density function of the vector of random variables, and the integral is carried out over the failure domain.

The reliability index ( b ) is developed to evaluate the compara-tive reliability of a system when the exact probability distribution function is not known. An invariant approach to calculate the reliability index was proposed by Hasofer and Lind (1974) which known as the advanced first order second moment (AFOSM) method. In this approach, the random variables ( x i ) are trans-formed into a normalized and uncorrelated set of reduced vari-ables, Z , using the mean value ( m i ) and standard deviation ( s according to: z  X  x where z i is a normalized variable with zero mean and unit standard deviation. The Hasofer and Lind (HL) reliability index ( b ) is defined as the minimum distance from the origin of the normalized basic variables to the limit state function in the normalized coordinate system, G ( Z ). The matrix formulation of the Hasofer X  X ind reliability index ( b HL ) is defined in the following form ( Ditlevsen, 1981 ; Low and Tang, 1997 ): b  X  min where F is the failure domain and R is the correlation matrix. contains the correlations among a set of n random variables.
Although the correlation coefficient among two random variables has a range 1 o r ij o 1, one is not totally free in assigning any values within this range for the correlation matrix. It must be emphasized that the correlation matrix has to be positive definite ( Low and Tang, 2004 ). The problem of searching the minimum reliability index ( b min ) can be formulated as an optimization problem as follows: Minimize b HL Subjectto G  X  Z  X  X  0  X  25  X  where G ( Z ) is the limit state function in the normalized coordi-nate system. The solution of the above optimization problem is the reliability index and most probable failure point. 6. Model verification
In order to demonstrate, compare and analyze the effective-ness and performance of our proposed modified gravitational search algorithm (MGSA), it would be appropriate to test the algorithm on five representative standard benchmark functions.
These functions have been extensively used to evaluate the performance of optimization algorithms. The functions, dimen-sion, the admissible range of the variable and the optimum are summarized in Table 1 . All the functions are to be minimized. The first three functions are unimodal functions whereas the next two functions are multimodal optimization problems with a consider-able amount of local minima.

The functions presented in Table 1 are solved using both SGSA and MGSA. In all cases for both algorithms the population size is set to 50 ( N  X  50), G 0 and b are considered equal to 100 and 20, respectively. For MGSA, h and a are set to 0.05 and 0.1, respec-tively. These parameters, which are usually problem dependent, are selected based on the authors X  experience and the general recommendations given in the literature ( Rashedi et al., 2009 , 2011 ). However, a detailed discussion of the effect of the expo-nent h to the performance of the MGSA is presented in the next subsection. To represent the effectiveness of the proposed mod-ification, all cases are solved with varying maximum iteration numbers ( t max ) equal to 500 and 1000.

The algorithms are simulated 30 times and the results are recorded. From the recorded simulated results, statistical analyses are carried out and the results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 for maximum iterations equal to 500 and 1000, respectively. For each method, the worst, mean, median, best and standard devia-tion are calculated from the 30 simulated runs and then compared.
 Very encouraging results can be obtained from Tables 2 and 3 .
In terms of mean fitness values, the results indicate that for the functions F 1 , F 2 and F 4 the mean fitness evaluated by MGSA in 500 iterations are much lower than those computed by SGSA in 1000 iterations. For the functions F 3 and F 5 also MGSA provide better solution compared with SGSA in the same number of iterations. In addition, the standard deviations of the results by MGSA in 30 independent runs are also smaller than those computed by SGSA, which indicate the more stability of the proposed algorithm. From the above results, it can be concluded that MGSA greatly outper-forms SGSA with even better mean, median, best and standard deviation. Figs. 3 X 7 demonstrate the convergence rate compar-ison among the proposed MGSA and SGSA on the five benchmark functions with t max  X  500. In these figures, the representative variations of the mean best fitness in the form of logarithm values over the number of iterations are depicted.

From Figs. 3 X 7 , it can be seen that the varying curves of fitness values using MGSA descend much faster than those using SGSA, and the fitness values descent to lower level using MGSA. More-over, as shown in Fig. 7 for minimization of F 5 the resulting history converges very quickly by SGSA, within the first 50 iterations, but does not improve after the initial convergence indicating that the algorithm falls into a local trap and is not able to escape from it. In other words, after becoming converged, the algorithm loses its ability to explore and then becomes inactive. It is apparent from the testing results of five functions that MGSA significantly surpasses SGSA on all the selected test functions. 6.1. MGSA with different values of exponent h
In this section, the effect of the parameter h to the perfor-mance of the MGSA is studied. This parameter controls the reducing speed of the searching scale. To investigate the influence of h on the performance of MGSA in detail, a set of experiments have been carried out using different values of h . Two benchmark functions from Table 1 were selected to show the test results; one unimodal and one multimodal. The parameters of the algorithm, such as population size, maximum iteration, etc. are the same as before. Figs. 8 and 9 show the mean best fitness values attained by the MGSA versus the different values of h for functions F and F 4 , respectively. The results are averaged over 30 independent run for each discrete h value.

From these figures, it is easy to see that the mean best fitness value varies with respect to the parameter h . As shown in
Figs. 8 and 9 , when h is too small, the average searching quality is poor because the solution space may not be covered suffi-ciently. As h gently increases, the ability of the algorithm for exploration and exploitation increases and the best results are obtained at h  X  0.05. After that by increasing the value of h , the performance of the algorithm decreases and the best fitness obtained at the end of evolution is far away from the global optimum. For the other benchmark functions, similar results could be obtained. Therefore, considering the searching quality of the MGSA, it is recommended to choose h between 0.03 and 0.07. 7. Model application
In the previous section, the efficiency and robustness of the proposed strategy (MGSA), as a global optimization method, have been verified by considering a number of benchmark problems. In this section, the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method to search for the minimum factor of safety as well as the minimum reliability index of earth slope will be investigated by considering two cases of slope stability problems from the literature. The first case is a homogenous slope and the second case is a stratified slope. The factor of safety is calculated based on the concise algorithm of M X  X  method and the reliability index is calculated based on AFOSM. The implementation of the MGSA for slope stability analysis has been carried out using a computer program developed in MATLAB R2009a. The program is capable of searching for the minimum factor of safety and reliability index and the most critical deterministic and probabilistic slip surfaces of earth slope. In the following cases, the maximum iteration number ( t max ) is set to 500 and other parameters considered are specified in the previous section. 7.1. Application to a homogeneous slope
The first case is a homogeneous slope with height of 10 m and the slope inclination of 18.4 1 , which was studied earlier by Chowdhury and Xu (1992) . The cross section and the geometry of the slope are presented in Fig. 10 .

In this case, the effective friction angle ( f 0 ), effective cohesion ( c 0 ), unit weight ( g ) and pore water pressure ratio ( r considered as random variables. The first and second statistical moments (i.e., mean and standard deviation) of the random variables are presented in Table 4 . In this example, all the random variables are assumed to be normally distributed. Based on correlation between random variables, three cases are considered for analysis as follows: Case 1. Uncorrelated random variables with r u  X  0, Case 2. Correlated random variable with r c j  X  0.3, r c g jg  X  0.7, Case 3. Correlated random variable with r c j  X  0.5, r c g jg  X  0.7.

Chowdhury and Xu (1992) solved the problem and evaluated the minimum factor of safety based on simplified Bishop X  X  method ( Bishop, 1955 ) and the Hasofer and Lind reliability index.
In this case, the minimum factor of safety and its associated critical deterministic slip surface is computed based on the mean values of the soil properties. This problem is solved using the proposed algorithm and the evaluated minimum safety factors and minimum reliability indexes are shown in Table 5 . Moreover, to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, the results of SGSA are also presented. In Table 5 , FS min and b the minimum factor of safety and the minimum HL reliability index associated with the critical deterministic and probabilistic slip surfaces, respectively. From the results of this table, it can be observed that the minimum factor of safeties obtained by MGSA for all three cases are lower than those reported by Chowdhury and Xu (1992) and slightly lower than those achieved by SGSA. In addition, the minimum reliability indexes calculated by the presented MGSA method are lower than the values reported by
Chowdhury and Xu (1992) and also SGSA. From the reliability analysis point of view, results of Table 2 clearly show that the reliability index is sensitive to the correlation coefficient between random variables in which b min decreases as the value of r increases.

The critical deterministic and probabilistic failure surfaces found by both algorithms (SGSA and MGSA) are presented and compared in Figs. 11 X 13 . As it can be seen, the critical determi-nistic and probabilistic failure surfaces are located reasonably close to each other as expected in a homogeneous slope ( Bhattacharya et al., 2003 ). However, the slip surfaces determined using SGSA are slightly different with those obtained by MGSA. 7.2. Application to a stratified slope
This example considers a stratified slope in clay bounded by a hard layer below and parallel to the ground surface with a cross section as shown in Fig. 14 . The soil strength parameters that are related to the stability of slope, including effective friction angle f 0 , and effective cohesion c X  , are considered as random variables.
The random variables are assumed to be uncorrelated and have a lognormal distribution. The statistical moments (mean value and standard deviation) of the parameters are summarized in Table 4 . The unit weight of the slope is assumed to be 18 kN/m 3 . This example was studied earlier by Hassan and Wolff (1999) , Bhattacharya et al. (2003) and Khajehzadeh et al. (2010) . Hassan and
Wolff ( Hassan and Wolff, 1999 ) proposed a search algorithm to calculate the minimum factor of safety and reliability index. They formulated the factor of safety using the Spencer method ( Spencer, 1967 ) and evaluated the reliability index based on mean-value first-order second-moment (MFOSM) method assuming a lognormal distribution for the factor of safety. Bhattacharya et al. (2003) employed direct search method combined with Spencer method ( Spencer, 1967 ) and MFOSM for the solution. Khajehzadeh et al. (2010) proposed a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) combined with Spencer method ( Spencer, 1967 )andAFOSMforthe solution and compared the results w ith the standard particle swarm optimization. The results obtained from the current study, together with a comparison of those reported by previous researchers, are summarized in Table 6 . The results show that the minimum factor of safety calculated by the proposed MGSA is 1.6453 and is lower than those evaluated by the other methods. Besides, the minimum reliability index determined using MGSA is 2.767, which is the lowest among the other solutions. The results of Table 6 also show that, the difference in performance betw een the proposed MGSA and MPSO is marginal and both algorithms could provide a good solution for this problem. However, the maximum num ber of iterations required by
MPSO is 3000 ( Khajehzadeh et al., 2010 ), which is greater than that required by MGSA (500) and the computational effort involved in implementing the new algorithm is less than MPSO.

Fig. 14 depicts the corresponding critical deterministic and probabilistic slip surfaces derived from SGSA and MGSA. As shown in this figure, the critical surfaces are located significantly separate for a stratified slope when the upper layer is weaker than the lower one. The slip surfaces reported by Hassan and Wolff (1999) , Bhattacharya et al. (2003) and Khajehzadeh et al. (2010) are in reasonable agreement with those determined by the presented method. 8. Conclusions
In this paper, we have developed a modified gravitational search algorithm through introducing an adaptive maximum velocity constraint to the original algorithm. In GSA, the velocity update equation is a stochastic variable and is subject to creating an uncontrolled trajectory, allowing the agent follows wider cycles in the problem space. Therefore, dynamically changing maximum velocity may be served as a constraint to control the oscillations and to avoid explosion and divergence of the algo-rithm. The proposed modification is easy to implement, without additional computational complexity. Compared with standard GSA on five well-known unimodal/multimodal benchmark func-tions, our modified algorithm has been testified to possess excellent performance in terms of accuracy, convergence rate, stability and robustness. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MGSA to solve the real world optimization problems, we employ the new method for slope stability analysis as a complex numerical optimization problem. Comparison of the results of the presented method, standard GSA, and selected other methods employed in previous studies demonstrate the superior successful functioning of the MGSA by evaluating a lower values of factor of safety and reliability index.
