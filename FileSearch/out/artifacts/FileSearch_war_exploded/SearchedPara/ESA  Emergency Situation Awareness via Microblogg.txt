 During a disastrous event, such as an earthquake or river flooding, information on what happened, who was affected and how, where help is needed, and how to aid people who were affected, is crucial. While communication is important in such times of crisis, damage to infrastructure such as tele-phone lines makes it difficult for authorities and victims to communicate. Microblogging has played a critical role as an important communication platform during crises when other media has failed. We demonstrate our ESA (Emer-gency Situation Awareness) system that mines microblogs in real-time to extract and visualise useful information about incidents and their impact on the community in order to equip the right authorities and the general public with situ-ational awareness.

Microbloggers can potentially increase social awareness and even save lives. We develop an automated system to extract important information from microblogging media such as Twitter in regards to crises witnessed by its users. During disasters  X  X ither natural, such as flood, earthquake, tsunami, or bushfire, or man-made, such as street riots, fire in residential buildings, or explosions X  information from people local to the incident can help authorities to act fast during critical situations. This translates to saving lives, and rapid awareness of and recovery from damage. For ex-ample, people may request help, or report the collapse of buildings or bridges in their neighbourhood. In our system, called ESA (Emergency Situation Awareness), we leverage natural language processing and data mining techniques to analyse real-time data from Twitter to enhance emergency situation awareness during crises. Two main problems ex-ist: first, finding tweets that reveal the most representative information among millions of tweets generated each day, and second forwarding the right information to the right authorities or relevant individuals. In particular, we have collaborated with the Australian Crisis Coordination Centre (CCC) to assist watch officers in providing early warnings of unexpected incidents and exploring the impact of identified incidents across a wide range of disasters and crises [2].
Recently, the use of microblogs during crises has been in-vestigated in different aspects, including analysis of Twitter data for past events to show that there is potential to de-tect an emergency situation, and therefore increase situation awareness during emergency situations [7, 8]. There is also a large amount of literature proposing methods to extract useful information from microblog data generated each day. For example, Toretter [6] is a system developed for detecting earthquakes for certain geographical locations and notifying its registered users. This system is focused on identifying the occurrence of an earthquake but does not provide any other information about the consequences of the disaster.
The system most similar to ours is Twitcident [1]. It presents a Web-based application for searching and aggre-gating information about an identified crisis reported by emergency broadcasting services in the Netherlands. The main difference between ESA and Twitcident is that Twitci-dent relies on emergency services to notify the occurrence of an incident, whereas ESA continuously monitors the social media and identifies incidents automatically by analysing textual changes in streams of tweets from specific regions. People local to the incident can provide real-time notifica-tions about what they have experienced or witnessed when a crisis strikes. When an unexpected incident is detected, ESA can rapidly gather relevant information and provide an in-cident report to emergency authorities in a timely manner. For example, on June 19, 2012 at 8:54pm an earthquake struck Melbourne, Australia. ESA, successfully alerted for this incident at 8:55pm only a minute after its occurrence, while officials, such as Incident Alert Australia, did not re-port the incident until 10 to 15 minutes later.
The overall architecture of the ESA system and samples of its visualisation options are shown in Figure 1. The ESA system uses the Twitter API 1 to capture tweets for regions of interest within Australia and New Zealand. These tweets are then processed using a range of components, and results are displayed via a suite of visualisation interfaces for incident exploration. Below we describe key components of the ESA system and their implementation details. https://dev.twitter.com/ entities.
 Burst Detection: Our burst detection component contin-uously monitors tweets captured from Twitter and raises an alert when an unexpected burst is detected. To achieve real-time efficiency, a time-based probabilistic method [3] is adopted to identify bursty words from a chronologically ordered stream of tweets. It uses his-torical data to build a language model of word occur-rences. We refer to bursty words as alerts . An alert is identified if a term has a probability distribution that significantly deviates from the language model. The top part of Figure 1(a) shows our visualisation of the identified alerts during severe Cyclone Yasi in Queensland, Australia in February 2011, where the colour and size of each alert indicates the strength of the alert. Moving along the timeline, the magnitude of the alerts changes or they are added or removed. Tweet Clustering: When watch officers decide to inves-tigate an identified alert, our clustering component provides a rapid way to drill down into the topics that are discussed for the targeted incident. We inte-grated the Carrot2 clustering engine 2 with the open-http://project.carrot2.org/ Tweet Filtering: Not all the tweets about an incident con-frastructure, and requests for help from people in the area. Classification is performed by building Support Vector Machines classifiers using a variety of features extracted from tweets.
 In Figure 1(b) (Impact assessment), our infrastructure impact classifier identifies tweets that report damage to roads, bridges, airports, power supplies, and telecom-munication infrastructure during the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. This enables watch officers to rapidly gauge the impact of an identified incident on the community. It also potentially helps in navigating health service providers, or other responders through routes that are not damaged.
 Geo-Tagging: To enable spatial exploration of tweets, ESA has a geo-tagging component that displays the con-tent of a tweet at its geographic location on a map. If a tweet is already geo-tagged by its author, its lat-itude/longitude coordinates are used directly. Other-wise, we use the location field of the user profile to determine a latitude/longitude position. The location string is passed to the Yahoo geo-coding service 3 and the top five matches in the world are retrieved. Then, the most suitable match is selected using state or coun-try constraints to geo-tag the tweet. Given the impor-tance of location, especially in tweets requesting help without explicit mention of where it is needed, we plan to expand this module by estimating the location of a tweet as proposed by Li et. al. [4] based on tweet content and its publication time.
 Incident Augmentation: Oftenitisveryusefultobeable to get an overview of a specific incident. We developed a visualisation option that uses additional resources, such as maps of an affected area, images, and videos posted for an event to create an overview of an identi-fied incident.
 The incident augmentation module in ESA gathers ad-ditional information about a given incident all in one place. For example, related images and videos that are linked to in the tweets. To collect details about an incident, we also used the Stanford Named Entity Recogniser (NER) 4 to extract named entities such as names of people, organisations, locations, times, and dates that are mentioned in tweets. Afterwards, lo-cations and organisations are marked on the map to show where an incident was actually taking place, us-ing the geo-tagging technique explained above. Fig-ure 1(c) (Incident report) shows our visualisation of a fire incident at the Diamant Hotel in Canberra, Aus-tralia, with tweets augmented with the location of the incident, related images, videos, and tweet texts with highlighted entities.

For the evaluation of the ESA system, please refer to [9].
The functionality of ESA is implemented as a Web-based system, which demonstrates two main components: Alert Monitoring and Impact Assessment . Alert Monitoring con-tinuously monitors a stream of incoming tweets and raises http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/placefinder/ http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml an alert when an unexpected burst is detected. By default, it starts from the current time and date to identify alerts, and it can also be set to replay a historical incident by show-ing stored alerts. For example, the Indonesian earthquake in April 2012 can be replayed by setting the date and time as 11/04/2012 and as 18:54; for the Melbourne earthquake, Australia, in June 2012, the date and time can be set as 19/06/2012 and as 20:55. Given the nature of the monitor-ing task, at each point of time there may or may not be alerts to display.

Impact Assessment in response to a user query retrieves and visualises relevant tweets and cluster summaries with respect to an incident and its impact. For example, a query can be specified to retrieve tweets that report infrastruc-ture damage during earthquakes. The ESA system can be demonstrated to visualise analytical results for a list of his-torical events, such as natural disasters and crises, that hap-pened in Australia and New-Zealand since March 2010.
