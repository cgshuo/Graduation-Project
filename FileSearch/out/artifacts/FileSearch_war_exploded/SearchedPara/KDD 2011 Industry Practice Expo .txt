 The Industry Practice Expo is a brand new track at the KDD 2011 conference. It feature s invited talks from leading experts who have developed and deployed successful, large -scale data mining applications and systems in their respective fields. We trust that this opportunity for the KDD community to hear directly from the experts will start a new era of cross -fertilization of ideas in knowledge discovery and data mining from various disciplines. The field of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining has matured tremendously over the past 15 years. This advancement in the field is duly reflected in the KDD conference publications describing the leading edge researc h and industry/government applications. At the planning meeting for KDD 2011, Usama Fayyad, the SIGKDD chairman, proposed starting a new track that would complement the already well -established Research and Industry/Government tracks at the KDD conference and showcase the successes and best -practices of applications and systems of knowledge discovery and data mining in various industries. While the Research and Industry/Government tracks would continue their excellent work featuring the latest advances in t he field via peer -reviewed publications, the Industry Practice Expo track would feature invited talks from leading experts who would otherwise not publish in the KDD Research or Industry/Government tracks either because of time -constraints or because they are from industries where their work is publicized in forums other than the KDD conference. Armed with this mandate we started on an almost year long journey to conceive, implement, and present to you the inaugural KDD Industry Practice Expo. We have kept our ambitions very high right from the beginning and have aspired to bring together a group of leading -experts to deliver a series of technical talks focusing on innovative and leading -edge, large -scale applications and systems of data mining in areas such as finance, health -care, bio-informatics, public policy, infrastructure (transportation, utilities, etc.), telecommunications, social media, and computational advertising. We wanted to select the talks that will inspire and motivate fellow members of our KDD community by spreading awareness of various seminal, innovative, and proven applications of knowledge discovery and data mining, sharing key insights and best -practices, and introducing new problems, challenges, and methodologies. We have been immense ly fortunate to have the opportunity of working with an advisory committee for the Industry Practice Expo. The committee comprises of individuals who are luminaries in their own right and have generously devoted their time and energies in guiding us throug h the process. We are extremely grateful for their advice, constant support and encouragement. We have selected a great panel of speakers who represent a broad cross -section of KDD applications and systems across multiple industries. In putting together t his Industry Practice Expo track we have taken the time and effort to get to know each potential speaker well, carefully reviewed their work to better understand
