 Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of large-scale knowledge graphs, such as Freebase, YAGO, Google X  X  Knowl-edge Graph, and Microsoft X  X  Satori. Whereas there is a large body of research on mining homogeneous graphs, this new generation of information networks are highly hetero-geneous, with thousands of entity and relation types and billions of instances of vertices and edges. In this tutorial, we will present the state of the art in constructing, mining, and growing knowledge graphs. The purpose of the tuto-rial is to equip newcomers to this exciting field with an un-derstanding of the basic concepts, tools and methodologies, available datasets, and open research challenges. A publicly available knowledge base (Freebase) will be used throughout the tutorial to exemplify the different techniques. Over the recent years, multiple large-scale knowledge bases have come to existence, from purely academic projects such as YAGO to major commercial projects such as Facebook X  X  Open Graph, Google X  X  Knowledge Graph, and Microsoft X  X  Satori. These knowledge bases are an enabling resource for a plethora of new knowledge-rich applications. The tuto-rial is designed to provide an overview of such applications and use-cases, as well as equip newcomers to this area with solid understanding of the basic techniques, research chal-lenges, and pointers to relevant literature. This tutorial will bridge together three top-level areas of the KDD 2014 Call for Papers, namely, algorithms, applications, and big data. The tutorial will be self-contained, and is designed to be ac-cessible to researchers and practitioners in related disciplines who want to learn more about mining large-scale knowledge graphs. An undergraduate degree in CS or statistics should be sufficient to understand most of the content in the tuto-rial.

Evgeniy serves as a PC chair for WSDM 2015, and has served as an area chair or senior program commit-tee member at numerous major conferences, including SI-GIR, KDD, WWW, WSDM, AAAI, IJCAI, ACL, EMNLP, CIKM, ICDM and ICWSM. He has organized a number of workshops and taught multiple tutorials at SIGIR, ACL, WWW, WSDM, ICML, IJCAI, AAAI, CIKM, and EC. Ev-geniy earned his PhD in computer science from the Technion -Israel Institute of Technology.

 Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of large-scale knowledge graphs, from purely academic projects such as YAGO to major commercial projects such as Google X  X  Knowl-edge Graph and Microsoft X  X  Satori. Whereas there is a large body of research on mining homogeneous graphs, this new generation of information networks are highly heteroge-neous, with thousands of entity and relation types and bil-lions of instances of those types (graph vertices and edges). In this tutorial, we present the state of the art in con-structing, mining, and growing knowledge graphs. The pur-pose of the tutorial is to equip newcomers to this exciting field with an understanding of the basic concepts, tools and methodologies, open research challenges, as well as point-ers to available datasets and relevant literature. Knowledge graphs have become an enabling resource for a plethora of new knowledge-rich applications. Consequently, the tutorial will also discuss the role of knowledge bases in empowering a range of web applications, from web search to social net-works to digital assistants. A publicly available knowledge base (Freebase) will be used throughout the tutorial to ex-emplify the different techniques.
This half-day tutorial will be composed of two parts. We will first present the main concepts of knowledge bases, as well as the main available datasets. Using the open-domain knowledge base Freebase (now moved to Wikidata) as our running example, we will describe the principles underly-ing the construction and the applications of large knowledge bases. In particular, we will describe how to automatically grow knowledge bases by extracting facts and events from text, and the research challenges of entity resolution, rela-tion extraction and link prediction. We will also discuss the practical impact of knowledge bases on major Web applica-tions such as search, question answering or digital assistants.
The second part will focus on the state-of-the-art and the open research challenges in growing and mining knowledge bases. The automatic extraction of facts from text with thousands of possible relations and millions of entities must be carried on with little to no explicit supervision, while prediction or infering clusters in the knowledge graph, poses the challenge of dealing with heterogeneous data and a large number of relationships. In this part of the tutorial, we will present the state-of-the-art in algorithms for link prediction and clustering in knowledge bases and relational data, with an emphasis on mdethods based on probabilistic models and representation learning. We will also discuss weakly learning algorithms for relation extraction from text.
We believe the tutorial will appeal to two groups of SIGIR participants. The first group includes industry attendees working in related areas who want to acquire more scientific background and be apprised of the recent research results in the field. The second group includes established researchers as well as PhD students who are interested to work in this exciting area and who will benefit from the introduction to the main concepts, overview of main research challenges, and pointers to existing resources and datasets.
