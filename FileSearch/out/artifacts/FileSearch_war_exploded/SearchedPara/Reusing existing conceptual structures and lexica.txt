 In this article we present a preliminary study of the existin g ontologies and lexica which could be reused in order to characterize neologisms in the realm of the neurosciences.
 manage terminology in an efficient way it is essential to reuse existing resources and tools, rather than starting from scratch with every new project (McCrae et al 2012). Until quite recently, this effort was an almost impossible one, due to the lack of interoperability of resources , which are generally inaccessible for a number of diffe r-ent reaso ns such as the incompatibility of fo r-mats or the inaccessibility of data, among others. and the Linked Data paradigm opens up a new panorama in which data can (and should) be linked and shared across projects and ap plic a-tions. In this paper we focus on the possibilities of applying the principles of Linked Data to the characterization of new concepts within the Ne u-roNEO project and describe existing resources and technologies that might be suitable for our purposes. First, we present the main objectives of the Ne u-roNEO project and the role played by conceptual organization (section 2). Then we describe the ontological and lexical resources in the neurosc i-ences that could be reused for the purposes of the NeuroNEO project (section 3). In section 4 we focus on the principles of Linked Data and their possible application to terminology projects. In section 5 we review the lemon model proposed by McCrae et al . (2012) for interchanging lexical resources over the semantic web. Finally, we point out the main challenges and pitfalls that lay ahead in the NeuroNEO project. The NeuroNEO Project (Garc X a Palacios et al, in press) aims to observe, compile and analyze newly -created Spanish terms in the co nstantly -evolving realm of the n eurosciences, with a sp e-cial focus on the very moment and context in which neologisms are born. to collect new lexical units in clo se collaboration with specialists in the field and with specialized translators as necessary collaborators and dec i-sive agents in the dissemination of neologisms. For further details on the process of neology detection and handling within NeuroNEO refer to Garc X a Palacios et al. (in press).
 need to observe the place they occupy within the conceptual structure of the discipline. With a view to corroborating whether new terms are semantically motivated, the concept ual structure from the specialists X  point of view needs to be considered, that is, we should observe how ne u-roscientists organize knowledge about their field. motivated and can therefore be easily related to othe r already existing close concepts in the fiel d, the chances for these new terms to be accepted by experts will be higher. Over the past years, several joint efforts have been made to collaborate in the exchange of o n-tolog ies in the biomedical sciences. One of them is the BioPortal of the National Center for Bi o-medical Ontology (NCB O 1 ) , which provides access to commonly used biomedical ontologies and to tools for working with them. Within the portal two ontologies dedicated to the neurosc i-ences are available: the Computational Neurosc i-ence Ontology 2 and the NIFSTD ontology, described in more detail later. Both can be dow n-loaded in OWL and therefore reused with appl i-cations such as ontology editors. tologies in the biomedical domain is that of the OBO Foundry 3 , which aims at making a core of ontolo gies fully interoperable by virtue of a common design philosophy and implementation. terest shown by life scientists in sharing ontol o-gies and conceptual structures across the web. EHTOP, European Health Terminol o-gy/Ontology Portal (Grosjean et al, 2011). The EHTOP is a repository that provides access to 32 health terminologies and ontologies, both for humans and computers. It focuses on French and English, although some data are available in other languages, too. multiple resources of the medical sciences, i n-cluding the neurosciences. However, as far as we know, it is not prepared to link data using RDF or the Linked Data principles and Spanish is not one of the supported langua ges. 3.1 Neuroscience Information Framework One of the most outstanding efforts to develop domain ontologies in the field of the neurosc i-ences is being carried out within the Neurosc i-ence Information Framework (NIF 4 ). NIF is a dynamic inven tory of w eb -based neuroscience resources that gives access to data, materials, and tools via the Internet , bringing together the e f-forts of 16 centers for neuroscience research. In order to overcome the need for a shared s e-mantic framework for neuroscience, NIF has developed NeuroLex 5 , a lexicon of common neuroscience terminology built from NIFSTD in a modular fashion, with separate modules cove r-ing major domains of neuroscience (e.g., anat o-my, cell types, techniques) . NIF Standard ontology (NIFSTD) is constructed according to the set of best practices established by the OBO Foundry project. In this way it was designed to avoid duplication of effort and ensure that work performed under one domain is of maximum utility to the broader communit y by conforming to standards that p romote reuse (Bug et al . , 2008). All data are open access and codified in RDF and the entire ontology can be downloaded in OWL. This feature makes it especially useful for our purposes, as we could download parts of the o ntology and include our newly discovered concepts within the already existing NIFSTD structure.
 The main drawback for our purposes is that both Neurolex and NIFSTD are codified in English and we want to describe Spanish neologisms. The need for  X  X ocalization X  of the ontology has to be assessed before using the NIFSTD ontol o-gy in a Spanish context (Espinoza et al , 2009). The term Linked Data refers to a set of best pra c-tices for publishing and connecting structured dat a on the Web . It also refers to data published on the Web in such a way that it is machine -readable, its meaning is explicitly defined, it is linked to other external data sets, and can in turn be linked to from external data sets (Bizer, Heath &amp; Berners -L ee , 2008). ferred to as Web of Data, is described as  X  a web of things in the world, described by data on the Web  X  ( Bizer, Heath &amp; Berners -Lee , 2008 ). publishing data on the Web as Linked Data, known as Linked Data principles: data in RDF (Resource Description Framework) format. RDF provides a generic, graph -based data model with which to structure and link data that describe things in the w orld. In RDF, data are represented as a Subject -Object -Predicate structure, where the objects and subjects are e i-ther resources or literals (van Erp , 2012). Several RDF extensions are being designed with the goal to formalize knowledge bases like terminolo gy databases and lexical -semantic resources. As Chiarcos et al . (2012) point out,  X  X f (linguistic) resources are published in accordance with these rules, it is possible to follow links between exis t-ing resources to find other, related data and e x-ploit net work effects X .
 this are interoperability of language resources (both at the structure and the conceptual level) and information integration , that is, how to combine heterogeneous information from diffe r-ent sources in an efficient way (Chiarcos et al ., 2012). In our quest for a model that enables ontologies to be reused and to overcome th e language barr i-er, we are considering the lemon model (McCrae et a l ., 2012 a ) for interchanging lexica over the Semantic Web.
 RDF model that allows lexica to be specified for ontologies and allows these lexica to be pu b-lished on the Web (McCrae et al ., 2012b). The main features o f the model are: URIs are used to name and dereference linguistic annotations, and links can be easily created b e-tween lexicons using RDF tr iples.
 several lexica in different languages can be ass o-ciated to one and the same ontology. be of use in our building of a Spanish lexicon upon NIFSTD ontology. In this paper we have looked at different poss i-bilities to reuse existing resources in the chara c-terization of neologisms. suitable scenario for reusing resources widely accepted by neuroscientists. NIF STD ontology is readily available in OWL format, making it sui t-able for the exchange with applications such as ontology editors. use of resources originally created for the En g-lish language for characterizing neologisms in Spanish. In the NeuroNEO project we are going to intervene when the neologism has just been created or has not been created yet. In a certain sense, the Spanish -speaking neuroscientist is working in a bilingual situation (English -Spanish). On e consequence of this special kind of bilingualism is that there will probably be a single conceptual structure both for English and Spanish. This is why we believe that conceptual and linguistic resources created for the English language could be reused f or the purposes of organizing Spanish neologisms in this field.
 to be addressed. We have seen that models such as lemon could be used to share ontology lexica across the web in different languages. the trade -off between effort and quality of the result. The main issues that still lay ahead are the following: will be able to bene fit from previous efforts and contribute to the scientific community with our findings.
