 1. Introduction existing and new radio access technologies (RATs) to provide variety of optional access services for multi-mode terminals.
The success of NGWN will consist of a combination of terminal heterogeneity and network heterogeneity. In these heterogeneous wireless networks, mobile users will be able to communicate through any of the available RATs and roam from one radio access network (RAN) to another by using multimode terminals ( Wu et al., 2002 ). Multiple RANs with different RAT areas are deploy in the same geographical. Consequently, the coexistence of different RANs necessitates joint radio resource management (JRRM) to enhance QoS provisioning and efficient radio resource utilization. Joint call admission control (JCAC) scheme is an effec-tive way of the radio resource management.
 wireless networks. In ( Shengdong and Meng, 2008 ) an optimized call admission control scheme with rate degradation threshold for wide-band traffic (WB) when new narrow-band (NB) connection arrives in wireless networks, was proposed extensive numeric results show that the threshold variable can help to acquire the best grade of service.

JCAC schemes with load-balancing are proposed for heteroge-neous cellular networks. Load-balancing among multiple RANs in heterogeneous wireless network allows for a better utilization of radio resources. However, these JCAC schemes with load-balancing do not consider users X  preferences in making RAN selection decisions.
 selection decisions have been proposed in ( Vidales et al., 2005 ; Avaid et al., 2008 ; Falowo and Anthony, 2010 ; Huang et al., 2010 ).
For users X  selfish action, most of them may prefer to be connected through a particular RAN with the best performance. Conse-quently, some RANs may be highly overloaded whereas some others are under-utilized. Highly unbalanced traffic load will result in high overall call blocking/dropping probability and poor radio resource utilization. Thus, these JCAC schemes with con-sidering users X  preferences can lead to highly unbalanced network load in heterogeneous wireless networks.
 traffic load among available RANs in heterogeneous wireless networks and users X  preferences in making RAN selection decisions meanwhile. In ( Agusti et al., 2004 ), a fuzzy neural-based JCAC scheme is proposed for heterogeneous cellular networks. A JCAC scheme based on analytic hierarchy process has been proposed in ( Qingyang and Jamalipour, 2004 ). Pricing in commu-nication networks has received a great deal of attention in the literature ( Ozianyi and Ventura, 2006 ). To achieve the traffic load and considering users X  preferences at the same time in a hetero-geneous wireless network, static pricing mechanisms for wireless networks are used in ( Agusti et al., 2004 ; Qingyang and Jamalipour, 2004 ). However, static pricing is the simplest pricing policy, in which prices are fixed and are independent of the state of the system. Therefore, the effect is not so good.

Dynamic pricing is the most powerful and flexible mechanism ( Chen et al., 2006 ). In homogeneous wireless networks, dynamic pricing has been used to achieve an optimal bandwidth allocation, maximize revenue, obtain an incentive-compatible class alloca-tion, and achieve efficient power control. In this paper, we apply dynamic pricing to balance effectively traffic load among the available RANs in heterogeneous wireless.

In recent years, nature-inspired intelligent algorithms have been widely applied to solve communication engineering problems ( Roy et al., 2011 ; Ghosh et al., 2011 ; Islam et al., 2011 ). An adaptive differential evolution algorithm was proposed for autonomous deployment and localization of sensor nodes in ( Roy et al., 2011 ). An adaptive differential evolution algorithm for peak-to-average power ratio reduction in OFDM Systems in ( Ghosh et al., 2011 ). A modified discrete differential evolution based TDMA scheduling scheme was proposed for many to one communications in wireless sensor networks in ( Islam et al., 2011 ). Immune algo-rithm (IA) which is inspired by biological immune system, was a popular and effective tool for combinational optimization problems. In our initial work, immune algorithm was used to solve the optimization problems of communication engineering ( Chai and Liu, 2010 ; Zhu et al., 2011 ). A novel immune clone selection algorithm was proposed to solve the spectrum allocation problem of cognitive wireless network in ( Chai and Liu, 2010 ). To reduce the cost of TD-SCDMA network construction, a solution of base station location planning problem based on immune computing was proposed in ( Zhu et al., 2011 ). In this paper, we propose a novel immune optimization algorithm to solve JCAC problem.
 The contributions of this paper are threefold.

First, in next generation wireless networks, different access networks are integrated together to support user seamless com-munications and proactive access network selection. Therefore, joint call admission control (JCAC) schemes are required to select the most appropriate radio access network (RAN) for incoming calls. Joint call admission control problem has several objectives to be optimized at the same time. The simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives is different from single objective optimiza-tion in that there is no unique solution to multiobjective optimi-zation problems (MOPs),but instead, we aim at finding all of the good trade-off solutions which must be considered equivalent in the absence of information concerning the relevance of each objective relative to the others. We proposed multiobjective optimization model of JCAC, regarding balance load and users X  preferences as two optimizing targets. The proposed IA-JCAC scheme can make up for the defect of the existing schemes. Second, artificial immune system algorithms (Referred to as IA) have been recognized to be well suited to multiobjective optimization since early in their development because they deal simultaneously with a set of possible solutions. We develop a novel immune multi-objective optimization algorithm to solve JCAC problem. The proposed immune multi-objective optimiza-tion algorithm makes use of antibody cloning operator, genetic recombination operator, population classification operator and population update operator. For the constrained optimization problem, antibody population in the evolutionary process will produce some infeasible solutions, and in these infeasible solu-tions, there are some close to the edge of the feasible solution. This paper called them beneficial solutions. Beneficial solutions is very helpful for immune algorithm to search for the optimal solution, therefore, in our immune algorithm, the beneficial solu-tion is put composition memory populations and participating in the cloning operation of antibody population, so as to improve the algorithm convergence performance. The empirical study with respect to the number of objectives shows that the proposed novel immune multi-objective optimization algorithm scales well along the number of objectives.

Third, we use dynamic pricing to balance traffic load as much as possible, among available RANs in a heterogeneous wireless network. This approach reduces overall call blocking/dropping probability and improves overall system utilization.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 ,we describe the system model and assumptions. The proposed JCAC scheme based on immune optimization algorithm (IA-JCAC) is presented in Section 3 .In Section 4 , we investigate the perfor-mance of the proposed IA-JCAC scheme through simulations. Our conclusion is given in the last section. 2. System model and assumptions
A heterogeneous wireless network consists of J number of radio access networks (RAN), such as GSM, GPRS, UMTS, EV-DO, etc. RANs can have the same and fully overlapped coverage. In heterogeneous network, joint radio resource management (JRRM) allows for better utilization of radio resources ( Olabisi and Chan, 2010 ). We consider JRRM is using in the heterogeneous network. Each cell in RAN j ( j  X  1,2, y , J ) in the heterogeneous network has a total of B j basic bandwidth units (bbus). The physical meaning of a unit of radio resources (such as time slots, code sequence, etc.) is dependent on the specific technological implementation of the radio interface.

In order to maintain a lower handoff dropping probability, we reserve B hcall j basic bandwidth units (bbus) exclusively for handoff all new calls in RAN-j is B ncall j .
 B
We use the assumptions that been widely application in the environment where the number of mobile users is larger than the number of channels ( Falowo, 2010 ). The heterogeneous network supports I classes of calls. Each class is characterized by band-width requirements, arrival distribution, and channel holding ing the general assumption in cellular networks, each class-i ( i  X  1,2, y , I ) new calls and handoff calls arrive in the fully overlapped coverage area according to the Poisson process with (CHT) is assumed to follow an exponential distribution with mean 1/ s i ( Bo and Chen, 2004 ). To characterize mobility, the cell residence time (CRT), which is the amount of time during which a mobile terminal stays in a cell during a single visit, is assumed to follow an exponential distribution with mean 1/ t i . We assume that the CRT is independent of the service class. The channel holding time for class-i calls is exponentially distributed with There is N selection criteria used for describing a particular RAN. The weight of the RAN-j X  s selection criteria-n ( n  X  1,2, defined as c j , n . The weight represents the relative importance of each selection criteria (data rate, service price etc.) of the RAN to each user. The weight assigned to each criterion is on standard scale, such as on a 10 point scale (0 X 10), where 0 represents minimum weight and 9 represents the maximum weight.
 j ( j  X  1,2, y , J ). These alternative RANs are to be evaluated for each arriving call with respect to a set of N criteria (or attributes), which are independent of each other. A decision matrix, C for J alternative RANs and N criteria, is given as
C  X  where c j , n represents the performance rating of RAN-j ( j  X  1,2, on criterion-n ( n  X  1,2, y N ).
 particular RAN for each class of calls. This preference information is specified in terms of weight attached to each network criterion by the user. The weighing vector W u i represents the relative importance of the criteria to user-u of class-i call, and it is given obtained as: RAN-j , a i , j denotes the fraction of the residual bbu available in RAN-j over the summation of the residual bbu available in all
RANs, r i , j denotes the price per unit bbu per unit time in RAN-j , l ncall i , j denotes the measured call admission rate in RAN-j, and denotes the calculated ideal admission rate in RAN-j . For handoff class-i calls, the corresponding values are y i , j , b i , j .

Then
Similarly, arrival RANs for new and handoff class-i calls in RAN-j are obtained as follows: ~ ~ admission rate and the measured mean admission rate into RAN -j is obtained as follows: where that they can lead to highly unbalanced traffic load among available RANs in heterogeneous wireless networks because users act independently. Highly unbalanced traffic load will in turn lead to high overall call blocking/dropping probability and poor radio resource utilization in heterogeneous wireless networks. of attention in the literature. To avoid network congestion, pricing has been used as a mechanism that gives users incentives to behave in ways that improve the overall utilization and perfor-mance of the network. In this paper, to balance traffic load among the available RANs in heterogeneous wireless, we using dynamic pricing mechanism, that is to say, current load in each RAN determines the new service price in the RAN. New service price in each RAN affects users X  preferences for the RANs. Affected users X  preferences change the traffic-load distribution (of newly arriving calls) among available RANs.

RAN-j , after period T time, the new price serving for class-i calls in the RAN-j becomes r new i , j , the new price is calculated from the old price as follows: (13) as follows: where Z is a positive scalar step size. If l i , j ~ l i , j That is to say, D r i , j is positive or negative deciding by neous wireless network allows for a better utilization of radio resources. Good JCAC algorithm should distribute traffic load among multiple RANs evenly. In this paper, maximizing load-balancing is one optimization goal. For RAN-j , r j denotes the traffic load of RAN-j , then load-balancing rate is defined as following. f 1  X  experience. New call blocking probability and handoff call dropping probability are important indicators to measure users X  satisfaction. In this paper, we collectively referred to new call blocking probability and handoff call dropping probability as call blocking probability, minimizing call blocking probability is the another optimization goal. It is assumed that there are S calls (new call or handoff call) arriving at RANs in a period T , and there are s i class-i calls. In this paper, y u i , j denotes the preference threshold RAN-j for an incoming class-i call from user-u , e u denotes the relationship between the call-s of user-u to the

We describe the model as following. Formula (15) means maximizing average load-balancing rate and formula (16) means minimizing average call blocking probability in heterogeneous wireless. Constraint (17) means that the load of RAN-j must be smaller than its total number of basic bandwidth units. Constraint (18) means that each call-s is accessed to RAN-j or not. Constraint (19) means that each call-s is only connected to a radio access network. 3. Proposed IA-based JCAC scheme 3.1. Proposed immune multiobjective optimization algorithm for solving JCAC problem
Many real-word problems have several objectives to be optimized at the same time. The simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives is different from single objective optimization in that thereisnouniquesolutiontomultiobjectiveoptimizationproblems (MOPs), instead of, we aim at finding all of the good trade-off solutions which must be considered equivalent in the absence of information concerning the relevanc e of each objective relative to the others. Artificial immune system algorithms (Referred to as IA) have been recognized to be well suited to multiobjective optimization because they deal simultaneously wi thasetofpossiblesolutions.So, we design a novel immune multiobjec tive optimization algorithm to solve the JCAC problem in heterogeneous wireless network. 3.1.1. Antibody encoding
In immune algorithm, the problem is regarded as the antigen, and the possible candidate solutions for the problem are regarded as antibodies. According to the above narrative, each call of multi-mode terminals can only access to a network, that is to say, the calls accessing to which network is combinatorial optimization problem. Thus the antibody of immune algorithm using binary coding is appropriate.

In this paper each antibody corresponding an access control scheme, antibody matrix ( Ab ) encoding is applied, as following Eq. (21).
 Ab  X  where S denotes the total number of calls, J denotes the total number of RANs. Antibody matrix ( Ab ) can also be expressed as following: Ab  X  X  a 1 , a 2 , ... , a s , ... , a S  X  T or Ab  X  X  a js thus 3.1.2. Antibody cloning operation
For the constrained optimization problem, antibody population in the evolutionary process will produce some infeasible solutions, and in these infeasible solutions, some of them are close to the edge of the feasible solution. This paper called them beneficial solutions. Beneficial solutions is very helpful for immune algorithm to search for the optimal solution, therefore, in this paper, the beneficial solution is put composition memory population and participating in the cloning operation of antibody population, so as to improve the algorithm convergence performance.

Assuming the t generation antibody population for D ( t ), its population scale for N D ; memory population for G ( t ), its popula-tion scale for N G ; Creating new population E ( t ) by cloning operation, its population scale for N E . Memory clone operating is defined as O C .

[f Ab 1 N D  X  N G  X  t  X  , Ab 2 N D  X  N G  X  t  X  , ... Ab where , q k denotes the number of copies of antibody Ab k is decided by crowding-Distance of antibody Ab k . In our multi-objective algorithm, the dominant antibodies in population are ranked according to how much they contribute to the diversity of objective function values. This can be measured by the crowding-distance ( Gong et al., 2008 ). 3.1.3. Genetic recombination operation
Monoclonal variation is adopted in this paper, Assuming recombination E ( t ) to create population F ( t ). Genetic recombina-tion operation is defined as O R .
 O  X  E  X  t  X  X  X f O R  X  Ab 1  X  t  X  X  , O R  X  Ab 2  X  t  X  X  , ... , O where, for a matrix encoding antibody Ab k , its recombination means random selection of two columns a d , a s of matrix Ab exchange, recombination can also be expressed as following: Ab 3.1.4. Population classification operation According to the constraint condition, antibodies population F ( t ) is classificated as follows:
Step 1 : if the Ab 0 k in population F ( t ) does not meet the con-straints, then X  X  t  X   X  X  X  t  X [f Ab 0 k g , else ~ X  X  t  X  X ( t ) denotes feasible solution set, and ~ X  X  t  X  denotes infeasible solution set.

Where, P ( t ) denotes Pareto  X  dominant set, and ~ X  X  t  X  denotes non-dominant set. ~ ficial solution set, and ~ B  X  t  X  denotes useless solution set. 3.1.5.

Performance of proposed JCAC scheme
In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in this paper, the contrast experiment with the AHP-based scheme in ( Qingyang and Jamalipour, 2004 ) and our proposed scheme were done in the same experiment environment.

Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a method for finding the best solution to a complex problem by synthesizing all the problem-defining details. AHP has already been applied in a number of areas, such as predicting outcomes and allocating resources. In ( Qingyang and Jamalipour, 2004 ), the authors develop a network selection scheme for an integrated cellular/ wireless LAN system to guarantee the best QoS through selecting the most suitable network while preventing frequent handoffs. The design goal is to provide the user the best available QoS at any time. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to decide the relative weights of evaluative criteria set according to user preferences and service applications and the gray relational analysis(GRA) was used to rank the network alternatives, in ( Qingyang and Jamalipour, 2004 ). AHP takes advantage of hier-archy and pair wise comparison, and GRA focuses on finding the difference between the comparative and ideal options. However, user-centric JCAC algorithms in ( Qingyang and Jamalipour, 2004 ) can lead to highly unbalanced traffic load among the available RANs because users act independently, and most of them may prefer to be connected through a particular RAN. Highly unba-lanced traffic load will result in high overall call blocking/drop-ping probability and poor radio result utilization.
 Different from the existing scheme in ( Qingyang and Jamalipour, 2004 ), our proposed scheme employ dynamic pricing for balancing traffic load among available RANs in heterogeneous wireless networks where users X  preferences are considered in making RAT selection decisions.

In this section, the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using five performance metrics namely: (1) new class-1 call (voice call) blocking probability, (2) new class-2 call (data call) blocking probability, (3) class-1 handoff call (voice call) dropping probability, (4) class-2 handoff call (data call) dropping probability, (5) percentage load of each RAN. These performance metrics are explained as follows: New class-i call (voice call of data call) blocking probability: The probability that a new class-i call will be blocked in the heterogeneous wireless network.

Handoff class-i call dropping probability: The probability that a handoff class-i call (voice call of data call) will be dropped in the heterogeneous wireless network.

Percentage load of each RAN: The ratio of current load versus the affordable maximum load of each RAN.
 In this paper, the performance of the proposed IA-based JCAC scheme is evaluated with respect to AHP-based JCAC scheme using two-class call (voice call and data call) and three-RAN (WCDMA, TD-SCDMA,CDMA2000) in heterogeneous wireless net-work. The AHP-based JCAC scheme does not incorporate dynamic service pricing. All simulations are carried out using MATLAB. The following system parameters are used: B 1  X  B 2  X  B 3 (1 bu  X  16 kbps ), b 1  X  1 bu , b 2  X  2 bu , l ncall 1  X  l l 2 , l
We set the initial service price in each RAN to 1 Yuan per bandwidth unit (bu) per minute. Note that the pricing unit (i.e. unit price per bu per minute) used in this paper is intended for services. The prices are periodically updated in the proposed IA-based JCAC scheme and are almost constant in AHP-based JCAC scheme. For each incoming call, weights are randomly assigned to the RAN selection criteria. Four RAN selection criteria (data rate, service price, security level, and battery power con-sumption) are considered as shown in Table 1 .

Some criteria (e.g. security level) in Table 1 are specified using linguistic values such as very high, high, medium, low, very low. The linguistic terms are first converted to fuzzy numbers using a conversion scale. Then the resulting fuzzy numbers are converted to crisp numbers. A fuzzy scoring method is then used to convert each fuzzy number to a corresponding crisp value. In this paper, the five fuzzy numbers (very low, low, medium, high, and very high) are converted to 0.091, 0.283, 0.5, 0.717, 0.909, respectively ( Chen et al., 1992 ). So, the normalized decision matrix C  X  ( c is obtained as following.
 C  X 
This preference information is specified in terms of weight attached to each network criterion by the user. The weighing vector W u i represents the relative importance of the criteria to user-u of class-i call. In this paper, assuming users with the same to as W i . Users attach high weights (great importance) to service price. Weights assigned to service price by users are randomly chosen from 6 to 9 whereas weights assigned to other criteria are randomly chosen from 0 to 9.

Fig. 1 shows the performance of the proposed IA-JCAC scheme and AHP-JCAC scheme with respect to new voice call blocking DP stands for new voice call blocking probability without dynamic pricing, IA-JCAC with DP stands for new voice call blocking probability with dynamic pricing.

As shown in Fig. 1 , it can be seen that the new voice call blocking probability of proposed IA-JCAC scheme is lower than AHP-JCAC. The reason is that proposed IA-JCAC scheme with dynamic pricing is able to adjust the service price in each RAN with time so as to even out the unbalanced traffic among the available RAN. As a result, the proposed IA-JCAC scheme reduces the new voice call blocking probability in the heterogeneous wireless network.

Fig. 6 shows the variation in service price with time for the proposed IA-JCAC scheme with dynamic pricing using the linear price-update functions. As shown in Fig. 3 , it can be observed that whereas the service prices in RAN-1 and RAN-2 are almost constant with time, the price-update unit continues to increase the service price in RAN-3 in order to achieve load-balancing. 5. Conclusion
In this paper, dynamic pricing has been proposed to even out the highly unbalanced traffic load caused by independent users X  preferences in heterogeneous wireless networks where a user-centric JCAC scheme based on immune optimization algorithm is employed. By dynamically adjusting the service price in each of the available RANs, the JCAC scheme improves the distribution of traffic load among available RANs in heterogeneous wireless networks. The proposed JCAC scheme uses immune multi-objective optimiza-tion to select the most suitable RAN for incoming calls (new call and handoff call), thereby enhancing user satisfaction. The performance of the proposed JCAC scheme has been illustrated using a three-RAN heterogeneous wireless network. Simulation results show that the proposed IA-based JCAC scheme with dynamic pricing achieves lower call blocking/dropping probability than the AHP-JCAC scheme which does not incorporate dynamic pricing. Results also show that theproposedschemeimprovestrafficloaddistributionamong available RANs in heterogeneous wireless networks, and has the advantage of good application value.
