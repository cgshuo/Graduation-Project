 Pate nt machine translation (MT) is one of the major application fields of MT [1].H owever, sentences in Chinese patent texts are known for their complicated stru c-tures with multiple verbs and preposition s. I t is necessary to make syntactic analysis of source language to deal with the long distance reordering and translation, and the identification of Chinese prepositional phrases (PP) plays an important role in this analysis.

A fter analyzing sentences of 500 Chinese patent texts, we find that a patent se n-tence contains approximately 1.9 prepositional phrases (PP) in average, and the ave r-age length of each PP is 12.3 Chinese characters, while in news corpus PP contains only 4.9 characters in average [2]. T herefore, the iden tification of PP in patent texts is concerned in this paper, and we will present a method based on semantic analysis . After fully considering the functions and contextual information of PPs, we classify all prepositions into two semantic categories, and de fine some contextual features for each. I n the analysis, phrase boundaries and syntax level are successively determined based on search algorithm and semantic rules. A s a result, the correct identification of PPs can help to achieve better results in predi cate identification and syntactic reorde r-ing.

A fter integrat ing our method into an online patent MT system running in SIPO (State Intellectual Property Office of People's Republic of China) 1 , we take a closed test and an open test. T he result shows that ou r method has improved the performance of patent translation .

A fter a discussion of related work in section 2 , we will introduc e the semantic fe a-steps , and section 5 gives the experiment and evaluation . F inally we draw some co n-clusions in section 6 . Chinese prepositional phrase differs a lot from English in locations and functions. For this reason, the identification of PP becomes a procedure of crucial importance in Chinese -English machine translation. 
Researchers find that PP mainly served as attri bute, adverbial, complement or other adjuncts, and verbs in PP cannot be core predicates. Thus with the identification of PPs, we can narrow down the list of probable predicates, and the syntactic analysis can also be greatly simplified [2][3].

In recent y ears, a number of statistical methods have been proposed to make text chunking, an intermediate step towards full parsing. PPs, as well as other type of phrases, are identified in this analysis with statistical models such as HMM, max i-mum entropy, SVM and so on [4]. In order to deal specifically with the identification of PPs, linguistic rules are integrated into the statistical methods, which have greatly improved the identification result [5]. However, existing methods perform poorly in identifying PPs i n patent sentences. As mentioned above, PPs in Chinese patent texts are often quite long with complica t-ed structures, which may contain nested phrases, or even clauses. In addition, phrase boundaries are often omitted. While in most statistical systems, ph rase boundaries are determined by probabilities depending on features of no more than 5 words. More o-ver, in both statistical models and linguistic rules, words X  features and contextual information are very limited, including only word collocations and part of speeches. On account of data sparseness and limited features, it turns out to be extremely diff i-cult for existing systems to perform well in PP identification in patent corpus.
To solve this problem, we will describe an approach based on semantic analy sis, which employs more contextual information and features of prepositions, including their semantic categories, functions, positions, collocations, ambiguities and so on. With the identification of phrase boundaries and their syntax levels, we can parse and reorder a sentence more explicitly. 3.1 Semantic Categories One of the important differences between Chinese and English is the function of prepositions. I n this part, we will define two semantic categories to draw a clear di s-tinction of them.

I n the view of semantics, sentences are composed of propositions and arguments, rather than phrases in syntactic structures. F or example, semantic roles are used to make s hallow semantic analysis in Proposition Bank [6]. S entences are annotated with two types of roles, thematic and adjunct. T hematic roles mainly refer to the a c-tion or state described by a sentence's predicate, such as agent, patient and exper i-encer, while adjunct roles represent auxiliary information which is not structurally dispensa ble in a sentence, such as time, location and manner.

English prepositions mainly introduce adjunct roles, while Chinese prepositions i n-troduce both two types of roles. A s shown in table 1, Chinese prepositions can be classified into two categories accordi ng to the semantic roles 2 they introduce.
SC is the abbreviation of Semantic Cat egory. In our knowledge base, 1 5 Chinese prepositions are labeled as SC[0], and 110 prepositions as SC[1]. 3.2 Word Collocations T o identify a phase in a sentence, we need to determine the left and right boundaries. A s to Chinese prepositional phrase, the left boundary is the preposition, while the right boundary strongly depends on word collocations. W e note that SC0 and SC1 are col located with different components in sentences, and these are important features for the identification of PPs.

SC0s are special Chinese prepositions which are used to emphasize a part of the sentence , or to make nuance of the meaning by changing the word order . E ach SC0 must appear together with a predicate. A s shown in sentence 1,  X  and  X  a re two Chinese SC0 prepositions .  X  is collocated with  X  X  , while  X  is collocated with  X   X  . T hus the predicates in a sentence can help to determine the right boundary of P Ps.
Sentence 1  X  X   X   X  X  X  X   X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ( An adhesive activated by ultraviolet secure s the sensor housing to the middle bracket. )
Similar to English prepositions, SC1 don  X  t collocate with predicates. T hey are used independently or in collocation with postpositions. T he prepositional phases begi n-ning with SC1 can be modifiers of either predicates or noun phrases. I n sentence 2,  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  X  X  X  are two PPs beginning with SC1s. W e can note that  X  is collocated with postposition  X  , while  X  X  X  occurs independently. I n sentence 3, there is no postposition after  X  X  X  , but the conjunction  X  can suggest the right boundary.

Sentence 2  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X   X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ( In the following cellulose acylate resins, met h-ods for processing a cellulose acylate film, etc. suitably used for the present invention will be described in detail following the procedures. )
Sentence 3  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X  ( Such sharing can be achieved through spread spectrum digital modulation .) 3.3 Verb Valency Many linguistic theories proposed that a verbal predicate and its arguments can form a predicate -argument structure, in which the a rgument s help to complete the meaning of the predicate [7][8]. V erb valency (VV) refers to the number of arguments in the stru c-ture, and it is an important feature to help us identify SC0 prepositions in sentences. Sentence 4 Jane sent me a letter.
 Sentence 5 Tom hits Bob.

I n sentence 4, sent is a predicate with 3 arguments ( Jane, me, letter ), so its valency is 3. I n sentence 5, hit has only 2 arguments( Tom, Bob ), so its valency is 2. I n th e knowledge base, we label the verb valency for each verb as VV[1], VV[2] or VV[3]. T his value has played an important role in the identification of PPs, which will be discussed in detail in the following section. 3.4 Syntax Level boundary for each preposition. Here we define a LEVEL value for PPs according to same as its preposition  X  s. However, the LEVEL values of SC0 and SC1 depend on different factors.

As to PPs beginning with SC0 prepositions, the LEVEL value is determined by th e parent node of the PP. we define a PP as LEVEL[1] if it is a child node of S(sentence), as LEVEL[2] if it is a child node of NP.

Fig. 1 presents a syntax tree of sentence 1. W e can n ote that PP 2 (  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ) appears independently in the sentence, while PP 1 (  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ) is nested in a NP(noun phrase). B ase on this definition, we can give a syntax level analysis shown in table 2.
 *LB: left boundary; RB: right boundary
A s to PPs beginning with SC1 prepositions, we define the LEVEL value as fo l-lows. Given two PPs, PPi and PPj, if PPi is nested in PPj, then PPi is LEVEL[2], PPj is LEVEL[1]. Fig. 2 presents a sentence with two SC1 prepositions. We can also give a syntax level analysis of the PPs in table 3.
 the LB(left boundary), and W j be the RB(right boundary). T herefore, to identify a PP, we need to determine three parameters, W i , W j and the syntax level of the phrase. In this section, we will discuss the semantic analysis of PPs beginning with SC0 and SC1 separately . 4.1 The identification of PPs beginning with SC0 Chinese PP beginning with SC0 has no obvious right boundary(RB). However, as we mentioned above, each SC0 must appear together with a predicate, so the valency and location of verbs have played important roles in the identification.

A s shown in table 4, W i can be determined by the collocation of SC0 and a verb(W j+1 ), and there are four basic types of collocations, in which the right bound a-ry(RB) and syntax level of a PP are dependent on verb valency of W j+1 and its loc a-tion. I t is important that some collocations are not applicable to all SC0s. For exa m-details are considered in our semantic rules.

A fter fully considering the contextual information, we have made 43 rules for the identification, including 2 steps. I n step 1, PPs are identified as LEVEL 1. In step 2, the phrases are identified as LEVEL 2. I n our model, rules are circularly matched until the system has nothing new to output. I f a phrase is given multiple LEVEL va l-ues, take the last one. H ere Sentence 1 is taken as an example to illustrate the identif i-cation process.
 Sentence 1  X  X   X   X  X  X  X   X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  (An adhesive activated by ultraviolet secures the sensor housing to the middle bracket.) Step 1  X  and  X  are both identified as LEVEL[1] by matching Rule 1.
 Step 2  X  is identified as LEVEL[2] by matching Rule 2.
 Rule 1 (0)SC[0]+(f){(m)Verb&amp;VV[2]}+(m+1)CHN[  X  ,  X  ,  X  ,  X  ,  X  ,  X  ,  X  ] =&gt; LB(0)+ RB(m -1)+ PUT(LEVEL,1) Rule 2 (0)SC[0]+(f){(m)Verb&amp;VV[2]}+(m+1)CHN[  X  ] =&gt; LB(0)+RB(m -1)+ PUT(LEVEL, 2 ) After the analysis module,  X  X  X  X  X  X  is identified as a PP in LEVEL[2], and  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  is identified as PP in LEVEL[1].
 I n addition to the collocations of SC0s and verbs, we also find other information that can help to determine the level of SC0. F or example, i f a SC0 appears behind a SC1 preposition, numeral , quantifier or pronoun, we can put it in LEVEL[2] . 4.2 The identificat ion of PPs beginning with SC1s A s we discussed in section 3, SC1 prepositions mainly introduce adjunct roles, thus in most cases the PPs beginning with SC1s are modifiers of predicates or NPs. W ith SC1 as a certain left boundary, we need to determine the r ight boundary and syntax level PPs has LEVEL values. A fter analyzing 500 Chinese patent texts, we have found different contextual information and collocations for SC1 prepositions. Table 5 shows some basic identification patterns , and SC1 varies in different collocations. B ased on above conclusions, we have developed a 3 -S tep identification model. I n Step 1, LBs and RBs are generated in the positions of SC1s and postpositions. I n Step 2, we check if the LB or RB of current node is nested in another PP with search alg o-rithm, and give LEVEL value to the LB or R B of nested phrase through 12 semantic rules. I n Step 3, all PPs are generated and LEVEL values are given to the nested phrases. Here we take sentence 6 as an example to illustrate the semantic analysis. Sentence 6  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X   X   X  X  X  UI  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ( According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, by providing a dynamic image in a web browser, the range of a p-plications of the UI display method can be enlarged. ) Step 1  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ,  X  are identified as LBs, and  X  is identified as a RB.
 Step 2  X  is identified as LB in LEVEL[2],  X  is identified as RB in LEVEL[2]. Step 3 By matching the following 3 rules, the system generates three PPs, PP1(  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  )  X  PP2(  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ) and PP3(  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ). PP3 is given LEVEL[2].
 Rule 3 (0)LB&amp;CHN[  X  X  X  ]+(f)(m)CHN[  X  ]+(f)(0,m)!Verb=&gt;RB(m -1)+PP(0,m -1) Rule 4 (0)LB&amp;CHN[  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ,  X  ]+(f)(m)CHN[  X  ,  X  ,  X  ]=&gt;RB(m -1)+PP(0,m -1) R ule 5 (0) LB &amp;LEVEL[2]}+ (f)(m)RB&amp;LEVEL[2] =&gt; PP(0,m)+PUT(LEVEL,2) The experiment takes 500 authentic patent texts provided by SIPO (State Intellectual Property Office of China) as the training set. The evaluation will use the development data for the NTCIR -9 Patent Machine Translation Pilot Task 3 , containing 2,000 bili n-gual Chinese -English sentence pairs.

After integ rating the method into a Chinese -English patent machine translation sy s-te m [9] , we take a closed test on training set , and an open test on evaluation set. T he PPs after semantic analysis. Necessarily, only when the LB, RB and syntax level of a PP are all correctly identified, we count it as a correct identification. I n the open test, BLEU score[10 ] is also employed to evaluate the translation performance. Table 6 shows the result of the closed test .

W e can note that the recall is lower than precision for both two types of PPs. Two reasons can account for this phenomenon. (1) The preposition is not recognized as a left boundary due to mistake s of segmentation and word sense disambiguation. F or example,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  is a PP beginning with  X  (SC0), but  X  X  X  is segmented as a word. I n the sentence  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ,  X  is identified as a verb mod i-fier , not a preposition . (2) In this system, we make strict conditions for the generation of PPs, which might also result in a lower recall.

I n the open test, comparison is made as shown in table 7. RB -M T is the baseline system running on SIPO. HYBRID -MT is the system integrated with our semantic analysis. Google is an online statistical MT system, the identification result of which is inferred from its translation result, so we count it s identification as correct when the LB and RB are identified correctly, regardless of the syntax level and reordering r e-sult. The result of the open test shows that the semantic analysis has effectively improved the identification result of Chinese PPs, and Google performs poorly in this test. I t is mainly because statistical methods face difficulties in determining the RB of a l ong phrase, and technical texts(including patent texts) account for a fairly low proportion in the training bilingual corpus. T hus, our method is advantageous in processing tec h-nical texts with long and complicated sentences . I n addition , we find that the identif i-cation result of PPs with SC1 is generally better than PPs with SC0. A ccording to statistics, about 40% PPs with SC1 have postpositions as the certain right boundaries, while PPs with SC0 does not have any obvious right boundaries, the identificati on of which mainly depends on contextual information. A fter calculating the precision and recall, we give the BLEU -4 score of the three system s shown in table 8.
 F rom table 8, we can see that after integrating the semantic analysis, the BLEU score has increased by 11.82% from 0.1997 to 0.2233 . H owever, the BLEU scores of three systems all not very high, the highest is 0.3076 of Google. I t is mainly because the corpus domain is not limited, unknown terms or entities may result i n a bad translation performance, a nd in BLEU -4 evaluation, sentence will be given a score of 0 if it does not have at least one 4 -gram match . Besides, we need to note that Google performs better in word selection, so our system needs to improve this module urgently.

A fter the experiment, we also make analysis of the identification errors and su m-marize 5 problems that need to be solved in the fut ure. (1) A sentence may contain multiple verbs, which would interfere with the semantic rules; (2) PPs across comma and PPs of nesting level  X 3 have not been considered yet; (3) There are labeling mi s-takes in the knowledge base that needs a careful review; (4) Preprocessing module (word segmentation and sense disambiguation) as we mentioned above also needs to be improved; (5) Our method is strongly dependent on the completeness of rules , which still need to be complemented. To deal with the iden tification of Chinese prepositional phrases in patent sentences , we present a method based on semantic analysis, and integrate it into a source la n-guage parser for patent machine translation.

B y identifying PPs of two semantic categories, o ur method has en hanced the pe r-formance of patent machine translation. In the future, the rule set and knowledge base need to be improved, as well as the other analysis modules in the MT system. F u r-thermore, our identification method can be extended to language parsing of technical texts in other fields.
