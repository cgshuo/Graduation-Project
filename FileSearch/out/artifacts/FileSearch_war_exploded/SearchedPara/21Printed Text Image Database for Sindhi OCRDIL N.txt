 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) performs segmentation, extraction, and recogni-tion of text from text images. This text may be noncursive (e.g., Latin), cursive (e.g., Arabic), or a mixture of both [Rani 2011]. OCR extracts information from a text image and produces an editable text. A very rich language and a language rich in literature, like Sindhi, still lacks and needs significant attention in character recognition. Signif-icant research has been carried on a number of other scripts such as Latin, Chinese, Indian, and Arabic scripts [Parvez 2013; Slimane 2013], and OCRs are available for these scripts. Sindhi OCR is very much needed because of its rich literature. We have developed a huge database for the Sindhi characters, words, lines, and paragraphs in various fonts and sizes. The database is a part of Sindhi OCR research work. The database contains data from various sources such as Sindhi websites, newspaper web-sites, literary books, common boy X  X  and girl X  X  names, caste names, city names, theses, and translations of the Holy Quran. We have also developed a custom-built applica-tion that creates images from the collected text documents. The application can create hundreds of images per minute in 150 different fonts. A total of 150 specially built fonts for Sindhi were selected for creating the images. The images can be created in all available font sizes. The custom-built application can also create text images in various colors and gray levels, and both types of binary images. The foreground and background colors can also be changed to increase the versatility of the database. The purpose of developing a Sindhi printed text image database is for testing and training in OCR. The database can also be used for validating samples and eliminating errors [AbdelRauf et al. 2008]. The database is divided into different sections based on various font sizes. Moulana Ubaidullah Sindhi has named the Sindhi language as one of the early lan-guages sent from heaven, and all other languages are derived from these languages [Alana 2004]. The historical background can be revealed from the archaeological site Mohenjo-daro ( ). Perhaps Sindhi is a branch of Sanskrit. The Sindhi lan-guage is an old language and rich in literature and history. It was written in various scripts. Some of the common scripts are Arabic, Devanagari, and Roman, and some of the variations are shown in Figure 1. Nowadays, the Arabic script is widely used for writing Sindhi language. The Sindhi language alphabet is the largest extension of the original Arabic script. It contains 52 letters, compared to 28 for Arabic, 39 for Urdu (some instances say 38), 44 for Pashto, and 32 for Persian scripts. Figures 2 and 3 show the Sindhi alphabet and numerals used in Sindhi script, respectively. These additional characters are distinct from the characters of the Arabic alphabet and produce differ-ent sounds that are not available in the Arabic language and they mostly possess four dots. Sindhi text is written from right to left, whereas the numerals are written from left to right. All three formats for numerals (Figure 3) are commonly used in writing Sindhi language. Figure 4 shows an example of writing with both text and numerals.
Sindhi characters are cursive and possess more than one shape; they change their shape according to their position in a word and their connection to the preceding or succeeding characters as shown in Figure 5.

Some Sindhi characters have a number of dots and various placements and orien-tations of dots. Some of the character shapes have the same base but have a different number of dots at a different position, and those with more than one dot have a different orientation of the dots. A single additional dot added to one character base shape pro-duces another character. In Figure 6, character (  X  ), the fourth letter from the right, will become (  X  ), the third character from left. The character base shape (  X  ) in the Arabic al-phabet only produces three distinct letters ( ), whereas in Sindhi the same base shape produces these three and an additional six distinct letters ( ) (Figure 6). AbdelRauf et al. [2008] created a printed words database for the Arabic script com-prising 6 million words. The database also contains Pieces of Arabic Words (PAW) and Naked Pieces without diacritics (NPAW). They highlighted the characteristics of the Arabic script and difficulties in recognition of Arabic text. The database contains se-lected texts from the Holy Quran, a PhD thesis, Arabic dictionaries, old Arabic books, an Arabic website on the basis of various topics (e.g., children, religion, and women), and Arabic news websites (e.g., AlAhram, AlAkhbar, and AlHayat). The database contains 6 million words, 14,017,370 PAWs and NPAWs, and a total of 28,446,993 characters. The average number of repetitions ranges from 21.23 to 425.85 for PAWs and NPAWs. The average number of characters per word is 4.74, and for PAWs and NPAWs, the average is 2.03 and 2.33, respectively.

Rahman [2010] discussed the Sindhi corpus collection, preprocessing as well as tok-enization. The discussion includes the script and orthography of the Sindhi language, such as diacritics, numbers, and characters. The data were collected from six newspaper websites, blogs, and other websites, and the processing functions were implemented in C#. The data were converted to UTF-16 and normalization was performed. Tok-enization is performed by applying special characters, and the white space boundary problem is overcome by applying the technique by Ijaz and Hussain [2007]. The corpus contains 13,968,112 characters, and the distribution of bigram and trigram is presented by frequency.

Mahmoud et al. [2014] reported a comprehensive Arabic handwritten database known as khatt (Arabic for handwriting) of 1,000 writers from various countries. A single writer has to write a form of four pages. The database contains 1,000 forms of writing containing 9,327 lines of text randomly selected from 2,000 paragraphs. The database is divided into 70% for training, 15% for testing, and 15% for verification. The forms were scanned in three resolutions of 600, 300, and 200 DPI. Ground truth is available in text and XML form. An HMM and syntactic classifier is used for the ex-periments. The data were collected from 46 sources containing health, history, nature, social, management, and other information. The verification process was initiated at the form, ground truth, paragraph, and line levels. Arabic handwriting recognition was performed on 6,712 Arabic text lines.

Slimane et al. [2009] created a synthetic Arabic database containing 10 font fami-lies, 10 font sizes (six to 24 points), and four styles of the font called Arabic Printed Text Images. A total of 250 million characters along with ground truth written in XML file, which contains characters, words, and pieces of Arabic words in the form of nondecomposable and decomposable images, are included in the APTI database.
Pechwitz et al. [2002] created an image database for handwritten Arabic documents containing 26,459 village/town names (words) consisting of 210,000 characters written by 411 subjects who filled 2,265 forms. Of the 411 subjects selected, two-thirds are under 31 years old, and two-thirds of them (under 31 years) are students. The database contains 946 names of Tunisian cities and their postcodes. The forms were written with the name of cities and the users were asked to write the names of the cities and their postcodes that had not been processed. The forms were scanned with 300 DPI, and binary images were formed. For the horizontal slope correction, a black line at the bottom was drawn. An advanced projection method was employed for correction of vertical slope. A total of 26,459 town name images consisting of 115,585 PAWs and 212,211 characters were collected. The database is freely available for research purposes and can be requested by sending an email to any of the authors.

Al-Ohali et al. [2003] developed a check database for handwritten Arabic words that includes Arabic words and other information on Arabic checks. Data collection was carried out on 7,000 gray-level images of Al Rajhi Banking and Investment Corpora-tion with personal information removed. The data were divided into random (4,000) and selected (3,000) sets. Preprocessing such as binarization and tagging is applied to these checks, followed by automatic validation, which involves validating 83% of the tagged checks. The database contains 2,499 of legal amounts written in numbers, 29,498 subwords, 2,499 courtesy amounts written in Indian digits, and 15,175 Indian digits. Testing and training data were divided into two categories, touching and non-touching amounts. They extracted data from 3,000 checks to create the database, and the remaining checks require more processing for future research.

Parker et al. [2011] created a newswire-based Arabic text database at the University of Pennsylvania and named it Arabic Gigaword Fifth Edition, which contains all of its fourth edition data as well. The database contains a total of 1,004 files consisting of nearly 5 gigabytes of data. The data is in paragraph format and a full-page format of Arabic text taken from various Arabic newspapers, namely, Asharq Al-Awsat, An Nahar News Agency, Ummah Press, and six others. The database and OCR systems built for Arabic script and other scripts adopting the Arabic alphabet are still inadequate. OCR for Sindhi, which adopts the Arabic alphabet, is different from the Arabic OCR since the Sindhi alphabet has additional characters and therefore additional challenges. Some of the challenges in implementing Sindhi OCR include handling these additional characters, characters with four dots, additional ligatures, additional base shapes, and characters formed by two existing characters. The details of these implementation challenges are presented in Hakro et al. [2014]. The existing Arabic script databases cannot be used for Sindhi OCR because Sindhi script contains characters that are not available in the Arabic alphabet or other scripts adopting the Arabic alphabet. Thus, it is impossible to train and test Sindhi characters using the Arabic text image database. So, a separate and comprehensive database is needed for the Sindhi OCR system. A custom application was built to fit our needs. The software creates the text image from text, crops extra spaces without text using a cropping algorithm, and converts the text images into a number of desired options (font, size, angle, and weight). Figure 7 illustrates the diagram of the custom-built application developed for creating images. The custom-built software takes input from a text file. The font size, font family name, font weight, and font angle can be selected by the user as shown in Figure 8. In the case of no option being selected by the user, a message box is generated notifying one of the default values, that is, the font type MB Latifee, font size as 24, and font weight and font angle as normal. The user can select any font family and size available in the system. The images are created with extra spaces available on the image. These extra spaces are cropped by another algorithm, which is called by pressing the crop button as shown in Figure 9. This algorithm crops extra spaces and generates the same image output without extra spaces in the background. Finally, if needed, the images can be converted into grayscale or binary as shown in Figure 10(a), before complement, and Figure 10(b), after complement. The image documents are cropped and converted all at once by pressing a single button. Some of the generated images in various fonts X  families, sizes, and orientations are shown in Figure 11. The database contains 4.057 billion words of the Sindhi language collected from var-ious sources such as Sindhi literary books, magazines, websites, newspaper websites, common boys X  and girls X  names, common caste names, names of districts and cities, names of countries with capitals, dictionaries, translation of Holy Quran, and several PhD theses. The data were collected and converted into images by the custom-built software, which converts input text in various fonts, sizes, colors, gray levels, and bi-nary images. Another application that can be called from the custom-built software is crop, which also converts all of the images simultaneously in gray level and binary. The details of collected documents are as follows: Books: Several publishers were visited and various poetry and literary books were collected. Some acquaintances also helped by providing books on request. These books were fed as input to the custom-built application and converted into images of different colors and sizes in gray level as well as binary formats. The examples are shown in Figure 12.
 Magazines: We collected multiple volumes of the Sindhi Magazine Saranga in text form and in hard copy for scanning. Examples are given in Figure 13.
 Website materials including books: Various Sindhi literary websites were visited for the collection of Sindhi text. We collected materials available at Sindhi websites, including books, articles, short columns, and other text-form data to be fed into the custom-built software. Some of the website snapshots are given in Figure 14.
 Newspaper websites: We collected materials from Sindhi newspaper websites. The websites were visited and the data were collected in image form or text form to be converted using the custom-built application. The common newspapers include Daily Kawish, Hilal-e-Pakistan, Awami Awaz, Daily Sobh, and Daily Sindh. Snapshots of some of the newspaper websites are given in Figure 15.
 Common boys X  and girls X  names: We collected commonly used boys X  and girls X  names in Sindh. These common boys X  and girls X  names were collected in English; these lists were collected from university hostels and were translated and written in Sindhi. A total of 1,088 boys X  names and 893 girls X  names were written and converted to images in various fonts, sizes, and colors in gray levels and binary formats and with various background colors. Some of the common boys X  and girls X  names are given in Figure 16. Caste names: The lists of students in a university hostel were collected in English and the caste names were written in Sindhi. These common caste names in Sindh were converted into images using the custom-built software. Some of the examples are shown in Figure 17.
 Names of district and cities: District names were collected from the Government of Sindhi website and the list of voters. These names of the district along with the names of their cities were also collected, and the names were converted into text images with the help of the custom-built application. Figure 18 is the illustration of images created from district names X  text data.
 Countries and capitals: Countries X  names with their respective capital names were collected from the Internet in English language and into converted Sindhi writing. These country names of the world and the names of their capitals were converted into text images and included in this database to increase the versatility of the database. Some country names and capitals are given in Figure 19.
 Translation of the Holy Quran: A translation of the Holy Quran in Sindhi by Moulana Amroti available at http://www.Tanzil.net was downloaded and added to the database. A total of 604 pages of the Holy Quran translation were downloaded and converted into text images. Figure 20 is the illustration of one of the 604 pages of the Holy Quran translation text in Sindhi. Figure 20(a) is the original text downloaded from http://www.Tanzil.net, and Figure 20(b) shows some of the images created with the custom-built software.
 Shah Jo Risalo: A poetry book of a very famous poet and Sufi of the Sindh Valley, Shah Abdul Latif Bhittae, called Shah Jo Risalo, was collected in text form and images were created. Some of the images created from Shah Jo Risalo are given in Figure 21 along with the front page of the book.
 PhD theses: We collected two PhD theses and converted texts of these two PhD theses into images; the first is on Sindhi literature of Shikarpur district of Sindh and the other on the poetry aspects of Sindhi literature. The theses were collected in MS Publisher format and converted into plain text and images were created. The MS Publisher format and an example of the images created are given in Figure 22.
 All of the collected materials were converted into text images using various fonts and sizes so that the researchers can get more benefit from them and the database can be used for various options. Images can be created using all available sizes of the fonts. The custom-built application is capable of creating a font size supported by system. Table I depicts some of fonts that were used for creating the database. The database contains 4.057 billion words of Sindhi text in various fonts and styles. The text was arranged in single word images (boys X  and girls X  names), double word images (countries and their capitals), single line images (poetry books), and paragraphs and pages (books and newspaper). Table II shows the details of words, characters with spaces and characters without spaces, and other details regarding the database.
The number of pages depends on the fonts used in the word processor as they vary ac-cording to font size and font family. Paragraphs may vary, as in poetry books one line is considered as a paragraph. A total of 1,690,519 words were collected and converted into various fonts, sizes, weights, and angles. These options (for font, size, weight, and angle) are available in MATLAB. The whole database contains 8,017,155 Sindhi characters with spaces. The database contains 6,364,980 characters in 150 fonts (a total of 190, where some of them are not suitable for the database), four different font weights, and four font angles. Table III shows the numbers of words and characters in the database.
The database was checked for the number of occurrences of the characters, and their percentage of occurrences is given in Table IV. The percentage is calculated from the total number of characters including other characters (e.g., numbers, question marks, exclamation marks, and others) that make up 7.40% of all the contents of the database. Table IV also presents the number of occurrences of a single character in the Sindhi alphabet as well as in the whole database.

The database was checked for the specific shape of character in the database and all characters are given in Table V. Some of the characters possess only two shapes, as shown in Table V. The database was also checked for the percentage of occurrences of character shapes in the whole database as well as the percentage of occurrences of shapes in the alphabet. Table VI is the illustration of the distribution of percentages of character shapes in a character. For development of Sindhi OCR, the basic need is the database for training and testing. For this purpose, significant efforts were made to build this huge multifont, multistyle, and multisize gigaword image database. This will open a new window for researchers working on printed Sindhi optical character recognition. The database contains billions of words and characters in various fonts for training and testing with ease. Custom-built software produces images from the text with a number of options for setting.
With the help of our custom software, more and more books will be added and words in the billions will grow into trillions. Scanned materials such as books and magazines will be added and handwritten data will be created and added to this database so that researchers around the world can benefit from this free database.
