 A longstanding shortcoming of systems analysis and design, software engineer-ing, business informatics, and enterprise architecture is the lack of readily usable and easily teachable concepts, frameworks, tools, and methods that bridge the gap between two worlds. Those worlds are the people-and business-oriented sociotechnical world of business professionals and the abstract, technology-centric world of IT professionals and IS/IT researchers. That gap contributes to widely recognized difficulties in communicating and collaborating around cre-ating, implementing, and improving ITreliant systems in organizations. Some experienced consultants and consulting companies have proprietary methods, but those are not readily available for use by others.
 This tutorial explains the most updated version of WST and related ideas that were developed over several decades. WST has three components [ 1 , 2 ]: 1. the definition of work system 2. the work system framework, a static view of the work system as it exists during a particular time interval when it retains its identity and integrity even though it may change slightly through small adaptations, workarounds, personnel changes, and even unintentional drift 3. the work system lifecycle model, a dynamic view of how work systems change over time through a combination of planned and unplanned change.
WSM applies WST but is not part of WST. WSM is designed to help busi-ness professionals, IT professionals, students, and researchers think about current and proposed work systems. Various versions of WSM all involve identifying the main problems or opportunities that launched an analysis, identifying the small-est work system that exhibits those problems or opportunities. summarizing the  X  X s is X  work system using a formatted one page table, evaluating the work sys-tem X  X  operation at an appropriate level of detail, summarizing changes that will appear a proposed  X  X o be X  work system, and describing the likely improvement in work system performance. WSM has been used by many hundreds of MBA or Executive MBA students in the United States, China, Vietnam, and India to produce preliminary management briefings about possible improvements in real world work systems in their own organizations [ 1 , 3 , 4 ].

Recent developments include extensions of WST into areas that were not anticipated in the earlier research, such as work system principles [ 1 ], work sys-tem design spaces [ 1 ], various versions of a work system metamodel [ 2 , 5 ], linkages between WST and service systems [ 5 , 6 ], possible uses of WST as a front end to object oriented analysis and design [ 7 ], possible links between WST and BPM [ 8 ], a theory of workarounds [ 9 ], and possible uses of the work system framework as part of a scaffolding for a body of knowledge related to information systems and other systems in organizations [ 10 ].
