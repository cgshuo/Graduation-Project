 1. Introduction
A critical factor of productivity in an industry is the timely maintenance of its installations; improving maintenance perfor-mance is thus a key objective. Developing an effective mainte-nance program requires extensive knowledge about reliability and ing, which provides the theoretical and practical tools through which the probability and capacity of components ful fi ll their required functions in determined periods of time without failures analysis is capable of working with samples as small as two or three failures for engineering analysis; moreover, it is fl enough to provide a good fi t for a wide variety of data sets. calculations, the Weibull analysis provides the information required for troubleshooting, classifying failure types, scheduling preventive maintenance and scheduling inspections ( Dodson, 1994 ). This model has been widely used in the reliability because of its properties; e.g., the parameters have an interpreta-tion related to the component and its failure mode.

In the process of applying the Weibull analysis (testing a component), the data obtained sometimes cannot be recorded or collected precisely due to unexpected case scenarios. Since the failure times in many cases are not observable and the censoring mechanism may or may not be known, new approaches have been developed. For example, at petroleum installation plants, there is usually not enough information for elaborating an inspection plan, thus, the Weibull parameters are estimated by means of opinions from experts, MTTF or other methods. For such scenarios, the sample contains only censored data; hence, the likelihood method is not applicable, which introduces a high degree of uncertainty in the parameters estimation. Moreover, the lifetime of the compo-nents cannot be measured precisely. Because of all these reasons, researches have been drawn to the fuzzy set theory to reliability analysis ( Hsien Chung (2004) ). The papers edited by Onisawa and Kacprzyk (1995) provided plentiful approaches to fuzzy reliability. Li (2008) showed the modeling of periodic preventive mainte-nance policies of a system and its parameter estimation of failure distribution and restoration effects on the degradation rate. A fuzzy system was built using the Particle swarm optimization method. The performance of the fuzzy system was used as a fi tness function to guide the search in Particle swarm optimiza-tion. Marano et al. (2008) proposed a reliability of reinforced concrete structures; an ef fi cient alternative approach was made by considering fuzzy time-dependent reliability analysis. Sharma et al. (2008) proposed the combination of qualitative and quanti-tative techniques for risk and reliability analysis of a paper mill where fuzzy synthesis of failure and repair data fuzzy arithmetics had been used. A new intelligent system for detecting the occurrence of a fault in machinery in real time was proposed by Wang (2008) ; this approach uses a monitoring reliability by integrating the predicted machinery conditioned to fault diagnosis. Hsien Chung (2004) ) realized a Bayesian estimation on lifetime data assuming the parameters as a fuzzy random variables with fuzzy prior distributions. The author used the conventional Bayesian estimation method to create the fuzzy Bayes point estimator, considering gamma and exponential distributions for complete and censored samples. Cai (1996) mentions some applications of the fuzzy methodology in system failure engineering which traces back to contributions by Kaufmann and Gupla (1988) . An interest-ing application related to the present work is fuzzy methodology in mechanical/structural reliability. When a system failure occurs as the system stress (load) exceeds the system strength (resistance), the system behavior can be fuzzy too. Mosleh et al. (2011) devel-oped a hybrid method based on fuzzy neural network for approx-imating fuzzy coef fi cients of fuzzy polynomial regression models with fuzzy output and crisp inputs. They proposed an algorithm from the cost function of the fuzzy neural network.

Regarding the application of fuzzy theory in engineering reliability, Bowles and Pel X ez (1995) showed the applications of the main concepts of the fuzzy logic, fuzzy arithmetic and linguistic variables for the analysis of system structures, fault trees, the reliability of degradable systems and its probability of occurrence. Recently, Pereguda and Timashov (2010) proposed a fuzzy reliability model for automated complex system, which assumes that parameters of reliability model and reliability indices are fuzzy variables. Their approach allows taking into account the uncertainty of reliability model parameters and reliability indices. they mentioned that the analytical equations for calculating fuzzy reliability indices of machine part could not be obtained in most cases. Chadna and Ram (2013) stated that given the fact that reliability parameters are often subjectively or ill-de fi conventional measurement approaches cannot effectively handle the vagueness and ambiguity which exist within reliability para-meters; hence, fuzzy theory is rather useful. In this research the authors applied the fuzzy reliability evaluation approach to merit the input failure rates of a system; fuzzy reliability indices were evaluated by means of linguistic variables assessed by experts.
Conversely, although classical concepts of statistics, such as estimators, con fi dence intervals and tests of hypotheses, which have their interpretations in terms of frequencies, were widely improvement of reliability of components and systems have tions ( Hryniewicz, 2007 ). Hryniewicz presents only main ideas and results that have been published in a few papers, related to the reliability analysis of systems with the usage of imprecise probabilities. Bearing in mind the previous work referenced above, the need for a new method for reliability analyzing when ill-de fi ned or subjective information is handled.

In this sense, for modeling data with certain de fi ciencies, for instance, when there are no failures (only censored data) or few failures, we propose using the Weibayes methodology ( Abernethy, 2008 ). Such methodology constructs a Weibull distribution by fi xing the shape parameter. Although, Abernethy proposes a method to estimate the parameters of the probabilistic model, the uncertainty caused by the lack of information about the components of the process is not considered. Furthermore, the author is not proposing any means for modeling subjective information. Therefore, knowing that in engineering reliability the parameters have a speci fi c interpretation, we propose to model shape parameter considering the engineering knowledge of physics of the failure by means of fuzzy numbers (with triangular functions); as a result, fuzzy failure probability and fuzzy MTTF were obtained. Accordingly, this work presents a methodological framework in which a drawback in maximum likelihood parametric estimation (MLE) due to only censored data can be improved, speci fi cally for the Weibull MLE process for reliability engineering application.

In the application, results show that our proposed method is easier to implement and that estimations are equally or more reliable than the classical method in the case of heavily censored data. Moreover, the proposed method represents a reliable option for including expert knowledge about the component as well as the physics of the failure mode; hence, it is a novel methodology.
In addition, inspection time was estimated based on target risk; those results could be used to develop maintenance plans and to establish inspection frequencies. 2. Reliability engineering
As stated before, a critical factor of productivity in an industry is the timely maintenance of its installations, and thus mainte-nance's performance is a key objective. Developing an effective maintenance program requires extensive knowledge about relia-bility and maintainability; parametric analysis (which uses prob-
Let the probability distribution function F  X  x  X  represent the results obtained in a random experiment. Then for a given number
This function is denominated the cumulative distribution function of the variable X and represents the probability that the variable takes a value from 1 to x . Thus, if T is a random variable that represents the component life and assuming that T has a cumu-lative distribution function F  X  t  X  expressed by F  X  t  X  X  P  X  T the density probability function f  X  t  X  is expressed as follows ( Nahmias, 2009 ): f  X  t  X  X  dF  X  t  X  dt  X  1  X  this function is de fi ned as the probability that a new component survives no longer than time t and is expressed as follows ( Mann et al., 1974 ): R  X  t  X  X  P f T r t g X  1 F  X  t  X  X 
In the reliability theory there is a fundamental relationship the lifetime is a positive random variable with density function f  X  t  X  and cumulative function F  X  t  X  ; then the function  X   X  t  X  X  f  X  t  X  1 F  X  t  X   X  f  X  t  X  R  X  t  X   X  3  X  de fi nes the failure hazard rate. This function represents the instantaneous change over the conditional probability at an instant t . It can be regarded as a probability measurement of a component that has survived until time t , failing at the following instant ( Modarres et al., 1999 ). Knowing the failure rate now possible to construct its lifetime cumulative function given and the failure rate  X   X  t  X 
P  X  T 4 t  X  X  R  X  t  X  X  exp by representing the integral in the above equation as R d  X  log  X  1 F  X  t  X  X  . On the other hand, a random variable T is of increasing/decreasing failure rate type if the corresponding T A
IFR  X  DFR  X  if  X   X  t  X  is increasing (decreasing). Note that the exponential random variable is by de fi nition, of both IFR and DFR; for reliability theory, a phenomenon closely related to this fact is aging. This term means an increase of failure risk as a function of the time it has been used, hence, representing an appropriate measure of aging. The memory-less exponential dis-tribution re fl ects the  X  no aging  X  situation ( Gertsbakh, 2000 ).
A life time T A IFR shows an increasing failure risk and the in time, and the corresponding system becomes  X  younger  X 
Another approach to aging is considering the conditional survival probability R  X  x j t  X  , as a function of t , for an interval of ing that taking the derivative for R  X  x j t  X  X  exp  X  respect to t is not complicated, it is concluded that R  X  x j t  X  is decreasing (increasing) in t ,if  X   X  t  X  is increasing (decreasing).
Another important metric in reliability which has a great impact over maintenance performance is the MTTF (Mean Time To Failure), as described as follows ( Wang et al., 2007 ): E  X  t  X  MTTF  X  2.1. Weibull analysis
Throughout the introduction, the relevance of the Weibull analysis based on the Weibull probability parametric model for developing maintenance plans was stated. The cumulative dis-obtained in a random experiment. For a given number x , the probability P  X  X r x  X  is given by the function F  X  x  X  X  X  X then the denominated probability distribution function of the X variable and represents the probability that the variable takes a value from 1 to x . Thus, if T is a random variable that represents the component life time and assuming that T has a cumulative distribution function, F  X  t  X  can be expressed as F  X  t  X  X  P  X  T for the Weibull model is expressed as follows: F  X  t  X  X  1 e t =  X   X  X   X   X  6  X  given by f  X  t  X  X 
In addition, for the Weibull model, the function related to the probability that a new component does not survive longer than time t is set as follows ( Gertsbakh, 2000 ): R  X  t  X  X  1 F  X  t  X  X  e t =  X   X  X   X   X  8  X 
As previously stated, the hazard function described by Eq. (3) represents the instantaneous change on the conditional prob-has survived until time t fails at the following instant. For the
Weibull model this is described by  X   X  t  X  X 
Lastly, the Mean Time to Failure for the Weibull model ( Dodson, 1994 ) is given by
MTTF  X   X  X  1  X  1  X   X  10  X  2.2. Maximum likelihood method
The likelihood function L is the statistical expression for the probability of  X  and  X  , given the observed data. When the sample is complete, the likelihood function for the Weibull model is presented as L  X   X  ;  X  j t i  X  X   X  n However, if the sample contains censored data, the likelihood function is as follows ( Harrell, 2001 ): L  X   X  ;  X  j t i ; t j  X  X   X  r for i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; r and j  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; k  X  12  X 
The maximum likelihood method estimates the parameters  X  and  X  , by maximizing the logarithm of the likelihood function (11) or (12) , as the case. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of obtained after solving Eq. (13) using iterative procedures ( Dodson, 1994 ). 0  X  where n  X  r  X  k . In addition, the MLE of  X  is as follows: ^  X   X 
However, if there are no failure times (only censored data) in the sample, the MLEs of  X  and  X  are in fi nite (sometimes it is said that the MLE  X  does not exist  X  ); this is a rather daunting result because it is generally known that there would be failures at suf fi ciently long testing periods. If no failures have occurred, Eq. (14) with r  X  1 gives a conservative 63% lower con fi bound on the true value of  X  if we assume that the fi rst failure is imminent but it is not always possible (conservative here means that the true con fi dence level is unknown). However, without this assumption, it is possible to obtain an approximation for t ; lation with shape parameter  X  and scale parameter  X  ; then f t t ; ... ; t  X  n g represents a random sample drawn from an Exponential population with mean life  X   X   X   X  . Particularly, if there are no failures in the lifetime tested, and if the sample follows an Exponential distribution, a 100  X  1  X   X  % lower con fi dence bound on  X  is expressed as  X   X  the units are susceptible to a Weibull failure mode with known and unknown  X  , then a 100  X  1  X   X  % lower con fi dence bound on  X   X   X   X  is  X   X   X   X  Z Therefore  X  Z
This method is known as Weibayes, which constructs a Weibull distribution based on knowing or assuming a value of the Weibull slope parameter  X  . This parameter (shape) is assumed from historical failure data, from prior experience, or from engineering knowledge of the physics of the failure. So, this method is used where there are certain de fi ciencies in the sample, for instance, when there are no or few failures. Nelson (1985) provides methods for determining con fi dence bounds with Weibayes when failures are present, but there is no information for determining con-fi dence bounds when the sample contains only censored data ( Abernethy, 2008 ).

It is noticeable that in those cases the predicted life of the component depends solely on the shape parameter  X  , because the way the scale parameter  X  is estimated depends on a fi xed
Hence, the shape parameter  X  needs to be modeled with prior knowledge that only censored data is present, and that there is a high degree of uncertainty about the parameter. For this purpose, the theory of fuzzy numbers is advisable given the high degree of uncertainty. Note that, if the shape parameter is modeled by using fuzzy numbers, it will produce a fuzzy scale parameter and also fuzzy reliability. 3. Fuzzy numbers theory The concept of Fuzzy Logic (FL) was conceived by Lot fi Zadeh, a
Professor at the University of California at Berkley. FL was presented not as a control methodology, but as a way of processing data by allowing partially set membership rather than crisp set membership or non-membership. This theory was not applied to control systems until the 1970s due to insuf fi cient small-computer capability. Professor Zadeh reasoned that people do not require precise, numerical information input, and yet they are capable of highly adaptive information processing. FL provides a simple way to arrive at de fi nite conclusion based on vague, ambiguous, imprecise, noisy or missing input information. FL does not require precise inputs; it is inherently robust ( Yen and Langari, 2000 ).
There are different membership functions associated ( Mendel, 1995, 2000 ). Some of most common functions used are triangular; but bell, trapezoidal and exponential have been widely used as well ( Babuska, 2001 ).

Fuzzy Logic provides a completely different and an unorthodox way to approach a modeling problem. This method focuses on what the system should do rather than trying to understand how it works. One can concentrate on solving the problem rather than trying to model the system mathematically, if that is even possible. This almost invariably leads to quicker, cheaper solutions ( Tzafestas and Blekas, 1999 ). Once understood, this technology is and pleasing. 3.1. Fuzzy numbers
A fuzzy number is a quantity whose value is imprecise, rather than exact as is the case with ordinary (single-valued) numbers.
Any fuzzy number can be thought of as a function whose domain
In many aspects, fuzzy numbers depict the physical world more realistically than single-valued numbers ( Buckley, 2006 ). A trian-gular fuzzy number N is de fi ned by three numbers a o b o zoidal fuzzy number M is de fi ned by four numbers a o b o (where the membership equals one) is over [ b , c ]. We write M  X  fuzzy number N  X  X  1 : 5 ; 2 ; 2 : 5  X  ; see that N  X  2  X  X  1.
Modeling time to failure data uses triangle-shaped fuzzy numbers due to the statistical inference being constructed using uncertainty. Also, the fuzzy sets with alpha-cuts are best repre-sented by triangular shapes. Even though triangular shaped fuzzy numbers are used, the results can be extended to general fuzzy numbers. 3.2. Alpha-cuts
Alpha-cuts are slices through a fuzzy set producing regular (non-fuzzy) sets. If A is a fuzzy subset of some set  X  , then an of A , written as A [  X  ], is de fi ned as
A  X   X   X f x A  X  j A  X  x  X  Z  X  g X  18  X  a fuzzy number is the set of values where the membership value single point b, which represents the crisp number related to the fuzzy number. However, if M  X  X  a = b ; c = d  X  ,or M  X  a = the core of M  X  X  b ; c . For any fuzzy number Q we know that Q [ a closed, bounded, interval for 0 r  X  r 1. This is written as
Q  X   X   X  X  q 1  X   X   X  ; q 2  X   X   X   X  19  X   X  with q 1 (1) r q 2 (1). If Q is a triangular shaped or a trapezoidal shaped fuzzy number then: (1) q 1 (  X  ) will be a continuous, monotonically increasing function of  X  in [0, 1]; (2) q 2 a continuous, monotonically decreasing function of  X  ,0 r  X  r check monotone increasing (decreasing) by showing that dq d  X  4 0( dq 2 (  X  ) /d  X  o 0) holds.
 Let N  X  ( a/b/c ); given that N Z  X  ,  X  is a real number, if a N for triangular and trapezoidal shaped fuzzy numbers whose support is in the interval  X  a ; c .If A and B are two fuzzy subsets of a set  X  , then A r B means A  X  x  X  r B  X  x  X  for all x in 2006 ). 3.3. Fuzzy-arithmetic
Let A and B represent two fuzzy numbers. Let us also assume that alpha-cuts are closed, bounded intervals, so A  X   X   X  X  a a  X   X   X  and B  X   X   X  X  b 1  X   X   X  ; b 2  X   X   X  . Then if C  X  A  X  B we have
C  X   X   X  A  X   X   X  B  X   X  for all  X  in  X  0 ; 1 ; also, C  X   X   X  A  X   X  to B  X   X  for all  X  . This method is equivalent to the extension principle method of fuzzy arithmetic ( Klir and Yuan, 1995 ). alpha 3.4. Fuzzy functions: extension principle Any h :  X  a ; b -R may be extended to H  X  X  X  X  Z as follows: Z  X  z  X  X  sup x f X  X  x  X j h  X  x  X  X  z ; a r x r b g X  20  X 
This de fi nes the membership function of Z for any triangular fuzzy number X in  X  a ; b .If h is continuous, then we have a way to know and Qu, 1990 ): z  X   X   X  X  min f h  X  x  X j x A X  X   X  g  X  21  X  z  X   X   X  X  max f h  X  x  X j x A X  X   X  g  X  22  X  for 0 r  X  r 1. 4. Fuzzy reliability Classical reliability uses a suitable distribution (such as Weibull,
Exponential, Log-Normal or Gamma distribution among others ( Nelson, 1990 )) for modeling the behavior of the lifetime and estimating the failure probability as Pr  X  T r t  X  X  F  X  t the present work, we use fuzzy number theory (described through
Section 3 ), adapted to the classical probability for estimating reliability of a component including uncertainty and knowledge processing. 4.1. Fuzzy probability function The classical density function has the form f  X  t ;  X   X  , t parameter  X  . Hence, by using the extension principle (described in f  X  t ;  X   X  , for fuzzy numbers  X  4 0. Computing the fuzzy probability other subsets E of  X  . Therefore, for  X  A  X  0 ; 1 ,  X  A  X

R  X  c ; d  X   X   X  1
The hazard function given by (3) may be extended to a fuzzy hazard function. Taking into account the density function and
Eq. (28 ) a fuzzy hazard function is expressed as  X   X  c ; d  X   X   X  f  X  t ;  X   X j  X  A  X   X   X 
Moreover, the fuzzy mean is the fuzzi fi cation of the crisp mean given by Eq. (5). Let the fuzzy mean be M (fuzzy MTTF); then its alpha-cuts are given as ( Buckley, 2006 )
M  X   X   X  4.2. Fuzzy Weibull reliability
The value of 0 r  X  r 1 corresponding to  X   X   X   X  X   X  1  X   X   X  to its triangular shape implies that: for any fuzzy number a closed and bounded interval. In order to compute the fuzzy probability of obtaining a value in the interval c ; d , the fuzzy distribution given by (27) could be used. Note that for each fuzzy the theory discussed earlier, for the Weibull probability model (see Section 2.1 ), the fuzzy cumulative distribution function for the interval [ c , d ]is F  X  c ; d  X   X   X  e c =  X   X  X   X  e d =  X   X  X   X  ;  X  A  X   X   X  ;  X  A  X   X  Hence, from Eq. (8) , the fuzzy reliability function for the Weibull model is given by R  X  c ; d  X   X   X  1  X  e d =  X   X  X   X  e c =  X   X  X   X  ;  X  A  X   X   X  ;  X  A  X  Similarly, by using Eq. (26) , the fuzzy MTTF is given by MTTF  X   X   X   X  X  1  X  1  X  ;  X  A  X   X   X  ;  X  A  X   X   X   X  29  X  where  X   X  U  X  is the gamma function. 4.3. Establishing fuzzy parameters with only censored data
For engineering reliability it is well known that the parameters of the Weibull model have a speci fi c interpretation related to the process;  X  represents the characteristic life of the component and  X  represents the failure model. As a result, the aging (process knowledge) has a speci fi c interpretation related to the shape parameter  X  . When  X  o 1, a lifetime given by T A DFR (decreasing failure rate) represents a component which is suffering from infant mortality failures caused by defective materials, poor manufactur-ing or poor inspection. If  X   X  1 the Weibull distribution becomes an Exponential distribution and the memory-less re fl ects the aging  X  situation; that is, the component is characterized by a constant failure rate. Finally, if  X  4 1 a lifetime described by T (increasing failure rate) represents components that wear out with age (it represents wearing down material). Note that these three Weibull distributions are characterized at the bathtub curve ( Dodson, 1994 ).

For our case study, the sample consists only of censored times to failure; hence there are some options for estimating the parameters, considering the sample's characteristics.
Estimate the fuzzy parameters fr om available knowledge about the possible to solicit this estimate from experts much like estimating job times in project scheduling. Let a  X  the pessimistic value ,let c  X  the optimistic value and let b  X  the most likely value ,basedof course on probability results. Build the triangular fuzzy number  X  one ( Buckley, 2006 ). Do not disregard the relationships with the process that is being modeled; for example, the parameter of the exponential model represents the MTTF when there are not censored data in the sample, although this is not the case, it serves as an approximation. However, it is also possible to estimate the MTTF by expert's opinion.

Otherwise, take the mean value directly from the fuzzy times to the shape parameter as b  X  x where t represents the mean value of t , and x  X  1 n y  X  1 n
Then use this fi rst shape parameter approximation to determine the fuzzy shape parameter  X   X  X  a = b = c . Note that the value esti-mated by Eq. (30) could be used as b in the fuzzy shape parameter, whereas a could be determined by considering the process relationships (showed above) and c can be establishing by experi-ence or by means of c  X  a  X  X  b a  X  . Then, considering the fuzzy shape parameter  X  , the fuzzy approximation to the scale para-meter is determined by applying (17) as follows:  X  Z 2 6 6 4
Once the fuzzy parameters are de fi ned, it is necessary to calculate the alpha-cuts (explained in Section 3.2 ) corresponding to each parameter. Next steps require using Eqs. (27), (28) and (29) the fuzzy mean time to failure of any component, respectively. 5. Application
In order to illustrate the application of the proposed method, data related to the heat exchanger bundle (showed in Fig. 2 ) from the API RP 581 (2008) was used. The failure mode is leaking of tube; this component is often used in the re fi nery industry. The study model hoped to determine the probability of failure as a function of time-in-service for a hypothetical heat exchanger bundles, matching the following criteria: (1) tube side fl category is crude, (2) general corrosion as a damage mechanism, (3) tube side operating temperature range between 350 1 F and 500 1
F, (4) type: liquid process exchanger and (5) sulfur content greater than 1. API RP 581 states that the condition-based inspec-tion programs are limited since failure data for a particular bundle usually does not exist. Moreover, there is not enough data for it to be statistically signi fi cant.

The data was obtained from similar bundles found in the reliability database. It is assumed that the bundle has not been redesigned over its life time. Failure times are acquired from a
Weibull population. At the inspection, four suspensions (bundles in-service without failure reported) were found; the data is shown in Table 1 .

There are no failures in the sample; thus, the proposed method is advisable. Criteria 4 mentions that the failure mode is general corrosion (related to wearing out), so that the shape parameter should be  X  4 1. The document API assumes that the parameter is  X   X  3. Considering the failure mode and the API RP 581(2008) suggestion, we could estimate the parameters of the model by using fuzzy numbers represented by means of triangular func-tions. So, the distribution would be W(  X  ;  X  ), with  X  4
Hence, the fuzzy shape parameter estimated by using the second option ( Section 4.3 )was  X   X  X  3 = 10 : 36 = 17 : 72  X  and by applying Eq. (33) with a con fi dence level of 80%, the estimated fuzzy scale parameter was  X   X  X  27 : 209 = 28 : 926 = 47 : than 25 years. This is due to the bundle not presenting failure at this time; hence the estimation seems to be right. The parameters estimated are shown in Fig. 3 . Next the alpha-cuts [0  X  1by 0.1 increments] are obtained for each parameter by applying as well as the alpha-cuts, Eqs. (27)  X  (29) follow to compute the bundle's fuzzy reliability indexes. The results obtained by applying the proposed method are shown in Table 1 .

For the time to failure T  X  [0, 25], Figs. 4 and 5 show the fuzzy for each pair of parameters corresponding to each alpha-cut and the y axis represents the alpha-cuts. The fuzzy failure probability of the HE-115-T2 bundle ranges from 50.34  X  99%, having the highest peak in 86.54% which represents the estimated probability between c  X  0 and d  X  25. A great advantage of this method is that the estimated reliability considers the uncertainty related to the censored times to failure; the estimated reliability is a fuzzy probability number. Although the fuzzy reliability has a large interval due to the uncertainty considered, Fig. 4 shows that that the curve tends to high values of reliability. The curve indicates that at 25 years of service the bundle has low probability to fail, corresponding to reported failure from Table 1 . Therefore, fuzzy ing con fi dence bounds is not feasible; having only censored data obstruct variance estimations. Based on results shown, the pro-posed method represents an easy and reliable option.

Correspondingly, Fig. 5 shows the x axis at the estimated MTTF for each pair of parameters which corresponds to each alpha-cut.
The y axis represents the alpha-cuts. The MTTF of the component is between 24.297 and 45.922 years, having the highest peak in 27.56 years; this peak represents the MTTF estimated applying Eq. (10) using parameters  X   X  28 : 92 and  X   X  10 : 36.
On the other hand, forecasting the time to failure related to certain reliability requires computing the fuzzy quantile. Note that  X  has three components,  X   X  X  a = b = c where b represents the highest peak. Therefore, for estimating the fuzzy time to failure, certain fuzzy reliability is to be calculated by T  X   X  b f log  X  R  X  c ; d  X g 1 =  X  b  X  34  X  Hence, the fuzzy time to failure will be T  X  X  min  X  T b  X  for each alpha-cut the time obtained would be T  X   X   X  X  t 1 to the MTTF  X  27.56. Applying this proposed theory in establishing maintenance plans may follow two paths: (a) If it is desired to establish a preventive maintenance frequency based only on certain reliability (for preventive main-tenance involving costs and renewal see for example Gertsbakh (2000) or Zacks (1992) ), we could try predicting time to failure by means of the fuzzy quantile function given by Eq. (34). For example, if it is needed to replace a component before it fails for preventing human risk, as required in petroleum industry ( API RP more than 90%. alpha
Hence, if it is desired to establish an inspection frequency based to inspection will be T  X   X   X  X  23 : 279  X   X   X  ; 25 : 028  X  shows the related fuzzy time used to establish the inspection frequency. (b) On the other hand, the norm API RP 581 (2008) calculates the risk as a function of time, associated to the arithmetical product of the probability of failure by its consequence measured in fi nancial or area impact. So, the risk of the i th component is de fi ned by means of Eq. (35)
Risk  X  P i C i  X  35  X  where C i is the consequence of the i th event, which results from exposure to risk (a measure to damage or loss of the scenario) and
P measure is a function of the lifetime of the analyzed component.
Generally, a corporative risk target is established in function of the corporate philosophy used to make decisions about the risk involved; this fact has a direct impact over the inspection plan established. Then, considering Eq. (35) , the maximal acceptable corporative risk target is given by
P  X  Risk tgt C be established. This estimated time represents the moment in which the goal is reached. Now, if a corporative risk target is determined as a fuzzy number Risk tgt  X  X  65 ; 000 ; 75 ; 000 then
P i ; max also would be a fuzzy number. Table 2 shows the maximal acceptable probability for a given consequence as well as the target inspection time (for details about consequences estimation see API RP 581 (2008) ).

Having an estimated inspection time greatly simpli fi es devel-oping an inspection plan, according to the corporative risk target and considering the uncertainty contained in the component time to failure. Option (b) is most adequate in terms that it adjusts to company's philosophy; however it requires more information all around.

Moreover, it is possible to realize a graphical representation about the target inspection time for each bundle; Fig. 7 shows the inspection time for the bundle HE-115-T2.

It was demonstrated that one of the most useful models in engineering reliability is the Weibull due to its close relationship with the process modeled. Considering this fact, a methodology based on the obtained results was proposed. Results suggest that the proposed method represents a reliable option to be applied when any single or mixture of following conditions apply: there is uncertainty, samples about the installed components are small, only censored times to failure are used. In addition, this method allows including expert knowledge about the process. Moreover, the theory behind this model can be extended to any probabilistic model. 6. Conclusions
Generally, in the process of testing an installed component, the data obtained cannot be recorded precisely and then the failure times are not observable. As a result, only censored data is acquired for the samples; the maximum likelihood method is not applicable, which introduces a high uncertainty degree in this problem, we proposed a methodology based on fuzzy num-bers theory, obtained as a result of fuzzy reliability indices which account for uncertainty.

This methodology proposes establishing the shape parameter from either historical failure data, prior experience or from engineering knowledge of the physics of the failure. Such process is held by considering the relationship between the shape para-meter and the failure mode (bathtub curve) as well as expert opinion. After that, the scale parameter is estimated by means of the estimator proposed by Abernethy (2008) .

Although Nelson (1985) provided methods for determining con fi dence bounds when failures are present, this is not applicable when the sample contains only censored data. Our proposed method overcomes that limitation by estimating an interval of a crisp value, thus posing to be a great advantage over other methods.

In practice, we found that the fuzzy reliability and fuzzy failure probability obtained, contained the punctual value estimated by means of the classical method. The fuzzy parameters in the
Weibull model had to be estimated by considering previous knowledge because the sample had only censored data; however, it computed a fi rst approximation of the shape parameter. More-over, the fuzzy reliability estimation obtained a range of possible values for each interval of time.

The application was tested using data from petroleum installa-tion plants which generally do not have enough information to alpha make an inspection plan. In those cases, they estimate the Weibull parameters by using expert opinions or MTTF. Therefore, knowing that in engineering reliability the parameters of Weibull model the model by using fuzzy numbers represented by means of triangular functions instead of the mere classical method.
Another advantage of the fuzzy reliability estimation is that it always obtains a range of possible values for an interval of time, reliability by means of conventional methods because these do not account for the uncertainty involved, thus, representing greater risks when taking decisions about maintenance frequency.
The component replacement proposed in this work is only for non-repairable systems; however, this methodology could be total number of certain events that appear at random time instants; during the interval  X  0 ; t , then, for each fi a random variable, and a family of random variables f Nt  X  X  0 o t o 1g is termed as counting random process. One important the number of events in an interval of length t has a Poisson the Poisson process has a Gamma distribution ( Gertsbakh, 2000 ).
In this context, the parameter of the Poisson distribution could be constructed by experience using the triangular fuzzy number  X   X  X  a = b = c , since it represents the mean of the number to establish the Gamma parameters as fuzzy numbers, it is necessary to determine the relationship between the real system and these parameters. Such challenge is left as future work.
A practical application of the proposed model has been discussed and demonstrated. It involved planning an inspection frequency based on a certain fuzzy reliability and considering component risk measured in fi nancial terms. The results obtained allow concluding that the methodology proposed represents a easier to implement and obtain reliable estimations by using this kind of data. As a fi nal conclusion, the method presented here represents a reliable and solid option for reliability engineering. References
