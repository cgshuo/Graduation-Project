Scheduling and planning problems are ubiquitous in many real-world settings. These problems transpire in a large variety of forms, and have enormous socio-economic impact. For many years, significant work has been devoted to automating scheduling and planning processes using different kinds of methods. Among them, local search algorithms have been shown to be very promising.
A local search algorithm typically starts with a feasible solution to the problem at hand, and repeatedly makes small changes within an appropriately defined neighbourhood of the given solu-tion in an attempt to improve the solution quality over time. One of the major limitations of this, however, is that it can get stuck in local optima. Increasing the neighbourhood size used in the local search algorithm or restarting the algorithm would help for problem instances of small to medium sizes. When it comes to large real-world problem instances, the potentially huge number of local optima makes these conventional ways of overcoming local optimality rather time-consuming and inefficient. As a result, many generally applicable extensions of local search algorithms  X  the metaheuristic algorithms  X  have been proposed in the litera-ture over the last two decades.
 The special section on  X  X  X ocal Search Algorithms for Real-World
Scheduling and Planning X  X  showcases the use of these extended local search algorithms for different scheduling and planning problems, with a particular focus on (1) experimental research based on real-world data and (2) industrial case studies. Six papers out of the 26 submissions received have been included, represent-ing an acceptance rate of 23%. Each of the accepted papers was rigorously reviewed in two to three rounds by anonymous referees.
The authors of these papers have demonstrated how a range of real-world scheduling and planning problems can be successfully solved by hybridising local search with advanced metaheuristics.
In the first paper by Zhang and Wu , a two-stage approach based on the probabilistic model-building genetic algorithm (also known as Estimation Distribution Algorithms) and a local search proce-dure for parameter perturbation is proposed to solve a real-world job shop scheduling problem with batch-wise pending due dates.
As the name suggests, the problem considered by Zhang and Wu differs from the standard job shop scheduling problem in two aspects: the pending due dates and the influence of job batches have been taken into account. The problem instances used for this work are provided by a large-scale speed-reducer manufacturing enterprise located in Shanxi, China. Numerical experiments com-paring the results obtained by the proposed algorithm to a genetic algorithm integrated with an iterated local search and a hybrid algorithm combining Tabu search and Simulated Annealing show that Zhang and Wu X  X  two-stage algorithm can perform significantly better than the other two approaches.

Following which, the paper by Wauters et al. presents an integrated approach to real-world production scheduling for the food processing industry. Scheduling tasks in this industry are non-trivial, and are often complicated by certain requirements such as the diversity of products with different tastes, packaging, custom labels and so on, or the need to deal with the physical routes between work centres in the plant layout. To address these, Wauters et al. decompose the scheduling tasks into several sub-tasks or steps that can be performed by different compo-nents. They first model the scheduling problem as a very general resource-constrained project scheduling problem with general-ised precedence relations. Each local decision step (e.g., choosing a route in the plant layout) is then modelled as a separate module interconnected in a feedback loop. Using local search strategies, new and better decisions can be explored for every module. In addition, data mining techniques have been applied to historical data in order to feed the scheduling process with realistic back-ground knowledge on the key performance indicators (e.g., processing time, set-up time, breakdowns, etc). The presented approach is shown to be able to improve the scheduling process in terms of both speed and quality as compared to the manual practice commonly used in production companies.
 Next in the line, Guimar ~ aes et al. introduce a new variant of Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) to tackle a real-world production planning problem in the beverage industry, a sub-sector of the food industry. The problem considered consists of assigning and scheduling production lots in a multi-plant envir-onment, where each plant has a set of filling lines which bottle and pack (beer and soft) drinks. The planning process also considers final product transfers between the plants. A case study based on a Portuguese beverage company has been carried out, where the aim is to create the annual production budget for the company. Guimar ~ aes et al. first use the VNS variant to guide the process of assigning different families of products to the filling lines. Subsequently, decisions on production, inventory and transfers are obtained through a Linear Programming (LP) model. Due to the large search space involved, the information produced via the sensitivity analysis of the LP model is used to guide the local search process. Dual re-optimisation is also used to speed-up the solution procedure. Numerical tests based on real-world data from the case study confirm the superiority of the proposed new VNS variant over state-of-the-art commercial solvers as well as other VNS variants. Besides that, Guimar ~ aes et al. also show that the proposed algorithm can substantially improve the cur-rent business practice with its potential cost saving capacity.
In the following paper, Papa et al. investigate the use of specialised local search algorithms for a real-world production planning problem. The problem, which can be formulated as a job shop scheduling problem, was introduced while they were designing the application for planning and monitoring of the production process for the ETA Cerkno Company in Slovenia. The company manufactures electric heating and control elements such as hot plates and thermostats. Being a real-world industrial case, there are many specific requirements and constraints to be considered. Papa et al. use two evolutionary techniques  X  a genetic algorithm and a parameter-less evolutionary search  X  and a random search algorithm to guide the local search process.
Through simple restarting mechanisms, they demonstrate that the guided local search algorithms can greatly improve the quality of the production plans in respect to the expert X  X  manual solution. The evolutionary techniques in particular have obtained better results than the random search algorithm. A real-world software implementation for the production planning of the company is also presented.

The penultimate paper by Chica et al. presents three multi-objective approaches to solve the time and space assembly line balancing problem based on the Nissan Pathfinder engine man-ufacturing process of the industrial plant in Barcelona, Spain.
Here, the problem considered differs from the standard assembly line balancing problem in that three conflicting objectives need to be dealt with: the cycle time of the assembly line, the number of the workstations, and the area of these workstations. Due to the multi-criteria nature of the problem, Chica et al. hybridise a multi-criteria local search procedure with three different metaheuristics  X  an Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) algorithm, a Greedy Randomised Search Procedure (GRASP) and a Multi-
Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA). Several variants of these algorithms have been developed and the performance is compared using nine well-known benchmark instances as well as the real-world problem instance from the Nissan plant in Barce-lona. The MOEA-based approach is shown to be the best among the three, whereas ACO-and GRASP-based approaches have performed differently depending on the problem instances.
So far, the papers included have been dominated by problems in industrial production. The last paper by Garc X   X  a-Nieto et al. addresses a different type of problem  X  the scheduling of traffic lights. Traffic light scheduling and vehicular traffic management have received a great deal of attention in civil engineering. However, optimisation approaches have not been used widely in this domain. In their work, Garc X   X  a-Nieto et al. use the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm with a microscopic traffic simulator to find successful cycle programs of traffic lights. Simulation experiments based on two extensive traffic networks located in the metropolitan areas of the cities of Ma  X  laga and Sevilla in Spain have been carried out, and the results are analysed under different road conditions. In com-parison with cycle programs pre-defined by experts, the proposed
PSO algorithm is able to obtain significantly better solutions in terms of the number of vehicles that reach their destinations and the mean trip time.
