 1. INTRODUCTION Named entities (NEs) are essential components of texts, especially news texts. NE extraction and translation are vital in th e field of NLP for research on machine persons (PER), and locations (LOC)), tem poral expressions (dates and times), and number expressions (monetary values and percentages ). Because expressions and number expressions are more regular than entity name s, they can generally be described by ________________________________________________________________________ In this article, we focus on extracting bilingual pairs of entity names. 1 unfamiliar personal names, place names, and names of organi zations. Specifically, personal names are almost always translite rated, where words are usually decomposed pair (Ada,  X  X  X   X  X i Ta X ), the alignments of the TU matching pairs are  X  X -ai, X   X  X -t, X  and  X  X -a. X  Transformation of location names and organization names between two languages in the NE pairs (Little Smoky River,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ) and (Carnegie Mellon University,  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ),  X  X ittle, X   X  X iver, X  and  X  X niversity X  are translated as  X   X  , X   X   X  , X  and  X   X   X  , X  respectively, and  X  X moky, X   X  X arnegie,  X  and  X  X ellon X  are transliterated as  X   X  X  X  (Ssu Mo Chi), X   X   X  X  X  X  (Ka Nei Chi), X  and  X   X  X  X  (Mai Lung), X  respectively. There are compared with (Little Smoky River,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ),  X  X moky X  (Great Smoky Mountains,  X  X  X  X  X  X  ) is translated as  X   X  , X  not transliterated as  X   X  X  X  . X  Moreover, word order is not preserved when transforming names of organizations, as in (University of California,  X  X  X  X  X  ), where  X   X  X   X  and  X   X  X  X   X  are translations of  X  X niversity X  and  X  X alifornia, X  respectively. From the above observations, it is obviously advantageous to combine phrase translation and transliteration while extracting or translating NEs. from bilingual documents. Currently, English NE identifiers are well established and are already being used in commercial products such as BBN X  X  IdentiFinder [Bikel et al. Chinese word segmentation [Chen and Liu 1992; Chien et al. 1999]. To achieve the goal of extracting bilingual NEs from parallel corpora, we introduce a new approach that aims equivalents from the aligned sentence by integrating a phrase translation model, a transliteration model, and extra language-speci fic sources [Lee et al. 2004a; 2004b]. For a given English NE identified in the source sentence, we extract at runtime NE pairs from aligned sentences, as follows: A formal description of the proposed approach is given in Section 3. from parallel corpora. The experimental setup and a quantitative assessment of the performance enhancement are presented in Section 4. Concluding remarks and future research directions are given in Section 5. 2. RELATED WORK have received much attention recently. One appr oach is to mine translation pairs from the 2004; Zhang and Vines 2004]. Most focused on crawling large numbers of web pages to gather sufficient statistics, and hence required more computer disk space (for storing and pairs from bilingual corpora; relevant studies on this topic are described next. Black and Vasilakopoulos 2002; Carreras et al. 2002; Wu et al. 2002; Zhou and Su 2002; Sun et al. 2003], little work has been reported on NE translation. Machine transliteration plays an important role in NE translation; it is done in order to convert a proper noun in the source NE into an approximate phonetic equivalent in the target language. During the past few years, machine transliteration has been studied by numerous researchers working with various language pairs, includ ing English/Arabic [Stalls and Knight 1998]; English/Chinese [Chen et al. 1998b; Wan and Verspoor 1998; Lin and Chen 2002; Lee and Chang 2003; Lee et al. 2003; English/Japanese [Knight and Graehl 1998; Tsuji 2002]; and English/Korean [Lee and Choi 1997; Oh and Choi 2002]. Unlike previous studies, we propose a method that does not require a pronunciation dictionary for converting source words into phonetic symbols nor manually assigned phonetic similarity scores between bilingual name pairs [Lee and Chang 2003]. Our proposed method is the goal of extracting NE pairs cannot be achieved via transliteration alone. As mentioned by Moore [2003], two different strategies, asymmetry and symmetry, can be applied to deal with the mapping problem. The asymmetric strategy assumes that NEs languages and then to establish the associations between NE pairs. Obviously, the symmetric approach is more difficult to apply, since it requires that NEs be identified in both languages. Moreover, the errors and inconsistency induced by NE identification are, Kumano et al. [2004]; while studies based on the asymmetric strategy include Al-[2004]. et al. [2003] investigated formulation and transformation rules for English-Chinese NEs. keywords from phrase-aligned corpora. The study focused on constructing transformation rules for NE mapping between languages; but the NE alignment was not adequately pairs from a parallel corpus, based on a linear combination of translite ration, translation, and tagging costs. Kumano et al. [2004] proposed a method for acquiring English-appearance in each document. However, the methods proposed by both Huang et al. [2003] and Kumano et al. [2004] require that NEs on both sides be identified beforehand, which is not suitable for our task, since we only identify NEs on the source side. following. Al-Onaizan and Knight [2002] proposed an algorithm for translating NEs from Arabic to English using monolingual and bilingual resources. Given an Arabic NE, they use transliteration models (including phonetic-based and a spelling-based models), a bilingual dictionary, and an English news corpus to generate a list of English candidates. accuracy in their experiment left much to be desired. Moore [2003] suggested an approach for choosing English-French NE pairs in parallel corpora based on a sequence English/Chinese. In our previous work [Lee et al. 2004a], we proposed an approach that from parallel corpora. The parameters of these models are automatically estimated using the EM training algorithm in an unsupervised manner. This approach can be further improved by incorporating language-specific knowledge sources [Lee et al. 2004b], maximum entropy model is used that integr ates the translation, transliteration, co-supervised learning approach with a bootstrapping strategy. framework for aligning bilingual NEs in parallel corpora by incorporating proposed statistical models, i.e., a phrase translati on model and a transliteration model, along with multiple knowledge sources, including handling abbreviations, recognizing personal be propagated by NE identifiers in both the source and target languages, we only require that NEs be identified on the source side. 3. BILINGUAL NE ALIGNMENT statistical MT approaches like that of Brown et al. [1993], which mainly focus on aligning words in parallel corpora, cannot achieve the goal of NE alignment due to their inability to handle many-to-many alignment within bilingual NE phrases. To align NE pairs, we adopt a many-to-many word alignment scheme based on statistical models and word segmentation by using an asymmetric ap proach to align English-Chinese NE pairs. 3.1 Problem Statement We aim to return a list of English-Chinese NE pairs automatically extracted from parallel part, we focus on aligning an English NE (w hich was automatically or manually labeled) with its Chinese equivalent in the aligned se ntence. A formal statem ent of the problem is given below. such that { f* } is likely to contain the translation equivalent f of e . (SPTM) Section 3.3; a transliteration mode l (TM) Section 3.4; and other language-handling (AH) Section 3.5; Chinese personal name recognition (CPNR) Section 3.6; and acronym expansion (AE) Section 3.7. The framework, which incorporates SPTM, TM, AH, CPNR, and AE to extract NE pairs from parallel corpora, is presented in Section 3.8. 3.2 Outline of the Proposed Approach We attempt to align source NEs with their translation equivalents in parallel corpora. The following steps are performed in the NE alignment process: decomposing ) | ( e f Score into a lexical translation score function, ) | ( e f Score position alignment score function, ) | ( e f Score Translating NEs also involves transliteration, es pecially in the case of personal names, so following sections, we will formally explain how the phrase translation and transliteration align NE pairs in parallel corpora. 3.3 Statistical Phrase Translation Model (SPTM) In the noisy channel approach to machine translation proposed by Brown et al. [1993], a Following Brown et al. [1993], we model the probability of translating an English phrase probability (LTP) function, ) | ( P ( a | l , m ). follows: most probable translation f* , instead of summing all possible alignments a . Thus Eq. (2) can be expressed as alignment, P ( a i | i , l , m ). Therefore, we have For example, consider the case where the source phrase e =  X  X chthyosis Concern Association X  and its translation equivalent f =  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  . X  In this case, reasonable word segmentations for f are  X   X  X  X  , X   X   X  X  X  X  , X  and  X   X  X  X  . X  The correct as regarding the score function as a log probability function: Accordingly, ) | ( e f Score deletion operation in the transf ormation of the NE pair (Eas t Coast National Scenic Area,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ), as shown in Figure 1. To tackle the insertion and deletion issues apply the method proposed by Damerau [1964] to approximate ) | ( e f Score below. where operation at the word level. To estimate the parameters LTP and PAP of the SPTM model, an EM algorithm for bilingual dictionary and parallel corpora as the training data for learning SPTM. First, we make some initial estimates, like using a uniform segmentation scheme. Then, we details about the process of estimating parameters can be found in Chang et al. [2001]. In relevant bilingual corpora has also been developed [Wu and Chang 2004]. translation candidate where (|) dictionary, an NE-pair list, and a domai n-relevant corpus, respectively, and  X  are weighting factors to be determined empirically. strategy: where (|, ) dictionary, an NE-pair list, and a domai n-relevant corpus, respectively, and  X  are weighting factors to be determined empirically. 3.4 Transliteration Model (TM) Each noun in the phrase being translated may be either a common noun or a proper noun. Proper nouns, especially personal names, are typically transliterated into phonetic we apply machine transliteration to estimate LTP. Since Chinese and English are sounds between them, one possible solution is to adopt a Chinese romanization system to and a romanized Chinese char acter sequence, respectively. One can consider machine into transliteration units (TUs). A TU is de fined as a sequence of characters transliterated as a group [Lee and Chang 2003; Lee et al. 2006]. For instance, Figure 2 shows the TU approximation scheme is given below. A word E with l characters and a romanized word F with m characters are denoted by E 1 E sequence of matched n TUs {( u 1 , v 1 ), ( u 2 , v 2 ), ... ( u n , v n )}: Hence, the alignment a between E and F can be represented as a match type sequence ( m 1 m as follows: derived as follows: approximated as transliteration score function for F , given E , as transliterated during the process of NE translation. Suppose that there is an entry ) , ( derived bilingual lexicon based on Eq. (4). ) | ( where ) ( threshold, respectively. name list and several Chinese romanization schemes, such as Wade-Giles and Hanyu Pinyin, are applied to train the STM. For more details about the learning process, please refer to Lee et al. [2006]. 3.5 Abbreviation Handling (AH) In practice, the transformation of NEs from English to Chinese is more complicated than the transformation process mentioned above. An English NE phrase will usually have Commercial Bank of China X  can be translated  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  , X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  , X  or  X   X  X  X  X  X  . X  We can simply measure the similarity between two Chinese NE candidates when estimating the phrase translation probability. For example, a high probabilistic value for P ( X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  |  X  X nternational Commercial Bank of China X ) and a high similarity measure between  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  and  X   X  X  X  X  X   X  imply that we should also give a high probabilistic value for P ( X   X  X  X  X  X   X  |  X  X nternational Commercial Bank of China X ). Therefore, we can enhance the lexical score function by using follows: characters between China,  X  X  X  X  X  ) with one deletion and two approximate matching operations. 3.6 Chinese Personal Name Recognition (CPNR) language-dependent features, such as CPNR, can be introduced to improve performance. The following example is taken from the magazine Sinorama [Sinorama 2002]: In (S1), there are seven labeled bilingual pa irs of entity names. Among them, (King-yuh Chang,  X  X  X  X  ), (Wang Chi,  X  X  ), and (Gypsy Chang,  X  X  X  X  ) are personal names. In this example, (King-yuh Chang,  X  X  X  X  ) and (Wang Chi,  X  X  ) are well aligned via the method mentioned above. However, in (Gypsy Chang,  X  X  X  X  ),  X  X ypsy X  is an English name that does not have any direct relationship with  X   X  X  X  , X  a traditional Chinese name. To deal with the mapping between a foreign na me and a Chinese name in parallel corpora, we apply CPNR to extract the Chinese part of the PER-typed NE. surnames and given names are composed of one or two characters. Our CPNR model is automatically trained from a large personal name corpus consisting of one million entries. We use Chinese surnames as anchor points and then determine whether the following one or two characters is a Chinese given name or not. Suppose that Chinese characters. The decision function defined as follows: the two-character given name, and the second character of the two-character given name, respectively, and Thr 2 and Thr 3 are constants. where 1 GN is the one-character given name and Thr 4 is a constant. aligning foreign names with their corresponding Chinese names. Eq. (7) is less than Thr 1 . Then, given a named person, the transliteration score function is reformulated as 3.7 Acronym Expansion (AE) Acronyms carry significant information in co rpora. However, they are frequently created pairs in corpora. To acquire acronym-translation pairs, a two-stage approach is proposed in this article. In the first stage, in which an acronym-expansion list is compiled, a simple applied to extract the translation of the expa nsion from the aligned target sentence. This expansion typically appear within a sentence in a specific pattern, which usually occurs in one of the following two canonical forms: subsequent bilingual NE extraction.

For the sake of clarity, the NEs in Table II are underlined. information [Chuang et al. 2002] is applied to align parallel texts at the sentence level. In the words themselves, and previously predicted NE tags, is applied to approximately corrected. A general overview of NE recognition systems adopted in the NE recognition shared task of CoNLL-2003 can be found in Sang and Meulder [2003]. Many studies have focused on identifying monolingual NEs, especially in English. In this study, however, our focus is the alignment of bilingual NEs. In the following, we further clarify the main process by means of illustrative examples. acronym-expansion table, as shown in Tabl e I. For instance, in example (1) in Table II, Acronym Text Expansion

Therefore, af ter applying SPTM and AH, we find that the set { f 1 } of  X  X LA X  can extract the NE pair (CLA,  X  X  X  X  ) by choosing the top-1 ranking of the candidates in { f }. Note that  X   X  X  X  X   X  is an abbreviation of  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  , X  which is a translation equivalent of  X  X ouncil of Labor Affairs. X  PER-type alignment. Personal names are almo st always transliterated. However, in  X  X my X  in the NE pair (Amy Hung,  X  X  X  X   X  X ung Ying Fen X ). In this example,  X  X ung X  is a Chinese last name and can be translated as  X   X  , X  which forms { f 1 }. But  X  X my X  is a sentence. The goal of the next step is to fi nd the association between a foreign name and a Chinese name. Therefore, in Step (II.2), CPNR is activated by  X  X my, X  and the Chinese given name  X   X  X  X   X  is then detected by CPNR, forming { f 2 }. Thus, the pair (Amy Hung,  X  X  X  X  ) is successfully detected by merging { f one requires a lot of effort. Moreover, two NE identifiers do not always extract NE pairs consistently, especially when one of the NE id entifiers is not as capable as the other one. For example, the Chinese NE identifier is cu rrently not well developed because there are framework proposed here, on the other hand, only needs a reliable English NE identifier together with the models associated with mu ltiple knowledge sources to extract NE pairs. Experimental results show that our appro ach can achieve excellent performance for bilingual NE alignment; more details on th e experiments are reported in Section 4. 4. EXPERIMENTS approach to bilingual NE alignment in parallel corpora. 4.1 Experimental Setup Several corpora were collected to estimate th e parameters of the proposed models. Noun phrases from the BDC Electronic Chinese-English Dictionary [BDC 1992] were used to name corpus compiled by the Central News Agency [CNA 2003] and Britannica Concise Encyclopedia [BCE 2003], respectively, were used to train an NE-specific SPTM. A list of NE pairs collected from Sinorama magazine was used to train a domain-relevant transliterations [Huai 1989] and Chinese roma nization tables were used. To train CPNR, a Chinese personal name corpus containing one million Chinese personal names was used. Example Bilingual Sentences Bilingual NE Pairs (1) According to statistics of the CLA , nearly 30,000 (2)  X  X isas are hard to come by, X  says Amy Hung , who Sinorama . level: To analyze the performance of the proposed methods for NE alignment, we randomly lengths of English NEs to be less than 6 words. In total, 1,432 pairs of NEs were labeled. The numbers of NE pairs for types PER, LOC, and ORG were 380, 522, and 530, respectively. Table IV shows the statistics for the bilingual NE pairs. 4.2 Experimental Results and Discussion Several experiments were subsequently conducted to analyze the performance enhancement achieved with the proposed methods. Moreover, for the purpose of comparison with established baselines, we evaluated NE alignment against IBM Model 4 available implementation of the IBM models. Experimental results here are based on the evaluation criterion mentioned above, as shown in Table V. From the above data, we can observe the following facts: Table VI. Average Lengths of the NE Types for the Answer Set in the Sinorama Test Set More specifically, Table VII shows some ex amples that demonstrate the performance enhancement achieved by adding more knowledge sources. For simplicity, we focus only on the underlined NEs proposed methods for NE alignment, we randomly selected 400 aligned sentences from HKNPT and manually labeled the answer keys. In total, 893 pairs of NEs were labeled. The numbers of NE pairs for types PER, LOC, and ORG are 168, 348, and 377, respectively. Tables VIII and IX show the rele vant statistics of these bilingual NE pairs. Table VII. Examples of Possible Chinese NEs Extracted via the Proposed Approach

The performance of the proposed approach is significantly better than the IBM Model 4 on PER-type NEs and competes with IBM Model 4 on LOC-type and ORG-type NEs. pairs were not, as shown in Table XI. For simplicity, only erroneously aligned NE pairs are underlined in the table; these errors are explained as follows: 
Examp le Comparisons between Sinorama and HKNPT in terms of the performance achieved using language-specific knowledge sources, including SPTM, TM, AE, AH, and CPNR, are shown in Table XII. Detailed statistics on the number of translations and transliterations in two test corpora are given in Table XIII. Table XII. Performance for Each Language-S pecific Knowledge Source in Two Corpora Table XIII. Detailed Statistics on Numbers of Translations and Transliterations in Two trained with a general dictionary, a list of NE pairs, and the Sinorama corpus. Thus, the lexicon, especially for the proper names of LOC-type and ORG-type NEs, does not cover many word translations in HKNPT. For LO C-type NEs, some examples not aligned correctly in HKNPT are sh own as follows: (Lantau,  X  X  X  X  ), (Castle Peak,  X  X  X  ), (Stanley,  X  X  X  ), (Repulse Bay,  X  X  X  X  ), (Queensway,  X  X  X  X  ), and (Trio,  X  X  X  X  ). As for the ORG-type NEs, some erroneous examples were given, as follows: (Marine and Land Enforcement Command,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ), (Treasury,  X  X  X  X  ), (Geotechnical Engineering Office,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ), (Department of Justice,  X  X  X  X  ), (Arch SD,  X  X  X  X  ), and (Correctional Services Department,  X  X  X  X  ). However, these problems can be alleviated by adding a small gazetteer of well-known names or by automatically learning showing the difficulties encountered in the HK NPT test are shown as follows: (Mauritian,  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X ao Li Chiu Ssu X ), (Robert Ribeiro,  X  X  X   X  X i I X ), (Tony Blair,  X  X  X  X   X  X ei Lieh Mak,  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X ai Lieh Fei Fei X ). None of these cases can be solved via transliteration or CPNR. We also noticed that the performance of the IBM Model 4 in the HKNPT test was much better than in the Sinorama test. One possible reason may be the sentences, which is much less than that of the HKNPT corpus, in which 600,000 aligned sentences were used. achieved significant improvement in NE alignment on different test data. We believe that the proposed framework, achieved by integrating various language functions, can be further improved through the use of more refined models and language-specified functions. The proposed SPTM can be refined by introducing additional linguistic information . More specifically, we can train more and finer parameters for SPTM models we have sufficient training data, we can train SPTM constrained by NE keywords --for example, the translation  X   X   X  for  X  X epartment X  almost always appears in the last position in Chinese ORG-type NEs. As for CPNR, we can enhance detection of Chinese surnames by considering composite surnames that ar e composed of two one-character surnames information of PER-typed NEs, e.g., given the source NE  X  X my Hung X  with two candidate names  X   X  X  X  X  (Hung, Ying-Fen) X  and  X   X  X  X  X  (Hung, Chun-Chieh), X  it is obvious that  X   X  X  X  X   X  should be selected since it is a female name. Contextual information such as personal titles and speech-act verbs can also be used to improve the NE alignment by analyzing the contextu al structures of aligned sentences. the lack of large parallel corpora. A potentially effective way to alleviate this problem is to develop algorithms for automatically extracting parallel corpora from the web [Nie et corpora from the Web will benefit the efficient development of bilingual text processing tools using parallel corpora. Several experiments were conducted to de monstrate the better performance of the proposed methods when confronted with various types of NEs. We used AH to measure highly effective, since Chinese ORG-type NEs frequently appear in abbreviated form. CPNR was applied to enhance the association between pairs of PER-type NEs, especially for foreign names and their corresponding Chinese names. We have successfully expanded an English acronym via AE and aligned the expansion with its translation, which is a very effective approach to aligning ORG-type NEs. All of the proposed experiments. As a consequence, by combining all the proposed knowledge sources, the average rate could be improved from 84.99% to 91.13% for Sinorama and from 62.82% to 80.18% for HKNPT. 5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK As the need to acquire bilingual NE pairs continues to grow, we present a new approach statistical models for phrase translation and transliteration for the alignment of bilingual NEs in parallel corpora. Moreover, we incorp orated multiple knowledge sources based on abbreviation handling, Chinese person name recognition, and acronym expansion to form a complete framework for bilingual NE alignment in parallel corpora. proposed a novel approach that can effectiv ely handle many-to-many alignment within bilingual NE phrases. Second, the proposed approach is mainly implemented through sufficient training data. Third, the proposed framework achieves significant improvement in NE alignment by incorporating extra know ledge sources. Finally, experimental results also show that our integrated approach outperforms the base line approach as well as the traditional IBM Model 4 approach when applied to corpora of various subject domains. by using more dictionaries for domain-specific NEs and common names.
