 Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is an important task for location based service (LBS) providers. Generally, an LBS provider can employ collaborative filtering (CF) to recommend a set of POIs to a target user, given that this user has shared a sufficient number of check-in experiences with the LBS provider. However, this requirement typically cannot be met in practice, which results in the notorious cold start problem that is common in CF based recommender systems. To tackle this problem, a wide variety of social recommendation ap-proaches have appeared in the literature. The motive of social recommendation is the explicit social relations among users could be used as a data source to cal-culate user similarities. Recent studi es have shown that social recommendation outperforms non-social approaches in many application domains [3].
In practice, social relations among users (a.k.a. social graph G ) is typically owned by a social networking service (SNS) provider such as Facebook or Twit-ter. As pointed in [2], this proprietary social graph is an important asset with inestimable value, thus should be kept secret for obvious reasons of commer-cial benefits, as well as due to privacy legislation. For the same reason, an LBS provider must keep user check-in data (e.g., the user-POI matrix M ) secret. Therefore, we face a challenging scenar io where two parties (SNS provider and LBS provider) wish to jointly conduct POI recommendation, without revealing their private data (i.e., G and M )toeachother.

In this paper, we present PPS-POI-Rec, a novel privacy preserving social POI recommender system that enables SNS provider and LBS provider to coopera-tively recommend a set of POIs to a target user while keeping their private data secret. Clearly, the core challenge in implementing PPS-POI-Rec is to achieve privacy preserving. Towards this goal, S NS provider adopts Paillier cryptosystem [4] to encrypt user social similarity derived from her private data M ,andLBS provider computes the sco res of recommending POIs to users on the encrypted social similarities. To find top-K POIs with encrypted scores, SNS provider and LBS provider follow a secure top-k select ion protocol building on Yao X  X  protocol [5] (a.k.a. Yao X  X  Garbled Circuits, or YGC for short). In this demonstration, we will show step by step SNS provider and LBS provider are able to recommend a set of POIs to a target user, without revealing their private data to each other. As shown in Fig. 1, our recommender system PPS-POI-Rec has two layers: mobile client layer and server layer. In mobile client layer, users are offered with several LBSs, including check-in sh aring, trajectory recording in different temporal granularities, such as in day or in week, and POI recommendation. The server layer consists of two parties LBS provider and SNS provider. Each party has several components and their functionalities are described as follows. Data col lector: Both LBS provider and SNS provider have a data collector. This component is used to collect data genera ted by users. Specifically, LBS provider collects the check-in data submitted by users via their mobile devices, and store them in a MySQL database. SNS provider collects the social relations among users and store them in a Neo4j database.
 Encryption Component: Both LBS provider and SNS provider has an encryp-tion component, which is in charge of k eeping their private data secret during POI recommendation. Paillier cryptosystem are used for data encryption. SNS provider generates a public key and a secret key, and sends the public key to LBS provider for later computation. As a YGC constructor, LBS provider prepares a Yao X  X  garbled circuit and sends it to SNS provider who is a YGC evaluator. This garbled circuit is the key compone nt in secure top-k selection, which is a kind of secure two-party computation.
 Notifier and Social Similarity Manager: The notifier of LBS provider is respon-sible for pushing the recommendation result, that is, top-k POIs, to users. The social similarity manager of SNS provider calculates user similarities based on some pre-defined social similarity measures such as common neighbors (CN), Katz, and random walk with restart (RWR), just to name a few.
 System Implementation: The mobile client layer is implemented as an an-droid application based on Android SDK 4.3 and Baidu Map API. The server layer is implemented based on Hibernate and is deployed on Tomcat 7. For Pail-lier cryptosystem, we use a public available Java implementation 1 . Besides, we implement Yao X  X  garbled circuits based on FasterGC [1].
 During the demonstration, the audience could act as users and download our app in http://ada.suda.edu.cn:8080/adalab new/apk.html. After installation, they can log in the app by creating a new a ccount or using an existing account (e.g., username  X  X da X  and password  X 1111 X ). As depicted in Fig. 2, they can interact with our recommender system by c hecking in places of their interest (Fig. 2). Then, LBS provider and SNS provider jointly compute the recommen-dation result in a privacy preserving manner. Finally, LBS provider recommends top-k ( k = 5 in the demonstration) POIs to users, as shown in Fig. 3. For demon-stration purpose, SNS provider has stored a social graph containing 1,892 users in an Neo4j database (see Fig. 4). Besides, LBS provider has stored a POI dataset of Suzhou containing 193,791 POIs, and a real check-in dataset in a MySQL database (see Fig. 5).
