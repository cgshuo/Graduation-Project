 Recommender system is an indispensable tool used to produce item recommendations presented by the explicit scores provided by users, or these implicit feedbacks inferred from users X  behaviors [3]. We refer to all types of interactions as ratings. The ratings expressed by users on items are stored in a rating matrix, which is usually extremely content based filtering versus collaborative filtering (CF). The former methods require gathering content information that might not be easy to collect. The latter only rely on users X  historical records [10]. The CF methods are further adopted into two directions: the nearest neighbor based method and the latent factor model. The latter gains much [3], [8], [11] have been proposed to improve the prediction accuracy. In order to take full advantages of these two strategies, the task on combining these CF approaches has been studied recently. Exis ting research can be classified into the approaches[2], [5]; (2) factorizing the neighborhood to directly model neighbors, e.g., a factorized neighborhood method [4] is presented; (3) making use of external data to users and items are not independent of each other in the real world. The latent factors factors rather than the individual user and item factor. the collaborative factors and then elaborate our proposed model. The performances of our approach is reported in Section 3. Finally, we draw some conclusions and discuss the future work in Section 4. factors and collaborative item factors are na med together as collaborative factors:  X  are constants to determine weights between individual factor and collaborative factors. leading to a novel formulation represented as: 
This model is referred to as the Collaborative Matrix Factorization (CoMF), and it is utilized to better infer the latent features of users and items. Learning Algorithm. To find the optimization of the CoMF, we perform the minimization problem on the sum of squared error between the actual observed ratings and their predicted values. The objective function minimizing the regularized squared error on the set (denoted as S ) of known ratings is then defined as: ratings. The derivations are omitted as they are easy for readers to perform. the result. We further compare our proposed CoMF with the following methods:  X 
UserMean. It utilizes the mean value of other users to predict the missing values.  X 
ItemMean. It applies the mean value of every item to predict the missing values.  X 
Biased SVD. The regularization term is set to 0.05, and the learning rate is 0.005.  X 
SVD++. It is proposed in [4] and regularization is 0.055, and learning rate 0.07.  X 
RSTE. It is proposed in [6] and  X  is set to 0.6 with the regularization term 0.04 and the learning rate is 0.01. 
On the Movielens dataset, the regularization coefficients are set to 0.005and 0.001 
In the CoMF model,  X  and  X  play very important roles. To determine the sensitivity of  X  and  X  , we carried out an experiment where we varied the value of  X  and  X  from Movielens dataset and Epinions dataset as an optimum value. CoMF method significantly outperforms the other methods both on the Movielens and the Epinions dataset. accuracy, and propose a novel collaborative matrix factorization (CoMF) model. 
With the explosive increase of information in the Web, the modalities and types of recommender systems. Therefore, it is important to consider the heterogeneous data to improve performance of recommendations. Meanwhile, scalable methods to address other recommendation tasks, such as the Top-N task, and other performance measures should be considered under this circumstance.
