Given the expanded engine model as shown Fig. 2 , the DRNN m Z h , Z d and Z y , are set to 1 10 7 .

To obtain the engine data for DRNN modelling, two sets of are listed in Table 1 .

The sample time in the simulation was set to 0.1 s. The u  X  k  X  X  where u min and u max are the minimum and maximum inputs the output.
 The mean absolute error (MAE) is used here to evaluate the DRNN modelling performance, its definition is given in the equation: MAE  X  1 n the real engine data and the DRNN output during the model DRNN. 5.2. Control results the whole throttle operating condition.

The AFR is to be controlled between the 7 1% bounds of the function (17) which can be adjusted to achieve stable and N =0, then the MPC of SI engines can be considered as a sub-problem of NLP problems, min upper bound of the control variable _ m fi .
