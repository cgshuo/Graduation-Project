 Nowadays semantic processing of natural languages has became more important and ontologies are important resources in semantic processing of natural languages. They begun [1] and the result was called FarsNet [2].
 Our motivation from mapping FarsNet to SUMO was to extend the ability of Persian language semantic processing by integrating the lexical knowledge of FarsNet and common knowledge of SUMO. SUMO is an influential upper level ontology and has excellent power in description of general concepts in the world. Merging SUMO conjunction with Persian language processing. 
There are two approaches for mapping FarsNet to SUMO but there are difficulties manner and without utilizing any external source. In this approach it is better to make an automatic mapping but it is so complicated and perhaps impossible. Therefore, the only solution in this approach is manual mapping. This kind of mapping is obviously a time consuming process. Accordingly, the first approach is not a good choice. The Second approach is utilizing a third party. Applying lexical resources such as these complications we selected the second approach for our mapping. But we attempted to cover the gaps and avoid from biasing to English language. Hierarchical relations in FarsNet helped us to keep the mapping away from troubles. In this paper we propose our methodology for mapping FarsNet to SUMO via WordNet. We have mappings of some FarsNet synsets to WordNet synsets and on the WordNet as an intermediator. The mapping of FarsNet to WordNet has been created resources that are necessary for producing the mapping such as WordNet, FarsNet and section 4 we analyze our results. We have three important resources that will be introduced in this section. 2.1 Princeton WordNet meronymy, troponymy, etc. 2.2 FarsNet lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge about more than 17000 persian words and phrases organized in about 10000 synsets of nouns, adjectives and verbs [2]. FarsNet has different kinds of relations such as: synonymy, hypernymy and hyponymy, verbs and about %70 of it is mapped to WordNet 3.0. 2.3 SUMO SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology) [6] is an important upper level ontology. SUMO has a MID-Level Ontology (MILO) and some domain ontologies. Altogether they have about 20000 terms and 70000 axioms. SUMO was created at Teknowledge Corporation and owned by IEEE[6]. The Knowledge representation language is a lexical knowledge and global knowledge can benefit from each other. According to our study on mapping FarsNet to PWN and mapping PWN to SUMO, FarsNet synsets can be categorized into different groups of nouns, adjectives categories. 3.1 Adjectives necessary to adopt new techniques for processing each of them: mapped to SUMO straightforwardly via PWN. There is an illustration of this group in table 1. 2. There is a category of FarsNet adjectives that are (or should be) mapped into PWN nouns instead of adjectives. This is one of the interesting differences of the Persian while, they are nouns in PWN. Accordingly, we use mapping of PWN nouns to SUMO for this category. An example of this group is shown in table 2. 2.1. There is a subgroup in the second category. This subgroup makes a large part two languages. So there is no compulsion for mapping this group to PWN. Some examples of this category is illustrated in Table 4.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  :  X  X hender-ghaz X  The property of little  X  X  X   X  X  X  :  X  X hosh -khabar X  Bringing goo d ness , 3.2 Nouns In this section, the method of mapping nouns is explained. We divide them into three categories and handle them differently. There are four kinds of relations between noun groups of nouns: 1. Similar to the first group of adjectives, the first group of nouns became mapped to SUMO via PWN automatically without any problem.(table 5). 
FarsNet and it is possible to find their mapping via these relations automatically. In the following example we show how relations facilitate our method of mapping for some synsets that don X  X  have any mapping to PWN. 
There is a synset for this word in FarsNet. This word is not lexicalized in English hypernym relation with the synset  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  :khishavand, aghvam X , which obtained from hypernymy relation is mapped to a synset of PWN with an equivalence relation and the synset of PWN was mapped to  X  X amilyRelation X  from  X   X  X  X  X  : jari X  to  X  X amilyRelation X  (Figure 1). some of these synsets that there are hierarchical relations for them in FarsNet, we have mapping to PWN but  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  : vajeb, farizeh X  has an Equivalence  X  X eligiousProcess X  concept of SUMO. So it is possible to build a hypernymy father of synset  X   X  X  X  X  X  : fetriyeh X  at FarsNet (Figure 2). 3.3 Verbs Fortunately, many of the verbs in FarsNet have been mapped to PWN and so, antonymy, causes, hypernymy. We use these relations for those verbs that don X  X  have have mapping to PWN. Figure 3 shows an example for mapping of a verb that doesn X  X  meanings of the verbs in figure 3 are explained in the following:  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  : ahan roba kardan X  = magnetize , make magnetic  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  : ahan roba shodan X = to became magnetized methodology are described. 4.1 Mapping Output mapping PWN 3.0 to SUMO [8]. The following example is a record of mapping for a FarsNet synset: 2751 *3453,  X  X  X  X  ,* WordNet:06285090, Sentence= mapped to and the last one is SUMO concept that the PWN synset is mapped to it with a SUMO concept. We used three signs same as [8], for representing the kinds of relations:  X = X  for synonymy,  X + X  for hypernymy and  X  X  X  for instantiation. Moreover we used  X - X  for causes. 
But this is not enough for us. we know that there are some FarsNet synsets that are not mapped to SUMO via PWN. Moreover there is nothing about explanation of (stop) in FarsNet. 4.2 Mapping Rules There are several rules for making relations from FarsNet synsets to SUMO concepts. We introduce them corresponding to the relations that are from FarsNet to PWN and PWN to SUMO. These rules are described in table 6. The second column in the table displays all kinds of relations that there are in FarsNet to WordNet 3.0 mapping. The combining two prior columns. The rule numbers 1, 2, 3 have used in noun, adjective and verb synsets of FarsNet. column and in the seventh till twelfth rows of table have composed from a hypernymy those FarsNet synsets that don X  X  have direct relations to PWN. The first operand of  X + X  noun or verb synsets which don X  X  have mapping to PWN. Number The table can be summarized in the following rules: 
Considering a synset F in FarsNet;  X 
A: If F is mapped to synset P in PWN with relation R1 and P is mapped to concept S in SUMO with relation R2 then there is a relation R3 between F and S in such a way that:  X 
B: otherwise if F is not mapped to PWN but is related to F' by R' and F' is mapped there is a relation R3 mapping F to S in such a way that: 4.3 Mapping Rates concepts that are in the concept columns. There is an interesting observation from the that is mapped by three groups of FarsNet synsets: noun, adjective and verb.
