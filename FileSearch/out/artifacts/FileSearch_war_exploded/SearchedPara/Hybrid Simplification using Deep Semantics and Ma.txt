 Sentence simplification maps a sentence to a sim-pler, more readable one approximating its con-tent. Typically, a simplified sentence differs from a complex one in that it involves simpler, more usual and often shorter, words (e.g., use instead of exploit ); simpler syntactic constructions (e.g., no relative clauses or apposition); and fewer mod-ifiers (e.g., He slept vs. He also slept ). In prac-tice, simplification is thus often modeled using four main operations: splitting a complex sen-tence into several simpler sentences; dropping and reordering phrases or constituents; substituting words/phrases with simpler ones.

As has been argued in previous work, sentence simplification has many potential applications. It is useful as a preprocessing step for a variety of NLP systems such as parsers and machine trans-lation systems (Chandrasekar et al., 1996), sum-marisation (Knight and Marcu, 2000), sentence fusion (Filippova and Strube, 2008) and semantic role labelling (Vickrey and Koller, 2008). It also has wide ranging potential societal application as a reading aid for people with aphasis (Carroll et al., 1999), for low literacy readers (Watanabe et al., 2009) and for non native speakers (Siddharthan, 2002).

There has been much work recently on de-veloping computational frameworks for sentence simplification. Synchronous grammars have been used in combination with linear integer program-ming to generate and rank all possible rewrites of an input sentence (Dras, 1999; Woodsend and La-pata, 2011). Machine Translation systems have been adapted to translate complex sentences into simple ones (Zhu et al., 2010; Wubben et al., 2012; Coster and Kauchak, 2011). And handcrafted rules have been proposed to model the syntactic transformations involved in simplifications (Sid-dharthan et al., 2004; Siddharthan, 2011; Chan-drasekar et al., 1996).

In this paper, we present a hybrid approach to sentence simplification which departs from this previous work in two main ways.

First, it combines a model encoding probabil-ities for splitting and deletion with a monolin-gual machine translation module which handles reordering and substitution. In this way, we ex-ploit the ability of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems to capture phrasal/lexical substi-tution and reordering while relying on a dedi-cated probabilistic module to capture the splitting and deletion operations which are less well (dele-tion) or not at all (splitting) captured by SMT ap-proaches.

Second, our approach is semantic based. While previous simplification approaches starts from ei-ther the input sentence or its parse tree, our model takes as input a deep semantic representation namely, the Discourse Representation Structure (DRS, (Kamp, 1981)) assigned by Boxer (Curran et al., 2007) to the input complex sentence. As we shall see in Section 4, this permits a linguistically principled account of the splitting operation in that semantically shared elements are taken to be the basis for splitting a complex sentence into sev-eral simpler ones; this facilitates completion (the re-creation of the shared element in the split sen-tences); and this provide a natural means to avoid deleting obligatory arguments.

When compared against current state of the art methods (Zhu et al., 2010; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011; Wubben et al., 2012), our model yields sig-nificantly simpler output that is both grammatical and meaning preserving. Earlier work on sentence simplification relied on handcrafted rules to capture syntactic sim-plification e.g., to split coordinated and subor-dinated sentences into several, simpler clauses or to model active/passive transformations (Sid-dharthan, 2002; Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997; Bott et al., 2012; Canning, 2002; Siddharthan, 2011; Siddharthan, 2010). While these hand-crafted approaches can encode precise and linguis-tically well-informed syntactic transformation (us-ing e.g., detailed morphological and syntactic in-formation), they are limited in scope to purely syn-tactic rules and do not account for lexical simpli-fications and their interaction with the sentential context.

Using the parallel dataset formed by Simple En-cused on developing machine learning approaches to sentence simplification.

Zhu et al. (2010) constructed a parallel cor-pus (PWKP) of 108,016/114,924 complex/simple sentences by aligning sentences from EWKP and SWKP and used the resulting bitext to train a sim-plification model inspired by syntax-based ma-chine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001). Their simplification model encodes the probabil-ities for four rewriting operations on the parse tree of an input sentences namely, substitution, re-ordering, splitting and deletion. It is combined with a language model to improve grammatical-ity and the decoder translates sentences into sim-pler ones by greedily selecting the output sentence with highest probability.
 Using both the PWKP corpus developed by Zhu et al. (2010) and the edit history of Simple Wikipedia, Woodsend and Lapata (2011) learn a quasi synchronous grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2006) describing a loose alignment between parse trees of complex and of simple sentences. Fol-lowing Dras (1999), they then generate all possi-ble rewrites for a source tree and use integer lin-ear programming to select the most appropriate simplification. They evaluate their model on the same dataset used by Zhu et al. (2010) namely, an aligned corpus of 100/131 EWKP/SWKP sen-tences and show that they achieve better BLEU score. They also conducted a human evaluation on 64 of the 100 test sentences and showed again a better performance in terms of simplicity, gram-maticality and meaning preservation.

In (Wubben et al., 2012; Coster and Kauchak, 2011), simplification is viewed as a monolingual translation task where the complex sentence is the source and the simpler one is the target. To ac-count for deletions, reordering and substitution, Coster and Kauchak (2011) trained a phrase based machine translation system on the PWKP corpus while modifying the word alignment output by GIZA++ in Moses to allow for null phrasal align-ments. In this way, they allow for phrases to be deleted during translation. No human evaluation is provided but the approach is shown to result in statistically significant improvements over a tradi-tional phrase based approach. Similarly, Wubben et al. (2012) use Moses and the PWKP data to train a phrase based machine translation system aug-mented with a post-hoc reranking procedure de-signed to rank the output based on their dissim-ilarity from the source. A human evaluation on 20 sentences randomly selected from the test data indicates that, in terms of fluency and adequacy, their system is judged to outperform both Zhu et al. (2010) and Woodsend and Lapata (2011) sys-tems. We start by motivating our approach and explain-ing how it relates to previous proposals w.r.t., the four main operations involved in simplifica-tion namely, splitting, deletion, substitution and reordering. We then introduce our framework. Sentence Splitting. Sentence splitting is ar-guably semantic based in that in many cases, split-ting occurs when the same semantic entity partici-pates in two distinct eventualities. For instance, in example (1) below, the split is on the noun bricks which is involved in two eventualities namely,  X  X eing resistant to cold X  and  X  X nabling the con-struction of permanent buildings X  .
While splitting opportunities have a clear coun-terpart in syntax (i.e., splitting often occurs when-ever a relative, a subordinate or an appositive clause occurs in the complex sentence), comple-tion i.e., the reconstruction of the shared element in the second simpler clause, is arguably seman-tically governed in that the reconstructed element corefers with its matching phrase in the first sim-pler clause. While our semantic based approach naturally accounts for this by copying the phrase corresponding to the shared entity in both phrases, syntax based approach such as Zhu et al. (2010) and Woodsend and Lapata (2011) will often fail to appropriately reconstruct the shared phrase and in-troduce agreement mismatches because the align-ment or rules they learn are based on syntax alone. For instance, in example (2), Zhu et al. (2010) fails to copy the shared argument  X  X he judge X  to the second clause whereas Woodsend and Lapata (2011) learns a synchronous rule matching (VP and VP) to (VP. NP(It) VP) thereby failing to pro-duce the correct subject pronoun (  X  X e X  or  X  X he X  ) for the antecedent  X  X he judge X  . Deletion. By handling deletion using a proba-bilistic model trained on semantic representations, we can avoid deleting obligatory arguments. Thus in our approach, semantic subformulae which are related to a predicate by a core thematic roles (e.g., agent and patient ) are never considered for dele-tion. By contrast, syntax based approaches (Zhu et al., 2010; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011) do not distinguish between optional and obligatory argu-ments. For instance Zhu et al. (2010) simplifies (3C) to (3S) thereby incorrectly deleting the oblig-atory theme ( gifts ) of the complex sentence and modifying its meaning to giving knights and war-riors (instead of giving gifts to knights and war-riors ).
We also depart from Coster and Kauchak (2011) who rely on null phrasal alignments for deletion during phrase based machine translation. In their approach, deletion is constrained by the training data and the possible alignments, independent of any linguistic knowledge.
 Substitution and Reordering SMT based ap-proaches to paraphrasing (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) and to sentence simplification (Wubben et al., 2012) have shown that by utilising knowledge about align-ment and translation probabilities, SMT systems can account for the substitutions and the reorder-ings occurring in sentence simplification. Fol-lowing on these approaches, we therefore rely on phrase based SMT to learn substitutions and re-ordering. In addition, the language model we in-tegrate in the SMT module helps ensuring better fluency and grammaticality. 3.1 An Example Figure 1 shows how our approach simplifies (4C) into (4S).
The DRS for (4C) produced using Boxer (Cur-ran et al., 2007) is shown at the top of the Figure between its variables is shown immediately below. Each DRS variable labels a node in the graph and each edge is labelled with the relation holding be-tween the variables labelling its end vertices. The two tables to the right of the picture show the pred-icates (top table) associated with each variable and the relation label (bottom table) associated with each edge. Boxer also outputs the associated po-sitions in the complex sentence for each predicate (not shown in the DRS but in the graph tables). Or-phan words (OW) i.e., words which have no cor-responding material in the DRS (e.g., which at po-sition 16 ), are added to the graph (node O 1 ) thus ensuring that the position set associated with the graph exactly matches the positions in the input sentence and thus deriving the input sentence.
Given the input DRS shown in Figure 1, simpli-fication proceeds as follows.

Splitting. The splitting candidates of a DRS are event pairs contained in that DRS. More precisely, ables associated with at least one of the core the-matic roles (e.g., agent and patient ). The features conditioning a split are the set of thematic roles as-sociated with each event variable. The DRS shown in Figure 1 contains three such event variables X 3 ,X 11 and X 10 with associated thematic role sets { agent, in, in, patient } , { agent, patient } and { agent, for, patient } respectively. Hence, there are 3 splitting candidates ( X 3 -X 11 , X 3 -X 10 and X 10 X 11 ) and 4 split options: no split or split at one of the splitting candidates. Here the split with highest probability (cf. Table 1) is chosen and the DRS is split into two sub-DRS, one containing X 3 , and the other containing X 10 . After splitting, dan-gling subgraphs are attached to the root of the new subgraph maximizing either proximity or position overlap. Here the graph rooted in X 11 is attached to the root dominating X 3 and the orphan word O 1 to the root dominating X 10 .

Deletion. The deletion model (cf. Table 2) reg-ulates the deletion of relations and their associated subgraph; of adjectives and adverbs; and of orphan words. Here, the relations in between X 3 and X 4 and for between X 10 and X 12 are deleted resulting in the deletion of the phrases  X  X n Physical Review Letters X  and  X  X or the first time X  as well as the ad-jectives second, massive, spin-zero and the orphan word which .

Substitution and Reordering. Finally the trans-lation and language model ensures that published, describing and boson are simplified to wrote, ex-plaining and elementary particle respectively; and that the phrase  X  X n 1964 X  is moved from the be-ginning of the sentence to its end. 3.2 The Simplification Model Our simplification framework consists of a prob-abilistic model for splitting and dropping which we call DRS simplification model (DRS-SM); a phrase based translation model for substitution and reordering (PBMT); and a language model learned on Simple English Wikipedia (LM) for fluency and grammaticality. Given a complex sen-tence c , we split the simplification process into two steps. First, DRS-SM is applied to D c (the DRS representation of the complex sentence c ) to produce one or more (in case of splitting) in-termediate simplified sentence(s) s  X  . Second, the simplified sentence(s) s  X  is further simplified to s using a phrase based machine translation system (PBMT+LM). Hence, our model can be formally defined as: where the probabilities p ( s  X  | D c ) , p ( s  X  | s ) and p ( s ) are given by the DRS simplification model, the phrase based machine translation model and the language model respectively.

To get the DRS simplification model, we com-bine the probability of splitting with the probabil-ity of deletion: where  X  is a sequence of simplification opera-tions and str (  X  ( D c )) is the sequence of words as-sociated with a DRS resulting from simplifying D c using  X  .

The probability of a splitting operation for a given DRS D c is:
That is, if the DRS is split on the splitting candi-date sp cand , the probability of the split is then given by the SPLIT table (Table 1) for the isSplit value  X  X rue X  and the split candidate sp cand ; else it is the product of the probability given by the SPLIT table for the isSplit value  X  X alse X  for all split candidate considered for D c . As mentioned above, the fea-tures used for determining the split operation are the role sets associated with pairs of event vari-ables (cf. Table 1).

The deletion probability is given by three mod-els: a model for relations determining the deletion of prepositional phrases; a model for modifiers (adjectives and adverbs) and a model for orphan words (Table 2). All three deletion models use the associated word itself as a feature. In addition, the model for relations uses the PP length-range as a feature while the model for orphan words relies on boundary information i.e., whether or not, the OW occurs at the associated sentence boundary. 3.3 Estimating the parameters We use the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) to estimate our split and deletion model parame-ters. For an efficient implementation of EM algo-rithm, we follow the work of Yamada and Knight (2001) and Zhu et al. (2010); and build training graphs (Figure 2) from the pair of complex and simple sentence pairs in the training data.

Each training graph represents a complex-simple sentence pair and consists of two types of nodes: major nodes (M-nodes) and operation nodes (O-nodes). An M-node contains the DRS representation D c of a complex sentence c and the associated simple sentence(s) s i while O-nodes determine split and deletion operations on their parent M-node. Only the root M-node is consid-ered for the split operations. For example, given the root M-node ( D c , ( s 1 ,s 2 )) , multiple success-ful split O-nodes will be created, each one further creating two M-nodes ( D c 1 ,s 1 ) and ( D c 2 ,s 2 ) . For the training pair ( c,s ) , the root M-node ( D c ,s ) is followed by a single split O-node producing an M-node ( D c ,s ) and counting all split candidates in D c for failed split. The M-nodes created after split op-erations are then tried for multiple deletion opera-tions of relations, modifiers and OW respectively. Each deletion candidate creates a deletion O-node marking successful or failed deletion of the can-didate and a result M-node. The deletion process continues on the result M-node until there is no deletion candidate left to process. The governing criteria for the construction of the training graph is that, at each step, it tries to minimize the Leven-shtein edit distance between the complex and the simple sentences. Moreover, for the splitting op-eration, we introduce a split only if the reference sentence consists of several sentences (i.e., there is a split in the training data); and only consider splits which maximises the overlap between split and simple reference sentences.
 We initialize our probability tables Table 1 and Table 2 with the uniform distribution, i.e., 0.5 be-cause all our features are binary. The EM algo-rithm iterates over training graphs counting model features from O-nodes and updating our probabil-ity tables. Because of the space constraints, we do not describe our algorithm in details. We refer the reader to (Yamada and Knight, 2001) for more details.
Our phrase based translation model is trained line options on the PWKP corpus (except the sen-tences from the test set) considering the complex sentence as the source and the simpler one as the target. Our trigram language model is trained us-
Decoding. We explore the decoding graph sim-ilar to the training graph but in a greedy approach always picking the choice with maximal probabil-ity. Given a complex input sentence c , a split O-node will be selected corresponding to the deci-sion of whether to split and where to split. Next, deletion O-nodes are selected indicating whether or not to drop each of the deletion candidate. The DRS associated with the final M-node D fin is then further simplified using the phrase-based machine translation system to produce the final simplified We trained our simplification and translation mod-els on the PWKP corpus. To evaluate perfor-mance, we compare our approach with three other state of the art systems using the test set provided by Zhu et al. (2010) and relying both on automatic metrics and on human judgments. 4.1 Training and Test Data The DRS-Based simplification model is trained on PWKP, a bi-text of complex and simple sen-tences provided by Zhu et al. (2010). To construct this bi-text, Zhu et al. (2010) extracted complex and simple sentences from EWKP and SWKP re-spectively and automatically aligned them using TF*IDF as a similarity measure. PWKP contains 108016 / 114924 complex/simple sentence pairs. We tokenize PWKP using Stanford CoreNLP Finally, our DRS-Based simplification model is trained on 97 . 75% of PWKP; we drop out 2 . 25% of the complex sentences in PWKP which are re-peated in the test set or for which Boxer fails to produce DRSs. We evaluate our model on the test set used by Zhu et al. (2010) namely, an aligned corpus of 100 / 131 EWKP/SWKP sentences. Boxer pro-duces a DRS for 96 of the 100 input sentences. These input are simplified using our simplifica-tion system namely, the DRS-SM model and the phrase-based machine translation system (Section 3.2). For the remaining four complex sentences, Boxer fails to produce DRSs. These four sen-tences are directly sent to the phrase-based ma-chine translation system to produce simplified sen-tences. 4.2 Automatic Evaluation Metrics To assess and compare simplification systems, two main automatic metrics have been used in previ-ous work namely, BLEU and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Index (FKG).

The FKG index is a readability metric taking into account the average sentence length in words and the average word length in syllables. In its original context (language learning), it was ap-plied to well formed text and thus measured the simplicity of a well formed sentence. In the con-text of the simplification task however, the auto-matically generated sentences are not necessarily well formed so that the FKG index reduces to a measure of the sentence length (in terms of words and syllables) approximating the simplicity level of an output sentence irrespective of the length of the corresponding input. To assess simplifica-tion, we instead use metrics that are directly re-lated to the simplification task namely, the number of splits in the overall (test and training) data and in average per sentences; the number of generated sentences with no edits i.e., which are identical to the original, complex one; and the average Leven-shtein distance between the system X  X  output and both the complex and the simple reference sen-tences.

BLEU gives a measure of how close a system X  X  output is to the gold standard simple sentence. Be-cause there are many possible ways of simplifying a sentence, BLEU alone fails to correctly assess the appropriateness of a simplification. Moreover BLEU does not capture the degree to which the system X  X  output differs from the complex sentence input. We therefore use BLEU as a means to eval-uate how close the systems output are to the refer-ence corpus but complement it with further man-ual metrics capturing other important factors when evaluating simplifications such as the fluency and the adequacy of the output sentences and the de-gree to which the output sentence simplifies the input. 4.3 Results and Discussion Number of Splits Table 3 shows the proportion of input whose simplification involved a splitting operation. While our system splits in proportion similar to that observed in the training data, the other systems either split very often (80% of the time for Zhu and 63% of the time for Woodsend) or not at all (Wubben). In other words, when com-pared to the other systems, our system performs splits in proportion closest to the reference both in terms of total number of splits and of average number of splits per sentence.
 Table 3: Proportion of Split Sentences (% split) in the training/test data and in average per sen-tence (average split / sentence). GOLD is the test data with the gold standard SWKP sentences; Zhu, Woodsend, Wubben are the best output of the models of Zhu et al. (2010), Woodsend and Lap-ata (2011) and Wubben et al. (2012) respectively; Hybrid is our model.
 Number of Edits Table 4 indicates the edit dis-tance of the output sentences w.r.t. both the com-plex and the simple reference sentences as well as the number of input for which no simplification occur. The right part of the table shows that our system generate simplifications which are closest to the reference sentence (in terms of edits) com-pared to those output by the other systems. It also produces the highest number of simplifica-tions which are identical to the reference. Con-versely our system only ranks third in terms of dis-similarity with the input complex sentences (6.32 edits away from the input sentence) behind the Woodsend (8.63 edits) and the Zhu (7.87 edits) system. This is in part due to the difference in splitting strategies noted above : the many splits applied by these latter two systems correlate with a high number of edits.
 Table 4: Automated Metrics for Simplification: average Levenshtein distance (LD) to complex and simple reference sentences per system ; number of input sentences for which no simplification occur (No edit).
 BLEU score We used Moses support tools: multi-bleu 10 to calculate BLEU scores. The BLEU scores shown in Table 4 show that our sys-tem produces simplifications that are closest to the reference.

In sum, the automatic metrics indicate that our system produces simplification that are consis-tently closest to the reference in terms of edit dis-tance, number of splits and BLEU score. 4.4 Human Evaluation The human evaluation was done online using the evaluators were allocated a trial set using a Latin Square Experimental Design (LSED) such that each evaluator sees the same number of output from each system and for each test set item. Dur-ing the experiment, the evaluators were presented with a pair of a complex and a simple sentence(s) and asked to rate this pair w.r.t. to adequacy (Does the simplified sentence(s) preserve the meaning of the input?) and simplification (Does the gen-erated sentence(s) simplify the complex input?). They were also asked to rate the second (sim-plified) sentence(s) of the pair w.r.t. to fluency (Is the simplified output fluent and grammatical?). Similar to the Wubben X  X  human evaluation setup, we randomly selected 20 complex sentences from Zhu X  X  test corpus and included in the evaluation corpus: the corresponding simple (Gold) sentence from Zhu X  X  test corpus, the output of our system (Hybrid) and the output of the other three sys-tems (Zhu, Woodsend and Wubben) which were provided to us by the system authors. The eval-uation data thus consisted of 100 complex/simple pairs. We collected ratings from 27 participants. All were either native speakers or proficient in En-glish, having taken part in a Master taught in En-glish or lived in an English speaking country for an extended period of time.
 Table 5: Average Human Ratings for simplicity, fluency and adequacy
Table 5 shows the average ratings of the human evaluation on a slider scale from 0 to 5. Pairwise comparisons between all models and their statisti-cal significance were carried out using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD tests and are shown in Table 6.
 Table 6:  X  / is/not significantly different (sig. diff.) wrt simplicity. / is/not sig. diff. wrt fluency.  X  / N is/not sig. diff. wrt adequacy. (sig-nificance level: p &lt; 0.05)
With regard to simplification, our system ranks first and is very close to the manually simpli-fied input (the difference is not statistically signif-icant). The low rating for Woodsend reflects the high number of unsimplified sentences (24/100 in the test data used for the automatic evaluation and 6/20 in the evaluation data used for human judg-ments). Our system data is not significantly differ-ent from the manually simplified data for simplic-ity whereas all other systems are.
 For fluency, our system rates second behind Wubben and before Woodsend and Zhu. The difference between our system and both Zhu and Woodsend system is significant. In partic-ular, Zhu X  X  output is judged less fluent proba-bly because of the many incorrect splits it li-censes. Manual examination of the data shows that Woodsend X  X  system also produces incorrect splits. For this system however, the high propor-tion of non simplified sentences probably counter-balances these incorrect splits, allowing for a good fluency score overall.

Regarding adequacy, our system is against clos-est to the reference (3.50 for our system vs. 3.66 for manual simplification). Our system, the Wubben system and the manual simplifications are in the same group (the differences between these systems are not significant). The Wood-send system comes second and the Zhu system third (the difference between the two is signifi-cant). Wubben X  X  high fluency, high adequacy but low simplicity could be explained with their min-imal number of edit (3.33 edits) from the source sentence.

In sum, if we group together systems for which there is no significant difference, our system ranks first (together with GOLD) for simplicity; first for fluency (together with GOLD and Wubben); and first for adequacy (together with GOLD and Wubben). A key feature of our approach is that it is seman-tically based. Typically, discourse level simplifi-cation operations such as sentence splitting, sen-tence reordering, cue word selection, referring ex-pression generation and determiner choice are se-mantically constrained. As argued by Siddharthan (2006), correctly capturing the interactions be-tween these phenomena is essential to ensuring text cohesion. In the future, we would like to investigate how our framework deals with such discourse level simplifications i.e., simplifications which involves manipulation of the coreference and of the discourse structure. In the PWKP data, the proportion of split sentences is rather low (6.1 %) and many of the split sentences are simple sen-tence coordination splits. A more adequate but small corpus is that used in (Siddharthan, 2006) which consists of 95 cases of discourse simplifica-tion. Using data from the language learning or the children reading community, it would be interest-ing to first construct a similar, larger scale corpus; and to then train and test our approach on more complex cases of sentence splitting.
