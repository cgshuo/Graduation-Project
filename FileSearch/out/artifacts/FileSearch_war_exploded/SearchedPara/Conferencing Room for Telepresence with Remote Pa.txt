 Many HCI researchers have dem onstrated that web and video conferencing do a poor job of preserving nonverbal cues and may not be comparable to person-to-person meetings because it changes the nature of informa tion processing and imposes more cognitive burden by users. However, many industrial conferences and meetings are moving from person-to-person communication to device-to-device communication including phone/web/video conferencing because of benefits like travel cost/time reduction, convenience, and to leverage the global workforce. To overcome limitations of de vice-to-device communication, novel commercial devices and research prototypes, such as spatial audio/speaker, high-definition and spatial video/display, physical surrogates, or interactive digital whiteboard, have been developed. We would like to understand better about effectiveness of these new devices for conferencing, and drive suggestion and direction for future conferencing room environment.

 Design, Human Factors, Measurement. Video conferencing, telepresence, conference room devices. The demand for better conferencing experience with remote participants has risen rapidly to reduce travel time and cost, to increase productivity, and to leverage the global workforce. Usually conference rooms in workplace have devices such as large displays, speaker, microphone, a laptop connector for data/presentation sharing, vide o conferencing system and a phone, to communicate with remote partic ipants. However, those devices have limitation to deliver full dynamics of face-to-face meetings in room, and remote participants still feel like second-class citizen during conferencing. We are currently conducting a research to understand effectiveness of current and new conferencing devices to overcome limitations of device-to -device communication and to deliver telepresence experience. In this paper, we present our findings based on review of prior research on conferencing devices. There are many new devices and novel technological approaches for communication, which make pe ople excited, but they do not always follow user adoption. We reviewed several devices to deliver better conferencing experience in workplace with remote participants. Several researchers have explored be nefits of spatial audio. Baldis [2] explored non-spatial audio in comparison to two high-fidelity, spatial audio conditions, and the results demonstrated significant performance benefits for the two spatial audio conditions. Yankelovich et al. [12] found that high-fidelity stereo audio improves task performance and speaker differentiation, and increases a sense of social presence. Kilgore et al. [8] also explored spatial audio, and cont rary to other results, they found no significant increase in memory but participants did prefer the spatial audio over monaural. Inkpen et al. [6] also did not reveal any significant differences between mono audio and the spatialized audio conditions, with the exception that mono conversations without video were harder to track. Two previous research [2][12], which used high-end systems to situate the audio streams, demonstrated the significance of spatial audio feature. However, research with low-fidelity approach which experimented spatial audi o using separate microphones to transmit signals to separate sp eakers, did not find significant difference of spatial audio effect [8][6]. This implies that quality of audio via high-fidelity approach seems more important factor to deliver better conferencing experience than just spatiality. Adding a video stream to audio stream can reduce the cognitive load in determining who is talking and also conveys visual cues of the current speaker. Cutler et al. [5] has shown that providing one video stream of the current speaker and another showing a panoramic view of all participan ts was highly valued. Issacs and Tang [7] and Sellen [10] articulated several benefits of video, including the ability to show unde rstanding, forecast responses, and use gestures to emphasize a point. Inkpen et al. [6] suggested that sp atial video, similar to the Hydra system [4] in that they serve as proxies for the remote participants, has a stronger impact on users X  perceived engagement, their ability to keep track of the conversation, and perceived quality of the conversation. This research also suggested that video conferencing with high-definition displays could make spatial audio redundant. Physical surrogate is designed to enhance a sense of social presence for remote meeting participants. The Porta-Person [13] is a telepresence device with a display screen, a video camera, stereo speakers, stereo microphones, a custom-built stereo echo canceller, and a motor attached to a rotating platform. Anybots [1] and Telbotics [11] are one of many telepresence robots, which address some of the problems of presence awareness. These telepresence robots include similar capabilities of Porta-Person in addition to robotic mobility. The psychological power of a person X  X  voice coming from a point source in the room was one of Buxton X  X  compelling insights. It enables parallel conversations [4 ]. Physical surrogates allow remote participants to have side conversation with people in the room. Further research needs to be conducted to understand full effectiveness of physical surrogates in real workplace environment. Seeing, talking and listening is just part of conferencing experience. We sometimes communicate by drawing ideas on a whiteboard. Then, how can we deliver information on a physical whiteboard to remote participants and also reflect their inputs to the same whiteboard? There are commercial offerings of electronic whiteboards for remote whiteboard collaboration, but these systems have yet to replace traditional whiteboards in the workplace. This lack of adoption cannot be ascribed only to cost. Electronic whiteboards fail on a number of dimensions in comparison to traditional whiteboards: they lack resolution, they are often turned off to save power, they have technol ogical dependencies that often result in unreliable availability, they are not as easy to use, input mechanisms do not provide nuanced stroke expressions, and so on [3]. Saund [9] and Branham et al. [3] believed a camera-based approach for capturing electronic and conventional boards is useful to accommodate whiteboard information including physical content (e.g. sticky notes, papers, pictures) that users often attach contextual reference unavailable on digital boards. Similarly, one product manager w ith lots of meeting experience shared her thoughts:  X  X  think being able to capture and show the whiteboard would be enough for remote participants for discussion X . For better user adopti on, we believe that being able to deliver whiteboard information with high-quality live video or image would be good start. We are planning to continue our research, and review more of other new devices to understand e ffectiveness and possible user adoption for conferencing. Furthe r, we would like to suggest novel device design implications and to develop design of new conferencing room environment that would overcome some of device-to-device communication limitations and provide full dynamics of face-to-face meeting like experience to remote participants.
