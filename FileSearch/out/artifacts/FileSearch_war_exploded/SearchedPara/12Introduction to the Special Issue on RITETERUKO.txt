 The NTCIR 1 Workshop is a series of evaluation workshops designed to enhance re-search in information access technologies, such as information retrieval, question an-swering, summarization, and text mining. The main goal of the NTCIR project is to provide infrastructure for large-scale evaluations of information access technologies, and then to speed up the research and the technology transfer. The major components of the infrastructure are reusable test collections, evaluation metrics, and a forum for researchers. As the fundamental text processing in information access technologies, such as indexing, which includes language-dependent procedures, the NTCIR work-shop has placed emphasis on, but has not limited it to, East Asian languages, such as Japanese, Chinese, and Korean, (and English documents published in Asia), and its series of workshops has attracted international participation.

An NTCIR workshop is held once every year and a half. In NTCIR, which is different from ordinary scientific conferences, the organizers and participating research groups have worked together in the process before the final meeting. The task organizers propose the tasks, the data sets used for experiments, and the evaluation metrics and methods and each of the participating research groups can participate for their own purposes and targets, and conduct research and experiments using the same data set provided by NTCIR. The experimental results are collected, and analyses and cross-system comparisons are reported on at the final meeting. After the meeting, most of the test collections constructed through the NTCIR workshop are made available to non-participating research groups for research purposes. NTCIR-9, the ninth verion of the NTCIR, started its call for task participation from September 2010 and concluded the activities by the workshop held on 6th X 9th December 2011, in Tokyo, Japan [Sakai and Joho 2011].
 In NTCIR-9, the RITE (Recognizing Inference in Text) task was organized for Japanese, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese [Shima et al. 2011]. We eval-uated the systems that recognized textual entailment, paraphrase, contradiction, and independent relations between texts. The RITE task had four subtasks: (1) Binary Class (BC), (2) Multi Class (MC), (3) Entrance Exam, and (4) RITE4QA. The BC sub-task required a system to identify if t 1 entails t 2 or not, given a pair of texts ( t 1 , t 2 ). In the MC subtask, a system had to recognize the entailment directions (forward, re-verse, and bidirectional), as well as the contradiction and the independent relations. The Entrance Exam subtask was similar to the BC, but the dataset was created from real data from a past Japanese National Center Test for University Admissions. This subtask was created only for Japanese. The RITE4QA subtask was also similar to the BC and it was created from the past NTCIR factoid Question Answering datasets, but this subtask was for all three languages. Although the shared task evaluations for Recognizing Textual Entailment have been active in English and other European languages, this was the first large-scale open evaluation for Asian languages. The uniqueness of the RITE task was to recognize the four types of relations as well as the entailment directions. In addition, the use of real data from the University entrance examinations and from the Question Answering system outputs makes the task more realistic. Since the textual inference research would be beneficial for various Informa-tion Access applications, such as QA, IR, IE, and Text Summarization, it is our hope that the RITE task would stimulate and advance our research in deep understanding of textual information.

There were 24 participating teams from five different countries for the RITE task, and there were 212 system runs in total. The RITE task had the largest number of par-ticipants among the tasks offered in NTCIR-9. For the TALIP special issue on RITE, we received eight articles and the each submitted article was reviewed by three ref-erees, each of which followed the standard review procedures of ACM-TALIP. As a result, six articles were selected for publication. Each article contains extensive work and results much beyond the original RITE tasks.
