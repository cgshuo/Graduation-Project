 When searching, people X  X  information needs flow through to expressing an information retrieval request posed to a search engine. We hypothesise that the degree of specificity of an IR request might correspond to the length of a search query. Our results show a strong correlation between decreasing query length and increasing broadness or generality of the IR request. We found an average cross-over point of specificity from broad to narrow of 3 words in the query. These results have implications for search engines in responding to queries of differing lengths.
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Query for-mulation Experimentation, Human Factors Information need, search query length, IR request specificity
People use search engines by expressing their information need as a (textual) search query  X  the information retrieval request. The search engine then returns a ranked list of documents. The person then reviews the list and browses to individual documents, or issues a new search.

From a search engine X  X  perspective, a query may be the entire expression of a person X  X  nuanced information need. But usually it is just a few words in length. To improve the quality of the ranking, it would be valuable to know if the specificity of the IR request and, by implication, the person X  X  original information need is narrow or broad. We investigate only searchers X  subjective assessment of specificity. An ex-ample broad information need might be  X  X nformation about cows X , and a corresponding IR request  X  X ows X .

Ingwersen and J  X arvelin characterise six dimensions to IR requests [2]; one of which is  X  X eneric vs. specific X . In their critique of current IR research practices, they identify a need to gather further evidence on these dimensions and their ef-fect on retrieval performance. They also characterise infor-mation needs in multiple dimensions, including the quality of current knowledge and knowledge state specificity. The specificity of an IR request is likely to be related to these two dimensions of the searcher X  X  original information need, but it may be a complex relationship.

Ram  X  X rez and de Vries use the terms  X  X road X  and  X  X ar-row X  for these concepts while investigating request type as a contextual feature [4]. They performed manual classifi-cation of a number of information need descriptions, with a view to segmenting the request population for evaluating performance and user satisfaction.

Several researchers have examined query logs and length relationships. For example, Lau and Horvitz explore query refinement behaviour on large search logs, observing that queries become longer as query refinement occurs [3].
We carried out three experiments to investigate our hy-pothesis that the specificity of an IR request is related to its search engine query length.
For the first two experiments, participants were asked to read a search query, imagine a corresponding information need (for which they might have typed the query into a search engine), and then make a judgement on a 4-point scale ((very) narrow to (very) broad) about the information need X  X  specificity. These instructions may fail to adequately separate specificity from other dimensions of the information need and subsequent IR request.

The first experiment used archived search query logs of a national government search engine (govsearch.australiagov.au). This dataset was chosen as least likely of the query logs we had available to be noticeably biased towards particular populations of users.

The queries were placed in buckets by length (1 . . . 9, &amp; 10+). A random selection of 100 queries was made, 10 from each bucket, and vetted to remove queries with mis-spellings and acronyms that participants might fail to understand. Random replacements were made until 10 queries per bucket were present. On registration, a unique subset of 50 queries was randomly and uniformly chosen for each participant (i.e. 5 per bucket).

Using a basic web form with four radio buttons to judge their specificity, participants were presented with their 50 queries (one at a time), displayed from their selection in random order to avoid any biases due to length. 1500 queries were judged by 30 participants. We combined Figure 1: Expts 1 &amp; 2  X  Specificity vs query length the counts of people voting for very broad and broad ratings, and for very narrow and narrow ratings. We used Pearson X  X  Correlation to assess the association between specificity and query length. These were well above the minimum corre-lation coefficient of 0.463. Thus we may state that there is a statistically highly significant relationship (99% con-fidence level) between narrow/broad specificity and query The Kendall tau coefficients were narrow  X  = 0 . 828, 2-sided p = 0 . 0015; broad  X  =  X  0 . 828, 2-sided p = 0 . 0015.
Graphing the normalized results (Figure 1) with polyno-mial lines (order 5) of best fit we detect an intersection between broadness and narrowness at 3 words. To sum-marise, as query length increases, the corresponding infor-mation need is more likely to be perceived to be narrow. The second experiment used the same method as the first. A random sample of 100 topics from a series of collections used in TREC Ad Hoc and Web tracks was used as the dataset; we also had fewer participants (16). The purpose was two-fold: to validate that the results obtained could be replicated, and to use a dataset that other groups without access to query logs could use too.

The minimum Pearson X  X  correlation coefficient is 0.623 (  X &lt; 0 . 01). Again, the results calculated exceed this min-imum value to indicate a correlation ( r narrow (14) = 0 . 737, r broad (14) =  X  0 . 737 , X &lt; 0 . 01). Computing the Kendall tau coefficient confirms this result, though less strongly than in Experiment 1, and not at a 5% confidence level. (nar-row  X  = 0 . 449, p = 0 . 088; broad  X  =  X  0 . 449, p = 0 . 088.) More noise was observed at large query lengths, which might smooth out with more queries or more participants. The normalized results are shown in Figure 1, and are similar.
To address possible biases or flaws in the method of the previous experiments (for example, participants were judg-ing queries from other people and had to imagine an infor-mation need), another experiment was undertaken. This ex-periment required participants to imagine their own narrow and broad information needs, and express these as search queries. A basic web form displaying text boxes (two for narrow, two for broad) was given to participants to fill in.
We had 30 participants, and placed the queries into buck-ets similar to the other experiments (1 . . . 5 &amp; 6+ words). The minimum Pearson X  X  correlation coefficient is 0.463 for  X &lt; 0 . 01 and 0.361 for  X &lt; 0 . 05. The Pearson X  X  result for narrowness is r narrow (28) = 0 . 288, and the Kendall tau correlation is  X  = 0 . 298, 2-sided p = 0 . 546. We conclude short queries are not correlated with narrowness. However, the Pearson result for broadness is above this minimum  X  r broad (28) =  X  0 . 846 , X &lt; 0 . 01 and the Kendall tau correla-tion is  X  =  X  0 . 867, p = 0 . 024. Peaks of 2 and 4 words exist for broad and narrow.

From this, we see that queries are more likely to be broader as the length of a query decreases. The experiment also confirmed that users tend to use short queries in general, as shown in the workload distribution for the national gov-ernment X  X  large (16000+) query log (overlaid in Figure 2). In other words, uniform distribution of query lengths does not occur in real-life situations. We found 3 words to be the cross-over point again.

However, users may provide narrow queries at all query lengths. This result accords with general intuitions about web search  X  that people often have very narrow informa-tion needs (e.g. the home/best/known page finding task [1]) which can be expressed and satisfied with short queries. Figure 2: Expt 3  X  Workload (percentage of queries)
We hypothesised that there is a correlation between query length and the degree of specificity of a query. Our exper-iments partially validate this theory (for broadness), and indicate a cross-over of 3 words for queries being 2-3 times more frequently about narrow than broad information needs.
Deeper analysis of query characteristics to identify fea-tures which could be extracted to indicate narrowness in short queries is indicated. For example, detection of best page queries through anchor text matching. This would ad-dress the issue of short but specific queries. We plan to conduct experiments to investigate searcher preference for different result ranking when information needs are broad.
