Preliminary of probabilistic databases and top-k queries 2.1. Probabilistic database model
Generally, the probabilistic database D  X  t 1 ; ... ; t n almost all probabilistic tuples in probabilistic databases are independent.
De fi nition 1. Probability of a tuple is the likelihood of a tuple appearing in the data set presented as a new dimension in the table with values of 0 Example: In Table 1 , tuple t 1 has a 0.29 probability of obtaining a USD $25 profit.

The probability of the existence of possible world W which are the likelihood and unlikelihood of tuples in the possible world W possible world space.
 Example: Table 2 is the possible world space that lists all possible worlds of Table 1 . model, they are grouped as a generation rule.

De fi nition 4. The top-k probability of a tuple pr top k ( t i
Mathematically, the top-k probability of a tuple pr top k the tuple is in the top-k .

Let probabilistic data D be a ranked sequence ( t 1 , t 2 (1  X  i  X  n ) be a subsequence from t 1 to t i .

In the possible world space, the top-k probability of tuple t tuple t i is ranked at the ( j +1) th position, there are also j tuples in the subsequence set S worlds.

Theorem 1. Given a ranked sequence S t i  X  t 1 ; t 2 ; ... ; sequence S t i .pr S t i ; j is calculated as follows: pr S t In special cases
B pr (  X  ,0) = 1
B pr (  X  ,j) = 0

Theorem 2. Suppose that tuple t i and the subsequence S t ( n &gt; i  X  j &gt;0) .pr ( t i , j ) is calculated as follows: This Poisson binomial recurrence has been proven in [24].

Example: Given the data set in Table 1 , the 1st and 2nd rank probabilities of tuple t to kth probabilities of tuple t i .

Theorem 3. Given a tuple t i ,pr top k ( t i ) is the top-k probability of t follows:
Example: Given the data set in Table 1 , the top-2 probability of tuple t possible worlds. 2.3. Calculation of top-k probability with a generation rule account.

Let a probabilistic database D  X  t 1 ; t 2 ; ... ; t n  X  X  with t tuple t i . 2.3.1. Exclusive rules
Tuples in the same rule are mutually exclusive R  X  h  X  t h calculate the top-k probability.

To compute the top-k probability pr top k ( t i ) of tuple t t  X  ...  X  t h than or equal to tuple t i . The tuples involved in R hRight t .  X 
Case 1: R hLeft + =  X  , i.e. all the tuples in rule R h + when calculating the top-k probability of tuple t i . Consequently, all tuples in R  X 
Case 2: R hLeft +  X   X  , i.e. all tuples in R hRight + can be ignored, and the tuples in R probability of t i . There are two sub-cases for these changes. these tuples will be removed from subsequence S t i  X  1 when calculating pr + Sub-case 2: t i  X  R hLeft + , i.e. all tuples in R hLeft theorems are used normally.

Example: In Table 1 , the top-2 probability of tuples t 6 and R + = t 3  X  t 6 . The subsequence S t respectively.

The exclusive rules are produced in subsequence S t 6 .  X 
In exclusive rule R 2 + , t 3 is removed because t 3 and t  X 
In exclusive rule R 1 + , t 2  X  t 4 are produced as t 2  X  4
The subsequence S t 6 is produced by the exclusive rule { t pr 2 ( t 6 ) with the set S t 2.3.2. Inclusive rules
Tuples in the same rule are mutually inclusive R h  X   X  t h possible worlds. To compute the top-k probability pr top following cases. -Case 1: All the tuples in rule R h  X  are ranked lower than tuple t -Case 2: At least one tuple in inclusive rule R h  X  is ranked higher than or equal to tuple t
Theorem 3 is modified as follows: +Sub-case2: t i  X  R h  X  ,i.e.thereare z tuples ranked higher than t tuple t R as follows:
B pr S t

Example: Assuming two inclusive rules R 1  X  = t 3  X  t 5 and R p ( R )= p ( t 4 )= p ( t 6 ) = 0.4 are in probabilistic database D X  t rules are produced in subsequence S t 5 .  X  because t 4 has a higher rank than t 6 . We compute the top-4 probability of tuple t -In inclusive rule R 1  X  = t 3  X  t 5 , tuples t 3 , t 5 are ranked higher than tuple t probability p ( t 3,5 )= p ( R 1  X  ) = 0.7. The set S t 5 the inclusive rule is applied to calculate the top-4 probability of tuple t 3. The top-k best probability queries 3.1.

De fi nition 5. Domination of top-k probability tuples
For any tuples t i and t j in probabilistic data, t i dominates t probability of t i is greater than the top-k probability of t
Example: in Table 3 , tuple t 3 dominates t 5 , because t top-2 probability (0.7304) of t 3 is greater than top-2 probability (0.3072) of t
De fi nition 6. Non-dominated tuple
Example: in Table 3 , tuples t 1 and t 3 are the non-dominated tuples in the set { t which are in both the top-k best ranking scores and the best top-k probabilities.
De fi nition 7. Top-k best probability query
The answer to the top-k best probability query Q top k consists of two sets Q score tuples in the data without considering the top-k probabilities, and Q probability in the set D  X  Q score fg  X  t pmin
Q , and remove the redundant tuples based on the non-dominated tuples concept for set Q highest scores tuples, therefore t pmin is selected as the lowest top-k probability in Q have better top-k probabilities in the rest of tuples { D answer set to the top-2 best probability query is Q top 2 without considering the top-2 probabilities (the common result), and Q top-k probability in { t 1 , t 3 , t 4 , t 5 , t 6 }, where t 3.2.

Proof. The top-k probability of t i + m is calculated by Theorem 3
In the worst case, t i + m is in exclusive rule R h .
For any m &gt; 1, we have sequence S t i S t i  X  m  X  1 . It is also true when calculating the pr
In exclusive rules, we have t R hLeft  X  t L max for any produced tuples
For the probability of any tuple, we have 0 b p ( t i + m Hence, if bestPr  X  3.4. The top-k best probability algorithm
Algorithm 1 finds the top-k best probability answer Q top  X  score of the probability data set, the first k tuples { t minimum top-k probabilities from t 1 to t k (line 5) and the first value of p minimum pr top k which equals the bestPr (line 6).  X 
The set Q pro containing non-dominated tuples is selected from lines 8 to 13. A current tuple t set Q top k (line 12). The new values of bestPr and p prev  X  ( p ( t i )&gt; bestPr ) is presented for Theorem 4 , and the second condition ( p ( t non-dominated tuples in the rest of the tuples.  X
