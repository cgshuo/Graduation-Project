The business environment is so dynamic that managers are always trying to catch up with the changing world in which they operate, which prompts enterprises to adapt themselves efficiently in order to stay ahead of their competitors. To achieve this, managers have to understand the facts lying behind the change to support better decisions. Unfortunately, that is not easy, not only because it is difficult to find out the true reality behind the phenomenon, but also because it is not easy to communicate the interpretations be-tween each other.

Business successes inevitably require collaboration, especially in the information age where information technology (IT) is indispensable for all business. However, there exist a communication problem between business strategists and the IT team, as they may have different vocabularies and languages. In most cases, even when they are probably talking about the same concept, or at most with a little deviation, they mis-understand each other.

This book is about how to develop a new dynamic and adaptive information infrastructure to learn new behaviors, find patterns, rebuild organizations for different platforms, transform data on the fly and estab-lish new communications without programming, and follow process rules without knowing about specific services in advance. The authors attempt to achieve the aim by using semantic interoperability technologies, which is the key concept of this book.

As described in (Miller, 2000):  X  X  To be interoperable , one should actively be engaged in the ongoing process of ensuring that the systems , procedures and culture of an organization are managed in such a way as to max-imize opportunities for exchange and re-use of information , whether internally or externally.  X  X 
In this book, Pollock and Hodgson define semantic interoperability as  X  X  a dynamic enterprise capability meanings of digital content without human involvement X  X hich in turn drives adaptive business processes , enter-prise knowledge , business rules , and enterprise application interoperability.  X  X  (Pollock and Hodgson, p. 6).
The authors claim that business benefits can be achieved through the use of technologies that support semantic interoperability. They can:  X  increase profits by faster response to market demands, better decision making, and cheaper adoption of new strategies.
  X  bring new capabilities by dynamic information repurposing and reconfiguration, adaptive service-ori-ented networks, and loosely coupled application connections and information.  X  reduce costs by faster data analysis and dissemination, better quality of service in partner exchanges, and cheaper maintenance costs for IT systems integration.
 Overall, this book is organized into three parts.

The first part discusses the necessity of semantic interoperability. The information technology does mat-ter to businesses, but current implementation of information sharing infrastructures have to rely on high degrees of human involvement. There is a desire to achieve the status of frictionless information exchange in the future by semantic interoperability.

The second part introduces concrete techniques of semantic interoperability. Raw data has to be trans-formed into useful information through meaningful interpretation. Much more attention should be paid to the semantic conflict solution patterns during the transformation.
 Machine Learning Pattern, Third-Party Reference Pattern, Model-Based Mapping Pattern and Inference
Pattern are the four main patterns. There is also another type of data to interpret: Metadata, the data about data. Metadata could be decomposed in 6 layers from low to high: Instance Data, Syntactic Metadata,
Structural Metadata, Referent Metadata, Domain Metadata and Rules Metadata. To be smarter, the sys-tems need the ability to deal with commonsense knowledge. One solution is to construct Ontology design patterns. Also, multiple  X  X  X odes X  X  of semantic solutions are required for enterprise, because we need to de-scribe different modes of operation, different service interfaces, different technologies, and different function points. Four infrastructure patterns are also discussed in part two. They present innovative approaches for combining the strengths of Web Services, EAI, and Semantic Web technologies into a cohesive infrastruc-ture that demonstrates value to enterprise architects and business managers.

In part three, the authors provide case studies for different interoperability situations. Adoption strate-gies are also discussed in this part. In the last chapter, the authors take a forward look at tomorrow  X  s adap-tive and dynamic systems.

It could be easily seen that the authors have a keen observation in the business environment. They accu-rately discover the most important issues in business. While many are cheering and fully confident of intro-ducing IT into business organizations, the authors have discovered the communication problems between business strategists and IT team. Although most of the technologies and models currently exist, one still has to acknowledge their pioneering and conception of using semantic interoperability into constructing an infrastructure to facilitate the communication among different groups of people.

It is also such an integrative book that concerns a variety of areas, from high level business principles to detailed technical descriptions. The authors analyze many different technologies, and discussed their possi-bilities to be used in creating the IT infrastructure.

We understand the authors  X  attempts of organising the book in a logic and coherent way. However, it is still less systematic due to the variety of covered areas. Sometimes it is easy to get lost in read-ing. One would hope for a better structure that is easier to situate particular content within the whole context.

Another thing we would like to mention is the authors  X  attempt to create an infrastructure. However what they provide in their book are such high level concepts as the analysis of business environment, the possibilities of using different technologies, the characteristics of semantic interoperability and patterns of infrastructure. As the authors point out, semantic interoperability is a 15-year overnight success. It might be early at this time to achieve a real infrastructure based on semantic interoperability and to evaluate their attempts.

As a whole, we recommend this book, especially to: enterprise managers, IT teams, information systems researchers and developers, as well as all the people who are interested in management and information systems. References

Collaborative information technologies are generally understood as electronic technologies that support the work of groups of individuals engaged in collaborative tasks, usually in organizations. Let us assume, for example, a group of five mechanical engineers employed by the same automaker. Those mechanical engineers are located in five different cities and are engaged, through a Web-based conferencing system, in discussions about the design of a new fuel injection system for one of the company  X  s car models. The group would then be said to be making use of a collaborative information technology, in this case the just mentioned Web-based conferencing system.

The use of collaborative information technologies in organizations is on the rise, a trend that is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Such technologies, if properly used, may serve as the basis for serious cost-cutting and quality-enhancing organizational strategies such as outsourcing, strategic modularization, telecommuting, and virtual teamwork, such as in the automaker  X  s new product development team example provided above.

The practical relevance of collaborative information technologies has been reflected in academic research on the topic, which has taken a more applied orientation since the late 1990s and early 2000s. Yet, book volumes on the topic have been surprisingly scarce. This is a gap that  X  X  X ollaborative Information Technol-ogies X  X , a book edited by Mehdi Khosrow-Pour, aims at filling.

The book is a collection of 19 chapters by several authors; many of whom are well-known scholars and consultants in areas directly or indirectly related to the main topic of the book. The chapters cover a wide range of topics related to the main topic of collaborative information technologies. The book generally progresses from the discussion of conceptual issues in connection with the use of collaboration technolo-gies, to an exploration of the impact of those technologies on knowledge management and learning, to a review of issues and empirical findings related to virtual teams, and concluding with an exploration of what seem to be  X  X  X pecial topics X  X , like e-mail spam and mobile collaborative technologies.

The chapters devoted to conceptual issues in connection with the use of collaboration technologies cover topics such as organizational learning and knowledge communication, as well as define the different
