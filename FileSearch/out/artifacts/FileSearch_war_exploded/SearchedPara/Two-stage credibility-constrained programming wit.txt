 1. Introduction
The impact of human activities on the water resources system has become a global concern, in which water crisis is perceived to be the most signi fi cant issue facing the world today ( Kathleen et al., 2011 ). Water shortages affect human life and economy development, which can further lead to con fl ict-laden issues of water resources allocation among competing municipal, industrial, agricultural and ecological interests aggravating ( Barbalios et al., 2013 ; Su et al., 2013 ). Particularly in the recent years, the competition among water users has been intensi fi ed due to growing population shift, shrinking water availability, varying natural condition, and deteriorating water quality ( Li and Huang, 2008 ). Increasing water demands and the inadequate water supplies have exacerbated the shortage of water resources, which have brought adverse impacts on socio-economic development. On the other hand, water resources management systems are complicated with a variety of uncertainties and their interactions which may intensify the con fl ict laden issues of water allocation ( Li et al., 2006 ). These complexities can become further com-pounded not only by interactions among the uncertain parameters but also by additional economic implications. However, the tradi-tional simulation and optimization methods were effective for planning water resource systems with consideration of a number impact factors (e.g. economic objective, environmental require-ment, and policy regulation) as certain values, which led to dif fi culties in water planning scienti fi cally. Therefore, optimization techniques under uncertainty are required to accommodate to more comprehensive, complex and ambitious plans for water resources systems ( Li and Huang, 2009 ).
 supporting water resources management and planning under uncertainty ( Liong, 1991; Jairaj and Vedula, 2000; Montalvo et al., 2000; Sei fi and Hipel, 2001; Jim X nez et al., 2007; Li and
Huang, 2009; Li et al., 2010; Miao et al., 2013 ). For example, Huang and Loucks (2000) proposed an inexact two-stage stochastic programming (ITSP) method for water resources management under uncertainties, which could not only provide an effective linkage between policies and the economic penalties, but also tackle uncertainties in the model's left-and/or right-hand sides by interval programming; however, the ITSP had dif fi culties in deal-ing with vague information such as errors in acquired data and impreciseness of observed information. Maqsood et al. (2005) advanced an interval-parameter fuzzy two-stage stochastic pro-gramming (IFTSP) method for the planning of water resources systems under uncertainty, which could tackle recourse problems under a variety of policy scenarios, and also tackle uncertainties in constraints of water availabilities expressed by fuzzy set; however, the IFTSP was not effective for dealing with multiple ambiguous information in the objective function and constraints contempora-rily. Li and Huang (2011) developed a two-stage fuzzy-stochastic programming (TFSP) method for planning agricultural water resources management system, where ambiguous coef fi cients in the objective function and constraints were tackled; however, the
TFSP only measured the fuzzy uncertainties by possibility or feasibility individually, which could not consider necessity into fuzzy measure. Li et al. (2013) proposed an inexact two-stage credibility constrained programming (TCP) method for planning water quality management, which could measure fuzzy uncertain-ties by credibility measure (i.e., an average of the possibility measure and the necessity measure) to improve abilities on encode the vagueness of information; however, the TCP had dif fi culties in tackling multiple uncertainties existing in left-and right-hand sides of constraints as well as in objective function, meanwhile it was also dif fi cult to react risk preference of decision makers in decision process with uncertainties, which is adverse to obtain a compromised alternative on the eclecticism of pessimistic and optimistic.
 ties expressed fuzzy sets in left-and right-hand sides of constraints even in both sides of objective function synchro-nously, which can prove fuzzy determination by neutralizing alternative under uncertainties ( Saade and Schwarzlander, 1992; Jaafar et al., 2007; Wen and Iwamura, 2008 ). Optimistic and pessimistic criteria can facilitate to determine the compro-mising alternatives, which can pledge decision maker neither adventurous nor conservative in decision process with uncer-tain importations ( Lau et al., 2010 ). In fact, in practical water resources management problems, multiple uncertainties may exist in the left-and right-hand sides of constraints and in the objective function; these uncertainties can be further quanti as probabilities exist as fuzzy membership functions. Mean-while, these uncertainties expr essed as fuzzy set can be tackled by the eclecticism of pessimistic a nd optimistic. Previously, few studies were reported in the presentation and interpretation of multiple uncertainties in hybrid formats in the water resources management systems.
 policies for managing and planning water-resources allocation under uncertainty, they truly encounter dif fi culties when the mathematical models required the input data with anticipated prediction accuracy. For example, water demand from multiple users as the input data of the optimization models may mislead the optimization results if its prediction accuracy is too low.
Moreover, uncertainties also exist in water demand affected by a number of impact factors and system components (e.g., human activity, social development, sustainability requirement, and policy regulation), which not only aggravate complexities compounded by interactions among the uncertain parameters but also increases risks for decision makers in water resources allocation processes.
Consequently, accurate prediction for the amount of water-resources demand is crucial for planning of water resources management systems effectively. Previously, various prediction methods such as regression analysis, time series, index prediction, arti fi cial neural network and support vectors regression were proposed to support water resources prediction. ( Cheng et al., 2005; Chen and Chau, 2006; Muttil and Chau, 2006; Noori et al., 2009a, 2009b; Taormina et al., 2012 ). For example, Chau et al. (2005) proposed two hybrid models based on genetic algorithm-based arti fi cial neural network and the adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system for fl ood forecasting in China, which produced a better accuracy in performance. Wu et al. (2009) developed a crisp distributed support vectors regression model for monthly stream fl ow prediction in comparison with four other models, which improved the performance in accuracies. Alvisi et al. (2014) proposed a procedure for spatial aggregation of synthetic water demand time series, which could predict water demand based on requirement of users dynamically. Support vector regression (SVR) is one of prediction techniques, which can deal with problems with the characters of small samples, nonlinearity, high dimension, and local minima ( Noori et al., 2009a ). SVR technique is intended to alleviate the main drawback of parametric regression, which adheres to the principle of structural risk minimization seeking to minimize an upper bound of the generalization error, rather than minimize the training error ( Vapnik, 1998; Dai et al., 2011; Noori et al., 2009b ). Although SVR technique has extensively been employed to many real-world cases of environmental engineering problems, few studies focus on the application of SVR to water resources management and planning.
 credibility-constrained programming with Hurwicz criterion (TCP-HC) method for water resources management under uncertainty. TCP-HC can tackle uncertainties presente d as probability distributions and fuzzy sets; it can also promote capaci ties of fuzzy determination using the Hurwicz criterion. The developed TCP-HC method is applied to a real case of water resources management in Kaidu-kongque River Basin, which is one of the aridest regions in Northwest China.
Support-vector-regression (SVR) is introduced into the TCP-HC frame-work to predict the water demand of multiple users in the future, which can re fl ect dynamic, interactive, and uncertain characteristics of the water resources management system. Results will support the adjustment of the existing water-allocation pattern, as well as the planning of water resources management system to satisfy the increasing water demand. 2. Methodology tackle independent uncertainties in the constraint's left-and right-hand sides and thus optimize the satisfaction of the system performance ( Zhang and Huang, 2011 ). In CCP, cred-ibility constraints can be addressed through fuzzy sets in constraint to express relationship between satisfaction degree and system-failure risk. In general, a CCP model can be for-mulated as follows: max f  X   X  I subject to Cr  X  I () x
Z 0 ; i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; I  X  1c  X  where x  X  ( x 1 , x 2 , ... , x i ) is a vector of non-fuzzy decision variables, c i are cost coef fi cients, a ij are technical coef and b j are right-hand side coef fi cients, some of which can be expressed fuzzy numbers. Based on the concept of credibility to represent a chance of a fuzzy event, formula ( 1b )showsthat equal to credibility level  X  ( Zhang and Huang, 2011 ).
Let  X  be a fuzzy variable with membership function  X  , and let and r be real numbers. The possibility of a fuzzy event, charac-terized by  X  r r ,isde fi ned by Pos f  X  r r g X  sup necessity of a fuzzy event, characterized by  X  r r ,isde fi Nec f  X  r r g X  1 sup ibility measure ( Cr ) is an average of the possibility measure and the necessity measure ( Pishvaee et al., 2012 ) Cr  X  r r  X  1 2  X  Pos  X  r r  X  Nec  X  r r  X  X  2  X  Then, expected value  X  can be determined based on the credibility measure as ( Liu and Liu, 2002 ) E  X   X  Let ~  X   X  X   X  1 ;  X  2 ;  X  3 ;  X  4  X  be a trapezoidal fuzzy number (when According to Eq. (2) , the expected value of ~  X  is  X   X  1 and the corresponding credibility measures are as follows: Cr ~  X  r r no Cr ~  X  Z r no where r is the credibility level of constraint, which indicates the relationship between satisfaction degree and system-failure risk. Credibility measure that is expressed as credibility satisfaction level of fuzzy event in uncertain environment has been widely used in many real-world cases, which is more suitable to represent the chance of a fuzzy event than possibility does due to its property of self-dual ( Liu and Liu, 2002; Cherkassky and Ma, 2004 ; Lau et al., 2010 ). For example, an event with maximum possibility 1 might not happen while an event with maximum credibility 1 will surely occur. Furthermore, a fuzzy event with maximum possibility 1 sometimes carries no information while a fuzzy event with maximum credibility 1 means that the event will happen at the greatest chance ( Huang, 2006 ). In the optimization process for management and planning, it is usually assumed that the credibility level should be greater than 0.5 in response to avoiding improper unsatisfactions and violated risks ( Pishvaee et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013 ). Thus, it can be proven credibility measure when  X  4 0.5 Cr f ~  X  r r g Z  X  3 r Z  X  2 2  X   X   X  Cr f ~  X  Z r g Z  X  3 r Z  X  2 2  X   X   X  CCP has dif fi culties in tackling uncertainties expressed fuzzy sets existing in left-and right-hand sides of constraints even in both sides of objective function synchronously. Hurwicz criterion ana-lysis is effective to tackle such a problem by introducing optimistic and pessimistic criterion, which can prove fuzzy determination by neutralizing alternative under uncertainties ( Hurwicz, 1951 ). Therefore, introducing Hurwicz criterion into the CCP framework, a credibility-constrained programming with Hurwicz criterion (CPH) model can be formulated as follows: max f  X f  X  f opt  X  X  1  X   X  f pec g X  6a  X  subject to Cr  X  I () Cr  X  I () Cr  X  I () x
Z 0 ; i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; I  X  6e  X  where  X  (0 r  X  r 1) is the coef fi cient of optimism, which are weighted by the decision payoffs or costs in decision process; while (1  X  ) represent the measure of decision maker's pessimism con-versely. The Hurwicz criterion requires that maximum payoff (or minimum cost) multiplied by coef fi cient of optimism (  X  minimum payoff (or maximum cost) multiplied by the coef fi pessimism (1  X  )( Lau et al., 2010 ). Therefore, by changing coef cient  X  , the Hurwicz criterion becomes various criteria (e.g., an optimistic criterion;  X   X  0 degenerate a pessimistic criterion). credibility level to system bene fi ts with optimistic and pessimistic criterion, which indicated relationships between satisfaction and risk of system under two extreme Hurwicz criterion.

CPH can tackle uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets existing in coef fi cients of the objective function as well as left-and right-hand sides of the constraints, but which has dif fi culties in tackling uncertainties expressed as random variables in a non-fuzzy decision space (Inuiguchi et al., 2010); moreover, it is lack of linkage to economic consequences of violated policies pre-regulated by autho-rities through taking recourse actions in order to correct any infeasibilities ( Li et al., 2010 ). TSP can not only handle uncertainties expressed as random variables in non-fuzzy sets but also provide an effective linkage between the pre-regulated policies and the asso-ciated economic implications caused by improper policies. In TSP, an initial decision ( fi rst-stage decision) is made before the realiza-tion of random variables, then a recourse action can be taken after the disclosure of random variables (second-stage decision) ( Li et al., 2006 ). Generally, a TSP model can be formulated as follows: max f  X   X  subject to  X  x i Z 0 ; i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; I 1  X  7d  X  y ih Z 0 ; i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; I 2 ; h  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; H  X  7e  X  where x i is the vector of fi rst-stage decision variables, which have to be decided before the actual realizations of the random variables; e i x i is fi rst-stage bene fi ts; p h is probability of random event; y recourse at the second-stage under the occurrence of event; al., 2006 ); w h are random variables with probability levels p , where h  X  1, 2,., H and  X  H h  X  1 p h  X  1; A it , e i , s constraint. In water resources management problems, when uncer-tainties are presented in terms of both probability distributions and fuzzy sets, one potential approach for handling such complexities is to incorporate techniques of TSP and CHP, leading to a two-stage credibility-constrained programming with Hurwicz criterion (TCP-
CH) model as follows: max f  X f  X  f opt  X  X  1  X   X  f pec g X  8a  X  subject to Cr  X  Cr  X  x i Z 0 ; i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; I 1  X  8f  X  y ih Z 0 ; i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; I 1 ; h  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; H  X  8g  X 
Based on credibility measure of Eqs. (5a) and (5b) , models (8) can be transformed into max f  X f  X  f opt  X  X  1  X   X  f pec g X  9a  X  subject to A ij x i r b 3 j  X  X  1 2  X   X  X  b 3 j b 4 j  X  ; j  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; x i Z 0 ; i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; I 1  X  9f  X  y ih Z 0 ; i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; I 2 ; h  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; H  X  9g  X 
Through solving models (9), multiple uncertainties presented as fuzzy sets that exist in left-and right-hand sides of constraints and in objective function can be tackled. An eclectic f can be obtained based on inverse f opt and f pec by using  X  level, while a set of solutions associated with  X  and  X  levels for the objective function and decision variables can be obtained. 3. Case study
China, which is fl anked by the Tianshan Mountains to the north and by the Kunlun Mountains to the south ( Chen et al., 2007 ). Kaidu River and Kongque River are the branches of Tarim River formed from the middle of Tianshan Mountain to Lake Bositeng, which is about 610 km and 785 km long ( Huang et al., 2012 ). Kaidu-Kongque basin is situated in the Bayangol Mongol autonomous prefecture in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region of northwest China, which is approximately 62,000 km 2 . As the upper reach of the watershed, Kaidu River originates from Saaer mountain of the middle Tianshan Mountains, passes through Yourdusi basin, enters Yanqi basin, fl ows into Bosten Lake, then is pumped into Kongque River at southwest of the lake, crosses Kezile mountain of the south Tianshan Mountains, and reaches Tarim basin.

The study area is a typical arid region due to extremely dry climate, low and uneven distribution rainfall. The climate of basin is extremely dry with the average rainfall about 273 mm/year, which more than 80% of the total annual precipitation falls from May to September, and less than 20% of the total falls from November to April ( Huang et al., 2012 ). Therefore, the total water availability can be converted into several levels based on statistical analyses with the results of annual stream fl ow of the Kaidu-kongque River (as shown in Table 1 ). Since Kaidu-Kongque basin located in such a remote inland area, with an arid climate, little rainfall, intense evaporation and relatively poor water resources, water crisis was serious. Particular in recent year, water crisis was aggravated by its climatic change, population growth, agricultural exploration, and economic development. At the end of 2008, population of basin has exceeded one million spreading over six counties (i.e. Kuerle, Yanqi, Hejing, Heshuo, Bohu and Yuli), and the gross industrial and agricultural output value reached US$1.37 10 and US$0.98 10 9 . Accelerated rhythm of agriculture and industry has generated much larger water demand in study region, which put pressure on water resources management and hinder a sustainable development of the regional economy seriously. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective technique for forecasting or calculat-ing water demand accurately in the basin, which can support water resources planning and allocation water more ef fi ciently to relieve the pressure of water con fl icts.

Support vector regression (SVR) technique is useful for water demand prediction, which can assist decision makers to generate more practical and realistic results , particularly for water resources management systems associated with a variety of uncertainties and complexities ( Dai et al., 2011 ). SVR can reveal the regression relation-ship between water demand and input vector based on statistical/ machinelearningtheory( Morshed and Kaluarachchi, 1998; Vapnik, 1998; Smola and Sch X lkopf, 2000 ), as shown in Fig. 1 .Theimpact factors of water demand (e.g., pro fi ts, gross domestic product (GDP), water consumption, and income of unit volume water) are conducted to function of the input vector, which were generated future water demand by a good setting of regularization constant C ,precision parameter e and the kernel parameters ( Cherkassky and Ma, 2004 ). Moreover, the modeling approach included three quantitative simula-tion performance criteria that can help assess the prediction perfor-mance of SVR model ( Levis and Papageorgiou, 2005 ). There are a number of alternatives to assess the performance of the SVR model and the training algorithms, which included deviation of mean absolute deviate (MAD), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), and deviation of mean squared error (MSE). Since MAPE criterion is effective for comparing actual water demand values and predicted water demand values over the forecasting horizon time periods, and which is simple to operate, it is selected to assess the performance of the SVR model and the training algorithms as follows: (1) Prediction accuracy (PA) : derives from the mean absolute (2) Fitting accuracy (FA) : it is used to compare actual water (3) Over all accuracy (OA) : it is used to compare actual water demand In general, the strong and robust generalization ability and ability associated with the high PA and FA, respectively; the high OA represents the strong comprehensive ability over all time periods (both training and testing).

For the sake of acquiring the optimal water allocation pattern, amounts of water demand in the future should be obtained by the veri fi ed SVR model. In the process of predicting by SVR model, the data points from 2000 to 2008 are the training sets, while the data points from 2008 to 2011 can be regarded as the testing sets of SVR model ( The Statistical Year book of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in Uygur Autonomous Region, 2005-2011 ). The inputs of SVR model include increasing pro fi ts, income, GDP and other impact factors, which generate water demands in the future as outputs of prediction. Fig. 2 illustrates prediction results on water demand of by SVR, in which oil exploitation and cotton were selected as represen-tatives of industrial and agricultural users in Kaidu-kongque River Basin. Through entering input vector of oil exploitation (e.g., GDP, water deprivation per ten-thousand Yuan, amounts of reused water, and amounts of oil production) and cotton (e.g., planting area, gaining, income of cotton, and water consume of unit planting area), predictions of water demand can be generated by SVR model.
Under situations of incremental water demand and poor water resources, the water manager aims to allocate water to four users (i.e., municipal user, agricultural user, industrial user, and ecological user) of six districts effectively in response to remit con fl ict of water use. Appropriate decisions have been made by water manager based on water demand the users can expect (water target) on their various activities and investments. If the promised water is delivered, a net bene fi t to the local economy will be generated for each unit of water allocated; otherwise, either the water must be obtained from higher-priced alternatives or the dem and must be curtailed by reduced industrial and/or agricultural p roductions, resulting in a reduced system bene fi t. The economic data such as net bene fi tandlossof unit of water are estimated on regional statistical yearbook 2000 (as shown in Table 2 ). With the development of regional economy, a number of factors such as local inco me, industry development policy, fi nancial interest, and in fl ation rate, are considered into economic data expressed as fuzzy set. In the study area, water resources system could be considered as an interrelated network with complexities, which connected by various system components such as imprecise economic data, random stream fl ows, dynamic system variables, uncertain economic bene fi ts, various recourse actions, and varied water alloca-tions. These components and their interactions must be systematically investigated using an integrated water resources management model that incorporates TCP-HC and SVR techniques within a general framework, as shown in Fig. 1 . 4. Results analysis
In this study, since different credibility-satisfaction levels (i.e., and  X  levels) and Hurwicz parameters (i.e.,  X  -level) are introduced into TCP-CH, system bene fi ts with three levels can generate under different scenarios. Since credibility level should be greater than 0.5 and smaller than 1 ( Pishvaee et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013 ), and coef fi cient of optimism  X  should be greater than 0 and smaller than levels for  X  (i.e. from 0.6 to 0.9), and nine levels for  X  0.9) were considered, leading to a total of 144 scenarios. Fig. 3 provides the solutions of system bene fi ts ( f ) under 144 scenarios.
The results indicate that the system bene fi ts would be $2419 10 as the highest value and $1916 10 6 as the lowest one. Since coef fi cient of optimism (  X  )and f are positive presented in TCP-CH, f would increase with the  X  value, For example, f would vary from $2221 10 6 to $2360 10 6 when  X  is from 0.1 to 0.9. Meanwhile, since  X  -level is fuzzy credibility measure in the constraint of water availability, a higher  X  level would lead to a higher water shortage but a lower water allocation. Therefore, it is indicated that f would decrease as the  X  level is raised. For example, f would be from $2221 10 6 to $1960 10 6 when  X  ranges from 0.6 to 0.9. Besides, the system bene fi ts would increase with  X  level when  X  is from 0.1 to 0.4, while decrease when  X  is from 0.6 to 0.9. Since an compromised f have been acquired based on inverse optimistic and pessimistic system bene fi ts (i.e., f opt and f pec ), f impact f indirectly. When  X  is from 0.6 to 0.9, f opt plays a decisive role in f ; and that negative relationships between  X  level and f leads f would decrease with  X  level. While positive relationships between  X  level and f pec would generate opposite results when from 0.1 to 0.4.
 system bene fi ts (i.e., f opt and f pec ) under 144 scenarios, which indicates that various credibility-satisfaction levels and Hurwicz parameters generated immense changes in the system bene fi
Since f opt represents optimistic decision for system bene the Hurwicz criterion; while f pec is pessimistic one for system bene fi t as shown in Fig. 4 , the f opt value would increase with the level, while f pec would decrease with the  X  level. For example, the solutions of f opt would be from $222 10 6 to $2360 10 6 when is from 0.1 to 0.9; whereas f pec would be from $1998 10 6 $212 10 6 . Moreover, the results indicate that f opt and f changed with the value of  X  . Since  X  -level is conducted as the fuzzy credibility measure in the constraint of water availability, which re fl ects relationship between con fi dence degree and viola-tion degree of fuzzy water availability, f opt and f pec would decrease as  X  level is raised. For example, when  X  -levels are from 0.6 to 0.9, values of f opt and f pec would be from $222 10 6 to $196 10 $1999 10 6 to $1772 10 6 , respectively. It is indicated that a higher  X  level for water availability would lead to a decreased f opt and f pec ; however, this decrease corresponded to a dropped risk level in water resources planning system.
 shortages of four users in six counties are obtained. Water shortages would occur if the available water resource could not meet the regulated target, which indicate that the shortage is the difference between the target and water availability. In study basin, water targets often has been determined before total water in fl ows was known, which generated a recourse water allocation problem cased by variations between targets and water availabil-ities. Based on different credibility-satisfaction levels, water shortages of 4 users in 6 districts in study basin under cases 1 and 7 are shown in Fig. 7 . Solutions indicate that the water shortages would be in fl uenced by the randomness in the total water availabilities. For example, when water fl ows in wet season, water target could easily be satis fi ed, which leads that water shortage is less than that in dry season. Moreover, shortages are in fl uenced by  X  -level, since  X  -level is fuzzy credibility measure in the constraint of water availability. The highest water shortages would be achieved under case 7 (i.e.,  X   X  0.9), which indicate that a higher  X  -levels would lead a higher water shortage; by decreasing of  X  -levels, water shortages would drop under case 1 (i.e., For example, water shortage of municipal users in Yanqi county ( j  X  2) would be 3.55 10 6 m 3 at low level, 3.27 10 6 m medium level, and 2.19 10 6 m 3 at high level under case 7; while it would be 3.20 10 6 m 3 at low level, 2.92 10 6 m 3 at medium level and 2.37 10 6 m 3 at high level under case 1. Meanwhile, -levels have little effected on water shortages, since  X  is satisfac-tion levels of the constraints only in fl uenced unit bene
Fig. 8 shows the results of optimal water allocations for municipal, agricultural, industrial, and ecological users in the six counties of the study basin under cases 1 and 7. Results indicate that shortage in water supply would be generated if the pre-regulated target could not be satis fi ed (i.e., shortage  X  targeted value available in fl ow). Under such a situation, the actual water allocation would be the difference between the pre-regulated target and the probabilistic shortage (i.e., actual alloca-tion  X  optimized target shortage). Each allocated water fl was the difference between the promised target and the probabil-istic shortage under a given stream condition with an associated probability level, which indicate that different violation levels would result in varied water-allocation patterns. For example, under case 1, the optimized targets of municipal, agricultural, industrial, and ecological users (in Bohu county, j  X  5) would be 4.95 10 6 m 3 , 97.75 10 6 m 3 , 21.85 10 6 m 3 and 28.75 10 respectively. When in fl ow was high, shortages would be 1.28 10 6 m 3 ,12.11 10 6 m 3 , 2.55 10 6 m 3 , and 7.06 10 correspondingly, the actual allocations would be 4.75 10 6 93.93 10 6 m 3 ,19.30 10 6 m 3 , 19.29 10 6 m 3 . The total amount of allocated water to Bohu county would be from 127.42 10 6 m 137.27 10 6 m 3 ; however, its total water demand would be 153.3 10 6 m 3 , indicating that there would be shortage even though the in fl ow is high. Due to more than 80% of the total annual precipitation falls from May to September in study region, water falls in other months were much less. Therefore, when in fl ows were middle or low, the shortage would be strengthened, whereas each user would have to obtain water from other sources to satisfy its essential demands. binations of the fuzzy sets, which achieved different water availabilities, water targets, and varied water-allocations. The results indicate that a higher credibility-satisfaction level would generate a higher water de fi ciency and a lower water allocation; otherwise it would produce an opposite results (as shown in
Fig. 8 ). For example, optimized targets of municipal users in Hejing county ( j  X  3) would be 4.30 10 6 m 3 under cases 1 and 7. When in fl ow is low, shortages and actual allocations would be 0.65 10 6 m 3 and 3.65 10 6 m 3 under case 1 (i.e.,  X   X  0.6); while they would be 0.69 10 6 m 3 and 3.61 10 6 m 3 under case 7 (i.e.,  X   X  0.9). In comparison, water allocation with higher is smaller than that with lower  X  -level, since higher  X  -levels leads higher credibility-satisfactions and lower violation risks in water planning system, which generates higher water de fi ciencies and lower water allocations. 5. Discussion and Hurwicz parameters (i.e.,  X  -level) are important parameters to express fuzzy relationship in TCP-CH, which can affect water allocation and system bene fi ts enormously, they are considered the key parameters in this study. In response to comparing water allocations and system bene fi ts variation distinctly based on
TCP-HC, eight cases based on extreme values of credibility-satisfaction levels (i.e.  X   X  0.6 and 0.9,  X   X  0.6 and 0.9) and Hurwicz Scenario Scenario parameters (i.e.  X   X  0.1 and 0.9) are considered in Table 3 , which can also support analyzing interaction of these parameters. Since ,  X  and  X  levels are conducted as effect factors in water resources management, the sum effect of three parameters and their inter-action would in fl uence system bene fi ts. Therefore, factorial analy-sis is conducted for examining the effects of different credibility-satisfaction levels and Hurwicz parameters for objective function and constraints. To assess the main and interactive effects, we have E  X  2  X  Contrast x  X  SS where E x is the standardized effect of a factor or multi-factor interaction; Contrast x is calculated by using plus and minus signs in column x , which can be obtained from the Yates' order table (Box et al., 1978; Montgomery, 2001; Montgomery and Runger, 2003); SS x is the sum of squares of factor x or multi-factor interaction. The 2 k p fractional factorial design allows 2 k p 1 effects and their aliases to be analyzed.

The effects of three factors and their sum of squares are acquired (as shown in Table 3 ), which can support revealing the potential interrelationships among a variety of uncertain para-meters and their impacts on system performance. Table 4 shows the standardized effects and sum of squares for signi fi cant factors and interactions. The results indicate that factor  X  level would contribute more than 63.87% in system's performance and have the largest effect. Fig. 5 shows each main effect of  X  ,  X  independently, which indicate that the slope of  X  level is positive to system bene fi t; while  X  -and  X  -levels are negative to system bene fi ts. Among of them,  X  level has the steepest slope, implying that this parameter is most in fl uential; in other words, the variation of  X  -level would have most signi fi cant effects on system performance. In comparison, the slopes of  X  and  X  levels are negative, demonstrating their negative effects on the system performance. Fig. 6 shows the effects of  X  and  X  levels interactions, which indicates a higher  X  level would generate a decreased system bene fi t; while a higher  X  -level would lead to an increased system bene fi t. Since the effects of  X  and  X  levels are negative, it leads the interactions of two factors neutralizing. Under these situations, the slopes of  X  -and  X  -levels are mainly positive when and  X  levels are lower; while the slopes are negative by increasing of  X  level and  X  . For example, when the slopes of  X  level (e.g., $2221 10 6 to $1969 10 6 ) and  X  level (e.g., $2221 10 6 to $2161 10 6 ) are positive at lower  X  -level; while they are negative at higher  X  level (e.g.,  X  -level were from $2161 10 6 to $1916 10 6 and  X  level were from $2362 10 6 to $2416 10 6 6. Conclusions with Hurwicz criterion (TCP-CH) has been developed for water resources management under uncertainty. The developed TCP-CH can deal with multiple uncertainties expressed as probability distributions and fuzzy sets in water resources allocation problems resulting from randomness in water availabilities; it also can promote capacities of fuzzy determination to offer a compromised decision by Hurwicz criterion in water resources management.
Three special contributions in the study make it unique compared with the previous water resources management and planning methods. Firstly, TCP-CH can deal with uncertainties presented fuzzy sets that exist in left-and right-hand sides of constraints and in objective function. Secondly, the SVR technique is introduced into TCP-CH to simulate and predict water demand as the input of optimization model; which can help identify the effects of several critical factors (e.g., population, income, consumption, and economy) on water demand as well as water resources manage-ment practice. It provides a linkage between SVR and optimization techniques, which can not only predict the water demand, but also re fl ect dynamic, interactive, and uncertain characteristics of the water resources management system. Thirdly, factorial analysis is used to investigate the potential interactions among different parameters and their in fl uences on solutions, which is meaningful for supporting an in-depth analysis of uncertainty in water resources management.
The developed method has been applied to a real case of planning water resources management in Kaidu-kongque River Basin, where is a typical water-de fi cient region with the charac-teristics of dry climate, low and uneven distribution rainfall. With the aid of the model, several fi ndings can be disclosed based on the results in terms of regional water resources plans and risk patterns.

Firstly, results discover that severe water de fi cit due to char-acteristic of aridity has brought negative effects on regional social-economic development in these region. Particularly, agricultural production considered as the largest water conservation were encountering most severe water de fi cit (e.g., maximum water de fi cit reached 96.30 10 6 m 3 at low level of water availabilities), which generate enormous losses in water resources management system. The losses are caused by several reasons such as unrea-sonable water plans, inef fi cient water usage (e.g., behindhand irrigation regime) and unscienti fi c risk option. Secondly, it dis-cover that risk preference of decision makers in decision process with uncertain importations can affect water allocation, which support decision makers making neither adventurous nor con-servative decisions in water resources planning. Water de be lessened by introducing rational satisfaction levels, optimistic/ pessimistic criterion (e.g., decrement of water de fi cit of agricul-tural section reached 4.79%), which can promote system bene in a certain extent. Thirdly, the irrigation regime and water saving technology of this region is relative backward, which generate more inef fi cient water usage. Correspondingly, the speci tions to the authorities can be summarized as follows: Firstly, adjustment of local water-user structure and improvement of water-use ef fi ciency could lessen water de fi cits and promote system bene fi ts, as well as satisfying the local increasing water demand. Secondly, more consciousness of risk should be consid-ered into decision making process, which could enhance the reliability and rationality of water resources plans. Thirdly, advanced irrigation regime and water saving technology (e.g., drop irrigation) should be recommended to further improve ef fi ciency of agricultural water usage.

Although the developed TCP-CH model can effectively deal with uncertainties existing in the water resources management and planning problems, there are also several limitations of the proposed method that are subject to further improvement. For example, in the practical water resources management problems, multiple uncertainties (e.g., random in water availability, varied water demand, imprecise economic data, different allocation target) generate complex uncertainties and various risks in water resources system, which affect ef fi ciency of water policies of satisfactions and optimistic/pessimistic criterion for water resources planning. Therefore, in future research, TCP-CH would be integrated with robust optimization techniques to enhance its capacities in tackling uncertainties presented in multiple formats, as well as improving of its practical application to regional water resources planning. Meanwhile, increasing water demands and the inadequate water supplies have exacerbated the water shortage, which have brought adverse impacts on the economic develop-ment of the arid region. Problems involving the ef fi cient allocation of limited water resources have challenged the local authority, which would require more effective methods to overcome them. On the one hand, more advanced intelligence algorithm such as arti fi cial neural network model (ANN) and genetic programming (GP) would be employed to improve the accuracy of prediction of water demand in the future, which could promote abilities of water resources planning. On the other hand, more advanced water-saving technologies (e.g., water retreatment technologies, drop-irrigation technologies and step price of water) would be recommended to further improve water usage ef fi ciency, which could remit water crisis extremely.
