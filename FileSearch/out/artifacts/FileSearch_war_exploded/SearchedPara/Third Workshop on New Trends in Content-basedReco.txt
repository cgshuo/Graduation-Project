 While content-based recommendation has been applied success-fully in many different domains, it has not seen the same level of attention as collaborative filtering techniques have. However, there are many recommendation domains and applications where content and metadata play a key role, either in addition to or instead of ratings and implicit usage data. For some domains, such as movies, the relationship between content and usage data has seen thorough investigation already, but for many other domains, such as books, news, scientific articles, and Web pages we still do not know if and how these data sources should be combined to provided the best recommendation performance. The CBRecSys 2016 workshop provides a dedicated venue for papers dedicated to all aspects of content-based recommendation.
Content-based recommendation has been applied successfully in many different domains [9, 7], yet it has not seen the same level of attention as collaborative filtering techniques have. In the past decade, competitions like the Netflix Prize 1 , CAMRA 2 , and the Yahoo! Music KDD Cup 2011 [8] have spurred on advances in collaborative filtering and how to utilize ratings and usage data. However, there are many recommendation domains and applications where content and metadata play a key role, either in addition to or instead of ratings and implicit usage data. For some domains, such as movies, the relationship between content and usage data has seen thorough investigation already (e.g. [10]), but for many other domains, such as books, news, scientific articles, and Web pages we still do not know if and how these data sources should be http://www.netflixprize.com/ http://www.dai-labor.de/camra2010/
A total of 14 papers were submitted to the workshop, which were all reviewed by a program committee of international experts in the field.

Nine of these papers were accepted for presentation at the work-shop for an acceptance rate of 64%. Several papers focus on using machine learning approaches for content-based recommendation, such as deep learning and learning-to-rank. Other papers present hybrid systems combining collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation, as well as a variety of different features, such as sentiment, temporal, and visual features. Like in previous years, some of the accepted papers focus on using semantic resources such as Linked Open Data to improve the effectiveness of content-based recommender algorithms. The nine accepted papers span a breadth of different domains, such as movies, Linked Open Data, news articles, research papers, e-commerce.
The workshop material (list of accepted papers, invited talk, and the workshop schedule) can be found on the CBRecSys 2016 work-shop website at http://cbrecsys2016.aau.dk . The proceedings are published as a CEUR Workshop Proceedings volume, a link to which can be found on the workshop website. Similar to last years X  workshops [2, 6], we will also look into publishing a sum-mary of the workshop in venues like the SIGIR Forum, to increase cross-disciplinary awareness of recommender systems research.
