 and place and the unavoidable consequences, whereas an activity is a connected set of which often occur at a specific time and specific place [2, 11]. 
Time information has been used in TDT. Based on the observation that articles re-porting on a particular event tend to appear within a time window of two weeks, for clustering [9]. More recent approaches attempted to automatically extract time infor-described in an article refers to the event being tracked [7,10]. it has neither been used nor tested extensively for TDT. Possible reasons are: -Some time information such as publication dates is easily available from news -Time information is one-dimensional and thus relatively easy to represent and -Although time information extraction needs to deal with ambiguity to some 
Despite the relative difficulty of extracting and normalizing place information, ad-vances in related techniques such as named entity recognition make our research not on the techniques for extracting place information, we use exiting techniques and resources for place name recognition. For instance, we made use of some portal sites for determining the semantic relationship between two place names. 
Assuming that place information can be extracted from news article text, we con-centrate on the way we use the information for topic tracking in this paper. For effec-tive use of place information, it is important to understand the characteristics observ-able in an event description. For instance, the place name as well as the time informa-giving different weights for place names occurring in different parts of a new article, for example, we can increase the chance to associate a place name with an event. In this paper, we describe four different characteristics of place names, incorporate them tracking experiments. In sum, the contributions made in the research are as follows: tion is used. -We developed a novel event tracking method using place information extracted automatically, which incorporates the characteristics explicitly. observed characteristics. name recognition and extraction has been around for many years, especially with the need to fill a pre-defined template by extracting information from text and to answer questions involving place information. For example, research on distinguishing place MUC(Message Understanding Conference)-6 [13]. With the goal of better utilizing  X  X ity X ,  X  X ountry X ,  X  X egion X , and  X  X ater X  was reported [4,5,8]. Categorization of place names helps determining whether two names refer to the same location. For instance, tagging a place name  X  X eneva, New York X  with [location] and [location], respec-tively, is less useful than tagging them with [city] and [state], since the latter can tell the relationship between  X  X eneva, New York X  and  X  X ew York X  with the aid of a place entity hierarchy. In other words, for example,  X  X he accident in the state of New York X  and  X  X he accident in Geneva X  may be considered the same event with a detailed place name tagging. 
A few papers address the issue of using place information to improve effectiveness unstructured history documents, not news paper articles. Documents containing the same dates and places, which were identified by named entity recognition, were con-sidered as describing the same historical event. Juha et al. [6] extracted person names, places, temporal expressions, and general terms to form four vectors, each represent-ing one of the four types. The similarity between two documents was computed based on four vectors that were treated with the equal weights in computing similarities and ments of the vector. reporting on events and activities, by analyzing Chosunilbo news articles in 2002. The purpose of this analysis was to improve on the straightforward way of treating place names as terms in event tracking. In other words, we felt that the unique characteris-tics of occurrences of place names in news articles should be taken into consideration when we develop a method for event tracking. 3.1 Concentration on a Short Time Window tinue for a while, mostly within two weeks. As a result, a place name for an event also tend to share the same pattern. appears that a bunch of articles are published during the first five days. By the end of two weeks, the number of related articles becomes almost zero. Of course, the number of articles varies depending on the importance of the event. Each occurrence of a place name can potentially serve as a piece of evidence for the goes by, however, the place name may refer to a different event that occurred in the same place at a different time. 3.2 Decreasing Levels of Detail time of the event and become simpler often at a higher level of abstraction. For exam-ple,  X  X ire on A Street, Albany, New York X  is referred to as  X  X ire on D street X  (a sim-pler form) or  X  X ire in Albany X  (a simper form at a higher level of abstraction) at a later time. 
Based on our analysis of news articles, we found that only 69% of the articles con-and 8% have no place name. 
In order to take advantage of this tendency, we should be able to form an equiva-lence class of place names for a particular event. For example,  X  X ire in Albany X  can be an exact match with an event description like  X  X ire on D Street, Albany, New York X  if the place name hierarchy verifies that Albany is a city in the state of New York. How-ever, a description like  X  X ire on Elm Street, Albany X  should be interpreted as referring to a different event because the street names conflict each other in the same city. 3.3 Locations of Place Names It was observed that a majority of place names for the main event occur at the begin-ning of news articles. This tendency is similar to the fact that the first sentence of an because it is a key element in describing the main thrust of the event being reported. Place names occur in later sentences, too, but they usually refer to other related events rather than the main event being described in the article. 
Fig. 2 depicts the tendency described above. As shown in the graph, the majority of mation when we develop an algorithm for handling multiple occurrences of place names in a single article. That is, the place names appearing at the beginning part of an article would be more likely to be related to the main event of the article. 3.4 The Number of Place Names in an Article chance it describes an event. That is, an event article tends to have only a small num-ber of place names because it would mention a place name for the event without mak-ing references to other places. first describe how place names were identified, extracted, and canonicalized, and then explain how place name-based similarity was computed between a target class and a news article. Finally we show how the total score was computed between a class and a news article. 4.1 Place Name Extraction from News Paper Text Place names are not always extractable unambiguously because a word or phrase can be a place name, organization name, or a person name depending on the contexts. For example,  X  X ashington X  can refer to a person, a state, or a city. Since there is no con-cept of capital letters in Korean, it is not easy to distinguish proper nouns from gen-the stem of a verb, (Booyuh-Hada) although their meanings are not related at all. 
We used the named entity recognizer (NER) [8] borrowed from ETRI to automati-name tags: COUNTRY, PROVINCE, CITY, CAPITALCITY, COUNTY, CONTINENT, MOUNTAIN, OCEAN, RIVER, ISLAND, TOPOGRAPHY, CANYON, and BAY. The NER tagger accepts a news article and tags each place name with one of the 13 place names. The performance of the NER tagger was known to be 81.8 % in F measure. 4.2 Canonicalization and Place Hierarchy Once place names have been recognized and tagged with the labels, at least two prob-lems need to be handled before they are used for event tracking. Since the actual de-scriptions of a place name in news articles may change as time goes by, the extracted example, (Gabokdong) is used as the name of the specific area for an accident, but (Goonsan city), the name of the city that covers the specific place, may be used in a later article referring to the same accident. In this case, the hierarchical rela-tionship between the two place names must be established so that they are treated as referring to the same region as far as the accident is concerned. 
The second issue is related with abbreviated form of place names, which are used known event. For example, a province name (Chonbuk) is a short form for ary. We call this process as canonicalization. As a way to handle these issues, we utilized resources available on the Web. Some locations in Korea. They accept a place name as a query and return its canonicalized form (full name) and its super-region and sub-regions, together with other information about the place such as restaurants, motels, banks, etc. Fig. 3 shows the overall proc-ess where a place name extracted by the named entity recognizer is used as the query form of the place name and hierarchically related place names. 4.3 Similarity Calculation Using Place Names Given canonicalized place names and hierarchically related names, the next step is to incorporate the place information into the event tracking process per se. A news arti-cles mentioned in Section 3. Similarity Based on a Place Name Hierarchy Given a hierarchy of place names, news articles may use names at different levels of names only. Similarity between n t , the target event place name, and n d , a place name in a news article, is defined to be: where |.| is the size of a place name, i.e. the number of name units. For example, if the this and the place name in a new article  X  X lbany X  becomes 1/3. While  X  X lbany, New actually refers to the city in New York, the former has a higher similarity value of 2/3 according to the formula. We believe this reflects that  X  X lbany X  without the specific state name carries some uncertainty, resulting in a smaller similarity value. It should target event and the place name in the article do not match. For example,  X  X  Street in Albany, New York X  does not match with  X  X lm Street, Albany, New York, X  resulting in a conflect. Using the Position of Place Names news articles. This information is likely to determine whether the place name is actu-degree of certainty that a place name refers to the main event in an article as follows: where d is the news article where the place name appears and Pos(n d ) is the position mum value being 1. Calculating Coherence of Place Names specific event. We compute the degree of coherence of a place name with respect to an event as follows: all place names in the article.  X  is a constant determined by experiments. For the work reported in this article, we used 0.5. 4.4 Combining Three Features information, position feature, and coherence feature need to be combined to affect the final similarity value. Since the place name similarity with hierarchical information is the most crucial for matching, we use it as the basis and try to adjust it by considering the two feature values. Following is the heuristics we used: 
If ) , ( d t h n n Sim = 1.0 and 
If 0.5 &lt; ) , ( d t h n n Sim &lt; 0.8 and Otherwise, final Sim =) , ( d t h n n Sim . The first case was based on our observation that even thought the matching between two place names is perfect, there is a chance that the one in a news article may not be such a case, the overall similarity value for place names should be lowered. The sec-ond case was developed to boost the final similarity based on place names when the location and coherence feature values are high enough. 4.5 Final Similarity tained by combining the content similarity ( Sim content ) and place-based similarity val-ues as follows: where 6 . 0 =  X  and 4 . 0 =  X  . model. The news articles were processed with the standard indexing method including stemming, removal of stop words, and TF-IDF to compute the weights of terms. In order to test our initial hypothesis that place information would help improving the Chosunilbo, which has the largest number of subscribers in Korea. them as events for which event tracking would be done. For each event, relevant arti-cles were pre-selected by people and used for evaluation of system-generated output. ments for each documents were made by two people after reading the articles. Table 1 shows a sample of event topics and the number of  X  X nswer X  documents. 5.1 Evaluation of Place Name Features through (3) in Section 4. This set of experiments would help us finalize our method of combining pieces of evidence coming from different aspects of place information and test our initial hypotheses based on the characteristics of place names in news articles. 
We came up with four different cases beyond the baseline that is just based on con-tent similarity. The first three are for the three different formulas and the fourth one is for a combination of the three. In addition, we implemented the method used in [6] to validate our approaches. Following are all the cases compared: -Baseline: event tracking based on topical content only -Case A: Baseline + use of hierarchical information of place names -Case B: Baseline + position of place names -Case C: Baseline + coherence of place names -Case D: A + B + C -Case E: the method in [6] some contribution and the combination of the three features gave a 7.27% of im-show some potential. Even the relatively low performance increases in Cases C and D attest to their values when combined with others. It should be noted that the previous approach in [6] gives performance increase almost identical to that of individual fea-tures as in the last row of the table. A conclusion we can draw from the experiments is that it is worthwhile using various features of place names based on their characteris-tics and take them into consideration when place information is used in combination with the content of articles. 5.2 Evaluation with Place and Time Information dates and time information automatically extracted from text as in [7], we investigated three different cases: Case 1: Use of both place and time information (extracted from text) Case 2: Use of publication dates (time information only) Case 3: Use of both place information and publication dates Case 4: Use of both extracted time and publication dates (time information only) Case 5: Use all the three kinds of information As in Table 3, the result shows that when combined with place information, publica-news paper text. Comparing Case2 and Case 3, adding place information improved shows a slightly less improvement. We feel that the amounts of improvement over the use of time information is not as great as expected, perhaps due to the inaccuracies of place name recognition. Nonetheless, by using all the three types of information as in significant improvement. 5.3 Success and Failure Analyses name features in performance increases, we analyzed their roles in some events. Big-gest improvements were possible when the place information in the target events was provement was more than 30% with the event containing  X  name. 
However, the event tracking task for some events was negatively influenced by our method as in Table 4. The first two below are the problems caused by place name ambiguities, and the third one is caused by the difficulty of even extracting place information.. -Similar events occurred in the same place respectively should be separated and fallen into two different event categories. How-similar, increasing the possibility that they are classified into the same event category. sub-events of a large event like Olympic Games, because the place where the games given too big a weight. -The place name not specified or fixed Although two articles mention the same event, the place name found in the text may be too generic like  X   X  (North Korean Navy X  X  attack in the West Sea ). The place name West Sea is too general, and at the same time, the region could be referred to in other articles with different names like NIT or Northern Boundary. -Not easy to extract a place name When the place name is part of the event name, it is difficult to extract it, because the place name is concatenated with other words without any spacing. Unless such a complex noun is decomposed into simple nouns, the current named entity recognizer will never find the place name. For instance, the word  X   X  (Cannes) in the event title  X   X  (awards in Cannes Film Festival) is the place where the film festival was held, but since the first four syllables are considered a single word, it is not pos-sible to extract the place name unless noun segmentation is done first. We addressed the issues related to using place names that appear in news paper arti-names from news articles and treat them as elements of vectors, we attempted to use a kind of concept hierarchy specialized in place names for partial matching and charac-tics we also reported in this paper. 
We ran experiments to evaluate the amount of contributions made by the individual features of place names and to test whether using place information in addition to the topical content and time information used in previous research for topic tracking. We concluded that more careful use of place names indeed improve effectiveness of event dressed in the future. 
With the proposed method proven to be promising, we plan to apply the same method to English collections. Since place name recognition is likely to be easier and nouns, we expect to see more dramatic improvements. We also intend to find a more principled way to apply various insights and heuristics in incorporating feature values and computing similarities.
