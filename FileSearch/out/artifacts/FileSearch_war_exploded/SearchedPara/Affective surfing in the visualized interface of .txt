 1. Introduction
Natural curiosity and the need to satisfy emotional desires have been shown to motivate children to search for informa-tion ( Bilal, 2005; Cooper, 2002; Martens, 2012; Shenton &amp; Dixon, 2004; Walter, 1994 ). For example, Druin (2005, p. 30) explained that children often seek books using keywords such as  X  X  X appy X  X  or  X  X  X cary X  X  to match their affective states.
Children require information seeking (IS) skills as well as a suitable interface to help them find the information they need
Nakashima, 2012; Nesset &amp; Large, 2004 ). Researchers in human X  X omputer interaction (HCI) have investigated children X  X  interaction with virtual representations in order to make learning easier and more pleasurable ( Allison, Wills, Bowman,  X 
Researchers in IS behavior and computing research are well aware of the role played by affective play in interaction with 2004; Van Schaik &amp; Ling, 2012; Wilson, 1999; Zhang, 2008 ). Concepts such as the virtual world (VW) have recently been introduced to the design of interfaces aimed at helping children seeking information ( Wu, Tang, &amp; Tsai, 2014; Beheshti, 2012; Dubroy, 2010 ). Understanding how playing and learning needs affect children X  X  choices when interacting with VW interfaces for the retrieval of information. 2. Relevant literatures
Researchers in children X  X omputer interaction have designed software for young children to support learning through software such as word processors and internet browsers, entertainment software that includes game and media products, and educational software that is either linked to a curriculum or designed for assessing special skills. Though most educa-problem is how to make software  X  X  X un X  X  and thus stimulate learning interest in children. Many related studies have explored fun and the problem of usability, virtual worlds, and IS behavioral issues. 2.1. Fun and usability problem
Sim, MacFarlane, and Read (2006, p. 235) empirically studied fun, usability, and learning in educational software and found that  X  X (for the tested software), learning was not correlated with fun or usability X  X , but  X  X  X bserved fun and observed usability were correlated (with each other). X  X  Though Sim et al. (2006) demonstrated that children appeared to have less dren digital libraries would have any effect on their levels of enjoyment.

Bilal (2002a) collaborated with children as design partners in developing prototype interfaces of Web search engines. All of the children X  X  prototype drawings had educational and entertainment information, indicating that children desired to apply the engines to seek information for schoolwork as well as play game. Thus, children may treat a retrieval interface
The way in which children have fun while searching for information and issues they may encounter with usability are topics worthy of further research. 2.2. Virtual worlds
Virtual worlds (VW), defined as three-dimensional interactive environments where users may participate through their
Ryan and Deci (2000) explained that the intrinsic motives of those intending to use the designed VW system are to create a pleasurable experience and provide self-fulfilling value. Gradually, VWs have started to shift to an instrumental role by enabling their users to perform rather utilitarian tasks, such as buying financial services, participate in courses, and Matzler, 2011; Mennecke et al., 2008; Shelton, 2010 ).
 403) designed SearchKids including the search options of a virtual zoo that children recognize images of animals to access media, a world area for children browsing the animal database by geographical criteria and a search area that provides func-dren using the metaphor of a physical library with reading rooms, bookcases, and books. Search results are displayed as red dots on the floor plan of a library.
 2010 ). They can also increase learner motivation and positively impact on the cognitive load associated with the processing of information ( Huang, 2011 ).

Most virtual interfaces use icons to represent operations (i.e., searching). Information visualization theory purports that
Koshman (2006, p. 206) analyzed iconic representations and metaphors of icon layout in visualization systems used for information retrieval, and suggested that such systems provide users  X  X  X ore visual and temporal control over the informa-tion displayed. X  X  Leide, Large, Beheshti, and Brooks (2003, p. 937) developed a visual navigation classification scheme for domain novices (i.e. children). When novices search for information, they have specific directions but they do not have a specific search target. During the search, he/she will change his/her point of view based on what he/she has found, thereby establishing a specific knowledge map and modifying his/her search target and range. These novices have no special training face based on navigation experience is used to help users build mind maps. Comparing the mind knowledge map with the information they receive while searching for information produces uncertainty in the mind of the user regarding the means to navigate the visual space of the domain knowledge map (see Fig. 1 ). However, these uncertainties have not yet been explored. 2.3. IS behavior
IS has been shown to influence learning. Marchionini (1995) suggested that learning and information-seeking are closely related and partially overlapping processes, both of which alter the individual state of knowledge. Kuhlthau (2004) consid-ered learning as a process of construction that engages all aspects of an individual X  X  experience. She stated that negative affect, such as uncertainty, could stimulate users to be less willing to remain interacting with an information system because of the challenge, motivation, and increases in self-confidence. Ozcelik, Cagiltay, and Ozcelik (2013) revealed that uncertainty enhances learning.

Tenopir, Wang, Zhang, Simmons, and Pollard (2008) suggested that search strategies and tasks induce negative feelings, whereas the use of a digital library when using effective navigation systems can produce positive feelings are associations. Furthermore, smaller collections of information can produce negative feelings and uncertainty about using the system.
Chowdhury, Gibb, and Landoni (2011) evaluated uncertainty in information seeking and retrieval (IS&amp;R) in academic environments, and found that the relationship between uncertainty and the formulation of search processes is non-linear and complex and increasing the number of information channels significantly increases the uncertainty associated with trast to negative/undesirable uncertainty and their impacts on the IS&amp;R process. X  X 
Bilal and Kirby (2002) observed different IS behaviors and user experiences among adults and children. Adults employed advanced search syntax, but children did not. Adults applied a linear or systematic browsing style whereas children had a targets whereas most children did. Adults could quickly recover from breakdowns in keyword searches, whereas children
Shenton and Dixon (2004) claimed that children differ from adults in controlling IS behavior: they tend to expend mini-mum effort to find sufficient information, they apply the same method repeatedly, they select a search strategy at the point of need, and they apply untaught, expedient IS methods. Children X  X  IS behavior involves self-exploration of an uncertain
The reviewed studies illustrate aspects of the IS behavior of children and their affective states; however, there remains a lack of understanding related to the design of usable and fun/enjoyable interfaces when applying the concept of VW to a digital library. For children, it may be decomposed into two new dimensions, one is information need included of playing (diversionary) and learning (solving problem), and the other is affective state included of uncertainty and sense of control information gap regarding children X  X  need for information and their affective states. We also suggest a model that may be used to investigate what VW retrieval interfaces children prefer (choose) when searching for information for entertainment or problem-solving, the mixed affective states of uncertainty, and ease of use that they require. An understanding of how children use the VW interface as a toy and tool at the same time could facilitate the development of fun educational software. 2.4. Research model
Although this study focuses on the relationships between Affective State, VW Retrieval Interface, and Information Need literature review. 2.4.1. Observed variables of information need
As this study examines the relationship between Information Need and Interface Media, the studies of interface usability and the intention underlying the information-seeking behavior of children must be reviewed. Carroll (2004) suggested that the concept of usability should be extended to include fun. Massey, Weeks, and Druin (2005) also used fun to measure chil-dren X  X  responses to literature in a digital library. Gurland and Glowacky (2011) , who discussed theories of motivation for children, noted that children were most interested in the rewards strategy. O X  X rien and Toms (2008) discussed user engage-ment, established a conceptual framework for defining user engagement with technology, and made  X  X  X merging X  X  one def-inition of engagement. In addition, Amichai-Hamburger, Kaynar, and Fine (2007) asserted that individuals with a low
Thus, the observed variables for the latent variable of Entertainment Information Need (EN) are fun (Funy), motivation (Moti), engagement (Enag), and attention (Aten), whereas those of Problem-Solving Information Need (PS) are informative (Ifmv) and useful (Usfl). 2.4.2. Observed variables of VW retrieval interface
People frequently recognize a picture with a single glance and understand text and sound based on recognizing each com-ponent individually across a time sequence. Tzeng (2004) examined users X  responses to apologies for a computer game fail-ure expressed through text and designed icons. Apologetic (sad) icons communicated more effectively than pure text. In addition, Bilal and Bachir (2007) underlined the importance of  X  X epresentations X  and  X  X eaning X  in information searches undertaken by non-native English-speaking children when using the International Children X  X  Digital Library (ICDL). Thus, the carrying of concept and expression of meaning are important functions of an icon in a graphic interface. Hu, Ma, and
Chau (1999) suggested that  X  X  X ize X  X  and  X  X  X istance X  X  may provide numerous effective and essential visual cues in communica-tion of concepts from systems to users. While demonstrating that information visualizations support knowledge acquisition,
Keller, Gerjets, Scheiter, and Garsoffky (2006) indicated that 2D information visualizations support knowledge acquisition processes better than 3D information visualizations. Hourcade (2002, p. 5) claimed that sizing visual targets appropriately ments and road signs, and text recognition is widely used in content-based image indexing and the retrieval of video e.g. a VW. Mandarin Chinese is encoded in a morphological format. When readers move their eyes across the text, visual nificantly influence interface functions.

Taiwanese children in their first year of primary school must learn the Chinese phonetic alphabet, and the written pho-netic alphabet then helps these children recognize the meanings of words. Br X ck, Kreifelts, and Wildgruber (2011) analyzed how humans extract information from voice tone. When children trigger an icon that initiates an audio narration, they are using a multimedia channel to receive information, which also helps them obtain information. Thus, the observed variables scene cue (Sncu), concept carried (Cpcy), and graphic expression (Grep). 2.4.3. Observed variables of affective state
Interface Media and Affective State are causally related, explaining why the observed variables of Affective State are based on investigations of the comments and feelings of children regarding their interface use.
 Many existing instruments have been developed to measure anxiety and uncertainty, such as the Scale for Intolerance of previous research has focused on goodness of fit in either therapeutic psychology or the study of personality. This study focused on children in a state of uncertainty of unknowing when using a VW retrieval interface. We adopted some of the in advance in for the development of a scale specific to the context of this study.
 Several studies have assessed systems that communicate effect using emotionally expressive computer agents. Brave,
Nass, and Hutchinson (2005) examined how emotionally expressive computer agents affect user perceptions of a computer pants adopt an  X  X  X xhaustive X  X  approach when seeking two-dimensional (2D) node arrangements and a  X  X  X ocused X  X  approach when seeking three-dimensional (3D) arrangements. Kules and Shneiderman (2008) quantitatively analyzed searcher com-to use/difficult to use, stimulating/dull, satisfying/frustrating, manageable/overwhelming, simple/complex, fast enough/too ficult (Dift), confused (Cfus), and exhaustive (Ehtv), whereas those for Ease of Use (EU) are manageable (Mngb), satisfying (Stfy), stimulating (Stml), simple (Smpl), and focused (Focs).

Table 1 lists the observed variables and measured question statements for each latent variable. 2.5. Hypotheses 2.5.1. Information need Researchers have presented different models of children X  X  information needs in a general form ( Shenton &amp; Dixon, 2005;
Walter, 1994 ). Based on an information-need study of the online behaviors of 641 Taiwanese primary school students in (30.8%), and escape daily pressures (20%). However, Bet X l Yilmaz and Orhan (2010) examined the motivations for Internet educational aims. Scarpi (2012) noted that information-searching customers may act on momentary urges, be driven by fun and curiosity, or be goal-oriented, task-focused utilitarians. Thus, whereas this is an explanatory framework for children exhibiting different information-seeking behaviors (for example, learning and playing), children experiencing the emotional aspect of information need, such as for entertainment and problem solving, must be addressed to improve the information-seeking model of children. Thus we propose the following hypothesis: H1. The Entertainment information need serves as a stronger preference motivator for children to start using/searching in
VW retrieval interface of DL than does the Problem-Solving information need. 2.5.2. VW retrieval interface Many researchers have studied the skills required when children seek information on the Internet ( Dresang, 1999; compose queries, and/or select small objects.

The fact that children aged 6 X 7 years old like to read picture books, whereas children aged 11 X 12 years old like to read children typically improve gradually up to adolescence, children of varying ages adopt different strategies for information retrieval.

Paivio (2006) discussed dual-coding theory, which relates that visual and verbal information are processed differently and along distinct channels in the human mind. As the concepts from human perception theory were introduced in informa-tion retrieval works related to the visualization system user research ( Koshman, 2006; Morse, Lewis, &amp; Olsen, 2002; Yu, lack literacy skills; therefore, they prefer to conduct visual-based searches. Based on this evidence/literature, our H
H2. Children use a VW retrieval interface with icons more intuitively than a VW retrieval interface with text and sound symbols.

Previous research revealed differences in IS behavior between users of text-sound interfaces and those using graphical icons. Morse et al. (2002) tested visual information retrieval methodologies by comparing textual, icon, graphical, and  X  X  X pring X  X  displays and found that user performance with the textual interface was superior to the other interfaces (p. 35); however, the graphical methods (icon, graphs,  X  X  X pring X  X ) were preferred by adult when the complexity of the task increased.
While children have limited literacy skills, we can assume that children prefer visual interface to avoid difficulties in unknown text and searching related information. Thus, H 3
H3. Children who use a VW retrieval interface with text-sound face more difficulty than those who use a VW retrieval interface with graphic icon. 2.5.3. Affective state
Martens (2012) addressed the development of interfaces for digital resources for children, ranging from icons to metadata and hierarchical approaches. The contexts of individual children, such as wildly differing affective states, and meaningful metadata for one child may be incomprehensible to another. Bilal (2001), Bilal (2002b) suggested that emotions can pro-foundly influence the overall effectiveness with which children use a Web search engine on research tasks (learning) and on fully self-generated search tasks (playing). Researchers have characterized student mental models of Web searches ( Zhang, 2008 ) and developed affective systems able to recognize and appropriately respond to human emotions ( Lopatovska &amp; Arapakis, 2011 ), which ultimately improve the interface and make HCI experiences increasingly effective and pleasurable.

Barendregt, Bekker, Bouwhuis, and Baauw (2006) conducted an experiment in which children encountered different types of problems during their first use and after they have practiced with a game. Usability problems caused by a lack of knowledge (anxiousness and uncertainty) were more often identified during first use (not ease of use). Fun problems related to a too-high challenge level (anxiousness and uncertainty) may disappear after some practice (ease of use). Thus, the anx-on these studies, we presented the relationships among anxiousness, uncertainty and ease of use through the formulation of the following hypothesis: H4. Anxiousness and Uncertainty are negatively correlated with the Ease of Use as it relates to child affective states.
While investigating the subjective variables involved in an information search process, Gwizdka and Lopatovska (2009) determined that a good mood before and during a search correlates with a subsequent good mood but also with poor search outcomes and reduced satisfaction. Thus, feeling some  X  X ain X  during a search helps ensure  X  X ain X  in the form of quality outcomes. We suggest that children seek information to solve their problem (studying) and wish to reduce the uncertainty that impedes their search for information. While seeking information for the sake of entertainment enhances ones X  ability to endure uncertainty. Thus we propose the following hypothesis:
H5. Children engaged in problem-solving searches experience less uncertainty and anxiety than those engaged in searches purely as a diversion.

Blom and Monk (2003) suggested that users personalize their computers for emotional reasons, including sense of con-trol, ownership, fun, and simple boredom. Yannakakisa and Hallam (2008) explored the Playware game and a control task and indicated two different classes of children: those that prefer constant energetic play with low mental/emotional load and those that report deriving fun from dynamic play that involves high mental/emotional load independent of physical ished control. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis:
H6. Children value ease of use more highly when engaged in a search purely as a diversion, compared to when they are seeking to solve a problem.
 Fig. 2 presents the latent variables of the child-oriented IS model: Information Need, Interface Media, and Affective State.
When examined using SEM, these latent variables can help in the development of an improved interface for information retrieval. 2.6. Research questions
Affective technology, affective computing, and emotional design are growing fields in computer science, human X  X om-puter interaction, and cognitive science. This study focused on building a model to explore children X  X  cognition of uncer-tainty and sense of control while searching for information using a VW retrieval interface. Thus, a well-designed VW retrieval interface may act as a toy or a tool. 1. Which kind of VW retrieval interface is preferred by children with specific information needs (playing or learning)? 2. What are the affective states experienced by children using a VW retrieval interface? 3. What are the affective states experienced by children with specific information needs (playing or learning)? 3. Methodology 3.1. Participants
A group of 227 many children aged 7 X 10 were selected for this study. The sample selection was in accordance with the methods outlined by Piaget (1995) , who explained that children demonstrate behavior and reactions corresponding to their stage of growth stages. Children in the concrete operation stage (7 X 11-year olds) may understand hierarchies and reverse actions which enable them to use a greater variety of technologies and software than children in the pre-operational stage.
Cooper (2002) found that young children prefer visual information to textual information. Children in the range of 7 X  11 years quickly improve their visual capabilities and employ various search strategies. Nonetheless, their IS behaviors in a VW interface have not previously been investigated.

These 227 primary school students (7 X 11-year olds) in 9 classes, 117 boys and 110 girls, who were under teacher super-faces were set in three types, one type with text-sound (non-graphic) icons, one type with graphic (non-text-sound) icons, and one type with text-sound-graphic icons. Table 2 lists the grade and group of the participating children. 3.2. Measures
The National Library of Public Information (NLPI) also established a Chinese digital library for children in Taiwan. The viding a virtual world that contains different icons associated with different databases.

The VW retrieval interface is designed according to the way-finding concept and map-structure hierarchy. When children search information in the main frame designed, they move the courser (the little red spaceman) right or left in the map to choose the icon which represents a different category and then click to enter next frame. Child may surf through different icons that represent sub-frames and linked databases. When they reach the final target, a small frame of the chosen database will expand pout to describe the database content in detail.

Thatcher (2008) found that different types of tasks (research-defined and real-life searching) influence users in their by Ingwersen: verificative information need (well-defined and stable), conscious topical information need (well-defined and more variable nature), and muddled topical information need (poorly defined and high cognitive uncertainty). The IS behav-behavior, according to the nature of the tasks they are performing and the information they seek. Bilal (2000) also stated that children performed better in fact-based searches than in research assignments. Crow (2011) claimed that children employ search strategies according to the nature of the information they require.

Children in the pre-operational stage (2 X 7 year olds) tend to concentrate on only one characteristic of an object at a time, while 7 X 11 year olds expand their IS behavior to encompass many of the aspects of their everyday lives. Thus, we set two IS tasks: (1) find the Taiwan Historical Dictionary and (2) find the Green Sour Bear Picture Books database.
Fact-based assignments, such as searching for the meaning of a word in a dictionary, provide a focus for the child. Broader study had the students perform each type of task in order to elicit different searching strategies and affective states when using the VW retrieval interfaces.
 The questionnaire draft was developed according to the theoretical constructs. Two university experts in Childhood
Education and Human X  X omputer Interaction reviewed the interface, tasks, and the questionnaire draft. We also ran a pilot
The search exercises and questionnaires were administered in the reading room of a school library, which allowed the children to fill out the questionnaires by themselves. Before children began searching, the required tasks were printed on paper for children to read, and a research assistant explained the process to the children individually. Each student had 90 s for each task, with 10 s in between to reset the work station.

Following the examination, each student was given ten minutes to complete the questionnaire (as shown on Table 1 ), and an assistant was available to answer any questions. The questionnaire results were analyzed using SEM to reveal the experi-ences the children had when using the interface. 4. Results 4.1. Equations for path analysis To assess the relationships among variables, such as uncertainty and fun, statistical analysis was applied. MacFarlane,
Sim, and Horton (2005) suggested using experimental methods to measure the fun and usability of educational software for children. Markopoulos and Bekker (2003) discussed methods for evaluating interactive products for children. Lane,
Anderson, Ponce, and Natesan (2012) applied confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to measure library service quality over time. Moreover, Derbaix and Pecheux (1999) applied CFA to measure the mood construct for children aged 8 X 12 years old. Thus, this study applies LISREL 8.72  X  Structural Equation Modeling, which combines factor analysis and statistical analysis method combines several factors into a single meaningful factor by determining the commonality in several datasets, and path analysis elucidates the relationships among several factors. Most abstract cognition factors considered here are hypothetical constructs and so are difficult to measure directly. Applying SEM involves using questionnaire data to measure the effect of an observed variable, such as the experiences of children in using an interface. A latent variable can be evaluated by combining the effects of multiple observed variables. Moreover, the relationship between two latent variables is determined by combining the effects of their corresponding observed variables. Several latent variables and the paths that link them form an SEM model. The weightings of routes indicate the strength of the causal relationships ( Mulaik &amp; James, 1995 ).

Fig. 4 shows that d and e are statistical measurement errors for observed variables. k the relationships among latent variables. The following structural equations are applied: This equation indicates that EN and PS influence TS.
 This equation indicates that EN and PS influence GI.
 This equation indicates that TS and GI influence AU.

This equation indicates that TS, GI, and AU influence EU. 4.2. Test of dimensionality
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted using the principal components model with the oblique rotation tech-nique (Direct Oblimin). All indices were adequate according to standards of sampling adequacy (KMO MSA 0.900, Bartlett X  X  test of sphericity 2376.4, p &lt; 0.001). The resulting 6 factors explained 64.91% of the variance in the data.
Unidimensionality of the measures was confirmed by the fact that most of the items contributed to the loading of their validity and discriminant validity. 4.3. Measurement model 4.3.1. Factor loading
Individual observed variables were assessed by examining the loadings on the latent constructs. The standardized factor tics show that the convergent validity and the identification of measurement model are accepted ( Kellowway, 1998, p. 107 ).
The results are listed in Table 3 . 4.3.2. Squared multiple correlation
The squared multiple correlation (SMC) indicates the amount of variance in the scale items explained by the common factors. Higher squared multiple correlations reflect measurement variables of greater reliability, compared to the corresponding latent constructs. The SMCs for the scale items are summarized in Table 3 . Overall the adequacy of the mea-surement model was supported. For example, variable Aten explains 63% of the variation in the latent construct  X  Entertainment Information Need (EN). Ehtv explains 59% of the variation in the latent construct  X  Anxiousness and
Uncertainty affective state (AU). 4.4. Structural model
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to estimate the structural model (LISREL 8.72). Apart from the chi-square 0.98; SRMR: 0.050, RMSEA: 0.054). We estimated the path coefficients ( b ) and R -squared value of the structural model. Table 4 shows the overall results.

Overall, the research model had acceptable predictive power for endogenous constructs exceeding the required value of 0.67 are above-average, those around 0.33 are average, and those of 0.19 and lower are weak. Thus, the amount of explained are confirmed and their respective t -values are statistically significant at the 0.05 level. 4.5. Path analysis Path weights can be analyzed to determine the influences among latent variables ( Fig. 5 and Table 4 ).
Comparing the path-weights between Information Need and Interface Media reveals that the IS behavior values of chil-dren with Entertainment Information Need ( c 11 = .70  X  X  X  X  , c Thus, H 1 is accepted.

Comparing the path-weights between Interface Media and Affective State reveals that the retrieval interface with text-( b 32 = .16 n.s. , b 42 = .44  X  ). While the VW retrieval interface with text-sound positively influences ( b

The latent variable Anxiety and Uncertainty negatively influences ( b tors related to uncertainty negatively correlated with those related to ease of use and usability, and this indicating the increase in uncertainty leads to diminished sense of ease of use. Thus, H
The total weight of the paths between the latent variable Entertainment Information Need to Anxiety and Uncertainty is accepted.

The total weight of the paths between the latent variable Entertainment Information Need and Ease of Use (.73  X  X  X  X  ) exceeds that between Problem-Solving Information Need and Ease of Use (.34  X  X  X  X  ). Thus, H 5. Discussion 5.1. Relationship between information need and interface media
H 1 is accepted. This result strengthens the findings of Lu (2010) that children prefer to seek information as a diver-sion (40.8%) and solve problems (30.8%), although children mainly treated the VW retrieval interface as a toy and sought fun. When seeking information via different VW retrieval interfaces, children slightly preferred the VW retrieval interface with text-sound to the VW retrieval interface with graphic icon. However, the VW retrieval interface with graphic icon still benefits children who do not recognize many characters when they are seeking information. 5.2. Relationship between interface media and affective state
H 2 is rejected. Thus, the text-sound retrieval interface lead to high risk of both pain-anxiety under uncertainty and text-sound with hesitation, as partially explained by Sadler-Smith (2011) .

H 3 is rejected. The children considered the VW retrieval interface with text-sound easier to manipulate. Because all Grade 1 students in Taiwanese primary schools learn the phonetic Chinese alphabet, which helps them to correctly pronounce
Chinese characters they do not recognize, these children can use a phonetic alphabet to guess the meaning of a subject-icon in the retrieval interface with text-sound in a simple task to achieve a good performance. Given that the text interface is accurate, and it is easy to determine the meaning of a textual icon, children thought the text interface was easier to use. 5.3. Relationship between latent variables in affective state
H 4 is accepted. Children X  X  uncertainty feelings would influence their ease of using a digital library system in a negative way. The uncertainty of the children undermined their self-confidence and thus their experience with regard to ease of use. 5.4. Relationship between information need and affective state
H 5 is accepted. When the children sought information to solve their problem (studying), they wished to reduce uncer-tainty, which impeded their search for information. When seeking information as a diversion (playing), they could endure slightly more uncertainty.

H 6 is accepted. When seeking information to change their mood, the children hope for significant control over their affec-tive state. In addition, when seeking information to solve a problem, the children can experience a sense of diminished control.

Thus, children with different Information Needs underlying their information-seeking behaviors have different tolerances for the un-controlled state that they can endure. Sim et al. (2006) explained that learning was not correlated with fun or usability, but fun and usability were correlated with each other. However, when seeking entertainment information (i.e., fun), the participating children emphasized Ease of Use (i.e., usability), but when seeking problem-solving information (i.e., learning), the children did not emphasize Ease of Use (usability) quite as heavily.

Furthermore, Tenopir et al. (2008) indicated that positive feelings are frequently mixed with thoughts regarding results task at hand, limited collections of the digital database, and uncertainty regarding searching the system. While Verhagen the current path analysis clearly quantitatively identified the mixed thinking of children about how the information needs related to fun and effective navigation are related and how the information needs related to learning and the feasibility of reducing uncertainty in an IR system search are related. 5.5. Theoretical findings (2013) claimed that, among college students, uncertainty in a game-like learning tool can stimulate learning. Chowdhury et al. (2011) described how uncertainty in IS behavior in an academic environment can have a positive impact whereas and a sense of fun in children, which motivates them to explore and learn. This study examined the relationships among fun, learning, uncertainty, and interface usability to provide a reference for the development of software capable of stimulating learning. We examined the causality between learning and enjoyment in order to better understand the IS behavior of chil-dren having fun as well as the media channels and VW search interfaces that they prefer, and whether the feelings of uncer-tainty and sense of control generated by these activities vary according to their learning and searching behavior. 5.5.1. Influence of information needs on VW interface preferences
In the eyes of children, search interfaces can be toys as well as tools. The principles of information visualization can be from conventional text-based interfaces. Our results show that when children have information needs induced by emotions (rather than information needs for solving problems), children prefer using this kind of virtual search interface.
Clearly, children select an interface that satisfies their information needs. Designing an interface that is both easy and enjoyable to use reduces cognitive load and makes the entire process more enjoyable. If children have different information thetics ( S X nchez-Franco, Peral-Peral, &amp; Villarejo-Ramos, 2014 ). 5.5.2. Uncertainty caused by graphic-and-text media Digital libraries accommodate a variety of media and use different types of media channels and interfaces for searching. grate information visualization principles with icons and mental maps to incorporate human perceptions of space, assist in information searches, and merge multiple information channels. These measures can increase the effectiveness of searches; however, they also promote uncertainty.

This study focused on children in the concrete development stage. At this point in their development, their motor skills from those of adults. We sought to reveal the uncertainty and sense of control experienced by children searching for infor-mation using either text or graphic icons.

Bilal and Kirby (2002) observed that the IS behavior of children displays loops with an emphasis on concrete and intuitive manipulation. Although children are better able to understand abstract concepts in the concrete development stage than can links to help them in their search for information. Thus uncertainty and interface usability play an important role in their searching. This could be used to measure how helpful the information search interface is for the users.
According to dual-coding theory, the preferences of children with regard to graphical and textual interfaces may reflect their preferences in information accessibility and information diagnosticity.

A graphical interface is concrete. The influence of the VW interface with graphic icon on anxiety and uncertainty (GI ? AU = .16 n.s. ) was negative and did not reach significance. We speculate that although children can easily and intui-tively understand the meaning of graphic icons, they still feel a degree of uncertainty and confusion regarding the deeper connotations represented by the icons.

Textual media are form of an abstract meaning and not concrete and children in concrete stage make learning text more dren can accurately grasp the meaning of text, they will experience a high degree of information diagnosticity, which will make them feel that the interface is easy to use. According to dual-coding theory with multiple channels, each channel assumes a different function. When various channels (i.e. text, phonetic alphabet and voice) are used together to assist in searching, children demand a balance between accurate textual channels and accessible graphical channels to reduce their cognitive load. As for environmental context and surfer recognition, further research is required regarding the concept of space, the means of merging textual and graphical channels, the information and cognitive loads that they place on children, and the accessibility and diagnosticity of information provided by the media channels. 5.5.3. Tolerance of uncertainty in the use of interfaces during learning and playing This study investigated the influence of information need on the affective states of users via various information channels. changing. Users experience various forms of uncertainty according to the way that the new knowledge affects or alters their existing knowledge maps.

From the results of this study, we infer the following: When children play or when they do not have well-defined learning
Dreier, 2014, p. 495 X 496 ). Children often show orientations towards work procedures and attach less importance to ease of use. Instead, they want information to be useful and informative. In addition, the demand for accuracy gives them a lower tolerance for uncertainty.

Bet X l Yilmaz and Orhan (2010) investigated the motives of senior high school students in using the internet. They found information needs of adults while at play are numerous but superficial. The theory of message framing indicates that humans use greater effort to process information that they care about (central pathways-diagnostics) than they do for infor-tasks (during play), they focus more on information accessibility with regard to MIN, exhibit greater tolerance for uncer-tainty, demand greater usability, and require greater information accessibility.

While learning, children focus primarily on searching for facts and more fundamental CIN information associated with their studies. Under these circumstances, children focus more on problem solving, demand high information diagnosticity, and thus have lower tolerance for uncertainty and less demand for usability. 5.6. Limitations
This study investigated the correlation between fun and uncertainty among children seeking information via a virtual rea-1. The relationships among the latent variables set in the research model involve the influence of information needs on uncertainty via VW interfaces. Information needs exert an indirect effect on uncertainty, and thus, the affected uncer-tainty includes that influenced by information needs and that influenced by the VW interface. The proportions of these two types of uncertainty cannot be determined. We suggest that future researchers develop a model to measure the direct influence of information needs on uncertainty and compare the results with those of this study. 2. The influence of interactions between fun and uncertainty on IS behavior is an extremely complex issue. In this study, we incorporated fun as a latent variable of information needs and examined the resulting uncertainty and usability. However, we were unable to verify the reverse feedback influence of uncertainty stimulating learning motives (or information for verification and comparison. 3. This study showed that all of the participants enjoyed using the Chinese visualized interface; however larger samples are required in order to provide a valuable reference for the development of a game-format interface for the retrieval of infor-mation in which children have an interest. Regarding reading tasks used to stimulate self-generating information needs or MIN, this study employed experiments in which children were asked to perform artificial search tasks. Therefore the children did not seek information for personal needs/interests and the possible effects of this need to be taken into con-sideration. Further research task design for children preform self-generated searching in a VW retrieval interface is need.
Martens (2012, p. 167) suggested examining the context in which children operate, including their physical locations and information nodes in a VW retrieval interface thus merit further examination. 6. Conclusions
This study on IS was performed within a Taiwanese system using Taiwanese participants. The customized VW retrieval sion of a  X  X  X un X  X  interface could change the way children view the VW information-seeking, causing them to see it not merely tant topic could help in the development of a VW retrieval interface suitable for children to use when searching for information.
 Statistical confirmatory analysis was applied to clarify the relationships among the latent variables (Information Need,
Interface Media, and Affective State). (1) Children prefer using VW retrieval interfaces in the search for information as a form of entertainment, rather than (2) In this study, the text X  X ound interface proved easier to use but increased the sense of uncertainty when used by (3) Children searching for information as a form of entertainment were more willing to endure uncertainty and demanded
The children VW information-seeking model presents an alternative route that offers a new method of rechecking the information-seeking model and allows the researcher an opportunity to explore fun roles through which children can play with and learn from software. Furthermore, the relationships between the interface usability and bounded system and chil-dren affected modes in information studies may be explored by careful examination. This is the first study to identify the characteristics of an enjoyable, effective interface designed specifically to meet the needs of children searching for information.
