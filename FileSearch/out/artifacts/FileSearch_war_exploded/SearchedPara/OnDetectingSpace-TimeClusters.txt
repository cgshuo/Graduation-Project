 Detection of space-time clusters is an imp ortan t function in various domains (e.g., epidemiology and public health). The pioneering work on the spatial scan statistic is often used as the basis to detect and evaluate suc h clusters. State-of-the-art systems based on this approac h detect clusters with restrictiv e shap es that cannot mo del gro wth and shifts in location over time. We extend these metho ds signi X can tly by using the  X  X xible square pyramid shap e to mo del suc h ef-fects. A heuristic searc h metho d is dev elop ed to detect the most likely clusters using a randomized algorithm in com bi-nation with geometric shap es pro cessing. The use of Mon te Carlo metho ds in the original scan statistic form ulation is con tinued in our work to address the multiple hypothesis testing issues. Our metho d is applied to a real data set on brain cancer occurrences over a 19 year perio d. The cluster detected by our metho d sho ws both gro wth and movemen t whic h could not have been mo deled with the simpler cylin-drical shap es used earlier. Our general framew ork can be extended quite easily to handle other  X  X xible shap es for the space-time clusters.

Analyses of data to detect space-time clusters is relev ant to man y domains. Details on what constitutes a space-time cluster migh t vary from one domain to another. We will use the epidemiology domain to motiv ate the mo dels and algorithms presen ted in this pap er. For example, health o X cials often evaluate if an observ ed excess of disease cases in a space-time region is a cluster that warran ts a thorough investigation. Suc h an evaluation would include analyzing kno wn factors (e.g., population demographics) to determine if they can explain the excessiv e cases. The evaluation must also address the question whether the excessiv e cases could have occurred by chance. Detection of a space-time cluster of excessiv e cases that is not explained by kno wn factors and is very unlik ely to occur by chance would trigger a thorough investigation.

The scan statistic is a statistical metho d widely used to detect and evaluate suc h clusters [4]. A comprehensiv e re-view of metho ds to detect spatial clusters is given in [7, 4]. Tw o imp ortan t categories in spatial metho ds are detection of two dimensional spatial clusters and detection of three dimensional space-time clusters. We will consider the more general 3D space-time category in this pap er.
The spatial scan statistic dev elop ed by Martin Kulldor X  [6, 8] is widely referenced and used by epidemiologists. This powerful metho d for detecting a signi X can t region with el-evated disease rate has been dev elop ed using a Bernoulli mo del and also using a Poisson mo del for the underlying phenomenon [6]. For the Poisson mo del, events are allo wed to be generated by an inhomogeneous Poisson pro cess. For example, the exp ected num ber of disease events in a region would be prop ortional to its population assuming no other con tributing factors. We will use the Poisson mo del in this pap er to illustrate our work and to apply it to a data set from the epidemiology domain.

These mo dels have been implemen ted in a system for de-tecting space-time clusters (SaTScan) [9]. SaTScan detects space-time clusters using cylindrical windo ws with a circular geographic base and with the heigh t of the cylinder corre-sponding to some interv al in time. Geographical locations are speci X ed discretely (e.g., cen ters of coun ties) to SaTScan. Input data to SaTScan includes the num ber of cases and population information at these discrete locations at vari-ous times. SaTScan evaluates a set of cylindrical windo ws by considering all those spatially cen tered at any point in a user-sp eci X ed grid and exhaustiv ely varying the cylinder's radius and time duration. The evaluation computes the like-liho od ratio of the alternativ e hypothesis that there is an elev ated event rate within the cylindrical windo w and the null hypothesis that the rate is the same inside and outside the windo w. For the Poisson mo del, this likeliho od function [6] is prop ortional to where C is the total num ber of cases over the entire space and time, c is the num ber of cases within the windo w, and n is the exp ected num ber of cases within the windo w un-der the null hypothesis. The indicator function, I (), is 1 when the windo w has more cases than exp ected under the null hypothesis and is 0 otherwise. The cylindrical windo w with the largest value of the likeliho od function is the re-sulting cluster R . The multiple hypothesis testing problem is overcome in SaTScan by generating syn thetic datasets for the entire space-time region in whic h the event coun ts are indep enden tly generated conforming to the Poisson mo del for eac h location and time. Eac h of these syn thetic datasets is analyzed to determine its most dominan t cluster and its likeliho od function value. Using these Mon te Carlo exp eri-men ts one can determine the likeliho od that the cluster R could have occurred by chance under the null hypothesis (p-v alue).
A key strength of the spatial scan statistic is its pro v-able power in detecting a signi X can t time-space cluster with elev ated coun ts for the phenomena being mo deled [6]. How-ever, the use of cylindrical windo ws in curren t implemen ta-tions can limit the  X t to the phenomena being mo deled. Our work was motiv ated by the need to consider space-time clus-ters that can either gro w or shrink over time and that can also move over time. Intuitiv ely, we exp ect clusters with these characteristics to be very relev ant in the epidemiol-ogy domain and to also extend the applicabilit y of the scan statistic to other domains. The challenge is allo w this  X  X x-ibilit y in the scanned regions while keeping the computa-tion tractable. The magnitude of this challenge becomes more apparen t when we realize that even for simpler shap es the computation can be prohibitiv e if the grid is too  X ne, requiring clev er algorithms to prune the regions examined [11]. Our use of the Mon te Carlo based approac h to deal with the multiple hypothesis testing problem as adv ocated in [6, 7] adds signi X can tly to the computational challenge. Our choice of a  X  X xible shap e for the clusters and our ap-proac h to con taining the computational needs are outlined in Section 2. Section 3 details our new algorithm to de-tect these  X  X xible clusters. Results of applying our metho d to a dataset from the epidemiological domain are given in Section 4.

The clustering problem solv ed by the spatial scan statistic is quite di X eren t from the form ulation addressed by metho ds like CLIQUE [1]. A key di X erence pointed out in [11] is that hierarc hical metho ds require the measure de X ning the clus-ter to be monotonic so that bottom-up approac hes can be applied. However, the spatial scan statistic is not a mono-tonic measure. The reader is referred to [11] for a detailed discussion of this and other di X erences in the form ulations.
Our choice for the cluster shap e is a pyramid with square cross sections represen ting the included geographical area at eac h time in an interv al. Figure 2 illustrates this cluster shap e using 2D and 3D views. Our pyramid cluster can be truncated (need not include the apex) and is allo wed to ei-ther gro w or shrink from the start to the end of the time interv al. The 3D view in Figure 2 sho ws a cluster gro wing with time. The axis of the pyramid need not be orthogonal to the two spatial axes allo wing the cluster to mo del move-men t of the phenomena. This is clearly illustrated by the 2D view in Figure 2 where the squares represen t the geographi-cal exten t at discrete times in the cluster time interv al. The example in Figure 2 clearly illustrates the  X  X xibilit y of the cluster shap e to mo del various asp ects of real life phenom-ena.

Typically , input data includes occurrence coun ts and other information (e.g., disease coun ts and population) at discrete locations at various times. The entire data can be repre-sen ted using a set of points P in three dimensional space where eac h point corresp onds to a discrete location at a particular time. We use a subset S of these points P to represen t a candidate cluster, pro vided that S conforms to a square pyramid shap e. We will denote suc h a subset S as legal .
 De X nition D1 A subset S from a set of points P is legal ,
The total num ber of legal candidate subsets can be very large for most datasets. This rules out any exhaustiv e ap-proac h similar to the one used for cylindrical clusters. In-stead we use a heuristic searc h with randomized algorithms over the space of legal candidate clusters to  X nd the cluster with the largest likeliho od ratio (Equation 1). Our heuristic searc h cannot guaran tee that we will  X nd the cluster with the largest likeliho od ratio. The impact of using a heuris-tic approac h is discussed in Section 5. However, we will demonstrate using a real-life dataset that our approac h can generate useful results and shed greater insigh ts into the mo deled phenomena when compared to clusters restricted to simple shap es (e.g., cylinder). A similar approac h using sim ulated annealing has been rep orted recen tly for two di-mensional spatial clusters [2]. As exp ected, the extension to three dimensional space-time clusters raises signi X can t new challenges whic h are addressed in our work.
The heuristic searc h algorithm generates a large num ber of legal candidate clusters in a biased random fashion. The cluster with the largest likeliho od function amongst the gen-erated set of candidates is chosen as the resulting cluster so-lution. Our randomized searc h (Figure 1) is fashioned after earlier works on genetic algorithms [5] and approac hes like sim ulated annealing [12].

The searc h algorithm is called for eac h input data of oc-currences and exp ectations for the 3D points represen ting locations in time. This implies that the searc h algorithm will be called once for eac h exp erimen t in the Mon te Carlo based hypothesis testing. The iterativ e searc h algorithm uses and adds to a population of candidate solutions. The maxim um size of this population is one of the parameters that can be set by the user. Intuitiv ely, a larger population allo ws a wider exploration of the solution space reducing the likeliho od of getting stuc k in a locally optimal solution prematurely . Typical values used in our exp erimen ts are rep orted in Section 4. Step 1 in the searc h algorithm in Fig-ure 1 is to initialize the population of candidate solutions. In our exp erimen ts, we initialized the population to the clusters con taining single points with non-zero occurrences. Metho d Searc h (Input: Occurrences and exp ectations for 1.

Generate multiple candidate solutions 7. Evaluate newly generated candidate solutions 8. Add to candidate solution population based 9. Output most signi X can t cluster based on likeliho od ratio end Searc h Figure 1: High level description of searc h algorithm
The num ber of iterations of steps 2 to 8 is speci X ed by the user. In eac h iteration, new candidate solutions (children) are generated based on existing solutions in the population (paren ts). Our exp erimen ts suggest that both transforma-tions causing large and small changes to paren ts are useful in the searc h pro cess. As rep orted extensiv ely in the sim ulated annealing literature, large changes are more e X ectiv e earlier in the iterativ e pro cess and smaller changes more useful later [12].

Steps 3 and 4 in Figure 1, generate children using large changes to the paren ts. Tw o paren ts, A 1 and A 2, are se-lected biased towards solutions with higher likeliho od ratios. Both paren ts are cut by a 3D hyperplane chosen at random to generate at most four pieces. The pieces are com bined to generate children analogous to the crosso ver operation in genetic algorithms [5]. The pieces themselv es are also considered as children of this transformation. Eac h child, represen ted as a set C of points, need not be legal at this point (De X nition D1). The next subsection describ es in de-tail how a legal candidate solution S is generated from a set C .

Steps 5 and 6 in Figure 1, mutate a single paren t B with small changes at its boundary . Mutations that increase the size of B and that decrease its size are applied. One of the six faces of the pyramid corresp onding to B is chosen us-ing heuristics for applying eac h kind of mutation. Points close to the chosen face are selected for addition or remo val biased towards larger or smaller likeliho od ratios, resp ec-tively. Intuitiv ely, if there is a point outside B but close to its boundary with relativ ely high occurrence coun t it will likely be added to B to form a new candidate solution. Sim-ilarly , a point in B close to its boundary with relativ ely low occurrence coun t will likely be remo ved to form a new can-didate solution.

Step 7 evaluates all the legal candidate solutions by com-puting their likeliho od ratios. They are added to the can-didate population and the weak est solutions dropp ed if the population size limit has been reac hed (Step 8). The legal candidate solution with the best likeliho od ratio after all it-erations are completed is output as the result of the searc h.
Generating a legal candidate solution S from a subset of points C is the most critical and interesting part of our searc h algorithm. We consider the given subset of points C as the target for the points con tained in a legal candidate S solution deriv ed from it. There are man y intuitiv e for-mulations for the generation of S and we list three of them below. 1. Generate the minim um volume legal solution S that 2. Generate the maxim um volume legal solution S that 3. Generate the legal solution S that is closest to the set Our system framew ork allo ws us to explore all suc h form u-lations and we have exp erimen ted with the  X rst two form u-lations in the list above. Since the  X rst two form ulations are quite similar, we will describ e only the  X rst one in more detail in this pap er.

In the  X rst form ulation, given a set of points C we need to generate a legal solution S corresp onding to a square pyra-mid Q that minimizes the volume over all square pyramids that include all the points in C . Minim um and maxim um times for Q, t min and t max , are determined simply by com-puting them over the set of points C . Consider the cross-section of the pyramid at t min . The anc hor (point with smallest x and y values) for the cross section at t min has co-ordinates ( a; b ). The side of the square cross-section at t has dimension g . At t max , the corresp onding parameters are ( c; d ) and h .

The coordinates of the cross-section anc hor ( u; v ) at any point t in the time interv al [ t min ; t max ] can be calculated as sho wn in Equation 2 below. A similar linear relation can be used to determine the side w of the cross-section (Equation 3).
The cross-sectional parameters of Q computed in Equa-tions 2 and 3 can be used to deriv e linear constrain ts that have to be satis X ed. For eac h point z in C that has to be con tained in Q, we can deriv e four linear constrain ts that specify that z is within the square cross-section of Q at the time t corresp onding to z .

The objectiv e function for this form ulation is the mini-mization of the volume of Q as speci X ed in Equation 4 be-low.
The minim um volume square pyramid Q can be deter-mined by solving the con vex quadratic programming prob-lem of minimizing volume ( Q ) sub ject to the four linear con-strain ts for eac h point in C as discussed above [13]. Once the parameters of the minim um volume Q have been deter-mined, we can easily determine the corresp onding solution S expressed as a set of points by determining all points con-tained in Q .

This intuitiv e form ulation requires signi X can t computa-tional resources since the quadratic programming solv er has to be invoked for every poten tially interesting candidate gen-erated in the random searc h algorithm. In a randomized searc h setting one can argue that insisting on the minim um volume solution is overkill for candidates ( C ) generated by the heuristics describ ed earlier. To ease the computational requiremen t we have also implemen ted an appro ximate ver-sion that evaluates a restricted set of square pyramids and picks the one with the smallest volume amongst them. In this appro ximate approac h, we consider three candidates for eac h of the four vertical faces of the pyramid. These candi-dates are com bined to generate a set of legal square pyra-mids con taining all the points in C and the minim um volume pyramid amongst them is chosen. This appro ximate form u-lation need not  X nd the solution with the absolute minim um volume since it does not explore all square pyramids con-taining the points in C . However, exp erimen tal results so far with the appro ximate form ulation are encouraging since the generated solutions are comparable to those pro duced by the exact form ulation but at a fraction of the computational cost.

The shap es pro cessing describ ed above can be easily ex-tended to pyramids with other regular polygons for their cross sections. Regular polygons with man y sides could also be used to appro ximate cone shap ed cluster regions.
The algorithm in Figure 1 is applied to the data corre-sponding to the actual occurrences and to the data syn the-sized for eac h of the Mon te Carlo exp erimen ts represen ting the null-h ypothesis that the occurrences follo w the Poisson pro cess based on the population distributions. The results pro duced by our system include the likeliho od ratio of the strongest cluster in the actual occurrence data and its char-acteristics. The p-v alue is computed from the rank of this cluster (based on the likeliho od ratios) amongst all the ex-perimen ts (actual and Mon te Carlo). The p-v alue is used to determine if the cluster is signi X can t or could have occurred by chance. Signi X can t clusters would merit more detailed investigations by domain exp erts.
We will demonstrate the use of our approac h by doing ret-rosp ectiv e analysis on a brain cancer data set that has been analyzed earlier [8, 10]. We will use the condensed version of this data that is used as a sample dataset in SaTScan [9] for retrosp ectiv e analysis using the Poisson mo del. The data has coun ts for occurrences of brain cancer in 32 coun ties eac h year from 1973 to 1991. The data set also includes covari-ates like age and gender whic h can be factored out by various metho ds [8, 9] in a comprehensiv e epidemiological investiga-tion. We will use the metho d of indirect standardization for this task follo wing the approac h used in the SaTScan sys-tem [3, 9, 8]. The condensed brain cancer dataset includes values for two covariates, age (discretized) and gender. We will give the results for the cylindrical and square pyramid clusters after factoring out these two covariates.
The population information is pro vided with gaps of about 10 years requiring that we interp olate to get the values for the remaining years [9]. There are a total of 1175 occur-rences of brain cancer in this data set. Since the occurrences are given ann ually for eac h of the 32 coun ties, there are a total of 19  X  32 = 608 space-time points to be considered in our analysis.

First, we will presen t results for the cylindrical clusters using the SaTSan system [9]. The default application of SaTScan (using only the 32 coun ty locations as cen troids) would only searc h a limited set of cylindrical candidates and would be inadequate for comparison with our square pyra-mid clusters. A better comparison can be done by forc-ing consideration of a larger set of cylindrical candidates in SaTScan by pro viding a  X ne grid for the cen troids. The SaTScan results in Table 1 are obtained by using a grid of size 1 Cartesian unit and a limit of 100 Cartesian units for the radius and allo wing the temp oral cluster exten t to reac h up to 90% of the total perio d. The most likely cluster (with maxim um log likeliho od ratio) extends for 5 years from 1985 to 1989 and includes 12 coun ties (cen troid and radius are given in the table). The ratio of num ber of actual cases to the exp ected gives the relativ e risk value of 1 : 356. The p-v alue was computed using 999 Mon te Carlo replications. Log likeliho od ratio 13.69 Num ber of cases 265 (195.36 exp ected)
Overall relativ e risk 1.356 p-v alue 0.003 Cen troid coordinates (90, 82) Cross-section radius 50.21 Time frame 1985-1989 Table 1: Cylindrical cluster results using  X ne grid
Our algorithm (Figure 1) for detecting more  X  X xible clus-ters was applied to this data using the appro ximate shap es pro cessing for square pyramids describ ed in Section 3.2. In our algorithm, the choices for the maxim um num ber of it-erations and the upp er limit on the population of candidate solutions are made considering the follo wing tradeo X . In-creasing the population of candidate solutions expands the searc h space impro ving the chances of  X nding the global op-tim um but also slows the con vergence to any local optim um by requiring more iterations. The maxim um num ber of iter-ations in searc h algorithm was set at 100K and the maxim um size of the population of candidate solutions was set at 10K. Log likeliho od ratio 17.105 Num ber of cases 292 (211.57 exp ected)
Overall relativ e risk 1.38 p-v alue 0.017 Time frame 1982-1989
The characteristics of square pyramid cluster detected by our system are given in Table 2. The p-v alue of 0 : 017 es-timated using 999 Mon te Carlo replications is higher than the 0 : 003 value in Table 1, but the cluster is signi X can t us-ing the threshold of 0 : 05. The cluster is visualized using 3D and 2D views in Figure 2 and clearly sho ws the gro wth and movemen t over time. The squares (both with solid and with dashed lines) represen t the cross-sections of the pyra-mid cluster increasing in size from 1982 to 1989. This cluster Figure 2: Detected cluster with a square pyramid shap e (2D and 3D views) includes only 4 coun ties at the start but expands to include 16 coun ties at the end.

The points mark ed by  X  in the 2D view represen t the loca-tions of the 32 coun ties in the data. We have also plotted the circular cross-section of SaTScan's cylindrical cluster (from Table 1) in the 2D view of Figure 2. The squares with the solid lines corresp ond to the years for whic h the cylindrical cluster was activ e (i.e., 1985-1989). The squares with the dashed lines represen t the portion of the square pyramid cluster for the years (1982-1984) preceding the cylindrical cluster. The value of the  X  X xibilit y in the cluster shap e be-comes clear when we compare the clusters with cylindrical and the pyramid shap es in Figure 2.

The power of using a more  X  X xible cluster shap e comes with increased computational costs. Our protot ype imple-men tation took 34 hours to perform the 1000 exp erimen ts needed to rep ort the results in Table 2 on an IBM Intellis-tation M-Pro computer with an Intel P4 pro cessor running at 2.2 Ghz. In comparison, the SaTScan run to detect the cylindrical cluster (using the  X ne grid) took only 2.5 hours on the same mac hine.

Good heuristics are clearly imp ortan t for randomized searc h algorithms to have any chance of e X cien tly  X nding solutions close to optimal in the huge space of candidate solutions. Our curren t protot ype system is practically useful for ret-rosp ectiv e analysis pro vided the total num ber of space-time points is kept within limits by grouping along the space or time axes. The indep enden t Mon te Carlo exp erimen ts allo w parallelization leading to easily achiev able reductions in the elapsed times for this analysis.
The imp ortance of having good con vergence beha vior for the randomized algorithm can be illustrated by comparing the two solutions displa yed in Figure 3. The solution pre-sen ted earlier in Table 2 with a likeliho od ratio of 17 : 105 is displa yed with solid lines in Figure 3. Another solution that is a local optim um with a sligh tly smaller likeliho od ratio of 17 : 061 is displa yed with dashed lines in the same  X gure. Clearly , the characteristics of these two clusters are di X eren t enough to con vey di X eren t insigh ts about the phenomenon to the user. Expanding the solution space by allo wing clus-ters with more  X  X xible shap es also creates man y locally op-timal solutions with high likeliho od ratios. Allo wing more  X  X xible cluster shap es also impacts the chance of  X nding strong clusters in the random data used for the Mon te Carlo exp erimen ts. These factors along with the kno wn character-istics of the phenomenon being mo deled should determine the cluster shap e for the analysis. The two clusters in Fig-ure 3 with high likeliho od ratios also indicate the need to consider secondary clusters [9]. Figure 3: Comparing two solutions with log likeli-hood ratios of 17.105 and 17.061
Since the randomized searc h algorithm does not guaran-tee that it will con verge to the square pyramid cluster with the highest likeliho od ratio in eac h of the exp erimen ts, we need to consider the impact on the estimated p-v alue. We can visualize and partly assess this impact by performing multiple runs with di X eren t starting seeds for the random searc h algorithm. Eac h run will con verge to some solution for eac h Mon te Carlo exp erimen t (with syn thesized data).
For our randomized searc h algorithm, Figure 4 plots the best (  X  ) and worst (  X  ) log likeliho od ratios for eac h Mon te Carlo exp erimen t over 5 runs (with di X eren t random seeds). The exp erimen ts are in sorted order along the x-axis by their mean likeliho od ratio (over the 5 runs). The solid line at 17.1 corresp onds to the cluster in the actual data and the Figure 4: Con vergence range for the Mon te Carlo exp erimen ts dashed lines at 18.22 and 15.82 corresp ond to the p-v alue thresholds of 0.01 and 0.05, resp ectiv ely. This plot gives some indication that the true p-v alue is unlik ely to be below the 0.05 threshold.

This visualization does not address any systematic weak-ness in the randomized searc h algorithm that may prev ent it from  X nding solutions close to the optimal. It is useful only to displa y the spread due to the randomization in the searc h. Our conjecture to explain the con vergence beha v-ior is that our algorithm is more e X ectiv e when there is a dominan t cluster but requires more iterations when there are man y comparable clusters at di X eren t parts of the solu-tion space (as can happ en in the Mon te Carlo exp erimen ts). While impro vemen ts in the searc h algorithm could mak e it more robust, one cannot guaran tee  X nding the optimal solu-tion for eac h exp erimen t with heuristic searc h. Further work is needed to formally characterize the p-v alue estimated by suc h metho ds.
We have presen ted a novel approac h to detecting space-time clusters that can mo del gro wth (or shrink age) and movemen t of the phenomenon over time. This was accom-plished by extending the form ulation of the space-time scan statistic to clusters with a square pyramid shap e. A heuris-tic searc h algorithm was dev elop ed to detect clusters with this more  X  X xible shap e since exhaustiv e metho ds are not practical. The randomized searc h algorithm was com bined with geometrical shap es pro cessing functions to determine the most likely square pyramid clusters. Our approac h was applied to a real brain cancer data set that included co-variates represen ting other confounding factors. We detect stronger clusters with very di X eren t characteristics using our approac h compared to earlier results for simpler cylindrical clusters. The square pyramid cluster detected by our ap-proac h exhibits both gro wth and movemen t in the disease, something that could not be mo deled with the cylindrical geometry . Our framew ork can be extended quite easily to handle clusters with other  X  X xible shap es by adding the ap-propriate geometric mo dules.
