The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review try. Then, in Section 6, we present our conclusions. -Association rule mining -Patent analysis Several software tools and services have been developed in the patent field [1, 5]. knowledge, and report changes to business managers by ranking the degree of change. -Patent Indicators 11]. The common patent indicators are described below [2, 4, 8, 11]: Patent age: the age of a patent. classes. classes. 
Technology Cycle Time (TCT): it is the median age of the patents cited by the tar-get patent. It is a measure of technological progress. As shown in Fig. 1, the proposed patent trend change mining (PTCM) technique comprises four components: a patent fetcher, a patent transformer, a patent indicator calculator, and a change detec-tion module. 
Patent fetcher: The patent fetcher module uses a keyword search strategy to retrieve patents for analysis. Patent fetcher acquires patent documents from the patent website and stores them into the patent document pool. 
Patent transformer: This module transforms the raw patent document from HTML format into a text format, stores it in the database, filters out ir-relevant content, and extracts required patent content, including the patent database for further processing to compute patent indicators. documents. 4.1 Patent Trend Mining level trends.

We apply association rule mining to patent data to identify patent trends (frequent tracted from patent documents. 4.2 Patent Trend Comparison rule format) are compared to identify changes. trends, the types of change should be clarified. Types of change: 
Based on previous research [7, 9], we define four types of change in patent trends. Rule matching: periods [7, 9]. Identifying the type of change: measurements are adopted from [7, 9]. The four types of event change can be classi-process of identifying the types of changes follows a pre-determined sequence. 4.3 Evaluating th e Degree of Change As a large number of changes occur in a competitive business environment, managers the degree of change, and rank the changed rules according to their importance. appropriate strategies. We used a keyword-based approach to select a subset of the Taiwan semiconductor-contains 2,352 patent documents for the period 2001 to 2002, while the second part 2004. -Changes in the R&amp;D activities of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd: From patent trend (1) in Table 2, we observe the rapid growth (57%) of the company period under study, TSMC exhibited a high degree of inventiveness in the technologi-cal field H01L29/788. -R&amp;D activities of Taiwan X  X  semiconductor industry: vested in H01L29/76 consistently throughout the period under study. The high growth basic patents in these technological fields. -Technological competitiveness of companies in Taiwan X  X  semiconductor industry: 2004. -Technological competitiveness of companies in specific technological fields: medium CI in H01L21/336 declined, which may imply a change in UMC X  X  innovative activities. The comparison requires human effort and time. Moreover, the degrees of change can have proposed a patent trend change mining (PTCM) technique that captures changes business managers by ranking the degrees of change. We applied the proposed PTCM to Taiwan X  X  semiconductor industry for the period 2001-2004 to discover changes in appropriate strategies according to their findings.
