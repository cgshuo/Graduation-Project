The emergence of what is called the social web and the continuing stream of new applications and community-based platforms including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and others had a substantial impact on recommender systems research and practice over the last years in different ways.
First, today X  X  web users are more willing to share more about themselves than before the Web 2.0, thus providing more information sources that can be leveraged in the user modeling and recommendation process. Furthermore, the newly available information sources can not only be used to optimize the recommendations for an individual user, but can also help to identify more general patterns and trends in the behavior of the community that can be exploited by other applications.

Second, personalization, information filtering and recom-mendation are often the central functionality of many of these social web based applications. On typical social net-works, users for example get recommendations for news to read, songs to listen to, groups to join, friends to follow, people to connect or jobs that might be interesting.
These developments lead to different challenges to be ad-dressed in recommender systems research. On the one hand, for example, the question arises of how to effectively com-bine the huge variety of information sources for improved recommendations. On the other hand, regarding the new op-portunities for applying recommender systems in social web environments, in many cases new techniques are required to address the particularities of the domain or to deal with scalability issues.

The ACM RecSys 2014 Workshop on Recommender Sys-tems and the Social Web aims to be a platform for re-searchers from academia and industry as well as for prac-titioners to present and discuss the various challenges and possible solutions related to all aspects of social web rec-ommendations. The call for papers correspondingly covered a variety of topics in this area including all sorts of appli-cations of recommender systems technology and their in-terfaces; collective knowledge creation and topic emergence; context-aware and group recommendation approaches; and case studies and empirical evaluations.

This year X  X  workshop was already the sixth in a series of successful workshops co-located with the ACM Confer-ence on Recommender Systems since 2009. Again, we re-ceived several submissions from researchers from academia and industry which were thoroughly reviewed and selected for presentation at the workshop by a program committee of international experts in the field.

The papers submitted to the workshop addressed a num-ber of different topics and put forward novel proposals to build social web recommender system. In the context of ap-plying recommendation technology to information personal-ization and resource ranking problems in Social Web envi-ronments, the submitted papers for example dealt with the problem of ranking community-provided product reviews based on opinion mining or with the recommendation of friends on social networks. As an example of how to lever-age Social Web information to build better systems, one of the works proposed to analyze the characteristics of pub-licly shared music playlists to better understand how future music recommendation systems should be designed. Finally, another contribution from industry addressed challenges and lessons learned when building large-scale collaborative filter-ing solutions on Social Web platforms in a real-world envi-ronment.
