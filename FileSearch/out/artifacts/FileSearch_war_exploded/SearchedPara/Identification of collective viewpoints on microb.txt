 1. Introduction
A microblog is a popular Web 2.0 system, such as Twitter 1 interesting and practical problem.
 gathered on microblogs for such event in October 2010.

How to represent them? Table 1 shows two sample tweets about viewpoints; furthermore, user viewpoints also may change as time goes by.
The closest research work is topic summarization, which has been studied extensively in the past [1 sentiment words such as adjectives or adverbs. But viewpoint discovery is not limited to such words. especially for random walk methods. In contrast to existing graph models, our proposed Term time granularity, our approach also avoids creating high-degree nodes. viewpoints is not trivial.

To summarize, our main contributions are as follows:  X  essence.  X  mining microblogs.  X  temporal aspects.  X

 2. Preliminaries and background 2.1. k-Partite graph adjacent. Such graph could aid us in modeling heterogeneous datasets. is, there is no edge between pairs of nodes in the same set. (3)  X  : E  X  R  X  .

The k-partite graph G can be used to model various kinds of objects, namely V of objects are denoted by edge set E . Some edges can be also associated with a set of attributes A = P =[ P ij ] | V | X | V | ,|  X  | denotes the element number of a set.

Hereafter, we refer to the random walk relevance as just  X  2.3. Microblogs background Short nature of tweets facilitates posting quickly, reaching audiences in seconds.

Pre-processing: representative term selection of unnecessary words are still retained and need to be further pruned. to detect the terms with a frequency burst. The entropy of term t in k days is defined as Entropy ( t )= whose entropy is smaller than a specified threshold will be selected. 5.2. Graph representation types of objects (i.e., nodes): terms, tweets and users, whose sets are denoted as V are also five types of relations between different node sets, which are denoted as directed edge set E respectively, E ={ E tw  X  E wt  X  E wu  X  E uw  X  E uu }. Each edge in E
E and E uw represents users' posting. And each edge in E uu directed edge going from node v i to node v j .

Additionally, each edge e ij  X  E is assigned a weight function, which is denoted as edge in E uw is also associated with a timestamp attribute t , and t v  X  V u and v j  X  V w . Each edge in E uu is associated with a frequency attribute r , and r between user v i and user v j , v i  X  V u and v j  X  V u .

For ease of illustration, we present an example in Fig. 5 . User u community graph by means of retweeting for modeling community relations of microblogs. result, the overall computation cost is O (| V t || E |).

Time-Sensitive Random Walk improving the measurement of node relevance by considering temporal aspects. 6.1. Measuring temporal correlation
Random walk defines transition probabilities P ( v i | v j is defined as: where P ( v i | v j ) depends on weight functions of directed edges and their attributes. Towards edge e probability P ( v i | v j ) mainly depends on its timestamp attribute. the same viewpoint being quite close together in terms of time.
 starting from node w 1 transmits to other tweet nodes via node u associated edge weight. Therefore, the random particle from node w contribution to e u 1 w 2 than edge e u 1 w 3 , because the timestamp of e following equation where Tweet ( v i )={ v k | e ik  X  E uw , v i  X  V u } is all tweets of user v between timestamp t ij and t ik .
 between different tweets, time decay functions are used for defining weight functions based on timestamps. exactly satisfies our above assumption about temporal aspects. where  X  can adjust the curve shape of the logistic function, c Considering temporal aspects of tweeting, the effective correlation function is defined as follows: where  X  t =| t ij  X  t ik |,  X  t represents the duration between tweet v 6.2.

The computation cost of temporal correlation is O (| E of E . Hence, the overall computation cost of TSRW is still O (| V versions of both algorithms can achieve significant speedup over the single thread version on large graphs. 7. Graph clustering based on RWR 7.1. Graph clustering based on nearest neighbors Algorithm 2. Node relevance computation by TSRW.
 this section, we use RWR to measure neighborhood similarities between nodes. In Eq. 1,therelevancevector s using RWR corresponds to its local neighborhood in a large graph. We transform the relevance vector s (k-NN) of v i ,namely NN k ( v i )={ u 1 , u 2 , ... , u k 7.2. Incremental Random Walk to its neighbor nodes in dashed lines. NN 5 ( v )={ u 1 , u the local neighborhood of u 3 may change because the new path { u influenced nodes in the local area can allow us to avoid expensive re-computation of the whole large graph.
