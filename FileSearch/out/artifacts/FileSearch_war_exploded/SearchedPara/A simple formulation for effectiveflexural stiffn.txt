 fl exural and shear stiffness of reinforced concrete (RC) members. Therefore 1. Introduction reinforced concrete (RC) members primarily by reducing their fl exural and shear stiffness. Linear elastic analysis of RC structures without considering the cracking effect or using constant coef -cients given in some current codes for cracking may not represent actual behavior of RC members.
 for the seismic design and performance evaluation of RC structures, effective fl exural stiffness of RC members (beams, columns and shear walls etc.) stemming from concrete cracking can be calculated usually by reducing their moment of inertia to speci fi ed values or using some empirical formulations. These equations do not take into account the most important parameters affecting the inelastic behavior of RC members such as con fi nement, axial load level, section dimensions and material properties of concrete and reinfor-cing steel ( Dogangun, 2013 ).
 stiffness with these major parameters will not represent actual behavior of the structures. It can be observed as an important deviation in periods of structures and inelastic displacement demand of earthquake. That will cause faulty determination of seismic perfor-mance of the structures.
 fl exural stiffness, EI eff , of RC members. While some of them have ignored the most important paramet ers affecting ductile and inelastic behavior of RC elements, others have proposed very complex and not practical formulations. Because of these reasons it is highly important to propose a formula consisting of both features being simple to be used easily in practice by design engineers and including the parameters representing actual behavior of RC members. primarily load dependent, may occu r at service loads and reduce the fl exural and shear stiffness of RC members. The effective stiffness of a structural concrete column is signi fi cantly affected by cracking along its length and by inelastic behavior of the concrete, reinforcing steel, and structural steel. EI eff is, therefore, a complex function of a number of variables that cannot be readily transformed into a unique and simple analytical equation ( Tikka and Mirza, 2008 ). usually carried out by linear elastic models which either neglect the concrete cracking effect or consider it by reducing the stiffness of members arbitrarily. It is also quite possible that the design of tall reinforced concrete structures on the basis of linear elastic theory may not satisfy serviceability requirements. For accurate determination of the de fl ections, cracked members in reinforced concrete structures need to be identi fi ed and their effective fl exural and shear rigidities determined ( Dundar and Kara, 2007 ).
In the design and seismic performance evaluation of RC structures, the moments of inertia of the beams and columns are usually reduced at the speci fi ed ratios to compute the lateral drift by considering the cracking effects on the stiffness of the structural frame. The gross moment of inertia of columns is generally reduced to 80% of their uncracked values while the gross moment of inertia of beams is reduced to 50%, without considering the type, history and magnitude of loading, and the reinforcement ratios in the members ( Stafford-Smith and Coull, 1991 ).
In Eurocode 8 (EC-8), the stiffness of the load bearing elements of RC buildings should be evaluated taking into account the effect of cracking corresponding to the initiation of yielding of the reinforcement. It is advised that the elastic fl exural and shear stiffness properties of concrete and masonry elements may be taken to be equal to one-half of the corresponding stiffness of the uncracked elements ( Eurocode-8, 2004 ). It can be said that dimension, concrete compressive strength, reinforcement of sec-tions and axial force acting on the sections are ignored and just given a constant coef fi cient.

In Turkish Earthquake Code 2007 (TEC-2007), there are some empirical formulae to consider the effective fl exural stiffness of cracked sections in modeling of buildings. Parameters to calculate EI eff are related to the axial force acting on column, cross-section area and compressive strength of the concrete. It should be noted that reinforcing ratio of the section is ignored.

Several studies have been conducted to determine the effective fl exural stiffness of RC columns. Avsar et al. (2012) have studied effective fl exural rigidities for ordinary RC columns by performing a parametric analysis of the sectional response of a wide range of column sections. Using a multilinear regression analysis they have proposed a parameter,  X  eff , representing the ratio of effective fl exural stiffness to uncracked fl exural stiffness of the section. The proposed equations for  X  eff yield better results for the members with lower concrete strength and longitudinal reinforcement ratio at any axial load level. Thus, they are recommended to be used in the evaluation of older-type structures having inadequate reinfor-cement with low strength concrete.

Tikka and Mirza (2008) have made a statistical research on effective fl exural stiffness of slender structural concrete columns to develop a general equation that could be used to compute EI of both reinforced concrete and composite columns by using a multilinear regression analysis. With the proposed formulae they have tried to improve ef fi ciency of EI eff equations given in The Canadian Standards Association (CSA) code for the design of concrete structures.

The aim of this paper is to introduce a simple formula as a securer, quicker and more robust to determine the effective fl exural stiffness of cracked sections of circular RC columns. This formula has been generated by using genetic programming (GP). The advantages of GP based formulation are attributed to its simplicity and usage for different kinds of structural engineering problems for which suf fi cient experimental results exist. The results from GP based formulation are compared with TEC-2007 and EC-8. It is demonstrated that the GP based model is highly successful to determine the effective fl exural stiffness of circular RC columns.

GP is one of the soft-computing approaches and a relatively new form of arti fi cial intelligence. Since it was fi rst proposed by Koza (1992) , GP has garnered considerable attention due to its ability to model nonlinear relationships for input  X  output map-pings. In recent years, the GP has been effectively applied in many engineering applications ( Gandomi et al., 2010; Ashour et al., 2003; Cevik et al., 2010; Soh and Yang, 2000; Chen et al., 2012 ).
Gandomi et al. (2010) have proposed a novel approach for the formulation of elastic modulus of both normal-strength concrete (NSC) and high-strength concrete (HSC) using a variant of GP, namely linear genetic programming (LGP). They have developed the models based on experimental results collected from the literature and carried out a subsequent parametric analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of the elastic modulus to the compressive strength variations. They have exposed the LGP results to be more accurate than those obtained using the building codes and various solutions reported in the literature.
 Ashour et al. (2003) have investigated the feasibility of using GP to create an empirical model for the complicated non-linear relationship between various input parameters associated with RC deep beams and their ultimate shear strength. They have con-structed the GP model from a set of experimental results available in the literature. They have showed the predictions obtained from GP agree well with experimental observations.

Cevik et al. (2010) have studied the use of GP to model RC beam torsional strength. They used experimental data of 76 rectangular RC beams from an existing database to develop the GP model. They have compared the accuracy of the codes in predicting the RC beam torsional strength with the proposed GP model using the same test data. They have concluded that the proposed GP model predicts RC beam torsional strength more accurately than building codes.

Soh and Yang (2000) have described a GP-based approach for simultaneous sizing, geometry, and topology optimization of structures. They have presented an encoding strategy to map between the real structures and the GP parse trees. They have revealed that the proposed approach is capable of producing the topology and shape of the desired trusses and the sizing of all the structural components. They have also discovered that this approach can potentially be a powerful search and optimization technique in solving civil engineering problems.

Chen et al. (2012) developed a weighted GP system to construct the relation models between the aseismic capacity of school buildings, and their basic design parameters. They constructed numerical models to obtain aseismic abilities of buildings and simulated stress responses and behaviors of the numerical models based on the structural con fi guration and material properties of buildings. They suggested this system to predict the aseismic capacity of the school buildings.

In this study, a simple formulation is proposed for  X  eff called as effective fl exural stiffness ratio which is the proportion of effective fl exural stiffness ( EI eff ) to gross sectional ( EI 0 ) of RC columns through the following steps: (i) Moment curvature relationship of several commonly used circular rein-forced concrete sections is obtained by using a cross sectional analysis program, XTRACT, (ii) the data to perform GP analysis are produced by taking into account the most important parameters affecting EI eff of RC columns, (iii) a GP-based analysis is conducted to estimate  X  eff accurately, (iv) the GP-based estimates are com-pared with the numerical study results, EC-8 and TEC-2007 and later the performance of the proposed formulae is veri fi 3-D building by a pushover analysis, and (v) fi nally the results are presented in graphical form. 2. Overview of moment  X  curvature relationship
The behavior of an RC member subjected to bending or com-bined bending and axial load can be understood if the moment curvature relationship is available. By studying this relationship one can predict the strength and the stiffness, as well as the ductility characteristics of the cross-sections ( Ersoy et al., 2008 ).
The curvature which is one of the geometrical parameters representing deformation is de fi ned as unit rotation angle. It is the derivative of the inclination of the tangent with respect to arc length ( Fig. 1 ).

 ated using equilibrium and compatibility equations and material models. With the aid of computers it is possible to use more realistic material models, and consider strain hardening in steel and step by step cover crushing ( Ersoy and Ozcebe, 1998 ). 3. A cross sectional analysis program for moment  X  curvature relationship relationship. Moment  X  curvature relationships of the sections used in this study are obtained by using a cross sectional analysis program named XTRACT which is a fully interactive program for the analysis of any cross section. It can generate moment curva-tures, axial force  X  moment interactions, and moment  X  moment interactions for concrete, steel, prestressed and composite struc-tural cross sections. It can handle the input of any arbitrary cross section (even with holes) made up of any material input from the available nonlinear material models (XTRACT and User Manual). crete section derived from XTRACT and its bilinearized curve are fi gured in Fig. 2 . 4. Genetic programming (GP) and its basis is the same Darwinian concept of survival of the fi ttest. GP creates a population of solutions whose genotypes are programs symbolized by tree structures. The main goal of GP is to solve a problem by searching highly fi t computer programs in the space of all possible programs. The aim of this approach is to obtain global optimum solutions by keeping many solutions that may potentially be close to minima ( Ashour et al., 2003 ). solving approach in which computer programs are evolved to solve, or approximately solve, problems based on the Darwinian principle of reproduction and survival of the fi ttest and analogs of naturally occurring genetic operations such as crossover (sexual recombination) and mutation. GP reproduces computer programs to solve problems by completing the steps in Fig. 3 . As can be seen from Fig. 3 , GP augments computer programs by executing the following steps: 1) Generate an initial population of random compositions of the 2) Execute each program in the population and assign it a 3) Create a new population of computer programs. 4) The best computer program that appeared in any generation, study, GeneXproTools program which has been developed by
Candida Ferreira is used. 5. Numerical study circular reinforced concrete columns which have different dimen-sions and/or reinforcing con fi gurations ( Fig. 4 ). To train and test the
GP model, training and testing sets are generated. For this purpose; 370 circular reinforced concrete column sections which have different geometrical properties, longitudinal and transverse rein-forcing con fi gurations, concrete compressive strength and subjected to different axial loads were composed and they were designed according to both Turkish Earthquake Code (TEC-2007) ( TEC-2007, 2007 ) and Turkish design and construction code for reinforced concrete structures (TS-500) ( TS-500, 2002 ). Different axial load combinations were selected by following requirements of those codes (Eqs. 3and4 ): N dm r 0 : 50 A c f ck  X  TEC 2007  X  X  3  X  N r 0 ; 6 A c f ck  X  TS 500  X  X  4  X  where N d and N dm are the axial force acting on the section, A area of the section and f ck is compressive strength of concrete.
The compressive strength of concrete sections used in this study is selected as a variable from 10 MPa to 30 MPa. Additionally minimum yield and rapture strength of reinforcing bars are 420 MPa and 550 MPa respectively. Mander concrete model ( Mander et al., 1988 ) was used for con fi ned and uncon concrete in compression. The stress  X  strain relationship of reinfor-cing steel is taken from TEC-2007 and that is widely used in literature. It is assumed that plane sections remain plain after bending and the bonding between reinforcing steel and concrete is perfect. The shear deformation of the section is neglected.
Moment  X  curvature relationship of those sections was deter-mined by using XTRACT and it is de fi ned as a bilinear curve with 4 parameters illustrated in Fig. 4 . Consequently EI eff of sections was obtained and the data for GP analysis were created. 370 data in total are randomly divided into two parts as the training and testing sets. 333 data from database are selected as training set and employed to train GP based model. Remaining 37 data, which are not used in the training process, are selected as the testing set and used to validate the generalization capability of GP based model. The maximum and minimum values of input and output parameters are given in Table 1 . The testing set is tabulated in Table 2 .
 f cm is 28-day compressive strength of concrete.  X  t is the long-itudinal reinforcing steel ratio and  X  w is the transverse (volu-metric) reinforcing steel ratio.
 evaluate how well the GP optimizer performs convergence graphs for both training and testing sets are given in Figs. 5 and 6 . The best fi tness for testing sets corresponding to 0.0014 of mean squared error, 0.8896 of R -square and 0.0380 of standard deviation values are obtained around 700 ( Fig. 6 ).
 in this study has three different kinds of crossover which are tabulated in Table 4 . 6. Results and discussions unique formulae have been proposed. The fi rst main one was obtained from GP analysis and called as proposed formula (PF), the other was produced empirically by effectively simplifying the one and named as simpli fi ed proposed formula (SPF).

In literature it is dif fi cult to fi nd a formulation to compute directly. Also in TEC-2007, instead of calculating  X  eff directly, it is given different relations with other formulae and necessary to make linear interpolations for intermediate values. Therefore this is a pioneering study that  X  eff can directly be calculated by PF and SPF formulae. Moreover if it is necessary to calculate EI easily computed by multiplying  X  eff with EI 0 already known from section properties.

EC-8 and TEC-2007 do not consider some of the most impor-tant parameters affecting fl exural stiffness of RC members. While in EC-8 it is just given a constant coef fi cient;  X  eff  X  tion consisting of axial force acting on column, cross-section area and compressive strength of concrete is given to calculate TEC-2007. Both of codes do not take into account the effect of reinforcement. However PF and SPF formulae proposed in this study consider all of parameters that have been mentioned above.
According to EC-8; the elastic fl exural and shear stiffness properties of concrete elements may be taken to be equal to one-half of the corresponding stiffness of the uncracked elements.
In TEC 2007,  X  eff can be calculated by using following equa-tions. where EI 0 is uncracked fl exural stiffness of the cross section. A linear interpolation should be made for intermediate values of N
Proposed formula (PF):
Simpli fi ed proposed formula (SPF): Variables given in Eqs. (7) and (8) are as follows: A c is the area of the section, N d is axial load acting on the section and f compressive strength of concrete. division of total area of longitudina l reinforcing bars by section area. the (volume of transverse reinforcement)/(volume of concrete). It is also the reinforcing ratio in the two principal orthogonal directions added together ( XTRACT and User Manual ).

In this study, in order to determine the fi tness of the given specimen for PF, statistical results of mean squared error (MSE), R -square ( R 2 ) and standard deviation (SD) are calculated. These results are tabulated for the proposed and current code based formulae in Table 5 . The closeness of the standard deviation and MSE to zero and R -square to 1 shows the fi tness of the formula ( GeneXproTools ).

It can be clearly seen in Table 5 that PF gives more accurate results than both TEC-2007 and EC-8. The convergence difference of SPF to PF can be ignored since as well as PF, SPF yields more accurate results than the design codes. R 2 of EC-8 cannot be calculated because it cannot be taken other than 0.5 value. There-fore it is given as not a number (NaN).

Performance of  X  eff computed via PF, SPF, EC-8 and TEC-2007 have been demonstrated by numerical XTRACT analysis results through Figs. 7  X  10 in which the closer circles to the diagonal line mean the better result. It can clearly be seen that performance of the proposed formulae in this study are highly effective than EC-8 and TEC-2007 in terms of convergence to exact  X  eff values.
In addition, the results are compared with the results of numerical study performed by using XTRACT and illustrated for testing set in Fig. 11 . As can be seen from Fig. 11 , PF and SPF results agree well with the XTRACT results and it can be said that they can represent effectively actual behavior of RC columns. 7. Case study 6-story RC building, a 3D modal analysis along with a static pushover analysis have been performed by using  X  eff computed by EC-8, TEC-2007, PF, SPF and analytically determined EI
XTRACT. Plan view of 6-story RC building with 3 m story heights is given in Fig. 12 . There is a concrete shear wall core area at the middle of the building and diameters of circular columns are 50 cm. Additionally the compressive strength of concrete sections is 20 MPa and minimum yield and rapture strength of reinforcing bars are 420 MPa and 550 MPa respectively.  X  eff of beams and shear walls were determined by cross sectional moment  X  curva-ture relationship and taken the same for all cases in order to see the real performance of the proposed formulae on the circular columns.
 over analysis. Periods and pushover curves of the building in principal directions X and Y are compared with each other separately (mode shapes of X and Y directions are determined as effective modes by providing modal participating mass ratio higher than 70% of total mass of the building). Convergence percentage performances of the proposed formulae and other design codes with respect to analytically determined  X  eff in Tables 6 and 7 for the principal directions.

In order to acquire pushover curves of the building for each case, a pushover analysis is performed by applying the steps given in TEC-2007. For each case, nonlinear spectral displacements are obtained by modal displacement demand. Following, a new push-over analysis is performed until the nonlinear spectral displace-ment and fi nally the real pushover curves are obtained. The pushover curves in principal directions are compared in Fig. 13 and obtained nonlinear spectral displacement results and theirs convergence percentages are tabulated in Table 8 . It can be seen from the Fig. 13 and Table 8 that the proposed formulae represent almost actual behavior of the building. 8. Conclusion
This paper deals with the validation of the formulae which are basedonGPtocalculatetheeffective fl exural stiffness ratio, circular RC columns under axial force and bending moment. It is a pioneering study in this fi eld in terms of taking into account the most important parameters affecting fl exural stiffness of cracked sections. Theproposedformulaeconsiderthecon fi nement, axial load level, section dimensions and material pr operties of concrete and reinfor-cing steel to determine effective fl exural stiffness of circular RC columns. In this respect it will also close the current codes de
The sections designed according to both TEC-2007 and TS-500 are analyzed by XTRACT to generate moment  X  curvature relation-ship of the sections. In so doing the data for GP analysis are created. Following the analysis an explicit formulation for the effective fl exural stiffness ratio of circular RC columns is proposed. To acquire a simpler formula to be able to use in preliminary design for hand calculation the proposed formula is effectively simpli fi ed as a SPF. The results obtained from the formulations are truly competent. The generalization capabilities of the explicit formulae are con fi rmed and compared by the numerical study results. In addition they are veri fi ed on a 3-D building model to see ef fi ciency of them. The proposed explicit formulations are very simple, easy to use and can predict effective fl exural stiffness ratio, eff , of circular RC columns in an effective manner. Moreover, one of the advantages of PF and SPF formulae is that they do not have of any complex operations. Thus the new proposed PF and SPF formulae can be easily used in practice and employed to any programming language to determine effective fl exural stiffness of circular RC columns.

This paper also demonstrates how robust GP is. Therefore it can be used conveniently for an analytical formulation could not be obtained from the mathematical models and the results of expe-rimental and numerical studies.
 designed with respect to both TEC-2007 and TS-500 codes requirements there is no limitation for the input variables of PF and SPF formulae. As a result the proposed PF and SPF formulae can be conveniently used in design codes for the seismic design and performance analysis of existing and new structures. References
