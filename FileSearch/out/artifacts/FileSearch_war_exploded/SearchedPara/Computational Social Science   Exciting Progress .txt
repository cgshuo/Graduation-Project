 The past 15 years have witnessed a remarkable increase in both the scale and scope of social and behavioral data available to researchers, leading some to herald the emergence of a new fiel d:  X  X omputational social science. X  Against these exciting developments stands a stubborn fact: that in spite of many thousands of published papers, th ere has been surprisingly little progress on the  X  X ig X  questions that motivated the field in the first place X  X uestions concerning systemic risk in financial systems, problem solving in complex organ izations, and the dynamics of epidemics or social movements, among others. In this talk I highlight some examples of res earch that would not have been possible just a handful of years ago and that illustrate the pr omise of CSS. At the same time, they illustrate its limitations. I t hen conclude with some thoughts on how CSS can bridge the gap between its current state and its potential.
