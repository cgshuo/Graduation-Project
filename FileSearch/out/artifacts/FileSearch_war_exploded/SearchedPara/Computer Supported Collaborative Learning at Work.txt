 We propose an interdisciplinary workshop to explore collaborative learning in the wo rkplace. The workshop X  X  theme is, simply  X  X SCL at work X . The ACM Group conference is an ideal venue for a workshop on this topic because the North American and European communities who participate in Group include leading members of the international CSCL and CSCW communities. The proposed workshop will be a full day. It will open with a situating presentation by the organizers and be followed by topically oriented small group breakout sessions. To participate in the workshop, di scussants will be asked for a position paper of up to 4 pages in standard ACM format. Up to The workshop will conclude with a decision on next steps. We have an outstanding book proposal with Springer on this topic, and an edited book is one possible next step. H5.3. [Group and Organization Interfaces] Computer supported cooperative work. Design, Economics, Huma n Factors, Theory CSCL, CSCW, collaboration, coop eration, wor kplace learning We propose a workshop exploring th e uptake and use of computer supported collaborative learning in work settings. This workshop will bring together researchers with a natural affinity toward the ACM Group conference to share examples of CSCL at work and an edited book or journal special issue. A number of existing works provide empirical research on collaborative work practices [4; 6], the sharing of information at work [2], and the development of communities of practice in workplace settings [9]. Others examine the munificent variation of information and communication technology use in the work place, including studies of informal social networks, formal information distribution and other socio-technical combinations found in work settings [5]. Another significant thread of prior work is focused on computer supported collaborative learning, much of it investigating the application of computer support for learning in the context of traditional educational institu tions, like public schools, private schools, colleges and tutoring organizations. Exciting new theories of how knowledge is c onstructed by groups [7], how teachers contribute to collabora tive learning and the application of socio-technical scripts is emerging from workplace studies [1; 3; 8]. We distinguish CSCL at Work from prior research conducted under the aegis of training and de velopment, or human resources more broadly. The workshop aims to fill a void between existing discourse in CSCW and CSCL, and will open with a short presentation by the organizers, characterizing the emerging application of collaborative learning theories and practices to workplace learning. CSCL and CSCW research each make distinct and important contribu tions to the construction of collaborative workplace learning. There are significant practitioners. Researchers will n eed to consider how CSCL at work is designed for and studied. What are the theoretical and methodological implications of the cases presented, and where do they take this emerging research space? Practitioners will be compelled to rethink how workplace training is conducted, and how more collaborative learning strategies could contribute to higher performance, faster transfer of technology from research and development to product and changes to other significant output measures. Our workshop aims to begin the process of identifying and describing the different manifestati ons of collaborative learning at work, following three patterns we have observed in our own nascent studies of CSCL at work , and through the solicitation of short workshop papers from other researchers in the field. A description of the three patterns of CSCL at work that we have observed is warranted here. First, there is the use of collaborative learning to bring new employees into existing teams. This is distinct from the legitimate peri pheral participation observed by Lave &amp; Wenger [6] and later described by Wenger as communities of practice [9]. In the case of CSCL at work, collaborative learning to brin g new employees into a team includes tutoring, layered introduc tion to information resources of the team, progressive granting of access rights to the tools the team relies on and ultimately the full rights and privileges of a team member. There is a mutual recognition on the part of the new person on the team that this training is a component of doing complex work that spans multiple socio-technical systems. Software developers, engineers and scientists are among those who progress through this type of CSCL at work. Second, we have noticed a patter n of CSCL at work used to accelerate technology transfer from research universities to industrial practice. Organi zer Jahnke has observed these phenomena with teams in the field of material science on her current project, Telemetric Online-Learning at Production Engineering. Organizer Goggi ns has observed these phenomena in computer science and engineering technology transfer. Third, CSCL at work is used as a formal device for sustaining competitive advantage in fast changing, high technology industries. Engineering, research and technology service firms are especially likely to utilize computer-mediated training that goes beyond textbooks, recorded powerpoint lectures and prepared material. In contrast with traditional workplace learning, focused on task oriented, practice oriented or regulatory compliance objectives, CSCL at work recognizes that the nature of innovation is interwoven to the seam that bi nds work and learning together. In some respects, this is the tradition of university education: The integration of learning and research. In proposing this workshop, we argue that this intersection is now prevalent at work, and this prevalence should be recognize d through research. The line between collaborative work as research and collaborative learning is blurred. Our experience is that this is especially common when researchers, engineers or designers contribute to CSCL efforts aimed at those who apply their inventions. Global economic upheaval framed by socially disconnected financial management practic es, financial information obfuscation, volatile commodity prices, and an increasing need for energy define the grand social setting for this workshop. It is a time of unique peril and opportunity that will draw upon diverse research communities for solutions. In this context, learning is no longer an activity that is separate from work. Learning at work is also about more than acquiring ne w information to perform a task, but about developing new knowledge to help a firm, an organization or a government improve its services in socially measurable as well as economically measurable ways. Three goals motivate the proposal for this workshop: 1) To identify and discuss examples of CSCL at work, 2) To identify theoretical and methodological commonalities 3) To further define the constituency of researchers who share The workshop will commence with a brief talk (approx. 30 minutes each) by the organizers.
