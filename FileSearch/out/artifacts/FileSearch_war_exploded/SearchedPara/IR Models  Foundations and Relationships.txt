 In IR research it is essential to know IR models. Research over the past years has consolidated the foundations of IR models. Moreover, relationships have been reported that help to use and position IR models. Knowing about the foundations and relationships of IR models can significantly improve building information management systems. The first part of this tutorial presents an in-depth consoli-dation of the foundations of the main IR models (TF-IDF, BM25, LM). Particular attention will be given to notation and probabilistic roots. The second part crystallises the re-lationships between models. Does LM embody IDF? How  X  X euristic X  is TF-IDF? What are the probabilistic roots? How are LM and the probability of relevance related? What are the components shared by the main IR models? After the tutorial, attendees will be familiar with a consol-idated view on IR models. The tutorial will be illustrative and interactive, providing opportunities to exchange contro-versial issues and research challenges.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Retrieval Models Theory, Algorithms TF-IDF, Language Modelling, BM25, Relationships The introduction of the main IR models includes: TF-IDF, VSM (Vector-Space Model), G-VSM (Generalised VSM), PRF (Probability of Relevance Framework), BIR (Bi-nary Independence Retrieval, RSJ (Robertson-SparckJones) weight, Laplace-like estimation of probabilities), Probabilis-tic Inference Networks (PIN), Poisson and 2-Poisson, BM25, DFR (Divergence from Randomness), and LM.
 This part will consolidate the main foundations following from [15] (probabilistic retrieval, BIR model), [5] (missing Visiting Professor at Yahoo Research Barcelona  X  BIR and TF-IDF: BIR can be used to explain TF-IDF; this views IDF as an approximation of the BIR/RSJ weight for the case of missing relevance, [14, 6].  X  TF-IDF, LM and Poisson: There are relationships that follow from being precise about the event spaces [16, 18, 10], e.g. probabilities based on document frequen-cies of terms, or based on token occurrences of terms.  X  PRF, TF-IDF and LM: Recently, [2],  X  X owards a bet-ter understanding of the relationship between proba-bilistic models in IR X , investigated some controversial aspects regarding the relationship between PRF (prob-abilistic odds), TF-IDF and LM.  X  PRF and LM: There is an early view on the relation-ship between LM (language modelling) and the PRF (probability of relevance framework) [9] which is ad-dressed and criticised in [10].  X  PIN X  X  and TF-IDF and LM: A relationship between
LM and PIN X  X  has been pointed out in [11]; this rela-tionship builds upon the earlier work [20, 22, 21] dis-cussing the relationship between PIN X  X  and TF-IDF; The tutorial makes explicit that X  X here is as much LM in TF-IDF as there is TF-IDF in LM X . TF-IDF has probabilistic roots. The duality of TF-IDF and LM marks TF-IDF as a model, not just as a weighting scheme in the VSM; the VSM is a  X  X ramework X  to express models [17].
 Also, the tutorial looks at the statement  X  X n LM, the es-based on the term frequency X . Moreover, the tutorial will review that LM is based on P ( q | d ) /P ( q ), and what makes the relationship between LM and the probability of rele-vance P ( r | d,q ) [9]. Finally, the tutorial will include con-ducive interpretations of the renown BM25 TF quantifica-tion tf / (tf+ K ) [3, 26, 19]. After the tutorial, the participants will have their view on statements such as X  X e know that LM works, but we do not know why  X ;  X  X F-IDF is intuitive, LM is not X ;  X  X F-IDF is heuristic, whereas LM has a probabilistic semantics X .
 In summary, the tutorial is structured as follows: Th omas Roelleke is a senior lecturer at Queen Mary, Uni-versity of London. His research expertise lies in IR Mod-els &amp; Theory and Probabilistic DB+IR. Currently, Thomas is a visiting scientist at Yahoo Research, Barcelona Media. Thomas has presented IR model tutorials at German sum-mer schools, taught MSc modules on Foundations of IR, and published several IR model &amp; theory papers.
