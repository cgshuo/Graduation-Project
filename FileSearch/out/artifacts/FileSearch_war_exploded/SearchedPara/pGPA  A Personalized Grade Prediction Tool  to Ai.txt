 Many educational institutions are starting to make use of their scholastic data to improve the academic experience for their students. To aid in this endeavor we have developed a research prototype implementation of a co llaborative filtering-based tool called the personalized Grade Prediction Advisor (pGPA). The goal of this prototype tool is to demonstrate the potential of recommender technology by providing grade predictions for upcoming courses in a student X  X  academic career to support decision-making for administrato rs, students, educators, and academic advisors. In this demonstration we briefly describe the underlying technology and potential applications of pGPA. We then present how a user can inte ract with pGPA to produce and interpret personalized grade predic tions for an individual student or group of students.

Algorithms, Design, Experimentation Collaborative filtering, Grade prediction, Student success, Software tool Recently, recommender technology has seen application in many domains including the academic realm [1]. One major problem in the educational sphere that has been the focus of such research is improving the educational experience and success rate of students in higher education. Researchers have used recommender technology to predict the likelihood of student dropout [2], help student s select appropriate majors, minors, and classes [3], and identify learning patterns and performance [4]. We set out to design and build our own recommender technology-based tool to help individuals at all echelons of the academic system make appropriate and well-informed decisions. The result of our efforts is a collaborative-filtered recommender system that utilizes past student performance, temporal elements, and contextual information to predict a student X  X  grades for the upcoming semester. We have developed this concept into a tool we call the personalized Grade Prediction Advisor (pGPA). The prototype of pGPA is designed to showcase the effectiveness of our approach to wards reliably predicting student grades. This prototype allows users to select a subset of students from the dataset we have, determine the semester to predict grades for, configure the prediction properties, and then displays the results to the user. In a ddition, this prototype provides a means of examining how these pred ictions could be used by the proposed stakeholders of pGPA to help guide their decision-making. Underlying Technology: pGPA is a collaborative-filtered recommender system that uses an individual X  X  academic history in the form of grades earne d and important temporal and contextual information such as when these grades were earned and how many hours the students carried during each semester to predict a student X  X  grades. We ultimately chose to implement both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient as the similarity metric in the pGPA prototype. We leave decisions such as the number of items and minimum similarity th reshold used for the prediction calculation to the user in order to highlight the impact that different criteria have on the prediction capability of this system and allow for experimentation and tweaking in the future. Potential Applications: The final version of pGPA is designed to be a software tool that can be adopted and used by academic institutions to help improve decision-making at all levels. We examine some of the potential uses of pGPA for each of our stakeholders to highlight how pGPA X  X  grade predictions can provide value to Students, Instru ctors, Academic Advisors, and Administrators. schedules to account for the am ount of work they will likely need to do in order to succeed in the upcoming semester. Additionally, the knowledge of what grade a student may receive in a course could provide motivation to work harder and achieve more in order to push a borderline grade to the next level. Students may also use th eir grade predictions to add or drop courses in a semester to improve their chances for success. students X  needs and individual deficiencies to help create personalized assignments for students. They may also be able to identify and recommend additional groups or resources for students that may be able to help the student improve his or her grade. for students because these predictions may represent vital information about a student X  X  chance for success that the advisor may not be aware of without extensive experience. These predictions may also help the advisor to convince a student to re-examine his or her schedule in order to improve the chances for success.
 curriculum, administrators can identify likely dropouts or low Administrators can also use the predictions made for a set of students in an intervention or study program to identify the effectiveness of such programs and allocate funding accordingly. Lastly, administrators can utilize the fact that they employ pGPA to improve student success rates in their school for marketing purposes. To demonstrate pGPA we utilize a dataset that encompasses 10,000 grades earned by 600 Computer Science students in a university over a 20 year time fr ame. The steps below outline how a user can utilize this data in pGPA to produce and evaluate grade predictions and what potential advice pGPA may administer for its target stakeholders. The user selects a set of students to make predictions for. This can be done by selecting a range of student performance and inputting the number of students to make predictions for or by selecting individual students from a list. The user can then examine the selected data to determine if it is acceptable. The user then identifies the period to make predictions for. The pGPA prototype then displays general information like the number of students who took courses during that period and the number of courses that this prediction will include. The user then has the option of changing the parameters of the predictions mechanism chosen. This will include settings like the number of nearest users (user-based) or items (item-based) or the minimum similarity thre shold used in the prediction calculation The user will be presented with several graphics that characterize the predictions. If desired, the user can also view a summarization of the factors that influenced the prediction. The pGPA prototype displays po ssible advice that could be recommended to the stakeholders such as (in the case of a student)  X  X ou should either remove a course from your proposed schedule or make sure you have a lot of study time scheduled so that you can improve your chances for success X . We have demonstrated the resear ch prototype tool called pGPA using a real-world academic datase t. This tool can be used to investigate various prediction strategies and it can be developed into a software package that higher education institutions can utilize to improve student success. We plan to test this tool with other datasets, add more features, and refine the prediction mechanism. We will also explore the commercialization and adoption of this tool. We sincerely thank Dr. K. Sohn for the dataset.
