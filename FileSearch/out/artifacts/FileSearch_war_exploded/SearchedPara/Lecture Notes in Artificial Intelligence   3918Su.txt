 The Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD) is hosted PAKDD 2006 in Singapore again, since the inaugural PAKDD conference was held in Singapore in 1997. 
PAKDD 2006 continues its tradition of prov iding an international forum for results and practical development experiences from all aspects of KDD data mining, visualization, and data mining applications. Asia, Australasia, North America and Europe, of which we accepted 67 (13.4%) papers as regular papers and 33 (6.6%) papers as short papers. The distribution of the accepted papers was as follows: USA (17%), China (16%), Taiwan (10%), Australia (10%), Japan (7%), Korea (7%), Germany (6%), Canada (5%), Hong Kong (3%), Singapore (3%), New Zealand (3%), France (3 %), UK (2%), and the rest from various countries in the Asia Pacific region. The large number of papers was beyond our anticipation and we had to increase the Program Committee at the last minute in order to ensure that all papers went through express herewith our deep appreciation to all PC members and the external reviewers for their arduous support in the review process. 
PAKDD 2006 made several other progresses giving the conference series more under Springer X  X  Lecture Note series. The organizers of the four workshops, namely BioDM, KDLL, KDXD and WISI, put together very high-quality keynotes and workshop programs. We would like to express our gratitude to them for the tremendous efforts. PAKDD 2006 also introduced the best paper award in addition to (PREMIA) of Singapore, a data mining competition under the PAKDD flag was also organized for the first time. Last but not least, a one-day PAKDD School, similar to the one organized in PAKDD 2004, was held again this year. 
PAKDD 2006 would not have been possible without the support of many people and organizations. We wish to thank the members of the Steering Committee for their preparation, we lost Hongjun Lu, who had helped us immensely in drafting our inspiration to make PAKDD 2006 a success. We also deeply appreciate the generous Research, the Asian Office of Aerospace Research and Development, and the U.S. Army ITC-PAC Asian Research Office. 
Last but not least, we want to thank all authors and all conference participants for their contribution and support. We hope all participants took this opportunity to share and exchange ideas with one another and enjoyed the conference.
