 J. David Johnson * 1. Introduction ...it is an unruly literature: publications on information needs, uses, and seeking sprawl across many academic disciplines, using dozens of overlapping concepts with varying definitions that, at times, conflict with one another. The findings of many thousands of study are difficult to compare, much less synthesize (Case, 2002, p. xv ).

Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in human information behavior (HIB) in part attributable to the rapid development of the Internet and associated information technologies. Concomitantly there has been substantial growth in theoretic frames, research, and substantive models. However, these efforts have often been fragmentary, resting on dif-ferent epistemological and ontological assumptions, dependent on the goals of disparate disciplines that are interested in differing aspects of information behavior (Case, 2006; Dervin, 2003 ). In this essay I will map various theoretical approaches by detailing their positioning on quadrants formed by the continuums of avoidance/acquisition and accidental/purposive behavior. The resulting mapping into four quadrants has important implications for the central theoretical problems of con-texts, rationality, and ignorance. Approaches to HIB often have been rooted in the most rational of contexts, libraries, where individuals come with a defined problem, or information technology systems, that have their own inherent logic. Attempts to apply this work to everyday life contexts often run into disquieting findings related to the benefits of ignorance and the seeming irrationality of human information behavior (Spink &amp; Cole, 2001 ).

Here I will primarily focus on the element of human information behavior that has received the most enduring and substantial academic attention  X  information seeking. However, to understand it fully it must be juxtaposed against other conditions of HIB. Wilson (2000, p. 49) defined information behavior as  X  X he totality of human behavior in relation to sources and channels of information, including both active and passive information seeking and information use. X  Infor-mation seeking can be defined simply as the purposive acquisition of information from selected information carriers (Johnson, 1996, 1997 ). Information carriers may include a variety of channels, a variety of sources within channels, and a variety of messages contained within these sources. There are many, often contradictory senses of information, I will focus here on the classic one of being able to discern patterns of matter and energy in the world around us (Johnson, 1997). 2. Mapping human information behavior
Before turning to debates and developments in the information behavior literature, we need to map the broad outlines of the current state of the field, which can help us to understand the areas that have been relatively understudied and what remains as terra incognita . Two fundamental axis, which rest on fundamental organizing issues in the literature, should serve to map the coordinates for purposes of this essay (see Fig. 1 ). The vertical axis is determined by the relation of the individual to information, with information needs often characterized by inner motivational states ( Case, 2002, 2006), and whether people desire to acquire information at one end or are motivated to avoid it on the other. The hor-izontal axis is determined by the relation of the person to the carrier of the information and whether their encounter with information is purposive or accidental, another recurring issue in information seeking research ( Case, 2002, 2006; Johnson, 1996; Williamson, 2005 ).

The vertical axis is fundamentally associated with issues of motivation and desire, the generative motors of information seeking. Acquisition is typically privileged in Western, especially US cultures, with action seen as more virtuous than pas-sivity, two key words in Wilson X  X  (2000) definition of human information behavior. Action is also imminently visible and detectible in our research, in some ways it is the figure in the classic figure-ground problem. It is also associated with the most potential change, the central policy issue in administrative research, since active search processes may lead individuals to be much more receptive to any information they acquire, resulting in a greater likelihood of knowledge gain, attitude change, or behavior modification (Johnson, 1996, 1997 ). An important corollary of this is dogged persistence until a high quality answer is found as the ideal search behavior. This is also the realm of curiosity (and even of obsession). In general, avoidance is seen as almost cowardly, and at the very least slothful.

The horizontal axis focuses on the underlying issue of intentionality, the extent to which individuals have rational ap-proaches to their behavior in relation to carriers, a central component of information behavior ( Case, 2002, 2007 ). The right (in more than one sense) end of the continuum implies teleology and a design to select particular carriers. The left (on the other hand) implies randomness, chance, and fate. Any exposure to useful information on this side of the continuum is seen as fortuitous and haphazard, with metaphors (e.g., berry picking, browsing) often used to describe human information behavior on this side of the axis.

Here I will paint the field in very broad strokes, focusing impressionistically on emerging issues, debates, and controver-sies. While it has become fashionable to conduct very systematic reviews, especially meta-analysis, by their very nature they are limited to established, well developed areas. Here I seek to define unexplored, less developed areas by detailing place-ment of theories within classic dimensions of HIB. I seek to orient us to where we are based on my tacit understanding of this literature based on over three decades of exploration, represented most exhaustively in my three books in this area (Johnson, 1996, 1997, in press ), so that we might identify new areas of inquiry. For a more comprehensive perspectives, there are many excellent reviews and book length treatments of very specific issues associated with the state of the art of theory in this very broad area ( Case, 2002, 2006, 2007; Fisher, Erdelez, &amp; McKechnie, 2005; Jarvelin &amp; Wilson, 2003; Johnson, 1996, 1997; Pet-tigrew, Fidel, &amp; Bruce, 2001; Pettigrew &amp; McKechnie, 2001 ).

Generally we have been oriented as a field to the upper quadrants of Fig. 1 , especially the right hand side that focuses on information seeking, which deals with, in its very definition, the purposive acquisition of information. For example, most studies of occupational information seeking have focused on engineers, scientists, scholars, and managers ( Case, 2002, 2007), with Case suggesting  X  X e already know enough about scientists X  (Case, 2007, p. 296 ). Theories and research focusing on this quadrant may not be easily extended to other quadrants below the horizontal in the map in Fig. 1 and few attempts have been made to develop more encompassing approaches (Case, Andrews, Johnson, &amp; Allard, 2005 ). The recent Everyday
Life Information Seeking (ELIS) movement is a shift away from this quadrant, but we know very little, and have theorized less, about the other ones. 2.1. Mapping
Guiding the explorations here are the fundamental axis we choose to orient our maps. Ultimately the choice of axis de-pends on their heuristic value, just as an explorer could orient themselves to north and south or, alternatively, cold and warmth or light and darkness. I think this essay demonstrates the wisdom of choosing these two dimensions but others might see more value in others such as complexity or their linkage to individual or institutional well-being. Just as in weath-er mapping temperatures are not represented by points, but by gradients of varying degrees of steepness, the placement of theories on the map is inherently imprecise, since their various properties determine their relative spread, how much they  X  X leed over X  into other dimensions.

Naturally any attempt at mapping approaches to human information behavior involves some hubris and to a certain ex-tent involves a leap of faith on the part of the reader. However, if we have lost the place for broader, more impressionistic essays pointing to new, innovative directions, with an attendant discounting of the importance of judgment on the part of the individual researcher and disparagement of narrative reviews (e.g., Johnson, Scott-Sheldon, Snyder, Noar, &amp; Huedo-Med-ina, 2008 ); if we can only explore well plowed ground by very systematic meta-analysis techniques, we may have given up the future in order to reify the inertial forces of a body of literature. 2.2. Models
Models are a very popular means of representing complex processes by trying to capture their essential elements and the relationships among them (usually graphically). They represent a way of organizing (and simplifying) a body of knowledge to pave the way for more sophisticated and comprehensive theories. In general, theorizing in information behavior has been at the modeling stage (Case, 2007 ) with few associated empirical tests, although models are often inductively derived from grounded theoretic work (Wilson, 1999 ). Models force a user to make explicit their underlying approaches and assumptions, appealing to explanatory factors that may lead to prediction of certain outcomes. Despite their heuristic advantages models also have weaknesses: they may oversimplify processes and they may lead people to over generalize, without realizing the limitations of their tacit assumptions which I will try to uncover here. Most of the models developed to describe information seeking, the most well developed area theoretically, are in essence flow charts that describe the surface actions, in a sequen-tial fashion, that individuals take in their quest for information (Case, 2002, 2007; Johnson, 1997 ). Representatives of this type of flow chart model would include Schamber X  X  (1994) Information Retrieval interaction model; Saracevic, Kantor, Chamis, and Trivison X  X  (1988) General Model of Information Seeking and Retrieving; Marchionini X  X  (1992) Information
Seeking Functions; and Kuhlthau X  X  (1991, 2004) model of the Information Search Process. Flow chart models are narrowly constrained to the upper right quadrant. 1
Flow chart models, which are generally in the upper right hand quadrant, reducing their scope, have some compelling advantages. First, they do provide pragmatic guidance to designers of information systems which after all was often their original purpose. Second, they can help individuals construct a rational plan for a search. However, flow chart models also have many weaknesses. First, they assume that professional authoritative sources are the primary one X  X  consulted. Second, unfortunately these classic stage or phase models almost always run into problems empirically, since people do not engage in orderly, sequential, mechanistic approaches to problems. These models offer rational approaches to irrational problems, and as a result do not capture the  X  X looming confusion X  of the real world. Third, most of them (partly because of the absence of feedback loops) almost assume success and do not deal effectively with other outcomes, such as frustration arising from contradictory recommendations. Fourth, and most importantly, they often do not capture explanatory variables that might specify why people are engaging in information seeking in the first place, providing a sound theoretical basis for predicting changes in information seeking behaviors, and by extension, providing guidance for the design of intervention strategies.
While we have typically focused on our hardware, we know much less about the human  X  X oftware X , with a primary focus on rational forces.

Another popular approach is to lay out major components of the processes without specifying relationships between them in domain models. This also is a way of approaching developing typologies or categories of different issues or processes which need to be considered in the information seeking process. One representative of this approach is Burt and Kinnucan X  X  (1990) Information Model that specifies Internal Personal Actuality and Internal System (i.e., information technologies) Actu-ality as bridged by representations of each other represented by Cognitive Models (i.e., knowledge structures), Data Models (i.e., relational data bases), and Conceptual Models (i.e., user views).

In sum, even a casual perusal of this initial mapping reveals the state of the art has the rational, praxiological side covered, as steps in a search/process models, but we do not have a comprehensive understanding of all possible quadrants. Thus, there have been numerous calls to promote a deeper understanding of information seeking by studying it in a broader array of everyday life contexts. Determining clear linkages to contextual factors offers the potential of moving information seeking research from the descriptive, modeling level it has generally operated on to a more explicitly theoretical one. Thus, as researchers have extended their research on information seeking they have come to understand there may be a broader range of information behavior. Relatedly, there has been a growing appreciation of the three central, emergent theoretical problems that any promising developments in future modeling and theory building must confront: contexts, ignorance, and irrationality. 3. Contexts
Despite repeated appeals for contextual inquiry and sensitivity to context ... no one is exactly sure what is being requested or how to produce it ( Weick, 1983, p. 27 ).

A fundamental necessity of social action is that it must occur within a context (Johnson, 2003; Savolainen, 1993 ). How-ever, the persistent theoretical problem of accounting for individual action in a social context is seldom explicitly addressed and we are unaware of the different senses of context in use (Dervin, 1997 ). Especially lacking is the identification of  X  X ctive X  ingredients in the environment that trigger changes in information behavior ( Johnson, 2003 ). In general, in conceptualizing our world, we have a tendency to focus on objects rather than their grounds, focusing on information or technology, for example, rather than the contexts within which behavior is embedded (Johnson, 2003 ).

Generally there are three senses of context in use in information seeking research (Johnson, 2003 ). First, context is seen as equivalent to the situation in which an individual is immersed. Situational approaches to context seek exhaustive, objective descriptions, but do not typically move to explanations of what the linkage is, if any, between situational fac-tors and information behavior. Second, contingency approaches move toward specifying active ingredients (e.g., availabil-ity of information technology) that have specific, predictable effects on various processes. Moving beyond lists is the specification of limiting conditions (e.g., accessibility) for a middle-range theory that suggests the context in which sets of propositions are operative. Third, we have major frameworks (e.g., market exchange) for meaning systems or interpre-tation. In the end, it is essential to the development of any theory that we explain the conditions under which it applies, the fundamental problem that examining contexts addresses (Baker &amp; Pettigrew, 1999 ) with most information seeking models applied to the contexts in the upper right-hand quadrant of Fig. 2 which uses our basic distinctions to map several illustrative contexts.

My colleagues and I have developed a Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking (CMIS) that originally was intended of fit of the empirical tests suggested there was congruence within the system of variables specified in the model, the specific patterns of relationships suggested clear contingent effects. Tests of the model as a whole suggested it worked best with authoritative channels, such as doctors, which are the object of intense, goal directed searches ( Johnson, 1997 ). Comparing the results of the CMIS tests suggested that the level of rationality associated with the degree of programming and the stag-ing of the task, potential active ingredients in contingency approaches, produced different system states within the CMIS.
McGuire (1983) long ago argued that studying processes across multiple contexts was essential to advancing our under-standing of them. He also argued that it was even more important to study phenomena in widely different contexts, espe-cially ones where our hypotheses were unlikely to work. Thus, a contextualist might argue that any hypothesis is plausible in certain limited situations ( McGuire, 1983 ). In conventional inquiry the tendency is to ignore discomforting elements (e.g., the importance of accessibility to engineers) by focusing on the elements of a context that conveniently fit our explanations.
Certainly, the picture that would emerge from examining information behavior solely in one context would be a distorted one.
 While organizational information seeking has been a traditional focus of information science, the ELIS ( Savolainen, 1995; Savolainen, 2005 ), has drawn attention to the variety of domains in which information seeking occurs in our day-to-day lifes. This increased attention is reflected in the international Information Seeking in Context Conferences (e.g., Dervin, 1997 ).
Essentially, this movement argues that a broadened view of the contexts in which information behavior occurs can deepen our understanding of it (Baker &amp; Pettigrew, 1999; Savolainen, 1995 ). It also serves to suggest the active ingredients that may serve as the essential foundations of more sophisticated contingency explanations. In doing this, the things that do not change from context to context highlight what might be the invariant, the core, the essential being of information behavior.
Perhaps the simplest, most powerful, reason for focusing on context, on the ground of information seeking, is that we will never understand information behavior unless we do (Dervin, 1997 ). Further,  X  ... information is united with contexts, that is, it only has utility with the context X  ( Grover &amp; Davenport, 2001, p. 6). Thus, the relationship between context and information seeking is a problem increasingly viewed as a central issue in information behavior research (Cool, 2001; Dervin, 1997, 2003;
Johnson, 2003; Kari &amp; Hartel, 2007; Kelly, 2006; Pettigrew et al., 2001; Solomon, 2002; Sonnenwald, Wildemuth, &amp; Harmon, 2001; Talja, Keso, &amp; Pietilainen, 1999 ).

One specific conception of an information context is that of the information field within which the individual is embed-ded ( Cool, 2001 ). An individual X  X  information field provides the starting point for information seeking. It represents the typical arrangement of information stimuli to which an individual is regularly exposed (Johnson, 1996, 1997 ), the informa-tion resources they routinely use ( Sonnenwald et al., 2001 ). Individuals are embedded in a physical world that involves recurring contacts with an interpersonal network of friends and/or family. They are also regularly exposed to the same med-iated communication channels (company news bulletins, local newspapers, television news, and so on). The concept of field has a long tradition in the social sciences tracing back to the seminal work of Lewin (Scott, 2000 ) with interesting recent variants such as the information horizons (Sonnenwald et al., 2001 ), information grounds (Fisher, Durrance, &amp; Hinton, 2004), and small worlds (Huotari &amp; Chatman, 2001 ). In some ways the totality of someone X  X  information fields has analogs to the notion of social capital in that it describes the resources an individual has to draw upon when confronting a problem.
When individuals share the same information field they also share a context which provides the information grounds for further interaction (Fisher et al., 2004 ).  X  X he more contexts two people share, the closer they are, and the more likely they are to be connected X  (Watts, 2003, p. 116 ).

As individuals become more focused in their information seeking they change the nature of their information field to sup-port the acquisition of information related to particular purposes (Kuhlthau, 1991 ). In this sense, individuals act strategically to achieve their ends and in doing so construct local communication structures in fields that mirror their interests ( William-son, 1998 ) to scan their environment. Some of the most interesting early work in the area of social contexts for information behavior was done by Pescosolido (1992) who identified  X  X ascades X  or strings in the selection of interpersonal sources of health information. Disturbingly physicians were not cited by respondents in two of the eight interpersonal source clusters in her 1992 study, in spite of the focus on recent severe health episodes. Three of the eight patterns revealed single source consultations (e.g., physicians alone), reflecting the disturbing lack of persistence of individuals in seeking help for their medical problems ( Johnson, 1997 ).

Johnson and his colleagues ( Johnson, Andrews, Case, Allard, &amp; Johnson, 2006 ) have extended this formulation to the con-cept of pathways, the route someone follows in the pursuit of answers to questions. It is more dynamic and active, focusing on individual actions over-time in response sequences. This movement over-time may result in changing contexts that are the direct result of individual choice and a response to what an individual has uncovered and in this way has some parallels preferences, paths can uncover discordant sources of information, producing conflicts that must be resolved. Paths are con-tingent on what is found and how one reacts to this information and they may lead us to encounter unexpected ( Erdelez, 2004) or serendipitous information (Bjorneborn, 2005 ).

These different approaches imply different relationships between actors and their information environments and thus also encapsulate different views of the relationship between individual actions and contexts and the active role individuals can play in contextualizing. Fields could be seen as embedded in classic causal approaches to human action, while pathways reflect more modern notions of narrative and a search for typical patterns (Johnson et al., 2006 ). Similarly these conceptions in some ways represent the distinction between  X  X bjectified X  and  X  X nterpretive X  approaches to context ( Talja et al., 1999 ). 4. Rationality
The field of information behavior still struggles under the assumption that information behavior is highly rational ( Case, 2002) and goal-directed ( Spink &amp; Cole, 2006 ). Rationality may lie at the heart of some of the  X  X ubious assumptions X  embed-ded in the literature articulated by Dervin (1976) : there is relevant information for every need, it is always possible to make information available or accessible; and people make easy, conflict-free connections between external,  X  X bjective X  informa-tion and their own internal reality. Rationality essentially reflects acceptable reasons, causes, and explanations and is often deeply rooted in our technologies. The rational implies thinking, weighing, reflection, while irrationality reflects intuitions, emotion, and subjectivity ( Nahl &amp; Bilal, 2007; Pharo &amp; Jarvelin, 2006 ). However, there has been a move towards a more sub-jective view of human information behavior, especially in terms of relevance judgments of users ( Case, 2002 ). Referring to our touchstone mapping in Fig. 3 we see continuums characterized by unconscious or unfelt needs of which we are perhaps ignorant on the one end, represented by evolutionary biology notions of foraging (Jacoby, 2005; Pirolli &amp; Card, 1999 ), and heightened concerns with drive reduction on the other, with the other continuum reflecting taboos, conscious denial in the lower right quadrant and serendipitous discoveries and encounters in the upper left.

As we have seen before, much of the current information seeking literature is still based on the centrality of uncertainty reduction (Kuhlthau, 2004 ), essentially a drive reduction (Case, 2005), problem solving approach, which is accepted as fun-damentally rational. This is the underlying force of Dervin X  X  popular information gaps (Dervin, 2003 ) and Belkin X  X  (Belkin,
Oddy, &amp; Brooks, 1982 ) frequently cited ASK, anomalous states of knowledge, approach. As Kuhlthau (1991) has suggested gap-bridging moves beyond just uncertainty reduction and often encompasses considerable anxiety evoked in the individual when s/he faces unknowns. In these views mere ignorance, by itself, is not typically a motivator for information seeking.
People are only motivated to seek information when they both know that they are ignorant and the missing information becomes salient. So acquiring information is to be desired not merely for its instrumental value (i.e.,  X  X  X oing something X  about a potential threat) but also for its emotional value (e.g., feeling assured that the threat is not imminent). Problematic
Integration Theory ( Brashers, Goldsmith, &amp; Hsieh, 2002 ) and Uncertainty Management Theory (Babrow, 2001 ) have ques-tioned the assumption that humans always desire to reduce uncertainty. Uncertainty Management, in particular, offers a more sophisticated way of explaining avoidance because it highlights how people sometimes deliberately increase uncer-tainty (e.g., for stimulation, entertainment). Thus, the upper right hand quadrant may be the goal for individuals with high needs for growth. 4.1. Other motives
A limited number of theories challenge conventional rationality or at least suggest a need for a broader understanding of it; so attempts have been made to articulate less rational underlying motives for information seeking such as Zipf X  X  Principle of Least Effort ( Zipf, 1949 ) and Play Theory ( Case, 2002 ). The need for entertainment/stimulation has not received proper may also have an interesting twist in that the less effort that one spends the less likely they will be disappointed or regret the choice they have made, with maximizers who devote optimal effort more likely to be depressed, unhappy, experience regret, and be pessimistic ( Schwartz, 2004 ). With greater effort also comes greater responsibility for choices and more guilt for wrong ones (Schwartz, 2004 ). Indeed ignoring can be a very rational strategy, as can employing the least effort to arrive at an answer ( Case, 2002 ).  X  ... information and knowledge are rarely ends in themselves: they are rather means to ends X  (Dervin, 1998, p. 40 ). This is so for users, the general public, but it may not be so for researchers and designers who quite naturally project their own world views on others. From what frame are we going to view information behavior  X  the scientific, knowledge seeking frame that has classically been used, may not be the normative one of unconscious acting on simple principles constituting the routinized scripts of everyday life characteristic of normative behavior. Spink and Cole (2001) point out that ELIS is dri-ven by the need for coherence and the ultimate use of information is in the mastery of life.

Case et al. (2005) have systematically articulated why the avoidance of information may be very rational in particular situations where people have low-self efficacy. Similarly, face-threatening information about job performance may not be sought out ( Ashford, Blatt, &amp; VandeWalle, 2003 ). It may be perfectly rational, then, to avoid information when there is noth-ing one can do with the answers one may obtain. Lack of information seeking when confronted with disease appears irra-tional because this is when information could be most beneficial and result in reduced morbidity and mortality. Yet studies indicate that people are less likely to look for information as their proximity to cancer increases ( Schwartz, 2004 ).
If the threat is extreme, or if any potential responses are not expected to be effective, then an attractive alternative is to ignore the threat entirely, blunting out a stressful event (Miller, 1987 )  X  which in turn promotes consistency (Case et al., 2005).

The ultimate goals of rationality, may be to develop a sense of coherence, and a simple one at that, with satisficing the standard rather than maximizing (Bates, 2005; Pirolli &amp; Card, 1999 ). Many have argued that most people do not want a wide-range of options, in part because our cognitive limits for processing information have been exceeded ( Schwartz, 2004). In a related way, people may pursue information not for new insights, but for validation, legitimation, and reformu-lation ( Cross, Rice, &amp; Parker, 2001 ).
 A deeper understanding of rationality is needed to confront some common findings in the information seeking literature.
We tend to assume people will expend a lot of energy to attack important problems and will also make sure of the quality of sources and of answers  X  but they clearly do not (Case, 2002, 2006; Johnson, 1996, 1997; Johnson et al., 2006 ). Accessibility of sources is often key determinant of their use (Bates, 2005 ), even for heavily rational engineers (Case, 2002, 2006 ). Most theorists confront the world with a scientific model that implies exhaustive searching and testing to come to the correct con-clusion. However, most seekers will stop searching when they discover the first somewhat plausible answer to their query. It may, indeed, be deeply rational to preserve ignorance, to experience its many benefits ( Johnson, 1996 ).
 5. Ignorance
Ignorance and information seeking are inextricably intertwined concepts. Conventionally, given Western attitudes to knowledge and progress, ignorance is viewed as something that needs to be overcome. A critical corollary of this assumption is that acquiring information inevitably helps the inquirer (Case, 2002 ). We also have a taken-for-granted assumption that people correctly interpret and apply the information they acquire; however, Hersh and his colleagues ( Hersh et al., 2000, 2002) have found that a disturbing percentage of health professionals did not correctly interpret medical information they retrieved from medical information systems and, even worse, searching at times resulting in changing correct information to incorrect, extending a generalized concern for information literacy even to our most highly trained professionals. Even more disconcertingly, correct information often has little impact on critical decision-making because of group processes ( Cross et al., 2001 ).

Here I will define key terms, mapping ignorance into eight separate categories developed by Kerwin (1993) along the two fundamental dimensions in Fig. 4 . The things we know we do not know; the known unknowns have been the classic object of information seeking research. They have also been termed conscious ignorance or meta-ignorance ( Smithson, 1989 ). Perhaps more problematic are the things we do not know we do not know, the unknown unknowns. These are the things that are most likely to result in surprises and environmental jolts. Error, something we think we know, but do not, is most likely to be corrected through interactions with others, especially weak ties. False truths, are things that are unknown, but which we think we know. False truths often form the conventional wisdom that is the basis for ongoing interactions, still, they are at times erroneous views of the world, which some fundamental questioning might overturn. Denial represents things that are too painful to know so we do not. As we will see, individuals often have very powerful reasons for refusing to admit that something is true. Perhaps even more troublesome for social systems are taboos, things that societies agree should not be known by their members because they threaten their underlying premises. Most traditional cultures throughout history have been truth preservers, rather than truth pursuers, with information seeking permitted in only very limited, often highly personal domains. Forbidden knowledge (e.g., religious domains, shamans) is an area for which there are still significant pen-alties for individuals who engage in information seeking (Johnson, 1996 ).

The tendency to avoid, ignore or deny information has always been somewhat of an anomaly in human behavior. The idea of  X  X  X electing X  exposure to messages in purposive, planned ways naturally emphasizes the information that is selected , not that which is ignored , thus we have the classic figure/ground issues related to context, only we find that which is ignored is a much larger corpus than that to which we attend. Inevitably an individual will know much less than any social system of which they are a part. Indeed there is a growing gap between what an individual knows and what is knowable.

Most treatments of information tend to focus on its many benefits. Yet, it can be viewed as having many negative con-sequences. Conventionally, given Western attitudes to knowledge and progress, ignorance is viewed as something that needs to be overcome. Yet, in organizations sometimes ignorance is planned for and overcoming it may detract from efficiency and differentiated specialization goals, presenting organizations with a substantial dilemma. Ignorance persists because it is use-ful on several levels, if not a necessity for organizations and their members and in this way more deeply, subversively ra-tional. Indeed, the forces preserving ignorance may be far more compelling than those resulting in knowledge acquisition (Hersberger, 2005; Johnson, 1996 ). All of this suggests that ignorance may be sustained because of a deeper underlying ratio-nality associated with its many benefits. 6. Future directions
We live in exciting times, where the ability of people to assimilate information they find into coherent personal strategies is perhaps the critical modern survival skill. Never have the possibilities, the potential to gather information been greater.
Increasingly the limits that exist are human ones. As we expand our inquiries into human information behavior across a wide-variety of contexts we will have to increasingly understand our limits, which are directly related to the benefits of ignorance and our often seemingly irrational information behavior. Our theorizing has focused on the upper right hand quadrant in part because that is where the light is, especially in terms of technology and its latent assumptions of rationality, that often overwhelm broader views of everyday human information behavior. In part because of this, we have slighted cen-how a broader view of our social worlds can lead us to confronting the other quadrants and the policy implications for future information behavior research. 6.1. Social worlds
This discussion leads us into the social worlds of users which have tended to be viewed in an isolated, atomized way, but, to take the discussion full circle, information behavior is dramatically influenced by the social contexts in which people are embedded, especially when we broaden the definition of information behavior to include the giving and the sharing of information. Traditionally, in the US, there has also been more of a focus on individuals and their rational, cognitive attri-butes, down-playing the social worlds of interpersonal contexts. However, it is in these grounds, be it work, school, or social groupings that the increased fragmentation of our social worlds, entails exposure to at times discordant information (Huckfeldt, Johnson, &amp; Sprague, 2004 ).

These social worlds have three particularly interesting manifestations. First, we have various forms of agency in which people are charged to seek information for others, be it proxy information seeking or imposed queries (Fisher et al., 2004). Second, is the operation of groups in various forms  X  teams, Communities of Practice (Wenger, 1998 ), and so on.
The small worlds represented by groups also provide insights into what information will be valued based on ingroup X  X ut-group distinctions (Spink &amp; Cole, 2006 ). Some have gone as far as to suggest that group membership can be predicted based on an individual X  X  information seeking preference with suggestions that opinion leaders are information brokers at the edges of groups (Burt, 1999 ). Finally, is the brokerage of information by strategically placed others in social networks which have been variously termed liaison, opinion leaders, and structural hole brokers (Johnson, 2004 ).

Both the traditional opinion leadership and network role literature suggest that people seek out knowledgeable others in their informal networks for answers to their questions (Burt, 1999; Huckfeldt et al., 2004; Johnson, 2004 ). How people come to know who has answers to new questions they may have is a relatively understudied problem. One of the things that char-acterizes effective KM relations is knowing what the other knows and when to turn to them (Cross et al., 2001). This interest in social context is given additional impetus by the classic findings of the information seeking literature that people will seek information from interpersonal sources who: can summarize information for them in meaningful terms; are accessible; and that people are not terribly persistent nor sophisticated in their search behaviors (Johnson, 1997 ).

The move to social network theory in information science (Pettigrew et al., 2001 ) leads to a wealth of empirical findings and tools for describing human information behavior. For example, it is well known that often people emerge in central posi-tions in networks because they are sought out for the information they uniquely have (Johnson, 2004 ). The feeling of mas-tery, arising from active information acquisition, raises interesting questions of when the seeker becomes the sought after.
Often cancer patients find themselves bombarded with information from well meaning friends and relatives. At what point does a new cancer patient, gather, synthesize, and interpret enough information that they can mentor patients more recently diagnosed than themselves? How do people come to know who has answers to these sorts of questions in their social worlds? What scent do they give off in a foraging perspective (Pirolli &amp; Card, 1999 )? 6.2. Implications for policy
Individuals can only shape contexts, thereby contextualizing their worlds, if they understand active ingredients of con-texts and how they act upon them. In a pragmatic sense, there may be no richer area of study for individuals who desire to shape the world around them (and to understand how they are shaped by it) (Dervin, 1997 ), so an understanding of our social contexts is a key to developing appropriate policy solutions.

But our traditional Western focus on the individual also needs to be addressed for any policy recommendations to be seen as relevant to our broader cultural worlds. One curious omission, in this connection, is the individual X  X  existing knowledge base and the associated issues of purging, refinding, reusing, and forgetting. Operationally, disentangling passive acquisition of information, not even to mention retrieval of information from memory for experienced individuals, from information that has been actively sought, has been one of the most ticklish tasks for information seeking research ( Case, 2007 ). This has direct implication for perceptions of gaps and how visible information seeking is and how much it depends on institu-tional responses.

Many of the problems of avoidance, persistence, and accessibility can be addressed by improving individual X  X  self-effi-cacy, a major element of how people respond to threats by improving information literacy and expanding possibilities. In addressing these issues we must remember that first and foremost people want answers, while researchers and theorists are often more concerned with process. Ultimately society wants knowledge that can be acted on. It is only when our every-day life models fail that we are motivated into sense making and our goal is often to return quickly to a state where we have a few fundamental principles to guide us (that we do not have to think consciously about). Maybe the central question for us is what na X ve model of human beings we have, what ideologies we possess  X  do we project onto others our (scientists) own aberrant behavior. This is why it is critical to understand mapping. 6.3. Conclusion
Many issues confront practicing professionals in human information behavior  X  their relevance to practice, their changing institutions, the presence of competitors, the increasing concern with the bottom line (e.g., sponsored research), our standing in the larger intellectual community, and so on. Is our understanding of these threats sufficient to move us out of our small world (Fulton, 2005 ) and our own innovativeness capable of leading us to drop our tools (e.g., technology), as in Karl Weick X  X  (1996) classic description of the Mann Gulch disaster? Is it time to give up rationality and routine supported by traditional institutions, to construct innovative solutions to the forces that at times threaten to engulf us; moving into new quadrants to broaden our understanding of human information behavior and seeking, thus increasing our relevance to a broader world?
