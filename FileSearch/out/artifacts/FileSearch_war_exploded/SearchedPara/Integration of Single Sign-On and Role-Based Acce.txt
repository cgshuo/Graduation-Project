 Grid computing is a very complex environment in which all the systems connected to the Grid network have authentication and authorization schemes to protect their intruders. Recently, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) stressed the importance of access control for au thenticated users by declaring  X  Broken Access Control  X  to be one of the top ten most critical Web application security vulnerabilities construct a secure Grid system. 
Globus Toolkit [2] provides a Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) that provides fundamental security services such as single sign-on and access control. Globus AuthorizationDecision for authorization. However, there is no guidance on how each technology can be integrated. Thus, we propose another way of implementing single sign-on and integrating it with authorization. In our proposed method, SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language), which are recommended by OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) [3], play key solution roles in integrating single sign-on and authorization. 
In this paper, we propose an efficient architecture that integrates single sign-on and access control for Grid security based on SAML and XACML. 2.1 Single Sign-On and Access Control The SSO service acts as a wrapper around the existing security infrastructure that exports various security features like authentication and authorization [4]. To support single sign-on, the system collects all the identification and authentication credentials at the time of primary sign-on. This information is then used by SSO Services within the primary domain to support the authentication of the user to each of the secondary domains with which the user may interact. 
Access control either permits or denies user access requests by checking whether the user has permission to access target re sources. Recently, role-based access control has been emerging for use in Grid computing. In contrast with identity-based methods, a role-based access control policy (RBAC) takes user context into account, based rule base because RBAC puts users into groups and assigned roles. For this reason, roles can reflect organizational structure. Access control management of a role-based policy can be simpler and have a better scale than an identity-based system [5, 6]. 2.2 SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and XACML (eXtensible SAML is designed to offer SSO for both automatic and manual interactions between systems. It will let a user log into another domain and define all of their permissions, or it will manage automated message exchanges between just two parties. 
SAML enables the exchange of authentication and authorization information about XML, SAML defines the request-response protocol by which systems accept or reject subjects based on assertions, which are declaration of certain facts about a subject [7]. 
XACML is used in conjunction with SAML and supplements lacking access control policy in SAML. XACML can specify various targets, such as a resource, an entire document, a partial document, or multiple documents. It can even specify an XML element as the target to be prot ected. This aspect makes it possible to implement fine-grained access control. 
SAML can be bound to multiple communication and transport protocols. It can be linked with Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) over HTTP [7]. SAML operates without cookies in a browser/artifact profile. Using a browser/artifact, a SAML artifact is carried as part of a URL query string and is a pointer to an assertion. As we mentioned earlier, XACML provides an XML-based RBAC profile for the expression of authorization policies to build them into Web applications. We propose a practical model for transcribing the RBAC profile into XACML using some element identifies the set of decision requests that the parent element intends to evaluate. The &lt;Rule&gt; element defines the individual rules in the policy. The RuleCombiningAlgId is the identifier for the rule-combining algorithm by which the &lt;Policy&gt; components must be combined [5]. 
Figure 2 represents an instance of a user X  X  information, which is stored in a repository or database. 
Figure 3 depicts the rules applicable to the distributed resources based on the Policy execute a certain resource belong to this group. Box #2 specifies the condition that an information (Refer to Figure 2). In this polic y, whoever is authenticated by his ID and belongs to the Resident group can access any resource and execute any action to it. We propose an integrated architecture in which a user offers authentication credential information to the Grid system network to obtain user authentication and authorization and then access to another trusted system using this authentication and authorization, based on the SAML and XACML standard. Figure 4 explains the diagram denotes an entity involved in the process. Figure 5 explains the messages between entities, applying a user X  X  single sign-on and access control in three domains in which there is a mutual trust relationship. 
Figure 6 is an assertion statement issued by the SAML authority (refers to Step (4) of Figure 5). 
Figure 7 is an assertion statement issued by the XACML Component (refers to Step (19) of Figure 5). These messages were verified by a simulation where two domains were constructed with a mutual trust relationship and the SAML and XACML libraries, which were built from previous work [8]. With regard to security for Grid computin g, IBM and Microsoft are already leading in its standardization. Nevertheless, we recommended SAML as an alternative to the existing standards that they are promoting. SAML is also a standard technology for implementing single sign-on. Thus, our proposed architecture opens up the possibility that various single sign-on technologies can be adopted in constructing secure Grid computing. Additionally, we recommended XACML to implement role-based access control. Since XACML gives Grid computin g an efficient way to implement role-based access control, the difficulty of using the Globus toolkit for the convergence of standard technologies to implement role -based access control can be solved by XACML.
