 Massive quantities of digital data are being collected in every aspect of modern life. Examples include Personal photos and videos, biological a nd medical images and recordings from sensor arrays. To transform these massive data streams into useful information we use a sequence of  X  X innowing X  stages. Each step redu ces the size of the data by an order of magnitude; extracting the wheat form the chaff. In this talk I will describe this approach in a variety of contexts, ranging from the analysis of genetic pathways in fruit-fly em bryos and C-Elegans worms to counting birds and helping elderly people living alone keep in touch with their family and caregivers. Applications -Data Mining Yoav Freund is a professor of Computer Science a nd Engineering at UC San Diego. His work is in the area of machine learning, co mputational statistics and their applications. Dr. Freund is an internationally known researcher in the field of machine learning, a field which bridges computer science and statistics. He is best known for his joint work with Dr. Robert Schapire on the Adaboost algorithm. For this work they were awarded the 2003 Godel prize in Theoretical Computer Science, as well as the Kane llakis Prize in 2004.
