 Dear readers, As the new editor-in-chief, I am very proud to present this special issue of the ACM SIGKDD Explorations newsletter containing a guest edited selection of high quality articles on negative results in learning and mining, the reports of several highly relevant workshops held in the last year, and also some of the best papers of these workshops.
 With this issue, the role of editor-in-chief has fully transitioned from Osmar Za  X  X ane to me. The transition was easy to make as Osmar had made sure enough material was available to fill yet another interesting issue of this newsletter. I would like to thank Osmar for all his hard work, and for making my previous role as associate editor a very pleasant one. Further, I am very happy that Charu Aggarwal agreed to continue as associate editor, as well as to announce that Srini Parthasarathy agreed to join the editorial team as associate editor. One of our main goals is to give the newsletter a more  X  X agazine X  style and to bring it to the next level . As in any computer game, however, this also means that things will get more difficult, and hence, more lives will be neces-sary. Therefore, we are looking for additional associate editors to take care of new sections, such as, for example, Trends and Controversies (cf. Intelligent Systems), Research Centers (cf. SIGMOD Record), or others, some of which we hope to be able to introduce in the forthcoming issues.
 Already, this newsletter has a very high impact in our community, and numer-ous articles published here have received many citations. As Osmar pointed out in the editorial of issue 10(1), while many regard the newsletter as a technical journal, it essentially is not. The newsletter should cover new challenges, new trends, and recent developments in knowledge discovery, but also contain sur-veys, opinions, reports, and reviews; bringing topical and informative news and material to all members, researchers as well as practitioners, of our community. This of course does not mean it cannot contain any technical articles, but when it does, these should be of interest to the general audience of the newsletter. In my opinion, this newsletter should be for SIGKDD what CACM is for ACM in general. Obviously, this is impossible without your help, as you are both the authors and the readers of the articles we are after. So please, do not hesitate to contact us with your suggestions, comments, or questions.
 For this special issue, we welcome guest editors Christophe Giraud-Carrier and Margaret H. Dunham, who collected eight interesting articles on negative and unexpected results. Although negative results are typically regarded as not very exciting to report on, and even harder to get published at a conference or in a journal, negative results can be of great value to our community, as also stressed in the introductory article by the guest editors. I expect their recommendation for a more regular feature on carefully documented negative experimental results to find hearing in the community and I welcome further submissions on the topic to the newsletter as I feel it is indeed an excellent venue for such articles. The second section of this issue contains the reports of some of the workshops of the KDD 2010 conference in Washington: Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI-KDD), Multimedia Data Mining (MDMKDD), Discovering, Summarizing and Using Multiple Clusterings (MultiClust), Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data (SensorKDD), Novel Data Stream Pattern Mining (StreamKDD), and Useful Patterns (UP). This is followed by a report of the workshop on Mining and Learning with Graphs, which was co-located with the KDD conference in Washington, and of the workshop on Algorithms for Modern Massive Data Sets which was held at Stanford University in June of 2010.
 In the last section, we present selected articles of the KDD workshops Intelli-gence and Security Informatics (ISI-KDD), Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data (SensorKDD), Novel Data Stream Pattern Mining (StreamKDD), and Useful Patterns (UP).
 To conclude, I wish to thank the guest editors and all authors for their contri-bution and I hope you will enjoy reading this issue, as well as all forthcoming issues.
 Happy reading, Bart Goethals Editor-in-Chief December 2010 Antwerp, Belgium bart.goethals@ua.ac.be
