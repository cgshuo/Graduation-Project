 Traditionally, many system designs focus on achieving efficiency through worker X  X  standardized and uninterrupted operation. In this paper, I propose an alternative design approach: improving efficiency by transforming  X  X ipeline X  systems into  X  X ebble X  systems, i.e. reducing the constraints on workers X  actions and augment their activities of managing local contingencies and utiliz ing local resources. I further illustrate this approach through a research project in the warehouse, in which a desi gn vision was developed to transform the current pipeline system into a pebble system to improve efficiency. H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces  X  User centered design. H.1.2 [Models and Principles]: User/Machine Systems  X  Human factors. Design, system, user interface, interaction Design, Theory, Experimentation In recent years, more and more companies seek to improve productivity and gain competitive advantage through a redesign of their work system. Traditionally, system designs are built upon an  X  X rganizational view X , in which work practice is  X  X ssentially procedur al in nature X  [1]. Therefore efficiency is achieved through workers X  speed of performing standardized and predefined steps. However, actual work practice is chaotic and uncontrollable, full of  X  X emonically wild contingencies X  [2]. Accordingly, workers X  actions to carry out work practices are not only the standard and normative ones that can be found in a company handbook, but more importantly, workers adopt a collection of  X  X nstructured X  and  X  X nformal X  activities to deal with  X  X he particulars of actual cases X  [3]. Studies suggest that these activities are critical for getting jobs done in a system. Sachs X  research in a telephone company, for example, revealed that attempts to eliminate or restrict such activities with  X  X olitary commands X  would result in a decrease of efficiency [2]. We can compare how materials go through workers X  actions to a stream flowing through different steps. In this metaphor, a system that is built upon an organizational view functions like a pipeline: it not only defines the outcome of the stream (what job should be done), but also constrains its route with additional requirements (how the job gets done). I name systems of this nature as  X  X ipeline X  systems (Figure 1). In this paper, I propose an alternative approach for system design  X  transforming pipeline systems into pebble systems. Compared to a system built upon the traditional organizational view, this approach seeks to design a system that functions like the pebbles in a brook: they loosely define the general flow of the stream, but different routes are possible (Figure 1). Therefore in such a system, workers have more flexibility and support to manage real world contingencies, adopt different activities and utilize local resources to efficiently get their work done. This paper is built upon a three-month research of the distribution practice in a Dangaard International warehouse in Hammelev, Denmark in 2007. Dangaard International is Europe X  X  largest value-adding distributor. The primary functions of this warehouse include storage and fulfillment of items for online orders. This paper focuses specifically on the fulfillment part of their distribution practice. Products that are handled in this warehouse include cell phones of different brands, phone cards, and accessories. I will refer to these as  X  X tems X  in this paper. There is a computer system that assists the work in the warehouse. Each item and box is applied with a barcode, and the status of the item is updated in the computer system through the scanning of barcodes. New orders are displayed in the system as soon as they are placed online. All workers and managers have access to the database, so that they can keep track of the items and the work progress. The storage practice handles items that come into the warehouse from manufacturers, including registering them into the computer system, placing them onto the shelves, etc. The fulfillment practice, which is the focus of this paper, is responsible for picking item s according to specific online orders and preparing them for shipping. Currently, the fulfillment practice is carried out by three teams: picking team, postage team and wrapping &amp; sorting team. Each team has a team lead er, and the leaders report to a manager in charge of the overall coordination in the warehouse. Each worker in the picking team is equipped with a laptop and a trolley (Figure 2). The worker starts his job by picking orders from the computer system, which are then listed on his laptop. Entering each order, there is detailed information, including model, quantity and location number of the required items. Then, the worker goes to the corresponding storage cells in the shelves to pick the items, put them together in a box, and apply a box label. The worker needs to scan the labels on the items and the box to match them to the order. When finished with all the selected orders, the worker closes this job by scanning all the labels on the boxes. After that he transports the boxes to the postage area, where a worker from the postage team continues to work on the order (Figure 3). Specifically, the postage team worker weighs each box and types the weight into the computer manually. Then a delivery note and a shipping label are printed. The worker needs to check the items in the box against the delivery note to make sure that the correct items were picked. Then the worker seals the box with tape and applies the postage la bel. Finally, the boxes are transported to the wrapping &amp; sorting team to wrap the boxes and sort them according to their destination. Taking a quick glance at the fu lfillment practice, one might find it neat and organized. However, as I engaged deeper with workers X  daily practices, I found their practice far from being peaceful. Here I will use three real-life cases from the daily practice of Mads, a work er in the picking team, to demonstrate some problems with the current system. Mads was picking items for an order. When he was in the process of scanning the labels of three cell phones, the label of the box and the location label, a co-worker came to him and asked his help for  X  X omethi ng urgent X . Mads paused his scanning and said:  X  X ait a second; let me finish my work. X  Then he continued to finish scanning, but left one of the cell phones on the shelf, instead of putting it into the box. In the current system, the burden of aligning the item X  X  status in the physical and digital world is in the workers X  hands. Therefore, a worker has to go through a series of predefined steps, including activating the order, scanning the labels of the box, the items and the storage cell, and closing the job (Figure 4). When interrupted, th e worker could leave the item  X  X n-between X : the phone is pick ed for order in the computer system; while in the real world, the phone is still on the shelf. This would then become an error in the system. The warehouse is full of interruptions, change of priorities and shifting time lines. This conflicts with the design of the current system, which requires a smooth and uninterrupted operation to prevent errors. In addition, the interface design lacks a meaningful representation of the work progress to indicate actions for resumption. In this case, even if Mads paused his scanning work to offer help, he still would need to take on the cognitive burden of figuring out where he was in the scanning process when he came back to continue his work. This extra step obviously makes it hard for Mads to resume his work, not to mention the possibility of someone else completing the order. Mads was working on an order requiring a Nokia N70 and a Samsung T509. Mads checked the computer system, which suggested there was a Nokia N70 ready for picking in a storage cell in the front shelf. Mads went to that location, only to find out that there was no Nokia N70 there; instead, there was a Samsung T509 in that cell. Mads took out a small note pad, wrote down  X  X okia N70 X , and went to the main storage area in the back of the warehouse. There Mads found the guy in charge and explained that a Samsung phone was in the cell of Nokia N70s. Then Mads handed him the piece of paper and said:  X  X  can use this Samsung T509 for this order, but I still need a Nokia N70. X  The other person shrugged and said:  X  X ell, I can get you a N okia N70. But we need to fix the Samsung phone first. We need to find out where it should be and correct it in the system. X  Besides the order requirements, workers have an additional layer of constraint in their current practice: the item X  X  status should be perfectly  X  X orrect X  in the computer system as well. In this case, what the order calls for is a Samsung T509, it doesn X  X  matter which Samsung T509 it is. However, an item is not  X  X alid X  for orders if its physical status does not match with the computer system. Ther efore the workers had to go through all the effort to correct its status before using it. Mads was helping the postage team to finish some orders. He tried to activate an order by scanning the box label, but an error message popped up in the display. Mads scanned the label again, but still got the same message. Mads tried several different things to find out what the error was, but failed. Eventually, he had to find the worker who actua lly picked the items to help fix the error. There is a prevailing concern fo r correctness of the work in the warehouse. Currently, the strategy to ensure correctness is to separate the work of picking and postage in order to have more people to check for errors. As one of the team leaders pointed out:  X  X he postage area is to make sure that the right things are picked in the box, so [we have] two people check the box to make sure that [everything] is right. X  This strategy reflects the belief that workers are sources of errors, but ignores the fact that workers also have the capability to detect and solve problems. In this case, the separation not only failed to eliminate erro rs, it actually made problem solving even more difficult: since Mads did not have the context of previous work, it was hard for him to find out the cause of the error, not to mention solve it. Another thing that adds to the difficulty of problem solving is the lack of useful feedback in the interface; ther efore errors are very often detected long after their creation. The current system forms a pipeline structure in many ways. The most relevant constraint for the fulfillment practice is the order requirements, e.g. m odel and quantity of items. However, the current system places additional alignment constraints which require a flow of 14 rigid steps (Figure 4). These steps have a low tolerance for interruptions, which is inherently contradictory with the practice in the warehouse. Furthermore, the system attempts to drive the stream towards the desired outcome through constant checking, but fails to support the workers X  practice of solving problems. A design vision was developed from a participatory and iterative co-exploration with people from the warehouse, including workers, team leaders and manager. The vision of the new system was tested in the warehouse for a total of eight hours, where the workers and I trialed the new work practice with the prototype. The design improved the current fulfillment practice in thr ee aspects: work process, technology and the tool that assists fulfillment work. A key change in the work pro cess is to combine picking and postage work. There is no postage area anymore  X  instead, workers drop boxes with completed orders in the  X  X ropping spots X . The wrapping &amp; sorting team collects the boxes regularly during the day to get them ready for shipping. This change is realized by equipping the trolleys with two printers to generate the delivery note and shipping label when all required items are picked. In the new system, RFID replaces barcodes. Boxes and items are equipped with RFID tags, and each storage cell in the shelves has an RFID reader. Wh en the status of an item is changed (e.g. removed from the cell, applied to an order, etc.), it is reflected in the system directly and no extra operation is required. Many objects are involved in the distribution practice in the warehouse; I chose to develop a concept for the trolley because it is a critical tool in the fulfillment practice. The top surface of the new trolley functi ons as a touch screen, where an order list is displayed. The worker selects orders by clicking the icons of orders, after which the icons turn red (Figure 5). After accepting the order, the worker can continue to activate the orders he wants to work on immediately. Icons of activated orders expand to the size of a box. To work on that order, the worker  X  X ills in X  an icon with a box and required items (Figure 6). As soon as a box or item is put onto the icon, the digital system recognizes that it is applied to the order. If the item doesn X  X  match the order, the icon flashes red. If the worker moves and rotates the boxes on the trolley, the icons change accordingly (Figure 7). When all the required items are picked, the icon turns green. Then the printers generate the posta ge label and delivery note automatically. Both printouts stick out halfway, so the worker needs to take them out manually. If the worker forgets to apply the printouts, the display will freeze: it doesn X  X  react to any action unt il printouts are applied. The design seeks to improve workers X  efficiency by transforming the pipeline system into a pebble system (Figure 8). It tolerates imperfect situations and supports workers X  diverse actions. This is reflected in three aspects: facilitating meaningful interruptions, reducing constraints, and augmenting the practice of problem solving. The current system is designed for a smooth and uninterrupted work flow, which is unrealistic in the warehouse. In the new system, the item X  X  status is synchronized automatically in the computer system according to the worker X  X  actions. Therefore, the gap between actions becomes a meaningful stop that allows interruptions. The new interface facilitates resumption after interruptions by providing an overview of work progress. There is an information tag on both sides of the icon of an activated order. The tag displays information about the remaining work for this order, including quantity, model and location of required items. Therefore it not only communicates required actions to the worker who has been working on this order, but also to other people who try to help. Originally, workers have the burden of aligning an item X  X  status in the physical and digital world. Therefore they need to make sure that the items not only fit the order requirement, but are also aligned perfectly in the computer system. Misaligned items are treated as  X  X rrors X , and cannot be used for orders until corrected. As shown in Figure 8, in the new system, as long as the stream touches the pebble, it doesn X  X  matter which route it takes. This means any item that fits order requirement is a valid resource for this order. Consider the Samsung T509 in Case 2: in the new system, it is still  X  X isplaced X , because it appears in a cell that should only have Nokia N70 phones. But it is no longer an  X  X rror X  that prevents Mads from accomplishing his work, but rather a temporary discrepancy in the process that is not critical for getting work done. Now Mads is able to use the  X  X aulty X  Samsung T509 to complete the order. The current system desires the stream to flow one directionally towards the outcome. Therefore it emphasizes the need for error checking and overlooks the worker X  X  intelligence to solve problems. On the contrary, since the new system augments workers X  problem solving activities, it allows  X  X etours X  around pebbles (Figure 8, Route 2), i.e. the practice of diagnosing and fixing errors. By collapsing the picking work and postage work, the new system enables the same worker to follow the entir e process. Therefore, in the event of a problem or error, the worker can have a more contextual understanding to facilitate investigation. The new system also offers immediate detection by directly linking feedback to the worker X  X  operations: as soon as the worker makes an error with his order, he is notified by the flashing icon. In this paper I presented the approach of transforming pipeline systems into pebble systems to improve efficiency. This approach seeks to redu ce constraints on the workers X  practice by using a pebble structure and to augment their capabilities to deal with contingencies. This proposal does not seek to undermine the value of pipeline systems; but rather add value by combing it with a pebble structure according to job requirements: e.g. the freezing feature in the trolley prompts the worker to apply printouts, which constrains workers with a pipeline structure. But this feature effectively contributes to the work practice by ensuring the completion of an order. Prototypes of the new system were well received and created a lot of excitement when tested, but they have not yet been examined in a full-scale trial. Moving forward, a comprehensive trial would be needed further validate the approach.
