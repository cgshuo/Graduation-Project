 We present a preliminary analysis of #widebate, a hashtag to Wisconsin Gubernatorial recall election. Our analysis identifies the differences in discourse between the two debates. We find that only 14% of individuals particip ate in discourse surrounding both of the debates. Further, we identify differences in the way that the most active individuals in the discourse utilize syntactical features. Our findings contribute to the limited literature examining technologically-mediated discourse related to political debates. J.4 [Social and Behavioral Sciences]: Sociology Twitter, political discourse, social media, elections, civic engagement Civic debate has been one of the foundations of society throughout history. Electoral deba tes in the United States have evolved significantly over time and allow citizens to learn about candidates leading to more informed decisions [4]. Until the introduction of the Internet, analysis of citizen discourse related to debates relied on questionnaires, surveys and focus groups [5]. Twitter allows for examination of the public X  X  response to electoral debates in near real-tim e. Research that has examined Twitter in the context of electoral debates has focused on identifying topics of the debate [3] and the individuals and content of the debate [7; 8]. Much of this research has been situated in larger discourses that examine Twitter as a back channel to live TV discourse [2]. Although previous research has examined electoral debates in an attempt to identify topical content, no prior research examines the participants in the discourse outside the context of analysis of mentions in the tweet text [7]. Understanding how individuals contribute to the discourse is important in unders tanding how technology facilitates civic engagement. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was elected in November 2010, but faced a recall election on June 5, 2012. Governor Walker won the recall election by a 53%-46% margin. In the two weeks before the election, Gove rnor Walker debated his opponent (Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett) tw ice, May 25 and May 31. The hashtag #widebate was used to ma rk discourse pertaining to the debates on Twitter. We used the TwitterZombie arch itecture to query the Twitter SEARCH API every minute for tweets with the hashtag were collected. These tweets were divided into two datasets to examine the difference between the two debates. Tweets that occurred up until May 29 th at 12:00am were deemed to be associated with the May 25 th debate (n=10,958), while all of the tweets following that time were deem ed to be associated with the May 31 st debate (n=15,149). All analysis was done using custom-built R scripts based on previous work by the authors [6]. In total, 6,012 unique individuals contributed to the discourse using the #widebate hashtag, with 3,125 participating in the first debate and 3,780 participating in the second debate. Table 1 illustrates the syntactical feature utilization for the two debates. First Debate 10,958 21.30% 70.12% 5.18% 57.28% Second Debate 15,149 22.77% 65.77% 4.31% 53.11% We identified 893 individuals (14.9%) that participated in both of the debates. We coded these indi viduals who participated in both debates as: singletons (tweeted once in each debate), moderate (tweeted once in one debate and more than once in the other) or active (tweeted more than once in each debate). Table 2 illustrates the categorical distribution of the individuals that participated in both debates. A small percen tage (13%) of individuals participating in both debates only participated in each dataset once, while almost 50% of the individuals did so multiple times. To further understand the most prolific individuals in the two debates, we examine the top 10 contributors the two debates. There were only three individuals that were in the top 10 in both debates, illustrating diversity in participants in the debate discourse. Table 3 and 4 denote th e description, number of tweets in the dataset and the number of total tweets from when the account was first created through June 25 th , 2012 in the two debates. Individuals that participat ed in more than one debate are noted with *. User Description First Debate Conservative Citizen/Blogger 115 124,253 Conservative Citizen 104 3,596 Women's Rights Advocate 78 61,555 Education Advocacy Org * 72 9,307 Conservative Citizen * 61 14,903 Conservative Citizen 61 2,385 Conservative Citizen 58 13,365 Liberal Citizen * 57 23,677 Conservative Organizer 54 13,991 Progressive Political Blogger 54 292,825 We see that these individuals were not only active in the debate, but were heavy Twitter users. The number of tweets from each of the individuals ranged from 2, 385 -292,825 as of June 25, 2012 (mean = 36,277, median = 14,447) . These high numbers indicate that these individuals have sustained Twitter accounts and are familiar with the syntactical features of the technology.

Th e percentages represent the total usage of all of the 17 active members that we identified in Tables 3 and 4 from above. What is of mo st interest is that the most active users appear to use Twitte r differently than the overall population in the two debates. We see that active participants use links much less than the overall population and also use mentions and retweets less. First
Debate 698 Second
Debate 941 Looking at the change from the first to the second debate, the most significant change is the decrease in mentions and retweets along with the increase in @Reply X  X , illustrating conversational behavior by the most active member s of the dataset. Analysis of the tweets in the second debate illustrates that the tweets are significant contributions to the discourse. Each of the tweets averaged 15.5 words. This length coupled with the limited use of links or retweets and a preliminary analysis of the comments demonstrates that the indivi duals are providing substantive commentary. This poster is an analysis of the use of one hashtag in two distinct, yet related, events in a short tim e period. We see that only 14% of the total participants participated in both debates. Examining the most active individuals highlights some very interesting findings. First, analysis of the individual profiles indicates that none of the individuals who are the most active belong to a traditional media organization. This indicates that the most active individuals in the debates are citizens that are civi cally engaged. Second, we see that frequent contributors use Twitter X  X  syntactical features differently and these patterns cha nge between the two debates. Third, we see that the most active individuals are ideologically diverse based on their pr ofiles and comments. Our work contributes to the growing body of literature on backchannel communication. The local nature of the broadcast coupled with the national interest of the overall election provides an interesting context for examin ing discourse in a medium such as Twitter. This analysis helps to illustrate that social media tools may be vehicles for technologica lly mediated civic engagement, but further analysis is require d to understand how and to what extent.
