 Different important studies in Web search results clustering have recently shown increasing performances motivated by the use of external resources. Following this trend, we present a new algo-rithm called Dual C-Means , which provides a theoretical back-ground for clustering in different representation spaces. Its origi-nality relies on the fact that external resources can drive the cluster-ing process as well as the labeling task in a single step. To validate our hypotheses, a series of experiments are conducted over differ-ent standard datasets and in particular over a new dataset built from the TREC Web Track 2012 to take into account query logs infor-mation. The comprehensive empirical evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its significant advantages over traditional clustering and labeling techniques.

Web search results clustering (SRC), also known as post-retrieval clustering, multifaceted clustering or ephemeral clustering has re-ceived much attention for the past twenty years. SRC systems return meaningful labeled clusters from a set of Web snippets re-trieved from any Web search engine for a given user X  X  query. So far, most works have focused on the study of topical clustering [9] although some studies have been appearing in temporal clustering [1] and geospatial clustering [39]. As a consequence, SRC systems can be particularly useful to understand query intents (topical clus-tering) and query diversity (temporal/geospatial clustering). In this paper, we particularly focus on topical SRC.

As opposed to classical text clustering, SRC must deal with small text fragments (Web snippets) and be processed in run-time. As a consequence, it is hard to implement efficiently and effectively [9]. So, most successful methodologies follow a monothetic approach [40, 10, 12, 35]. The underlying idea is to discover the most dis-criminant topical words in the collection and group together Web snippets containing these relevant terms. On the other hand, the polythetic approach, in which the main idea is to represent Web snippets based on the Vector Space Model (VSM) has received less attention [18, 22, 41, 30]. The main reason is the fact that the la-beling process is a surprisingly hard extra task [9].

Our research is motivated by the fact that the adequate combi-nation of the polythetic and monothetic approaches in a single al-gorithm should lead to improved performance over three important factors in SRC: clustering accuracy , labeling quality and partition-ning shape . For that purpose, we present a new algorithm called Dual C-Means , which provides a theoretical background for dual-representation clustering. Its originality relies on the fact that dif-ferent representation spaces can drive the clustering process as well as the labeling task in a single step.
 We evaluated the proposed algorithm over different metrics (e.g. F 1 [13], F b 3 [2], ARI [37], D #-nDCG [34]), well-studied datasets (e.g. ODP-239 [10], SEMEVAL [28]) and different representation spaces (e.g. text and query logs). The results show that the com-bination of the VSM representation of Web snippets and a query-log-based representation of cluster centroids achieves the best con-figuration for the SRC task. In particular, increased performance is shown against most SRC solutions (e.g. STC [40], LINGO [30], TOPICAL [35], LDA [7]). Our main contributions are :
In the next section, we present the most important recent stud-ies for SRC. In the third section, we present the general model of the Dual C -Means algorithm and its instantiation in the context of SRC. In the fourth section, we explain the construction of the WEBSRC401 dataset. In the fifth and sixth sections, we present the experimental setups and show the results obatined for different strategies over an exhaustive set of well-known evaluation metrics, datasets and state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, we draw some conclusions about our experiments and propose new perspectives.
A good survey of SRC methodologies can be found in [9]. As a consequence, we give a brief overview of older methodologies and focus on more recent works. The first important work in SRC is certainly proposed by [18]. They define a polythetic approach based on the VSM representation where similarity between docu-ments is computed with cosine similarity measure. Then, a non-hierarchical partitioning strategy called fractionation is performed to discover the number of clusters suggested by the user. Initial re-sults show that their  X  approach to document clustering is one which can produce significant improvements over similarity search rank-ing alone  X . Although they present the foundations of SRC, labeling is not tackled and evaluation is based on a small dataset and a lim-ited user study.

In order to propose a more realistic solution, which includes la-beling, [40] defined the Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) algorithm. They propose a monothetic clustering technique, which merges base clusters with high string overlap. Instead of using the VSM representation, they propose to represent Web snippets as compact tries. Their evaluation over a small set of 10 queries shows that STC outperforms group-average agglomerative hierarchical clustering, K -Means, buckshot, fractionation and single-pass algorithms. STC is still considered as a hard baseline to compete with.
Later, [30] proposed a polythetic approach called LINGO, which takes into account the string representation proposed by [40]. They first extract frequent phrases based on suffix-arrays. Then, they re-duce the term-document matrix (defined as a VSM) using Single Value Decomposition to discover latent structures. Finally, they match group descriptions with the extracted topics and assign rel-evant documents to them. LINGO is evaluated with 7 users over a set of 4 search results and as such, no conclusive remarks can be drawn. However, their publicly available implementations of LINGO, STC and BiKM (Bi-section K -means) provide researchers with useful tools to build SRC systems.

More recently, [10] showed that the characteristics of the out-puts of SRC algorithms suggest the adoption of a meta clustering approach. For that purpose, they introduce a novel criterion to mea-sure the concordance of two partitions of Web snippets into differ-ent clusters based on the information content associated with the decisions made by the partitions on single pairs of Web snippets. A meta clustering phase is then casted to an optimization prob-lem of the concordance between the clustering combination and the given set of clusterings. The results of their OPTIMSRC sys-tem demonstrate that meta clustering is superior over individual clustering techniques. In particular, they propose a dataset called ODP-239, which is widely used in the community.

Another polythetic methodology is proposed in [26]. Their un-derlying idea is that informative text similarity measures can im-prove SRC by adequately capturing the latent semantics conveyed by Web snippets. They propose a K -means based algorithm called GK -means within which a new objective function defined for a third-order similarity measure must be maximized. As different partitions are possible depending on the K value, they propose an automatic stopping criterion to retrieve one  X  X ptimal X  clustering so-lution. Their main contribution is the fact that labels are built during the clustering process thus avoiding an extra processing step. Their results show improvements for ODP-239 in terms of F b 3 over all text-based SRC algorithms.

While all studies mentioned so far treat the task of SRC as a text-based problem, some other works propose to introduce external re-sources. The first relevant work is presented in [16] where Web snippets are enriched with anchor text information and high qual-ity indexes extracted from DMOZ. The underlying idea of their monothetic approach called SNAKET is that better labeling and clustering can be obtained from these external resources. Results over a non-standard dataset show that the introduction of external information improves Precision at different clustering levels. [16] certainly proposed a new trend in SRC.

Following the same idea, [35] proposed TOPICAL, a top per-forming SRC system over ODP-239 dataset. They propose to move away from the bag of words representation towards a graph of top-ics paradigm derived from TAGME, a wikification algorithm [38]. Each Web snippet is annotated with a set of topics, which are rep-resented by Wikipedia articles. A bipartite-like graph structure is built where nodes are either Web snippets or topics and edges are either topic-to-topic or topic-to-snippet. Then, a spectral-like clus-tering algorithm is run over the graph to discover relevant clus-ters and meaningful labels. TOPICAL is an interesting approach as clustering is driven by the presence of Wikipedia titles in Web snippets and inderectly assures the quality of the labeling.
Another idea has recently been proposed in [13], which relies on Web n-grams. In order to better capture the similarity between Web snippets, a first step consists in building a co-occurence graph based on Dice coefficient calculated over the Google Web1T cor-pus [8] from which senses are discovered by word sense induction algorithms. Each Web snippet is represented as a bag-of-words (polythetic approach) but Similarity is computed over discovered word senses. Their experiments show that enhanced diversification and clustering performance results can be obtained based on the adjusted RandIndex [37] for a specific dataset built for ambiguous queries (MORESQUE). Recently, researchers from the same team proposed a new dataset within the context of the SEMEVAL task 11 [28], in which the goal is to provide an evaluation framework for the objective comparison of word sense disambiguation and in-duction algorithms in SRC for ambiguous queries.

All works propose interesting issues for SRC. On one hand, the monothetic approach mainly focuses on the identification of strong meaningful labels. The underlying idea is that good labels are a key factor for the success of user experience in Web search. On the other hand, the polythetic approach concentrates on discover-ing high quality clusters and the labeling task is usually treated as a separate process. The subjacent motivation is that good cluster-ing should be provided to improve user experience in search for information. Moreover, recent studies show that the introduction of external resources improves overall results.

In this paper, we propose that both monothetic and polythetic approaches should be combined in a single algorithm capable of accepting external resources. For that purpose, we present the Dual C -Means algorithm, which extends the well-known K -Means for dual representation spaces. It particularity relies on the fact that dif-ferent representation spaces compete to reach high clustering qual-ity and meaningful labeling. In particular, we propose that query logs are introduced as external information to ensure quality label-ing and drive the clustering process. The main characteritics of our proposal are as follows:
This section is devoted to the presentation of the Dual C -Means algorithm that extends the classical K -means [21] for dual represen-tation spaces. In the first subsection, we present the general model and in the second one we propose its instantiation for the specific task of SRC.
Let S be a dataset to partition where each data s i 2 S is described on a representation space E 1 and additionally, E 2 denotes another space supporting cluster representation. We hypothesize the exis-tence of a function d : E 1 E 2 ! R + quantifying the dissimilarity between any data from E 1 and any cluster representative (cluster centroid) from E 2 . The new proposed clustering model (Dual C -Means) is driven by the objective criterion defined in Equation 1, which must be minimized.

As illustrated in Figure 1, the aim of the minimization of J is to find a partition of S into c clusters ( P = f p 1 ;:::; in each cluster p k any object is as closed as possible to a common cluster representative m k ( M = f m 1 ;:::; m c g ).
 Figure 1: Dual C -Means aims to discover clusters of objects in E closed to a common cluster representative in E 2 .

The optimization process can be achieved by an usual dynamic reallocation algorithm starting with a random initial clustering and then iterating the following two steps (Update and Assignment) until convergence: 1. Update: compute new optimal cluster representatives M t + 1 2. Assignment: compute new optimal assignments P t + 1 con-
Note that the update of cluster representatives has to be defined depending on both the dissimilarity measure d ( :;: ) and the repre-sentative space E 2 in order to ensure that the objective criterion J dcm ( :;: ) decreases. Let us also notice that in the specific case where E 1 = E 2 = R n and the squared euclidean distance is chosen as dissimilarity d ( :;: ) , the Dual C -Means algorithm comes down exactly to the usual K -means algorithm ( m t + 1 k =  X  s Finally, such as K -means, Dual C -Means is sensitive to random initialization and requires the number of expected clusters ( C ) as parameter 1 .
In the context of SRC, objects are naturally Web snippets repre-sented in the E 1 space ( s i 2 S ) and cluster representatives are labels represented in the E 2 space ( m k 2 M ).

The crucial hypothesis of the Dual C -Means algorithm is the ex-istence of a dissimilarity metric d ( :;: ) capable of comparing objects from different feature spaces. For that purpose, a matching process between the two feature sets is required that can be formalized as a transition matrix P ( p 1 p 2 ) quantifying this matching for each of the p 1 features defined in E 1 with each of the p 2 features from E
Without loss of generality, we define a generic dissimilarity mea-sure considering such a transition matrix in Equation 2 where m the transposed label vector, s i Pm T k quantifies a similarity between a Web snippet s i and a label m k , and a is a constant to adjust in order to ensure dissimilarity values in R + . Such a dissimilarity form allows us to rewrite the Dual C -Means algorithm as a maximization problem defined in Equation 3. Let us notice that when the label space E 2 is unconstrained (e.g. E But in the SRC context, a small set of words (i.e. the labels) are usually chosen to help the user in his search for information. Thus, we consider two vocabularies V 1 and V 2 defining the two feature spaces E 1 and E 2 respectively. We constrain Web snip-pet descriptions to be word distributions over V 1 ( s i ; j and  X  p 1 j = 1 s i ; j = 1) and cluster labels to subsets of p words from V ( E
Within that context, the computation of optimal cluster labels is a discrete optimization process solved for each cluster p dently, by first sorting the vocabulary V 2 from the most relevant defined in Equation 4 and then defining a cluster label vector m k as the combination of the p most relevant words from V 2 for the snippets in p k as proposed in Equation 5.
It is interesting to notice that the GK -means, recently proposed by [26], falls into such an SRC instantiation of the Dual C -Means algorithm if the following constraints are true:
These issues will be tackled in the Evaluation section.
To make use of the duality concept from the new proposed algo-rithm in the SRC context, we suggest differentiating the two vocab-ularies V 1 and V 2 . First, V 1 is defined as the bag of words occurring in all Web snippets retrieved for a given query. Second, if we con-sider a set Y of query logs, the vocabulary V 2 is defined by the bag of words occurring in Y and E 2 is restricted to the set of query logs defined as distributions in the vector space model induced by V This situation is formalized in Equation 6 with b i denoting the size of the query log y i .

As such clustering is polythetic but query log driven. Figure 2 illustrates the instantiation of the Dual C -Means algorithm in the SRC context where the restricted set of available query logs guides the cluster formation process.
 Figure 2: Example of the Dual C -Means instantiated for the SRC context with query logs as cluster label space. Different gold standards have been used for the evaluation of SRC algorithms among which the most cited are: AMBIENT [6], ODP-239 [10], MORESQUE [27] and SEMEVAL [28]. As ODP-239 is an evolution of AMBIENT and SEMEVAL is the next gen-eration of MORESQUE, we will only give an overview of the most recent datasets.

In ODP-239, each document is represented by a title and a Web snippet and the subtopics are chosen from the top levels of DMOZ However, this dataset does not represent the typical kind of results obtained through querying a given search engine as the number of possible subtopics is always equal to 10. It is clear that this structure clearly differs from a typical Web results set. Moreover, queries are not extracted from query logs but rather chosen based on the categories present in DMOZ. However, it is a publicly available dataset that allows us to conduct experiments to evaluate clustering accuracy. http://www.dmoz.or g [Last access: 27/01/2014].

On the other hand, the subtopics in SEMEVAL follow a more natural distribution as they are defined based on the disambigua-tion pages of Wikipedia. As such, these subtopics are likely to cover most of the senses present in the Web for the 100 evaluated queries. However, SEMEVAL is built to specifically deal with am-biguous queries, which are self-contained in Wikipedia. But, it is clear that not all queries in general are Wikipedia articles or am-biguous. For example, many queries are multifaceted but not am-biguous [19]. Let us take  X  X lympic Games X . Its Wikipedia entry is not ambiguous but it presents many different facets such as History, Logos, Year dates or Cities, to name but a few.

As a consequence, it is clear that different results can be obtained from one dataset to another. A quick summary of both datasets is presented in Table 1.
To afford a more realistic situation in the context of Web search results, we propose a new SRC dataset based on the ClueWeb09 Category B text collection (CCB) 3 , which comprises about 50 mil-lion English-language pages, including the entirety of the English-language Wikipedia and task descriptions of the TREC Web Track 2012. The goal of TREC Web Track 2012 is to return a ranked list of Web pages that together provide complete topical coverage of a given query, while avoiding excessive redundancy of the subtopics in the result list. In particular, each topic contains a query field, a description field and several subtopic fields which can be ambigu-ous or multifaceted. And for each topic, a judgement file (i.e. qrel) includes the list of relevant Web pages from CCB and the manually attributed grade of the Web page subtopic.

Instead of retrieving relevant Web pages, we are interested in obtaining relevant clusters (i.e. Web pages with the same subtopic) with high coverage of all the subtopics. So, we propose transform-ing the data available in the TREC Web Track 2012 in a typical SRC format [10], which result in the WEBSRC401 dataset 4 . First, for each Web page considered as query-relevant, its Web snippet is retrieved using the SnippetGenerator function of ChatNoir default, a Web snippet composed of a maximum of 500 characters found around the query words is provided.
 Secondly, for each query, its subtopics are defined as in the TREC Web Track 2012 and each qrel is encoded in a new format, which contains the Web page id, the subtopic id and the query 6 tionally, it is important to notice that the WEBSRC401 dataset fa-cilitates the evaluation of new techniques based on more complex resources provided by researchers as it is based on the well-studied ClueWeb09. For example, cluster ranking or spam cluster filter-ing studies could be endeavored with the PageRank scores and the spam rankings of ClueWeb09 dataset which are publicly available.
As mentioned in [9], evaluating SRC systems is a hard task. In-deed, the evaluation process is three-fold. A successful SRC sys-http://lemurproject.org/clue web09/ [Last access: 27/01/2014] http://websrc401.greyc.fr/ [Last access: 10/05/2014]. http://chatnoir.webis.de/ [Last access: 27/01/2014]. Note that these steps could be used to extend the dataset with the TREC Web tracks of the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. tem must discover relevant topical clusters ( clustering accuracy ) and propose meaningful labels at the same time ( labeling quality ). We will also see in our experiments that partition shape is also an important factor to study.
Firstly, a successful SRC system must evidence high quality level clustering. Ideally, each query subtopic should be represented by a unique cluster containing all the relevant Web pages inside. How-ever, this task is far from being achievable. As such, this constraint can be reformulated as for the TREC Web Track 2012: the task of SRC systems is to provide complete topical cluster coverage of a given query, while avoiding excessive redundancy of the subtopics in the result list of clusters.

Secondly, SRC systems should present meaningful labels to the user to ease their search for information. As such, the evaluation of the labeling task is of the utmost importance. As far as we know, only [10, 35] propose the evaluation of both dimensions. However, their experiments are not reproducible as they rely on manually annotated datasets, which are not publicly available.

Thirdly, SRC differs from classical text clustering as the parti-tioning shape, more precisely the distribution of the Web snippets into clusters, shows evidence of some particularity. Indeed, it is well-known that subtopics on the Web are not equally distributed. For example, for the query  X  X pple X , it is much more likely to find Web snippets related to the company than the concept of fruit. In particular, we will see in our experiments that not all evaluation metrics cover this situation.

In the next sections, we propose a complete set of repeatable experiments to give an exhaustive overview of the SRC field. We start by focusing on the experimental setups.
In this section, we propose the comparison of different configu-rations of the Dual C -Means to several state-of-the-art algorithms using well-studied evaluation metrics.

The originality of the Dual C -Means is to embody a great number of possible configurations due to the expressiveness of its model. In this paper, we will particularly focus on two main issues. The first one deals with using different similarity measures to compute the transition matrix P . The underlying idea is supported by the fact that different word similarity measures produce different re-sults [31]. As a consequence, we aim to understand their impact on the SRC task. The second one aims to test our initial hypothesis stating that the introduction of external resources can improve SRC. As a consequence, we propose two different space representations: text-text (i.e. V 1 = V 2 ) and text-query logs (i.e. V 1
The use of word similarity metrics is an important and inter-changeable component of our algorithm encoded in the transition matrix. In this study, we propose the comparison of a total of five collocation metrics 7 . In particular, we used the Symmetric Con-ditional Probability (SCP) [36], the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) [11], the Dice coefficient [14], the LogLikelihood ratio (Log-Like) [15] and F 2 [17]. Each metric is defined in Table 2. The expressiveness of the Dual C -means permits the definition of dif-ferent types of word similarity measures. As a consequence, we
It is clear that a great deal of association measures that could be tested exist. However, we selected the ones which best complement themselves. also compute word-word similarity based on the VSM representa-tion. In particular, for each snippet s i 2 S , a simple word-word sim-ilarity measure is S T S where S T is the transposed of the snippet-term matrix S . In this case, P = S T S . Another interesting simi-larity measure is LSA [20], which can be formulated as follows: P = U L e U T where U L U T is the eigen decomposition of S and e is the number of highest eigen values selected to represent the latent space 8 .

We aim to compare our algorithm to the most competitive strate-gies proposed so far in the SRC literature. For that purpose, we show the results of STC [40], LINGO [30], TOPICAL [35] and LDA [7]. It is worth noticing that for evaluation purposes, we de-veloped an open source implementation 9 of TOPICAL using the Wikipedia Miner API proposed by [24] and the spectral algorithm proposed by [29] included in SCIKit learning tool 10 . For LINGO and STC algorithms, we used the Carrot2 API 11 . And for LDA, we used the topic modeling package included in MALLET toolkit [23]. The parameters were set following the toolkit instructions (i.e. stop-words removal, a t = 0 : 01, b w = 0 : 01 and limited to 1000 iter-ations) and the cluster membership is assigned taken the maximum topic probability value.
 Different metrics have been proposed to evaluate text clustering. Within this paper, we present the results for the most relevant met-rics. The first complete study in terms of evaluation has certainly been proposed by [10]. In the specific case of SRC, the authors pro-pose the F C 1 metric, which is a specific implementation of the more general F b measure. Other metrics have also been proposed. For example, the F b 3 measure [2] addresses many important problems in clustering such as cluster homogeneity, completeness, rag-bag and size-vs-quantity constraints, and has shown interesting proper-ties for the SRC task as formulated in [26]. Two other important metrics have been studied in [13]: F N 1 and the Adjusted RandIn-dex (ARI) [37]. In particular, F N 1 can be seen as a complementary metric of F C 1 as it is also based on the classical F b measure but computed in a different manner 12 , while ARI evidences an inter-esting property for SRC. While it measures clustering accuracy, it also takes into account the fact that a given partition shows a sim-ilar partitioning shape compared with the reference gold standard. The underlying idea is that the number of clusters and the average number of Web snippets in each cluster approximate as much as possible the reference clustering. An illustration of this situation can be seen in [25] although the authors do not refer to this issue as an important one for SRC. In terms of implementation, we used the Java evaluator 13 to compute both F N 1 and ARI evaluation metrics, and the implementation provided by [3] 14 to compute F b 3 3, we defined all the metrics used for our experiments.
In our experiments, this value was set to the minimum which guar-antees that  X  e i = 1 L i 0 : 9  X  p 1 i = 1 L i .
This implementation is publicly available upon request. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ [Last access: 27/01/2014]. http://search.carrot2.org/stable/search [Last access: 27/01/2014].
Let us notice that these are two F 1 measures, which computation is defined differently in [10] and [13]. http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task11/index.php?id=data [Last access: 27/01/2014]. http://nlp.uned.es/  X enrique/software/RS.zip [Last access: 27/01/2014]. )+ l ogLike ( f ( w j ) f ( w i ; w j ) ; N f ( w i ) ; f ( w ) lo gLike ( f ( w j ) f ( w i ; w j ) ; N f ( w i ) ; f ( w Table 2: Collocation metrics used in our framework where P ( w ) is the joint probability of words w i and w j , P ( w i ; w j ) , f ( w i ) is the frequency of the word w i and N is the number of retrieved Web snippets.

All Web snippets were tokenized with the GATE platform 15 we did not apply stop-words removal so that we can propose a language-independent solution. In terms of dynamic reallocation algorithm, we used the optimized version of K -means++ proposed in [4] as the intialization process is semi-deterministic exists an efficient implementation called Scalable K-means++ [5].
A great deal of experiments have been performed to achieve con-clusive results. We first propose evaluating the clustering accuracy of the Dual C -Means against different state-of-the-art algorithms. For that purpose, we propose an exhaustive search as in [35], whose underlying idea is to evaluate the behavior of a given algorithm along with the increasing number of output partitions. In this first set of experiments, we pretend to understand the clustering quality of our approach when only text information is taken into account http://gate.ac.uk/ [Last access: 27/01/2014].
Note that for our experiments, the first seed Web snippet is se-lected as the one, which is most similar to all other ones in S . (i.e. V 1 = V 2 and the number of p words composing the centroids is set to 2) and compare it to state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, we present the results for 20 runs ( K = 2 :: 20) and illustrate the F values over ODP-239 and WEBSRC401 in Figure 3. Indeed, recent studies in [2][3] show that F b 3 is a superior metric to the classical F b measures to compute clustering accuracy.
 The obtained results show interesting situations. In all cases, Dual C -means outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of clustering accuracy. In particular, SCP, DICE and LogLike show improved results and outperform other word-word similarity met-rics. It is interesting to notice that PMI and F 2 , which are known to give less importance to more frequent events show less relevant results. As for the state-of-the-art algorithms, best results are ob-tained by STC improving over TOPICAL and LDA.
 These results only give a small idea of the overall phenomena. In Tables 4, 5 and 6, results for 10 cluster outputs are given for all metrics and all datasets. These new results show interesting properties of evaluation metrics. Although Dual C -means shows improvements over all competitors in terms of F b 3 or F C one case) for ODP-239, SEMEVAL and WEBSRC401, this situa-tion does not stand for the other metrics, ARI or F N 1 . For ODP-239, the best results are obtained by LDA in terms of ARI and LINGO in terms of F N 1 . For SEMEVAL, the best performances are provided by STC in terms of ARI and LINGO in terms of F N 1 . Deep analysis shows that ARI embodies an interesting property for the SRC task as it is well-known that the sizes of the clusters are not distributed equally on the Web. Indeed, ARI tends to favor solutions, which show similar partitioning shapes to the gold standard. As a con-sequence, a good SRC system should be performant both in terms of ARI and F b 3 . On the other hand, F N 1 shows inconsistent results when compared to all other metrics. In particular, it tends to give high results when the other metrics decrease.

Although different results are obtained for SEMEVAL and ODP-239, steady results are obtained for WEBSRC401 by the Dual C -Means configured with the S T S word-word similarity metric. In-deed, it clearly outperforms all other algorithms in terms of F F 1 and ARI. At this stage of our experiements, we can conclude that this configuration provides the best performance both in terms of clustering accuracy and partitioning shape.

The second set of our experiments aims to analyse the behav-ior of Dual C -Means when external resources are included. In this case, we use the set of query logs provided by the NTCIR-10 Intent-2 task [32] and propose to drive the clustering process by this ex-ternal information. As such, a cluster centroid is represented by its most representative query log. Results are presented in Table 6 where V 1 6 = V 2 for WEBSRC401. Let us notice that this is the only dataset for which experiments with query logs can be performed and easily reproduced.
 Table 5: Results of the Dual C -Means algorithm for ODP-239 and SEMEVAL. K fixed to 10 Clusters. Let us notice that for all experiments, the number of p words composing the centroids was set to 2 and the vocabulary is the set of words appearing in the retrieved Web snippets.

Note that  X  means paired student X  X  t-test statistical relevance for p value &lt; 0 : 05 between a given metric in V 1 = V 2 and its counterpart in V
Not surprinsingly , the introduction of external information de-creases clustering accuracy. But, this is true only for a glimpse when comparing S T S for V 1 = V 2 and SCP for V 1 6 = V 2 relevance is not true in this case). However, the difference in terms of ARI is higher in favor of the dual representation space, although not with statistical relevance. In this case, we can conclude that while clustering accuracy slightly drops, partitioning shape seems to be put in advance by the query log driven approach. The other benefit of this new dual approach may be embodied by the expres-siveness of the query logs as meaningful labels. This is the objec-tive of the next section.
As mentioned in [9], the labeling process plays an important role in the success of SRC systems. As a consequence, a clear objec-tive evaluation is needed. However, this has not yet been the case. Indeed, [18][16] proposed user studies, which are difficult to repli-cate. In order to solve reproducibility problems, [10][35] proposed to evaluate the k SSL metric but their datasets are defined in two different ways and they are not publicly available. So, in order to propose a conclusive evaluation of the labeling process, we pro-pose to use a new gold standard dataset provided by the Subtopic Mining subtask of the NTCIR-10 Intent-2 [32] and apply recent evaluation metrics proposed by [34]: I -rec @10, D -nDCG @10 and D #-nDCG @10.

These metrics aim to measure Precision and Recall of the users X  intents. Within our context, we can use the labels provided by the SRC algorithms as the users X  intents candidates. If so, we can di-rectly apply the given metrics. In particular, I -rec measures the number of intents discovered by the algorithm over the total dif-ferent intents of the query. This metric can simply be viewed as an intent Recall. Then, D -nDCG is obtained by sorting all relevant intents by the global gain, which is defined as the sum of all the individual intent gains. Finally, the D #-nDCG metric is the linear combination of I -rec and D -nDCG , using g and 1 g factors. Note that defining the probabilities of each intent as well as the relevant intents can be a hard task. However, as our experiments are re-alized over WEBSRC401 based on ClueWeb09, these values are known and publicly available [32]. In particular, the NTCIREVAL toolkit 17 was used for the calculation of these metrics. Let us no-tice that for the specific task of SRC, we propose to use I -rec @10, D -nDCG @10 and D #-nDCG @10 as for most queries the number of intents is limited. These metrics are defined in the Equations 7, 8 and 9.
 where I is the set of known intents for a query q and I 0 of intents covered by the returned labels at level N .
 where Pr ( i j q ) (resp. Pr ( i j q ) ) denotes the intent probability ob-tained for the discovered labels (resp. for the reference labels) and g ( r ) (resp. g i ( r ) ) is the gain value of the label at rank r with re-spect to i for the output of the labeling (resp. for the reference labeling). http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/tools/ntcirev al-en.html [Last access: 27/01/2014].
 where g was set to 0 : 5 following the framework evaluation pro-posed in the Subtopic Mining subtask of the NTCIR-10 Intent-2. The results provided by [33] for different query completions ( Bing Google C and Yahoo C ), query suggestions ( Bing S ) services and a simple merging strategy (Merge) are reported in Table 7 as well as the results of our approach. In particular, we show the results when clustering is query log driven ( V 1 6 = V 2 ) and when labeling is per-formed a posteriori ( V 1 = V 2 ). By a posteriori , we mean that clus-tering is first performed on the exclusive text representation. Then, as a usual second step, the label is computed by any heuristic. In our experiments, the query log that best represents each text-based cluster is computed using one iteration of the update function de-fined in section 3, which allows direct comparison results. Table 7: Evaluation results of the labeling process with query logs over the NTCIR-10 Intent-2 dataset. Note that  X  means paired student X  X  t-test statistical relevance for p value &lt; 0 : 05 between a given metric in V 1 = V 2 and its counterpart in V
The results of the query driven Dual C -Means outperform all baselines and a posteriori labeling. Moreover, all the differences between a given metric in V 1 = V 2 and its counterpart in V are statistically relevant. These results also show interesting be-haviors. Indeed, while PMI and F 2 collocation metrics previously showed worst clustering accuracy results compared to other con-figurations, they show improved results in terms of labeling. The fact that these metrics tend to favour less frequent associations is an interesting characteristic for labeling purposes and a conclusive remark. Moreover, the S T S word-word similarity measure shows high nDCG @10 value and competitive overall D # nDCG @10. These results clearly point at this last configuration as the best com-promise for clustering accuracy, labeling quality and partitioning shape.
In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm called Dual C -Means, which can be seen as an extension of the classical K -Means for dual representation spaces. Its originality relies in the fact that the clustering process can be driven by external resources by defin-ing two distinct representation spaces. In particular, we proposed that query logs are used as external information to guide clustering and afford meaningful labels to users in their search for informa-tion. We also built a new publicly available dataset called WEB-SRC401 based on ClueWeb09, which affords a more realistic sit-uation for Web SRC. A complete and reproducible evaluation was performed over different gold standard datasets (ODP-239 and SE-MEVAL) based on different publicly available evaluation tools. In particular, a great deal of evaluation metrics have been applied over diffferent configurations of the Dual C -Means integrating distinct word-word similarity measures. Results showed that our approach steadily outperforms all existing state-of-the-art SRC algorithms in terms of clustering accuracy ( F b 3 ) but is less competitive in terms of ARI. This situation is handled by the introduction of query logs, which allows high labeling quality with outperforming values of I rec @10, D nDCG @10 and D # nDCG @10 and adequate partitioning shape with high values of ARI.

The final findings that show that collocation metrics sensitive to high frequency events tend to produce high quality clusters and low frequency sensitive ones give rise to quality labels, is an interesting issue. Indeed, like the dual representation space, it suggests a mul-tiobjective implementation of the dynamic reallocation algorithm to the problem of SRC. Moreover, the next steps that are being carried out are the introduction of different resources to drive the clustering process, the definition of new P transition matices tak-ing into account recent developments in word-word similarity and the definition of powerful instantiation functions provided by the introduced general model.
