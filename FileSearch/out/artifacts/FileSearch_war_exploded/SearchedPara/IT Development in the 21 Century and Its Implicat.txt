 Ladies and Gentlemen! It is my great pleasure and honor to be here. I am Unna Huh, President of Informa-tion and Communications University (ICU), Korea. First of all, I would like to ex-press my sincere gratitude to the Pacific Asia conference on Knowledge Discovery &amp; Data Mining (PAKDD) for giving me this opportunity to share my views on the 21 st century X  X  IT development. I have been asked to speak about general IT development. In the next few minutes, I development in Korea and suggest some strategies for future IT development. 
In my opinion, the three keywords to describe the IT development in the 21 st cen-tury are digitalization, convergence, and ubiquitous revolution. This IT development has presented new opportunities for our society, corporations and individuals while posing a threat to us. In order to maximize the positive effects of IT development and to minimize its negative effects, I believe society must develop general coping strategies. operational styles of organizations, society X  X  infrastructure and culture, and individu-als X  life styles. There are several rules of thumb that we have gathered from the past IT development and that would help us predict the future trends of IT development in terms of quantity, and these are as follows: 
Let me review now the three key elements of the IT development in the 21 st century. 2.1 Digitalization First of all, I expect that there will be rapid digitalization of IT equipment. We will soon see digital TVs, digital camera/phone/DVDs, and digital household electronic appliances. There will also be digitalization of IT networks, such as digital broadcast-ing stations, digital cable TVs, digital mobile communication (2.5G/3G), IP-connected wired telephone network, and digital satellites. Furthermore, the digitaliza-tion of information or contents will be accelerated; thus, there will be widespread use of MP3 music files, digital photos and animation, and e-books. 2.2 Convergence Secondly, we have come to witness the phenomenon of convergence as the computer and communication are converged. Especial ly thanks to the far-reaching digitaliza-tion, there will be active device convergence, and it will be difficult to determine the which mobile phones and PDA are integrated and Internet TVs, a combination of the Internet and TVs. Moreover, the differen t infrastructures of various communication networks that have existed separately will become broadband, converged, and com-posite as in the cases of the convergence of communication and broadcasting and the them via mobile phones. Presently beyond the boundary of the existing IT industries, IT and banking are being converged, and we also see super convergence taking place between IT, NT, and BT. 2.3 Ubiquitous Revolution In the core of the 21 st century X  X  information and communication technologies lie ubiq-uitous services combining the strengths of the Internet and wireless and wired IT. In we can be connected to anyone anywhere any time. This will be made possible by the combination of wired and wireless communication technologies and computing technological, industrial elements in the next-generation ubiquitous environment and is expected to create new markets in various areas. I have so far described the three major phenomena of IT development in the 21 st cen-tury. This is an overview of both the constructive aspects and the threats and dangers ment has brought to us. 3.1 The Impact of Digitalization First, digitalization will dramatically increase the efficiency and performance of IT equipment and network. As the content compatibility and the extent of inter-operation among different types of equipment improve, we are likely to enjoy more the benefits of having networks. We will get exposed to more and better-quality in-formation that is generated and disseminated, and it will be much easier for the users i.e., distance e-health services made available by information and communication technologies, and thus enjoy better-quality life. and how to measure the outcome of future investment as we expect a considerable amount of investment in digital upgrade. Some of the traditional businesses, such as conventional photo studios, video rentals, film manufacturers, and analog watch ven-number of the video rentals in Korea in 1996, which exceeded 32,000, considerably decreased to 8000 rentals by February 2003. In addition, there will be a problem of digital divide between those who have access to and make use of digital technologies asset, we will be faced with frequent problems of hacking and plagiarism, made easier by the characteristics of digital technologies. 3.2 The Impact of Convergence Secondly, it is possible to create a new servi ce or product using digital technologies as manufacturing industries are given new opportunities to overcome the existing boundaries and to explore a new aspect of growth: Telematics is an integration of auto and IT technologies; cyber apartments are an outcome of combining construction and Internet technologies; the home appliance industry is leading home networking. 
However, some of the traditional companies have had to deal with competition that they can X  X  possibly win because of the collapse of the boundaries among the indus-tries. Credit companies, for example, have suffered a serious blow because of the advent of a payment system via portable phones. The value chain of the existing industries has been destroyed, and multip le value chains are being converged and combined into a new value network, which has put traditional companies in a difficult position to compete against new breeds of businesses. We have seen the severe com-petition to occupy the wireless portal market between mobile companies and tradi-tional Internet portals. 3.3 The Impact of Ubiquitous Revolution Finally, with the advent of ubiquitous services that overcome spatial, time constraints, the efficiency of companies and society in general will greatly improve. In a ubiqui-tous environment, there will be a large number of devices and sensors surrounding the manner. Ubiquitous computing also establishes USN (ubiquitous sensor network), where invisible computers automatically detect time-varying contexts and makes it possible to execute information sharing, behavior proposals, and action measures necessary for human life. In sum, ubiquitous services will contribute to the improve-ment of the quality of individuals X  everyday lives. 
Unfortunately, omnipresent computing technologies have also had negative effects, such as the broadening of information gap and digital waste created by the digitaliza-tion and networking of equipment. The right of being unconnected is not guaranteed, which may give rise to serious violations of individual privacy. Furthermore, IT de-velopment may aggravate people X  X  feelings of isolation, the phenomenon called digi-tal isolation. Ubiquitous computing is defined as  X  X onnected to any device anytime kinds of problems in information protection will arise; the seriousness of the existing issues will be amplified. RFID in specific has innate problems of information leak-age, distortion, and supervision. If we do not take proper measures to deal with these problems, they will act as stumbling blocks in the expansion of RFID and in our entry into ubiquitous society. To this point I have discussed the general IT development, and the rest of my talk will concentrate on the IT development in Korea and its related issues. 4.1 Major Achievements The most noteworthy IT achievement that Korea has made in recent years is the fact that Korea has achieved the commercialization and localization of major digital tech-nologies, such as CDMA, DRAM, and TDX, for the first time in the world. 
Furthermore, mobile communication terminals have grown to be a strategically and become high-quality, high-end products in the world X  X  market. 
In addition, the number of domestic users of mobile communication services has The number is close to 73% of the overall distribution rate, and more than the half of them are wireless Internet subscribers. One out of every two Korean citizens (59%) is using the Internet, and 73% of the households are subscribers of VHS Internet. Korea has taken the fifth place in Internet use and risen as the world X  X  digital power. 
Also, Korea boasts of the world X  X  best information infrastructure: the Korean gov-ernment has created a world-class service infrastructure to be an electronic government and established a VHS information communi cation network connecting 144 major cities across the nation in 2000. This was the world X  X  first achievement of its kind. 4.2 Some Issues of Note While Korea has had some remarkable achievements in IT, there are also some limita-tions that should be overcome for further speed y advance. Most of all, there is a lack of core technologies to carry out digital convergence. In the case of semi-conductor technology, which is considered a core technology, the domestic semi-conductor industry focuses on manufacturing of memory chips but heavily depends on the im-ports of ASIC (SOC) while the proportion of non-memory and memory chips in the world market is 80 vs. 20. 
Insufficient manpower and technological prowess in the area of software, the axis ware industry, we are in urgent need of mo re software experts, especially high-quality manpower ready with both knowledge of software engineering technologies and pro-ject management skills. In the next four years, the domestic software industry will suffer from a shortage of human resources, up to 6 000 people. 
Finally, although digital contents are at the heart of IT industry as digitalization, con-vergence, and ubiquitous revolution are in progress, Korea does not hold strong com-petitive power over emotional contents, where culture, technology and economy meet. 4.3 Suggestions for Solutions and Coping Strategies posite disciplines in higher education and to train manpower of complex knowledge convergence are not passing fads. Society needs experts who can draw the overall picture for the general public. That is to say what leads to the success of information and communication technologies, including digitalization and convergence, is not the technology itself but the humans. We need no other choice but to make a bold in-vestment in IT education. Korea in large part has maintained the traditional education system, and only a few institutions produce human resources equipped with knowl-edge of composite technologies. We will need to encourage multifaceted learning and produce manpower of complex knowledge beyond the boundary of the existing tradi-tional education system. The case of Information and Communications University (ICU), where disciplinary education in the true sense is provided between the disci-plines of IT engineering and IT management, is worth notice. ICU is Korea X  X  most prominent IT institution and strives to become world X  X  foremost research-centered university in the field of IT. Its mission is to educate world X  X  future IT leaders. recommended that Korea learn to train/produce rule makers, e.g., J. K. Rowling, au-thor of Harry Potter series, and Steven Spielberg, that is, composite talents who can lead materialize them into digital contents, and service and utilize them via digital media. makes a large amount of investment in a technology without an appropriate viewpoint of marketing, it may help facilitate the widespread use of the technology, but it is not certain whether or not such development is useful or will eventually improve the quality of life. Therefore, it is important for the industry to find out what the consum-ers ultimately want from digitalization and convergence. zation, convergence, and ubiquitous revolutio n. There is no guarantee that the digi-talization or convergence of particular items will lead to success in the market. Sev-eral years ago, a digital camera equipped with a MP3 player was on the market, but it turned out a disastrous failure. It is not necessary to do convergence on all the items. Some may need convergence and others, divergence. This requires a balanced ap-proach on the basis of an appropriate strategy. advances in digital technologies, convergence, and ubiquitous computing. IT revolu-tion may dramatically improve the quality of human life and allow amazing degree of comfort in our lives, but like a double-edged sword, IT may also be misused and have disastrous impacts on our daily lives, such as invasion of privacy, leakage and abuse of personal information, and hacking. In dealing with these problems, technological advances alone may not be sufficient. There is a need for innovative education re-gionally and worldwide to cultivate wisdom in U-citizens so that they can use the modern convenience of IT with strong ethics. We also need to establish new laws and societal systems appropriate for the ubiqu itous era. As we are heading for a U-society, where one can be connected to any one any time and any where, the task for tions, and continents to facilitate the constructive, beneficial aspect of IT advances and
