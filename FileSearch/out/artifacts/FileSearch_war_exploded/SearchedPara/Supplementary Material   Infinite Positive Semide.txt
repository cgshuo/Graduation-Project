 1.1. Matrix Inequality for Concave Function For a positie semidefinite (PSD) matrix V ,wecansay respect to  X  to be zero, we have Substituting  X  = V back in the right-hand side of inequality ( 1 ), we have Since this is the minimum of the right-hand side, we have inequality ( 1 ) for arbitrary  X  . 1.2. Matrix Inequality for Convex Function For a PSD matrix Z and a set of PSD matrices { V k } K k =1 such that K k =1 V k is invertible, we can say right-hand side of inequality ( 4 )asfollows: partial derivative with respect to  X  k to be zero, we have Summing both sides, we have K k =1  X  k = K k =1 V k A k = I , from which we have the optimal Lagrangian ( 4 ), we have identity matrix. 1982 ) as the functional form of q ( V k ). The MGIG distribution over PSD matrix X is defined as by using a Monte Carlo method. More specifically, E [ X ] is given by the following integral: as U  X  X  (2  X , R  X  1 ), we can say Similarly, E [ X  X  1 ]isgivenby simulation ( Butler &amp; Wood , 2003 ). is directly attached to the source spectrograms, the resulting signals have some unpleasant artifacts. Wiener filtering (Eq. (15) of the paper) that assumes source signals to follow full-covariance Gaussians. We tested LD-PSDTF on an audio signal synthesized by concatenating seven piano sounds (C, E, G, C+E, C+G, E+G, and C+E+G) with a MIDI synthesizer. The total length was 8.4 s (1.2 s * 7). The task was to separate by using the multiplicative update (MU) algorithm with K = 3. For comparison, we tested KL-NMF with K =3 for amplitude-spectrogram decomposition and IS-NMF with K = 3 for power-spectrogram decomposition. The experimental results showed overwhelming superiority of LD-PSDTF for source separation. The average SDR, SIR, and SAR were 16.7dB, 21.1dB, and 18.7dB for KL-NMF, 18.9dB, 24.1dB, and 20.5dB for IS-NMF, and 26.7dB, 33.2dB, and 27.8dB for LD-PSDTF. We found it practically effective to initialize LD-PSDTF by the local optima. This means that LD-PSDTF can be used as a high-quality sound generator for IS-NMF.
