 1. Introduction
Kale and Yerneni (2000) proposed a model for the distribution of impact factors, based on a gamma dis-tribution. They assumed that the distribution of impact factor is bounded by a finite positive number b , the maximum possible value of impact factor in a given discipline. They treated b as unknown parameter and esti-mated it by the maximum impact factor observed in the data. Thus, their model is given by
F ( x ) and by considering the initial probabilities of the event of a paper being published in SCI and non-SCI journals, they proposed a model for the distribution of impact factor. It is given by Where P ( x &gt;0)= a represents the probability that a paper is published in a SCI journal and
P ( x =0)=1 a . Their model therefore consists of three parameters. Kale and Yerneni (2000) assumed in their study that the papers published in non-SCI journals have zero impact factors, although it is possible that such papers may influence future research. Their study was based on Arunachalam (1999) work on a statistical ana-tutions located over 450 cities/towns in India. Arunachalam (1999) in his work observed that about 46% of the articles were published in non-SCI journals and further 37% in journals with impact factors less than one. 2. Objectives of the study
The objectives of the study are to identify a (a) suitable theoretical distribution to explain/describe an empirical distribution of impact factor and also (b) model to predict the number of low impact factor journals or the core journals in a database in a subject.
In this paper, as Kale and Yerneni (2000) did, zero impact factors have been assigned for all those non-SCI journals. We have attempted to fit a well-known two-parameter gamma distribution as discussed by Johnson,
Kotz, and Balakrishnan (1994) with a as mean and b as 1. The results are excellent as shown in Table 3 and in Fig. 1 . As discussed in Johnson et al. (1994) , when b = 1, Eq. (2) becomes a single parameter gamma distribution.
We have also attempted to fit a general exponential model as given by where 1/ h is the mean of the distribution.
The gamma is a flexible life distribution model and it offers a good fit for  X  X  X ailure data X  X . It is conjectured here that the gamma distribution likely to fit distribution of impact factors. Further due to its moderately skewed profile, the gamma distribution is perhaps adequate enough to explain distribution of impact factors.
We have also attempted to fit exponential, lognormal and Kale X  X erneni model for our data. 3. Data analysis
Data in the area of  X  X  X oftware and related topics X  X  were collected from the COMPENDEX and INSPEC databases for the years 1989 X 2001. The data from two databases are merged into one database depending on the year of publications, using ISO export and import option in the WINISIS. Programs were then written to extract the  X  X  X ame of the journals X  X  from each of the records in the new database. A journal was considered only once, irrespective of number of articles (in the journals), which were covered in the database; i.e., a jour-nal, which might have published 100 articles, was considered only once as shown in Table 2 . For example, 1057 titles published 17,026 articles in 1992. It is possible that some of the titles (in 1992 databases) might have published prior to 1992. However, we assigned the impact factor to the 1057 journals based on 1992 impact factors. The Table 1 shows the year wise distribution of the number of articles and journals.
Table 2 gives the distribution of impact factors for the grouped data for 10 years. In this study, we have observed: (a) 70 to 80% of the journals have less than 0.5 impact factors. (b) The percentage of number of low impact factor journals is decreasing over a period of time, particularly
Above, (a) indicates that, such a highly skewed data, gamma distribution is more suitable than any other dis-tribution, particularly when x is continuous in nature ( X  x is not integer) and (b) indicates that there is a trend of publishing in  X  X  X ournals having higher impact factors X  X , in recent times.

As mentioned in the section 2 , we attempted to fit exponential distribution as given in Eq. (4) , gamma dis-proposed by Kale and Yerneni. The results were very poor for lognormal and for Kale and Yernini model.
The results for the exponential and the gamma distribution were good and therefore only these two results are given in Table 3 . Since we assigned the value of 1 for b , in a sense, we fitted one parameter gamma dis-tribution. Strictly speaking this is a two-parameter distribution. As the K X  X  test assumes that no parameter has been estimated (although, it is a non-parametric test, we have to estimate the parameters in order to fit a theoretical distribution and we estimated only a ), we have applied K X  X  test. The results of the tests are given in Table 3 .

In Table 3 , D 0.05 refers to the critical values for a = 0.05.  X  X  X amma X  X  and  X  X  X xp X  X  in Table 3 refer to the D values (the differences between observed and estimated values of F ( x )) for Gamma and exponential distribu-tion, respectively. Table 3 indicates that Gamma distributions fit much better than the exponential distribu-tions for all the ten years; however, in order to fit the gamma distribution, the mean of the discrete data (for instance, 1057 observations for 1992), instead of the mean of grouped data was considered, since it gave a curves over lap very well! Y -axis refers to relative cumulative frequencies for (both observed and theoretical) and X -axis refers to impact factors. We have used grouped data for the purpose of fitting the theoretical distribution.

Kale and Yerneni (2000) in their article argued that the fitted distribution as given in Eq. (1) adequately describes the distribution of the impact factors. However, their value of D value of 0.0341 (Computed under the assumption that n = 2582, the number of journals.) It certainly indicates that for their data the gamma distribution as discussed by Kale and Yerneni (2000) is only a close approximation.

An Attempt was also made to test whether or not a null hypothesis (H nals covered, higher the number of  X  X  X ow impact factor journals X  X  (those journals having less than 0.5 impact factors) X  X  is true. The results are shown in Table 4 .

Table 4 clearly indicates that there exists a linear relation (with positive slope) between the number of jour-nals ( X ) and number of low impact factor journals ( Y ). The equation of the fitted model is y = 85.6473 + 0.7337 * x . Since the p -value (for the slope) in the ANOVA table is less than 0.01, there is a statistically significant relationship between x and y at the 99% confidence level. The R -Squared statistic indi-indicates a relatively strong relationship between the variables. Thus, this relation suggests (for our data) that the higher the number of journals covered the higher the number of low impact factor journals. However as mentioned earlier, the percentage of low impact factor journals are considerably decreasing, over a period of
For all practical purposes, we can therefore assume y = bx . The F-test also suggests that two parameters ( a and b ) in the regression equation ( y = a + bx ) are significantly different from zero. i.e., at least one of them is not equal to zero. This linear model is thus sensible and may be used to predict the number of low impact factor journals in a database. 4. Conclusion
For ten years of data on impact factors of journals related to software literature were analyzed. It has been observed that a gamma distribution ( a as mean and b as 1) fits the empirical distribution very well. However, one has to improve upon the study further to derive a quality index.

The following conclusions have been drawn is this study: (a) Gamma distribution (with a as its mean and b as 1) fits the observed data much better than the well-(b) Lognormal distribution shows a poor fit (results are not shown in the paper). (c) The gamma distribution as compared to Kale and Yernini model is certainly simpler to fit. (d) There exists a linear relation (with positive slopes) between the number of journals covered and number (e) The researchers are now publishing their articles in high impact factor journals in the field of software
In gamma distribution, a is the mean of the distribution and thus to a great extent, we can treat it as an  X  X  X ndex X  X , to identify a set of quality journals. That is the higher the mean, more the number of quality journals. For instance, the lowest value of the mean (0.219) in this study was observed for the year 1996; and in that year, 81.3% of the articles were published in the low impact factor ( 6 0.5) journals. On the other hand in 2001, the mean was 0.474 and only 70% of the journals have the impact factor less than 0.5. Thus mean of the dis-tribution can be treated as a key to decide a set of quality journals.
