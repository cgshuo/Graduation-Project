 With the upcoming era of Web2.0, the resource integration and personalization technologies on Portal platform are beco ming well-developed. Portal offers many more various. Consequently, discovering and extracting the personalization interests from Portal are the essential tasks performed with understanding the preferences and log histories to find the interest features and relevant degrees, reducing the noise due representation and well modeling, especially to user privacy protection. Various implicit schemes have been proposed in the related literature, e.g., based on intelligent behaviors extraction cannot address the issues of personalization interests mining in Portal. 
Furthermore, the existing web usage mining (WUM) techniques [1-4,6] lack the characteristics, adjust the structure reasse mbling and carry out the advertisements. As service quality by mining interest navigation patterns adaptively. Shi [7] presents a novel method to deal with interest navigation problems based on the hidden Markov model in order to discover users X  interest navigation patterns, which seems some algorithm. This approach is mainly processing uniform interest results of all users but complement in Portal interest mining. 
In this paper, we explore the mapping of the personalization interest behaviors on Portal. Then we briefly present a novel Portal-independent mechanism of interest elicitation supporting privacy protection, with solutions to implement implicit extraction of diverse access behaviors and corresponding semantic analysis. Emphasizing the association effect of interest weights and the prediction on interest intentions, we extend the hidden Markov model with personalization interest description of Portal forming interest navigation patterns for different users. 2.1 Basic Definitions In this section, some definitions and assumptions are given as follows: Definition 1. Each interest content on Portal points the classified concept object which the user interests in or accesses on the personalization desktop. Let (abbr. IC ). Given () U c interest content clustering results, while it can be expressed by {}  X  denotes the feature of corresponding cluster. Definition 2. Each interest behavior on Portal indicates certain potential typical visiting operation on IC . Let IB={SetMode, SetRecomTime, Switch, Maximize, Minimize, Close, Click, Layout, Add, Delete, Edit, Quote, Comment} be the finite Interest Behavior Set (abbr. IB ). These interest behaviors may be classified into four categories shown in Table 1. behaviors on different interest contents occur during every session T , each at is user X  X  at s can be gathered into the Access Transaction Set (abbr. AT u ) with temporal order as {} forming AT u . 2.2 Analysis of Ma pping Interest Behaviors We put forward the detailed analysis of the operation semantic features of interest behaviors in Table 1. The listed mapping relationship offers a novel reference for by more details might be avoided considerably. 
To represent these interest behaviors on Portal more practically, we introduce fuzzy logic [9,10] to incorporate the context of feature factors in Table 1. on domain () IB IC AT AT u , can be given by: With the entire accessing duration () and global interests respectively. Where r x  X  [1,5] is the interest degree of each accessing interest behavior ranked as Table 1. Definition 5. Let {} sequence at S (i.e., Portlets) on personalization desktop, where each at.sequence records every fuzzy relation set of layout sequence on domain () IB IC S Where P k i denotes the relative forward or backward transition offset in S u . 
Consequently, the particular interest weight of each user combining the effect of personalization interest behaviors on Portal can be denoted as follows: We observe that custom configuration and layout behaviors could hardly be logged by Portal server essentially, even no more entries within the captured records about browse-click and edit-comment yet. Based on the preceding statement, a novel Portal-independent mechanism of interest elicitation is proposed, which implements both the implicit extraction of diverse access behaviors and their semantic analysis. 
The following strategy is taken in the approaches according to the mentioned four categories of interest behaviors: (i) Custom configuration : We use open API of Portal predefined parameter pairs (i.e., constructed in Attribute-Value format) in the UP, which have represented the semantic information and without additional semantic analysis. To cope with the general-purpose goal, we develop a new adapter used to (ii) Browse-click : We discuss based on the different possible operation objects. For the Portlets integrated with WSRP, to analyze the interaction requests at WSRP producer. For the normal web application requ ests, to capture the key requests using traditional means in WUM. And for the particular Portal applications, to call the events. Here, the captured results may be preprocessed into AT u . (iii) Layout : We use the similar method with (i) to capture user X  X  layout behaviors. Note that the captured results are the appropriate layout structur es of different personalization desktops, which may contribute to form the S u . (iv) Edit-comment : The method is similar as that mentioned in (ii). 
We summarize the feature relationship of interest behavior semantics in Table 1 and build a mapping list in XML format. There involves two steps: Filtering the redundancy requests, and matching the valid parameter features with the Attribute-Value. The elicitation entry is defined as &lt;user,timestamp,object,behavior,desktop&gt; . 
During the implicit interest elicitation process, there requires supplementing legal between personalization and privacy. Based on the idea in transportation safety administration [11] , we adopt recently released National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) to establish the accountable representation logic. We use the Notation 3 [12] to convert the transactional data into serializing RDF, which contains the representation request parameters, which supports the validity determination and centralized storage of private data in privacy protection. By such means, we can provide the legal transparent accountable interests in terms of the interest behavior entries implied with the rule. interest trends, and especially benefit the recommendation schema improvement in order of precedence whenever the prediction or resources presentation is proceeding. We attempt to seek the obtained AT u s to represent the navigation patterns on particular interest contents. Therefore, the presented hidden Markov model extension differs from [7] mainly in two aspects. First, the mapping of personalization interests on Portal is complemented. Second, th e formula process is according to every particular user X  X  personalization descrip tion instead of the entire user group. The HMM extension with the personalization interest of Portal is proposed as follows: (i) Let the interest content node on personal desktop denote as the state node  X  in HMM. Given the virtual initial state q 1 , there is the relative interest concept distribution ( ) accessed in at i , denote Denote and the total number of posterior accessed nodes on all concepts: (iii) The HMM with personalization interest description of Portal is to represent a state sequence with the maximal observing probability on certain personalization interest content k We consider not only the effect of different personalization interest behaviors on Portal, but also the prediction on interest intention in order to achieve the objectivity easily from the discovered navigation relationship. With the increasing of the user discovery [7] to ensure the accuracy and availability. We built a certain prototype Portal with BEA Weblogic Platform 8.1 in which the experiments might be performed completely. The dataset consists of 50 random users, sessions obtained by our elicitation approach successfully. 5.1 Interest Elicitation Results and Analysis The first experiment focuses on observing the effectiveness and evaluating the performance of implicit interest elicitation mechanism. After constructing the AT u s (3). Under this scenario, we observe the distribution of () number of sessions in AT u and the user as a kind of measure method. Fig.1(a) shows one random user X  X  interest distributions as the range of AT u increases. It is clear that Subsequently, we hold | AT u |=50 and observe the interest distributions varying with personalization interest of each user expected as our previous discussion. 
In this experiment, we also analyze the performance effect to the Portal server of our mechanism. We compare the cost (i.e., measured by time (ms)) on loading the Portal desktop into client browser whether the interest elicitation does in Fig.5. Although there is a little improvement measured within 12ms, our schema works with desired performance. 5.2 Mining Navigation Patterns Results and Analysis The second experiment consists in discovering the interest navigation patterns of different users, which can be performed with two basic steps: categorizing the interest concept and calculating the observing probability. We still mine the representative entries in AT u ( |AT u |=100) in Fig.1(a), setting three ro ugh interest concept sets named Under this scenario, the relative transfer probability ( ) observing probability ( ) fulfill our extended HMM. Fig.4(a-c) plot the user X  X  entire possible interest navigation states on different interest concept sets m easured by order. Hence, we could discover the interest navigation patterns with the maximal observing probability. 
The results show that the HMM extension with personalization interest description of Portal has met the proposed interest elicitation mechanism sufficiently. Higher representation accuracy can be achieved, while helping us better to predict and understand the personalization interest navigation patterns and intentions of each user. Mining personalization interest and navigation patterns on Portal is significant for the personalization interest behaviors on Portal and propose a novel Portal-independent mechanism of interest elicitation with privacy protection. Furthermore, we present an HMM extension with personalization interest description of Portal to discover the interest navigation patterns. The improvement on representation accuracy and mining distinguishes our approaches from traditional ones. Since no attempt has previously consideration, we attempt to conduct such a study to proceed as a design guideline in future research.
