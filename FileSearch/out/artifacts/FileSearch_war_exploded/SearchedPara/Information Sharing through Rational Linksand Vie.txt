 In this paper we present the concept of Federated Informa-tion Sharing Communities (FISC), which leverages organi-sational and social relationships with document content to provide community-centred information sharing and com-munication environments. Prominence is given to capabil-ities that go beyond the generic retrieval of documents to include the ability to retrieve people, their interests and inter-relationships. We focus on providing social awareness  X  X n the large X  to help users understand the members within community and the relationships between them. Within the FISC framework, we provide viewpoint retrieval to enable a user to construct member-specific view(s) of the community, based on their various topic interests. As proof of concept, we present the first FISC prototype based on the twenty-five year SIGIR collection and examples of operational results.

We characterize current approaches to supporting communities as communication-centred, document-centred or community-centred. Community-centred approaches focus on building an understanding of community relationships through social awareness[1], which is the main thrust of our work. We formulated the following hypotheses concerning the FISC concept: Bearing these questions in mind, we designed the three-layer FISC architecture[2], and implemented the first prototype based on the collection of papers from twenty-five year of SIGIR conferences. The twenty-five year SIGIR collection contains the title, au-thor names, abstracts and year of publication of all 853 pa-pers published at the SIGIR conferences from the last 25 years[3]. We use it to model (partially) the IR community, and build the corpus using title and abstract from each pa-per.
 As shown in Figure 1a, we generate the overall topic model of the whole corpus by creating a non-overlapping clustering of the collection. Each cluster is considered as a sub-topic of the community.
 A member (author) interest model is identified as subset of a particular sub-topic (cluster), and represented as the col-lection of that member X  X  associated papers within the sub-topic. This process is iterated over all the sub-topics and members of the community (all authors).
 For a given community member, we look at one of his in-terest models at a time, linking it with all the others and identify the rational links. The results are presented as ratio-nal linked community members with relevant interest models (Figure 1b), which are further grouped according to their or-ganisational and/or social structures (co-authorship in this case), see Figure 2.
 Here we present an example of the prototype, where a user wants to focus on a particular author. We choose Croft, who is an expert as well as an active author in the IR com-munity. FISC displays all his interest models, such as lan-guage modelling, cross-language IR, inference network etc. Suppose the user is interested in Croft X  X  work on relevance feedback (RF), and trying to find out what the community looks like from Croft X  X  viewpoint of the topic.
 Traditionally, we get list of documents from retrieval sys-tems such as Google. Digital Libraries such as ACM and CiteSeer do a better job by providing information like simi-larity matching and co-authorship analysis at a per-document basis. In contrast, FISC focuses on content-based linking at
