 With the advent of digital devices like digital cameras, camera-enabled mobile phones, the number of images on the World Wide Web is growing rapidly. This led to an active research in the organization, indexing and retrieval of images on the World Wide Web. Providing search services for the web images has been difficult. Traditional image retrieval systems assign annotations to each image manually. Although it is a good methodology to retrieve images through text retrieval technologies, it is gradually becoming impossible to annotate images manually one by one due to the huge and rapid growing number of web images. Automatic Image Annotation has become an active research area since then. A common view is that semantics of web images are well correlated with their associated texts. Because of this, many popular search engines offer web image search based only on the associated texts.

ALT text is considered the most important of all associated texts. ALT at-tribute is used to describe the contents of an image file. It X  X  important for several reasons: ALT attribute is designed to be an alternative text description for im-ages. It represents the semantics of an image as it provides useful information to anyone using the browsers that cannot display images or image display disabled. It can help search engines to determine t he best image to return for a user X  X  query.
Many popular internet search engines like Google Image Search 1 make use of these associated texts while indexing the images and give higher importance to the terms present in ALT text. Google sta tes the importance of ALT text in their official blog 2 :  X  X s the Googlebot does not see the images directly, we generally concentrate on the information provided in the  X  X LT X  attribute. X 
The ALT attribute has been used in numerous research studies of Web image retrieval. It is given the highest weight in [1]. In [2], the authors consider query terms that occur in ALT text and image names to be  X  X ery relevant X  in ranking images in retrieval. Providing  X  X  text equivalent for every non-text element X  (for example, by means of the ALT attribute) is a checkpoint in the W3C X  X  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 3 . The authors of [3] also state the importance of using ALT text. However, a recent st udy [4] has shown that around half of the images on the web have no ALT text at all. The author collected 1579 images from Yahoo! X  X  random page service and 3888 images from the Google directory. 47.7% and 49.4% of images respectively had ALT text, of which 26.3% and 27.5% were null. It is clear from this study that most of the web images don X  X  contain ALT text.

Therefore, predicting ALT text of an image in a web page would be of great use in web image retrieval. In this paper, we address the problem of predicting terms in ALT text by proposing a term weighti ng approach using term co-occurrences. We treat the prediction of terms in ALT text as the problem of automatic image annotation based on the image associated texts. This approach can be extended to any image dataset with associated texts.

The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our approach to term weighting using term co-occurrences. We describe the dataset, evaluate our system and prove the usefulness of it in Section 3. Section 4 gives an overview of related work. We conclude that our proposed approach can be useful in web image retrieval and give an account of our future directions in Section 5. In this section, we propose a term 4 weighting model to compute the term weights based on the term co-occurrences in image associated texts to predict the terms in ALT text. Terms in the texts are considered to be similar if they appear in simi-lar contexts. Therefore, these similar w ords do not have to be synonyms or belong to the same lexical category. Before calc ulating term weights , associated texts need to be preprocessed. The first step i s to remove common words(stopwords) using a list of stop words. The second st ep is to use stemming to normalize the representations of terms. In our work, we used Porter Stemmer [5] for stemming.
According to the distributional hypothesis [6], semantically similar terms oc-cur in same or similar contexts. We use this information in our term weighting model. A term is said to be important if it occurs in many associated texts and co-occurs with many other terms pres ent in different associated texts.
For each image, we calculate term weights using the following equation. s ( t, t i ), the similarity between two terms t and t i , is calculated using Jaccard Similarity as follows: S  X  S contain the term t . N is the total number of unique terms in all associated texts. Imp ( t ) is the importance of a term which is calculated as follows: boost ( a i ) is the boost of the associated text a i which contains the term t and A is the set of associated texts which contain the term t . Based on the heuristic of importance(image caption, HTML title, image filename, anchor text, source page url, surrounding text in that order), we assign a boost to the extracted associated texts. Value of boost for each associated text is given based on the importance of the associated text as stated above. Once the weight for each term has been computed, the terms are ranked in descending order based on term weights and top k terms are selected as terms in ALT text. In this section, we present the evaluation procedure of our approach. We briefly describe the data collection and preprocessing steps, present the evaluation pro-cedure and finally results are discussed. 3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing A crawler is used to collect images from many websites. Images like banners, icons, navigation buttons etc, which are not so useful are not considered. The web documents are preprocessed to extra ct associated texts so that the images can be indexed and retrieved with these text features. The associated texts we considered are extracted from HTML page title, image filename, source page url, anchor text, image caption and surrounding text.
We used Guardian 5 , Telegraph 6 and Reuters 7 as the source urls and col-lected a total of 100000 images: 11000 images from Reuters, 41000 images from Guardian and 48000 images from Telegraph which have ALT text. We selected these news websites because the ALT text provided in them is accurate and is very useful for evaluation. The pages in which the images are present, cover a wide range of topics including technology, sports, national and international news, etc. Stopwords are removed and stemming is used to filter the duplicate words from the extracted textual information. 3.2 Baseline Approaches Most of the keyword extraction techniques use frequency based approaches like TF.IDF [7] or, simply term frequency. We implemented two approaches based on term frequency(TF) and document freque ncy(DF) respectively as the baseline approaches. TF is the number of occurren ces of a term in all associated texts, where as DF is the number of associated texts in which the term appears. In general, if the term appears in many associated texts, it will have higher weight than the ones which appear in less number of associated texts. We compute TF and DF of each term present in associated texts of an image. Once tf and df for each term has been computed, the terms are ranked in descending order based on term weights and top k terms are selected as terms in ALT text.

IDF is used to enhance the significance of the terms in a given corpus which appear in less number of documents. In our approach, terms are used to derive the semantics of the embedded images in a single document. IDF is not used as a baseline approach in our analysis for the above reason. 3.3 Evaluation Procedure In order to evaluate the effectiveness o f our method, we compare the predicted terms produced by our approach against the terms extracted from ALT attribute of an image in the corresponding web page. In addition we also compare the performance of our method against the baseline approaches which are based on term frequency and document frequency respectively.

We present results using the top 5, 10, and 15 words. We adopt the recall, precision and F-measures to evaluate the performance in our experiments. If P t is the set of terms predicted by our approach and A t is the set of terms in ALT text, then in our task, we calculate preci sion, recall and F-measure as follows: 3.4 Analysis As we can see from the results shown in Fig.1, Fig.2 and Fig.3, our approach gives good results at top 15 terms. From our experiments we found that it X  X  just the order of importance of associated texts, not the values of boost of associated texts, that influences the performance of our approach. The predicted terms that are not present in the original ALT text may not completely be irrelevant. There could be cases where the pr edicted terms may represent the image, but they are not used in ALT text. Author of a web page may use some terms that comes to his mind when writing ALT text for an image and uses semantically related terms across other associated texts. In that case, the term that the author uses consistently across associated texts of an image will be predicted to be in original ALT text. For example, Consider an image of a cricketer. If the author of a web page uses the term  X  X atsman X  in the ALT text and uses the term  X  X ricketer X , which is semantically related to  X  X atsman X  across other associated texts, the term  X  X ricketer X  might be predicted by our approach. Manual evaluation has been done on 1000 images taking semantic relationship into account and found that the values of precision, recall and F -measure have been increased by 3.61%, 5.73% and 4.50% respectively. The results are given in Table 1.
 Many web image search engines use keyword based search to retrieve images. Automatic Image Annotation is the key issue in keyword based image retrieval.
There has been plenty of work done in Automatic Image Annotation. Some of the early approaches [8, 9] to image annotation are closely related to im-age classification. Images are assigned a set of sample descriptions(predefined categories) such as people, landscape, indoor, outdoor, animal. Instead of focus-ing on the annotation task, they focus more on image processing and feature selection.

Co-occurrence Model [10], Translation Model [11], Latent Dirichlet Alloca-tion Model [12], Cross-Media Relevance Model [13], Multiple Bernoulli Relevance Model [14], etc infer the correlations or joint probabilities between images and an-notation keywords. Other works like linguistic indexing [15], and Multi-instanced learning [16] try to associate keywords(co ncepts) with images by learning classi-fiers. To develop accurate image annotation models, some manualy labeled data is required. Most of the approaches mentioned above have been developed and tested almost exclusively on the Corel 8 database. The latter contains 600 CD-ROMs, each containing about 100 images representing the same topic or concept, e.g., people, landscape, m ale. Each topic is associated with keywords and these are assumed to also describe the images under this topic. effective automatic image annotation. It is unlikely that models trained on Corel database will perform well o n other image collections.

Web images differ from general images in that they are associated by plentiful of texts. As we mentioned in earlier sections, examples of these associated texts include image file name, ALT text, caption, surrounding text and page title, etc.
Various approaches [18,19] have been employed to improve the performance of web image annotation based on associated texts. Our work differs from previous work in that our approach is evaluated on a large number of images and works well for any image dataset with associated texts. This paper presented a term weighting approach that makes use of term co-occurrences in associated texts and pr edicts terms occurring in ALT text of an image. We compared the performance of our approach against two baseline approaches which use term frequency and d ocument frequency respectively. Ex-periments on a large number of images showed that our model is able to achieve a good performance. One advantage of our approach is that it works well for any image dataset given the images have associated texts.

Having observed that semantic relatedness should be taken into account while evaluating, we would like to include this in the evaluation framework. We are work-ing on making the dataset used in our experiments a standard one for web image retrieval. Our work is language independent. Our work can be extended to other domains like social bookmarking sites. The goal would then be to predict the tags of a url from the text content of the url.
