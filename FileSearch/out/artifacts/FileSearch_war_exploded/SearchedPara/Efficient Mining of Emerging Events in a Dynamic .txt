 We present an efficient data mining technique for modeling multidimensional time environment. Given an ordered time series or a data stream that is composed of a (large) set of data points (events) collected by a real-world application, we are inter-ested in many cases in finding those events that are relatively new but potentially have significant impact on the system. The data mining technique is desired to model the dynamically changing profile and provide capabilities to accommodate new trend and to forget obsolete profile. 
The significance of mining emerging events rests on detecting them dynamically at an early stage. Thus we aim at finding them when they are rare but new in occurrence in a soft real time manner. The rarity of emerging events makes it related to identify-ing patterns of rarity [2-9]. However previous work does not address this problem in a dynamic spatiotemporal environment. First, existing algorithms require that the entire dataset be accessed at one time [5, 8, 10] or mine within a data window [3, 4, 9]. Min-ing with the entire dataset implicitly assumes stationarity and therefore losses the dynamically changing nature of the dataset. On the other hand, mining within a time window has made an assumption that the history prior to the window does not influ-ence current behavior and is totally forgettable. The second issue is that existing algo-rithms either keep temporal information of the datasets without examining spatial nore temporal dependency of data [3, 10]. In the practical examples such as computer network traffic, highway traffic and electric power demand management, both the spatial relationship of data points and their temporal dependency are important. 
Therefore previous related techniques can be viewed at three different levels. The detect those events which our deviate from the majority in the whole dataset. The second level work (surprising patterns, concept drifting) takes a time-variant statisti-cal distribution of the data profile into consideration. The third level work (emerging Moreover, mining of rarity can be either spatial or temporal or both. Our work repre-sents this new fourth level. 
The proposed technique is built based on the Extensible Markov model (EMM), a spatiotemporal modeling technique proposed by the authors [1]. EMM interleaves a clustering algorithm with a dynamic Markov chain to model spatiotemporal data. In this paper, modules for adding and deleting states of Markov chain are used in model-ing. To extract emerging events, an aging score of occurrences is proposed to reflect decay of importance. Both emerging events and obsolete events are judged using functions of the score and thus the proposed technique is able to continuously model the change of the data profile. The proposed technique inherits the traits of EMM and processing. In this section we present new EMM techniques to be used in the identification of emerging events. An additional labeling element, the aging score of occurrence (or transition) in EMM. We first define the score, and then investigate its properties and present how the score scheme is applied to identifying obsolete events and emerging events. The score of node or link is built using an indicator function : Here E k is an EMM component (either node or link) and  X  t is the current component of the same type at time t . We may eliminate the subscript k for simplicity. Definition 1: (Aging Score of Occurrence for an EMM component). At time t , the aging score of occurrence for an EMM component E is defined by where 0&lt;  X  &lt; 1 is an aging coefficient, t is current time. EMM. A cluster feature introduced by BIRCH [10] is defined using a vector of three 752 Y. Meng and M.H. Dunham second moment, SS j , of data points in a cluster. To use the score of the EMM compo-nents, we extend the labeling schemes of both with a score S t and a time t , as defined computation of e-CF and e-CL is as efficient as the adopted clustering method such as BIRCH. Definition 2: Extended Cluster Feature (e-CF) is a vector with five attributes to summarize the information of a cluster or a node at time t, defined by: Definition 3: Extended EMM Transition Labeling e-CL is defined by: The t indicates the last time that e-CF was updated. This makes us not have to update all EMM components at every time but only update current coponents.

In addition to the decay of importance, we use a sliding window to achieve the sta-tionary approximation. The idea is to examine whether a node of EMM has been otherwise the node is considered an obsolete node and will drop from EMM along with associated links. Note that not all links occurred within the sliding window. Definition 4: Obsolete Events. Assume current time is t . If an EMM node N o is not seen in a window [t-w, t] , it is recognized as an obsolete node. All links in and out of obsolete node N o are obsolete and are removed from EMM. Definition 5: Emerging Event. Assume a transition L ij between two EMM nodes N i emerging events if where  X  is a predefined threshold. Definition 5 discerns the EMM components with majority of occurrences introduced in the recent history and thus considered to be associated with developing trends. Scores of a node and a link are computed incrementally. In addition, two comparisons are needed to determine an emerging event. Thus for an EMM with m nodes, the time for these computations has O(1) complexity. Thus the proposed technique inherits the efficiency of the EMM framework. and effectiveness of the proposed technique. Experiments were performed on the VoIP traffic data provided by Cisco Systems which represents 1.5 million logged VoIP CDRs in their Richardson, Texas facility from Sep 22 to Nov 17. The site re-national, internal to international, as well as those in opposite directions were selected for investigation. Statistics were measured every 15 minutes. After preprocessing, there are 5422 points and the data format at each time point is: where D t denotes type of day, T t time of the day, and S it the value of statistic volume found at that call direction i , at time t . BIRCH and nearest neighbor clustering algo-rithms are used. Euclidean distance is used as the dissimilarity measure. Four pa-Default values, i.e. th = 30, w = 1000,  X  =0.01 and r = 0.9 are used unless the parame-ter is a variable of investigation. The th is calibrated using EMM prediction [1]. 
Fig. 1 illustrates the modeling process with increment of nodes (the envelope), deletions of obsolete nodes (x) and detections of emerging nodes (+) of EMM on the fly. The growth rate is sublinear and decreases as the time goes. The growth rate is space usage. Fig. 2 shows that the number of deletions dramatically changes with 754 Y. Meng and M.H. Dunham different window sizes. However the total run time of the application at hand does not change much as illustrated in Fig. 3. Further experiments show that examinations of both spatial and temporal relationships are important. Temporal dependency gives more conservative judgments. Plateaus exist for parameters such as window size, score/count ratio and decay coefficient, with which appropriate ranges of parameters that reflect the dynamic profile of the data can be determined. In this paper, we have presented an efficient data mining modeling technique suitable for finding emerging events in a spatiotemporal environment. The model accommodates anomaly, concept drifting, support, and temporality in one framework without losing time and space efficiency. Novel operations are proposed for deleting obsolete states, and finding emerging events based on a scoring scheme. Selection of parameters for appropriate capturing the dynamic data profile is found to have a range. Offline mining of the results generated by this model is possible for more complex patterns. 1.
