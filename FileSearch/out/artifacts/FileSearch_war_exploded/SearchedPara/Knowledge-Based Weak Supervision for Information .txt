 Information-extraction (IE), the process of generat-ing relational data from natural-language text, con-tinues to gain attention. Many researchers dream of creating a large repository of high-quality extracted tuples, arguing that such a knowledge base could benefit many important tasks such as question an-swering and summarization. Most approaches to IE use supervised learning of relation-specific exam-ples, which can achieve high precision and recall. Unfortunately, however, fully supervised methods are limited by the availability of training data and are unlikely to scale to the thousands of relations found on the Web.

A more promising approach, often called  X  X eak X  or  X  X istant X  supervision, creates its own training data by heuristically matching the contents of a database to corresponding text (Craven and Kum-lien, 1999). For example, suppose that r ( e 1 ,e 2 ) = Founded ( Jobs , Apple ) is a ground tuple in the database and s =  X  X teve Jobs founded Apple, Inc. X  is a sentence containing synonyms for both e 1 = Jobs and e 2 = Apple , then s may be a natural language expression of the fact that r ( e 1 ,e 2 ) holds and could be a useful training example.

While weak supervision works well when the tex-tual corpus is tightly aligned to the database con-tents ( e.g. , matching Wikipedia infoboxes to as-sociated articles (Hoffmann et al., 2010)), Riedel et al. (2010) observe that the heuristic leads to noisy data and poor extraction performance when the method is applied more broadly ( e.g. , matching Freebase records to NY Times articles). To fix this problem they cast weak supervision as a form of multi-instance learning, assuming only that at least one of the sentences containing e 1 and e 2 are ex-pressing r ( e 1 ,e 2 ) , and their method yields a sub-stantial improvement in extraction performance.
However, Riedel et al.  X  X  model (like that of previous systems (Mintz et al., 2009)) assumes that relations do not overlap  X  there cannot exist two facts r ( e 1 ,e 2 ) and q ( e 1 ,e 2 ) that are both true for any pair of entities, e 1 and e Unfortunately, this assumption is often violated; for example both Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple) are clearly true. In-deed, 18.3% of the weak supervision facts in Free-base that match sentences in the NY Times 2007 cor-pus have overlapping relations.

This paper presents M ULTI R, a novel model of weak supervision that makes the following contri-butions:  X  M ULTI R introduces a probabilistic, graphical  X  M ULTI R also produces accurate sentence-level  X  M ULTI R is computationally tractable. Inference  X  We present experiments showing that M ULTI R Given a corpus of text, we seek to extract facts about entities , such as the company Apple or the city Boston . A ground fact (or relation instance ), is an expression r ( e ) where r is a relation name, for example Founded or CEO-of , and e = e 1 ,...,e n is a list of entities.

An entity mention is a contiguous sequence of tex-tual tokens denoting an entity. In this paper we as-sume that there is an oracle which can identify all entity mentions in a corpus, but the oracle doesn X  X  normalize or disambiguate these mentions. We use e i  X  E to denote both an entity and its name ( i.e. , the tokens in its mention).

A relation mention is a sequence of text (in-cluding one or more entity mentions) which states that some ground fact r ( e ) is true. For example,  X  X teve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft, spoke recently at CES. X  contains three entity mentions as well as a relation mention for CEO-of(Steve Ballmer, Microsoft) . In this paper we restrict our atten-tion to binary relations. Furthermore, we assume that both entity mentions appear as noun phrases in a single sentence.
 The task of aggregate extraction takes two inputs,  X  , a set of sentences comprising the corpus, and an extraction model; as output it should produce a set of ground facts, I , such that each fact r ( e )  X  I is expressed somewhere in the corpus.

Sentential extraction takes the same input and likewise produces I , but in addition it also produces a function,  X  : I  X  P ( X ) , which identifies, for each r ( e )  X  I , the set of sentences in  X  that contain a mention describing r ( e ) . In general, the corpus-level extraction problem is easier, since it need only make aggregate predictions, perhaps using corpus-wide statistics. In contrast, sentence-level extrac-tion must justify each extraction with every sentence which expresses the fact.

The knowledge-based weakly supervised learning problem takes as input (1)  X  , a training corpus, (2) E , a set of entities mentioned in that corpus, (3) R , a set of relation names, and (4),  X  , a set of ground facts of relations in R . As output the learner pro-duces an extraction model. We define an undirected graphical model that al-lows joint reasoning about aggregate (corpus-level) and sentence-level extraction decisions. Figure 1(a) shows the model in plate form. 3.1 Random Variables There exists a connected component for each pair of entities e = ( e 1 ,e 2 )  X  E  X  E that models all of the extraction decisions for this pair. There is one Boolean output variable Y r for each relation name r  X  R, which represents whether the ground fact r ( e ) is true. Including this set of binary random variables enables our model to extract overlapping relations.
 contain mentions of both of the entities. For each sentence x i  X  S ( e Z i which ranges over the relation names r  X  R and, importantly, also the distinct value none . Z i should be assigned a value r  X  R only when x i expresses the ground fact r ( e ) , thereby modeling sentence-level extraction.

Figure 1(b) shows an example instantiation of the model with four relation names and three sentences. 3.2 A Joint, Conditional Extraction Model We use a conditional probability model that defines a joint distribution over all of the extraction random variables defined above. The model is undirected and includes repeated factors for making sentence level predictions as well as globals factors for ag-gregating these choices.

For each entity pair e = ( e 1 ,e 2 ) , define x to be a vector concatenating the individual sentences x i  X  S ( e 1 ,e 2 ) , Y to be vector of binary Y r random variables, one for each r  X  R , and Z to be the vec-tor of Z i variables, one for each sentence x i . Our conditional extraction model is defined as follows: where the parameter vector  X  is used, below, to de-fine the factor  X  extract .
 The factors  X  join are deterministic OR operators which are included to ensure that the ground fact r ( e ) is predicted at the aggregate level for the as-signment Y r = y r only if at least one of the sen-tence level assignments Z i = z i signals a mention of r ( e ) .
 The extraction factors  X  extract are given by where the features  X  j are sensitive to the relation name assigned to extraction variable z i , if any, and cues from the sentence x i . We will make use of the Mintz et al. (2009) sentence-level features in the ex-peiments, as described in Section 7. 3.3 Discussion This model was designed to provide a joint approach where extraction decisions are almost entirely driven by sentence-level reasoning. However, defining the Y r random variables and tying them to the sentence-level variables, Z i , provides a direct method for modeling weak supervision. We can simply train the model so that the Y variables match the facts in the database, treating the Z i as hidden variables that can take any value, as long as they produce the correct aggregate predictions.

This approach is related to the multi-instance learning approach of Riedel et al. (2010), in that both models include sentence-level and aggregate random variables. However, their sentence level variables are binary and they only have a single ag-gregate variable that takes values r  X  R  X  X  none } , thereby ruling out overlapping relations. Addition-ally, their aggregate decisions make use of Mintz-style aggregate features (Mintz et al., 2009), that col-lect evidence from multiple sentences, while we use
Inputs: (1)  X  , a set of sentences, (2) E , a set of entities mentioned in the sentences, (3) R , a set of relation names, and (4)  X  , a database of atomic facts of the form r ( e 1 ,e 2 ) for r  X  R and e i  X  E .
 Definitions:
We define the training set { ( x i , y i ) | i = 1 ...n } , where i is an index corresponding to a particu-lar entity pair ( e j ,e k ) in  X  , x i contains all of the sentences in  X  with mentions of this pair, and y i = relVector ( e j ,e k ).

Computation: initialize parameter vector  X   X  0 for t = 1 ...T do end for Return  X  only the deterministic OR nodes. Perhaps surpris-ing, we are still able to improve performance at both the sentential and aggregate extraction tasks. We now present a multi-instance learning algo-rithm for our weak-supervision model that treats the sentence-level extraction random variables Z i as la-tent, and uses facts from a database ( e.g. , Freebase) as supervision for the aggregate-level variables Y r . As input we have (1)  X  , a set of sentences, (2) E , a set of entities mentioned in the sentences, (3) R , a set of relation names, and (4)  X  , a database of atomic facts of the form r ( e 1 ,e 2 ) for r  X  R and e i  X  E . Since we are using weak learning, the Y r variables in Y are not directly observed, but can be approximated from the database  X  . We use a proce-dure, relVector ( e 1 ,e 2 ) to return a bit vector whose j th bit is one if r have a bit for the special none relation; if there is no relation between the two entities, all bits are zero.
Finally, we can now define the training set to be pairs { ( x i , y i ) | i = 1 ...n } , where i is an index corresponding to a particular entity pair ( e j ,e k ) , x contains all of the sentences with mentions of this pair, and y i = relVector ( e j ,e k ).

Given this form of supervision, we would like to find the setting for  X  with the highest likelihood:
O (  X  ) = Y
However, this objective would be difficult to op-timize exactly, and algorithms for doing so would be unlikely to scale to data sets of the size we con-sider. Instead, we make two approximations, de-scribed below, leading to a Perceptron-style addi-tive (Collins, 2002) parameter update scheme which has been modified to reason about hidden variables, similar in style to the approaches of (Liang et al., 2006; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007), but adapted for our specific model. This approximate algorithm is computationally efficient and, as we will see, works well in practice.

Our first modification is to do online learning instead of optimizing the full objective. Define the feature sums  X  ( x , z ) = P j  X  ( x j ,z j ) which range over the sentences, as indexed by j . Now, we can define an update based on the gradient of the local log likelihood for example i : where the deterministic OR  X  join factors ensure that the first expectation assigns positive probability only to assignments that produce the labeled facts y i but that the second considers all valid sets of extractions.
Of course, these expectations themselves, espe-cially the second one, would be difficult to com-pute exactly. Our second modification is to do a Viterbi approximation, by replacing the expecta-tions with maximizations. Specifically, we compute the most likely sentence extractions for the label facts arg max z p ( z | x i , y i ;  X  ) and the most likely ex-traction for the input, without regard to the labels, arg max y , z p ( y , z | x i ;  X  ) . We then compute the fea-tures for these assignments and do a simple additive update. The final algorithm is detailed in Figure 2. To support learning, as described above, we need to compute assignments arg max z p ( z | x , y ;  X  ) and arg max y , z p ( y , z | x ;  X  ) . In this section, we describe algorithms for both cases that use the deterministic OR nodes to simplify the required computations.
Predicting the most likely joint extraction arg max y , z p ( y , z | x ;  X  ) can be done efficiently given the structure of our model. In particular, we note that the factors  X  join represent deterministic de-pendencies between Z and Y , which when satisfied do not affect the probability of the solution. It is thus sufficient to independently compute an assignment for each sentence-level extraction variable Z i , ignor-ing the deterministic dependencies. The optimal set-ting for the aggregate variables Y is then simply the assignment that is consistent with these extractions. The time complexity is O ( | R | X | S | ) .

Predicting sentence level extractions given weak supervision facts, arg max z p ( z | x , y ;  X  ) , is more challenging. We start by computing extraction scores  X  extract ( x i ,z i ) for each possible extraction as-signment Z i = z i at each sentence x i  X  S , and storing the values in a dynamic programming table. Next, we must find the most likely assignment z that respects our output variables y . It turns out that this problem is a variant of the weighted, edge-cover problem, for which there exist polynomial time op-timal solutions.

Let G = ( E , V = V S  X  V y ) be a complete weighted bipartite graph with one node v S i  X  X  S for each sentence x i  X  S and one node v y r  X  X  y for each relation r  X  R where y r = 1 . The edge weights are to select a subset of the edges which maximizes the sum of their weights, subject to each node v S i  X  V S being incident to exactly one edge, and each node v r  X  X  y being incident to at least one edge.
 Exact Solution An exact solution can be obtained by first computing the maximum weighted bipartite matching, and adding edges to nodes which are not incident to an edge. This can be computed in time O ( |V| ( |E| + |V| log |V| )) , which we can rewrite as Approximate Solution An approximate solution can be obtained by iterating over the nodes in V y , and each time adding the highest weight incident edge whose addition doesn X  X  violate a constraint. The running time is O ( | R || S | ) . This greedy search guarantees each fact is extracted at least once and allows any additional extractions that increase the overall probability of the assignment. Given the computational advantage, we use it in all of the ex-perimental evaluations. We follow the approach of Riedel et al. (2010) for generating weak supervision data, computing fea-tures, and evaluating aggregate extraction. We also introduce new metrics for measuring sentential ex-traction performance, both relation-independent and relation-specific. 6.1 Data Generation We used the same data sets as Riedel et al. (2010) for weak supervision. The data was first tagged with the Stanford NER system (Finkel et al., 2005) and then entity mentions were found by collecting each continuous phrase where words were tagged iden-tically ( i.e. , as a person, location, or organization). Finally, these phrases were matched to the names of Freebase entities.
 Given the set of matches, define  X  to be set of NY Times sentences with two matched phrases, E to be the set of Freebase entities which were mentioned in one or more sentences,  X  to be the set of Freebase facts whose arguments, e 1 and e 2 were mentioned in a sentence in  X  , and R to be set of relations names used in the facts of  X  . These sets define the weak supervision data. 6.2 Features and Initialization We use the set of sentence-level features described by Riedel et al. (2010), which were originally de-veloped by Mintz et al. (2009). These include in-dicators for various lexical, part of speech, named entity, and dependency tree path properties of entity mentions in specific sentences, as computed with the Malt dependency parser (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004) and OpenNLP POS tagger 1 . However, unlike the previous work, we did not make use of any features that explicitly aggregate these properties across mul-tiple mention instances.

The M ULTI R algorithm has a single parameter T , the number of training iterations, that must be spec-ified manually. We used T = 50 iterations, which performed best in development experiments. 6.3 Evaluation Metrics Evaluation is challenging, since only a small per-centage (approximately 3%) of sentences match facts in Freebase, and the number of matches is highly unbalanced across relations, as we will see in more detail later. We use the following metrics. Aggregate Extraction Let  X  e be the set of ex-tracted relations for any of the systems; we com-pute aggregate precision and recall by comparing  X  e with  X  . This metric is easily computed but un-derestimates extraction accuracy because Freebase is incomplete and some true relations in  X  e will be marked wrong.
 Sentential Extraction Let S e be the sentences where some system extracted a relation and S F be the sentences that match the arguments of a fact in  X  . We manually compute sentential extraction ac-curacy by sampling a set of 1000 sentences from S e  X  S F and manually labeling the correct extrac-tion decision, either a relation r  X  R or none . We then report precision and recall for each system on this set of sampled sentences. These results provide a good approximation to the true precision but can overestimate the actual recall, since we did not man-ually check the much larger set of sentences where no approach predicted extractions. 6.4 Precision / Recall Curves To compute precision / recall curves for the tasks, we ranked the M ULTI R extractions as follows. For sentence-level evaluations, we ordered according to the extraction factor score  X  extract ( z i ,x i ) . For aggre-gate comparisons, we set the score for an extraction Y r = true to be the max of the extraction factor scores for the sentences where r was extracted. To evaluate our algorithm, we first compare it to an existing approach for using multi-instance learning with weak supervision (Riedel et al., 2010), using the same data and features. We report both aggregate extraction and sentential extraction results. We then investigate relation-specific performance of our sys-tem. Finally, we report running time comparisons. 7.1 Aggregate Extraction Figure 4 shows approximate precision / recall curves for three systems computed with aggregate metrics (Section 6.3) that test how closely the extractions match the facts in Freebase. The systems include the original results reported by Riedel et al. (2010) as well as our new model (M ULTI R). We also compare with S OLO R, a reimplementation of their algorithm, which we built in Factorie (McCallum et al., 2009), and will use later to evaluate sentential extraction.
M ULTI R achieves competitive or higher preci-sion over all ranges of recall, with the exception of the very low recall range of approximately 0-1%. It also significantly extends the highest recall achieved, from 20% to 25%, with little loss in preci-sion. To investigate the low precision in the 0-1% re-call range, we manually checked the ten highest con-fidence extractions produced by M ULTI R that were marked wrong. We found that all ten were true facts that were simply missing from Freebase. A manual evaluation, as we perform next for sentential extrac-tion, would remove this dip. 7.2 Sentential Extraction Although their model includes variables to model sentential extraction, Riedel et al. (2010) did not re-port sentence level performance. To generate the precision / recall curve we used the joint model as-signment score for each of the sentences that con-tributed to the aggregate extraction decision.
Figure 4 shows approximate precision / recall curves for M ULTI R and S OLO R computed against manually generated sentence labels, as defined in Section 6.3. M ULTI R achieves significantly higher recall with a consistently high level of precision. At the highest recall point, M ULTI R reaches 72.4% pre-cision and 51.9% recall, for an F1 score of 60.5%. 7.3 Relation-Specific Performance Since the data contains an unbalanced number of in-stances of each relation, we also report precision and recall for each of the ten most frequent relations. Let S r be the sentences where M ULTI R extracted an instance of relation r  X  R , and let S F r be the sen-tences that match the arguments of a fact about re-lation r in  X  . For each r , we sample 100 sentences from both S M r and S F r and manually check accu-racy. To estimate precision  X  P r we compute the ratio of true relation mentions in S M r , and to estimate re-call  X  R r we take the ratio of true relation mentions in S r which are returned by our system.

Table 1 presents this approximate precision and recall for M ULTI R on each of the relations, along with statistics we computed to measure the qual-ity of the weak supervision. Precision is high for the majority of relations but recall is consistently lower. We also see that the Freebase matches are highly skewed in quantity and can be low quality for some relations, with very few of them actually cor-responding to true extractions. The approach gener-ally performs best on the relations with a sufficiently large number of true matches, in many cases even achieving precision that outperforms the accuracy of the heuristic matches, at reasonable recall levels. 7.4 Overlapping Relations Table 1 also highlights some of the effects of learn-ing with overlapping relations. For example, in the data, almost all of the matches for the administra-tive divisions relation overlap with the contains re-lation, because they both model relationships for a pair of locations. Since, in general, sentences are much more likely to describe a contains relation, this overlap leads to a situation were almost none of the administrate division matches are true ones, and we cannot accurately learn an extractor. However, we can still learn to accurately extract the contains rela-tion, despite the distracting matches. Similarly, the place of birth and place of death relations tend to overlap, since it is often the case that people are born and die in the same city. In both cases, the precision outperforms the labeling accuracy and the recall is relatively high.

To measure the impact of modeling overlapping relations, we also evaluated a simple, restricted baseline. Instead of labeling each entity pair with the set of all true Freebase facts, we created a dataset where each true relation was used to create a dif-ferent training example. Training M ULTI R on this data simulates effects of conflicting supervision that can come from not modeling overlaps. On average across relations, precision increases 12 points but re-call drops 26 points, for an overall reduction in F1 score from 60.5% to 40.3%. 7.5 Running Time One final advantage of our model is the mod-est running time. Our implementation of the Riedel et al. (2010) approach required approxi-mately 6 hours to train on NY Times 05-06 and 4 hours to test on the NY Times 07, each without pre-processing. Although they do sampling for infer-ence, the global aggregation variables require rea-soning about an exponentially large (in the number of sentences) sample space.

In contrast, our approach required approximately one minute to train and less than one second to test, on the same data. This advantage comes from the decomposition that is possible with the determinis-tic OR aggregation variables. For test, we simply consider each sentence in isolation and during train-ing our approximation to the weighted assignment problem is linear in the number of sentences. 7.6 Discussion The sentential extraction results demonstrates the advantages of learning a model that is primarily driven by sentence-level features. Although previ-ous approaches have used more sophisticated fea-tures for aggregating the evidence from individual sentences, we demonstrate that aggregating strong sentence-level evidence with a simple deterministic OR that models overlapping relations is more effec-tive, and also enables training of a sentence extractor that runs with no aggregate information.

While the Riedel et al. approach does include a model of which sentences express relations, it makes significant use of aggregate features that are primar-ily designed to do entity-level relation predictions and has a less detailed model of extractions at the individual sentence level. Perhaps surprisingly, our model is able to do better at both the sentential and aggregate levels. Supervised-learning approaches to IE were intro-duced in (Soderland et al., 1995) and are too nu-merous to summarize here. While they offer high precision and recall, these methods are unlikely to scale to the thousands of relations found in text on the Web. Open IE systems, which perform self-supervised learning of relation-independent extrac-tors ( e.g. , Preemptive IE (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006), T EXT R UNNER (Banko et al., 2007; Banko and Etzioni, 2008) and W OE (Wu and Weld, 2010)) can scale to millions of documents, but don X  X  output canonicalized relations. 8.1 Weak Supervision Weak supervision (also known as distant-or self su-pervision) refers to a broad class of methods, but we focus on the increasingly-popular idea of using a store of structured data to heuristicaly label a tex-tual corpus. Craven and Kumlien (1999) introduced the idea by matching the Yeast Protein Database (YPD) to the abstracts of papers in PubMed and training a naive-Bayes extractor. Bellare and Mc-Callum (2007) used a database of BibTex records to train a CRF extractor on 12 bibliographic rela-tions. The K YLIN system aplied weak supervision to learn relations from Wikipedia, treating infoboxes as the associated database (Wu and Weld, 2007); Wu et al. (2008) extended the system to use smooth-ing over an automatically generated infobox taxon-omy. Mintz et al. (2009) used Freebase facts to train 100 relational extractors on Wikipedia. Hoffmann et al. (2010) describe a system similar to K YLIN , but which dynamically generates lexicons in order to handle sparse data, learning over 5000 Infobox relations with an average F1 score of 61%. Yao et al. (2010) perform weak supervision, while using selectional preference constraints to a jointly reason about entity types.

The N ELL system (Carlson et al., 2010) can also be viewed as performing weak supervision. Its ini-tial knowledge consists of a selectional preference constraint and 20 ground fact seeds. N ELL then matches entity pairs from the seeds to a Web cor-pus, but instead of learning a probabilistic model, it bootstraps a set of extraction patterns using semi-supervised methods for multitask learning. 8.2 Multi-Instance Learning Multi-instance learning was introduced in order to combat the problem of ambiguously-labeled train-ing data when predicting the activity of differ-ent drugs (Dietterich et al., 1997). Bunescu and Mooney (2007) connect weak supervision with multi-instance learning and extend their relational extraction kernel to this context.

Riedel et al. (2010), combine weak supervision and multi-instance learning in a more sophisticated manner, training a graphical model, which assumes only that at least one of the matches between the arguments of a Freebase fact and sentences in the corpus is a true relational mention. Our model may be seen as an extension of theirs, since both models include sentence-level and aggregate random vari-ables. However, Riedel et al. have only a single ag-gregate variable that takes values r  X  R  X  { none } , thereby ruling out overlapping relations. We have discussed the comparison in more detail throughout the paper, including in the model formulation sec-tion and experiments. We argue that weak supervision is promising method for scaling information extraction to the level where it can handle the myriad, different relations on the Web. By using the contents of a database to heuris-tically label a training corpus, we may be able to automatically learn a nearly unbounded number of relational extractors. Since the processs of match-ing database tuples to sentences is inherently heuris-tic, researchers have proposed multi-instance learn-ing algorithms as a means for coping with the result-ing noisy data. Unfortunately, previous approaches assume that all relations are disjoint  X  for exam-ple they cannot extract the pair Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple) , because two relations are not allowed to have the same argu-ments.

This paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extraction model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts. We apply our model to learn extrac-tors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Freebase. Experiments show improvements for both sentential and aggregate (corpus level) extraction, and demonstrate that the approach is computation-ally efficient.

Our early progress suggests many interesting di-rections. By joining two or more Freebase tables, we can generate many more matches and learn more relations. We also wish to refine our model in order to improve precision. For example, we would like to add type reasoning about entities and selectional preference constraints for relations. Finally, we are also interested in applying the overall learning ap-proaches to other tasks that could be modeled with weak supervision, such as coreference and named entity classification.
