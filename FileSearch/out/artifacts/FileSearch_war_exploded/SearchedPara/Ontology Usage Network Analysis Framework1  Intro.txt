 A decade-long effort by the Semantic Web community regarding knowledge representation and assimilation has resulted in the development of methodolo-gies, tools and technologies to develop and manage ontologies [1]. As a result, numerous domain ontologies have been developed to describe the information pertaining to different domains such as Healthcare and Life Science (HCLS), entertainment, financial services and e Commerce. Consequently, we now have billions of triples [2] on the Web in different domains, annotated by using dif-ferent domain-specific ontologies [3] to p rovide structured an d semantically rich data on the Web.

In our previous work [4], Ontology Usage Analysis Framework (OUSAF) is presented in order to analyse the use of ontologies on the web. The OUSAF framework is comprised of four phases namely identification , investigation , rep-resentation and utilization . The identification phase, which is the focus of this paper, is responsible for identifying different ontologies that are being used in a particular application area or in a given dataset for further analysis. A few of the common requirements which form the selection criteria for the identification of ontologies in this scenario are: 1. What are the widely used ontologies in the given application? 2. What ontologies are more interlinked with other ontologies to describe 3. What ontologies are used more frequently and what is their usage percentage 4. Which ontology clusters form cohesive groups? In order to establish a better understanding of ontology usage and to identify the ontologies, based on the abovementioned criteria, this paper proposes the Ontology Usage Network Analysis Framework (OUN-AF) that models the use of ontologies by different data sources using an Ontology Usage Network (OUN). OUN represents the relationships between ontologies and data sources based on the actual usage data available on the Web in the form of a graph-based relationship structure. This structure is then analysed using metrics to study the structural, typological and functional characteristics of OUN by applying Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques. 2.1 Related Work In [5], the authors have analyzed the social and structural relationships avail-able on the Semantic Web, focusing mainly on FOAF and DC vocabularies. The study was performed on approximately 1.5 million FOAF documents to analyze instance data available on the Web and their usefulness in understanding so-cial structures and network s. They identified the graphical patterns emerging in social networks and represented this using the FOAF vocabulary and the de-gree distribution of the network. As this research provides a detailed analysis of Semantic Web data by focusing on a specific vocabulary, it does not provide a framework or methodology to make it applicable to different vocabularies.
Other work in the literature has analyzed a different number of ontologies using SNA. For example, [6] covered five ontologies, [7] analyzed 250 ontologies and [8] used approximately 3,000 vocabularies. In all these work, ontologies were investigated to measure their structural properties, the distribution of different measures and terminological knowledge encoded in ontologies, but none includes how they are being used on the Web. The use of SNA and its techniques to anal-yse the use of ontologies and measure the relationships based on usage has only been applied marginally. In the identification phase of the OUSAF framework, the ontologies and their use by different data sources are represented in a way that allows the  X  X ffiliation X  between ontologies and different data publishers to be measured. 2.2 Affiliation Network Networks, in general sense, record relati onships between entities. However, in affiliation network relationship reflect the affiliation between entities and the events in which entities participate. Affiliation Networks are essentially two-mode networks comprised of two disjoint sets of nodes with links which always are between a node of one set and a node of the other. Affiliation networks are represented through an affiliation matrix, A = { a ij } .Matrix A is a two-mode sociomatrix in which rows represen t actors and columns represent events. Generally, affiliation network A is defined as: A is a bipartite graph A =( U, V, E ) where U (often known as actors) and V (often known as events) are disjoint set of nodes and E  X  ( UXV )isthesetofedges.With p = | V | and q = | U | , A is represented by an incident matrix with p lines and q columns. Formally, A = { a ij } records the affiliation of each actor with each event in an affiliation matrix such that: event ( j th column) and an entry of 0 if i th actor is not affiliated with j th event asshowninFig.1.

Often, two-mode networks are transformed into a one-mode network by a procedure called projection which generates a one-mode network by selecting nodes of one set (e.g. authors in Fig. 1) and linking two nodes from the set if both are connected to the same node of the other set. The objective of the ontology identification is to identify the use of different on-tologies by different data publishers to discover hidden usage patterns. Therefore, in order to mine such analysis, the Ontology Usage Network Analysis Framework (OUN-AF) is proposed, as shown in Fig. 2. OUN-AF comprises three phases, namely Input phase, Computation phase and Analysis phase. 3.1 Input Phase The input phase is responsible for managing the dataset. The two key compo-nents in this phase are a crawler and an RDF triple store. In order to point the crawler to relevant and interesting data s ources, the bootstrapping process first builds the seed URIs as multiple starting points. A list of seed URIs is obtained by accessing semantic search engines which return the URIs (URLs) of the data sources (web sites) with stru ctured data. The crawler collects the Semantic Web data (RDF data) and after preprocessing it, loads it to the RDF triple store (database). From a data management point of view, since RDF data comprises triples (statements) which do not provide a default mechanism to group or as-sociate certain sets of triples to a co ntext, the Named Graph approach is used which enables the provision of contextualization by introducing an additional URI (context) to a set of related triples. 3.2 Computation Phase The computation phase provides the computational architecture to transform the RDF data to a model so that further analysis can be performed. The OUN-AF transforms the data into two formats: two-mode affiliation network (i.e. Ontology Usage Network ) and the subsequent one-mode networks (i.e. Ontology Co-Usability and Data-Source Collaboration networks).
 Ontology Usage Network (OUN) : OUN is an affiliation network represented as a bipartite graph. OUN comprises ontology and datasource sets of nodes with an edge between the ontology node and data-source node if the ontology has been used by the data source. To formally define the Ontology Usage Network, first the two sets of nodes, namely ontology set and data-source set are defined and then the OUN definition is presented.  X  An ontology set is defined as the set O which represents the nodes of the  X  X data-sourceset is defined as the set D which has the list of hostnames  X  The Ontology Usage Network (OUN) is a bipartite graph, denoted as In order to infer the connectedness present within one set of nodes based on their co-participation in the other set of nodes, OUN is transformed from a two-mode network to a one-mode network using the process of projection. Projection is used to generate two one-mode graphs; one for nodes in the ontology set known as the Ontology Co-Usability network, and second for the data-source set known as the Data-Source Collaboration network as shown in Fig. 2.

The Ontology Co-Usability network is an ontology-to-ontology network, in which two nodes are connected if both of the ontologies are being used by the same data source. This means that the Ontology Co-Usability network rep-resents the connectedness of an ontology with other ontologies, based on their co-membership in the data source.

The Data-Source Collaboration network is a data-source-to-data-source network in which two nodes are connected if both of them have used the same on-tology to describe their data. The Data-Source Collaboration network represents the similarity of data-sources in terms of their need to semantically describe the information on the Web. 3.3 Analysis Phase The analysis phase is the third and last phase of OUN-AF. The objective of this phase is to mine the hidden relationships explicitly or implicitly present in the two-mode network (i.e. OUN) and one-mode networks (Ontology Co-Usability and Data-Source Collaboration). This is done by developing metrics for analyse the two-and one-mode network a s described in next section. The metrics used for the identification phase are presented below. 4.1 Ontology Usage Distribution (OUD) The metric Ontology Usage Distribution, OUD k , is used to identify which frac-tion of the ontologies in the network have a degree k . OUD measures the degree distribution of ontologies in an affiliation network. In affiliation network, the degree of a node is the number of ties it has with the number of nodes of the other set. The degree centrality C D ( o i ) of an ontology o i is measured as: affiliation matrix representing OUN. 4.2 Semanticity Semanticity distribution identifies the fraction of the data sources in the net-work which have a degree k . Semanticity measures the participation of different ontologies in a given data source. The more ontologies are being used by a data source, the higher semanticity value it has . Semanticity is measured by calculat-ing the degree centrality and degree distribution on the second set of nodes in an affiliation network, which is the set representing the data sources present in the dataset. The degree centrality C D ( ds i ) of a data source ds i is measured as: is the affiliation matrix representing OUN 4.3 Betweenness and Closeness Centrality Like Ontology Co-Usability, both these centrality measures are computed on the projected one-mode network.

Betweenness Centrality is the number of shortest paths between any two nodes that passes through the given node. The betweenness centrality C B ( v i ) of a node v is measured as : where  X  st is the number of shortest paths between vertices v s and v t .
And  X  st ( v i ) is the number of shortest paths between v s and v t that pass through v i .

Closeness centrality is a measure of the overall position of a node (actor) in the network, giving an idea about how long it takes to reach other nodes in the network from a given starting node. Closeness measures reachability, that is, how fast a given node (actor) can reach everyone in the network [9] and is defined as: where d ( v, u ) denotes the length of a shortest-path between v and u . The close-ness centrality of v is the inverse of the average (shortest path) distance from v to any other vertex in the graph. The higher the c v , the shorter the average distance from v to other vertices, and v is more important by this measure. 4.4 Cohesive Subgroups Generally speaking, cohesive subgroups refer to the areas of the network in which actors are more clos ely related to each other than actors outside the group. Cohesive subgroups are often measures using n-clique, in which it is not required that each member of the clique has a direct tie with the others, but instead that it has to be no more than distance n from each other. Formally, a clique is the maximum number of actors who have all possible ties present between them. The detail of dataset which is used to populate OUN and the analysis performed using metrics defined above, are discussed as follows. 5.1 Dataset and Its Characteristics In order to build a dataset which has a fair representation of the Semantic Web data described using domain ontologies, semantic search engines such as Sindice and Swoogle are used to build the seed URLs. These seed URLs are then used to crawl the structured data published on the Web using ontologies. The dataset built for the identification phase comprises 22.3 millions of triples, collected from 211 data sources 1 . In this dataset, 44 namespaces are used to describe entities semantically.

The resulting Ontology Usage Network is comprise of 1390 edges linking 44 ontologies to 211 data sources. In terms of generic OUN properties, the density of the network is 0.149 and the average degree is 10.90. The average degree shows that the network is neither too sparse nor too dense which is a common pattern in information networks. Details on the o ther properties and metrics are given in the following subsections. 5.2 Analysing Ontology Usage Distribution (OUD) Through OUD, we would like to determine how the use of an ontology is dis-tributed over the data sources in the dataset. Using Eq. 2, Fig. 3(a) shows the percentage of the ontologies being used by a number of different data sources. The relative frequency of OUD on the dataset shows that there is both extreme and average ontology usage by data sources. It also shows that 13.6% of on-tologies are not used by any of the data sources and approximately half of the ontologies are exclusively used by the data sources. The second row of the Fig. 3(a) shows that 47.7% of ontologies (21 ontologies) are being used by a data source that has not used any other ontology. This means that there are several ontologies in the dataset which either conceptualize a very specialized domain, restricting their reusability, or are of a proprietary nature. From the third row of Fig. 3(a) onwards, there is an increase in the reusability factor of ontologies. This is because an increasingly large number of data sources are using them. The last row shows that 4.5% (2 ontologies) of ontologies are being used equally by 208 data sources. Through this analysis, we can see that there are less ontologies which are not being used at all and there are a few which have almost optimal utilization.

Fig. 3(b) shows the degree distribution of ontology usage in a number of data sources. The value of degree is shown on the x-axis and the number of ontologies with that degree is shown on the y-axis. It can be seen that there are a large number of ontologies with a small degree value and only a few ontologies have a larger degree value.
 5.3 Analysing Semanticity Semanticity measures the richness of a data source in terms of ontology usage. Using Eq. 3, in the OUN, it is found that on average, 6.6 ontologies per data source are used in the dataset which, in our view, is an encouragingly high semanticity value, particularly bearing in mind that there are several ontologies with very low ontology usage degree values such as 0 and 1, as described in the previous section on Ontology Usage Distribution section. After determining the average semanticity of the data sources, we then look at their degree distribution. Figure 4(a) shows the relative frequency of ontologies being used by a number of data sources. The degree distribution of ontology usage per data source is different from ontology usage distribution.

At the lowest, in the network, two ontologieswww.oettl.it and www.openlinksw. com are used by one data source, which s hows the lowest semanticity value and 14 is the maximum semanticity value which is also used by one data source. When the data sources X  degree distribution is plotted, it follows the Gaussian distribu-tion, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Gaussian distribution [10], which is essentially a bell shaped curve, is normally concentrated in the centre and decreases on either side. This signifies that degree has less tende ncy to produce extreme values compared to power law distribution. 5.4 Analysing Betweenness and Closeness Betweenness centrality measures the number of shortest paths going through a certain node. However, on the other hand, the closeness centrality of a node in the network is the inverse of the average shortest path distance from the node to any other node in the network [11].

In the context of the Ontology Co-usage network, the interpretation of be-tweenness and closeness measures are diff erent from other collaboration networks such as co-authorship collaboration networks [12]. In betweenness, which is mea-sured using Eq. 4, the nodes of larger values are considered to be the hub of the network, controlling the communication flow (or becoming the major facilitator) between nodes with a geodesic path passing through these hub. In the Ontol-ogy Co-usage network, ontologies are linked based on the fact that these are being co-used by the data sources, therefore we believe the ontologies with max-imum betweenness centrality act as a semantic gateway and become a major motivational factor for the usage of other ontologies.

Likewise, in closeness centrality which is measured using Eq. 5, the larger the value, the shorter the average distance from the node to any other node, and thus the node (with a larger value) is positioned in the best location to spread information quickly [13]. This centrality measure in the ontology co-usage graph enables the establishment of correspondence between ontologies which have concepts related to each other, supplementing each others concep-tual model to form an exploded domain. The utilization of ontology indexing based on closeness centrality is very similar to the features discussed in [14] in supporting the application specific use of ontologies such as: (i) the ontologies closer to each other in their usage are better candidates for vocabulary alignment; (ii) ontologies closer to each other have more entities which correspond to en-tities of other ontologies; and (iii) closely related ontologies tend to facilitate query answering on the Semantic Web.

The betweenness and closeness centrality of ontology co-usage nodes is shown in Fig. 5(a) and 5(b), respectively and no de size reflects the centrality value.
As we can see in Fig. 5(a), the Ontology Co-Usage network has very few nodes with a higher betweenness value which means that the ontologies represented by the green nodes (which are not many) are the ones falling in between the geodesic path of many other nodes and acting as the gateway (or hub) in the communication between other ontologies in the graph. These are the nodes, namely rdf , rdfs , gr , vCard and foaf which, in our interpretation, are acting as the semantic gateway by becoming the rea son for the adoption of other ontologies on the Web. However, on the other hand, cl oseness centrality is approximately distributed evenly in the network. Thus, it is safe to assume that almost every node is reachable to other nodes except those which are not connected. 5.5 Analysing Cohesive Subgroups In a collaboration graph such as the Ontology Co-Usage network, a connected component is a maximal set of ontologies that are mutually reachable (and con-nected) through a chain of (co-usage) links. A cohesive sub-group analysis to identify connected components of the Ontology Co-Usage network shows that the network is widely connected. The co nnected component is 86.36% (See Fig-ure 6), in which only six are not connect ed in the network (this means 0-core), while others are connected with varying k-core values) making it a giant net-work since it encompasses the majority of the nodes. This means that 86.36% of the ontologies are reachable to each other by following the links (domain names URIs) of the data sources included in the dataset (or on the Web to generalize it). Note that the size of the cohesive sub-group, in terms of percentage, closely matches the findings of [15] for the classical Web which was 91%. Within the giant connected component, to know th e sub-component based on the equal dis-tribution of the concentration of links around a set of nodes, k-core is computed. k-core is the maximum sub-graph in which each node has at least degree k within the sub-graph. Fig. 6 stacks the k-core components, based on ascending k values from highest to lowest. From Figure 6, it is easy to see which ontologies are highly linked, based on ontology usage patterns invariance across data sources. In this paper, the use ontologies by different data sources are analysed by repre-senting the ontology usage related data in the form of affiliation network. Using different metrics the network is analyse d to understand the usage patterns in real world settings. In future work, we would like to enrich the dataset by crawling more data sources and automating the analyses process.
