 An important task of temporal event sequence mining is to predict the occur-rences of a special type of event, called target event, in a long sequence. Sub-stantial work [1 X 4] has been done for target event prediction in a long temporal event sequence. Particularly, in our previous work [3], we have defined a new type of pattern, called event oriented pattern, to address this research problem. In general, the discovered event-oriented pattern P is represented as the predic-tion rule r = P T =  X  e , where e is target event type and T is the temporal constraint indicating the time period for target event prediction. The prediction rule r can be interpreted as: if pattern P occurs, the target event is likely to occur within a T -sized interval.
 diction because it is closely related to the sensibility of the prediction rule. So, in our event-oriented pattern discovery problem, T is pre-defined by domain ex-perts to ensure that all prediction rules discovered under the parameter T are sensible in the given application domain. However, in the event-oriented pattern discovery, an important observation (as will be explained later) is that if a rule P T 1 =  X  e is interesting in term of the interestingness measures, for any T the rule P T 2 =  X  e is interesting as well. Thus, pre-defining T may cause the side-effect on the accuracy of prediction.
 network fault analysis. Assume that an event-oriented pattern P can lead to the trouble report (TR) within 12 hours. However, in the process of pattern discovery, domain experts set the temporal constraint T as 24 hours (which is believed sensible to the application domain). According to the observation, P is Compared with the fact P 12 hrs =  X  e ,therule r is lack of accuracy in term of the size of interval for prediction. Such inaccurate prediction rules sometimes carry misleading information. For example, if domain experts take 24 hours as the interval in which P will lead to TRs, they may underestimate the emergency that TRs will occur and therefore, fail to take corresponding precautions in time.
 dress the above problem. Given an event-oriented pattern P, the temporal feature of
P , denoted as T ( P ) , is defined as the minimal size of interval that makes P interesting in terms of the interestingness measures. Based on this new concept, we can solve the problem in two steps. First, as done in our previous work, a set of event-oriented patterns are discovered under a given size of interval T , where T is believed as the maximal sensible size of interval for prediction in the application domain. Then, we further analyze the mining result, i.e., for each interesting pattern P (discovered under the parameter T ), we try to find its temporal feature T ( P ) . In this case, the corresponding prediction rule of P is refined from P T =  X  e to P T ( P ) =  X  e , which carries more accurate temporal information for the target event predication.
 of mining event-oriented patterns. In Section 3, the problem of discovering tem-poral features is formulated and further discussed. In Section 4, we propose approaches to find temporal features of event-oriented patterns. Section 5 shows the experiment results. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 6. In this section, we review some key concepts of discovering event-oriented pat-terns in a long temporal sequence.
 a  X  E and t is a timestamp . We define one special event type e as the tar-get event type . Any event of type e is called a target event .A temporal event sequence ,or sequence in short, is a list of events totally ordered by their times-tamps.
 time of w respectively. The window size of w is defined as t e  X  t s .A sequence fragment f ( S, w ) is the part of sequence S determined by w . fragment f ( S, w ) is called to contain a pattern P if there exist events in f ( S, w ) that can match P . Given a pattern P and a sequence S , the approach in [1] can identify all the occurrences, called minimal occurrences (OWs) ,of P in S . event type, P is a event-oriented pattern ,and T is the size of interval. Generally, a prediction rule can be interpreted as: the occurrence of P is likely to lead to the target event in a T -sized interval.
 Before giving the definition of support and confidence, we first formally define the dataset prior to target events.
 window w i =[ t i  X  T,t i ] and get the sequence fragment f i = f ( S, w i ). The set of these sequence fragments D = { f 1 ,f 2 ,...,f m } is called the local dataset of target event type e .
 Definition 2.1 (Support). Given a sequence S and a prediction rule r = where D is the local dataset of e.
 Definition 2.2 (Confidence). Given a sequence S and a prediction rule r =
P T =  X  e ,the confidence of r is defined as Conf ( r )= i # MO in f i f is the sequence fragment in the local dataset D.
 given a sequence S , a target event type e , a window size T , two thresholds s 0 and c 0 , to find any event-oriented pattern in the form of r = P T =  X  e such that Supp ( r )  X  s 0 and Conf ( r )  X  c 0 . In this section, we first give the formal definition of the temporal feature. Then, we prove that the temporal feature exists for any interesting event-oriented pat-tern. Finally, we formulate the problem of finding temporal features.
 Definition 3.1 (Temporal feature) . Given an interesting event-oriented pat-tern P (discovered from the sequence S under a window size T and threshold s 0 and dow size that makes P interesting, i.e., 1) both Supp ( P T ( P ) =  X  e )  X  s 0 and erty of support and confidence.
 Claim 3.1 (Monotony of support and confidence with window size T ).
 Given a pattern P , for any two window sizes T 1 and T 2 with T 1  X  T 2 , we have Proof. The proof is straightforward according to Definitions 2.1 and 2.2. Claim 3.2 (Existence of temporal feature) . For any interesting pattern P (discovered from the sequence S under a window size T and threshold s 0 and c ), the temporal feature T ( P ) exists.
 Proof. First, for a given pattern P , we define the temporal feature w.r.t sup-port as the minimal window size that makes the pattern P interesting in terms of support (i.e., the support of P is no less than the given support threshold). Similarly, the temporal feature w.r.t. confidence is defined as the minimal win-dow size that makes P interesting in terms of confidence. Thanks to Claim 3.1, for any interesting pattern P discovered under the window size T, there exist the temporal feature w.r.t support and the temporal feature w.r.t confidence, Problem Definition. The problem of finding temporal features can be formu-lated as: given a set PS of interesting pattern event-oriented patterns (discovered from the sequence S under a window size T and threshold s 0 and c 0 ), for any pattern P  X  PS, to refine the corresponding prediction rule P T =  X  e to a new rule P T ( P ) =  X  e , where T ( P ) is the temporal feature of P. In this section, we discuss how to find the temporal feature of a single interesting pattern P . According to the proof of Claim 3.2, our task is naturally decomposed into two sub-tasks, i.e., finding temporal feature w.r.t. support and finding tem-poral feature w.r.t. confidence.
 Finding Temporal Feature w.r.t. Support. Suppose that the total number of target events is m . For each target event v i =( e, t i ) where i is from 1 to m , we first find a window size T i such that T i is the minimal window size that makes the sequence fragment in [ t i  X  T i ,t i ) contain P . We call T i the initial window size of the target event v i in terms of the pattern P . In this case, for all target events from v 1 to v m , we can create a vector of initial window size (in terms of P ), denoted as VS ( P ) . Then, we could sort VS ( P ) on the ascending order, and by definition, the temporal feature w.r.t. support T ( P ) Supp should be the ([ s Finding Temporal Feature w.r.t. Confidence. Suppose the total number of occurrences of a pattern P in S is N . Let us consider one target event v i =( e, t i ). Suppose that P occurs k times in the interval [ t i  X  T,t i ) , where is T the pre-given window size for discovering P. We can find k special window sizes ( T 1 ,T 2 ...T k ) such that for each T j ( j =1  X  X  X  k ), 1) P occurs j times in the sequence fragment in [ t i  X  T j ,t i )and2) T j is the minimal window size that holding condition 1). For all target events, we can create a vector VC ( P ) which consists of all such special window sizes in terms of pattern P . After sorting VC ( P ) on the ascending order confidence threshold.
 Improvement. Suppose that the temporal feature w.r.t. support of P , T ( P ) Supp , has been found. According to Definition 3.1, the temporal feature T ( P ) should on this observation, we do the improvement as follows. Let N Supp be the number of occurrences of P in the T ( P ) Supp -sized windows before target events. During the reverse scan for creating the vector VC ( P ) , for any special window with size T i &lt; = T ( as we already find the temporal feature T ( P ) = T ( P ) Supp . Otherwise, let N be [ c that it is also the temporal feature T ( P ) ). In this section, we the show experiment results of the application of telecommu-nication network fault analysis. The telecommunication event database contains 120,312 events, covering 190 event types. The population of target events is 2,317. In the experiment, all patterns to be further investigated are discovered under the conditions T =12 hrs , s 0 =5% , and c 0 = 20%. The experiment results show that the temporal features of those event-oriented patterns are ranged from 40% to 97% as large as T . Table 1 gives some samples of our mining results, illustrat-ing that how the temporal features improve the accuracy of prediction rules. rule { A 1 ,E 2 } 12 hrs =  X  e with support 24.46% and confidence 40.04%. However, with the thresholds s 0 =5%and c 0 = 20%, a window size of 4.83 hrs can already be significant enough for predicting the target events. Compared with the initial predicting rule, the size of prediction interval is only 40.25% as large as T. So, the new prediction rule is more accurate and sensible in term of the size of interval for prediction. Another observation is that for some prediction rules whose interestingness measures are close to the thresholds (e.g., the prediction rule of pattern { A 2 ,F 1 ,F 2 } ), finding temporal features could also considerably reduce the size of prediction interval, with marginal decrease on the values of interestingness measures.
 features from sequences with different length. Figure 1 shows such a result under the condition T =12 hrs, s 0 = 5%, and c 0 = 20%. We could see our approach is not linearly scalable in terms of the length of sequence. As an extension of our previous work, this paper aims to improve the accuracy of the prediction rule in terms of the temporal constraint. We defined a new concept called temporal feature, and formulated the research problem of finding temporal features. Approaches was proposed to solve the identified problem. We also reported the experiment results of a real dataset.
 taking the pre-given window size for granted, we improve the accuracy of the prediction rules by minimizing the size of the prediction interval. It is also in-teresting to extend such a concept to other type of knowledge for perdition. A question could be: does there exist the minimal window size to make the knowledge interesting? Secondly, the identified problem can be utilized in the post-analysis of event-oriented mining results. For a discovered pattern which domain experts are specially interested in, we can borrow the idea of tempo-ral feature to find the minimal window sizes that make this pattern interesting for different thresholds of interestingness measures. Such analysis could provide detailed information of the relevance between the pattern and the target event.
