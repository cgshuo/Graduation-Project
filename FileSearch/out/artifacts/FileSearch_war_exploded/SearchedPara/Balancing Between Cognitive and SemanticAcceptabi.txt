 Argumentation is a verbal, social and rational activity [17]. It is also a daily activity in the sense that thinking hard has almost the same meaning as arguing oneself carefully. Meanwhile, it is unclear how one should engage in and facilitate rational argumenta-tion. This is because there seems to be no universal evaluation standard telling what rational argumentation is. However, in this paper, we argue that one aspect of such stan-dards is given by acceptability semantics, e.g., Dung X  X  acceptability semantics [13], as well as more advanced ones, e.g., stage semantics [18], semi-stable semantics [9], ideal semantics [14], CF2 semantics [4] and prudent semantics [11].
 [3] meaning that they intrinsically refer not to contents, e.g., sentences and words, ex-isting in arguments but to relations, e.g., attack and support relations, existing between arguments when they define acceptability status of arguments. We thus call them (for-mal) semantic acceptability in the sense that such contents do not directly affect evalu-ation 1 . By contrast, we call human judgment based on contents of arguments cognitive acceptability . Both acceptability might be the same in some situations, but different and moreover incompatible in other situations. As an example, let us consider the following two conflicting arguments A and B attached with their votes.
 Argument A (having 1001 positive votes) Veterinarians should have a right to apply Argument B (having 1002 positive votes) It is not acceptable to allow veterinarians ceptable at the same time because they are in conflict, i.e., attack each other. However, in terms of cognitive acceptability, A and B should be acceptable at the same time because they have a lot of positive votes. Now, does this situation show that agents who vote for both A and B are irrational or the truth is that there is no attack relation between these arguments? We think neither is true. The conflict is a result of rational judgment caused by focusing on different sources of information: on the one hand, a relation between arguments, and on the other hand, contents of arguments. Then, would it be reasonable to leave the conflict as it is, as the existing contradiction? We think that the acceptability should be at least compatible each other. Therefore, in this paper we investigate what kind of difference exists between cognitive and semantic acceptability, and how we should approximate and resolve them.
 difference in a unified way. Our novel approach is to introduce equilibriums to analyse balances between cognitive and semantic acceptability using an entailment relation of propositional logic. In this paper, we divide the difference into three types: satisfiability, entailment and semantic equivalence. We formalise a detection of unsatisfiability, and resolutions of satisfiability, entailment and semantic equivalence. We show that there always exist contraction-based satisfiability, entailment and semantic-equivalence res-olutions, and there always exist their expansion-based resolutions under the condition that agent X  X  perceptions do not violate conflict-freeness of acceptability semantics. this is the first paper arguing for the need for balancing between agent X  X  perceptions and semantic extensions. Although some recent work covers a change of agent X  X  perceptions and semantic extension, it handles a change of either of them and their balanced change is outside its scope (See Section 5). By benefitting from expression and analytical power of propositional logic, this paper makes it possible to handle sensitively balanced con-tractions and expansions of them (See Section 3). Secondly, this paper relates to both theory and practice of computational argumentation. In fact, we demonstrate how our theoretical concepts, i.e., equilibrium notions, highlight flaws of argument actually tak-ing place in an online forum, and suggest their possible resolutions (See Section 4). Dung X  X  acceptability semantics [13] is a general and abstract theory of formal argu-mentation. It is general in the sense that the semantics reinterprets consequence rela-tions of various approaches for nonmonotonic reasoning. It is abstract in the sense that the semantics is defined on a directed graph, called an abstract argumentation frame-work, denoted by AF . AF is defined as a pair  X  Args,Atts  X  where Args is a set of arguments and Atts  X  Args  X  Args is a binary relation on Args (( A,B )  X  Atts means  X  A attacks B  X ). Suppose A  X  Args and S  X  Args . S attacks A iff some member of S attacks A . S is conflict-free iff S attacks none of its members. S de-fends A iff S is conflict-free and S attacks all arguments attacking A . Given AF , Dung X  X  acceptability semantics defines four kinds of sets, called extensions, of ac-ceptable arguments. S is a complete extension iff S is a fixed point of the function F : Pow ( Args )  X  Pow ( Args ) where F ( S ) = { a | S defends a } and Pow ( Args ) is the power set of Args . S is a grounded (resp. preferred) extension iff it is the min-imum (resp. a maximal) complete extension with respect to set inclusion. S is a stable extension iff it is a complete extension attacking all members in Args \ S . We assume functions arg ( AF ) and att ( AF ) to refer to the set of arguments Args and attack rela-tions Atts of AF , respectively.
 Example 1. Let AF be the argumentation framework where arg ( AF ) = { A , B , C , D } , and att ( AF ) = { ( B,C ) , ( C,B ) , ( C,D ) , ( D,D ) } . The graph representation of AF and four types of extensions are described in the left and right below, respectively. 3.1 Semantic and cognitive acceptability We introduce a propositional language associated with an abstract argumentation frame-work. It is used to describe acceptability status of arguments in the framework. Definition 1 (Language). Let AF be an abstract argumentation framework. A propo-sitional language L AF associated with AF is defined as follows. For all arguments X  X  arg ( AF ) , x is an atomic formula of L AF . When x and y are formulas of L AF , ( x  X  y ) , ( x  X  y ) , ( x  X  y ) and  X  x are formulas of L AF .
 For all atomic formulas x  X  L AF ,  X  x is true X  intuitively means  X  X rgument X is accept-able. X  Given an extension, arguments are acceptable if and only if they are members of the extension. Different two extensions define alternative memberships. Therefore, a logical expression of extensions is defined as follows.
 Definition 2 (Extensions). Let AF be an abstract argumentation framework and E be a set of extensions of AF . A logical expression of E is given as follows 2 . Example 1 (continued). Logical expressions of all types of extensions of AF are given as follows.  X  Preferred extensions : { ( a  X  b  X  X  c  X  X  d )  X  ( a  X  X  b  X  c  X  X  d ) }  X  Stable extension: { a  X  X  b  X  c  X  X  d }  X  Grounded extension: { a  X  X  b  X  X  c  X  X  d }  X  Complete extensions: { ( a  X  X  b  X  X  c  X  X  d )  X  ( a  X  b  X  X  c  X  X  d )  X  ( a  X  X  b  X  c  X  X  d ) } AF and acceptability semantics  X  . We use function  X  ( AF ) to refer to the logical expres-sion of the set of extensions of AF with respect to  X  . We assume a fixed and arbitrary consistent set  X   X  L AF of formulas. On the one hand,  X  ( AF ) is used to represent semantic extensions, and on the other hand,  X  is used to represent cognitive extensions. 3.2 Satisfiability resolution This subsection discusses how to detect and resolve incompatibility between cognitive acceptability  X  and semantic acceptability  X  ( AF ) . A minimally unsatisfiable set is a minimal subset of cognitive acceptability that causes incompatibility with semantic ac-ceptability.
 Definition 3 (Minimally unsatisfiable set).  X   X   X  L AF is a minimally unsatisfiable set with respect to AF iff  X   X  is a minimal subset of  X  with respect to  X  such that  X  ( AF )  X   X   X  is unsatisfiable.
 An order relation between abstract argumentation frameworks is introduced to refer to maximality and minimality of frameworks.
 Definition 4 (Subframework/superframework). Let AF i and AF j be abstract argu-mentation frameworks. AF i is a subframework of AF j (or AF j is a superframework of An unsatisfiable core is intuitively a minimal subframework preserving incompatibility existing between AF and  X  .
 Definition 5 (Unsatisfiable core). An abstract argumentation framework AF  X  is an unsatisfiable core of AF with respect to  X  iff AF  X  is a minimal subframework of AF with respect to w such that there is a minimally unsatisfiable set  X   X   X   X  with respect to both AF and AF  X  .
 Example 2. Let us consider the following argumentation framework AF and the satis-fiable set  X  = { a,a  X  b,  X  c } X  L AF .
 ation,  X  1 = { a,a  X  b } and  X  2 = { a,  X  c } are minimally unsatisfiable sets with respect to AF . The following AF 1 and AF 2 are the unsatisfiable cores of AF with respect to  X  . tic acceptability. When we consider the situation where semantic acceptability imposes cognitive acceptability to change, a possible resolution is to change the cognitive ac-ceptability. A maximally satisfiable set is a maximal subset of the cognitive acceptabil-ity that causes no incompatibility with the semantic acceptability. Definition 6 (Maximally satisfiable set).  X   X   X   X  is a maximally satisfiable set with respect to AF iff  X   X  is a maximal subset of  X  with respect to  X  such that  X  ( AF )  X   X   X  is satisfiable.
 Meanwhile, when we consider the situation where cognitive acceptability imposes on semantic acceptability to change, a possible resolution is to contract or expand AFs. Each maximally and minimally satisfiable framework represents a contraction and ex-pansion of AFs, respectively.
 Definition 7 (Maximally/minimally satisfiable framework). Let AF l be an abstract argumentation framework. AF l is a maximally (resp. minimally) satisfiable framework with respect to  X  iff AF l is a maximal subframework (resp. minimal superframework) of AF with respect to w such that  X  ( AF l )  X   X  is satisfiable.
 A contraction is appropriate when an AF is uncertain in the sense that existence of argu-ments and attacks is unclear. An expansion is appropriate when an AF is incomplete in the sense that there can exist additional arguments or attacks. A satisfiability resolution is defined as an equilibrium point between cognitive and semantic acceptability. Definition 8 (Satisfiability resolutions). Let AF l be an abstract argumentation frame-work and  X   X   X   X  be a set. The pair ( AF l , X   X  ) is a satisfiability resolution of ( AF, X  ) iff  X   X  is a maximally satisfiable set with respect to AF l and AF l is a maximally or minimally satisfiable framework with respect to  X   X  .
 In particular, we call satisfiability resolutions contraction-based when they are based on maximally satisfiable frameworks, and expansions-based when they are based on minimally satisfiable frameworks.
 Example 2 (continued). All possible contraction-based and expansion-based satisfia-bility resolutions of ( AF, X  ) are described in the left and right below, respectively. ( , { a } ) ( , { a  X  b,  X  c } ) ( , { a,a  X  b,  X  c } ) Here, the domain of discourse for possible expansions of AF is assumed to be given by the complete graph AF D as follows. 3.3 Entailment resolution This subsection deals with the issue that semantic acceptability cannot entail cognitive acceptability. The first approach for solving this problem is to change cognitive accept-ability. We define a maximally entailed set as follows. Definition 9 (Maximally entailed set).  X   X   X   X  is a maximally entailed set with re-spect to AF iff  X   X  is a maximal subset of  X  with respect to  X  such that  X  ( AF ) | =  X   X  holds 3 .
 The second approach is to contract or expand argumentation frameworks defining se-mantic acceptability. Both maximally and minimally entailing frameworks are minimal changes of AFs whose semantic acceptability entails cognitive acceptability. Definition 10 (Maximally/minimally entailing framework). Let AF l be an abstract argumentation framework. AF l is a maximally (resp. minimally) entailing framework with respect to  X  iff AF l is a maximal subframework (resp. minimal superframework) of AF with respect to w such that  X  ( AF l ) | =  X  holds.
 An entailment resolution is defined as an equilibrium point between the acceptabilities. Definition 11 (Entailment resolutions). Let AF l be an abstract argumentation frame-work and  X   X   X   X  be a set. The pair ( AF l , X   X  ) is an entailment resolution of ( AF, X  ) iff  X   X  is a maximally entailed set with respect to AF l and AF l is a maximally entailing framework with respect to  X   X  .
 We call entailment resolutions contraction-based (resp. expansion-based) when they are based on maximally (resp. minimally) entailing frameworks.
 Example 2 (continued). All possible contraction-based and expansion-based entailment resolutions of ( AF, X  ) are described in the left and right below, respectively. ( ,  X  ) ( , { a } ) ( , { a } ) ( , { a  X  b,  X  c } ) ( , { a,a  X  b,  X  c } ) 3.4 Semantically equivalence resolution This subsection asks how to make cognitive and semantic acceptability coincide with each other. The first approach is to change cognitive acceptability. A maximally (resp. minimally) equivalent set is a maximal subset (resp. minimal superset) of the cognitive acceptability that is equivalent to the semantic acceptability.
 Definition 12 (Maximally/minimally equivalent set).  X  l  X  L AF is a maximally (resp. minimally) equivalent set with respect to AF iff  X  l is a maximal subset (resp. minimal superset) of  X  with respect to  X  such that  X  l  X   X  ( AF ) 4 holds. The second approach is to change AFs defining semantic acceptability. Both maximally and minimally equivalent frameworks are minimal changes of AF whose semantic ac-ceptability is equivalent to the cognitive acceptability.
 Definition 13 (Maximally/minimally equivalent framework). Let AF l be an ab-stract argumentation framework. AF l is a maximally (resp. minimally) equivalent frame-work with respect to  X  iff AF l is a maximal subframework (resp. minimal superframe-work) of AF with respect to w such that  X   X   X  ( AF  X  ) holds.
 A semantic equivalence resolution is formally defined as an equilibrium point between cognitive and semantic acceptability.
 Definition 14 (Semantically equivalence resolutions). Let AF l be an abstract ar-gumentation framework and  X  l  X  L AF be a set. The pair ( AF l , X  l ) is a semantic equivalence resolution of ( AF, X  ) iff  X  l is a maximally or minimally equivalent set with respect to AF l and AF l is a maximally or minimally equivalent framework with respect to  X  l .
 Example 2 (continued). There is a unique contraction-based semantic equivalence res-olution of ( AF, X  ) . based semantic equivalence resolution. Meanwhile, there is no expansion-based se-mantic equivalence resolution of ( AF, X  ) . So, we here consider another example with  X   X  = { a  X  b,c } . We assume a set  X  D  X  L AF expansions of  X   X  where AF D is the complete graph as shown in the previous example. There is the following expansion-based semantic equivalence resolution of ( AF, X   X  ) . 4.1 Characterising existence of resolutions In this subsection, we show the necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence of our equilibrium-based resolutions. We use the model checking techniques [7] to analyse argumentation theoretic properties of equilibriums. According to the literature, a set S  X  arg ( AF ) of arguments is conflict-free iff the set { x  X  L AF | X  X  S } is a model of the formula  X  AF defined as follows.
 fixing,  X  expansion and  X  contraction. The first theorem supposes the situation where  X  is fixed in expansion-based resolutions. Theorem 1. For any AF and consistent set  X   X  L AF , there exist abstract argumen-tation frameworks AF  X  such that ( AF  X  , X  ) are expansion-based satisfiability (entail-ment, respectively) resolutions of ( AF, X  ) iff  X  do not violate the conflict-free property, i.e.,  X  6| =  X   X  AF .
 There does not always exist an expansion-based semantic equivalence resolution ( AF  X  , X  ) even when  X  do not violate the conflict-free property. An example case is when AF =  X  X  A } ,  X  X  and  X  =  X  . The next two theorems suppose the situations where  X  can be expanded and contracted in expansion-based resolutions, respectively.
 Theorem 2. For any AF and consistent set  X   X  L AF , there exist abstract argumen-tation frameworks AF  X  and supersets  X   X  of  X  such that ( AF  X  , X   X  ) are expansion-based satisfiability (entailment and semantic equivalence, respectively) resolutions of ( AF, X  ) iff  X  do not violate the conflict-free property, i.e.,  X  6| =  X   X  AF . Theorem 3. For any AF and consistent set  X   X  L AF , there exist abstract argumen-tation frameworks AF  X  and subsets  X   X  of  X  such that ( AF  X  , X   X  ) are expansion-based satisfiability (entailment, respectively) resolutions of ( AF, X  ) .
  X   X  =  X  , as special cases, respectively. The next theorem regarding contraction-based resolutions supposes the situation where  X  is fixed.
 Theorem 4. For any AF and consistent set  X   X  L AF , there exists an abstract ar-gumentation framework AF  X  such that ( AF  X  , X  ) is a contraction-based satisfiability resolution of ( AF, X  ) .
 There does not always exist an entailment and semantic equivalence resolution. For example, when AF =  X  X  A } ,  X  X  and  X  = { X  a } , there is neither entailment nor semantic equivalence resolution. The next two theorems suppose the situations where  X  can be expanded and contracted in contraction-based resolutions, respectively.
 Theorem 5. For any AF and consistent set  X   X  L AF , there exist an abstract argu-mentation framework AF  X  and a superset  X   X  of  X  such that ( AF  X  , X   X  ) is a contraction-based satisfiability resolution of ( AF, X  ) .
 Theorem 6. For any AF and consistent set  X   X  L AF , there exist abstract argumen-tation frameworks AF  X  and subsets  X   X  of  X  such that ( AF  X  , X   X  ) are contraction-based satisfiability (entailment and semantic equivalence, respectively) resolutions of ( AF, X  ) .  X  . Symbol  X  X  X  means that there exists a resolution. Meanwhile,  X (conditional) X  means that there exists a resolution if and only if  X  does not violate the conflict-free property. These facts show generality of equilibriums-based approaches in the sense that they have the ability to give resolutions for all types of equilibriums. 4.2 Application illustration in online forum Application potential is one of important criteria for evaluating accuracy of research proposals. This subsection illustrates application possibility of our equilibrium based resolutions in argumentation analysis in online debate forums.
 casted votes, and relationships, e.g., dispute, support and clarification relations, among arguments. On the left in Figure 1, we show a whole dispute structure and a summary of users X  votes that are both extracted from argument on abortion actually taking place in CreateDebate. The edges represent the whole dispute relations and the white (resp. black) nodes represent that they get user X  X  positive votes above (resp. below) average. On the right in Figure 1, we show a partial graph of the left that especially focuses on discussing a specific subject on abortion. We represent it as an abstract argumentation framework, denoted by AF , with a symmetric attack relation, i.e., if ( X,Y )  X  att ( AF ) then ( Y,X )  X  att ( AF ) , for all X,Y  X  arg ( AF ) . We assume that  X  ( AF ) represents the logical expression of the set of preferred extensions. We define agents X  cognitions  X  from the votes to individual arguments in such a way that x  X   X  holds when node X is white and  X  x  X   X  holds when node X is black.

The inconsistent cores verify consistency between acceptance of arguments coming from the argumentation structure and user X  X  votes. They are useful in the sense that they tell where people should pay attention to resolve incompatibility between agent cognitions and semantic extensions.

 ment resolution and a contraction-based semantic equivalence resolution.
 one-directional. Note that the entailment resolution has the contraction  X  \{ X  f } , but the semantic equivalence resolution has the expansion  X   X  X  e,  X  k,q } . Note that a semantic equivalence resolution is stricter than an entailment resolution, and an entailment reso-lution is stricter than a satisfiability resolution. Each type of resolution corresponds to agent X  X  attitude of how much closeness between cognitive and semantic acceptability they require. Our motivation of this work is that, as with us human beings, agent X  X  perceptive de-velopment can be achieved by resolving the gaps between cognitive and semantic ac-ceptability. In this paper, we introduced equilibrium-based satisfiability resolutions, en-tailment resolutions and semantic equivalence resolutions. We showed generality of our proposal by proving existence conditions of their resolutions. We demonstrated the application possibility in online forums. The limitations of this paper is that our equilibrium-based resolutions mention nothing about sentences additional arguments should have. Our expansion-based resolutions only mention about an attack relation that additional arguments should have with other arguments.
 frameworks (AFs). [10] proposes a typology of revisions of AFs in terms of changes on extensions. [5] addresses a problem of how to modify AFs so that a desired set of arguments becomes an extension of revised AFs. [6] handles changes of AFs by in-Makinson) postulates [1]. These research studies commonly focus on changes of AFs. In contrast, [16] focuses on belief revisions on agents X  perceptions about acceptability status of arguments, and provide web-platform ArgTech that alerts users to irrational agents X  perceptions through incompatibility checking with the complete labelling [2]. [8, 15] focus on changes of both AFs and agents X  perceptions, and deal with resolutions of incoherence of agent X  X  beliefs by expanding AF and constraints on its outcomes. In contrast, we primarily focus on balancing between perceptions (or constraints) and out-comes of argumentation. We thus introduce equilibrium mechanisms to handle simulta-neous changes of them although the related work handles, at most, each of them. Notice that the resolutions analysed in Section 4.2 can only be achieved as an equilibrium, and a change of either AF or agents X  perceptions is a special case of our equilibrium-based resolutions. Moreover, although the related work focuses on expansions and incoher-ence ( X  X atisfiability X  in this paper), this paper further deals with contraction and intro-duces entailment and semantic equivalence resolutions.
