Hence the research of system coherency has been made by numerous researchers [1-4]. However, most of the studies are focused on the dynamic grouping. distances, and so on. In this paper, grouping the locations in a networked system with similar locational prices has been proposed considering the regional coherency. network of the systems, the good is lost as it is transmitted from supplying locations to consuming locations, and an additional supply must be provided to compensate the loss. Also, the transmission network of the systems has a capacity limitation node, is differently decided depending the network topology and supply/demand configuration. Similarity measure has been known as the complementary meaning of previous literatures, we had constructed similarity measure through distance measure or fuzzy entropy function [10]. Well known-Hamming distance was used to construct FCM and similarity measure are introduced and proved. In Section 3, similarity information. In Section 4, illustrative examples are shown. In the example, we obtain Conclusions are followed in Section 5. Notations of Liu's are used in this paper [5]. Fuzzy C-means clustering was proposed by Bezdek in 1973 as an improvement over HCM(Hard C-means)[10]. FCM play a roll of partitioning arbitrary n vectors into c fuzzy groups, also it finds a cluster center for each group such that a cost function of similarity measure is maximized, or dissimilarity measure is minimized. Well known fact about FCM and HCM indicates that FC M employs fuzzy partitioning such that a data point can belong to several groups with the degree of membership grades between 0 and 1. 2.1 Preliminaries follows Where ij u is between 0 and 1, i c is the center of fuzzy group i , reach a minimum are [11] function become. Hence distance means the similarity between two data points. sound, etc .. Now we need proper similarity measure. In this subsection, we introduce applied to our problem. 2.2 Similarity Measure with Distance Function We define modified similarity measure, which is different from that of Liu's. measure for regional point, if s has the following properties : measure. measure, then is the similarity measure between set A and B . commutativity of set A and B , hence it is clear from (3) itself. From (S2), measure. Similarly, we propose another similarity measure in the following theorem. measure, then is the similarity measure between set A and set B . Proof. Proofs are shown similarly as Theorem 2.1. In the previous section we have derived the modified similarity measures which whose similar measure values are close, however they are located far away. Then it is consider where distance is the geometrical distance value. We consider the combined similarity measure as values. follows: For all ) ( , X P B A  X  , inequality of (S3) is proved by verified. where ) distance( A,C is longer than ). distance( A,B is satisfied. Hence we can verify that ) , ( 2 B A s satisfies the Definition 2.1. same time. Modified similarity measures are used in the following example. system which has characteristic values and regional information at the same time. As IEEE reliability test system which is prepared by the reliability test system task force of the application of probability methods subcommittee on 1996 [12] is considered as a test system. In the test system, 39 nodes (buses) and 10 generators are contained and each bus has its own locational price and information. additional generation must be supplied to provide energy in excess of that consumed by customers. Moreover, the capacity limitation of the transmission network of each node is differently decided depe nding on the network topology and energy configuration. 
The electricity prices at each node is defi ned as locational prices at each node and the locational prices represent the locational value of energy, which includes the cost congestion. In Table 1 each locational price per kWh are illustrated for the 39 buses, and per unit geometrical information for each nodes are also shown. information are represented through 2-dimensional plane at which plane is assumed to be flat. Considered combined similarity measures constitute as follows with the proposed measure: locational information and height means the locational price. 3 dimensional 39 consideration. This strict condition does not satisfies the user's request. Hence we will consider the locational price and locational information simultaneously. 
Next, we consider weighting values 1  X  and 2  X  as 0.2 and 0.8 respectively. Results  X  elements are also changed as  X  . 0.8 respectively. In Fig. 4, there is just one circle compared with Fig. 3. However Fig. 4 has more changes than Fig. 3 if we consider initial condition of Fig. 2. in Fig. 4. In final result we cannot notice any special changing, however there are so determine weighting values properly for the useful applications. networked system in terms of an appropriate similarity measure, regional information paper, therefore, we have proposed a modified similarity measure accompanied with the results, we can check the coherency between the degree of similarity level and the number of clusters.
