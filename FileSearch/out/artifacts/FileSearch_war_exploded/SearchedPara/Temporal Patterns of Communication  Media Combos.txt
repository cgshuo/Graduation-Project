 Today X  X  employees are expected to be adept at the usage of multi-ple communication mediums. With secretaries now regarded as a frivolous luxury, people have essentially become professional  X  X ec-retaries X  of their own interactions. A large body of research in the HCI and CSCW literature has examined how information work-ers have appropriated certain communication mediums in order to accomplish work. However, how people must combine and inte-grate a multitude of media adroitly throughout a limited workday (approximately 8 hours) has been relatively ignored. Namely, I propose to examine through a combination of qualitative and quan-titative techniques the temporal and sequential interdependence of different kinds of media . I will examine how/why such media com-bos arise and their psychological affects in the workplace.

Communication has long been a subject of intense investigation in the academic community. Linguistic [12] and social psychology theories [13] have been developed to explain how it is that people artfully carry out dialogue. As new communicative technologies have been introduced in the office, the effects of such technologies in the workplace have been of prime concern among organizational, HCI, and CSCW researchers. Research has traced the arrival of  X  X lassic X  technologies such as telegraph, copier, and the telephone [19] to the office. The advent of  X  X ewer X  technologies such as email [8] , instant messaging [10], and video conferencing [3] into the corporation has also been closely scrutinized. These research have focused on the novel usage patterns of a single technology, but there has been research framed around how and why people choose cer-tain media types when communicating at work. This has given rise to media choice theory [2] and its later enhancements [17]. This popular theory has however been criticized [9, 18].

I believe these studies into communication at the workplace have typically ignored the temporal dimension [1, 11]. Such research typically focuses in on brief snapshots or events. Survey-based or experimental approaches have been criticized as unable to realisti-cally gauge how people use technology in the everyday course of their workdays [5]. Naturalistic studies on the flow of an informa-tion worker X  X  day have started to highlight office work X  X  frenetic and ephemeral makeup [7].

My research attempts to ameliorate this deficit in the literature by acknowledging that information workers utilize a multitude of communication mediums to accomplish work, and that this work is situated among a limited timescale, the workday.
My research will build upon my previous work into communi-cation in the workplace by utilizing temporal data mining tech-niques in combination with ethnographic inquiry to examine a large dataset I have collected from two field sites by shadowing 30 peo-ple, each individually for three whole workdays (approx. 24 hours per informant, 720 hours of total data). Shadowing involves meet-ing the informant at the beginning of the workday, and following the informant as closely as possible till close of business. The start and end times of events (e.g., telephoning someone or receiving an email) are recorded to the second. Surveys measuring stress and polychronicity were administered to each informant.

My first study [15] asked whether just as people switch between projects rapidly [4], do people switch briskly between groups of people as well? Using a grounded theory approach [14], I derived the concept of workplace connectors to describe categories of in-teractions that people share (e.g., work home X  X ne X  X  own business unit, common workrole X  X oworkers in different departments but of the same job position). I found that regardless of the workplace connector, people X  X  individual interactions lasted only 3 minutes. I also found that people used certain technologies to effectively man-age their workplace connectors (e.g., IM for private conversations). Lastly, even though the total time spent in some connectors was little, people still valued those workplace connectors (e.g., interac-tions outside the work home allowed one to gain a global perspec-tive of the company).

My second study [16] examined  X  X hains X  of communication, in-teractions (IM, email, face-to-face, and phone) that happen one af-ter another in quick succession. I found that chains are a real phe-nomenon at work: people experience 27 chains per day, with an av-erage length of 2.5  X  X inks X  and an average duration of five minutes. A significant relation was found between people who experienced lengthy chains of long duration and workplace stress. Moreover, chains that involved lots of workplace connector switching (e.g., speaking in the work home and then with someone in the common workrole) were significantly more stressful. However, I found that chains that had a large amount of media switching (e.g., F2F-email-phone vs. F2F-F2F-F2F) actually had significantly less stress. We surmised that high media switching was indicative of competent interaction management.

During my shadowing, I observed that people combine and use media in resourceful ways: Though preliminary, these statements examine the interdependent, contextual, and temporal nature of multiple communication types in the workplace. My dissertation work will involve first using quantitative techniques to discover significant temporal patterns of communication, and then use qualitative techniques to discern classes of these media combos .
I will use a relatively new temporal analysis technique called T-pattern detection [6] to narrow down what media combos should be analyzed qualitatively. Briefly, T-pattern detection will discern what are the statistically significant patterns of communication oc-curring in the workday. Unlike previous approaches such as Markov analysis, T-pattern analysis takes time into account. For example,  X  X mail followed by telephone within a minute X  may be discovered as a commonly recurring, non-spurious pattern. Importantly, this allows that something happens in between the email and telephone (an advantage over solely sequential methods).

My next step will be to use the T-patterns found as pointers to go back to the qualitative data. This includes raw paper notes, video recordings, and computer screenshots (10 of 30 informants were taped and logged during shadowing, for all three days). One can then label each media combo into a specific category. For exam-ple, looking at instances of  X  X mail followed by telephone within a minute X  pattern might reveal that the telephone call was used to  X  X aise the priority X  of email X  X .e., to make sure the recipient of the email checked his or her email and paid special attention to it.
We do not have a priori categories but will use grounded theory and an ethnomethodological approach (video data) to derive cate-gories. We will then have basic counts of each media combo and its type/purpose. Visualizations can be then be developed to plot the prevalence of media combos during certain times of day to get an idea of the periodicity of the data.

Once coding has commenced, I plan to develop statistical mod-els (e.g., linear regression) for stress and polychronicity with media combos X  attributes as predictors. Furthermore, cluster analyses can allow us to discern what kinds of days people have with respect to their communication patterns (i.e., what media combos are uti-lized). For example, we may see that on some days people expe-rience a large usage of certain combos during lunchtime. As with the T-patterns, I will perform qualitative analysis using the clusters as pointers to see why certain T-patterns are used in certain times of the day.
In my work, I hope to unpack the temporal routines of communi-cation in the workday, and to see what psychological affects these have on workers. I expect to contribute to the ethnomethodological corpus by accounting (e.g., through new theories) for how people maintain, utilize and form combinations of communication to ac-complish work competently.
